[[File:Abraham Hulk the Elder - Fishing boats on a shore.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Painting by Abraham Hulk the Elder]]

'''Abraham Hulk Senior''' (1 May 1813 in London - 23 March 1897 in [[Zevenaar]]) was an [[Anglo-Dutch]] painter, [[drawing|draughtsman]]  and  [[lithography|lithographer]]. He initially trained as a portraitist, but became a well-known as a marine-painter and the patriarch of a whole family of Anglo-Dutch artists.

==Biography==
Hulk was born in London, the son of the merchant Hendrik Hulk and Mary Burroughs.  He trained as a portrait painter under [[Jean Augustin Daiwaille]] (1786–1850) before continuing his artistic education at the Rijksacademie in Amsterdam.

During 1833 and 1834 he travelled to America, visiting New York and Boston, and exhibiting in the latter city. In 1834 he returned to Amsterdam, where he lived until 1855, when he relocated to [[Nijkerk]], later moving to [[Enkhuizen]], then to Haarlem, back to Amsterdam, then to [[Oosterbeek]], before returning to Amsterdam once more. In 1870 he settled in England, where he spent the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=rkd1&gt;{{cite web|title=Abraham  Hulk (I)|url=https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/artists/record?query=abraham+hulk&amp;start=1|publisher=RKD|accessdate=29 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became well-known because he seemed to have the ability to paint the sea and its ships in such a different way for which he became one of the great marine painters. Some of his portraits have survived. His work was exhibited in the [[Royal Academy]] in London from 1876 to 1890 where he entered three paintings of which two were Dutch seascapes. He also exhibited at the [[Royal Society of British Artists|Suffolk Street Galleries]] in London and in Leeuwarden and The Hague in the Netherlands from 1843 to 1868.

==Family==
Other painters  in his family included his younger brother [[Johannes Frederik Hulk|Johannes Frederik Hulk Senior]] (1829–1911),  his sons  Hendrik Hulk (1842-1937),  Abraham Hulk Junior (1843–1919) and Willem Frederik Hulk (b.1852)&lt;ref name=rkd1/&gt; and his nephew Johannes Frederik Hulk (1855–1913).  Abraham Hulk Senior married Maria Wilhelmina van der Meulen; as well as the sons named above they had two daughters, Maria Cornelia Hulk (born 1838) and Hendrika Geertruida Petronella Hulk (born 1841). 

Abraham Senior was the teacher of his brother Johannes Frederik and several other members of his family, and also of the painter [[Adrianus David Hilleveld]].&lt;ref name=rkd1/&gt;

==Death==
Although most literature states that he died in London, he actually died on a short visit in Zevenaar in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-266-12568-61006-4?cc=1554394&amp;wc=5816197|title=Netherlands, Gelderland Province Civil Registration, 1800-1952 Image Netherlands, Gelderland Province Civil Registration, 1800-1952; pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-266-12568-61006-4 — FamilySearch.org|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Museums==
His works hang in the Amsterdam, Dordrecht, Haarlem and Enschede museums.

"'''Anthology of Interest II'''" is the 18th episode of ''[[Futurama]]''{{'}}s [[Futurama (season 3)|third season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on January 6, 2002. This episode, as well as the earlier "[[Anthology of Interest I]]", serves to showcase three "imaginary" stories.
==Plot==
Professor Farnsworth hauls out his What-If Machine again, fine-tunes it, and the crew takes a look at three alternative realities.
===I, Meatbag===
[[Bender Bending Rodríguez|Bender]] asks what would happen if he were human. The simulation opens with [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] announcing that he has invented a process of reverse [[Petrifaction|fossilization]], which can turn robots and machines into organic life-forms. He uses his process on Bender, who is transformed into a human. After a short period of adaptation, Bender's self-control is overwhelmed by his new senses of taste and touch, and goes on a binge of eating, smoking, partying, and drinking alcohol. 
A week later, at the [[Nobel Prize]] judging, the Professor presents Bender, who has become an overweight blob. The committee initially condemns Farnsworth, but Bender begs them to consider his lifestyle. This inspires the scientists to spend the night in a state of wild [[hedonism]]. The next morning, the hungover committee awards Bender the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], but discover that he died the moment the party began. The "woo!" noises that the partygoers assumed were from Bender were actually caused by air escaping the many folds of fat on his body. The Planet Express crew sadly roll away Bender's corpse.
===Raiders of the Lost Arcade===
[[Philip J. Fry|Fry]] asks to see a world that is more like a video game. As the simulation starts, President of Earth [[Richard Nixon]] is preparing to sign a treaty with Ambassador [[Donkey Kong (character)|Kong]] of planet [[Nintendo 64|Nintenduu 64]]. Ambassador Kong attacks Nixon, and a state of war erupts.
Due to his extensive knowledge of video games from the 20th Century, Fry is brought to the [[Military|Mil]][[atari]] headquarters and introduced to General [[Colin Powell|Colin]] [[Pac-Man]]. Before Fry can impart his wisdom to the military, the Nintendians launch an attack on [[Washington, D.C.]], and they are forced into the escape tunnels, which resemble a [[Pac-Man]] board.
They emerge outside the Planet Express building, where the Nintendian invaders, led by [[List of recurring characters in Futurama#Lrrr|Lrrr]], are blasting New New York. Fry situates himself at the controls of a rolling [[anti-aircraft artillery]] platform, and begins destroying the alien ships in a manner similar to [[Space Invaders]]. Fry is unable to destroy the final ship, which lands nearby. The invaders emerge and demand "a million allowances worth of quarters" with which to do their laundry. The Earthlings refuse. The invaders suggest they be allowed to throw their laundry in with Earth's as a compromise, and the Earthlings agree.
===Wizzin'===
[[Leela (Futurama)|Leela]] asks what if she found her true home. However, when the lever is pulled to start the simulation, it hits Leela on the head and knocks her unconscious, prompting her to dream a parody of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' with Leela as [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]], Nibbler as [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]], Amy as [[Glinda the Good Witch]], Fry as the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|Scarecrow]], Bender as the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]], Zoidberg as the [[Cowardly Lion|Cowardly Lobster]], and Professor Fansworth as [[Wizard of Oz (character)|the Professor of Oz]].
Leela and Nibbler, while riding in the Planet Express ship, are taken by tornado to Oz. The ship's landing gear lands on the Wicked Witch of the East, killing her. Leela takes the witch's magic boots from her corpse and puts them on, since it is hard to find footwear in her size. She asks Amy for help getting back home, and Amy tells her that only The Professor at the Emerald Laboratory can send her home. Leela is joined in her quest by Fry, Bender, and Zoidberg. They all are captured by Wicked Witch [[Mom (Futurama)|Mom]] who asks Leela to be her witch daughter. Leela happily agrees, but when Bender pops opens a celebratory bottle of champagne, the spilled liquid causes Mom to melt into nothing. They resume their journey to the Emerald Laboratory, where The Professor tells Leela to click her boot heels together and wish to be sent back home. Instead, she uses them to become a witch and turns Fry, Bender and The Professor into toads. However, a toilet overflow in the upstairs bathroom (caused by Zoidberg's use of it) leaks through the ceiling and onto Leela, causing her to melt. She wakes up to find Bender splashing water in her face and berates the crew for showing up in her wonderful dream and ruining it.

==Cultural references==
===I, Meatbag===
In a split-second establishing shot of New New York before the Professor's press conference, the towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] are seen. This episode aired on January 6, 2002, about 4 months after the towers were destroyed.&lt;br&gt;
The song that Bender becomes infatuated with as a human is "[[Conga (song)|Conga]]" by [[Gloria Estefan]]. The title of the segment is a nod to the [[Isaac Asimov]] collection of short stories ''[[I, Robot]]''.

===Raiders of the Lost Arcade===
[[File:Anthology Of Interest II SpaceInvaders.png|thumb|left|A parody of the game ''[[Space Invaders]]'']]
The "Raiders of the Lost Arcade" segment is a "non-stop barrage of game references" with jokes and allusions referencing a wide array of classic video games.&lt;ref name="GameLife" /&gt; The title is a reference to the 1981 film ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''. The segment starts off with a sequence from ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''. "Ambassador Kong" is a reference to the arcade game ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'', as is [[Italy]]'s ambassador to the U.N. being [[Mario]]. The maze which the characters run through is an homage to both ''[[Pac-Man]]'' and ''[[Ms. Pac-Man]]''.&lt;ref name="GameLife" /&gt; Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man both appear in the episode (Pac-Man as General Colin Pacman, and Ms. Pac-Man as his wife/widow).
The Nintendians' fleet is composed of ''[[Space Invaders]]'' ships, which move in the same pattern as those in the video game ("Drop down, increase speed, and reverse direction!").&lt;ref name="GameLife"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/12/video-games-fut.html| title=Videogames &amp; Futurama, Part 1: Raiders of the Lost Arcade| author= Baker, Chris| date= 2007-12-17| accessdate= 2008-02-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080128151750/http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/12/video-games-fut.html| archivedate= 28 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no| work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fry plays to the accompaniment of a [[cassette tape]] of "[[Tom Sawyer (song)|Tom Sawyer]]" by [[Rush (band)|Rush]]. The planet Nintendu 64 is a reference to the game console [[Nintendo 64]]. When the [[Atari|Milatari]] HQ is first shown, the green tank from ''[[Battlezone (arcade game)|Battlezone]]'' is driving past.&lt;ref name="GameLife" /&gt; When the characters walk through the HQ, they go past doors labelled [[Moon Patrol]] and [[Missile Command]]. As the video game villains (Lrrr, Donkey Kong, a [[Berzerk (arcade game)|Berzerk]] robot, a [[Robotron]] brain, ''[[BurgerTime]]''{{'}}s Mr. Egg, and [[Q*bert]]) exit the landed ship, one character says the phrase "[[All your base are belong to us]]".

===Wizzin'===
The majority of the plot is a direct parody of the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', with Leela taking the place of Dorothy, Amy as the Good Witch of the North, Fry as the Scarecrow, Bender as the Tin Man, Zoidberg as the Cowardly Lion, Professor Farnsworth as the Wizard and Mom as the Wicked Witch of the West. When Leela first exits the spaceship, a parody of the [[NBC]] peacock logo is seen spreading its feathers.

'''"Atlantis"''' is a song written and recorded by [[Scotland|Scottish]] singer/songwriter [[Donovan]]. It was released as a [[single (music)|single]] in 1968 (see [[1968 in music]]) and became a worldwide success; becoming a No.1 hit in [[Switzerland]] in 1969 (see [[1969 in music]]),&lt;ref name="swi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chart History |work=Swisscharts |url=http://swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=No+Angels+%26+Donovan&amp;titel=Atlantis+%2F+When+The+Angels+Sing&amp;cat=s |accessdate=2007-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511030513/http://swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=No+Angels+&amp;+Donovan&amp;titel=Atlantis+%2F+When+The+Angels+Sing&amp;cat=s |archivedate=2006-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No.2 in [[Germany]] and [[South Africa]], No.12 in [[Canada]], and No.4 in  [[Austria]]. In the [[United States]], where it served as the [[b-side]] to "To Susan on the West Coast, Waiting," it reached No.7, whilst in the singer's native country the single managed only a modest No.23 placing.

In 2001, Donovan and German pop band [[No Angels]] re-recorded the track for the [[closing credits]] of the [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] picture ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'' (2001). Included on a [[wikt:concomitant|concomitant]] album for the German-speaking music market,&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; it was once more released as a single and re-entered the top five in [[Austria]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="swi"/&gt;

==1968 version==

===Theme===
The introduction is a quiet monologue regarding the idea that [[Atlantis]] was a highly advanced [[antediluvian]] civilization, and that Atlantean colonists were the basis of the mythological gods of ancient times. Aware of their fate, the Atlanteans sent out ships to carry the preservation of their civilization, thereby spreading it across the world. Later on, the song conveys the message that the singer's true love may be in Atlantis. The overall theme is common for the 1960s: fanciful mythology as the symbol of the counterculture movement, with the hope that true love will be found if ever Atlantis can be reached.

===Possible Paul McCartney contribution===
{{undue weight|section|date=September 2017}}
Many believe that the song "Atlantis" contains background vocals by [[Paul McCartney]]. Backing up that claim is Harry Castleman and Walter Podrazik's book, ''All Together Now: The First Complete Beatles Discography, 1961—1975'' (New York: Ballantine Books, 1976, p.&amp;nbsp;384), which states that McCartney not only provided the background vocals but also played the tambourine on the song.

However, according to Donovan in a 2008 interview with Goldmine Magazine, McCartney did not sing the backing vocals.&lt;ref name="Goldmine"&gt;[http://www.goldminemag.com/article/donovan-the-sunshine-superman-part-ii Goldmine Magazine], October 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The album's liner notes, which state that the song was recorded in Los Angeles in November 1968, do not list  McCartney as a performer on the album.

Also, the works of Beatles expert [[Mark Lewisohn]] do not support the statement. Neither ''The Complete Beatles Chronicles'' (New York: Harmony Books, 1992) nor  ''The Beatles Day by Day: A Chronology 1962-1989'' (New York: Harmony Books, 1987 &amp; 1990) mentions McCartney's participation on this song. According to Lewisohn's chronology, (Lewisohn, ''The Beatles Day by Day'', page 110) McCartney spent the month of November 1968 mostly at his farm in Scotland.

===Release and reception===
Contract disputes at the time caused a complicated series of different releases in the United Kingdom and United States. It was originally released in the UK as a single with "I Love My Shirt" as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. In 1969 it was released in the US on the album ''[[Barabajagal]]''. The LP was not released in the UK, however, and "Atlantis" was next released in the US as the B-side to "To Susan on the West Coast Waiting".

The song was not deemed likely to be a hit in the US because of its length and the fact that the first third of the song is spoken prose and therefore not "radio-friendly". It was for this reason that, despite its success in Europe, "Atlantis" was demoted to B-side status. However, the record company A&amp;R executives were proved wrong when the popularity of "Atlantis" far surpassed that of its A-side.  The song was quite successful, reaching #7 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] charts, and the song itself became an anthem of the [[hippie]] movement.

===Production and recording===
In the late 1990s, [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] started production on ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]'', an [[animation|animated]] [[science fiction]]/[[action film]], based on the [[Atlantis]] saga. Interested in slipping his 1968 version into the [[Atlantis: The Lost Empire (soundtrack)|film soundtrack]], Donovan immediately opened negotiations with the studios; however Disney was barely interested in the song and plans eventually fell through.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; By [[2000 in film|2000]], Disney had committed [[Germany|German]] [[music producer|producer]] [[Leslie Mándoki]] to produce a concomitant album for the German-speaking music markets, entitled ''Stars Inspired by Atlantis''.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt; After stumbling over the original song, Mándoki approached Donovan by phone, describing him his idea of a collaboration with German newcomers [[No Angels]], with whom Mándoki had previously worked on their debut ''[[Elle'ments]]'' (2001), and a few days later Donovan and the band met at the [[Lake Starnberg]] to start recording.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web|first=Dirk|last=Peitz|title=Mit 'Atlantis' aus der Versenkung|work=Rhein Zeitung|url=http://rhein-zeitung.de/on/01/11/23/magazin/news/donovan.html|date=2001-11-23|accessdate=2007-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Release and reception ===
"Atlantis" served as the band's fourth single along with "[[When the Angels Sing]]", a [[midtempo]] [[ballad (music)|ballad]] from their debut album ''[[Elle'ments]]'' (2001). [[CD single|Physical CD single]]s of the [[double-A side|double-A single]] were released on November 19, 2001 by Cheyenne Records.&lt;ref name="discogs"/&gt; The [[maxi single]] includes the duet version, the Submarine Mix of "Atlantis" and three new remixes "When the Angels Sing".&lt;ref name="discogs"/&gt;

The '''Australia Council for the Arts''', informally known as the '''Australia Council''', is the official [[arts council]] or arts funding body of the [[Government of Australia]]

==Function==
The Australia Council (the Council) is the Australian Government’s principal arts funding and advisory body. The Council is the national advocate for the arts and its purpose is to champion and invest in Australian arts. This national leadership role is achieved by supporting and building Australia’s arts ecology by fostering excellence in the arts and increasing national and international engagement with Australian arts. 

== History ==
Australia Council was formed in 1967 by Prime Minister [[Harold Holt]] as a body for the public funding of the arts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=19 April 2013 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was given statutory authority in March 1975 by the ''Australia Council Act''. The Council's predecessor, the Australian Council for the Arts was established in 1968 by Prime Minister [[John Gorton]] as a division of the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet]]. The Council then incorporated other government projects, such as the [[Commonwealth Literary Fund]] and the [[Commonwealth Art Advisory Board]]. It operates in co-ordination with the various [[states and territories of Australia|state government]] agencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/about/our-structure/&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Council’s operations were independently reviewed in 2012, and the ''Australia Council Act 2013'' (the Act) commenced on 1 July 2013.

In early 2014 federal Ministers Brandis and Turnbull told artists at the Sydney Biennale that they were ungrateful and selfish to protest about the role of Transfield in Nauru. In December 2014, Arts Minister, [[George Brandis]], took away a large portion of literature funding from Australia Council.&lt;ref&gt;''The Conversation'', 16 October 2016, [http://theconversation.com/arts-training-is-an-essential-part-of-an-innovative-nation-67303 Arts training is an essential part of an innovative nation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NoMinister&gt;InDaily, 24 October 2016, [http://indaily.com.au/arts-and-culture/2016/10/24/no-minister-creative-arts-are-not-lifestyle-choice/ No minister, creative arts are not a "lifestyle choice"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, Brandis cut $26 million a year for four years from Australia Council arts funding, a third of its arts funding, receiving significant criticism from the arts community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/george-brandis-turns-arts-into-political-football-with-1047m-australia-council-cuts-20150513-gh0d0n.html|title=George Brandis turns arts into 'political football' with $104.7m Australia Council cuts|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-17/brandis-accused-of-neglecting-arts-politicising-funding/6629322|title=Private arts donors Neil Balnaves and Luca Belgiorno-Nettis accuse George Brandis of neglecting arts community, politicising funding|work=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money was reallocated to a new program, the '''National Program for Excellence in the Arts''' (NPEA). NPEA in turn was criticised by many artists and arts organisations for lacking the "arms-length" funding principles that had applied to the relationship between the government and Australia Council since its inception in the 1970s. These principles have traditionally had bipartisan support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/comment/the-regrettable-rise-of-the-arts-bureaucrat-20150518-gh4o01.html|title=The regrettable rise of the arts bureaucrat|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stuartglover"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/writers-and-publishers-are-all-at-sea-under-brandis-and-the-npea-44842|title=Writers and publishers are all at sea under Brandis and the NPEA|author=Stuart Glover|date=20 July 2015|work=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/the-australia-council-must-hold-firm-on-arms-length-funding-24460|title=The Australia Council must hold firm on ‘arm’s length’ funding|work=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandis was criticised previously for giving Melbourne classical music record label Melba Recordings a $275,000 grant outside of the usual funding and peer-assessment processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/04/australias-arts-funding-crisis-george-brandis-one-man-show|title=George Brandis and the arts funding crisis: one hell of a one-man show|author=Ben Eltham|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brandis's changes to funding arrangements, including the quarantining of the amount received by Australia's 28 major performing arts companies, were widely seen to disadvantage the small-to-medium arts sector and independent artists.&lt;ref name="stuartglover"/&gt; Following Malcolm Turnbull's successful [[Liberal Party of Australia leadership spill, September 2015|spill]] of the leadership of the Liberal party in September 2015, Brandis was replaced as arts minister by [[Mitch Fifield]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'', 20 September 2015, [http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/cabinet-reshuffle-artists-call-on-new-arts-minister-mitch-fifield-to-undo-the-damage-done-by-george-brandis-20150920-gjqvpk.html Cabinet reshuffle: artists call on new arts minister Mitch Fifield to 'undo the damage' done by George Brandis]&lt;/ref&gt; In November Fifield gave back $8 million a year for four years to Australia Council, changed the NPEA to the '''Catalyst Fund''', and stressed it would have a focus on smaller arts projects. The arts community was not impressed by the changes.&lt;ref&gt;''Sydney Morning Herald'', 20 November 2015, [http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/rebranding-brandis-arts-fund-catalyst-wont-kill-off-national-program-for-excellence-in-the-arts-20151120-gl42nv.html Rebranding Brandis arts fund Catalyst won't kill off National Program for Excellence in the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, 20 February, 2016, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-20/$105m-budget-cut-caught-australia-council-by-surprise:-emails/7185900?pfmredir=sm Australia Council budget cuts blindsided peak arts body's executive, documents show]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the reduced funding, Australia Council cancelled project funding rounds for small groups and individuals in 2015 and then cut funding to over 60 arts organisations across the country in May 2016. 

In addition, Education Minister [[Simon Birmingham]] indicated that the government is considering cutting funding to students who wish to undertake creative arts training, saying that he believes training in the creative arts is a ‘lifestyle’ choice and cannot lead to a satisfactory career or any economic outcome, and that he intends to cut loan support for students to undertake this form of education and training, cutting loans for over 50 arts training programs, including programs in ceramics, photography, dance, acting, animation, all forms of design, circus, music, film, fashion and journalism.&lt;ref name=NoMinister/&gt;

The '''Blue Bell''' is at 63–65 Northgate Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=images&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376358|desc= Number 63 and 65 street the Blue Bell, Chester|access-date= 8 April 2012 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally it consisted of two [[England in the Middle Ages|medieval]] houses which were joined together in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century.  The pavement runs through the ground floor storey of the northern part of the building, leaving a separate cabin or chamber between the pavement and the road. 

==History==
The building dates from the mid- to late 15th&amp;nbsp;century,&lt;ref name=images/&gt; and is said to be the oldest surviving intact [[Middle Ages|medieval]] house in Chester.&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{Citation | last = Morris| first = Richard| author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = |  year = 1993| title = The Buildings of Chester| edition = | volume = | series = | publication-place = Dover| place = | publisher = Alan Sutton|  page = 92| isbn = 0-7509-0255-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was originally two houses, which were joined in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century.  It formed part of Lorimer's Row, a group of buildings with an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] at ground level, as distinct from the [[Chester Rows|Rows]] in the centre of the city whose walkways are at the first floor level.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  From an early date, the south part of the building has been an [[Public_house#Inns|inn]], its first [[licence]] possibly dating from 1494. The separate cabin or chamber has been used for a number of functions; these include being a ticket office for [[Stagecoach|stage coach]] operators in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century and in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century a [[soda fountain]] bar and a [[barber]]'s shop.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;  In the 19th&amp;nbsp;century the southern part of the building was an inn while the northern part housed a shop.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;  The inn closed in the 1930s.  In 1948 the building was used as an [[antique]] shop but its condition deteriorated so much that it was threatened with demolition.  In the 1950s the Chester Civic Trust campaigned for its survival, it was restored, and has since been used as a clothes shop and, more recently, as a restaurant.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.virtualchester.org/view/view_location.php?id=36| title = Blue Bell Inn| accessdate = 15 August 2009| publisher = Chester City Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

The building is [[timber-framed]] on a [[sandstone]] [[plinth]] with brickwork added later which has subsequently been [[Stucco|rendered]] and painted.  The roofs are of grey [[slate]]s.  The two buildings comprising the whole have separate frames each with roofs leading to [[gable]]s over the street.  At ground level the southern part of the building has an [[Arcade (architecture)|arcade]] open to the street with a [[Pier (architecture)|pier]] to the south and an octagonal [[column]] south of the centre.  The northern part has a separate cabin or chamber adjacent to the street with the walkway between its rear and the rest of the building. On the street side of the chamber is a three-pane [[Cant (architecture)|canted]] [[oriel window]] and a door.  On the upper floor each part of the building has a horizontal window with a small one-paned window between them.&lt;ref name=images/&gt;

A '''Bradel''' binding (also called a bonnet or bristol board binding, a ''German Case'' binding, or in French as ''Cartonnage à la Bradel'' or ''en gist'') is a style of [[book binding]] with a hollow back. It most resembles a case binding in that it has a hollow back and visible joint, but unlike a case binding, it is built up on the book. Characteristic of the binding is the material covering the outside boards is separate from the material covering the spine. Many bookbinders consider the Bradel binding to be stronger than a case binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Laura|title=Bookbinding and Conservation by Hand: A Working Guide|year=1995|publisher=Oak Knoll Press|location=New Castle, DE|isbn=1-884718-11-6|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The binding may be traced to 18th century [[Germany]]. The originator of the binding is uncertain, but the name comes from a French binder working in Germany, Alexis-Pierre Bradel (also known as ''Bradel l'ainé'' or ''Bradel-Derome'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Matt|title=Bookbinding and the Conservation of Books|date=1982|publisher=Library of Congress|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0844403660|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The binding originally appeared as a temporary binding, but the results were durable, and the binding had great success in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cambras|first=Josep|title=The Complete Book of Bookbinding|year=2004|publisher=Lark Books|location=Asheville, NC|pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, it is most likely to be encountered in [[photo album]]s and [[scrapbooking|scrapbooks]].

The binding has the advantage of allowing the book to open fully, where traditional [[leather]] bindings are too rigid. It is sometimes modified to provide a rounded spine. This lends the appearance of a book where the paper is not suited to spine rounding; this is also to provide a rounded spine to a book too thin for a spine rounding to hold.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The binding may also provide an impressive-looking leather spine to a book without incurring the full expense of binding a book in full or partial leather.

[[Air Chief Marshal]] '''Sir Christopher Neil Foxley-Norris''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|GCB|DSO|OBE|FRSA}} (16 March 1917 – 28 September 2003) was a senior commander in the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). A squadron commander during the [[Second World War]], he later served as Commander-in-Chief [[Royal Air Force Germany|RAF Germany]] in the late 1960s.

==Early life==
Christopher Neil Foxley-Norris was born on 16 March 1917, a younger son of Major John Percivall Foxley-Norris (1886–1924) and his wife, Dorothy Brabant Smith. His paternal grandfather was the clergyman [[William Foxley Norris]], who served as [[Dean of Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U16298 |chapter=Foxley-Norris, Air Chief Marshal Sir Christopher (Neil) |title=Who Was Who |date=April 2014 |publisher=A &amp; C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc (online edition, Oxford University Press) |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. C. Fox-Davies. ''[[iarchive:armorialfamilies02foxd|Armorial Families]]''. 1929. pp. 1443–4&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Winchester College]] and then [[Trinity College, Oxford]] where he read Law.&lt;ref name=air&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rafweb.org/Biographies/Foxley-Norris.htm |title=Air Chief Marshal Sir Christopher Foxley-Norris |first=M. B. |last=Barrass |work=Air of Authority – A History of RAF Organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the Oxford [[University Air Squadron]] in 1936.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; Foxley-Norris was awarded a Harmsworth scholarship (worth £200) to read for the Bar.&lt;ref name=air/&gt;  However, the outbreak of war prevented him from taking his final exams.  The [[Bar Council]] requested the money back, but Foxley-Norris made an arrangement with them that he would leave it to them in his will.&lt;ref name=air/&gt;

== Second World War==

Foxley-Norris was commissioned in the [[Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve]] after graduating and was called up for active service in 1939.&lt;ref name=air/&gt;  He undertook initial flying training at [[No. 9 Flying Training School]] at [[RAF Hullavington]] and completed the training at No 1 School of Army Co-operation.  His first posting on completion of the training was to [[No. 13 Squadron RAF]] flying [[Westland Lysander|Lysanders]] in the [[Battle of France]].&lt;ref name=air/&gt;

Following the fall of France and the start of the [[Battle of Britain]], the need for Army Co-operation pilots was greatly reduced whilst that for fighter pilots was increased.  As such, Foxley-Norris was posted to [[No. 3 Squadron RAF|No. 3 Squadron]] flying [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] from [[RAF Turnhouse]].&lt;ref name=air/&gt;

He was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Order]] for his actions – published in the ''[[London Gazette]]'' on 29 May 1945:&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=37099 |supp=y |page=2713 |date=25 May 1945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''Air Ministry, 29th May, 1945.''

The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the following awards in recognition of gallantry and devotion to duty in the execution of air operations: —

''Distinguished Service Order.''

Acting Wing Commander Christopher Neil FOXLEY-NORRIS (70225), RAFVR, 143 Sqn.

This officer has a long and distinguished record of operational flying. He has completed numerous sorties on his third tour of duty during which period he has operated against a wide range of enemy targets. For several months this officer has commanded the squadron. During the period numerous attacks have been made against enemy targets. By his brilliant leadership, exceptional skill and determination, Wing Commander Foxley-Norris has contributed in good measure to the successes obtained.}}

== Post-war RAF career ==

After the war, Foxley-Norris became Station Commander at [[RAF Stradishall]] and then at [[RAF West Malling]].&lt;ref name=air/&gt; He undertook the Senior Officers' War Course at the Royal Naval College at Greenwich and a course at the Imperial Defence College (now the Royal College of Defence Studies) in Belgrave Square in 1961.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; He went on to be Director of Organisation at the [[Air Ministry]] in 1962, [[Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff]] in 1963 and Air Officer Commanding [[No. 224 Group RAF|No. 224 Group]] in 1964.&lt;ref name=air/&gt;

He was appointed Director-General of RAF Organisation at the newly unified [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; He was promoted to [[Air Marshal]] and took command of [[RAF Germany]] and of the [[RAF Second Tactical Air Force|2nd Tactical Air Force]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=air/&gt; Foxley-Norris was knighted in the [[1969 New Year Honours]].&lt;ref name=air/&gt; His final post, with the rank of [[Air Chief Marshal]], was Chief of Personnel and Logistics in 1971.&lt;ref name=air/&gt;  He retired from active service in 1974.&lt;ref name=air/&gt;

Foxley-Norris was one of the umpires for the 1974 [[Operation Sea Lion (wargame)|Sandhurst wargame]] on [[Operation Sea Lion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mr-home.staff.shef.ac.uk/hobbies/seelowe.txt |title=Operation Sea Lion |work=Wargamers Historical Resources |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UK pro-smoking lobby organisation [[FOREST]] was launched on 19 June 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |title=Puff power lobby |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QPtjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=W-YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4000,6711599 |date=20 June 1979 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Foxley-Norris as its chairman. Foxley-Norris retired as the organisation's public figurehead in 1989, and was replaced by [[Lord Harris of High Cross]].

==Family==
Foxley-Norris married Joan (née Lovell Hughes, now Lady Foxley-Norris) in 1948.  They had no children.  Joan served as a nurse during the war, and worked with injured pilots. Following his passing, she took his place at many Battle of Britain events which were held and was also a regular visitor to [[RAF Benson]].

His funeral took place at St Mary Devoted at [[Turville]], near [[Stokenchurch]], on 7 October 2003.  Memorial services were held at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 29 January 2004&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;{{cite book |first=Humphrey |last=Wynn |chapterurl=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/92560 |chapter=Norris, Sir Christopher Neil Foxley (1917–2003) |title=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] |edition=online |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=May 2007 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/92560 |subscription=yes |accessdate=16 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[St. Clement Danes|St. Clement Danes, the Central Church of the Royal Air Force]], London in April 2004.

The '''coat of arms of [[El Salvador]]''' has been in use in its current form since 15 September 1912.

== Features ==
[[File:Actualescudodsalvadoreño.png|thumb|]]
[[File:Salcoatitán, El Salvador - panoramio (9).jpg|thumb|250px|The five rowed volcanos in the coat of arms were inspired by the [[Cordillera de Apaneca]] volcanic range]]
The coat of arms of El Salvador has Medieval Gothic influences as well as geographical, biblical, and Native American Indigenous symbolic representations, all of which come together in a distinctive, stylized shield design. Its center consists of a bold golden [[amber (color)|amber]] [[triangle]] outline (symbolizing the three branches of the country's government - Executive, Legislative and Judiciary), in which a row of five mighty and proud green forested coned [[volcano]]es, depicting a tropical Jurassic landscape, rise out of the massive cobalt blue Pacific Ocean swells, symbolizing the fellowship of the five original isthmian member states of the [[United Provinces of Central America]]. The volcanoes are illuminated yellow on their right sides by sunshine. Above the volcanoes is a crimson red [[Phrygian cap]] on a staff before an amber sun with spiraling swirling rays, with a brilliant volcanic "[[red sky at morning]]" under the sun in the horizon. The date of the Independence Day of El Salvador, 15 September 1821, is written in black letters around the sun. On the top, there is a [[rainbow]] arch in an azure sky, a biblical symbol of peace. The colors in the rainbow from top to bottom are red, orange, yellow, green, and blue.

Behind the coat of arms there are five [[cobalt blue]] and white striped flags representing the flags of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]; one of those flags is risen straight up behind and over the triangle, hanging loosely around its spear, and the other four flags are risen half way and stretch out like wings from behind the triangle's sides, two on each side, one over another. The flags hang loosely on their sides, creating almost a horn-like effect with their ends tied up behind the triangle's bottom. 

All of the five flags are each held up and raised with Native American Indigenous wooden war spears, with obsidian Clovis [[projectile point]]s, and tied with feathers, symbolizing El Salvador's American Indigenous ancestry and heritage. The spears represent the spirit and heroism of the [[Lenca]] and [[Pipil people|Pipil]] warriors, who defeated the first attempted Spanish conquest of [[Cuzcatlan]]. Spanish conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]] wrote that he was awestruck and spooked in great fear when he saw the massive numbers of American Indigenous warriors with large spears and bows as their weaponry standing their ground in their battle against the invading Spaniards.

Under the triangle, there is a golden amber scroll which states the national motto of El Salvador: ''Dios, Unión, Libertad'' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: "God, Union, Liberty") in boldface black capital letters.

The triangle, flags, and scroll are surrounded by a green [[laurel wreath]] tied together with a cobalt blue and white striped ribbon representing the national flag, which symbolizes unity. The laurel wreath is divided into 14 different parts, which symbolize the 14 Departments, the Salvadoran subnational administrative units.  All this is surrounded by golden amber letters, which form the Spanish words ''REPÚBLICA DE EL SALVADOR EN LA AMÉRICA CENTRAL'' (English: Republic of El Salvador in Central America) in boldface capital letters. For special occasions, the whole entire coat of arms of El Salvador is stylized in amber gold color with a white or royal cobalt blue background. The coat of arms of El Salvador is also sometimes shown in silhouette.

The '''coat of arms of the University of Oxford''' depicts an open book with the inscription ''[[Dominus Illuminatio Mea|Dominus illuminatio mea]]'' ('The Lord is my light'), surrounded by three golden crowns.

A blazon of this would be:
{{cquote|''Azure, upon a book open proper, leathered Gules, garnished Or, having on the dexter side seven seals of the last, the words DOMINVS ILLVMINATIO MEA; all between three open crowns, two and one, Or.''&lt;ref&gt;University of Oxford. (2005.) ''Oxford University Calendar 2005–2006'', [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|0-19-928370-2}}. p. 1 features a blazon of the coat of the arms of the university.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The arms have been in existence since around 1400, varying in appearance over the centuries. The number of seals and the text, for example, have both varied. The modern version of the arms in which they are not borne on a shield, but rather surrounded by a garter bearing the text ''UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD'', was designed in 1993 and is a registered trademark.

'''Cutumay Camones''' was a band from [[El Salvador]], formed in 1982. Its stated objective was to recover Salvadorean cultural roots and to provide popular music for the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front|national liberation movement]].

In May 1982, Cutumay Camones was formed by a directive from the [[Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front#Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo (ERP)|People's Revolutionary Army of El Salvador]], a part of the [[FMLN]], as cultural ambassadors for the national liberation movement. The name comes from the [[Nahuatl]] for a town in [[Santa Ana Department|Santa Ana]] in western El Salvador, where the FMLN had an uprising in January 1981.

The group originally had three members: Eduardo, Gabino, and Ricardo, and two months later Paco, Teresa and Israel joined. By 1984, Lolo had joined, and eventually the group consisted of five permanent members: Lolo, Paco, Israel, Eduardo, and Teresa. Except for Eduardo, and Israel none of the members were musicians prior to joining. Cutumay Camones used different rhythms such as [[Mexican Son music|Son]] [[cumbia]] [[Classical guitar|classical]] and [[rancheras]], and instruments such as [[marimba]], [[accordion]], and [[Guitarrón mexicano|guitarrón]].

In 1988, the group officially disbanded.&lt;ref name=Noticias&gt;{{cite web|title=Cutumay Camones : Popular Insurgency And Music In El Salvador|author1=Almeida, Paul|author2=Urbizagastegui, Rubén|url=http://www.antropologia.com.ar/congresos/contenido/49CAI/Almeida.htm|publisher=Noticias de Antropología y Arqueología|accessdate=2 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514061304/http://www.antropologia.com.ar/congresos/contenido/49CAI/Almeida.htm|archivedate=14 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lolo left El Salvador in 1990 and later played in the band [[Los Jornaleros del Norte]].

In 2012, Teresa from Cutumay Camones joined with members of another revolutionary Salvadron music group from the 1980s, Guinama, to form a new group.  The fusion of these historic bands is called Cutumay Guinama.  Their mission is to keep alive the memories of the sacrifices made for liberty during the civil war, and to continue promoting social change with their new recordings.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Radio YSUCA on February 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Grant Rosen''' (26 November 1959 – 3 March 2014) was a South African [[fashion designer]] and [[art]]ist. Trained as a [[Painting|painter]], he is known primarily for his political fashion, art and activism, from his anti-[[apartheid]] designs in the 1980s to the Reason8 clothing label in the [[United States]].

==Education==
Born in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]], David Rosen was educated at [[Sea Point]] Boys High School. After graduating in 1976, he was conscripted for two years to the South African 6th Infantry Division. After one year, he was posted to Youngsfield Anti-Aircraft Base in Cape Town where he worked on the Battalion magazine as an illustrator. In 1980-81 he was a student at the Cape Technikon School of Art. In 1982-83 he was student at the School of Contemporary Art in Cape Town.

==Life and career==
In 1983, David Rosen formed his first fashion label called “Electric Affair” (for Momentum Clothing). He designed non-denim pants (“[[Parachute pants]]”), and sold across racial lines in a still very segregated market. He also designed his first “political” tee shirt: an anti-nuclear design highlighting the [[Koeberg Nuclear Power Station]], not far from where he lived. In 1984, he formed his own business, teaming up with Laurie Dreyer from Chelsea West and Bad Boys Clothing. The line was called “Affair of State”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason8.net/r8press/redstarmenwom85.jpg  "Dubbelsoorte" Sarie Marais, March 27, 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason8.net/r8press/elegantinformality.jpg  "Elegant Informality" The Buyer, August 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason8.net/r8press/aos1985.jpg "Manstyl Somer '85" Sarie Marais, August 28, 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason8.net/r8press/thebuyermarch86.jpg "David Rosen Eclectic Inspiration" The Buyer, March 1986]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason8.net/r8press/cosmo1985menwom.jpg Cosmopolitan (South Africa), November 1985]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985 his “LET'S SHARE” tee shirt was banned by the [[apartheid]] government and after it appeared on the front page of The Cape Times newspaper,&lt;ref&gt;January 30th 1985, [[Cape Times]] headline "Ban on Visual Protest" ([http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article294526.ece/The-bold-brush-strokes-of-artistic-rebellion]).&lt;/ref&gt; the security police confiscated anything with his label and the tag-line: “clothes for people by david”.

Frustrated by the politics and general creative environment, David moved to [[New York city]]. In 1986, along with partner Danny Forman (Forecaster of Boston) he formed “Affair of State NYC” designing Better Junior and Contemporary collections. From 1986 to the beginning of the 1990s David made his name in New York city, selling to major specialty and department stores like [[Bloomingdales]], [[Macy's]] and [[Patricia Field]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason8.net/r8press/wearitwithmeaning.jpg "Wear it With Meaning" by Aimee Lee Ball.

In the early 2000s, David moved to [[Boston]]. Shortly after, in 2003, David created the Reason8 label as a fashion-driven response to the [[invasion of iraq]] and various political and ideological drifts following the presidency of [[George W. Bush]]. Reason8 shirts combined strong graphic design with thought-provoking messages on a range of political and social topics. David designed the "WMD: Weapons of Mass Deception"  shirt in reaction to the controversy around [[Iraq's weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref&gt;''Style &amp;Substance: Put On Your Party Shirt - Designers, Rappers, PACs Clamor for Political T-Shirts'', by Amy Chozick, 23 July 2004, The Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt; His "I do, I do, I do" became popularly associated with the debate on [[same-sex marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;"Gays have suitors in wedding industry firms hope to cash in as legal vows begin", 15 May 2004, The Boston Globe [https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/638132431.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=May+15%2C+2004]&lt;/ref&gt; He also addressed the controversy around the increasing [[surveillance]] with the design "One Nation Under Surveillance".&lt;ref&gt;"Fashionable Dissent" by Camille Dodero.

In 2008, David was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] and struggled through therapy for some time. While in treatment at [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]] he began recording a visual diary of the experience including doing paint-studies of the Infusion Rooms. This became the basis for his first solo exhibition "Hotel Chemo", a collection of paintings and writings.&lt;ref name="art2"&gt;"David Rosen: Art as Therapy, Healing, Protest", Jim Sullivan, Boston Herald, 3 February 2010 [http://www.jimsullivanink.com/content/view/1679/51/]&lt;/ref&gt; Cancer radically changed his artistic outlook.&lt;ref name="art2"/&gt; From 2008 up to the time of his death in 2014, he only issued limited editions shirts and his main focus shifted toward [[process art]] through his painting, illustration, sculpture and multi-media projects. In particular, he focused on [[surrealist automatism]] as healing tool.&lt;ref name="art2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Rosen's webpage [http://www.davidgrantrosen.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623210138/http://davidgrantrosen.com/ |date=2013-06-23 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his final years, he is bent on capturing specific moments in the creation of a painting, moments when he pauses and just for that second, the painting is complete. He used resin to preserve these moments, which he called "skins".&lt;ref&gt;"A Somerville artist dies without fading away", Monica Jimenez, Wicked Local, 21 March 2014 [http://somerville.wickedlocal.com/article/20140321/NEWS/140329011/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yasushi Akutagawa]]'s '''''Ellora Symphony''''' was composed in 1958 after a visit to the [[Ellora Caves]] in [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]], [[India]]. One of several [[Japan]]ese [[Primitivism|primitivistic]] [[Symphony|symphonies]] composed in the 1950s, including [[Akira Ifukube]]'s [[Sinfonia Tapkaara]] and [[Kan Ishii]]'s [[Sinfonia Ainu]], it is representative of Akutagawa's most adventurous period, when he associated [[Toru Takemitsu]] and [[Toshiro Mayuzumi]] and embraced [[avant-garde music]].

Instead of the traditional multi-movement layout, which Akutagawa had used in his [[Shostakovich]]ian [[Symphony No. 1 (Akutagawa)|Prima Sinfonia]] three years earlier, the Ellora Symphony is structured in fifteen sequences: eight caressing "feminine" fragments marked [[Tempo|Adagio]] or [[Andante (tempo)|Andante]] and seven aggressive "masculine" ones marked [[Tempo|Allegro]]. The later assemble mainly in the last half of the work, translating in an Introduction and Allegro-like form.

'''Frank Raymond''' "'''F. R.'''" '''Leavis''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CH}} (14 July 1895 – 14 April 1978) was a British [[literary critic]] of the early-to-mid-twentieth century. He taught for much of his career at [[Downing College, Cambridge]], and later at the [[University of York]].

==Early life==
Frank Raymond Leavis was born in [[Cambridge]] in 1895, about a decade after [[T. S. Eliot]], [[James Joyce]], [[D. H. Lawrence]] and [[Ezra Pound]], literary figures whose reputations he would later contribute to enhancing. His father, Harry Leavis, a cultured man, ran a shop in Cambridge which sold pianos and other musical instruments, {{sfn|Hayman|1976|p=1}} and his son was to retain a respect for him throughout his life. Leavis was educated at a fee-paying independent school (in English terms a [[Independent school|minor public school]]), [[The Perse School]], whose headmaster was Dr. [[W. H. D. Rouse]]. Rouse was a classicist and known for his "direct method", a practice which required teachers to carry on classroom conversations with their pupils in Latin and classical Greek. Though he had some fluency in foreign languages, Leavis felt that his native language was the only one on which he was able to speak with authority. His extensive reading in the classical languages is not therefore strongly evident in his critical publications.{{sfn|Bell|1988|p=3}}

Leavis had won a scholarship from the Perse School to [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] to read History. Britain declared war on Germany soon after he matriculated, when he was nineteen. Leavis left Cambridge after his first year as an undergraduate and joined the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]] (FAU) at [[York]] in 1915. After the introduction of [[conscription]] in 1916, when his brother Ralph also joined the FAU &lt;ref&gt;List of Members of the Friends' Ambulance Unit 1914-1919, London, 1919, Friends' House Library, London&lt;/ref&gt;, he benefited from the blanket recognition of the members of the Friends' Ambulance Unit as [[conscientious objectors]]. Leavis is quoted as saying: "But after the Bloody Somme there could be no question for anyone who knew what modern war was like of joining the army."{{sfn|MacKillop|1997|p=19}}

He worked in France behind the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], carrying a copy of [[John Milton|Milton]]'s poems with him. His wartime experiences had a lasting effect on him, making him prone to insomnia. He maintained that exposure to [[poison gas]] retained in the clothes of soldiers who had been gassed damaged his physical health, particularly his digestion.{{sfn|MacKillop|1997|pp=}}{{Pages needed|date=December 2016}}

Leavis was slow to recover from the war, and he was later to refer to it as "the great hiatus". He said: "The war, to put it egotistically, was bad luck for us."{{sfn|MacKillop|1997|p=225}}

On his return from the war in 1919 Leavis changed his field of study to English and became a pupil in the newly founded English School at Cambridge. Despite graduating with [[first-class honours]], Leavis was not seen as a strong candidate for a research fellowship and instead embarked on a PhD, then an unusual career move for an aspiring academic. In 1924, Leavis presented a thesis on ''The Relationship of Journalism to Literature'', which "studied the rise and earlier development of the press in England".{{sfn|Bell|1988|p=4}} This work contributed to his lifelong concern with the way in which the ethos of a periodical can both reflect and mould the cultural aspirations of a wider public.{{sfn|Greenwood|1978|p=8}} In 1927, Leavis was appointed as a probationary lecturer for the university, and, when his first substantial publications began to appear a few years later, their style was very much influenced by the demands of teaching.

==Later life and career==
In 1929 Leavis married one of his students, [[Q. D. Leavis|Queenie Roth]], and this union resulted in a productive collaboration which yielded many major critical works. 1932 was an 'annus mirabilis' for them, when Leavis published ''New Bearings in English Poetry'', his wife published ''Fiction and the Reading Public'', and the quarterly periodical ''[[Scrutiny (journal)|Scrutiny]]'' was founded.{{sfn|Greenwood|1978|p=9}} A small publishing house, [[The Minority Press]], was founded by Gordon Fraser, another of Leavis' students, in 1930, and served for several years as an additional outlet for the work of Leavis and some of his students.  In 1931 Leavis was appointed director of studies in English at [[Downing College]] where he was to teach for the next thirty years. He soon founded ''Scrutiny'', the critical quarterly that he edited until 1953, using it as a vehicle for the new Cambridge criticism, upholding rigorous intellectual standards and attacking the dilettante elitism he believed to characterise the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. ''Scrutiny'' provided a forum for (on occasion) identifying important contemporary work and (more commonly) reviewing the traditional canon by serious criteria.{{sfn|Bell|1988|p=6}} This criticism was informed by a teacher's concern to present the essential to students, taking into consideration time constraints and a limited range of experience.

''New Bearings in English Poetry'' was the first major volume of criticism Leavis was to publish, and it provides insight into his own critical positions. He has been frequently (but often erroneously) associated with the American school of [[New Criticism|New Critics]], a group which advocated close reading and detailed textual analysis of poetry over, or even instead of, an interest in the mind and personality of the poet, sources, the history of ideas and political and social implications. Although there are undoubtedly similarities between Leavis's approach to criticism and that of the New Critics (most particularly in that both take the work of art itself as the primary focus of critical discussion), Leavis is ultimately distinguishable from them, since he never adopted (and was explicitly hostile to) a theory of the poem as a self-contained and self-sufficient aesthetic and formal artifact, isolated from the society, culture and tradition from which it emerged. ''New Bearings'', devoted principally to [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], [[William Butler Yeats]], [[T. S. Eliot]], and [[Ezra Pound]], was an attempt to identify the essential new achievements in modern poetry.{{sfn|Bell|1988|p=6}} It also discussed at length and praised the work of [[Ronald Bottrall]], whose importance was not to be confirmed by readers and critics.

In 1933 Leavis published ''For Continuity'', which was a selection of ''Scrutiny'' essays. This publication, along with ''Culture and the Environment'' (a joint effort with Denys Thompson), stressed the importance of an informed and discriminating, highly trained intellectual elite whose existence within university English departments would help preserve the cultural continuity of English life and literature. In ''Education and the University'' (1943), Leavis argued that ‘there is a prior cultural achievement of language; language is not a detachable instrument of thought and communication. It is the historical embodiment of its community’s assumptions and aspirations at levels which are so subliminal much of the time that language is their only index'.{{sfn|Bell|1988|p=9}}

Leavis is sometimes seen as having contributed to the [[mythos]] of [[Merry England|Merrie England]] with his notion of the ''organic community'', by which he seems to have meant a community with a deeply rooted and locally self-sufficient culture that he claimed to have existed in the villages of 17th and 18th century England and which was destroyed by the machine and mass culture introduced by the [[industrial revolution]]. Historians of the era have suggested that the idea was based on a misreading of history and that such communities had never existed.{{sfn|Bilan|1979|pp=14-18}} No historians of [[Early Modern Britain]] have supported the notion of the organic community.

In 1948, Leavis focused his attention on fiction and made his general statement about the English novel in ''[[The Great Tradition]]'' where he traced this claimed tradition through [[Jane Austen]], [[George Eliot]], [[Henry James]], and [[Joseph Conrad]]. Contentiously, Leavis, and his followers, excluded major authors such as [[Charles Dickens]], [[Laurence Sterne]] and [[Thomas Hardy]] from his canon, characterising Dickens as a ''mere entertainer'', but eventually, following the revaluation of Dickens by [[Edmund Wilson]] and [[George Orwell]], Leavis changed his position, publishing ''Dickens the Novelist'' in 1970. The Leavisites' downgrading of Hardy may have damaged Leavis's own authority.

In 1950, in the introduction to ''Mill on Bentham and Coleridge'', a publication he edited, Leavis set out the historical importance of utilitarian thought. Leavis found Bentham to epitomize the scientific drift of culture and social thinking, which was in his view the enemy of the holistic, humane understanding he championed.{{sfn|Bell|1988|p=9}}

''The Common Pursuit'', another collection of his essays from ''Scrutiny'', was published in 1952. Outside his work on English poetry and the novel, this is Leavis’s best-known and most influential work. A decade later Leavis was to earn much notoriety when he delivered his Richmond lecture, ''Two Cultures? The Significance of C. P. Snow'' at Downing College.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhardi, William (1962). [http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/16th-march-1962/9/sir-charles-snow-dr-f-r-leavis-and-the-two "Sir Charles Snow, Dr. F. R. Leavis and the Two Cultures,"] ''The Spectator'', 16 March, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Leavis vigorously attacked Snow's suggestion, from a 1959 lecture and book by [[C. P. Snow]] (see ''[[The Two Cultures]]''), that practitioners of the scientific and humanistic disciplines should have some significant understanding of each other, and that a lack of knowledge of twentieth-century physics was comparable to an ignorance of [[Shakespeare]].&lt;ref&gt;Ortolano, Guy (2009). ''The Two Cultures Controversy: Science, Literature and Cultural Politics in Postwar Britain'', Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Leavis's ''ad hominem'' attacks on Snow's intelligence and abilities were widely decried in the British press by public figures such as [[Lord Boothby]] and [[Lionel Trilling]].&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Roger (1994). [http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/-The-Two-Cultures--today-4882 "'The Two Cultures' Today: On the C. P. Snow–F. R. Leavis Controversy"], ''The New Criterion'', Vol. 12, No. 6, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leavis introduced the idea of the ''third realm'' as a name for the method of existence of literature; works which are not private like a dream or public in the sense of something that can be tripped over, but exist in human minds as a work of collaborative re-constitution.{{sfn|Greenwood|1978|p=11}} The notion of the ''third realm'' has not received much attention subsequently. 

In 1964 he resigned his fellowship at Downing; however, he took up visiting professorships at the [[University of Bristol]], the [[University of Wales]] and the [[University of York]]. His final volumes of criticism were ''Nor Shall My Sword'' (1972), ''The Living Principle'' (1975) and ''Thought, Words and Creativity'' (1976). These later works are notable for their more discursive treatment of the issues he had debated with [[René Wellek]] in the 1930s.

Leavis died in 1978, at the age of 82,&lt;ref&gt;Ezard, John (1978). [https://www.theguardian.com/books/1978/apr/18/classics.johnezard "Obituary: Frank Raymond Leavis,"] ''The Guardian'', 18 April.&lt;/ref&gt; having been made a [[Companion of Honour]] in the previous [[New Year Honours]]. His wife, Queenie D. Leavis, died in 1981. He features as a main character, played by Sir [[Ian Holm]], in the 1991 [[BBC]] [[TV]] feature, [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102276/ ''The Last Romantics'']. The story focuses on his relationship with his mentor, Sir [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]] and the students. More recently, in a revival of interest in his work, he has been the subject of a series of  conferences at the University of York and at Downing College, Cambridge.

==Character and reputation==
As Leavis continued his career he became increasingly dogmatic, belligerent and paranoid,&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=12217&amp;R=EC6821 |title=Preview: Dr. Leavis, I Presume? |accessdate=2008-09-13 |author=Brooke Allen |date=22 June 2006 |work=[[The Weekly Standard]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080525132631/http://www.weeklystandard.com/Utilities/printer_preview.asp?idArticle=12217&amp;R=EC6821 |archivedate=25 May 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Martin Seymour-Smith]] found him (and his disciples) to be ''fanatic and rancid in manner''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Seymour-Smith Guide to Modern World Literature (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1975) vol. 1, pages. 291-2&lt;/ref&gt; Leavis' conduct led to a breach with [[T S Eliot]] who wrote

{{Quote|I so strongly disagreed with Dr Leavis during the last days of ''[[Scrutiny (journal)|Scrutiny]]'', and objected to his attacks and innuendoes about people I knew and respected. I think it is a pity he became so intemperate in his views and was extravagant in his admirations, as I had, in the earlier stages of the magazine, felt great sympathy for its editor.&lt;ref name="Allen" /&gt;}}

Leavis' uncompromising zeal in promoting his views of literature drew mockery from quarters of the literary world involved in imaginative writing. In a letter that [[Edith Sitwell]] wrote to [[Pamela Hansford Johnson]] in 1959 she described Leavis as ''a tiresome, whining, pettyfogging little pipsqueak''.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Pollard ''Pamela Hansford Johnson: Her Life, Work and Times'' (Shepeard-Walwyn, UK, 2014) {{ISBN|978-0-85683-298-7}}. page 280.&lt;/ref&gt; Leavis (as ''Simon Lacerous'') and Scrutiny (as ''Thumbscrew'') were satirized by [[Frederick Crews]] in the chapter ''Another Book to Cross off your List'' of his lampoon of literary criticism theory ''The Pooh Perplex A Student Casebook''. In her novel ''[[Possession (Byatt novel)|Possession]]'', [[A. S. Byatt]] (who was herself taught by Leavis) wrote of one of her characters (Blackadder) ''Leavis did to Blackadder what he did to serious students: he showed him the terrible, the magnificent importance and urgency of English literature and simultaneously deprived him of any confidence in his own capacity to contribute to or change it.'' [[Tom Sharpe]], in his novel ''The Great Pursuit'', depicts a ludicrous series of events ending in the hero teaching Leavisite criticism as a religion in the American Bible Belt. Leavis also appears as "Looseleaf" in [[Clive James]]'s ''Peregrine Prykke''. In his autobiography [[The Fry Chronicles]], [[Stephen Fry]] described Leavis as a ''sanctimonious prick of only parochial significance'' and said that Leavis had an ''intense suspicious propensity to explode in wrath and anathematize anyone who dared disagree with him''. Fry notes:

{{Quote|by the time I arrived in Cambridge his influence had waned, and he and his kind had been almost entirely eclipsed... Stories of Frank Leavis and his harridan of a wife Queenie snubbing, ostracising, casting out and calumniating anyone who offended them went the round, and those English academics at the university who had been in their orbit were callously dismissed by the elite as dead Leavisites.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Fry ''The Fry Chronicles: An Autobiography'' (Penguin, London, 2011) page 46, ISBN 978-0 -141-03980-0&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''The Rise and Fall of the English Man of Letters'' (1969), [[John Gross]] wrote of Leavis's "faintly comic air of having triumphantly demonstrated what has merely been strenuously asserted".

==Criticism==
Leavis' proponents claimed that he introduced a "seriousness" into English studies, and some English and American university departments were shaped very much by Leavis’s example and ideas. Leavis appeared to possess a very clear idea of literary criticism and he was well known for his decisive and often provocative, and idiosyncratic, judgements. Leavis insisted that valuation was the principal concern of criticism, and that it must ensure that English literature should be a living reality operating as an informing spirit in society, and that criticism should involve the shaping of contemporary sensibility.{{sfn|Bilan|1979|p=61}}

Leavis's criticism is difficult to directly classify, but it can be grouped into four chronological stages. The first is that of his early publications and essays including ''New Bearings in English Poetry'' (1932) and ''Revaluation'' (1936). Here he was concerned primarily with reexamining poetry from the seventeenth to twentieth centuries, and this was accomplished under the strong influence of T. S. Eliot. Also during this early period Leavis sketched out his views about university education.

He then turned his attention to fiction and the novel, producing ''The Great Tradition'' (1948) and ''D. H. Lawrence, Novelist'' (1955). Following this period Leavis pursued an increasingly complex treatment of literary, educational and social issues. Though the hub of his work remained literature, his perspective for commentary was noticeably broadening, and this was most visible in ''Nor Shall my Sword'' (1972).

Two of his last publications embodied the critical sentiments of his final years; ''The Living Principle: ‘English’ as a Discipline of Thought'' (1975), and ''Thought, Words and Creativity: Art and Thought in Lawrence'' (1976). Although these later works have been sometimes called "philosophy", it has been argued that there is no abstract or theoretical context to justify such a description. In discussing the nature of language and value, Leavis implicitly treats the sceptical questioning that philosophical reflection starts from as an irrelevance from his standpoint as a literary critic - a position set out in his famous early exchange with René Wellek (reprinted in 'The Common Pursuit'). 

===On poetry===
Though his achievements as a critic of fiction were impressive, Leavis is often viewed as having been a better critic of poetry than of the novel.&lt;ref&gt;"I now see that he is at his best as a critic of poetry"--Howard Jacobson. See his article, "Howard Jacobson on being taught by F.R. Leavis," The Telegraph, 23 April 2011. Accessed online: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/8466388/Howard-Jacobson-on-being-taught-by-FRLeavis.html&lt;/ref&gt; In ''New Bearings in English Poetry'' Leavis attacked the Victorian poetical ideal, suggesting that nineteenth-century poetry sought the consciously ‘poetical’ and showed a separation of thought and feeling and a divorce from the real world. The influence of T. S. Eliot is easily identifiable in his criticism of Victorian poetry, and Leavis acknowledged this, saying in ''The Common Pursuit'' that, "It was Mr. Eliot who made us fully conscious of the weakness of that tradition" .{{sfn|Leavis|1952|p=31}} In his later publication ''Revaluation'', the dependence on Eliot was still very much present, but Leavis demonstrated an individual critical sense operating in such a way as to place him among the distinguished modern critics.

The early reception of [[T. S. Eliot]] and Ezra Pound's poetry, and also the reading of [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], were considerably enhanced by Leavis's proclamation of their greatness. His criticism of [[John Milton]], on the other hand, had no great impact on Milton's popular esteem. Many of his finest analyses of poems were reprinted in the late work, ''The Living Principle''.

===On the novel===
As a critic of the novel, Leavis’s main tenet stated that great novelists show an intense moral interest in life, and that this moral interest determines the nature of their form in fiction.{{sfn|Bilan|1979|p=115}} Authors within this "tradition" were all characterised by a serious or responsible attitude to the moral complexity of life and included [[Jane Austen]], [[George Eliot]], [[Henry James]], [[Joseph Conrad]], and [[D. H. Lawrence]], but excluded [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[Charles Dickens]]. In ''The Great Tradition'' Leavis attempted to set out his conception of the proper relation between form/composition and moral interest/art and life. This proved to be a contentious issue in the critical world, as Leavis refused to separate art from life, or the aesthetic or formal from the moral. He insisted that the great novelist’s preoccupation with form was a matter of responsibility towards a rich moral interest, and that works of art with a limited formal concern would always be of lesser quality.

===On the BBC===
Leavis was one of the earliest detractors of the [[BBC]]. He accused the Corporation's coverage of English literature of lacking impartiality, and of vulgarising the literary taste of British society.&lt;ref name="ch"&gt;
Christopher Hilliard, ''English as a Vocation: The 'Scrutiny' Movement''.
Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2012 {{ISBN|0199695172}}. (p. 96)&lt;/ref&gt; In
1931, Leavis took issue with a BBC series of book discussions presented by
[[Harold Nicolson]], claiming that Nicolson's programmes lacked the "sensitiveness of intelligence" which Leavis believed good literary criticism required.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Avery, ''Radio Modernism: Literature, Ethics, and the BBC, 1922-1938''. Farnham Ashgate Publishing, 2006 {{ISBN|0754655172}} (p. 39-40)&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his career, Leavis constantly took issue with the BBC's motives and actions, even once jokingly referring to his "anti-BBC complex".&lt;ref name="ch"/&gt;

A '''figure painting''' is a work of [[fine art]] in any of the [[Painting#Painting media|painting media]] with the primary subject being the human figure, whether clothed or [[Nude (art)|nude]].
Figure painting may also refer to the activity of creating such a work. The human figure has been one of the constant subjects of art since the first stone age cave paintings, and has been reinterpreted in various styles throughout history.
==Depicting figures==
Unlike [[figure drawing]]s which are usually nudes, figure paintings are often [[historical]], [[mythological]], [[allegorical]] or [[Imagination|imaginary]] depictions that may have figures in appropriate costumes. A [[portrait painting]] is a figure painting that focuses on the creation of a likeness of a particular individual or group.

The nude has been a theme in [[Western art]] since [[classical antiquity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in Western Art and its Beginnings in Antiquity,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nuba/hd_nuba.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in the [[Renaissance]], after being largely absent during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Sorabella, Jean|title=The Nude in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance,  In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History| location=New York| publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art| url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/numr/hd_numr.htm|date=January 2008|accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- {{quotebox|source=Willem de Kooning|quote=Flesh is the reason oil paint was invented}} --&gt;
Oil paint historically has been the ideal media for depicting the figure. By blending and layering paint, the surface can become more like skin. "Its slow drying time and various degrees of viscosity enable the artist to achieve rich and subtle blends of color and texture, which can suggest transformations from one human substance to another."&lt;ref&gt;Scala, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Although working from [[Model (art)|live models]] is preferred, the length of time needed to complete a painting has led most modern painters to use photographs as references at least part of the time if not for the entire work.

Figure painting is not synonymous with [[figurative art]], which may depict real objects of any kind (including humans and animals).

A '''floating timeline''' (also known as a '''sliding timescale''') is a device used in [[fiction]], particularly in [[comics]] and [[animation]], to explain why characters [[Ageless|age little or not at all over a period of time]] — despite real-world markers like notable events, people and technology appearing in the works and correlating with the real world. A floating timeline is a subtle form of [[retroactive continuity]]. This is seen most clearly in the case of comic book characters who debuted as teens in the 1940s or the 1960s but who are still relatively young in current comics. Events from the characters' pasts are alluded to, but they are changed from having taken place years ago to having taken place more recently.

==Overview==
For an example taken from television animation, in ''[[The Simpsons]]'', episode "[[I Married Marge]]", which was broadcast in 1991, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] are shown in flashback to have conceived their son [[Bart Simpsons|Bart]] in 1980, after watching ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' in the cinema. In an episode that was broadcast in 2008, "[[That '90s Show]]", however, another flashback shows Homer and Marge in an earlier stage of their relationship, but sets those scenes in the mid- to late- 1990s. In both sets of present-day scenes, the characters are shown to be the same age—for example, Bart is still 10 years old in 1991 and 2008.

For comic book examples, any dates given within the comic are not relative to the publishing date of the comic (i.e. "10 years ago" means ten years before the reader read the story). This device enables publishing companies to continue to use their characters for as long as they wish without changing them significantly.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

A floating timeline is usually abstracted from that of actual historical events, but may contain subtle references to the real world timelines. There may also be attempts made to maintain certain characters' historic timelines if it is felt to be essential to the character's personality, while allowing the rest of the world's timelines to continue to develop. For example, in the 2000s comic book miniseries ''[[The Punisher (2000 series)|The Punisher]]'' and [[The Punisher (2001 series)|its subsequent continuation]], the title character is shown to be a [[Vietnam War]] veteran, just as he was in his earliest appearances in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comics of the 1970s. However, the stories place him in contemporary New York, where he meets fellow Marvel characters such as [[Spider-Man]], who is barely much older than he was when introduced in 1962.{{fact|date=September 2015}} 

An example taken from novels is the case of mystery writer [[Rex Stout]], who created a floating timeline for master detective [[Nero Wolfe]] and other principal characters in the corpus, while the stories take place contemporaneously with their writing and depict a changing landscape and society. Nero Wolfe's age is 56. "Those stories have ignored time for thirty-nine years," Stout told his authorized biographer John McAleer. "Any reader who can't or won't do the same should skip them. I didn't age the characters because I didn't want to. That would have made it cumbersome and would seem to have centered attention on the characters rather than the stories."&lt;ref&gt;McAleer, John, ''Rex Stout: A Biography'' (1977, Little, Brown and Company; {{ISBN|0-316-55340-9}}), p. 383; and McAleer, John, ''Royal Decree'' (1983, Pontes Press, Ashton, Maryland), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; In the early novels, Wolfe dated himself somewhat by discussing his life before [[World War I]] and his combat service in that war, but in later stories he was less explicit about his past.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Company Carpi==
Company Carpi is the name of the dance theatre company established by Bettina Carpi and Gary Lloyd.  The company aim is to produce works which "combines music &amp; dance with other art forms to present imaginative live performance pieces which address societal topics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.https://www.companycarpi.com/about}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Company Carpi's first fully funded (by Arts Council England and other sources) production was ''The Mirror Of Love'' based on the prose-poem by [[Alan Moore]] which was first performed in 2017.  The company followed this in 2018 with ''Knots'' based on the book by revolutionary psychiatrist R.D. Laing.
==Works in progress==
Lloyd is currently working with Bettina Carpi on a dance theatre adaptation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mary-talbot.co.uk/dancetheatre-adaptation-of-dotter-of-her-fathers-eyes/|title=Dance/theatre adaptation of Dotter of her Father's Eyes|work=Mary Talbot's Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Mary M. Talbot|Mary Talbot]] and [[Bryan Talbot]]'s [[Costa Award]]-winning graphic novel '[[Dotter of her Father's Eyes]]'.  Lloyd, Carpi, the Talbots, and dancer Christopher Owen presented work in progress at the Huddersfield Literature Festival 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litfest.org.uk/?q=diary#Storytelling%20&amp;%20Adaptation|title=Huddersfield Literature Festival 2015|publisher=Litfest.org|accessdate=2 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510155318/http://www.litfest.org.uk/?q=diary#Storytelling%20&amp;%20Adaptation |archivedate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual form of the production will be opera with dance.

[[File:Merry brothers 1887.jpg|thumb|right|350px|[[Uroš Predić]], ''Happy Brothers'', 1887, oil on canvas, {{convert|82|by|122|cm}}, [[National Museum of Serbia]]|alt=Four men walking through a village in an intoxicated state]]
'''''Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother!'''''{{efn|{{lang-sr-Latn|Vesela braća, žalosna im majka!}} {{lang-sr-Cyrl|Весела браћа, жалосна им мајка!}}}} (often referred to simply as '''''Happy Brothers'''''){{efn|{{lang-sr-Latn|Vesela braća}}, {{lang-sr-Cyrl|Весела браћа}}}} is an 1887 [[oil painting]] by the Serbian artist [[Uroš Predić]]. It shows four intoxicated youths walking through their village whilst the mother of one shouts her disapproval from the distance. The painting is said to have been inspired by a frequent sight in Predić's home village of [[Orlovat]]—that of drunken youths returning from the pub at dawn. Predić painted the composition hoping it would persuade the villagers to change their ways. He was disappointed that it not only failed to decrease the incidence of drunkenness in Orlovat, but was well received by the villagers themselves, who were happy merely to have been depicted.

One [[art history|art historian]] suggests the painting was influenced by the works of [[Rosa Bonheur]] and [[Gustave Courbet]], while another believes it was informed by those of the satirists [[William Hogarth]] and [[Honoré Daumier]]. The painting's humorous content contributed to its popularity among critics, collectors and the public at large, which led to Predić painting two replicas in 1918 and 1922. By 1890, the original was owned by the [[National Museum of Serbia]], in whose possession it remains.

==Background==
[[Uroš Predić]] (1857–1953) was one of the most successful 19th- and 20th-century Serbian [[Realism (arts)|realists]].{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=31}} A native of [[Orlovat]], a village in the [[Banat]] region of [[Austria-Hungary]], Predić drew scenes of life in the village throughout his career.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=35}} One of the more frequent sights during his stays there was of intoxicated young men returning from the pub at dawn and waking up the whole village.&lt;ref name="Pivnica"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Pivnica.net|title=Vesela braća, žalosna im majka|trans-title=Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother!|language=Croatian|url=http://www.pivnica.net/vesela-braca-zalosna-im-majka/2126/|date=17 July 2012|accessdate=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In painting the composition, Predić was not only attempting to realistically depict contemporary village life but also to convey a message. "I observed this every day", he explained. "I said to myself there must be some way of telling these people to what an unhappy level they have descended and have a moral impact on them, capturing all the bad habits of my compatriots."{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=35}} Predić had expressed disapproval of the villagers' behavior in an earlier work, ''Clients in Front of a Lawyer's Door'' (1886).{{sfn|Jovanović|2009|p=89}}

==Painting==
===Description===
''Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother!'', often referred to simply as ''Happy Brothers'', is an [[oil painting]] that measures {{convert|82|by|122|cm}}.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=36}} "It is a glimpse into village life in early fall", Predić explained. "The harvest has been gathered and the pigs slaughtered. The fires have been lit, the spits turned, the drinks dispensed and the celebrations fully under way. The air is filled with the aroma of&amp;nbsp;... cooking meat&amp;nbsp;... and the sounds of music and drunken song that disturb the village's peace."{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=35}}

[[File:Uroš Predić 1982 Yugoslavia stamp.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Predić's self-portrait on a 1982 Yugoslav postage stamp]]

According to Predić, the painting shows four intoxicated youths who have been drinking all night walking rowdily through their village around dawn and waking all their neighbours. They trudge down the middle of the [[dirt road]], keeping their distance from the surrounding houses so as to avoid crashing against a wall and hurting themselves. The ''[[gaida|gajda]]'' (bagpipe) player, the most sober of the four, walks slightly ahead of his friends. The one to the left, the youngest of the group, walks barefoot through the mud and props one of his friends up against his shoulder. The man he is propping up, who is the most intoxicated, paid for the previous night's drinks and bounces between shoulders for support. The man to his right has just realized that he is walking by his own dilapidated home. His mother, alerted by the young men's laughter and song, emerges from the house and recognizes her son.{{efn|Filipovitch-Robinson writes that the woman is the mother of all four.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2007|pp=131–132}}}} She begins to shout at him and threatens to spank him once he returns, but the young man simply laughs and sends her an acknowledging wave with his hat. A young girl peaks out the bottom pane of the left window of the house to the far right, wondering if her boyfriend is part of the group. A sign above her reads ''Szeszfőzde'' ("distillery" in Hungarian). Predić's initials in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], ''У.П.'', can be found in the bottom-right corner.&lt;ref name="Vienac"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Klaić|first1=Vjekoslav|authorlink1=Vjekoslav Klaić|last2=Maravić|first2=M.|title=K slikam|trans-title=On art|language=Croatian|volume=20|number=43|publisher=Vienac|location=Zagreb|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ENwxAQAAIAAJ|p=687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his notes, Predić identified the individuals depicted in the painting as "Maks" (the ''gajda'' player), Nikola Bojić (the man waving his hat) and Nikola Madžarov (the man bobbing between friends). Predić described the person to Madžarov's right as simply "a young man from Orlovat".{{sfn|Vukmanović|Živanović|2005|pp=105–106}}

===Analysis===
The [[art history|art historian]] Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson posits that the painting is informed by the progressive style of French realists such as [[Rosa Bonheur]] and [[Gustave Courbet]]. She concedes that there is no documentary evidence to suggest Predić was influenced by Courbet's depictions of peasant life, but notes that the latter's work was in the public domain at the time ''Happy Brothers'' was created and was quite popular throughout Europe. Filipovitch-Robinson believes that Predić rejected the precision and [[Perspective (graphical)|linearism]] of both [[Academic art|Academic]] and [[Biedermeier]] art, and, as Courbet would have done, used heavily textured brushstrokes to define the roughness of the muddy road. She also draws parallels between the painting and Courbet's ''[[Peasants of Flagey]]'', which was shown at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1850–51 alongside ''[[The Stone Breakers]]'' and ''[[A Burial At Ornans]]''.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=35}}

The art historian [[Dejan Medaković]] once suggested that Predić was imitating the style of satirists [[William Hogarth]] and [[Honoré Daumier]]. Filipovitch-Robinson writes that if this were so, Predić's attempt at emulation was almost certainly unsuccessful. "Perhaps this was due to the inherent limitations of his subject", she writes, "the fact that the figures are not caricatured and that the painting is devoid of biting or mocking humor".{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2007|pp=131–132}} According to Filipovitch-Robinson, Predić's treatment of Balkan rural life differs in a number of ways from that of his contemporary [[Paja Jovanović]], who was known for painting similar subjects. Jovanović's paintings were based on careful ethnographic studies of rural costumes and everyday objects, whereas Predić's works lack Jovanović's precision, owing to the artist's tendency not to produce detailed studies of his subjects beforehand. "The images", Filipovitch-Robinson writes, "are more gestural because of the combination of generous brush strokes and minimal linear definition. This painting also brings Predić much closer to the more daring experimentations of the [[Munich School]] not only because of the textural play of the mud-laden soil against rough peasant garb but in his convincing presentation of the atmosphere of the quiet predawn hours."{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2007|pp=131–132}}

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:Milan Rešetar 1904 Mayerhofer.png|thumb|right|220px|Critic [[Milan Rešetar]] considered the painting one of Predić's best works]]
Upon seeing reproductions of the painting, the villagers did not interpret it as a call to change their ways. Instead, they were flattered by Predić's decision to depict them.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=35}} "To local audiences in particular", Filipovitch-Robinson writes, "such lighthearted didacticism entwined with a familiar and beloved world was immensely satisfying".{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2002|p=366}} It is said that on one of his visits home, Predić went to the local pub and encountered the patrons examining a calendar with a reproduction of his painting inside it. A number of patrons—some of whom were included in the composition—tapped him on the shoulder in drunken stupor and commended him on how accurately he had captured them.&lt;ref name="Pivnica"/&gt; What Filipovitch-Robinson calls Predić's "well-meaning and subtle moralizing" had thus been rendered ineffectual.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=35}}

Writing for the [[Novi Sad]]-based publication ''Javor'' in 1890, the critic [[Milan Rešetar]] ranked the painting among Predić's finest works up to that point.&lt;ref name="Javor"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Rešetar|first=Milan|authorlink=Milan Rešetar|date=16 September 1890|title=Уметност|trans-title=Art|language=Serbian|volume=17|number=37|publisher=Javor|location=Novi Sad|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ftYDAAAAYAAJ|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Croatian magazine ''Vienac'' offered a positive review of the work, saying it offered a sad look at conditions in the Banat. The magazine praised Predić as "a true artist&amp;nbsp;... one who isn't afraid to use his talent to educate people and nurture the nobler aspects of human nature".&lt;ref name="Vienac"/&gt; Critics were satisfied with ''Happy Brothers'' because it not only offered an instructive narrative but also demonstrated the artist's technical abilities.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2002|p=366}} Such vignettes of village life contributed greatly to Predić's popularity among collectors from the emerging Serbian [[middle class]]. Reproductions of the painting met with commercial success, further contributing to its popularity. This led Predić to paint two replicas, one in 1918 and the other in 1922.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=35}} By 1890, the original was owned by the [[National Museum of Serbia]],&lt;ref name="Javor"/&gt; in whose possession it remains.{{sfn|Filipovitch-Robinson|2014|p=319}}

'''Jack Richard Wemp''' (November 29, 1925 – November 13, 2005) was an American artist whose painting styles spanned the Depression era, [[expressionism]], 60’s [[contemporary art]] styles, and, for the last 30 years of his life, a [[realism (art)|realist]] style reminiscent of the [[Hudson River school]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Seattle, Washington]] in 1925. At the beginning of the [[Great Depression]], his father moved the family to [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada. Encouraged by his artistically talented parents, Jack began to draw and paint at an early age and art was always his favorite school subject. In high school, he had the benefit of having a very talented and professional artist for an instructor. However, as much as an art career appealed to Jack, it seemed at the time, that a more stable career should be pursued.
During his high school summer vacations, he worked as a cowhand on the vast Half-Diamond-One cattle ranch west of [[Calgary]]. This experience led him to the agricultural college of the [[University of Alberta]], but after six months he volunteered for service in the [[Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery]] and went overseas to [[England]]. When [[World War II]] ended, Jack was appointed as a staff artist by his commanding officer and this experience reinforced his desire to pursue art as a career. Jack is a graduate of  [[Olds College|Olds School of Agriculture]] in Olds, Alberta, Canada. He studied art and advertising at the [[Alberta College of Art and Design|Provincial Institute of Technology and Arts]] in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, the California School of Art in Los Angeles and the Art Center School ([[Art Center College of Design]]) in Los Angeles where he studied under Ed Reep.

==Commercial art==
After working for Keystone press and Cockfield, Brown &amp; Co in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], he moved to [[New York City]] where he began work as an illustrator for [[Sales Graphics]], a large Mid-town studio and later became the studio's art director. After three years, he opened his own studio Wemp &amp; Williamson and later, Jack Wemp Inc. During this time he produced illustrations, graphics, film and full scale national sales shows for such notable clients as [[Breck Shampoo]], [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]] and [[American Cyanamid]]. Wemp employed the services of such notables as artists [[Sam Kweskin]], Stan Learner and writer [[John Bishop (screenwriter)|John Bishop]]. With the recession of the '70's and cutbacks in large sales shows, Wemp moved from his [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] home to Northern [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]], where he could further phase out from the Madison Avenue scene. Here Jack opened his Artists Studio in [[Rhinebeck, New York]] where he briefly dabbled in ceramics. He soon took on the position as art director and production manager for Taconic Press Newspapers from 1975 - 1977.

==Fine artist==
[[Image:John Devoys Catalpa Expedition.gif|thumb|220px|right|Cover Painting by Jack Wemp]]
Although Jack produced dozens of paintings throughout his early days and commercial career, in 1977, he all but gave up his commercial art business to begin painting full-time. A keen interest in 19th century [[sailing ships]] and [[farming]] helped to shape the subject and style of his paintings. Earlier work exhibited his expressionist style in his [[landscape art]] and [[seascape]]s. Into the 80’s as his representational style developed, his vibrancy was evident in his tumultuous seas and magnificent skies. Always a stickler for detail, his attention to perspective and shadow were second to none. Often Wemp built models for his work to capture subtle shadings. His work always had a place in the seasons and a story behind it. Much of his work exhibited a heart and arrow with JW loves PW inscribed within. This symbol would be discreetly illustrated as a carving in a tree, building or furniture and was a testimony of his love for his wife of nearly 60 years, Peggy.

==Recognition==
*His work graces the cover of ''John Devoy's Catalpa Expedition'' ([[Catalpa rescue]]) ({{ISBN|0-8147-2748-4}})
*Received The [[American Artists Professional League]] Award for Representational Art in 2004 and 2005
*Was a member and received an award from the [[Salmagundi Art Club]] in NYC.

'''Lead Pencil Studio''' is the working name of the art and architecture collaborative founded in 1997 by Annie Han and Daniel Mihalyo in order to cooperatively pursue [[installation art]], [[site-specific art]] and functional [[architecture]]. They are winners of the 2007 Founder's [[Rome Prize]] in Architecture from the [[American Academy in Rome]], and were recognized in 2006 as an 'Emerging Voices' by the [[Architectural League of New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Harthorn, Sandy (2008). "After: Effects of Constructed Space", p. 9. [[Boise Art Museum]], Boise. {{ISBN|978-0-295-98934-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their practice is self-described as "architecture in reverse...our projects are everything about architecture with none of its function...spaces with no greater purpose than to be perceived and question the certainty posited by the man-made world."&lt;ref&gt;Harthorn, Aishaz38 Sandy (2008). "After: Effects of Constructed Space", p. 43. [[Boise Art Museum]], Boise. {{ISBN|978-0-295-98934-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Han and Mihalyo met at the [[University of Oregon]] in 1991 while in the architecture program, and their relationship has evolved into a work partnership centered around Lead Pencil Studio. They have also worked in Bellingham, Chicago, Portland, and Seattle, among others. They currently reside in Seattle, Washington.

===Annie Han===
Annie Han was born in [[Pusan, South Korea]] in 1967, and attained an accredited Master's equivalent in Architecture (5-year B. Arch) from the University of Oregon in 1993 before studying sculpture for one year at [[Portland State University]] in 1994.  She is a naturalized US citizen.

===Daniel Mihalyo===
Daniel Mihalyo was born in [[Bellevue, Washington]] in 1970, and attended [[Western Washington University]] for Fine Art before attaining an accredited  Master's equivalent in Architecture (5-year B. Arch) from the University of Oregon in 1994.

==Notable Installations==

=== Maryhill Double===
Built directly across from the [[Maryhill Museum]] on the plateaus that overlook the [[Columbia River Gorge]],  ''Maryhill Double'' was a temporary installation/building  that duplicated the exact interior volume of the museum that it mirrored. Standing from July 5, 2006 through October 1, 2006 and constructed solely from scaffolding and blue construction netting, Maryhill Double re-framed not only the unusual history of the Maryhill Museum, but also the significance of constructing architecture within unadulterated landscapes. Critics have noted that "The museum and its ghost-like Double work as a paired form, operating...to emphasize the scale of their plateau site...and to dramatize the role of human effort and desire to engage nature or subdue it..."&lt;ref&gt;Sangster, Gary (2007). "Double or Nothing: A Translucent Reflection Takes Shape", p.1. [[Creative Capital]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically enough, during its lifespan the Double was classified as a "[[billboard]]" for zoning and legal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Gragg, Randy (2006). "'Maryhill Double' shimmers, mirage-like, in gorge", ''[[The Oregonian]]'', 2006-08-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retail/Commercial===
A temporary installation in an aging upscale mall located in [[Rainier Tower]] (designed by architect, [[Minoru Yamasaki]]) in Seattle, WA,&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Jen (2009). "Retail/Commercial", p. 1 [[SLOG: News &amp; Arts]], Seattle&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Retail/Commercial'' occupied a former Italian men's clothing boutique by inserting four distinct retail environments stripped of all merchandise and represented at full-scale by architectural section.  In areas where the narrow sections overlapped atop one another, the furniture, finishes and architecture appeared to cross pollinate. Material for the installation was gathered entirely from retail liquidation sales which occurred in early 2009 within a few blocks of the project.  Uniting the project linearly was a brightly lit white section complete with empty shelving, dropped ceiling, shopping carts, surveillance cameras, signage, baskets, pedestals and mannequins.

===Without Room===
''Without Room'' faithfully recreates in exacting detail the entire living room of an apartment dweller in [[Greensboro, NC]]. The piece, on display at the Weatherspoon Art Museum at [[The University of North Carolina at Greensboro]] from January 17 to April 13, 2008, reconstitutes the entirety of a woman’s possessions rendered homogenous with gray acrylic paint.  Paperwork, books, CDs, collectible treasures, furniture and electronic devices lost their biographical specificity and appeared as anonymous shapes.  Unpainted items included piles of clothing and shoes, left as an homage reference to the originating inhabitant.  The [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] installation intended to explore the [[nesting instinct|nesting]] and spatial consequences of human dwelling.  The living room was selected from a pool of volunteers through a museum advertisement searching for respondents who occupy small living spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, Jen. (2008) "Gray Area: Why Does Some Work by Lead Pencil Studio Look So Much Like Work by Other Artists?", p. 2. [[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]], Seattle. 2008-02-14.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some inspirations for the piece include Margaret Roberts and [[lidar]] surveying technology.

===After===
A two part installation at the [[Boise Art Museum]] from November 8, 2008 to May 3, 2009, ''After'' is an exploration of the modern forces that create and construct space—architecturally, visually, and conceptually.  The project was composed of two large constructions individually titled, ''After: Billboard'', and ''After: Dwelling''.  "After: Billboard" features a roped off pile of rubble with a sign surface made entirely of layered paper and [[real estate]] advertisements, capped with a window-like opening that exposes the crisscrossing two-by-fours that are the [[superstructure]].  Vaguely discernible real estate slogans and window details of this exterior piece were intended to reference the house-sized construction on the interior of the museum.   "After: Dwelling" was composed of a landscape of gravel approximately 25&amp;nbsp;ft x 50&amp;nbsp;ft with a sharply defined rectilinear impression suggesting a building foundation.  Floating above this field were corners of a house made entirely from architectural foam board and skim coated cement.  Taken together the individual pieces describe the perimeter of a house in the uncertain state of construction or demolition and featuring several design clichés identified with an anonymous [[modern architecture]].  "The Boise Weekly" noted that "...The billboard promises, 'Your Own Piece of Blue Sky!' The wall text tells us the artists are exploring the complex systems involved in the production of space. In other words, advertising dominates the view." &lt;ref&gt;Pettinger, E.J. (2008). "Ad Space: Lead Pencil Studio's 'After' Raises Questions", p. 2. [[The Boise Weekly]], Boise. 2008-11-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Avant Garde}}
[[File:Pablo picasso 1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Pablo Picasso]] 1962]]
'''Avant-garde''' ({{IPA-fr|avɑ̃ ɡaʁd}}) is [[French language|French]] for "vanguard".&lt;ref name="dictref"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=avant-garde|title=Avant-garde definitions|accessdate=2007-03-14|publisher=Lexico Publishing Group, LLC|work=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is commonly used in French, English, and German to refer to people or works that are [[experiment]]al or innovative, particularly with respect to [[art]] and [[culture]].

Avant-garde represents a pushing of the boundaries of what is accepted as the [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] or the [[status quo]], primarily in the cultural realm. The notion of the existence of the avant-garde is considered by some to be a hallmark of [[modernism]], as distinct from [[postmodernism]]. Postmodernism posits that the age of the constant pushing of boundaries is no longer with us and that avant-garde has little to no applicability in the age of [[Postmodern art]].

'''''Misunderstood''''' ({{lang-it|'''Incompreso'''}}) is a 1966 Italian [[drama film]] directed by [[Luigi Comencini]]. It was entered into the [[1967 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2787/year/1967.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Misunderstood |accessdate=8 March 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Duncombe is the UK Consul General in [[Florence]], Italy.  He becomes a widower when his two sons, Andrew and Miles, are still children.  Andrew, the eldest, apparently reacts with adult maturity to the loss of his mother, looking after little Miles, an attempt to find a way out of such premature heart-crushing loss.  Miles constantly blames Andrew for his mischievous behavior but his brother valiantly takes said blame as his personality is that of a grown up, or at least that is what he tries to be.  The father, given his mandate, is often absent, both physically and emotionally, especially toward Andrew.  It will be at the end that Duncombe will acknowledge his mistakes when finding himself at a father's point of no return.

The '''papal tombs in old St. Peter's Basilica''' were the final resting places of the [[pope]]s, most which dated from the fifth to sixteenth centuries. The majority of these tombs were destroyed during the sixteenth through seventeenth century demolition of [[old St. Peter's Basilica]], except for one which was destroyed during the [[Arab raid against Rome|Saracen Sack of the church]] in 846. The remainder were transferred in part to new [[St. Peter's Basilica]], which stands on the site of the original basilica, and a handful of other [[churches of Rome]].

Along with the repeated translations from the ancient [[catacombs of Rome]] and two fourteenth century fires in [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]], the rebuilding of St. Peter's is responsible for the destruction of approximately half of all [[List of extant papal tombs|papal tombs]]. As a result, [[Donato Bramante]], the chief architect of modern St. Peter's Basilica, has been remembered as "''Mastro Ruinante''".

Although the original basilica's construction was begun during the reign of emperor [[Constantine I]] and completed in the fourth century, [[Pope Leo I]] (440–461) was the first pope buried in the Constantian basilica.&lt;ref name="rear40"&gt;Reardon, 2004, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the centuries, both the atrium, chapels, and the nave of the basilica were packed with papal tombs, which were juggled between different sections of the church as construction took place on each section of the basilica. All that remains of the original tombs are a few sarcophagi and sculptural fragments.&lt;ref name="r272"&gt;Reardon, 2004, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; Allegedly, [[Pope Julius II]], the pope who initiated the destruction of the Constantinian basilica, wished to clear space for a "monstrous" tomb of his own by [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref name="r274"&gt;Reardon, 2004, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Very little is known about the placement and appearance of the original tombs: one of the most valuable accounts is that of church canon and historian [[Giacomo Grimaldi]] (a senator of Genoa and the father of [[Girolamo Grimaldi-Cavalleroni]]), who sketched the tombs as they were moved around the basilica on the way to their destruction;&lt;ref&gt;Grimaldi, Giacomo. Ed. R. Niggl. 1972. ''Descrizione della Basilica Antica di S. Pietro in Vaticano: Codice Barberini Latino 2733''. Vatican City.&lt;/ref&gt; Grimaldi's sketches record the shape and complexity of the early tombs, many of which were three-tiered.&lt;ref name="r272"/&gt; A few destroyed papal tombs are also detailed in the writings of [[Alphonsus Ciacconius]].&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, 2004, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all popes were buried in Rome. ''See [[list of non-extant papal tombs]]''

'''Retablos''' are a sophisticated [[Peruvian]] [[folk art]] in the form of portable boxes which depict religious, historical, or everyday events that are important to the Indigenous people of the highlands. It is a tradition originated in [[Ayacucho region|Ayacucho]].

The Spanish word ''retablo'' comes from the Latin ''retro-tabulum'' (“behind the table or altar”), which was later shortened to ''retabulum''. This is a reference to the fact that the first ''retablos'' were placed on or behind the altars of [[Catholic Church|Catholic churches]] in Spain and [[Latin America]]. They were three-dimensional statues or images inside a decorated frame.

==Origins==

[[Image:Retablo2-Santiago.jpeg|right|frame|2. ''Santiago'' (St James)]]

The ''retablos'' probably originated with the Christian knights of the Crusades and the Spanish ''reconquista'' (the 700-year struggle against the Moors in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]).

The Christian warriors, who frequently found themselves far away from their home churches, carried small portable box-altars for worship and protection against their enemies. These earliest ''retablos'' usually featured religious themes, especially those involving ''Santiago'' (Saint James), the patron saint-warrior in the fight against the Moors.

''Retablos'' came to the New World as small portable altars, Nativity scenes and other religious topics used by the early priests to evangelize the Indigenous.

==Adam and Eve==

[[Image:Retablo3-Adam&amp;Eve.jpeg|left|frame|3. Adam and Eve]]

There is a story of how a [[Holy Orders|Catholic priest]] effectively used a ''retablo'' to hold the attention of his Indigenous audience. He began with a closed ''retablo'', and told a long story about what was in the box, which he kept closed:

* a naked man
* ...a naked woman
* ...a snake
* ...temptation...
* sin...and punishment.
* He eventually opened the box and revealed that he was talking about...the [[creation myth]] of Adam and Eve.

==Patron saint of cattle== 

[[Image:Retablo4-Patron.jpeg|right|frame|4. St. Mark, patron of animals]]

In a syncretic process, the early ''retablos'' brought by the Spanish merged with Indigenous beliefs in the Andean region to acquire certain magical or symbolic properties which had been the attributes of local spirits before the Conquest. This was particularly true of the ''retablos'' named after [[Mark the Evangelist|St. Mark]], known as ''cajones sanmarcos'' (“boxes of St. Mark”). Since St. Mark is the [[patron saint]] of farm animals, his spirit was used to invoke protection of cattle from disease and theft. These early ''retablos'' were wooden boxes with figures inside carved from stone, ivory or wood.

==Daily life and identity==

[[Image:Retablo5-Corn.harvest.jpeg|left|frame|5. Corn harvest]]

Later, ''retablos'' evolved to include daily scenes in the lives of the Andean people, such as harvests, processions, feasts, and tableaux depicting shops and homes.

The use of wood for the outside box remained, but other materials, such as gypsum, clay, or a potato-gypsum-clay paste mix, were increasingly used for the figures because of their ease of handling and durability.

In the 1940s more and more artists were using ''retablos'' as a vehicle for affirming and recording the distinct identity of the Indigenous people of the Andean region. They are also a defense of [[Indigenous peoples|Indigenous culture]] and values in the face of the modernization and the penetration of their culture by that of the white Hispanic elites of Lima.

==Ayacucho and Nicario Jiménez==

[[Image:Retablo7-NicarioJ.jpeg|right|frame|6. Nicario Jiménez Quispe]]

The tradition of making ''cajones sanmarcos'' or ''retablos'' is very strong in the mountainous Peruvian region around the city of Ayacucho. In recent years the [[Political terrorism|political violence]] and the fighting between the [[Peruvian Army]] and the Marxist ''Sendero Luminoso'' (“Shining Path”) ''guerrillas'' around Ayacucho has forced many peasant families in the area to migrate to the capital city of Lima, where they make and sell their crafts commercially.

[[Nicario Jiménez Quispe]] (Quispe is his mother’s name) is a master artisan of the craft of making retablos. He was born in 1957 in a small highland Andean village near Ayacucho, and learned how to make ''retablos'' from his father and other skilled craftsmen. He has studied at the University of San Marcos in Lima, and has exhibited his retablos in Peru and abroad in several international competitions. His photo was taken while doing a demonstration at American University’s Language and Foreign Studies Department in 1991.

==Ayacucho==

[[Image:Retablo6-Ayacucho.jpeg|left|frame|7. Ayacucho, Peru]]

In 1968 Nicario’s family moved from their small village to the city of Ayacucho. A decade later Nicario Jiménez had his first chance to display his ''retablos'' alongside those of his father in a Lima gallery. The quality of and unique style of his work quickly caught the attention of many Peruvian and foreign connoisseurs of retablo folk art. In 1986 he opened his own workshop-gallery in Lima.

==His themes==

[[Image:Retablo8-Cross.jpeg|right|frame|8. Cross with coca leaves]]

He frequently injects elements that remind us of his Andean heritage. For example, this Crucifix has three [[Coca|coca leaves]] below the heart of Christ. He says he put them there to remind us that coca leaves (not cocaine) play an important role in Indigenous Andean cultures.

==The ''curandero'' (shaman)==

[[Image:Retablo9-Curandero.jpeg|left|frame|9. ''Curandero'' (shaman)]]

The shaman, or ''curandero'' (healer) practices [[traditional medicine|traditional folk medicine]]. He uses various herbs, including coca leaves, and passes a live Andean [[guinea pig]] (the ''cuy'') over the body or the patient as a [[Diagnosis|diagnostic tool]]. The ''cuy'' is then killed and its entrails studied to diagnose the illness and prescribe treatment, which is a combination of traditional [[medicinal herbs]] and Christian practices.

==''Yawar fiesta''==

[[Image:Retablo10-Yawar.fiesta.jpeg|right|frame|10. “''Yawar fiesta''”]]

This ''retablo'' shows a ceremony (“''Yawar Fiesta''”) involving a struggle between a bull (symbol of the Spanish) and a condor (symbol of the Andeans). The condor is tied to the back of the bull, who is infuriated and cannot rid itself of the condor, and eventually dies from exhaustion. The condor is then set free. It spreads its wings, and it becomes the symbol of the freedom of the Andean Indigenous peoples.

==The ''Pistaku'' (cutter of throats)==

[[Image:Retablo11-Pistaku.jpeg|left|frame|11. The ''Pistaku'']]

''[[Pistaku]]'' is a Quechua Indigenous word meaning “cutter of throats,” and he is the subject of an [[oral tradition]] among the Andean people. The ''Pistaku'' attacks and kills solitary travelers in the countryside in order to extract their fat. He is portrayed as a foreigner, and is tall, bearded, wears boots, and generally looks like a European.

The top part of the ''retablo'' represents the Colonial period and shows the ''Pistaku'' dressed as a Franciscan priest who extracts human fat to make bells whose sound varies according to the victim.

The middle portion shows the [[Modern Times (history)|modern period]] when the ''Pistaku'', wearing a cape, is a long-haired ''gringo'' who extracts fat to lubricate his airplanes and machines.

The final portion of the ''retablo'' is contemporary. The ''Pistaku'' appears more violent, especially in the period of former President Alán García. The human fat he extracts now not only serves to lubricate airplanes and machinery, but also to pay the [[external debt]] and buy weapons.

==''Sendero Luminoso'' (“Shining Path”)==

[[Image:Retablo12-Sendero.jpeg|right|frame|12. ''Sendero Luminoso'' (Shining Path)]]

In recent years there have been more controversial ''retablos'', such as those showing exploitation and mistreatment of the Indigenous peoples, and the plight of the Andean people caught between leftist ''guerrillas'' and the security forces of the State.

One recurring theme is the way the ''campesino'' is caught between the ''Sendero Luminoso'' (Shining Path) Marxist ''guerrillas'' and the military.

[[File:RIBA SIlver Medal.jpg|thumb|The RIBA SIlver Medal is awarded annually by the Royal Institute of British Architects to a student or recent graduate of Architecture.]]

==History==
The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) has been awarding the President's Medals annually since 1836, the year when George Godwin was awarded the Honorary Silver Medal for his essay 'Nature and Properties of Concrete, and its Application to Construction up to the Current Period'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History|url=http://www.presidentsmedals.com/history.aspx|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medals are awarded in three categories: the Bronze Medal for best design project at RIBA Part 1 or equivalent; the Silver Medal for best design project at RIBA Part 2 or equivalent, and the Dissertation Medal (written during either Part 1 or Part 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentsmedals.com/prizes.aspx|title=Prizes 2012|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judges also award up to three commendations in each category, and the Serjeant Awards for Excellence in Drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A glimpse of the future|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=18781|accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the RIBA’s oldest awards (preceding the [[Royal Gold Medal]], which was formally established in 1848), the [http://www.presidentsmedals.com/ RIBA President’s Medals] continue to this day to embody the Institute’s commitment to architecture and the education of individuals into understanding architecture's wider social benefits.

==Judging==
An international jury of distinguished architects, designers and artists select the winners from entries submitted by schools of architecture worldwide. Former judges included [[Cedric Price]], [[David Adjaye]], [[David Chipperfield]], [[Denys Lasdun]], [[Daniel Libeskind]], [[Ian Ritchie (architect)|Ian Ritchie]], [[Michael Hopkins (architect)|Michael Hopkins]], Simon Hudspith, [[Eva Jiricna]], [[Will Alsop]], [[Bob Allies]], [[Kazuyo Sejima]], [[Patrik Schumacher|Patrick Schumacher]], [[Ken Shuttleworth (architect)|Ken Shuttleworth]], [[Benedetta Tagliabue]], [[Ian Davidson (architect)|Ian Davidson]], [[Bruce McLean]], [[Odile Decq]], [[Lella Vignelli]], [[Farshid Moussavi]], [[Nathalie de Vries|Nanako Umemoto, Nathalie de Vries]], [[Eric Parry|Eric Parry,]] [[Vicky Richardson]], Ellen Van Loon, Catherine Slessor, Harriet Harriss, and Julia B. Bolles-Wilson.

==Ceremony==
The winners receive their awards from the RIBA President at a ceremony that takes place at the RIBA in early December of each year and is attended by over 300 people. Guest speakers have included [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]], [[Richard Rogers]], Mark Lawson, Richard MacCormac, [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]], Martha Schwartz, and [[Alex James (musician)|Alex James]].

==Exhibition==
An exhibition of winning work and of a selection of entries submitted is exhibited at the RIBA HQ in London for two months before touring throughout the UK and internationally. Over the last few years, and after closing in London, the President’s Medals exhibition has been displayed in the UK (Belfast, Bournemouth, Canterbury, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leicester, Liverpool, Newcastle, and Plymouth) and also travelled internationally to Australia, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Cyprus, Egypt, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Kuwait, India, Ireland, Lebanon, Malaysia, Oman, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates. The touring of the exhibition is made possible by the generosity of art galleries and schools of architecture that partner with the RIBA to display the exhibition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8381">[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-15750, Ausstellung "Deutsches Volk-Deutsche Arbeit".jpg|thumb|right|Nazi German architecture mixing modernist design with the antiquated, ancient [[Swastika]] symbol]]
"'''Reactionary modernism'''" is a term first coined by [[Jeffrey Herf]] in his 1984 book, ''Reactionary Modernism: Technology, Culture and Politics in Weimar and the Third Reich'', to describe the mixture of "great enthusiasm for modern [[technology]] with a rejection of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the values and institutions of [[liberal democracy]]" which was characteristic of the German [[Conservative Revolutionary movement]] and [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name=Herf&gt;[https://www.the-american-interest.com/article.cfm?piece=651 The Totalitarian Present: Why the West Consistently Underplays the Power of Bad Ideas, Jeffrey Herf, The American Interest]&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, this ideology of reactionary [[modernism]] was closely linked to the original, positive view of the ''[[Sonderweg]]'', which saw Germany as the great Central European power neither of the West nor of the East.

Herf's application of the term to describe [[fascism]] has been widely echoed by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Neocleous, ''Fascism'', University of Minnesota Press, 1997, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Herf had used the term to denote a trend in intellectual thought during the era, what German novelist [[Thomas Mann]] had described as "a highly technological romanticism" during the interwar years. Herf used the term in reference to a wide range of German cultural figures, including [[Ernst Jünger]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Carl Schmitt]], and [[Hans Freyer]].

==Reception of the concept==
Historian Nicolas Guilhot has broadened the scope of reactionary modernism, applying the term to trends in [[Weimar Republic]] industry, medicine ([[eugenics]]), mass politics, and social engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guilhot|first=Nicolas|title=The Invention of International Relations Theory: Realism, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the 1954 Conference on Theory|year=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231152679|pages=213–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reactionary modernism can be seen in the fascist concept of the [[New Man (utopian concept)|New Man]], as well as in art movements of [[Weimar culture]] that emphasized rationalism and embraced [[Futurism]] and the [[New Objectivity]]. Many Weimar period artists rejected the Futurists' [[fetishization]] of machinery and violence, for example the proponents of [[German Expressionism]]. Despite this, the [[return to order]] became a dominant theme in German culture and in that of other European countries.

Reactionary modernism has been explored as a theme in the interwar literature and broader political culture of Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zox-Weaver|first=Annalisa|title=Women Modernists and Fascism|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107008526|pages=7–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been examined in the context of other European countries during the interwar period, including Romania,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cotoi|first=Calin|title=Nationalisms Today|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9783039118830|pages=125|editor=Tomasz Kamusella, Krzysztof Jaskułowski|chapter=Reactionary Modernism in Interwar Romania: Anton Golopentia and the Geopoliticization of Sociology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bien|first=Peter|title=Greek Modernism and Beyond: Essays in Honor of Peter Bien|year=1997|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847685776|pages=96–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pietikäinen|first=Petteri|title=Neurosis and Modernity: The Age of Nervousness in Sweden|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004160750|pages=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Jensen, Irrational Triumph: Cultural Despair, Military Nationalism, and the Ideological Origins of Franco's Spain (Reno: University of Nevada Press, 2001), 4.&lt;/ref&gt; It has even been examined in the context of fascism in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tansman|first=Alan|title=The Culture of Japanese Fascism|year=2009|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822344681|pages=336–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians acknowledge the term's recognition of an influential trend in European philosophical, cultural and political thought during the period when fascism was on the rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Critchley|first=Simon|title=Continental Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780192853592|pages=N.p.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the neologism was created by Herf, it has gained mainstream currency with historians in discussing the paradoxical European enthusiasm for paternalistic authoritarianism and [[volkish]] nationalism on the one hand, and new technological and political concepts on the other hand, all under [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Dyke|first=James A.|title=Franz Radziwill and the Contradictions of German Art History, 1919-45|year=2010|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=9780472116287|pages=1|chapter=Introduction: Reactionary Modernism and the Problem of Nazi Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herf now applies the term to claim similarity to the governments of [[Iran]] under the Ayatollahs, the government of [[Iraq]] under [[Saddam Hussein]], and extremist [[Islamist]] groups such as [[Al Qaeda]].&lt;ref name=Herf/&gt; Other scholars, including [[Paul Berman]], have also applied Herf's term to radical  Islamism.&lt;ref&gt;Power and the idealists, or, The passion of Joschka Fischer and its aftermath, Paul Berman, Soft Skull Press, 2005, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fascism, Mark Neocleous, University of Minnesota Press, 1997, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New World Empire: Civil Islam, Terrorism, and the Making of Neoglobalism, William H. Thornton, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2005, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radical Islam: Medieval Theology and Modern Politics, Emmanuel Sivan, Yale University Press, 1990, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural critic [[Richard Barbrook]] argues that members of the [[digerati]], who adhere to the [[Californian Ideology]], embrace a form of reactionary modernism which combines [[economic growth]] with [[social stratification]].&lt;ref name="Barbrook 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = [[Richard Barbrook|Barbrook, Richard]] | title = Cyber-Communism: How The Americans Are Superseding Capitalism In Cyberspace | year = 1999 | url = http://www.imaginaryfutures.net/2007/04/17/cyber-communism-how-the-americans-are-superseding-capitalism-in-cyberspace/ | accessdate = 2010-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Rohkrämer criticized the concept of reactionary modernism, arguing "It is simply not strange or 'paradoxical to reject the Enlightenment and embrace technology at the same time', but a common practice in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Germany as well as in many other countries. Instrumental reason and technology are available for an endless number of different purposes, many of which are not humane or enlightened".&lt;ref&gt;Rohkämer, Thomas, [http://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/21039/1/download.pdf  "Antimodernism, Reactionary Modernism and National Socialism. Technocratic Tendencies in Germany, 1890-1945"], accessed 28/12/2016, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Support for this view also came from Roger Griffin, who argued "[F]ascism as an ''ideology'' and ''movement'' can be seen as proposing a radical alternative to liberal and socialist visions of what form modernity ideally should take. It represents an uncompromising rejection both of thorough-going liberalism and extreme 'modernism', whose logical culmination it sees as relativism, anomie, subjectivism, and the loss of definitive meaning and 'eternal' values. It is an attempt to re-anchor modern human beings within that highly modern phenomenon, the totalitarian state (a term used positively by Fascism) through consciously manipulated historical, national and racist myth (all deeply modern ideological constructs)".&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Griffin|Griffin, Roger]], [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.194.6474&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "Modernity under the New Order: The Fascist Project for Managing the Future"], published by Thamesman Publications, Oxford Brookes School of Business imprint, 1994, accessed 28/12/2016, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Sail Away to Avalon'''" is the first single by [[Ayreon]], released on 1995, from their album  ''[[The Final Experiment]]''. The song combines elements of medieval classical music with [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[Folk music|folk]] using instruments such as the [[harpsichord]] for the rhythm sections. The lyrics reinforce this theme, telling the tale of a grand adventure to "[[Avalon]]" to recover the [[holy grail]]. The single is a re-recording of Ayreon's demo EP. All songs from the demo, except "the Accusation" were re-recorded for the single EP and the compilation album, ''[[Ayreonauts Only]]'' (also not including "Sail Away to Avalon").

== ''Spill: Scenes of Black Feminist Fugitivity'' ==
''Spill'' is a 2017 book of prose and poetry by Alexis Pauline Gumbs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/spill|title=Spill|work=Duke University Press|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a labor of love, and an experimental and poetic work of literary criticism based on the work of [[Hortense Spillers]] and the literary archive of freedom seeking black women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alexispauline.com/brillianceremastered/bio/|title=Bio|last=Gumbs|first=Alexis Pauline|date=22 Mar 2018|website=alexispauline.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 Mar 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Containing the first syllable of Spillers’ last name, it is an ode to Hortense, the individual, as much as it nurtures–and is nurtured by–black femme folk across vast spatiotemporal locations. The subtitle, "''Scenes of Black Feminist Fugitivity"'' nods to [[Saidiya Hartman]]’s Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-making in Nineteenth Century America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/scenes-of-subjection-9780195089844?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=Scenes of Subjection: Terror, Slavery, and Self-Making in Nineteenth-Century America|date=1997-09-04|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195089844|series=Race and American Culture|location=Oxford, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work pays homage to not just Saidiya, and not just Hortense, in fact not any singular “I” understood within a Cartesian ''"[[Cogito ergo sum]]''" which would subordinate the collective to the individual. “When I turned these phrases, doors opened and everyone came through,” Gumbs writes of her engagement with Spillers’ work, “all the black women writers Spillers wrote about and didn’t write about. All the characters those black women writers acknowledged and ignored.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Gumbs converses with black study and black womanhood: past, present, and future.

== Interventions ==
By introducing the concept of writing "with" black women as opposed to writing "about" or "to" an audience, ''Spill'' is testament to the fact that an academic book can be written whilst citing one black woman directly in the text. This is a key intervention, performance, and achievement. Every in-text citation references Spillers’s ''Black, White, and in Color: Essays on American Literature and Culture.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo3624045.html|title=Black, White, and in Color}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Spill’''s endnotes, Gumbs lists a bibliography of “Indirect References and Suggested Reading,” composed entirely of women of color authors––most of whom are black. If nothing else, the following message is clear: read and cite black women. By engaging Spillers through poetry, an omnitemporal, omnipresent black womanhood emerges on the page. 

== Reception ==
Hortense Spillers stated in public conversation: "Nobody else is like Alexis. ...There is really nothing else like this book in my experience as a student, a scholar, a reader, a teacher. The kind of conversation that the text is setting up between poetry and prose, and between a poetic posture and a scholarly posture, I don't think I've ever seen that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=John Hope Franklin Center at Duke University|title=Left of Black with Hortense Spillers and Alexis Pauline Gumbs|date=2017-03-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui-EZQ1BTfE&amp;t=1989s|accessdate=2018-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The La Review of books calls it "''a 'poetilitical praxis,' an unflinching look at what pain has wrought and what fruit might yet be born.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/we-stay-in-love-with-our-freedom-a-conversation-with-alexis-pauline-gumbs/#!|title=We Stay in Love with Our Freedom: A Conversation with Alexis Pauline Gumbs - Los Angeles Review of Books|work=Los Angeles Review of Books|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Spill'' was nominee in the '''29th [[Lambda Literary Awards]],''' held on June 12, 2017 in the category of LGBTQ Non-Fiction.

The book was also reviewed by [[Bitch (magazine)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/spill-scenes-black-feminist-fugitivity/alexis-pauline-gumbs|title=“Spill” Maps a Future In Which Black Women Inherit the Universe|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - The Altar of St. John.jpg|thumb|620px|[[Rogier van der Weyden]]'s ''St John Altarpiece''. Oil on oak panel, each frame 77 x 48cm. [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]]]

The '''''St John Altarpiece''''' (German - ''Johannesaltar'', ''Johannestafel'' or ''Johannesretabel'') is a c. 1455 oil-on-oak wood [[panel painting|panel]] [[altarpiece]] by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Rogier van der Weyden]], now in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]. The triptych is linked to the artist's earlier ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' in its symbolic motifs, format and intention.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;Acres, 422-51&lt;/ref&gt;

The panels show – from left to right – the birth of [[John the Apostle|Saint John]], the baptism of Christ by John in [[Jordan]], and the [[beheading of St. John the Baptist|beheading of John]], with the rather attractive [[Salome]] receiving the disembodied head on a plate. Each panel is set within painted [[archivolt]]s, which contain painted reliefs depicting statuettes of the apostles,&lt;ref name="r1"&gt;Reed, 1&lt;/ref&gt; and scenes from the lives of both Christ and John, with the overall theme of salvation. The faux sculptural reliefs are painted in [[grisaille]], and give the impression that the scenes are set within a church.&lt;ref name="j92"&gt;Jacobs, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two extant versions of the altarpiece, almost equal in size, leading to complexities in establishing attribution and authenticity. The version in Berlin is considered the original, that in Frankfurt a near contemporary copy.

==Description==
The three panels describe the major events in John's life: his birth, baptism of Christ, and his decapitation at the hands of Salome. The reliefs in the archivolts detail secondary events from his life. The overall theme is of the [[sacrament]]s, each panel can be associated with a specific [[liturgical]] ceremony.&lt;ref name="l655"&gt;Lane, 655&lt;/ref&gt; Of the six archivolt scenes, four detail scenes of Mary's life, including the "Marriage of the Virgin", the "Annunciation" and the "Birth of Christ".&lt;ref name="r4"&gt;Reed, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of John===

The archivolts of this panel show the angel appearing to John's father [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]], in the temple. According to Luke 1:12–17, an angel of the Lord had earlier appeared and announced to Zechariah that his wife would give birth to a son, whom he was to name John, and that this son would be the forerunner of the Lord. Citing their advanced age, Zechariah asked with disbelief for a sign so he would know the truth of this prophecy. In reply, the angel identified himself as Gabriel, sent by God, and stated that because of Zechariah's doubt he would be struck dumb and "not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed". This punishment of muteness is referred to in the archivolt reliefs.&lt;ref name="l659"&gt;Lane, 659&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Birth and Naming of Saint John the Baptist Petites Heures du Duc de Berry.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''Birth and Naming of Saint John the Baptist'', before 1388, [[Petites Heures de Jean de Berry]], Folio 207r]]
Zacharias appears in the main panel sitting in the foreground with a pen and scroll. To his right, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] presents his son to him. By including the Virgin, Rogier strays from the Gospel account of the scene, referring instead to the apocryphal version popularised by the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' and the ''[[Meditations on the Life of Christ]]'', both of which have Mary presenting the child John. [[Erwin Panofsky]] suggests that Rogier might have been influenced by [[Andrea Pisano]]'s relief ''The Naming of the Baptist'' at the [[Florence Baptistery]], which shows a similar scene of Mary presenting to Zechariah, who sits holding a pen and scroll.&lt;ref name="l659" /&gt;

===Baptism of Christ===
In the central panel John can be identified by his red robe.&lt;ref&gt;Soudavar, 66&lt;/ref&gt; This panel shows the apparition of God in the sky above painted in red hues, from which emanates a curved Latin script, above a dove. The panels are typical of the harmony and unity characteristic of Rogier; especially in the manner in which the figures echo each other. This is most evident in the figure of the woman in the birth panel, who occupies the same space and resembles Salome to the far right.

[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - The Altar of St. John - Google Art Project 1.jpg|400px|thumb|Detail of the central panel showing the head of God]]
Christ stands fully frontal to the viewer, positioned in a stream with water rising to just below his knees. To his right John blesses him, with his hand raised over Christ's head. [[God the Father]] is shown ascending from the clouds. He sends down a dove to bless the occasion.  The dove is accompanied by, in art historian Barbara Lane's words, a "gracefully curving inscription" taken from Matthew 17:5, which reads "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him."&lt;ref name="l656"&gt;Lane, 656&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the baptism is where Jesus is first presented as the son of God, his divinity first revealed to the world, here symbolised by the ascendance of the dove and God's words.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, 36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of John===
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - The Altar of St. John - Google Art Project 2.jpg|thumb|400px|Detail; Salome receives John's severed head on a platter]]
The right hand panel is unusually dramatic and also deviates from the Gospel account. Instead of a prison setting, the scene is shown in a domestic interior.&lt;ref name="l662"&gt;Lane, 662&lt;/ref&gt; In most depictions, Salome holds an empty charger; here the head has been placed on the charger.&lt;ref name="l663"&gt;Lane, 663&lt;/ref&gt; John's limp body lies at the foot of the stairs, blood pumping from the neck, as the executioner, still holding his sword, hands the head to Salome on a golden [[Horses in warfare|charger]]. Salome, according to Lane, "demurely averts her glance", as does the executioner, who turns right to look out of a large window. In the background, she is shown presenting the head to her mother, the Judaean princess [[Herodias]], at what appears to be the [[Beheading of St. John the Baptist|Feast of Herod]].&lt;ref name="l662" /&gt;

[[File:Salome with the Head of John the Baptist.jpg|thumb|220px|left|[[Limbourg brothers]], ''Salome Presents the Head of John the Baptist at the Banquet of Herod'', 1405–1408-09. [[Belles Heures of Jean de France, Duc de Berry]], fol. 212v]]

Salome is painted to the late Gothic ideal, with narrow shoulders, thin frame and generic idealised face. She wears a headdress, and blue dress, with white lining and green under-sleeves.

In the panel, Rogier makes reference to the [[Communion (Christian)|Communion]], in that John's head "signifies the body of Christ which feeds us on the
holy altar". Lane writes that "Salome's charger&amp;nbsp;... apparently corresponds to the golden paten on which the Host is placed during the sacrifice of the Mass."&lt;ref name="l663" /&gt; Art historian Victoria Reed agrees with this analysis, noting that John's head has become a eucharistic symbol, and that "by receiving it, Salome takes the part of the Christian communicant." She observes that the charger resembles a [[paten]], while the sleeves of Salome's dress are "reminiscent of a liturgical cloth with which to bear the sacrament."&lt;ref name="r7"&gt;Reed, 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The work was commissioned by Battista Agnelli, a merchant from [[Pisa]], for Saint James's Church, [[Bruges]]. It is smaller than van der Weyden's other altarpieces, and probably intended as a side altarpiece or private devotional object. The frames are mounted together and cannot fold inwards. Therefore, it is not a triptych, but a purpose designed [[altarpiece]]. It is thought to have been commissioned by a Spanish donor; there is compelling evidence that it is the same work described in a Carthusian monastery of [[Monastery of Santa Maria de las Cuevas|Santa Maria de las Cuevas]], in [[Seville]]. José Martín Rincón, in 1744 wrote of a "portable oratory" showing the Baptism of Christ, flanked by scenes of John's birth, and beheading, though he attributed [[Albrecht Dürer]]. In 1778 the Spanish historian [[Antonio Ponz]]  mentioned the same altarpiece, noting that "each one of the scenes is included within two pilasters and an arch".&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;Reed, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution==
Panofsky dates the altarpiece to after 1450, based on the similarity of the left hand panel to Andrea Pisano's relief; Rogier may have seen it during his visit to Italy that year.&lt;ref name="l659" /&gt; Dendrochronological examination dates the wood as ready for use as a panel painting at about 1454.&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; Most art historians see the altarpiece as inextricably linked with the ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'', thus associating it with van der Weyden. Panofsky described them as "almost indistinguishable" in style and quality.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 259&lt;/ref&gt; Later Shirley Blum wrote that "the two altarpieces are as alike formally as they are in devotional character&amp;nbsp;... one should examine more closely the possibility that they originally came from the same place". Victoria Reed believes the similarities so pronounced that it is highly probable that the two were intended to hang together at the Miraflores monastery.&lt;ref name="r9"&gt;Reed, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stop Tony Meow''' is a [[browser extension]] which replaces photos of former Australian prime minister [[Tony Abbott]] with images of cats and [[kitten]]s on websites. Initially created for [[Google Chrome]], the extension was expanded to [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] and [[Firefox]] later in 2014. The extension was created by [[Web developer|developers]] and designers Dan Nolan, Ben Taylor and Matt Kelsh.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Replacing Abbott with kittens: Q&amp;A with the co-creator of Stop Tony Meow|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/australia-news-blog/2014/feb/06/replacing-abbott-with-kittens-qa-with-the-co-creator-of-stop-tony-meow|website = The Guardian|accessdate = 15 December 2015|first = Paul|last = Farrell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Stop Tony Meow' – new online app replaces pictures of PM with cats|url = http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/02/06/stop-tony-meow-new-online-app-replaces-pictures-pm-cats|website = News|accessdate = 15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extension became very popular with over 100,000 users by September 2014, and in the same year it was selected by the [[National Library of Australia]] to be included in its [[Pandora Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Purrfect politics: Stop Tony Meow to give historians paws for thought|url = http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/09/16/purrfect-politics-stop-tony-meow-give-historians-paws-thought|website = News|accessdate = 15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stop Tony Meow|url = http://nla.gov.au/nla.arc-148377|date = 1 January 2014|accessdate = 15 December 2015|publisher = [[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The script searches for "abbott" in a page's source code and replaces the image with a photo from Placekitten, a service which displays placeholder cat images on websites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In response to the popularity of Stop Tony Meow, the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] changed their website to prevent images of their then-leader being replaced.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stopping 'Stop Tony Meow': how web plug-in caught the Department of Prime Minister's attention|url = http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/stopping-stop-tony-meow-how-web-plugin-caught-the-department-of-prime-ministers-attention-20140422-zqxuu.html|website = The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate = 15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Freedom of information request ==
Curious to read what the prime minister and government thought of the software, Nolan lodged a [[freedom of information]] request for any documents containing the words "Stop Tony Meow" with the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Australia)|Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet]]. Speaking to [[The Sydney Morning Herald]], Nolan stated, "it would be really interesting to see how a government department reacts to these weird new kinds of technology and culture jamming stuff, which previously they wouldn't have had to deal with."

A search produced over 137 pages of correspondence, for which Nolan was charged $720.30. The fee was not paid and so the documents were not released. Nolan challenged the cost with the department, arguing that the documents were in the public interest, but the request was denied.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nolan later considered fundraising among friends to access the documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Stop Tony Meow': The web plug-in that swapped pictures of Australian|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/stop-tony-meow-government-uses-over-130-pages-talking-about-plug-in-that-swaps-tony-abbott-with-9274549.html|website = The Independent|accessdate = 15 December 2015|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26549">The phrase '''synesthesia in art''' has historically referred to a wide variety of artists experiments that have explored the co-operation of the senses (e.g. seeing and hearing; the word synesthesia is from the Ancient Greek σύν (syn), "together," and αἴσθησις (aisthēsis), "sensation") in the genres of [[visual music]], [[music visualization]], [[audiovisual art]], [[abstract film]], and [[intermedia]] (Campen 2007, Jewanski &amp; Sidler 2006, Moritz 2003, 1999, Berman 1999, Maur 1999, Gage 1994, 1999).  The age-old artistic views on synesthesia have some overlap with the current neuroscientific view on [[synesthesia|neurological synesthesia]], but also some major differences, e.g. in the contexts of investigations, types of synesthesia selected, and definitions. While in neuroscientific studies synesthesia is defined as the elicitation of perceptual experiences in the absence of the normal sensory stimulation, in the arts the concept of synaesthesia is more often defined as the simultaneous perception of two or more stimuli as one gestalt experience (Campen 2009). 
The usage of the term synesthesia in art should, therefore, be differentiated from [[synesthesia|neurological synesthesia]] in scientific research. Synesthesia is by no means unique to artists or musicians. Only in the last decades have scientific methods become available to assess synesthesia in persons. For synesthesia in artists before that time one has to interpret (auto)biographical information. For instance, there has been debate on the neurological synesthesia of historical artists like [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] and [[Scriabin]] (cf. Jewanski &amp; Sidler 2006, Ione 2004, Dann 1999, Galeyev 2001). 
Additionally, Synesthetic art may refer to either art created by synesthetes or art created to elicit synesthetic experience in the general audience.

==Distinctions==
When discussing synesthesia in art, a distinction needs to be made between two possible meanings:
# Art by synesthetes, in which they draw on their personal synesthetic perceptions to create works of art.
# Art that is meant to evoke synesthetic associations in a general (mainly non-synesthetic) audience.

These distinctions are not mutually exclusive, as, for example, art by a synesthete might also evoke synesthesia-like experiences in the viewer. However, it should not be assumed that all "synesthetic" art accurately reflects the synesthetic experience. For more on artists who either were synesthetes themselves, or who attempted to create synesthesia-like mappings in their art, see the [[list of people with synesthesia]].

== Art by synesthetes==
[[Image:SteenVision.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Vision'' by Carol Steen; Oil on Paper; 15 × 12¾ inches; 1996]]

Several contemporary visual artists have discussed their artistic process, and how synesthesia helps them in this, at length.&lt;ref name="Steen"&gt;Steen, C. (2001). Visions Shared: A Firsthand Look into Synesthesia and Art, Leonardo, Vol. 34, No. 3, Pages 203-208 {{doi|10.1162/002409401750286949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carol Steen]] experiences multiple forms of synesthesia, including grapheme → color synesthesia, music → color synesthesia, and touch → color synesthesia. She most often uses her music → color synesthesia and touch → color synesthesia in creating her works of art, which often involves attempting to capture, select, and transmit her synesthetic experiences into her paintings. Steen describes how her synesthetic experience during an acupuncture session led to the creation of the painting ''Vision''.

{{quotation|One day, many years ago, I was having an acupuncture treatment and was lying flat on my back, on a futon, stuck full of needles. My eyes were shut and I watched intently, as I always do, hoping to see something magical, which does not always occur. Sometimes what I see is just not interesting or beautiful. Lying there, I watched the soft, undulating, black background I always see when I shut my eyes become pierced by a bright red colour that began to form in the middle of the rich velvet blackness. The red began as a small dot of intense colour and grew quite large rather quickly, chasing much of the blackness away. I saw green shapes appear in the midst of the red colour and move around the red and black fields. This is the first vision that I painted exactly as I saw it... |Artist Carol Steen, recalling the experience that led to the creation of ''Vision''.&lt;ref name="Steen"/&gt;}}

[[Image:SmilackWeekends.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Weekends Are Taller than Weekdays'' by Marcia Smilack; [[Inkjet]] ([[Giclee]]) print on watercolor paper, 40 × 60 inches; 2003]]

Rather than trying to create depictions of what she experiences, "Reflectionist" Marcia Smilack uses her synesthetic experience in guiding her towards creating images that are aesthetically pleasing and appealing to her. Smilack takes pictures of reflected objects, mostly using the surface of the water, and says of her photography style:

{{quotation|I taught myself to take pictures by shooting whenever I experience a synesthetic reaction to what I see: if I experience a sensation of texture, motion or taste, I take the picture. If the reflection elicits the sound of cello, I shoot the picture. I photograph reflections on moving water. It works like this: I watch the surface of the sea until I experience one of my synesthetic responses. When I do, I trust it to be a reliable signal that tells me it is the right time to take the picture, so I click the shutter. Within the creative process, I think of my synesthetic responses as vital messengers that arrive faster than thought to deliver one urgent message which I always heed: beauty is lurking. |Reflectionist Marcia Smilack on her photography technique&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marciasmilack.com/synethesia-intro.php Marcia Smilack Website] Accessed 20 Aug 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anne Salz, a Dutch musician and visual artist, perceives music in colored patterns. She describes her painting inspired by Vivaldi’s ''Concerto for Four Violins'':

[[Image:Salz vivaldi2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Vivaldi'' by Anne Salz; Oil on Board, 50 × 50 cm; 2003]]

{{quotation|The painting represents the opening of the concerto for four violins. I listen to the music while I paint. First, the music gives me an optimistic, happy feeling and I perceive red, yellow, and orange colors in a great variety with little contrast. It looks like a field of these colors. I perceive the color field as a musical chord. You can compare it with the colors of a blanket or cover made of autumn leaves.}}

She explains that the painting is not a copy of what she hears; rather, when she listens to music, she perceives more colorful textures than she normally perceives and she is able to depict them in the painting. She also expresses the movement of the music, as its energy influences the pictorial composition. She explains how she perceives the painting:
{{quotation|The lively movements in the music become a stream of glowing shades of orange. The black structure provides cadence and reveals its significance and character. It is an indispensable foundation for the moving colors. The painting evokes my feelings again when I listen to the music again. I hear the melodies in my mind when I look at it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anne-salz.nl Anne Salz Website] Accessed 31 Aug 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anne Patterson, a New York-based artist with a background in theatrical set design, describes the genesis of her installation of 20 miles of silk ribbons suspended from the vaulted ceiling arches of [[Grace Cathedral, San Francisco|San Francisco's Grace Cathedral]], which was inspired by a cello performance of [[Bach]]:

{{quotation|When listening to music, I see colors and shapes, either angular or circular, and get a sense of whether the piece is horizontal or vertical. [[Joshua Roman|Joshua's]] piece was all blue and green.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fastcodesign.com/3024639/an-artist-suspends-20-miles-of-ribbon-inside-grace-cathedral&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Brandy Gale, a Santa Cruz, California-based Canadian painter and photographer "experiences an involuntary joining or crossing of any of her senses – hearing, vision, taste, touch, smell and movement. Gale paints from life rather than from photographs and by exploring the sensory panorama of each locale attempts to capture, select, and transmit these personal experiences."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brandygale.com/contact--brandy-gale-2/ Brandy Gale website&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Growing up with this gift, I thought everyone had it. But it turns out that it is not so common, and it took the school psychologist to figure out why the letter "A" was always yellow to me, or the fresh cut grass on the way to school triggered a melody in my head, or why certain shapes had personalities and smells. Artist, Brandy Gale&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brandygale.com/contact--brandy-gale-2/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition to her field work, Gale also paints live, sometimes performing her painting experience live before an audience with musical accompaniment, as she did at the 2013 [http://www.the-eg.com/ EG Conference] in Monterey, CA. with cellist Philip Sheppard,&lt;ref&gt;http://library.fora.tv/2013/04/19/The_Wondrous_Sensory_Spectrum_of_Brandy_Gale EG7 Conference, Monterey, CA&lt;/ref&gt; at the Oakland Garden of Memory in June 2014 with her husband, guitarist and composer [[Henry Kaiser (musician)|Henry Kaiser]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gardenofmemory.com/ Garden of Memory Oakland, CA&lt;/ref&gt; and with Kaiser and guitarist [http://avamendozamusic.com/ Ava Mendoza] at The Stone in NYC.&lt;ref&gt;http://thestonenyc.com/calendar.php?month=0 The Stone NYC&lt;/ref&gt; Gale's 2014 solo exhibition ''Coastal Synaesthesia:Paintings and Photographs of Hawaii, Fiji and California'' was held at Gualala Arts Gallery, Gualala, CA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gualalaarts.org/Exhibits/Gallery/2015-01-Coastal-Synaesthesia.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202215117/http://www.gualalaarts.org/Exhibits/Gallery/2015-01-Coastal-Synaesthesia.html |archivedate=2015-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|There is power, joy, and physical challenge in painting outdoors ''alla prima'', especially for a full spectrum synesthete like Brandy [Gale], whose visions from her 5 fully-crossed senses are transmitted to others through the polychromatic intensity of her ''plein air'' work.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-eg.com/presenters/brandy-gale E.G. Conference presenter biography&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Art meant to evoke synesthetic associations==
[[File:Fantasia theatrical trailer.png|thumb|right|Title screen in the original theatrical trailer]]
Perhaps the most famous work which might be thought to evoke synesthesia-like experiences in a non-synesthete audience is the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] film [[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]], although it is unknown if this was intentional or not.  Another classical example is the use of the [[color organ]] which would project colored lights along with the musical notes, to create a synesthetic experience in the audience (Campen 2007, Jewanski &amp; Sidler 2006).

[[File:Vassily Kandinsky, 1913 - Composition 6.jpg|thumb|250px|''Composition VI'' (1913) by [[Vassily Kandinsky]]|alt=Rectangular, multicolored abstract painting]]
[[Wassily Kandinsky]] working in the 1920s, may not have been a synesthete, despite his fame for his synesthetic artwork. Many of his paintings and stage pieces were based upon a set and established system of correspondences between colors and the timbres of specific musical instruments. Kandinsky himself, however, stated that his correspondences between colors and musical timbres have no "scientific" basis, but were founded upon a combination of his own personal feelings, current prevailing cultural biases, and mysticism ({{Harvnb|Kandinsky|1994}}; {{Harvnb|Dann|1998}}; {{Harvnb|Riccò|1999|pp=138–142}} Jewanski &amp; Sidler 2006, Campen 2007).

==History==
[[File:Giuseppe Arcimboldo - Four Seasons in One Head - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail| Four Seasons in One Head by [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]]]]
The interest in synesthesia is at least as old as Greek philosophy. One of the questions that the classic philosophers asked was if color (chroia, what we now call timbre) of music was a physical quality that could be quantified (Campen 2007, Gage 1994, Ferwerda &amp; Struycken 2001, Jewanski 1999). The first known experiment to test correspondences between sound and color was conducted by the Milanese artist [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]] at the end of the sixteenth century. He consulted with a musician at the court of Rudolph II in Prague to create a new experiment that sought to show the colors that accompany music. He decided to place different colored strips of painted paper on the gravicembalo, a keyboard instrument (Gage, 1994). He was also an artist who created strange portraits from unusual objects, such as ''Four Seasons in One Head''. The problem of finding a mathematical system to explain the connection between music and color has both inspired and frustrated artists and scientists throughout the ages. The seventeenth-century physicist [[Isaac Newton]] tried to solve the problem by assuming that musical tones and color tones have frequencies in common. He attempted to link sound oscillations to respective light waves. According to Newton, the distribution of white light in a spectrum of colors is analogous to the musical distribution of tones in an octave. So, he identified seven discrete light entities, that he then matched to the seven discrete notes of an octave (Campen 2007, Peacock 1988).

===Color organs===
{{Main|Color organ}} 
Inspired by Newton’s theory of music-color correspondences, the French Jesuit Louis-Bertrand Castel designed a color harpsichord (clavecin oculaire) with colored strips of paper which rose above the cover of the harpsichord whenever a particular key was hit (Campen 2007, Franssen 1991). Renowned masters like [[Telemann]] and [[Rameau]] were actively engaged in the development of a clavecins oculaire. The invention of the gas light in the nineteenth century created new technical possibilities for the color organ. In England between 1869 and 1873, the inventor Frederick Kastner developed an organ that he named a Pyrophone. The British inventor Alexander Rimington, a professor in fine arts in London, documented the phrase ‘Colour-Organ’ for the first time in a patent application in 1893. Inspired by Newton’s idea that music and color are both grounded in vibrations, he divided the color spectrum into intervals analogous to musical octaves and attributed colors to notes. The same notes in a higher octave produced the same color tone but then in a lighter value (Peacock 1988). Around the turn of the century, concerts with light and musical instruments were given quite regularly. As most technical problems had been conquered, the psychological questions concerning the effects of these performances came to the fore. The Russian composer [[Alexander Scriabin]] was particularly interested in the psychological effects on the audience when they experienced sound and color simultaneously. His theory was that when the correct color was perceived with the correct sound, ‘a powerful psychological resonator for the listener’ would be created. His most famous synesthetic work, which is still performed today, is Prometheus, Poem of Fire. On the score of Prometheus, he wrote next to the instruments separate parts for the tastiere per luce, the color organ (Campen 2007, Galeyev 2001, Gleich 1963).

===Musical paintings===
In the second half the nineteenth century, a tradition of musical paintings began to appear that influenced symbolist painters (Campen 2007, Van Uitert 1978). In the first decades of the twentieth century, a German artist group called The Blue Rider ([[Der Blaue Reiter]]) executed synesthetic experiments that involved a composite group of painters, composers, dancers and theater producers. The group focused on the unification of the arts by means of "Total Works of Art" ([[Gesamtkunstwerk]]) (Von Maur 2001, Hahl-Koch 1985, Ione 2004). [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]'s theory of synesthesia, as formulated in the booklet "Concerning the Spiritual in Art" (1910), helped to shape the ground for these experiments. He described synesthesia as a phenomenon of transposition of experience from one sense modality to another, as in unisonous musical tones (Kandinsky 1910, Düchting 1996). Kandinsky was not the only artist at this time with an interest in synesthetic perception. A study of the art at the turn of the century reveals in the work of almost every progressive or avant-garde artist an interest in the correspondences of music and visual art. Modern artists experimented with multi-sensory perception like the simultaneous perception of movement in music and film (Von Maur 2001, Heyrman 2003).

===Visual music===
{{Main|Visual music}} 
Starting in the late 1950s, electronic music and electronic visual art have co-existed in the same digital medium (Campen 2007, Collopy 2000, Jewanski &amp; Sidler 2006, Moritz 2003). Since that time, the interaction of these fields of art has increased tremendously. Nowadays, students of art and music have digital software at their disposal that uses both musical and visual imagery. Given the capability of the Internet to publish and share digital productions, this has led to an enormous avalanche of synesthesia-inspired art on the Internet (Campen 2007) (cf. website RhythmicLight.com on the history of visual music). For instance, [[Stephen Malinowski]] and Lisa Turetsky from Berkeley, California wrote a software program, entitled the [http://www.musanim.com/mam/mamsoft.htm Music Animation Machine], that translates and shows music pieces in colored measures.

===Synesthetic artists===
With today’s knowledge and testing apparatus, it can be determined with more certainty if contemporary artists are synesthetic. By interviewing these artists, one gets some insights into the process of painting music (cf. Steen, Smilack, Salz). The lines of artistic explorations of synesthesia and scientific research into the subject have become closely intertwined in the last decade. Some contemporary artists are active members of synesthesia associations in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium and other countries (cf. Arte Citta) [http://www.artecitta.es]. In and outside these associations that house scientists and artists, the exchange of ideas and collaborations between artists and scientists has grown rapidly in the last decades (cf. the Leonardo online bibliography Synesthesia in Art and Science) [http://lbs.mit.edu/isast/spec.projects/synesthesiabib.html], and this is only a small selection of synesthetic work in the arts. New artistic projects on synesthesia are appearing every year. These painters, sculptors, designers and musicians have shown to be well-informed on the latest scientific insights in synesthesia. They combine this scientific knowledge and personal intuition in a range of artistic expressions. For instance they capture their synesthetic perceptions in painting, photographs, textile work, and sculptures. Beside these ‘classical’ materials of making art, an even larger production of synesthesia-inspired works is noticed in the field of digital art (Campen 2007).

'''''The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night''''' (1885), subtitled '''''A Plain and Literal Translation of the Arabian Nights Entertainments''''', is an English language translation of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (the “Arabian Nights”) – a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian stories and folk tales compiled in Arabic during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (8th−13th centuries) – by the British explorer and [[Arabist]] [[Richard Francis Burton]] (1821–1890). It stood as the only complete translation of the Macnaghten or Calcutta II edition (Egyptian recension) of the "Arabian Nights" until the Malcolm C. and Ursula Lyons translation in 2008.

Burton's translation was one of two unabridged and unexpurgated English translations done in the 1880s; the first was by [[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]], under the title ''The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night'' (1882–84, nine volumes). Burton's ten volume version was published almost immediately afterward with a slightly different title. This, along with the fact that Burton closely advised Payne and partially based his books on Payne's, led later to charges of [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sallis, Eva (1999), ''Scheherazade Through the Looking-Glass: The Metamorphosis of the Thousand and One Nights'' (Routledge),  pg 4 and ''[[passim]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclo&gt;Marzolph, Ulrich and Richard van Leeuwen. 2004. ''The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia'', Volume 1, pp 506–508.&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the [[Human sexuality|sexual]] imagery in the source texts (which Burton made a special study of, adding extensive footnotes and appendices on "Oriental" sexual mores)&lt;ref name=encyclo/&gt; and to the strict [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] laws on obscene material, both translations were printed as private editions for subscribers only, rather than being published in the usual manner. Burton's original ten volumes were followed by a further six entitled '''''The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night''''' (1886–88). Burton's 16 volumes, while boasting many prominent admirers, have been criticised for their "archaic language and extravagant idiom" and "obsessive focus on sexuality"; they have even been called an "eccentric ego-trip" and a "highly personal reworking of the text".&lt;ref name=encyclo/&gt; His voluminous and obscurely detailed notes and appendices have been characterised as “obtrusive, kinky and highly personal”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Irwin (writer)|Irwin, Robert]] (1994), "The Arabian Nights: A Companion", Allen Lane: The Penguin Press, pg 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) began naming features on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] after characters and places in Burton's translation&lt;ref name="NameCategories"&gt;Blue, J.; (2006) [http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append6.html ''Categories for Naming Planetary Features'']. Retrieved 16 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; because “its surface is so strange and mysterious that it was given the ''Arabian Nights'' as a name bank, linking fantasy landscape with a literary fantasy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/static/publications/IB104.pdf |title=Data |website=www.iau.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[List of geological features on Enceladus]].)

==Background==
Burton – an accomplished [[geographer]], explorer, [[oriental studies|orientalist]], [[ethnologist]], diplomat, [[linguistics|polylinguist]] and author – was best known in his lifetime for travelling in disguise to [[Mecca]] (1853) and for journeying (with [[John Hanning Speke]]) as the first European to visit the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] of Africa in search of the source of the [[Nile river|Nile]] (1857–58). One of the great Arabists of his day, he had long wanted to publish an unexpurgated version of the "Arabian Nights" stories. The first translations into English, notably that by [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]] (1840, 1859), were highly abridged and heavily [[bowdlerised]], which irritated Burton.

In 1863 Burton co-founded the ''[[Anthropological Society of London]]'' with Dr. [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]]. In Burton's own words, the main aim of the society (through the publication of the periodical ''Anthropologia'') was "to supply travelers with an organ that would rescue their observations from the outer darkness of manuscript and print their curious information on social and sexual matters". Burton had written numerous travel books which invariably included sexual curiosa in extensive footnotes and appendices. His best-known contributions to literature were those considered risqué or even pornographic at the time and which were published under the auspices of the "Kama Shastra Society", a fictitious organisation created by Burton and [[Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot]] as a legal device to avoid the consequences of [[Obscene Publications Act 1857|current obscenity laws]]. (Burton and Arbuthnot were the only members of the "Society".) These works included ''The [[Kama Sutra]] of Vatsyayana'' (1883), published just before his ''Nights'', and ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden of the Shaykh Nefzawi]]'' (1886), published just after it.

The volumes were printed by the Kama Shastra Society in a subscribers-only edition of one thousand with a guarantee that there would never be a larger printing of the books in this form. To confound possible litigation, the title pages claimed the printing had been done in "[[Benares]]", but this was a subterfuge. In reality, it was done by Miller &amp; Richard (a Scottish firm) at Stoke Newington.&lt;ref&gt;Penzer, ''Op. cit.'', pg 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

===The stories===
{{Main|List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights}}

===Sexology===
The stories collected in the ''Nights'' are often sexual in content and were considered pornography at the time of Burton's publication. The ''Terminal Essay'' in volume 10 of Burton's ''Nights'' contains a 14,000-word section entitled "Pederasty" (Volume 10, section IV, D). Here Burton postulated that male homosexuality was prevalent in an area of the southern latitudes named by him the "[[Sotadic zone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Richard Francis Burton Explorer of the Sotadic Zone|url=http://paganpressbooks.com/jpl/BURTON.HTM|work=Pagan Press|publisher=Pagan Press|accessdate=16 June 2012|author=Pagan Press|year=1982–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Rumors about Burton's own sexuality and experiences were already circulating and were further incited by this work.)

==Plagiarism controversy==
{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
John Payne and Burton collaborated on their respective translations of the ''Nights'' for more than half a decade, and each respected the other's scholarship, but Payne believed that Burton had plagiarised his manuscripts when he sent them to Trieste to be checked.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, Mary S. (1998), ''A Rage to Live: A Biography of Richard and Isabel Burton'', New York/London: [[W.W. Norton]], pg 795.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, a biographer of Burton, [[Thomas Wright (biographer)|Thomas Wright]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Thomas|title=The Life of Sir Richard Burton|publisher=[[G. P. Putnam's Sons]]|location=New York|year=1906|volume=Vols. 1 and 2|url=http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/burton/richard/b97zw/|isbn=1-4264-1455-2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013141137/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/burton/richard/b97zw/|archivedate=13 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the claim that Burton had plagiarised most of his translation from Payne. Burton's most recent biographer summarises the situation as follows.&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Wright] made a comparison of the respective versions of the ''Nights'' by Burton and Payne. We know, not only from Richard's and Isabel's writings but from the statements of people who met him through the years, that Burton had been collecting manuscripts of the ''Nights'' stories and translating them, on and off, for over twenty-five years before he met Payne. So Wright's claim that Burton had not done his own translation, but had "taken from Payne at least three-quarters of his entire work", is extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, ''Op. cit'', pp 795–796.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Norman Mosley Penzer]], in his 1923 ''Annotated Bibliography'' of Burton's works, takes great umbrage at "Wright's futile efforts to glorify Payne and scoff at Burton",&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Mosley Penzer|Penzer, Norman Mosley]] (1923), ''An Annotated Bibliography of Sir Richard Francis Burton'', London: A. M. Philpot, pg 319.&lt;/ref&gt; contradicting several of his examples point by point. In Burton's defence, Penzer asserts that it is usual for translators to study and follow in the footsteps of earlier translators and cites examples of similarities in the stories Payne translated {{em|after}} Burton had published his version.

The "plagiarism" allegation is also examined in detail in an appendix to [[Fawn Brodie]]’s 1967 biography of Burton, ''The Devil Drives''.

==Style==
In translating the ''Nights'', Burton attempted to invent an English equivalent of medieval Arabic. In doing so, he drew upon [[Middle English|Chaucerian English]], [[Elizabethan English]], and the 1653 English translation by Sir [[Thomas Urquhart]] of the first three books of [[Rabelais]]'s ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' (1532-46).&lt;ref&gt;[[A.S. Byatt|Byatt, A.S.]] (1999), "Narrate or Die: Why Scheherazade Keeps on Talking", ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' (18 April issue).&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to British historian and Arabist [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Burton shared [John] Payne's enthusiasm for archaic and forgotten words. The style Burton achieved can be described as a sort of composite mock-Gothic, combining elements from [[Middle English]], the [[Authorized Version of the Bible]] and [[Jacobean drama]]. Most modern readers will also find Burton's Victorian vulgarisms jarring, for example ‘regular [[:wikt:Joe Miller|Joe Millers]]’, ‘[[:wikt:Charley|Charleys]]’, and ‘[[:wikt:red cent|red cent]]’. Burton's translation of the ''Nights'' can certainly be recommended to anyone wishing to increase their word-power:  ‘[[:wikt:chevisance|chevisance]]’, ‘[[:wikt:fortalice|fortalice]]’, ‘[[:wikt:kemper|kemperly]]’, ‘[[:wikt:cark|cark]]’, ‘[[:wikt:foison|foison]]’, ‘[[:wikt:soothfast|soothfast]]’, ‘[[:wikt:perlection|perlection]]’, ‘[[:wikt:wittol|wittol]]’, ‘[[:wikt:parergon|parergon]]’, ‘[[:wikt:brewis|brewis]]’, ‘bles’, ‘[[:wikt:fadaise|fadaise]]’, ‘[[:wikt:coelebs|coelebs]]’, ‘[[:wikt:vivisepulture|vivisepulture]]’, and so on. ‘[[:wikt:whilome|Whilome]]’ and ‘[[:wikt:anent|anent]]’ are standard in Burton's vocabulary. The range of vocabulary is wider and stranger than Payne's, lurching between the erudite and the plain earthy, so that [[Harun al-Rashid]] and [[Sinbad]] walk and talk in a linguistic [[Never Never Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, ''[[Op. cit.]]'' pg 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
Many early commentators on Burton's ''Nights'' criticised his eccentric "mixture of obsolete words, mediaeval phrases, modern slang, Americanisms, and foreign words and expressions".&lt;ref&gt;Penzer, ''Op. cit.'', pg 319.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge Luis Borges]], however, wrote a celebrated essay on “The Translators of ''The Thousand and One Nights''”&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Borges, Jorge Luis (1999), ''Selected Non-Fictions'', Editor: [[Eliot Weinberger]]; Translators: [[Esther Allen]], [[Suzanne Jill Levine]], and Eliot Weinberger; New York: [[Viking Press|Viking]], pp 92–109. (This essay was originally published in 1936 as "Los traductores de las 1001 Noches" in ''Eternidad''.)&lt;/ref&gt; in which – while he chastises Burton for his distortions and "indulgent loitering" — he allows that “the problems that Burton resolved are innumerable”&lt;ref&gt;Borges, ''[[Op. cit.]]'', pg 99&lt;/ref&gt; and delights in his careful use of an extravagantly exotic vocabulary in which each word "is indubitably the ''[[Wikt:mot juste#English|mot juste]]''." In summarising his use of language, Borges concluded that “In some way, the almost inexhaustible process of English is adumbrated in Burton – [[John Donne]]’s hard obscenity, the gigantic vocabularies of [[Shakespeare]] and [[Cyril Tourneur]], [[Swinburne]]’s affinity for the archaic, the crass erudition of the authors of 17th century chapbooks, the energy and imprecision, the love of tempests and magic.”&lt;ref&gt;Borges, ''Op. cit.'', pg 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==

===Original publication===
[[File:TitlePage Burton's Nights.jpg|thumb|Title page of Volume I of the original edition.]]
*''A Plain and Literal Translation of the Arabian Nights' Entertainments, Now Entituled ''[sic]'' The Book of The Thousand Nights and a Night; With Introduction Explanatory Notes on the Manners and Customs of Moslem Men and a Terminal Essay upon the History of the Nights by Richard F. Burton''; Benares:&lt;ref&gt;Of course claiming the printing had been done in "Benares" was a subterfuge. In reality, it was done by Miller &amp; Richard (a Scottish firm) at [[Stoke Newington]]. See Penzer, ''Op. cit.'', pg 135.&lt;/ref&gt; MDCCCLXXXV: Printed by the Kamashastra Society for Private Subscribers Only.

**Supplemental series of 1886–88 in six volumes. No illustrations.
*An identical 'Burton Club' London edition of 1000 individually numbered sets of 17 volumes dated 1885-8 was also published, dedicated by Burton to the great Shakespearean actor [[Henry Irving]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Lady Burton's edition===
[[File:Lady Burton's Edition.jpg|thumb|Title page of Volume I of ''Lady Burton's Edition of Her Husband's Arabian Nights''.]]
*''Lady Burton's Edition of Her Husband's Arabian Nights Translated Literally from the Arabic'' (1886-1887); Prepared for Household Reading by [[Justin Huntly McCarthy]], M.P.; 6 vols.; London: Waterlow &amp; Sons, Limited, London Wall. 

:This edition is ostensibly the “family” version of Burton's translation. (In her "Preface", [[Lady Burton]] guarantees that "no mother shall regret her girl's reading this Arabian Nights".) It is a much bowdlerized version of the original edition and was not a commercial success. It excises 215 of the original 3,215 pages, including Burton's defense of ''[[turpiquilum]]'' in his "Foreword", all sexually explicit commentary, and the two final essays on "Pornography" and "Pederasty."&lt;ref&gt;Colligan, Collette (2002), [https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/special/endsandbeginnings/28.2.colligan.pdf  “Esoteric Pornography”: Sir Richard Burton’s Arabian Nights and the Origins of Pornography”]; ''[[Victorian Review]]'', Vol. 28, No. 2, pp 31-64. Published by [[Victorian Studies Association of Western Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Burton merely lent her name to this expurgated edition. As she stated before his death, "I have never read, nor do I intend to read, at his own request, and to be true to my promise to him, my husband's 'Arabian Nights' ".

===Nichols/Smithers reprints===
*1894 [[H.S. Nichols &amp; Co]], London, edition by [[Leonard C. Smithers]], 12 Volumes; this reprint "omits given passages in dreadful taste, whose elimination will be mourned by no one".
*1897 H.S. Nichols &amp; Co, London, "Illustrated Library Edition", 12 Volumes (142 original illustrations, including a portrait of Burton, reproduced from the original pictures in oils specially painted by [[Albert Letchford]] with one set of the original 71 illustrations presented as included by the publisher and another set individually hand-coloured.)

:Nichols' second printing is a scarce and handsome edition, the first to include the illustrations by Letchford. In 1896, two years after their first edition of Burton's ''Nights'', the Nichols-Smithers duo commissioned Burton's close friend, Albert Letchford, to paint 65 illustrations for another edition as well as a portrait of Burton, and soon after commissioned for five more. Burton and Letchford had met several years before when the latter was 18 and in [[Florence]] beginning his art education. They discussed the possibility of illustrating the ''Nights''. Burton's suggestion of illustrating the ''Nights'' had appealed greatly to Letchford on account of the unlimited scope such a subject would give to an artist who loved the East and had a boundless imagination. Letchford commenced study of Eastern images for his paintings, though only one of the illustrations was painted in Burton's lifetime.

===American editions===
'''“Burton Society” edition:'''
*''Alf Laylah Wa Laylah, The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night'', by Richard F. Burton; Press of the Carson-Harper Company, Denver, Colo., 1900–01. “For private subscribers only.” Includes 100 illustrations by [[Stanley L. Wood]]. (This was the first reprint of the original unexpurgated edition and the best reprint for many decades. This edition is the one used by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] for naming features on [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/References “Sources of Planetary Names”] @ the IAU website; the webpage has "Larsen" for "Carson", but this is an error.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the last three volumes (4, 5, and 6 of the ''Supplemental Nights'') are dated 1901. The edition was a commercial failure.)

'''“Burton Club” editions:'''
:The [[Electrotyping|electro]]s from the "Burton Society" edition were acquired by the "Burton Club" — “the ''nom de plume'' of a certain Boston publisher”, according to N.C. Penzer.&lt;ref&gt;Penzer, ''Op. cit.'', pg 126.&lt;/ref&gt; This very successful series of editions probably began in 1903 (none of the volumes bear dates) and continued for many decades. There are 114 illustrations by various (at least 13) English and French artists. Many of these are uncredited and many are from other (some pre-Burton) editions of the ''Nights'', some even having nothing to do with the ''Nights'' or even the Middle East. (All of Letchford's works from the Nichols/Smithers edition are there, except the portrait of Burton.).&lt;ref&gt;Penzer, ''Op. cit.'', pg 127–130.&lt;/ref&gt; Penzer's bibliography lists nine different Burton Club editions; after about 1905 each was named after a city (Benares, Mecca, Medinah, Aden, Baghdad, Samara, Bassorah, Shammar, and Luristan), a new one appearing about every two years. Penzer called these the "Catch Word" editions and there are known to be at least 6 others (Teheran, Baroda, etc). These editions were made semi-surreptitiously up through the 1920s and many may have been printed in the US, but bound in the UK. There exists no definitive list of all "Burton Club" editions or their sequence. According to Penzer, the "Illustrated Benares" edition was the first.

===Later reprint editions===

'''''The Steve Harvey Show''''' is a sitcom that aired on [[The WB]] from August 25, 1996 to February 17, 2002. It was created by [[Winifred Hervey]] and directed by [[Stan Lathan]].

==Synopsis==
Steve Hightower ([[Steve Harvey]]) is a 1970s [[funk]] legend who is now a music teacher/vice-principal at [[Booker T. Washington]] High School on [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]'s West Side. Budget cutbacks meant Steve also had to teach drama and art, much to his surprise. Cedric Robinson ([[Cedric the Entertainer]]) is a coach at the high school, and Steve's longtime best friend. The principal of Booker T. Washington High is Steve's former classmate, Regina Grier ([[Wendy Raquel Robinson]]), who Steve affectionately calls "Piggy", because of the fact that she was overweight as an adolescent.

Steve forms a strong bond with two of his students: Romeo Santana ([[Merlin Santana]]), a stylish, popular, self-absorbed ladies' man, and the equally vacuous Stanley Kuznocki, nicknamed Bullethead ([[William Lee Scott]]) - acting as their mentor, and gradually, accepts them as friends.

In 1997, the show introduced a new character, a secretary named Lovita Jenkins ([[Terri J. Vaughn]]), a woman who is fundamentally good in nature, but nonetheless, considerably unrefined in terms of disposition. Cedric and Lovita begin dating, and eventually marry and produce a child. The show also featured a succession of young actresses who served as female foils to Romeo and Bullethead; the longest-lasting of these was [[Lori Beth Denberg]] as the overachieving, socially inept Lydia Gutman.She would also call Bullethead a "broke [[Brad Pitt]]" whenever he annoyed her, but would usually refer to Lydia as "Linda", "Lisa", or "Lucy" (correctly calling her "Lydia" only once). Rapper [[The Lady of Rage]] also had a recurring role as Coretta "The Ox" Cox, a physically massive, brutish teenaged girl in romantic pursuit of Romeo. 

Steve was part of a fictional singing group called "Steve Hightower and the High Tops," who would temporarily reunite to perform on occasion (the spelling of "High Tops" appears on a promotional poster that hangs on Steve's wall). The members consisted of Steve, T-Bone (played by [[T. K. Carter]], later by [[Don Curry|Don 'D.C.' Curry]]), Pretty Tony (played by [[Ronald Isley]] of [[The Isley Brothers]]), and Clyde (played by Jonathan Slocumb). Two of their signature songs (performed several times on the show) were "When the Funk Hits the Fan" (and later on [[Steve Harvey (talk show)|Harvey's eponymous talk show]]), and "Break Me Off a Piece of That Funk."  Though Cedric was not an original member of the group, he usually sang with them on several events.

A few other recurring characters throughout the series included Cedric's grandmother named "Grandma Puddin'" (played by Cedric the Entertainer) and Regina's boyfriend, former NFL star Warrington Steele (played by [[Dorien Wilson]]). [[Kenan Thompson]] and [[Kel Mitchell]] appeared in several episodes as "Junior" and "Vincent."  [[Wayne Wilderson]] portrayed Byron, a "bougie" type character who was a TV producer and a member of the Onyx Club (a professional men's group that Steve and Cedric tried to join). Dwayne Adway played Jordan Maddox, a professional basketball player who was briefly married to Regina before dying during their honeymoon. [[Ernest Lee Thomas]] made a couple of appearances as the Reverend who eulogized Maddox, and who married Cedric and Lovita.

==Running gags==
There were a few recurrent gags throughout the series. For instance, Lovita had several relatives named after products or items (her brother's name was [[Duracell]]; she had cousins named "[[Kinko]]", "[[Bruschetta]]," "[[Clinique]]," and "[[Camay]]").

Steve also made several references to his well-known hot spot "The Nasty Kitty" and his favorite working girl, Bubblicious, even though the strip club is never seen. Steve's topical humor of popular culture was also another recurring gag. One example of these jokes: "When I see that woman, I'm like [[Shaquille O'Neal|Shaq]] doing [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] - I just don't know how to act!". Another recurring gag on the show was despite being a one-time famous musician in the universe of the show, Steve was always mistaken for being other famous musicians. For example, in an episode guest starring [[Jerry Springer]], he refers to him as "That Cop from the [[Village People]]." Another episode featured singer [[Teena Marie]], who when Steve went to introduce himself to see if she'd remember him, answers "Oh yes! Lionel! How are you? Give my best to the rest of [[The Commodores]]" (referring to singer [[Lionel Richie]]).

Though Regina had blossomed into a beautiful, stylish lady, she sometimes displayed her insecurities, and was highly competitive (always displayed childlike exuberance whenever she won a trophy by yelling her signature catchphrase "Bam! In your face!", and once cheated Steve in a game of [[Scrabble]] because he played it better than she). In addition, the romantic tension between Steve and Regina eventually blossomed into a relationship, though they never kissed on the show.

A very well-known gag was Cedric's story about being from Willacoochee, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], where he was raised in a one-bedroom shack. The story was never finished, the scene would change or someone would interrupt him. Cedric's love for decking out his [[Hyundai]], which was never seen in the show, was another running gag, as well as offering to take Lovita out to dinner whenever he had a two-for-one coupon at the [[Sizzler]] restaurant.

Occasional gags referenced Bullethead's trailer park lifestyle, and Romeo's numerous names (he has used the names Romeo Miguel Jesus Pele Rojas Alejandro Santana). In one episode, he wrote all of his names on paper but never prepared his assignment, resulting in an "F". Lydia almost always displayed an obsession for her classmate/alleged lover, Arthur Rabinowitz (whom Steve referred to as "that polite Jewish boy that does his taxes"), and for her favorite entertainer, [[Barbra Streisand]]; however, she had total disdain for classmates "Heather the cheerleader" and "Jennifer the cheerleader". One other gag was that teachers would refer to a student (amongst themselves) because of a condition or appearance ("Helmet Boy" for wearing a special helmet in gym class; "Au Natural Girl" for having a strong body odor, and "Firestarter" for one kid who kept setting items on fire).

==Series end==
In 2001, Harvey decided to pursue other projects. He wished to end the show after the fifth season, but at the insistence of the WB network, reluctantly filmed a 13-episode sixth season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_13_101/ai_84184937?tag=content;col1|title=`The Steve Harvey Show' ends after six seasons|date=March 18, 2002|publisher=''Jet''|accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series ended with Regina mulling over a job offer to be a principal at a private school in California. Steve, who doesn't want Regina to go, acts supportive despite his feelings. Regina ends up taking the job; with encouragement from Lydia, Bullethead, and Romeo, Steve decides to go after her to reveal his true feelings. Lydia, Romeo, and Bullethead have all graduated by the series' finale. Meanwhile, Cedric and Lovita win the lottery and Lovita goes into labor (Terri J. Vaughn's real-life pregnancy was written into the show that season).

===Death of Merlin Santana===
On November 9, 2002, nine months after the show ended, Merlin Santana was shot in the head and killed while sitting in his friend's ([[Brandon Adams (actor)|Brandon Adams]]) car in [[South Central Los Angeles]], [[California]]. He was 26 years old. The reason for his death is that the killer's girlfriend falsely stated that Santana tried to rape her. The episode of ''The Steve Harvey Show'' immediately following Santana's death was dedicated to his honor.

==Syndication==
The series was first distributed to syndication to [[The WB]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]], [[UPN]], and independent affiliates in the United States by [[Columbia TriStar Television|Columbia Tristar Television Distribution]]  in September 2000, and remained airing in broadcast syndication in some U.S. markets on various local stations (such as [[WCIU-TV|WCIU]] and [[Me-TV]] in Chicago) as late as 2008. From 2000-2005, reruns aired on New York's UPN station, [[WWOR-TV]]. From 2014 to June 2016, after [[Bill Cosby]]'s rape allegation, ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' reruns were replaced on [[WPIX]] by reruns of ''The Steve Harvey Show''. The show has started airing again in syndication as of 2015.

The series aired on [[BET]] until March 2009, and was on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] in the [[United States]] until September 24, 2011, UK Channel [[Trouble (TV channel)|Trouble]]. It was broadcast on [[Ion Television]] until March 16, 2009.

As of June 2018, reruns of the show can be seen on [[BET Her]].

==DVD release==
In 2003, [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment| Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment]] released ''The Best of the Steve Harvey Show, Vol. 1'', on [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] DVD. The disc features five episodes of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Best-Steve-Harvey-Show-Vol/dp/B000095WW5|title=''The Best of the Steve Harvey Show, Vol. 1''|publisher=Amazon.com|accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Timeline of fictional stories about the ''Mona Lisa''}}

&lt;!--- Don't mess with this line! ---&gt;&lt;!--- Write your article below this line ---&gt;

Here below is a '''[[chronology]]''' of [[fiction]]al and [[Fiction#Semi-fiction|semi-fictional]] stories (including films, episodes in TV series, as well as literary works)  that revolve, either wholly or partially, around the famous ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', a portrait of [[Lisa del Giocondo]] painted by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] during the [[Renaissance]] in [[Florence]]. The years listed on the left refer to the year of release of these works of fiction.

== 1970s ==
*1975 - ''[[The Second Mrs. Giaconda]]'', a novel by [[E. L. Konigsburg]] exploring how the portrait came to be painted.
*1979 - The episode "[[City of Death]]", from the long running TV series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', centres around a scheme of stealing the ''Mona Lisa'' from the [[Louvre]]. The ''Mona Lisa'' featured again several times in subsequent ''Doctor Who'' stories that were released from year 2001 onwards.

== 1980s ==
*1985 - The adaptation of Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s ''[[The Final Problem]]'' in the television series ''[[Sherlock Holmes (1984 TV series)|Sherlock Holmes]]'' by [[Granada Television]], also centres around a scheme involving the theft of the ''Mona Lisa'' from the Louvre. The scheme, however, is the creation of the screenwriters who dramatised the episode for TV, and is not in actual fact part of the original Conan Doyle story written in 1893.

== 2000s ==
* 2003 - ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'', a novel by [[Dan Brown]]. The ''Mona Lisa'' is an integral part of the plot, and this is underlined by the fact that the ''Mona Lisa'' itself has been used to grace the cover of this best-selling novel.
* 2006 - ''[[I, Mona Lisa]]'', a historical novel by [[Jeanne Kalogridis]] about Lisa del Giocondo
* 2008 - ''[[The Smile (book)|The Smile]]'', a historical novel by [[Donna Jo Napoli]] about Lisa del Giocondo

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5651">{{for|the present company of the same name|Washington National Opera}}
The '''Washington National Opera Association''',&lt;ref name="Matz"&gt;Phillips-Matz, pp. 13/15&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 1919 as '''Washington Community Opera''', was a low-budget opera company, comprising professional principals supported by amateurs, active in [[Washington, DC]] until 1936.

It was in no way related to the company of the same name. By 1921 it had changed its name to the "Washington National Opera Association".&lt;ref name="Matz"/&gt;

==History==
Its founder and moving force was a minor [[baritone]] who was born in [[Canada]] as Thomas Harold Meek but who adopted the name Edouard Albion upon settling in Washington and establishing a voice studio. Meek recruited soprano [[Enrica Clay Dillon]] to serve as the company's first Artistic Director, a role she held from 1919-1927.&lt;ref name=meek&gt;McPherson, Jim, "Mr. Meek Goes to Washington: The Story of the Small-Potatoes Canadian Baritone Who Founded America’s 'National' Opera," ''The Opera Quarterly'', volume 20, no. 2, Spring 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The company offered a wide range of works during its first year, beginning with a January 13, 1919 performance of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and continuing, at intervals throughout the next several months, with [[Michael William Balfe]]'s ''[[The Bohemian Girl]]''; [[George Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]''; [[Ruggero Leoncavallo]]'s ''[[Pagliacci]]''; and [[Charles Gounod]]'s ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', which marked the conductorial debut with the company of [[Arnold Volpe]].  The first production to feature significant professional singers was a ''[[Carmen]]'' in February 1920 with two European veterans, Belgian soprano Marguerita Sylva and Czech tenor Otakar Marák.  Other important singers who would appear with the company in succeeding years included [[Mabel Garrison]], [[Ruby (Jeanne) Gordon|Jeanne Gordon]], [[Louise Homer]], [[Edith Mason]], [[Pasquale Amato]], George Baklanov, [[Edward Johnson (opera singer)|Edward Johnson]], Giuseppi Danise, and [[Titta Ruffo]].&lt;ref name=meek/&gt;

In the course of its more than 90 performances, the company was responsible for several accomplishments all out of proportion with its modest status.  In 1925, it trumped the Chicago Opera in court to offer [[Feodor Chaliapin]]'s first Washington operatic performance, and it also featured the operatic debut of [[John Charles Thomas]]. This took place in the new National Opera House located at 19th and [[E Street]]s.

A year later, it would present the first performances of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Queen of Spades (opera)|Queen of Spades]]'' in Russian by an established US opera company. These were also the first performances by such a company in any language since the work's American premiere at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in German some 16 years before.  In the Washington production, [[Dmitri Alexeievich Smirnov|Dmitri Smirnov]] gave what were probably his sole American performances after his departure from the Metropolitan in 1912.

Later that year, Romanian conductor [[George Georgescu]] stepped in for [[Jacques Alexandria Samossoud|Jacques Samossoud]], who had left the company over a contract dispute, to make his sole appearance in a US opera pit.&lt;ref name=meek/&gt; At the time, Georgescu was more celebrated for having recently taken over the remainder of the [[New York Philharmonic|Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra of New York]]'s season from an ailing [[Arturo Toscanini]].&lt;ref name=Fani&gt;[http://souvenirsdescarpates.blogspot.com/2007/12/george-georgescu.html Alain Chotil-Fani: ''Danube to Bucharest'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, in a 1928 ''[[Die Walküre]]'', [[Johanna Gadski]] performed in an American opera production for the first time since her departure from the Metropolitan more than a decade earlier owing to anti-German sentiment during [[World War I]].  The Washington company in the same year presented the American premiere of [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]'s ''[[Hugh the Drover]]'' under [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]] with [[Tudor Davies]], creator of the role of Hugh.  The company's penultimate performance, a 1936 production of [[Léo Delibes]]'s ''[[Lakmé]]'', marked the US debut of [[Bidu Sayão]], although after a fractious dispute with the orchestra players, the performance was accompanied by a portable organ.&lt;ref name=meek/&gt;

With the coming of the Depression and the limitations of the National Opera House, the company used it fairly infrequently, and it dissolved during the period.&lt;ref name="Matz"/&gt; Limited opera was performed in Washington until the 1950s, except open-air summer performances beside the [[Potomac River]] or in [[Rock Creek Park]]'s [[Carter Barron Amphitheatre]]. Performances in the latter venue lasted for twenty seasons, and included, on 8 July 1965, one by the young tenor [[Plácido Domingo]], partnered by mezzo-soprano [[Rosalind Elias]], in ''Carmen''.&lt;ref name="Matz"/&gt;

[[File:Master Clam Catches a Shrimp.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Master Clam catching a Shrimp. Southern Song Dynasty, mid-13th century. Property of the Freer Sackler Gallery.]]
'''Xianzi''' ({{zh|t=蜆子}}), or '''Kensu''' in Japanese, also known as the Shrimp Eater, was a semi-historical [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]]/[[Zen]] monk, considered to be one of the “scattered sages,” who were deviant or otherwise unusual figures within the Chan tradition. Infamous for his iconoclastic breaking of the taboo on eating meat set forth in the [[Vinaya|Vinaya Code]] of monastic rules, the Shrimp Eater appears in several traditional Zen paintings as both a comedic figure that underscores the Zen tradition of humor, as well as an eccentric, enlightened individual.

== Sources ==
Most information on Xianzi comes from the ''[[Transmission of the Lamp]]'', a collection of hagiographies (1004-1007 C.E.) intended to highlight the “anti-textualism and iconoclasm of the Chan monks”.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Absconding |date=2009 |publisher=Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology and the Harvard Art Museum |author1=Pellizzi, Francesco |author2=Crow, Thomas |author3=Taws, Richard |author4=Casati, Roberto |isbn=9780873658546 |location=Cambridge, Mass |oclc=319493067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Included within this collection of hagiographies are many nontraditional Chan Buddhist figures, such as Xianzi, who never became patriarchs or abbots on their own, but whose stories were still considered vital for the transmission of Chan teachings. Additional information on Xianzi comes from the poems and inscriptions that monks wrote on paintings of him. One such inscription on a painting of Xianzi by the Japanese painter Josetsu reads:
{{Quote|text=Zen believers say the origin [of all things] is emptiness&lt;br&gt;

== Biography ==
[[File:Buddhist Patriarch Kensu with Shrimp LACMA AC1994.139.1.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|Buddhist Patriarch Kensu with Shrimp. Late 17th Century Japan.]]
It is recorded in the Jing-de Era Record that Xianzi lived in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and was a pupil to [[Dongshan Liangjie]] 洞山良價, the founder of the [[Caodong school|Caodong]] 曹洞, or Sōtō, school of Chan Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Zen : masters of meditation in images and writings |author1=Brinker, Helmut |date=1996 |publisher=Artibus Asiae |author2=Kanazawa, Hiroshi |others=Museum Rietberg |isbn=3907070623 |location=Zürich |oclc=34569329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though he was known to never have taken students of his own or teach the dharma&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Sengai : master Zen painter |author1=Furuta, Shōkin |date=2000 |publisher=Kodansha International |author2=Tsukimura, Reiko |isbn=4770023286 |location=Tokyo |oclc=44059558}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Sengai), Xianzi was renowned for his eccentricities. Specifically, he was known to catch and eat shrimp, clams, and prawns from nearby lakes and streams, despite the Buddhist prohibition against consuming meat. Paradoxically, Xianzi was said to have attained enlightenment a moment after he had caught a shrimp and was preparing himself to consume it. For this reason, he was understood to be an enlightened individual and carrier of the transmission, rather than a degenerate monk and rule breaker.

In addition to his eccentricities regarding the consumption of meat, Xianzi was known as a wanderer, never living in or belonging to an official monastery despite his lineage ties to the founder of one of Chinese preeminent schools of Chan Buddhism. Instead, he preferred to mingle with laypeople, spending most of his days catching his dinner. He did not wear the [[Kasaya (clothing)|elaborate robes]] of a more traditional Chinese monk, instead wearing the same ragged robe during both summer and winter. At night, he slept beneath the paper offerings at the [[White Horse Temple]], much as a homeless would in the modern day. Some have even speculated that he was crazy, although some secondary sources suggest that he was just feigning madness.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Vinaya Code ===
The Vinaya was the set of rules and principles that governed many Buddhist monastic communities. Among these rules were prohibitions against having sexual intercourse, regulations on begging, and an iron-clad ban on eating meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The essentials of the Vinaya tradition |author=Gyōnen, Gishin |date=1995 |publisher=Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research |isbn=0962561894 |location=Berkeley, Calif. |oclc=35978564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monks who broke these rules were said to have committed “[[Parajika|pārājika]],” or the eight misbehaviors and were declared “asaṃvāsa,” which means outside of the Buddhist religious community.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Shayne|date=|title=When and Where Is a Monk No Longer a Monk? On Communion and Communities in Indian Buddhist Monastic Law Codes.|url=|journal=Indo-Iranian Journal|volume=52.2|pages=115–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those deemed outside of the Buddhist religious community were not excommunicated per se, but rather were seen as deviants who were not representative of the tradition that they espoused. As someone who routinely ate fish, Xianzi would have certainly been considered asaṃvāsa under the Vinaya Code. The very paintings of Xianzi violate the Vinaya Code to a certain degree, because scholarship shows that originally, the code prohibited humor and laughter, believing it to be counterproductive to a monk’s serious undertakings.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Other parts of the Vinaya Code insist on humility and poverty. The expensive, elaborate robes of high society were frowned on, and monks were supposed to wear the cast-off rags of society. Additionally, in the late 8th century, the Chan master Bozhang recognized the changing dynamics of monastic life, and created the Bozhang qinggui 百丈淸規, which were additional rules for monastic life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The spirit of Zen : a way of life, work and art in the Far East |author=Watts, Alan |date=1960 |publisher=Grove Press |isbn=0802130569 |edition=1st |location=New York |oclc=8710916}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new rules reformed the ways that monks obtained their food, mandating that monks devote part of their time not just to begging for alms, but instead providing some sort of labor, causing monks to work for their food. Many farms were set up alongside monasteries as a result. Although Xianzi did break some basic Vinaya rules, he also upheld others. His dress is simple and although his consumption of meat may have been blasphemous, he did fulfill the responsibility laid out in the Bozhang qinggui of laboring for his food.

=== Xianzi as a Symbol of Zen Humor ===
[[File:The Shrimp Eater.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|The Shrimp Eater. Hanging scroll with inscription done by the monk-painter Muqi Fachang during mid-13th century China.]]
Humor is thought to be one of the defining elements of Chan/Zen teaching, and that humor is almost certainly reflected in the case of Xianzi. Some argue that Chan/Zen masters used humor as a means of conveying its essential wordless transmission.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In a similar way that [[Mahākāśyapa]] wordlessly received the transmission of the dharma through [[Gautama Buddha|Śākyamuni]] Buddha’s [[Flower Sermon|flower sermon]], so too will those who look upon a humorous Chan/Zen painting wordlessly receive the transmission, provided that they get the joke. Understanding humor requires rigor and training, because humor without full-mindedness is grotesque and meaningless, while full-mindedness without awareness of its limitations is empty. In this way, it is argued that Chan/Zen humor is used to replicate the experience of no-mind that Chan/Zen teachings are based on.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Zen humor, as in the case of Xianzi, is typically irreverent and iconoclastic. The paradox of Xianzi is that even though he shamelessly breaks monastic rules by eating meat, that is the way in which he achieved enlightenment. An inscription on a painting of Xianzi by the Chinese monk-painter [[Muqi Fachang]] 牧溪法常 (ca. 1210-ca. 1279) &lt;s&gt; &lt;/s&gt;alludes to this, reading:
{{Quote|text=Picking up his net at random and dragging it through the mud,&lt;br&gt;
Wading across the water, illicit goods emerge before him&lt;br&gt;
He comes face to face with this troublesome taboo&lt;br&gt;

The Form of no-Form: Reconstructing Huineng in Two Paintings by Liang Kai. Order No. 10599033 University of Oregon, 2017 Ann Arbor ProQuest. 26 Mar. 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This kind of irreverence for Buddhist teachings and traditions is repeated in other figures such as the ebullient [[Budai|Budai/Hotei]] 布袋, known literally as the laughing monk. It is speculated that the reason for Chan/Zen’s strong use of humor is that although Chan/Zen Buddhism held itself as being unique for having received the true transmission in an unbroken lineage from Shakyamuni Buddha, in everyday life there were few things that separated Chan/Zen monks from those of other sects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They frequently lived in the same monasteries, abided by the same rules, and read the same sutras. Humor was used to differentiate Chan/Zen from the rest, because it made fun of the very precepts that all of the other schools adhered to so rigorously. By asserting its iconoclastic side, Chan/Zen teachings professed their true knowledge and possession of the transmission.

=== The Scattered Sages ===
[[File:The Zen Eccentric Zhutou.jpg|thumb|upright|The Zen Eccentric Zhutou (Zhimeng.) Painted in the early 16th century Muromachi Period Japan by Josetsu.]]
Xianzi is one of several traditional Chan/Zen figures known as the “scattered sages,” many of which are depicted with in the same humorous, iconoclastic light. Examples of other Scattered Sages include the laughing monk Budai/Hotei, Tanka 丹霞 the icon burner, the Four Sleepers ([[Hanshan (poet)|Hanshan]] 寒山, [[Shide (monk)|Shide]] 拾得, [[Fenggan]] 豐干, and Fenggan’s tiger,) and Zhimeng 智猛.

Zhimeng in particular bears similarities to Xianzi, because he was a figure famous for eating pig’s heads as his favorite treat, much in the same way that Xianzi favored eating shrimp. As a result of their similarities, it was not uncommon for hanging scrolls of Xianzi and Zhimeng to be exhibited together. The artist Josetsu (1405-1496,) for instance, painted the two individually, but their paintings are strikingly similar and are displayed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collections.artsmia.org/art/122101/the-zen-eccentric-zhutou-right-of-a-pair-of-zhutou-and-xianzi-yogetsu|title=The Zen Eccentric Zhutou|last=|first=|date=|website=The Minneapolis Institute of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars theorize that many of the Scattered Sages actually predate Chan/Zen Buddhism and exist outside of its religious context.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They were absorbed into the Chan/Zen pantheon as a means of co-opting traditional Chinese culture, enhancing Chan/Zen’s cultural appeal and diverting local customs into a Buddhist framework. However, the evidence for this in the case of Xianzi is limited and no hard conclusions can be drawn.

Although his name can be translated as “Master Clam” and in his biography he is said to have eaten both shrimp and clams, Xianzi is always painted holding a shrimp in his hand and never a clam.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, he is frequently painted with his fishing net in one hand to show that he caught his prey himself. His beard is always painted with blurry grey brushstrokes, and although his robes are always relatively simple and never decorated or elaborate, sometimes they more closely resemble the traditional robes of monk, rather than those of a peasant. His humble lifestyle is never drawn into question and his poverty is always made clear. Lastly, all known paintings of Xianzi show him eating shrimp – details of his life outside of his shrimp-eating habit are sometimes alluded to in the inscriptions and poems written at the top of the painting, but they are never explicitly shown.
[[File:The Zen Eccentric Xianzi.jpg|thumb|upright|The Zen Eccentric Xianzi. Painted in the early 16th century Muromachi Period Japan by Josetsu.]]
Much of Xianzi’s iconography remains the same from painting to painting, but there seem to be three general categories of depicting him; in one, Xianzi holds the shrimp above his head with his mouth open as if to eat it, while in the second he holds it in front of his face at eye level, intently examining it. In the former category, Xianzi is also frequently smiling and standing more informally, while in the latter category his posture is more restrained. Although when Xianzi is painted looking at the shrimp with his mouth closed he can either be wearing the robes of a monk or the simpler, more ragged robes of the destitute, he is never painted both with his mouth open to eat the shrimp and the robes of a monk. In those paintings, his dress is not representative of the monastic tradition. The third way in which Xianzi is painted shows him actually fishing, with one shrimp already in his hand to show what exactly he is doing. He is intent on his work and pursues no other activities.

Like many paintings done of the “scattered sages,” all paintings of Xianzi are done in the style of apparition painting. They are monochromatic ink paintings, frequently executed on hanging scrolls. The reason for the dominance of this particular style is that even though most paintings of Xianzi and other Scattered Sages were done by monk painters, it is understood that the audience they were trying to appeal to was the Chinese literati and scholastic community of Song Dynasty China, which preferred the apparition painting style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These paintings were frequently given as gifts to members of the scholar elite, and so they naturally reflected the tastes of their recipients.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
