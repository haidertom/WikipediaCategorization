''' Agricultural marketing ''' is inferred to cover the services involved in moving an [[agricultural]] product from the [[farm]] to the [[consumer]]. It is also the planning, organizing, directing and handling of agricultural produce in such a way as to satisfy the farmer, producer and the consumer. Numerous interconnected activities are involved in doing this, such as planning production, growing and [[harvesting]], [[Food grading|grading]], [[Food packaging|packing and packaging]], transport, [[Food storage|storage]], agro- and [[food processing]], [[Food distribution|distribution]], [[advertising]] and sale. Effectively, the term encompasses the entire range of supply chain operations. However, its key function is to help direct these services, by providing competent and able market information, thereby linking the other operations into an integrated service with targeted outcomes.

==Agricultural marketing development==
[[File:Adjamemarche2.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Congestion at a market in [[Abidjan]]]]
[[Image:Mercado de Xipamanine Maputo Moçambique.png|thumb|right|250px|A typical market in Africa]]
Efforts to develop agricultural marketing have, particularly in developing countries, tended to concentrate on a number of areas, specifically infrastructure development; information provision; training of farmers and traders in marketing and post-harvest issues; and support to the development of an appropriate policy environment. In the past, efforts were made to develop government-run marketing bodies but these have tended to become less prominent over the years.&lt;ref name="AbbottNations1986"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abbott|first1=John Cave|author2=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|title=Marketing Improvement in the Developing World: What Happens and what We Have Learned|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-1I-W3lvIsC&amp;pg=PA3|year=1986|publisher=Food &amp; Agriculture Org.|isbn=978-92-5-101427-1|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agricultural Market infrastructure===
Efficient marketing infrastructure such as [[wholesale marketing|wholesale]], retail and assembly markets and [[Warehouse|storage]] facilities is essential for cost-effective marketing, to minimize [[post-harvest handling|post-harvest losses]] and to reduce health risks. Markets play an important role in [[rural development]], income generation, [[food security]], and developing rural-market linkages. Experience shows that planners need to be aware of how to design markets that meet a community's social and economic needs and how to choose a suitable site for a new market. In many cases sites are chosen that are inappropriate and result in under-use or even no use of the infrastructure constructed. It is also not sufficient just to build a market: attention needs to be paid to how that market will be managed, operated and maintained.&lt;ref name="Tracey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-y4851e.HTM|title=Planning and Designing Rural Markets|author=Tracey-White, John|date=2003|location=Rome|publisher=Food And Agrilculture Organization Of The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/ags/publications/AGSF_WD_24.pdf|title=A guide to upgrading rural agricultural retail markets|author=Marocchino, Cecilia|date=2009|location=Rome|publisher=Food And Agrilculture Organization Of The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural assembly markets are located in production areas and primarily serve as places where farmers can meet with traders to sell their products. These may be occasional (perhaps weekly) markets, such as haat bazaars in India and Nepal, or permanent.&lt;ref name = "Tracey"/&gt; Terminal wholesale markets are located in major metropolitan areas, where produce is finally channelled to consumers through trade between wholesalers and retailers, caterers, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tracey-White John | title= Wholesale markets: Planning and Design Manual|url= http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0521e/t0521e00.htm |publisher=FAO|location= Rome| accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characteristics of [[wholesale market]]s have changed considerably as retailing changes in response to urban growth, the increasing role of supermarkets and increased consumer spending capacity. These changes may require responses in the way in which traditional wholesale markets are organized and managed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Reardon T. | author2= Timmer P.|author3= Berdegue J.|title= The Rapid Rise of Supermarkets in Developing Countries: Induced Organizational, Institutional, and Technological Change in Agrifood Systems|url= https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/6557502.pdf|publisher=electronic Journal of Agricultural and Development Economics|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retail marketing systems in western countries have broadly evolved from traditional street markets through to the modern hypermarket or out-of-town shopping center. In developing countries, there remains scope to improve agricultural marketing by constructing new retail markets, despite the growth of supermarkets, although municipalities often view markets primarily as sources of revenue rather than infrastructure requiring development. Effective regulation of markets is essential. Inside a market, both hygiene rules and revenue collection activities have to be enforced. Of equal importance, however, is the maintenance of order outside the market. Licensed traders in a market will not be willing to cooperate in raising standards if they face competition from unlicensed operators outside who do not pay any of the costs involved in providing a proper service.&lt;ref&gt;Tracey-White, J. [http://www.fao.org/docrep/V8390E/V8390E00.htm] Retail markets planning guide. FAO, Rome, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market information===
{{Main|Marketing information system}}
Efficient [[Market Information Systems|market information]] can be shown to have positive benefits for farmers and traders. Up-to-date information on prices and other market factors enables farmers to negotiate with traders and also facilitates spatial distribution of products from rural areas to towns and between markets.&lt;ref&gt;Aparajita Goyal  [http://www.aeaweb.org/issue.php?journal=APP&amp;volume=2&amp;issue=3], Information, Direct Access to Farmers, and Rural Market Performance in Central India, July 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Most governments in developing countries have tried to provide [[Market Information Systems|market information services]] to farmers, but these have tended to experience problems of sustainability. Moreover, even when they function, the service provided is often insufficient to allow commercial decisions to be made because of time lags between data collection and dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd  [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/003/X6993E/], Market information services – Theory and Practice. FAO, Rome, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern communications technologies open up the possibility for market information services to improve information delivery through [[Short message service|SMS]] on cell phones and the rapid growth of [[FM broadcasting|FM]] radio stations in many developing countries offers the possibility of more localised information services. In the longer run, the internet may become an effective way of delivering information to farmers. However, problems associated with the cost and accuracy of data collection still remain to be addressed. Even when they have access to market information, farmers often require assistance in interpreting that information. For example, the market price quoted on the radio may refer to a wholesale selling price and farmers may have difficulty in translating this into a realistic price at their local assembly market.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd  [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/012/x8826e/x8826e00.pdf], Understanding and Using Market Information. FAO, Rome, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Various attempts have been made in developing countries to introduce commercial market information services but these have largely been targeted at traders, commercial farmers or exporters. It is not easy to see how small, poor farmers can generate sufficient income for a commercial service to be profitable although in India a new service introduced by [[Thomson Reuters]] was reportedly used by over 100,000 farmers in its first year of operation. [[Esoko]] in West Africa attempts to subsidize the cost of such services to farmers by charging access to a more advanced feature set of mobile-based tools to businesses.

===Marketing training===
Farmers frequently consider marketing as being their major problem. However, while they are able to identify such problems as poor prices, lack of transport and high post-harvest losses, they are often poorly equipped to identify potential solutions. Successful marketing requires learning new skills, new techniques and new ways of obtaining information. Extension officers working with ministries of agriculture or NGOs are often well-trained in agricultural production techniques but usually lack knowledge of marketing or post-harvest handling.&lt;ref&gt;Grahame Dixie [https://www.share4dev.info/ffsnet/documents/3628.pdf] Horticultural Marketing, Marketing Extension Guide 5, FAO, Rome, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enabling environments===
Agricultural marketing needs to be conducted within a supportive policy, legal, institutional, [[macroeconomics|macro-economic]], infrastructural and bureaucratic environment. Traders and others are generally reluctant to make investments in an uncertain policy climate, such as those that restrict imports and exports or internal produce movement. Businesses have difficulty functioning when their trading activities are hampered by excessive bureaucracy. Inappropriate law can distort and reduce the efficiency of the market, increase the costs of doing business and retard the development of a competitive private sector. Poor support institutions, such as [[agricultural extension]] services, [[municipality|municipalities]] that operate markets inefficiently and inadequate export promotion bodies, can be particularly damaging. Poor roads increase the cost of doing business, reduce payments to farmers and increase prices to consumers. Finally, [[Political corruption|corruption]] can increase the transaction costs faced by those in the marketing chain.

===Agricultural marketing support===
Most governments have at some stage made efforts to promote agricultural marketing improvements. In the United States the [[Agricultural Marketing Service]] (AMS) is a division of [[USDA]] and has programs that provide testing, support standardization and grading and offer market news services. AMS oversees marketing agreements and orders research and promotion programs. It also purchases commodities for federal food programs. USDA also provides support to agricultural marketing work at various universities. In the United Kingdom, support for marketing of some commodities was provided before and after the Second World War by boards such as the [[Milk Marketing Board]] and the [[Egg Marketing Board]]. These boards were closed down in the 1970s. As a colonial power, Britain established [[marketing board]]s in many countries, particularly in Africa. Some continue to exist although many were closed at the time of the introduction of [[structural adjustment]] measures in the 1990s.

Several developing countries have established government-sponsored marketing or agribusiness units. South Africa, for example, started the [http://www.namc.co.za/ National Agricultural Marketing Council (NAMC)] as a response to the deregulation of the agriculture industry and closure of marketing boards in the country. India has the long-established [[National Institute of Agricultural Marketing]]. These are primarily research and policy organizations, but other agencies provide facilitating services for marketing channels, such as the provision of infrastructure, market information and documentation support. Examples from the Caribbean include the [http://www.namdevco.com/ National Agricultural Marketing Development Corporation (NAMDEVCO)] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and the [http://www.newgmc.com/ New Guyana Marketing Corporation] in [[Guyana]].

===Recent developments===
New marketing linkages between [[agribusiness]], large retailers and farmers are gradually being developed, e.g. through [[contract farming]], group marketing and other forms of [[collective action]].&lt;ref&gt;Helen Markelova and Ruth Meinzen-Dick {{cite web|url=http://www.capri.cgiar.org/pdf/CA-Market_WksReport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716224158/http://www.capri.cgiar.org/pdf/CA-Market_WksReport.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-16 |df= }} Collective action and market access for smallholders: A summary of findings. CAPRi/IFPRI 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Donors and NGOs are paying increasing attention to ways of promoting direct linkages between farmers and buyers&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/a1123e/a1123e00.pdf] Approaches to linking producers to markets. FAO, Rome, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; within a value chain context. More attention is now being paid to the development of regional markets (e.g. East Africa) and to structured trading systems that should facilitate such developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=CTA and EAGC|title=Structured grain trading systems in Africa|url=http://publications.cta.int/media/publications/downloads/1749_PDF.pdf|publisher=CTA|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth of [[supermarkets]], particularly in Latin America and East and South East Asia, is having a significant impact on marketing channels for horticultural, dairy and livestock products.&lt;ref&gt;Reardon, T., C.P. Timmer, C.B. Barrett, J. Berdegue. “The Rise of Supermarkets in Africa, Asia, and Latin America,” American Journal of Agricultural Economics, 85 (5), December 2003: 1140-1146.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, “spot” markets will continue to be important for many years, necessitating attention to infrastructure improvement such as for retail and [[wholesale marketing|wholesale markets]].

In 2011, President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf conferred on Mr. Cummings the distinction of Knight Great Band – Humane Order of African Redemption; the medal is one of the highest honours in Liberia and is awarded for humanitarian work in Liberia, for acts supporting and assisting the Liberian nation.

During Cummings' time at Coca-Cola Africa, he oversaw the creation of The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation in response to the growth and impact of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.  In 2001, the Foundation established an extensive healthcare program for Coca-Cola workers affected by HIV/AIDS and related conditions across Africa in addition to supporting HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness throughout local communities.  Today, The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation is the largest regional foundation within Coca-Cola's global network with a focus on clean water, health education and entrepreneurship. Since 2001, it has granted more than $100&amp;nbsp;million to support sustainable communities in Africa.

He launched the Cummings Africa Foundation in 2015 with his wife Teresa Cummings, and their two kids Boakai and Ayo Cummings, the Cummings Foundation focuses on empowering and uplifting Africans in health, education, agriculture, and arts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5702">'''Belinda Mulrooney''' (1872&amp;ndash;1967) was an entrepreneur and purportedly the "richest woman in the Klondike".&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/gold/belinda.html |title=Belinda Mulrooney: The Richest Woman in the Klondike |publisher=[[National Postal Museum]] |accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made one fortune in the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], lost it, and amassed a second, which lasted most of her life.

Mulrooney was born in Ireland. When she was young, her family either emigrated to Pennsylvania, where her father worked as a miner&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania|Scranton]],&lt;ref name=ExploreNorth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://explorenorth.com/library/yafeatures/klondike_women.html |title=Women of the Klondike |author=Ken Spotswood |publisher=explorenorth.com |accessdate=July 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sent her to live with relatives there.&lt;ref name=Review&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rmmla.wsu.edu/ereview/55.1/reviews/parker.asp |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121215062148/http://rmmla.wsu.edu/ereview/55.1/reviews/parker.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 15, 2012 |title=Review of ''Staking Her Claim: The Life of Belinda Mulrooney, Klondike and Alaska Entrepreneur'', Melanie J. Mayer and Robert N. DeArmand |author=Allene M.

Instead of seeking her fortune as a prospector, Mulrooney bought supplies of "silk underwear, bolts of cotton cloth and hot water bottles"&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; with her savings of $5000&lt;ref name=ExploreNorth/&gt; and transported them over the [[Chilkoot Pass]] to [[Dawson City]], where she sold them for six times that amount in June 1897.&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; She built a restaurant in Dawson, then a roadhouse, the [[Grand Forks Hotel]] and restaurant, near the gold fields. Prospering, she started buying mining claims as well; by the end of the year, she either owned or was a partner in five.&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; She sold the hotel for $24,000 and set about building the finest hotel in Dawson. The [[Fairview Hotel]] opened its doors on July 27, 1898, with a restaurant and rooms for thirty guests.&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt;

Mulrooney once partnered with fellow Klondike legend [[Alex McDonald (prospector)|Alex McDonald]] to salvage the cargo from a small ship wrecked on a sand bar. McDonald got there first and took all of the food, leaving only [[Wellington boot|gum boots]] and whiskey for her. She got her revenge, however. The next spring, when McDonald needed boots for his workers, he had to pay her $100 a pair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Klondike: The Last Gold Rush 1896-1899 |last=Berton |first=Pierre |authorlink=Pierre Berton |year=2001 |publisher=Anchor Canada |isbn=0-385-65844-3 |pages=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 1900, Mulrooney married self-styled "Count" Charles Eugene Carbonneau, who claimed to be a French aristocrat, but was actually a champagne salesman and former barber from [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; By 1903&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; or 1904,&lt;ref name=Review/&gt; the couple separated, and she lost her fortune. She obtained a divorce in December 1906.&lt;ref name=Review/&gt;

Starting over, she moved to [[Fairbanks, Alaska]] in 1904&lt;ref name=PostalMuseum/&gt; or 1905&lt;ref name=Review/&gt; and prospered once again. She established the [[Dome City Bank]] in Fairbanks&lt;ref name=TimesLeader/&gt; with her younger sister Margaret.&lt;ref name=Review/&gt;

Mulrooney eventually retired to [[Yakima, Washington]], where she had a large mansion built. She supported her family until her money ran out. She then moved to [[Seattle]], where she died in 1967.

'''BlueSpice MediaWiki''' (BlueSpice for short) is [[Free software|free]] [[wiki]] software based on [[MediaWiki]] and licensed by [[GNU General Public License]]. It is especially developed for businesses as an [[Enterprise wiki#Enterprise wikis|enterprise wiki]] distribution for MediaWiki and used in over 150 countries.

==Editions==
BlueSpice is published in two editions:

* '''BlueSpice free''' is a gratis version for an entry level solution for businesses. It provides functional added value for wiki admins and users.
* '''BlueSpice pro''' is a business-critical solution with comprehensive functionalities, a growing number of available extensions and long-term support – updates and patches are also included.

Both editions are software collections, which are based on MediaWiki. The extensions are developed by Hallo Welt! GmbH, its technology partners or independent MediaWiki developers.

==Usage scenarios for BlueSpice==

[[File:Bluespice Icon.svg|150px|thumb|right|The icon of BlueSpice.]]

BlueSpice is mostly used as

* a central company wiki,
* a technical documentation platform (e.g. IT help desk or for product specifications)
* a quality handbook (descriptions of processes and procedures)
* knowledge management platform (lessons learned, expert debriefing)
* documentation tool for research and development

{{Clear}}

==Functionality==
[[File:BlueSpice_Search_Center_3-0.jpg|thumb|right|Search engine (Elasticsearch)]]
[[File:BlueSpice_Timeline_3-0.png|thumb|right|Timeline functionality for tracking discussions and contributions]]
[[File:BlueSpice_Permission_Manager_3-0.jpg|thumb|right|Graphical user interface for rights management]]
Some central features of BlueSpice are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/BlueSpice#Featurelist |title = BlueSpice features|publisher=mediawiki.org |accessdate = 2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Visual editing''': allowing editing without any knowledge of wiki code (WYSIWYG). This makes creating tables, and uploading and inserting pictures easier than with MediaWiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Bailey | first = Matt | title = BlueSpice (fixing MediaWiki) | publisher = Nerdnuts.com | date = 12 September 2013 | url = http://www.nerdnuts.com/2013/09/bluespice-fixing-mediawiki/ | accessdate = 18 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Search and navigation''': An extended search ([[Elasticsearch]]) offers improved search functionalities, like [[faceted search]]. The search results can further be sorted or filtered by category, namespace, author, semantic data, data type etc. Any files attached are also searched. It also provides common features like [[autocomplete]] and [[Incremental search|search as you type]]. The navigation in the wiki is individually customizable via the Dashboard or a UserSidebar.
*'''Quality assurance and review tools''' (workflow tool, reminder e.a.): Pages for instance can be assigned to a reviewer. This allows articles to be reviewed and approved.
*'''Book function''': Individual articles can be grouped into article collections to create manuals, documentations or instructions with chapter navigation. The books can be exported with it in different formats (PDF, DOCX) together with the respective file attachments.
*'''Meta data and semanti'''c: analyze and work with meta data.
*'''Communication''': Additional discussion and blog functionalities, a timeline and notification system support editorial processes.
*'''Administration''': Convenient management of users, [[namespaces]], groups, rights and settings.

==Technology==
BlueSpice is written in the [[PHP]] programming language and uses [[MySQL]], [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]]/IIS, [[Apache Tomcat|Tomcat]] (optional). The editions can be installed on top of an existing MediaWiki installation or as a standalone installation that includes MediaWiki.

The distribution is a collection of extensions, which can be extended with user-specific features or skins. While every single extension can be deactivated, BlueSpice editions integrate and standardize extensions to improve the user experience and maintenance.

==Licensing==
According to the MediaWiki standard all extensions are published under the GPLv3 license.

==History==
The German company Hallo Welt! has been working on developing the open source wiki software BlueSpice since 2007. The project was originally initiated by IBM ("bluepedia"), who wanted to deploy MediaWiki but was unable to live with its downsides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Eckenfels  | first = Mela | title = Spicy: BlueSpice for MediaWiki | journal = Linux Magazine | issue = 132 | pages = 28–31 | publisher = Linux New Media | location = Munich | date = November 2011 | url = http://www.medialinx-shop.com/magazines/linux-magazine-linux-pro-magazine/back-issues/eh30132.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Hallo Welt! decided to publish their wiki as free [[Open-source software|Open source]] software. The stable version of BlueSpice for MediaWiki was released July 4, 2011.&lt;ref name="Eckenfels"&gt;Eckenfels, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; From this point on, a free download has been available at [[SourceForge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/bluespice/files |title = Download BlueSpice|publisher=Soureceforge.net |accessdate = 2013-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first release of BlueSpice was a couple of extensions and is today a complete stand-alone distribution, which has the latest MediaWiki as a core system but offers in the free version more than 50 distinct extensions and a completely different user interface. Following independent sources the BlueSpice free distribution is one of the most popular wiki software for knowledge management in organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Figura | first = Maria |author2=Gross, Daphne | title = Die Qual der Wiki-Wahl.

In autumn 2013, Hallo Welt! released the completely reworked version BlueSpice 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Huber | first = Mathias  | title = Blue Spice 2: Enterprise-Wiki generalüberholt | publisher = Linux Magazin | date = 27 November 2013 | url = http://www.linux-magazin.de/NEWS/Blue-Spice-2-Enterprise-Wiki-generalueberholt | accessdate = 18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the BlueSpice developers this release aims for opening up BlueSpice for freelance developers in the global MediaWiki community, and lays the foundation for many new language versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Heigl | first = Richard  |  title = BlueSpice 2: The new version coming up later this year! | publisher = BlueSpice News | date = 4 September 2013 | url = http://blog.bluespice.com/2013/09/04/bluespice-2-the-new-version-coming-up-later-this-year/ | accessdate = 18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==

Boon Pong, using as cover his contract with the Imperial Japanese Army to supply the canteens of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[prisoners of war|POWs]] working along the [[Kwai Lo River]], smuggled medicine, money and contraband food to the POWs and is credited by many with saving thousands of lives during the building of the [[Burma Railway]].

Although Thailand made peace with the Japanese after being invaded, there was an active underground movement. One prisoner recalls Boonpong was the merchant with the lowest prices and the smallest mark up. However he performed other services risking his life and those of his family. He lent money, provided extra medicines and ran messages. With access to medicines, the death rate of the prisoners was reduced from five a day in May 1943 to one a week by the following November.

==Post-war==

After the war, Boonpong was attacked by Thai police in some mistaken retribution. Sir [[Edward Dunlop|Edward 'Weary' Dunlop]], another hero of the POW camps, ordered a report on 'the condition of Mr. Boonpong, injured Thai civilian, who had done so much for prisoners of war.’  In 1947 he was in financial difficulties and so a [[prisoner of war|POW]] association on hearing of it organised a collection for him. Shortly thereafter, Boonpong started the Boonpong Bus Company. In 1948 he was awarded the [[Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|MBE]] by the British Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-spiceislands.com/Thailand/boonpong.htm Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211143158/http://www.the-spiceislands.com/Thailand/boonpong.htm |date=February 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later an Australian medical scholarship was named in honor of him and Sir Edward Dunlop. The documentary film “The Quiet Lions” is about both of them. Boonpong also figures prominently in ''Beyond the Bamboo Screen'', a collection of anecdotes by Scottish PoWs.

==In popular culture==

[[Rungsak Loychusak]] portrayed Boonpong Sirivejjabhandu in ''[[Boonpong]]'' a [[thai television soap opera]] based on the true story him. ''Boonpong'' was broadcast on [[Thai Public Broadcasting Service|Thai PBS]] during 8 May 2013 - 20 June 2013.

'''Chief analytics officer''' ('''CAO''') is a job title for the senior manager responsible for the analysis of data within an organization, such as a listed company or an educational institution. The CAO often reports to the [[chief executive officer]].

Not many companies currently have the role of Chief Analytics Officer (CAO) defined within their existing c-suite. However this is a fast emerging position that would be pivotal in massive transformation - in the way companies take their business decisions. CAOs not only bring strong data science backed actionable insights to the table, but also own the resulting 'ROI'/'Impact' on both top line and bottom line numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-a-o.net/about.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109234330/http://www.c-a-o.net/about.html |archivedate=2015-01-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This position, along with that of [[chief information officer]] has risen to prominence due to the rise in [[information technology]] and [[data acquisition]]. The two positions are similar in that both deal with information, but the CIO focuses on the infrastructure required for maintaining and communicating information while the CAO focuses on the infrastructure required for generating and analyzing information. A similar position is that of the [[chief data officer]] (CDO); while the CDO focuses on data processing and maintenance, the CAO focuses on providing input into operational decisions on the basis of the analysis. As such, the CAO requires experience in [[statistical analysis]] and [[marketing]], [[finance]], or [[Business operations|operations]]. The CAO may be a member of the [[board of directors]] of the organization, but this is dependent on the type of organization.

No specific qualification is typical of CAOs in general. Many have advanced degrees in [[mathematics]], [[statistics]], [[economics]], or [[econometrics]] but this is by no means universal. Many were analysts in the past.

'''Changing role of the Chief Data Officer and growth in the Chief Analytics Office'''

Research* indicates that First Generation CDOs are typically responsible for the following:

* Assessing the state of the company's data which, more often than not, is in some state of disrepair
* Developing a data warehouse that acts as a central repository for all of the company's data
* Defining the data governance, management and ownership frameworks that will ensure data quality is created and maintained
* Working with business to understand data requirements and then how to provide them with this data - whilst maintaining control (see point above)
* Assisting in developing reporting tools through BI, visualisation tools, etc.
* Ensuring compliance to data or sector-specific regulations - this is mostly true in the financial services sector where most companies employ a CDO to make sure that they're compliant to regulations

In addition to these key responsibilities, the First Generation CDO is concerned with communicating his/her value to the organisation, evangelising the importance of data and building business processes to ensure efficient workflows.

These are all the critical, foundation-building baby steps that need to be taken before moving into the next phase or generation of CDO-ship. The CDO is producing step-changes within the organisation's data architecture and usage. Change is big but perhaps does not deliver significant business value.

'''Second Generation CDOs and the shift into a CAO'''

Our research has uncovered that, in the second phase, there is almost a shift away from being a CDO toward being a Chief Analytics Officer. The ultimate end goal for data in an organisation is to have the ability to use it to make good decisions in real time.

It's based on this that I assess the Second Generation CDO as being increasingly responsible for, and involved with, advanced business analytics. The first phase was all about getting data in shape for it to be utilised accurately across the business.

It's at this point where the CDO is involved in the optimisation and transformation of the business. 
 Our research has uncovered that, in the second phase, there is almost a shift away from being a CDO toward being a Chief Analytics Officer. The ultimate end goal for data in an organisation is to have the ability to use it to make good decisions in real time.
Innovation through data!

The Second Generation CDO becomes an integral part of eking out the hard-fought percentages of business improvement and profitability. Innovation across the organisation has come to rely on data. Product innovation takes a look at how the product is performing, who buys it, how it is manufactured etc. to evolve it and keep its competitive edge. None of this could be done without access to good quality data in real time - or at least in a short space of time.

A recent study shows an increasing number of CDO's at the forefront of their company's digital transformation, most likely because data and analytics play such a critical role in digitising a business, and so as a result many Chief Data Officers have moved in Chief Digital Officer roles.

'''What does the Future Look Like?'''

It's not easy to predict what the next generation will look like and how they'll act. I don't think Facebook anticipated that the current youngest generation would not be big users of the service.

Data Digest points that out by the development of the CDO - and for that matter the CAO and the Chief Digital Officer. Could they all blend into one? Or will they be obsolete in a few years and replaced with a new emerging C-suite?

For now, we'll keep focused on understanding the different needs of the First Generation and Second Generation of CDOs to ensure we can provide relevant information and networks. It is likely that the next generation will only emerge in 4–5 years time.

He is the founder and owner of Gold Star group, which includes Gold Star Financial Group and Gold Star Sports. Clients include [[Pavel Datsyuk]] and Artemi Panarin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theathletic.com/141648/2017/10/30/custance-hockey-world-unsure-how-to-handle-agent-dan-milstein-as-he-takes-over/|title=Custance: Hockey world unsure how to handle agent Dan...|work=The Athletic|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Daniel Milstein was born in Kiev, Ukraine, which was then known as the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.&lt;ref name="BookAward"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.annarbor.com/entertainment/ann-arbor-authors-book-17-cents-and-a-dream-wins-an-award/|title=Ann Arbor author's book, '17 Cents and a Dream,' wins an award|last1=McKee|first1=Jenn|date=May 16, 2013|work=Ann Arbor News|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milstein wrote ''17 Cents and a Dream,'' about his family’s emigration to the United States. He wrote about his family’s arrival and starting from nothing to building Gold Star Companies. Milstein has written three other books including&lt;ref name="Crains" /&gt; ''Rule #1 Don’t Be #2'', released in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwbooks/article/Rule-1-Dont-Be-2-Wins-Beach-Book-Festival-Named-Runner-Up-in-New-York-Book-Festival-20170724|title=Rule #1 Don't Be #2 Wins Beach Book Festival, Named Runner Up in New York Book Festival|last=Desk|first=BWW News|access-date=2017-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Milstein graduated from [[Cleary University]] before founding Gold Star Financial Group in 2000. The company began as a mortgage provider based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Milstein didn’t engage in the subprime bubble and had significant growth during the 2008 mortgage crisis. They were on ''Inc''.’s 2009 list of 500 Fastest-Growing privately-held companies and ''Crain's'' named Milstein on their list of "40 Under 40”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/797334609|title=Nice companies finish first : why cutthroat management is over--and collaboration is in|last=Peter.|first=Shankman,|date=2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0230341896|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=797334609}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Daniel Milstein#cite note-Crains-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

Milstein was a friend and interpreter of [[Pavel Datsyuk]] before becoming his agent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2011/05/02/106063232/disgusting-but-in-a-good-way|title=Disgusting But In a Good Way|last=Cazeneuve|first=Brian|date=May 2, 2011|website=Sports Illustrated|archive-url=https://www.si.com/vault/2011/05/02/106063232/disgusting-but-in-a-good-way|archive-date=November 21, 2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and managed negotiations for Datsyuk’s retirement from the NHL. After that, Milstein became the agent for several other Russian [[National Hockey League|NHL]] players. In December 2016, Milstein (as Gold Star Sports Management) stepped in during [[Artemi Panarin]]’s contract negotiation with the [[Chicago Blackhawks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/hockey/blackhawks/ct-artemi-panarin-contract-blackhawks-spt-0108-20170107-story.html|title=Late agent switch doesn't derail Artemi Panarin's deal with Blackhawks|last=Hine|first=Chris Kuc, Chris|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2017-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blackhawks and Panarin agreed to a two-year extension worth $12 million; Panarin was later traded to the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]]. [[Danis Zaripov]] was represented by Milstein in negotiations with the NHL after being banned by the IIHF. Zaripov was declared eligible to play in September 2017.

Milstein represents several other Russian players including [[Nikita Zaitsev]], [[Alexey Marchenko]], [[Andrei Mironov (ice hockey)|Andrei Mironov]], [[Vladislav Namestnikov]], [[Nikita Soshnikov]], [[Klim Kostin]] and, [[Nikita Nesterov]] and [[Nikita Kucherov]].

'''Downtown Saint Paul''' is an official neighborhood in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]], [[Minnesota]], United States. Its boundaries are the [[Mississippi River]] to the south, [[University Avenue (Minneapolis–Saint Paul)|University Avenue]] to the north, [[U.S. Route 52 in Minnesota|US 52]] to the east, and [[Kellogg Avenue]] to the west. It is bounded by the [[Dayton's Bluff, Saint Paul|Dayton's Bluff]], [[Summit-University]], [[West Seventh, Saint Paul|West Seventh]], [[Frogtown]], West Side, and Payne-Phalen neighborhoods. The West Side neighborhood is on the other side of the river, and can be accessed via the [[Robert Street Bridge]] or the [[Wabasha Street Bridge]]. [[Interstate 35E (Minnesota)|Interstate 35E]] and [[Interstate 94 (Minnesota)|Interstate 94]] run through the north side of the neighborhood, providing a separation between the [[Minnesota State Capitol]] and other state government buildings with the rest of downtown.

==Government==
The [[Minnesota State Capitol]] is located on the northern fringe of the downtown neighborhood. Work began on the current capitol in 1896, and construction was completed in 1905. The early 1950s saw the development of the expansive mall that currently surrounds the capitol. This development required the demolition of many homes, apartments, churches, and businesses, and paved the way for the construction of four government agency buildings surrounding the mall: Veteran Services Building, the Transportation Building, the Centennial Office Building, and the National Guard Armory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Millett |first=Larry |date=2010 |title=AIA Guide to Downtown St. Paul |url= |location=St. Paul |publisher=Minnesota Historical Society |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Paul City Hall and Ramsey County Courthouse]] is also located downtown.

==Economy==
A number of corporations and institutions are located in downtown Saint Paul. Since 1933, [[Ecolab]] has maintained its headquarters in downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.twincities.com/2015/04/15/ecolab-to-acquire-downtown-travelers-building-move-operations/ | title=Ecolab to acquire downtown Travelers building, move operations | publisher=Pioneer Press | author=Woltman, Nick | date=April 15, 2015 | accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 [[Twin Cities PBS]] relocated to its current location in downtown&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tpt.org/about/who-we-are/ | title=Who We Are | publisher=Twin Cities PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 the [[Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System]] moved its headquartered in the [[Wells Fargo Place]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mnscu.edu/board/summary/1997/april.html | title=April 1997 Board Meeting Summary | publisher=Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minnesota Public Radio]] purchased its current downtown headquarters in 2001 from the Public Housing Agency of St. Paul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/minnesota-public-radio-will-expand-in-st-paul-through-purchases-adjacent-to-current-headquarters-mpr-renews-its-commitment-to-the-capital-city-73719487.html | title=Minnesota Public Radio Will Expand in St. Paul Through Purchases Adjacent To Current Headquarters; MPR Renews Its Commitment to the Capital City | publisher=PRNewsWire | date=October 18, 2001 | accessdate=April 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 [[Gander Mountain]] relocated to downtown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ranieng.com/pdf/Deubener%20Award.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Securian Financial Group]] is located in the Securian Center and is the largest private employer in downtown with 2,600 employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twincities.com/2016/04/04/downtown-st-pauls-oldest-tallest-and-most-expensive/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Travelers Insurance]] maintains a large presence downtown, employing 2,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twincities.com/2016/04/04/downtown-st-pauls-oldest-tallest-and-most-expensive/]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 supercomputer manufacturer [[Cray Inc.]] relocated to become the anchor tenant of the [[Cray Plaza]] in downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mprnews.org/story/2009/07/21/cray_stpaul | publisher=Minnesota Public Radio | date=July 21, 2009 | accessdate=March 10, 2017 | title=Cray, Inc. signs lease to move to downtown St. Paul | author=Baier, Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Lowertown Historic District (Saint Paul, Minnesota)}}
The Lowertown Historic District is a [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]] on the east-side of Downtown Saint Paul. This 16-block warehouse and wholesaling district comprises 37 [[contributing properties]] built 1870s–1920. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983 for the significance of its river and rail connections, economic impact, architecture, and urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Murphy |first=Patricia |author2=Susan Granger |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Lowertown Historic District |url=http://nrhp.mnhs.org/nomination/83000935.pdf |publisher=National Park Service |date=1981-11-30 |accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years Lowertown has been undergoing changes from a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]], artist-community into a [[gentrification|gentrified]] neighborhood filled with coffee shops, restaurants, bars, breweries, and market-rate apartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.citypages.com/restaurants/reviews/st-pauls-lowertown-is-one-of-the-hottest-hoods-in-the-twin-cities-7645437 | title=St. Paul's Lowertown is one of the hottest hoods in the Twin Cities | publisher=City Pages | date=September 9, 2015 | accessdate=April 21, 2017 | author=Bos, Mecca}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.twincities.com/2016/11/25/in-st-pauls-lowertown-artists-react-to-changes-with-unease/ | title=In St. Paul’s Lowertown, artists react to changes with unease | publisher=Pioneer Press | author=Melo, Fredrick | date=November 25, 2016 | accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parks==
Downtown has three city parks, two of which predate [[Minnesota Territory|Minnesota statehood]]. The land for both [[Lowertown Historic District (Saint Paul, Minnesota)#Mears Park|Mears Park]] and [[Rice Park]] was donated to the city of Saint Paul in 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.historicsaintpaul.org/files/lower_phalen_creek.pdf | title=Tour of St. Paul - East Side to Lowertown | publisher=Historic Saint Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.planning.org/greatplaces/spaces/2011/ricepark.htm | title=Rice Park: St. Paul, Minnesota | publisher=American Planning Association | date=2017 | accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parks have gone through numerous renovations and host several festivals throughout the year. Rice Park most notably hosts the [[Saint Paul Winter Carnival]] which is the oldest winter carnival in the country, having operated since 1886.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.wintercarnival.com/about/history-of-the-saint-paul-winter-carnival/ | title=History of the Saint Paul Winter Carnival | publisher=Saint Paul Winter Carnival | date=2017 | accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999, Mears Park has hosted the [[Twin Cities Jazz Festival]].

'''Drug Master File''' or '''DMF''' is a document prepared by a [[pharmaceutical]] manufacturer and submitted solely at its discretion to the appropriate regulatory authority in the intended drug market. There is no regulatory requirement to file a DMF. However, the document provides the regulatory authority with confidential, detailed information about facilities, processes, or articles used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storing of one or more human drugs. Typically, a drug master file is filed when two or more firms work in partnership on developing or manufacturing a drug product. The DMF filing allows a firm to protect its [[intellectual property]] from its partner while complying with regulatory requirements for disclosure of processing details.

== Description ==
Drug Master File (DMF) is a document containing complete information on an [[Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient]] (API) or finished drug [[dosage form]]. An Active Substance Master File (ASMF) is the currently recognised term in Europe, formerly known as European Drug Master File (EDMF) or a US-Drug Master file (US-DMF) in the United States.

The DMF contains factual and complete information on a drug product's chemistry, manufacture, stability, purity, impurity profile, packaging,
and the [[Good manufacturing practice|cGMP]] status of any human drug product.

A drug master file comprises two parts: the Applicant’s Part (USA: Open Part), which contains all the information that the licence-holder needs to assess the quality and submit a licence or amendment application; and the Restricted Part (USA: Closed Part), which contains confidential information about the manufacturing procedure only disclosed to the authorities.

== DMFs in the United States ==
In the United States, DMFs are submitted to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). The Main Objective of the DMF is to support regulatory requirements and to prove the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product for obtaining an [[Investigational New Drug]] Application (IND), a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA),As an [[Abbreviated New Drug Application]] (ANDA), another DMF, or an Export Application.

In United States there are 5 types of Drug Master file:&lt;ref name="FDAguideDMF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122886.htm|title=Guideline for Drug Master Files|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Type I Manufacturing Site, Facilities, Operating Procedures and Personnel

:* Type II Drug Substance, Drug Substance Intermediate, and Material Used in Their Preparation, or Drug Product

:* Type III Packaging Material

:* Type IV Excipient, Colorant, Flavor, Essence, or Material Used in Their Preparation

:* Type V FDA Accepted Reference Information

== DMFs in Europe ==
The content and the format for drug master file used in United States differs from that used in [[List of European countries|European Countries]] to obtain market authorization (MA). The Main Objective of the EDMF is to support regulatory requirements of a medicinal product to prove its quality, safety and efficacy. This helps to obtain a Marketing Authorisation grant.

'''DMF LISTS'''

IMPORTANT NOTE

The current list contains DMFs RECEIVED by March 31, 2012. However the submitted date is listed for each DMF.

The list of DMFs is current as of March 31, 2012, through DMF 25923. Changes to the DMF activity status, DMF type, holder name, and subject made since the last update of January 11, 2012 are included.

The list is available in Microsoft Excel and in ASCII (tab-delimited).

The current lists are posted (1Q2012) as well as the lists from the last quarter (4Q2011) to permit users to compare lists for updates and changes.
'''
TYPES OF DMFs'''

The types of DMFs are:

Type I Manufacturing Site, Facilities, Operating Procedures, and Personnel (no longer applicable)
Type II Drug Substance, Drug Substance Intermediate, and Material Used in Their Preparation, or Drug Product
Type III Packaging Material
Type IV Excipient, Colorant, Flavor, Essence, or Material Used in Their Preparation
Type V FDA Accepted Reference Information
STATUS OF DMFS

“A” = Active. This means that the DMF was found acceptable for filing, administratively, and is up-to-date.
“I” = Inactive
“N” = Not an assigned number
“P” = DMF Pending Filing Review
The status conveys no information about whether DMF has been reviewed for technical content.

'''INACTIVE STATUS OF DMFs'''

There are three reasons to list a DMF as inactive:
* The holder requested that the DMF be closed (or retired, closed, inactivated, or withdrawn) by submitting a closure request.
* The FDA closed the DMF because the holder did not respond to an overdue notification letter within 90 days by updating the DMF.
* The DMF was overdue for update. The FDA considers DMFs submitted before March 31 overdue for update when the company has submitted no annual reports since that date. The FDA considers only an annual report sufficient to prevent them sending an overdue notice letter (ONL).

The status ''Inactive'' in the list does not distinguish among the reasons listed above.

DMFs must be current at the time of review. According to FDA regulations regarding DMFs (21 CFR 314.420(c)):
:''“Any addition, change, or deletion of information in a drug master file (except the list required under paragraph (d) of this section) is required to be submitted in two copies and to describe by name, reference number, volume, and page number the information affected in the drug master file.”''
The Guideline for Drug Master Files (September 1989), recommends that DMF holders update their DMFs annually (see below under Annual reports).

To ensure DMFs are current, the FDA sends ''overdue notification letters'' (ONLs) to DMF holders for DMFs that are overdue for update (see above). If a DMF holder does not respond to this letter within 90 days by submitting an annual report, the FDA considers the DMF ''closed by the FDA,'' and ''retired''.

Note that the FDA has a backlog sending out ONLs. DMF holders can forestall the sending of an ONL by updating their DMFs, following the procedure below under ''Retaining the activity of a DMF.''

===Retiring DMFs===
A DMF can be retired only if it is closed. A retired DMF is unavailable for review.

===Retaining DMF activity===
A DMF holder that wants to retain the activity of a DMF listed as Inactive and not closed must submit an annual report (two copies). This is also the process used to respond to an ONL. The cover letter must specify that it is an ''annual report.''

===Reactivating a closed DMF===
A company can return a closed DMF to active status only by submitting a ''reactivation.'' The reactivation must contain a complete re-submission of the DMF, updated to meet current guidance.

===Guidance===
For drug master files, the version posted on the web is the current version. The address for submitting DMF documentation to the FDA in the Guidance is dmfquestion@cder.fda.gov.

FDA regulations require that all foreign language submissions to INDs and NDAs have complete, accurate translations. The same is true for DMFs. The FDA does not require a [[certified translation]].

===More information about DMFs===
DMF guidance recommendations, in general, still apply. However, the information below provides additional information or clarification in three categories:
* Category 1: Recommendations no longer applicable due to changes in regulations or guidances
* Category 2: Additional clarification of recommendations in the Guidance
* Category 3: New information for DMF filing aspects not in effect when the company wrote the Guidance

Mailing address for filing original DMFs and all subsequent DMF documents (Category 3):
:Food and Drug Administration
:Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
:Central Document Room
:5901-B Amendale Road
:Beltsville MD 20705-1266

Companies send two paper copies of all submissions to an existing paper DMF to the address above. The FDA does not accept submissions via e-mail or CDs. Companies may submitted two-sided copies of DMFs.

===DMF reviews (Category 3)===
When the FDA receives a DMF, they review it for administrative content. This may take 2–3 weeks. If the DMF is acceptable from an administrative point of view, the FDA issues an acknowledgement letter, which notifies the holder of the DMF number. If the FDA finds the DMF not acceptable from an administrative view, they notify the holder of the deficiencies they must correct.

The FDA reviews the DMF for technical information only after the following events occur:

# The DMF holder submits a Letter of Authorization (LOA) in two copies to the FDA. This LOA must contain the DMF number.
# The holder sends a copy of the LOA to the authorized party (customer).
# The customer submits an application to the FDA that contains a copy of the LOA.

===Pre-assignment of DMF Numbers (Category 3)===
The FDA grants requests for preassigned DMF numbers for electronic or paper DMFs. (See ''Requesting a Pre-Assigned Application number.'')

===Format and content of the application's ''Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls'' section (Category 1)===
Companies submit DMFs following the format recommended in the ''Guidance for Industry M4Q: The CTD - Quality.''

===Conversion to Common Technical Document===
Companies may convert an existing DMF in non-CTD format to CTD format. In such cases, the FDA advises DMF holders to submit an amendment that contains all applicable CTD-specified sections to the material in the DMF. Each section must be complete and current. For drug substances and excipients, companies must submit all sections of 3.2.S in Module 3. For drug products, companies must submit all sections of 3.2.P in Module 3. If the reformatting causes changes in the DMFs technical content—e.g., adds new information—the cover letter for the new submission must describe these changes. DMFs in CTD format must follow CTD Guidance, e.g., be paginated within each section. This supersedes DMF guidance.

For conversion of a paper DMF to electronic CTD format, see Electronic DMF.

DMFs that cover multiple items, e.g., Type III DMFs for components of container-closure systems or Type IV DMFs for flavors, can be submitted in CTD format. Technical information can be in Module 3, following the outline in the Drug Substance Section. Sections within 3.2.S. can be populated as appropriate. Each product, such as different flavors, must have a different name—e.g. ''3.2.S.[Flavor 1], 3.2.S.[Flavor 2].'' Information common to different products—e.g., analytical procedures—can be accessed by reference (or links in the case of an Electronic DMF) from the relevant section for that product, e.g., ''3.2.4.2 [Flavor 1].''

DMF holders who submit DMFs for sterile manufacturing can consult the ''Manual of Policies and Procedures 5040.1: Product Quality Microbiology Information in the Common Technical Document - Quality (CTD-Q).'' Companies don't have to file separate sections for the same product manufactured at separate facilities unless the manufacturing processes are different.

Module 1 must contain the following information
Section 1.2: Cover Letter and Statement of Commitment
Section 1.3: Administrative Information

1.3.1 Contact/sponsor/Applicant information
1.3.1.1 Change of address or corporate name
Can be used to supply addresses of DMF holder and manufacturing and testing facilities

1.3.1.2 Change in contact/agent
Can be used to supply the name and address of contact persons and/or agents, including Agent Appointment Letter.
1.4.1 - Letter of Authorization (LOA)
Submission by the owner of information, giving authorization for the information to be used by another. An Agent Appointment Letter is NOT an LOA and should not be called “Letter of Authorization” and should not be submitted in Section 1.4.1
1.4.2 - Statement of Right of Reference
Submission by recipient of a Letter of Authorization with a copy of the LOA and statement of right of reference. Submitted in a DMF only when another DMF is referenced.
1.4.3 - List of authorized persons to incorporate by reference
This list should be submitted in DMF annual reports.
Section 1.12.14 Environmental Analysis: See Environmental Assessment

The language in the following sentence in the DMF Guidance, Section VII.B.1, has confused some DMF holders:

:''“A DMF is required to contain a complete list of persons authorized to incorporate information in the DMF by reference [21 CFR 314.420(d)].”''
It does not mean to say that a company must list all individuals in the DMF holder’s company who are authorized to submit information to the DMF.

The language in the CFR is clearer:

:''“The drug master file is required to contain a complete list of each person currently authorized to incorporate by reference any information in the file, identifying by name, reference number, volume, and page number the information that each person is authorized to incorporate.”''

==Types of DMFs==
'''&lt;u&gt;Type I DMFs (Category 1)&lt;/u&gt;'''

The FDA no longer accepts Type I DMFs, per a final rule published on January 12, 2000 (65 FR 1776). See Type V DMFs below.

Holders of Type II, III, and IV DMFs must not place information regarding facilities, personnel, or general operating procedures in these DMFs. They should only submit DMF holder addresses, manufacturing sites, and contact personnel. See ''Administrative Information in a DMF.''

'''&lt;u&gt;Type II DMFs (Category 1)&lt;/u&gt;'''

For Type II DMFs filed in CTD-Q format, the FDA expects Module 2.

Drug Substance
Type II DMFs for drug substances may be submitted in the format for "Drug substance" in the "Guidance for Industry M4Q: The CTD - Quality".(Category 3) Drug Substance:
See the current Guideline for Submitting Supporting Documentation in Drug Applications for the Manufacture of Drug Substances.
It is not necessary to include a Methods Validation Package (3.2.R.3). Methods Validation information should be submitted in Section 3.2.S.4.3.
See also the DRAFT ICH Guidance “Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances
Drug Product:
Type II DMFs for drug products may be submitted in the format for "Drug product" in the "Guidance for Industry M4Q: The CTD - Quality".(Category 3) Drug Product.
See the Guideline For Submitting Supporting Documentation In Drug Applications For The Manufacture Of Drug Products.
It is not necessary to include a Methods Validation Package (3.2.R.3). Methods Validation information should be submitted in Section 3.2.P.5.3.

Examples of drugs that would be classified as Type II DMFs include Amifostine, Caffeine, Desonide Micro, Ibuprofen Softgels, Viatmin E Oil, and Zinc Gluconate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.registrarcorp.com/fda-drugs/dmf-examples/type2|title=DMF Type II Examples {{!}} Registrar Corp|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate DMFs should be submitted for drug substances and drug products.

'''&lt;u&gt;Type III DMFs (Category 1)&lt;/u&gt;'''

The applicable Guidance for Type III DMFs is the “Guidance for Industry: Container Closure Systems for Packaging Human Drugs and Biologics: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Documentation” and Questions and Answers. (Category 3)

A Manual of Policies and Procedures covering reviewer responsibilities for review of Type III DMFs has been implemented. MAPP 5015.5 CMC Reviews of Type III DMFs for Packaging Materials This MAPP instructs reviewers to look for information regarding many packaging materials in the application (IND, NDA, ANDA) for the drug product that utilizes the packaging material before reviewing the DMF. Much of the information needed for review can be provided directly to the applicant for inclusion in the application, thereby avoiding the need to review the DMF.

Examples of products that would be classified as Type III DMFs include bottles, seals, dispensers, and vials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.registrarcorp.com/fda-drugs/dmf-examples/type3?lang=en|title=DMF Type III Examples {{!}} Registrar Corp|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Type IV DMFs (Category 3)&lt;/u&gt;'''

Type IV DMFs should be used for products such as excipients, colorants, flavors, essences, or other materials used in product preparation. Examples of materials that would use a Type IV DMF include bases, waxes, and edible inks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.registrarcorp.com/fda-drugs/dmf-examples/type4?lang=en|title=DMF Type IV Examples {{!}} Registrar Corp|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See relevant section in the Guideline for Drug Master Files. Toxicology studies may be submitted in the same DMF as the CMC information but they should be in a separate volume or volumes. It is preferable for holders to submit such information as a separate Type V DMF. See also the “Guidance for Industry: Nonclinical Studies for the Safety Evaluation of Pharmaceutical Excipients
Type V DMFs (Category 3)

The following types of DMFs may be filed as '''&lt;u&gt;Type V DMFs&lt;/u&gt;''' without requesting prior clearance from FDA.

Manufacturing Site, Facilities, Operating Procedures, and Personnel for sterile manufacturing plants. See Guidance for Industry for the Submission Documentation for Sterilization Process Validation in Applications for Human and Veterinary Drug Products.
Contract Facilities for the manufacture of biotech products. See Draft Guidance for Industry: Submitting Type V Drug Master Files to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
For other submissions as Type V DMFs the holder must request permission from FDA before filing a Type V DMF. (21 CFR 314.420(a)(5)). Prospective Type V DMF holders may send their request to dmfquestion@cder.fda.gov, explaining the necessity for filing the information in a Type V DMF.

Examples of sites and procedures that would require Type V DMFs include clinical studies, sterilization facilities, and toxicological information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.registrarcorp.com/fda-drugs/dmf-examples/type5?lang=en|title=DMF Type V Examples {{!}} Registrar Corp|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Administrative Information in a DMF''' (Category 3)

The only elements of the administrative information that should be in a DMF are:

The name and address of the holder
The name and address of manufacturing facility
For the contact person:
Name
Mailing Address
Telephone number
Fax number
E-mail address
Statement of Commitment
The name and address of the agent (if applicable)
For the contact person at the agent (if applicable):
Name
Mailing Address
Telephone number
Fax number
E-mail address
The appointment of an Agent is optional. See discussion below under “Agents”

Submission of Amendments, Annual Reports, and Letters of Authorization(Category 3)

To facilitate processing of documents that are submitted to an existing DMF, please list the Submission Type and the Category/Subcategory of the Amendment (Supporting Document) in bold type in the header on the transmittal letter. See list below. More than one Submission Type/Category/Subcategory can be used but all must be listed.

Example: If updated stability data is submitted at the same time as an Annual Report, the heading of the Cover Letter should state:

Annual Report
Original: Quality/Stability

FDA’s database is structured as follows:

Application:
Submission
Amendment (called "Supporting Document") in the database)
Amendments (Supporting Documents) are named by a Category and Subcategory

For the Application Type “Drug Master File” the Submission Types are

Original: Information containing changes to technical information are filed in the “Original” submission. For Categories and Subcategories, see list below. Note that a new DMF does not need a “Category” designation by the holder.
Annual Report: There are no Amendments (Supporting Documents) Categories and Subcategories
Letter of Authorization: There is only one Category with two Subcategories:
Letter of Authorization
Withdrawal of Authorization
Categories of Amendments (Supporting Documents) in General Information
Category: Closure Request
Category: Reactivation (Used only when a DMF has been Closed.)
Category: Administrative

Subcategories under Administrative Category
change in the holder name
change in holder address
change in ownership of the DMF (either internal name change, or change in ownership)
change in the agent name or address.
change in the contact person at the holder or agent.
change in the subject of the DMF.
change in the type of DMF
Categories of Amendments (Supporting Documents) in Original Submission:

Category: Quality

Subcategories under Quality Category (with corresponding CTD Sections, where applicable).

Changes to a Subsection e.g. changes in Control of Materials (S.2.3) not specifically listed below should be reported as the next level up e.g. should be reported as Manufacture Information S.2.

New item: Additional item e.g. flavor added to a multi-item DMF
Controls Information (specifications) S.4 and P.5
Dissolution Data (Usually applies to drug product only) P.5
Facility Information (changes in manufacturing and or testing sites) S.2.1 and P.3.1
Formulation Information (Usually applies to drug product only) P.1 and related sections
Lot Release (batch analysis) S.4.4 and P.5.4
Manufacture Information S.2 and P.3
Microbiology Information
New Strength (Usually applies to drug product only) P.1 and related sections
Quality (Not covered by other subcategories)
Packaging Information (Applies to packaging of the material that is the subject of the DMF e.g. plastic bags for packaging a bulk drug substance in a Type II DMF) S.6 and P.7
Stability Information S.7 and P.8
Response to Information Request
Response to Deficiency Letter

Category: Non-clinical
Non-clinical
Carcinogenicity Information
A response to an Overdue Notice Letter (ONL) to retain activity of a DMF MUST be identified as an Annual Report (with additional amendments as applicable) and contain the information listed below for an Annual Report. Responses to ONLs that are not labeled as Annual Reports or that state that an update will be submitted in the future are NOT sufficient to keep the DMF in active status.

FDA does not acknowledge, whether via e-mail or letter, any submission after the original DMF.

Submissions that cover multiple DMFs MUST have a copy submitted for each DMF.

When a company changes one part of a DMF, they should not resubmit the entire DMF. For DMFs in CTD format, the company should resumbit the entire changed “Document” (Section)—e.g., a change in the material used in the synthesis requires that the company resumbit ''Section S.2.3.''

All submissions must be paginated within the submission. For DMFs in CTD format, the company only resubmits the entire changed “Document” (Section)—e.g., a change in the material used in the synthesis requires resubmitting ''Section S.2.3.''

Pages that replace an already-numbered page from a previous submission should also contain the page number in the current submission (e.g. a page replacing Page 10 in the original submission may be page 14 in the new submission). For DMFs in CTD format, only the pages within the changed “Document” (Section) are subject to re-numbering.`

No pages are ever physically replaced in a DMF.

===Electronic DMFs (Category 3)===
At this time, the FDA doesn't ''require'' that companies file DMFs electronically. They continue to accept paper DMFs. Beginning May 5, 2017 new DMFs and submissions to existing DMFs must be submitted using the eCTD standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM511231.pdf |title=Forms|website=fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; See Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD)'

All electronic submissions must have a pre-assigned number to populate in the US regional.xml. If a company converts a paper DMF to electronic format, they don't need to request a pre-assigned number.

See also Guidance for Industry: Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format—Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications. To make sure you have the most recent versions of the specifications referenced in this guidance please check Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD). Companies are encouraged to submit their DMFs in electronic form, including updating current paper DMFs. Note that all applications to CDER, including DMFs that are submitted in electronic format MUST be in ECTD format, unless a waiver is granted. Waivers are not granted for DMFs.

All Letters of Authorization for electronic DMFs should specify that the DMF has been submitted in electronic format. A company may not submit an electronic resubmission to a paper DMF unless they resubmit the entire DMF in electronic format. Companies may convert an existing DMF in paper format to electronic format (ECTD only). See “Conversion to CTD” above.

The ECTD format provides the backbone for the submission, and a guide as to where to place information. Companies need not submit all modules, nor submit all sections within a module. However, the FDA requires Module 1 for all eCTD submissions, as it contains the administrative information that identifies the DMF. Electronic signatures are accepted for electronic DMFs.

===Letters of authorization (Category 2)===
The company must submit two copies of all letters of authorization (LOAs) to the DMF. The DMF holder must then send a copy of the LOA to the authorized party (company or individual authorized to incorporate the DMF by reference). Failure to submit the LOA to the DMF may delay review of the DMF. LOAs must specify the name of the specific item referenced, and the date of the submission of information about that item. The LOA must not be called a ''letter of access.'' An LOA is required, even if the DMF holder is the same company as the authorized party.

Companies must not submit LOAs with original paper DMFs, because the LOA must contain the DMF number. Therefore, DMF holders must wait to submit an LOA until they receive an acknowledgment letter with the DMF number. An LOA can be submitted with the original DMF if the DMF has received a pre-assigned number. It is not necessary to reissue LOAs if there have been no changes in the holder, authorized party, subject of the DMF or item referenced.

If the holder or authorized party changes names, whether this represents a change in ownership or not, they should submit new LOAs to the DMF and copies sent to the authorized party.

LOA Template
AGENTS (Category 2)

There is no regulatory requirement for an agent for any DMF, foreign or domestic. An agent for DMF purposes is not the same as an agent for the purposes of the Drug Listing and Registration System. (DRLS). Holders should not include the name of the agent for Registration purposes in the DMF. Also note that in the US, the process of “Registration” applies ONLY to “registering” an establishment with the FDA.

All “Agent Appointment Letters” for DMFs MUST be sent by the holder. FDA recommends that such letters include the phrase “appoint AGENT NAME as the agent for DMF” rather than “authorize AGENT NAME to act as the agent for DMF,” since the latter can be confused with a “Letter of Authorization.”
An “Agent Appointment Letter” may be included in an original DMF.

If possible, the word “Agent” should be used for the legal entity (whether a company or an individual) who is authorized to act on behalf of the DMF holder. The word “Representative” should be used for an individual who is employed by the Agent or Holder as the contact point for FDA.

If a company acting as an Agent changes its name, FDA recommends that the DMF holder issue a new Agent Appointment Letter.

A different agent can be appointed for different DMFs submitted by the same holder.

Agent Appointment Template
HOLDER NAMES (Category 2)

When the company that owns a DMF (DMF holder) changes its name, whether through sale of the company or simply a change in the company’s name, the DMF holder must notify FDA. See Section VII.E. in the Guideline for DMFs for further recommendations on the procedure for transferring ownership. A change in the name of a company for registration purposes under DRLS will not change the DMF holder name.

When a DMF is transferred from one company to another, the original holder should submit an administrative amendment stating that they are TRANSFERRING the DMF to the new holder. The new holder should then submit an administrative amendment stating that they are ACCEPTING the DMF from the former holder.

If the DMF holder changes its name and there is no transfer of ownership, the holder may submit a single Holder Name Change amendment.

A DMF holder is expected to retain a complete reference copy that is identical to, and maintained in the same chronological order as, their submissions to FDA (See Section IV.D.1 in the Guideline for DMFs). Therefore, the old owner of the DMF is expected to transfer that copy to the new owner of the DMF.

If a holder name change affects multiple DMFs, all documentation must be submitted to each DMF as separate submissions.

In general, the FDA expects that the manufacturer is the holder. If a manufacturer (company A) of a material wants another company (Company B) to submit the DMF, and Company B wishes to act as the holder—the DMF must include statements from both companies that Company B is responsible for all information in the DMF, and for all processes and testing performed by the manufacturer. The title of the DMF that appears on the list of DMFs is the format ''Material manufactured in [LOCATION OF COMPANY A] for [COMPANY B].''

ANNUAL REPORTS (Category 2)

According to the DMF Guideline, companies must not use annual reports to report changes in the DMF. However, as described above, companies can submit an annual report at the same time as other information. The annual report must contain (for cover letter see Templates below):

1. An administrative page that contains:

: Holder name
: Manufacturing site name if different from holder
: U.S. agent company name (if applicable)
: Name of contact person for each of the above
: Mailing address, phone number, fax and email address of responsible individuals
: AND 2. One of the following

: Date(s) of the amendment(s) reporting changes since the last Annual Report or the original DMF filing date, whichever is most recent.

: Or

: A statement that no amendments have been submitted since the last Annual Report or the original DMF filing date, whichever is most recent.
: And

: 3. One of the following:

: A complete list of all parties authorized to make reference to the DMF, identifying by name, reference number, volume, date, and page number the information that each person is authorized to incorporate

: Or

: A statement that no changes have been made to the list of authorized parties since the last annual report or the original DMF filing date, whichever is most recent.

: Or

: A statement that there are no authorized parties.

: And 
: 4. List of all parties whose authorization has been withdrawn

Note that the DMF Guidance uses the terms “Annual Update” and “Annual Report” interchangeably. All submissions of Annual Reports should be labeled “Annual Report.” The term “Annual Update” should not be used.

Note that the annual report must list the authorized parties. If the list is long and the holder wants to list only authorized parties added since the last annual report, they should highlight this in the cover letter. There should be a statement that there have been no changes in the list of authorized parties previously submitted.

BIOLOGICS MASTER FILES (Category 3)

Master Files submitted in support of products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) must be submitted as BB-MFs. See the CBER web site for the products regulated by CBER.

 BINDERS (Category 2)

See ”FDA IND, NDA, ANDA, or Drug Master File Binders
“The “binders” are actually covers. These may be ordered from the

U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO)
Washington, DC 20404-0001
(202) 512-1800

In addition these can be ordered online using the following links

Red Binder
Blue Binder
One copy of the DMF should use the blue cover and one should use the red cover.

Fasteners must be obtained separately. Use 2 Piece Prong Fasteners, 8 1/2" Center to Center, 3 1/2" Capacity. Binders should be used for all subsequent submissions to FDA that are more than 10 pages.

FEES (Category 3)

There are no fees or charges for filing a DMF or any subsequent documents.

FORMS (Category 2)

Certain forms are required for submission of NDAs and INDs. However, there are no forms required or available for DMFs, except for the forms discussed above under Binders.

CONFIDENTIALITY OF DMFs (Category 2)

The public availability of the contents of DMFs is covered in 21 CFR 314.430(e). All requests for information about DMFs beyond that provided in the tables above must be made through the CDER Freedom of Information Web site.
FILING DMFs AND PATENT EXPIRATION AND EXCLUSIVITY ISSUES (Category 2)

DMFs may be filed at any time. The Patent Expiration date and the Exclusivity Expiration dates listed in the Orange Book have no impact on DMF filing. The submission of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) that reference DMFs are subject to the regulations regarding filing of ANDAs.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS (Category 2) Since DMFs are neither approved nor disapproved, there is no need to file an Environmental Assessment. However the DMF should contain a commitment by the firm that its facilities will be operated in compliance with applicable environmental laws.

REORGANIZATION OF A DMF (Category 1)
The advice in the Guidance does not apply. It is not necessary to consult with FDA before reorganizing a DMF.

REQUEST FOR CLOSURE OF A DMF BY THE HOLDER (Category 2).

It is not necessary to include a statement that "the holder's obligations as detailed in Section VII have been fulfilled," as recommended in the DMF Guidance. It is sufficient to include a statement that all of the parties authorized to reference the DMF have been notified that the DMF is being closed..

LETTER TEMPLATES AND COVER LETTERS (Category 2)

Note that a “Transmittal Letter” and a “Cover Letter” are the same thing.

Cover Letter for Original DMFs
Cover Letter for Subsequent Amendments and Annual Reports (Not applicable to Holder Transfer, New Holder Acceptance, Holder Name Change, Letter of Authorization, and Closure Requests)

Cover Letter for Reactivation of a Closed Drug Master File
The following Letters do not require a Cover Letter

Holder Transfer
New Holder Acceptance
Holder Name Change
Letter of Authorization
Closure Request
Withdrawal of Authorization

== Controversies ==

In March 2017, Swiss police arrested Arnoux upon his arrival at Geneva Airport for risk of flight. A criminal trial was opened against him for "fraud, forgery, disloyal management, effective assets diminution at the expense of creditors, wrongful management, fraudulent bankruptcy, breach of the obligation to hold an accountancy and serious breach of the law on withholding taxes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2017/03/30/un-promoteur-villas-luxe-arrete-geneve|title=Un promoteur de villas de luxe a été arrêté à Genève|access-date=2017-06-29|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 20 years, Arnoux reportedly accumulated a debt of about 200 to 300 million euros.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tdg.ch/suisse/La-justice-met-la-main-sur-un-promoteur-prevenu-d-escroquerie/story/29937097|title=La justice met la main sur un promoteur prévenu d'escroquerie|work=tdg.ch/|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/luxembourg/le-quotidien-luxembourg/20170407/281526520909001|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ledauphine.com/haute-savoie/2017/04/03/le-promoteur-eric-arnoux-en-detention-provisoire-a-geneve-uwtn|title=Le promoteur Éric Arnoux en détention provisoire à Genève|access-date=2018-06-30|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Tribune de Genève'', "The idea was to lure wealthy people with over-valued and over-indebted goods, which he could not sell anymore, by making them appear juicy."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tdg.ch/geneve/actu-genevoise/promoteur-sulfureux-viseur-justice/story/14032325|title=Un promoteur sulfureux dans le viseur de la justice|work=tdg.ch/|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst its victims, ''[[Le Temps]]'' mentions [[J.

On 11 April 2018, Catherine Fortier became the first victim of Eric Arnoux to publicly speak about her suffering on French national TV [[France 2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lyon-entreprises.com/News/L-article-du-jour/A-l-invitation-de-60-000-rebonds-Michel-Noir-va-raconter-comment-il-a-su-rebondir-i81591.html|title=A l'invitation de " 60 000 rebonds ", Michel Noir va raconter comment il a su rebondir...|last=Entreprises|first=Lyon|website=www.lyon-entreprises.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=60000 Rebonds|title=Reportage Télématin 60 000 Rebonds - Tribunal de commerce de Lyon|date=2018-04-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJX0hb7jrhw|accessdate=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explained how Arnoux failed to pay her back 150,000 euros to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.monatelierpartage.com/blog/2017/5/15/lhomme-qui-plant-mon-entreprise|title=L'homme qui a "planté" mon entreprise|work=Mon atelier partagé|access-date=2018-06-30|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explained how Arnoux failed to pay her back 150,000 euros which bankrupted her company Zebranos SARL.

'''Finished goods''' are [[Good (economics and accounting)|goods]] that have completed the [[manufacturing]] process but have not yet been sold or distributed to the end user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accountingtools.com/definition-finished-goods-inve |title=Finished Goods Inventory |accessdate=2016-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
[[File:Air New Zealand Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner landing at Perth Airport.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Air New Zealand]] [[Boeing_787_Dreamliner#787-9|Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner]] is an example of a finished good.]]
{{Main|Manufacturing}}
Manufacturing has three classes of [[inventory]]:

# [[Raw material]]
# [[Work in process]]
# Finished goods

A good purchased as a "raw material" goes into the manufacture of a product.  A good only partially completed during the manufacturing process is called "work in process".  When the good is completed as to manufacturing but not yet sold or distributed to the end-user, it is called a "finished good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gill |first1=Suveera |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbJDDAAAQBAJ&amp;dq |title=Cost and Management Accounting: Fundamentals and its Applications |publisher=Vikas Publishing House |year=2015 |page=118 |isbn=978-9325990326 |accessdate=2016-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is the last stage for the processing of goods. The goods are ready to be consumed or distributed.
There is no processing required in term of the goods after this stage by the seller. Though there maybe instance that seller finished goods become buyer’s raw materials

Finished goods is a relative term. In a [[Supply chain management]] flow, the finished goods of a [[vendor (supply chain)|supplier]] can constitute the raw material of a [[buyer]].

The CIO is responsible for explaining to executive management the complex nightmare this industry has gotten itself into over the past 40 years and why equipment must be constantly retrofitted or replaced. Justifying new expenditures can be a difficult part of the job.

Increasingly, CIOs are involved in creating business and [[e-business]] opportunities through information technology. Collaborating with other executives, CIOs are often working at the core of business development within the organization.

'''Fractional CIO's''' differ from traditional CIO's in that they serve as a working member of a company's executive management team as a contractor and may-or-may-not serve on the company's [[board of directors]]. 

A Fractional CIO, also known as a Part-Time CIO, Parachute CIO, or CIO on-demand is an experienced, multi-faceted professional who serves as the part-time chief information officer of a small or medium-sized business that otherwise could not afford or would not need a full-time executive to hold the position of chief information officer. A [[Virtual CIO]] or vCIO may have a similar role but the term virtual suggests that the individual is not present in the organisation on the same basis as an employed executive. An Interim CIO is generally retained for a limited time period, often to oversee a specific project or to cover an interregnum.  As with traditional CIO's, a Fractional CIO often helps with Technology Roadmaps, Business Process Improvements, and Business Technology Strategy. 

The key business benefit of retaining a Fractional CIO is that they provide the same expertise and capability of a full-time CIO without the associated level of overhead and benefits associated with adding another top level executive. Care, however, must be taken to ensure the skills of the fractional CIO align primarily with the needs of the business, and not weighted with technical expertise in order to achieve the best results.

Fractional CIOs typically serve several companies and may-or-may-not engage in the day-to-day management of a company's [[Information technology|IT]] staff or other resources.

Trade barriers are restrictions on [[international trade]] that are put in place by the government. They are typically looked at as negative for the economy. This is because  barriers that restrict the flow of goods tend to raise the price of said good.However, there are many different types of trade barriers that can effect global trading such as [[Tariff|tariffs]], quotas and regulatory barriers.   

== Types of Trade Barriers ==

=== Tariffs ===
The most common barrier to trade is the tariff barrier. Tariffs typically are higher than average taxes on imported goods. These taxes are put in place by the government in hopes to raises revenue and for protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/us/dictionary/english/tariff-barriers|title=Tariff barriers definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countries and their trade barriers ==

=== United States of America ===
In the last five or so year the United States has been dealing with the implication's of [https://ustr.gov/trade-topics/localization-barriers Localization Barriers]. These barriers are put in place to benefit the domestic industries that the U.S deals with. They place restrictions on not only peoples goods and services but also their [[Intellectual property]]. This practice is widely though after to have a negative affect on ones economy so the U.S tends to try and stay away from it. Also, the jury is still out on whether or not this barriers align with the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/trade-topics/localization-barriers|title=Localization Barriers to Trade {{!}} United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== United States Trade Partners ====
[[United Kingdom]] and the U.S

* U.K Exported 65,729 Million dollars worth of goods in 2016 to the U.S.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/reports-and-publications/2018/2018-national-trade-estimate|title=2018 National Trade Estimate Report {{!}} United States Trade Representative|website=ustr.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
While being one of the larger countries the U.K has very little in the ways of trade barriers. Different from the U.S the U.K must follow the rules of the [[European Union|E.U]]. With that said, the few barriers that the U.K does have tend to be because of the rules they need to follow for being a part of the E.U.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.export.gov/article?id=United-Kingdom-Trade-Barriers|title=United Kingdom - Trade Barriers {{!}} export.gov|website=www.export.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gregory Paul Potter'''&lt;ref name="Bails" /&gt; is an [[Americans|American]] [[comic book]] writer best known for co-creating the [[DC Comics]] series ''[[Jemm|Jemm, Son of Saturn]]'' with artist [[Gene Colan]].

==Biography==
Greg Potter began writing comics stories for [[Warren Publishing]]'s black-and-white [[horror comics]] magazines in 1971, while still a teenager.&lt;ref name="Nossiter"&gt;{{Citation|last = Nossiter|first = Alf|title = The Harlem Globetrotter|journal= [[Amazing Heroes]]|issue= 50|page = 39|publisher = [[Fantagraphics Books]]|date = July 1, 1984|location= Seattle, Washington|quote = Greg Potter first sold mystery stories to DC and Warren when he was a teenager, but he quit that when he began attending Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. Since graduating, he has taught business writing at the Harvard Business School.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first work for DC Comics was the seven-page short story "Do You Believe In...?" published in ''[[House of Mystery]]'' #259 (July–Aug. 1978).&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb|type=writer|search= Greg+Potter|title= Greg Potter}}&lt;/ref&gt; His story "Papa Don" in ''[[Secrets of Haunted House]]'' #17 (Oct. 1979) was included in DC's "Top Ten Stories of 1979" collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Gcdb issue|id= 34343/#206523|title= ''The Best of DC'' #5 (May–June 1980)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stopped writing comics while attending [[Trinity College, Hartford|Trinity College]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]],&lt;ref name="Nossiter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bails"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailsprojects.com/(S(ykblxwjwy5f50155b1wyg345))/bio.aspx?Name=POTTER%2c+GREG |title=Potter, Greg|first=Jerry|last=Bails|authorlink=Jerry Bails|year=2006|work=Who's Who of American Comic Books 1928–1999|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140102012440/http://www.bailsprojects.com/%28S%28ykblxwjwy5f50155b1wyg345%29%29/bio.aspx?Name=POTTER%2C+GREG|archivedate=January 2, 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=October 12, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; but returned to the industry in 1984. That year, Potter created [[Jemm]], a character originally conceived as the cousin of the [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] [[superhero]] the [[Martian Manhunter]], a long-running character that had not been in use for some time. Partway through developing the series, Potter was told by editor [[Janice Race]] that the Martian Manhunter character would reappear in the ''[[Justice League|Justice League of America]]'' title.&lt;ref&gt;Nossiter p. 36 "I originally wrote the first six issues on the basis that he was from Mars, and that he was going to be a cousin of J'Onn J'Onzz. Then Janice calls me one day and says he can't be from Mars any more because [J'Onn J'Onzz is] coming back in the ''Justice League''.&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid any [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] problems, Potter rewrote the series as ''Jemm, Son of Saturn'', a character with no connection to the Martian Manhunter. The series was [[penciler|penciled]] by Gene Colan and [[inker|inked]] by [[Klaus Janson]] and [[Bob McLeod (comics)|Bob McLeod]]. The Jemm character appeared in the "[[Human for a Day]]" episode of the ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'' television series in 2015 and was portrayed by actor [[Charles Halford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title= Human for a Day|episode-link= Human for a Day|series= Supergirl|series-link= Supergirl (TV series)|credits= Chang, Yahlin and [[Ted Sullivan (filmmaker)|Sullivan, Ted]] (writers); [[Larry Teng|Teng, Larry]] (director)|network= [[CBS]]|air-date= December 7, 2015|season= 1|number= 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Motor Show Germany''' or simply '''International Motor Show''', in German known as the '''''Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung''''' (''IAA'' - International Automobile Exhibition), is the world's largest [[motor show]]. It is held annually, with passenger vehicles (including some motorcycles) being displayed in odd-numbered years in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and commercial vehicles in even-numbered years in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]]. Before 1991 the show was held solely in Frankfurt.

The IAA is organized by the ''[[Verband der Automobilindustrie]]'' (VDA&amp;nbsp;– Association of the German Automotive Industry) and is scheduled by the [[Organisation Internationale des Constructeurs d'Automobiles]]. Currently, the show in Frankfurt occupies twelve buildings.

==History==
In 1897 the first IAA was held at the Hotel Bristol in [[Berlin]], with a total of eight motor vehicles on display.&lt;ref name=1st-iaa&gt;{{cite web|title=IAA: Frankfurt International Car Show|url=http://www.around-germany.com/1655/iaa-frankfurt-international-car-show/|publisher=Around-Germany.com|accessdate=2014-10-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018150648/http://www.around-germany.com/1655/iaa-frankfurt-international-car-show/|archivedate=2014-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the automobile became more known and accepted, the IAA became a fixed event in Germany, with at least one held every year, usually in Berlin. From 1905-1907, there were two per year, as the production had increased to an industrial level. In the next years the show was suspended due to the ongoing [[World War I]], and was then reinstated in 1921 with 67 automobile manufacturers displaying 90 vehicles under the motto "comfort".

Despite the still perceptible after-effects of the global recession, the 22nd IAA was held in Berlin in 1931, with a total of 295,000 visitors. For the first time the exhibition included [[front-wheel drive]] vehicles. In 1939, the 29th installation of the event gathered a total of 825,000 visitors - an all-time record at that time. The new [[Volkswagen]] was presented for the first time, which later came to be known as the [[Volkswagen Beetle|Beetle]]. This was the last IAA before it was again suspended during [[World War II]]. From 1947-1949, Germany’s automobile and accessories manufacturers took part in the export trade fair in [[Hanover]]. The automobile industry’s hall acted like a magnet on the public, with a great number of visitors coming to the show. In 1951 the show was held on the [[Messe Frankfurt]] for the first time. The event, which was held in April, attracted a total of 570,000 visitors, with exhibits including the first [[Large goods vehicle|HGV]] to have a [[turbo diesel]] engine. Just six months later, in September 1951, a second exhibition in Berlin was held, gathering 290,000 visitors. From then on, the German automobile industry bade farewell to its traditional exhibition site in Berlin and relocated the motor show completely to Frankfurt. The IAA was also rescheduled to only take place every other year.

In 1989 the last IAA to feature both passenger cars and commercial vehicles in one show confirmed that the exhibition site in Frankfurt was now too small for this major event. Almost 2,000 exhibitors squeezed onto an exhibition site measuring 252,000 square metres. More than 1.2 million visitors attended the event. Because of the high demand, it was no longer possible to meet exhibitors’ requirements for adequate exhibition stands. In view of this, the [[Verband der Automobilindustrie|VDA]] decided to split the IAA from now on, with a focus on passenger vehicles in odd years, and a focus on commercial vehicles in even years. The first IAA focused solely on "passenger cars", held in 1991, was a huge success. A total of 1,271 exhibitors from 43 countries displayed their new products and innovations. With more than 935,000 visitors, the IAA Passenger Cars was extremely well attended. In 1992 the first IAA "commercial vehicles" took place in [[Hanover]], [[Germany]]. It saw 1,284 exhibitors from 29 countries and gathered 287,000 people, 66 per cent being trade visitors.

In 2001 the [[September 11 attacks]] on the World Trade Center in New York cast a shadow over the IAA in Frankfurt. The exhibition went ahead all the same. As a mark of solidarity with the victims and their dependants, all show elements and loud music as well as the official opening ceremony with the Federal Chancellor were cancelled. VDA President Gottschalk explained this decision: "Because we could not permit terrorist forces to take away our freedom of action. And because, as a key international sector, we have a responsibility not to allow things to grind to a halt." In an impressive manner, the general public confirmed that this indeed was the right decision to take: More than 800,000 people visited this "quiet IAA".

During the [[Great Recession]], in 2009, the IAA Cars proved to be a magnet for visitors. Around 850,000 people visited the IAA, which greatly exceeded the target of 750,000. This IAA, which took place under the headline "A Moving Experience", showed where the mobility of tomorrow is heading. A huge number of options were presented at the IAA, ranging from the mild hybrid and the plug-in hybrid to the all-electric car, fuel cells and hydrogen power.

In 2011 the 63rd IAA featured the all-new "Hall of Electric Mobility", a first-timer to all Motor Shows worldwide. Additional IAA-premieres included the Electric Mobility Conference as well as the CarIT Conference dealing with the issue of connected driving.

====Hybrids====
European automakers demonstrated a new interest in hybrid and electric vehicles at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show. For example, Mercedes-Benz arrived at the show with seven hybrids, including a luxury sedan concept vehicle called the F 700, a {{convert|17|ft|m|sing=on}}-long car that achieves a fuel economy of 44.4 miles per gallon (mpg). The research vehicle features a homogenous charge compression ignition engine, a technology that produces the high fuel economy of a diesel engine from a clean-burning gasoline engine. Mercedes has also mated its clean-diesel engine to an electric motor, creating the [[Bluetec]] hybrid. The company plans to introduce a gasoline-fueled hybrid SUV and sedan in 2009, followed by two Bluetec hybrids in 2010, one of which will achieve 51 miles per gallon of diesel fuel. In addition, the Mercedes Car Group exhibited its smart car in three new incarnations: an electric-only vehicle and both diesel and gasoline versions with "micro hybrid drive", a belt-driven starter and alternator that allows the engine to shut off at stops. See the DaimlerChrysler press releases about the auto show and the F700.

[[Opel]], a subsidiary of [[General Motors]], unveiled the [[Opel Flextreme|Flextreme]], a [[plug-in hybrid]] that can travel {{convert|34|mi|km}} on its [[lithium-ion battery]] before a small diesel engine starts charging the battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/10/officially-official-opel-flextreme-concept-40g-km-of-co2-and|title=Officially Official: Opel Flextreme Concept - 40g/km of CO2 and two Segways in the trunk!|publisher=Autoblog.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110210116/http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/10/officially-official-opel-flextreme-concept-40g-km-of-co2-and/|archivedate=2016-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Opel also unveiled the [[Opel Corsa|Corsa Hybrid]], a coupe that combines a belt-driven starter and alternator with a lithium-ion battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/08/22/frankfurt-preview-opel-corsa-hybrid-concept|title=Frankfurt Preview: Opel Corsa Hybrid concept|publisher=Autoblog.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110210116/http://www.autoblog.com/2007/08/22/frankfurt-preview-opel-corsa-hybrid-concept/|archivedate=2016-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Volvo Cars]], a division of [[Ford Motor Company]], exhibited a plug-in hybrid with motors in each of the wheels. The [[Volvo ReCharge]] can travel about {{convert|60|mi|km}} on battery power alone, using a [[lithium-polymer battery]] pack that can be recharged in a standard outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/06/frankfurt-preview-volvo-recharge-the-swedes-go-series-hybrid|title=Frankfurt Preview: Volvo ReCharge - The Swedes go series hybrid|publisher=Autoblog.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110210116/http://www.autoblog.com/2007/09/06/frankfurt-preview-volvo-recharge-the-swedes-go-series-hybrid/|archivedate=2016-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=25873 |title=New Ford Small Car Concept Debuts at Frankfurt Motor Show |publisher=Ford |location=US |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011194608/http://media.ford.com/newsroom/feature_display.cfm?release=25873 |date=2007-08-24 |archivedate=2007-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show can best be summed up in one word: "[[electrification]]" Virtually every manufacturer has unveiled a vehicle using the latest battery technology,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Eisenstein |first=Paul A. |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32970517/ |title=Europeans ready to plug into electric vehicles&amp;nbsp;– Business&amp;nbsp;– Autos&amp;nbsp;– The Driver Seat&amp;nbsp;– msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2010-12-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215235502/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32970517 |archivedate=2011-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 show took place from 10 September to 22 September.

[[Nissan]] introduced a "smart watch" that measures the user's heart rate, temperature and other biometrics. It is also able to keep a watch on car data like fuel efficiency and average speed. It was developed by Nissan's [[Nismo]] laboratory. They currently capture live [[biometric]] and [[telematics]] data from Nissan racing cars and their drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23964797|title=Nissan launches driver's smartwatch|first=Jane|last=Wakefield|date=2013-09-09|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910051229/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23964797|archivedate=2013-09-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Israel Bonds, Tapoohi held director positions on the boards of leading Israeli and international companies, including [[Bezeq]], Israel’s largest telecommunications provider, and [[Africa-Israel Investments]] Ltd., an international holdings and investments group.

Tapoohi, a certified accountant by training, began his professional career in 1970 at the Australian branch of [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation]]. In 1972, he joined the Australian subsidiary of Dutch company [[Philips Electronics]].

==Israel==
Following his emigration in 1979,Tapoohi joined the auditing firm Luboshitz-Kasierer &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luboshitz-Kasierer|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=2396813|work=Businessweek Information on Luboshitz-Kasierer|publisher=Businessweek|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Tapoohi was accepted to the Institute of Certified Public Accountants in Israel.

Three years later, he was appointed chief financial officer and company secretary of Pioneer Israel – one of the country’s 100 largest companies – operator of concrete plants, quarries, asphalt plants and vehicles to transport raw materials for construction. Tapoohi was also involved in the activities of the parent company, Pioneer International, dealing with international financing, dividend planning, and acquisition of businesses, particularly during the privatization process in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel Tapoohi profile Bezeq Chairman|url=http://www.news1.co.il/Archive/006-D-1147-00.html|work=News 1|publisher=News1|accessdate=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure at Bezeq, Israel’s largest communications provider, and, at the time, the country’s largest corporation, Tapoohi guided the company through increasing competition in the international telecommunications market and began preparations for the telecom giant’s privatization, completed in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dun's 100 Israel's Largest Enterprises|url=http://duns100.dundb.co.il/ts.cgi?tsscript=comp_eng&amp;duns=600004386|work=Bezeq Profile|publisher=Dun &amp; Bradstreet Israel Ltd.|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2000, Tapoohi founded InQSOFT, which evaluated and recommended investments in early-stage high-tech startups to top-level international investors. Tapoohi was InQSOFT CEO until 2004.

, [[Paz Oil Company]] Ltd.[http://www.paz.co.il/en/about.asp]
, and Paz Ashdod Refinery Ltd.

In early 2007, Tapoohi, together with a number of prominent Israeli business leaders, established More Group International Real Estate, which developed real estate in Eastern Europe, primarily [[Montenegro]].

In June 2010, Tapoohi was appointed chairman of Tel Aviv Centennial Properties Ltd., a company investing in and managing retail properties in central [[Tel Aviv]].

==Public Service==
Tapoohi has held a number of key advisory positions, all of which were on a volunteer basis. From 1996 to 1999 he was [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s liaison to foreign investors and coordinated the think-tank that advised the prime minister’s office on economic policy.

During this same period, Tapoohi was the [[Likud Party]] treasurer, also on a voluntary basis, from May 1993 through April 1997, and, in 1998, co-chaired the 50th Anniversary Jubilee Conference for Business Investment in Israel. [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-15011577.html]

As part of the formation of the second [[Netanyahu]] government in March 2009, Tapoohi was appointed to the '100 Days Team.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keinon|first=Herb|title=New gov't to tackle economy, security|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=135279|accessdate=6 June 2011|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=2009-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Finance Minister [[Yuval Steinitz]], Tapoohi developed guidelines and policies to keep Israel's economy resilient in the face of ongoing global recession. From May 2009 to May 2011, Tapoohi was part of a forum of businessmen, economists and academics advising the Finance Ministry on macro-economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Remaking Israel. Will rolling back state control double the economy's size?|url=http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1997/b3514085.arc.htm|accessdate=6 June 2011|newspaper=Businessweek|date=1997-02-17|author=Rossant, John|author2=Sandler, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tapoohi was a member of the Council and Advisory Committee of the [[Bank of Israel]] and the Committee of the Association of Publicly Listed Companies on the [[Tel Aviv Stock Exchange]].
He also sat on the [[Weizmann Institute]]'s board of governors.

Tapoohi was a member of the directorate of the Israel-Australia Chamber of Commerce, the Israel-Switzerland Chamber of Commerce, and the Israel-British Business Council. Through December 2010, Tapoohi was a member of the directorate of the Israel-British Chamber of Commerce, and, from 2004 to 2006, was a member of the Israel-America Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chamber Members|url=http://www.amcham.co.il/chambermembers|publisher=Israel-America Chamber of Commerce|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel Bonds==
Following a recommendation from then-Finance Minister Steinitz, the board of directors of Development Corporation for Israel approved Tapoohi's appointment as president and CEO.  He officially began his new role October 31, 2011.

During his time with the organization, Tapoohi stressed the strength of Israel's economy.  In an interview published November 4, 2014, on Bloomberg.com, Tapoohi said, “It’s an economic narrative that we’re giving today, and not a geopolitical one.”

The Bloomberg article noted Tapoohi’s use of technology to assist Bonds registered representatives in  increasing annual U.S. sales.  In 2013 and ’14, domestic sales exceeded $1.1 billion, with reinvestment rates of approximately 60 percent. U.S. sales again exceeded $1 billion in 2015.
 
Previously, in an op-ed published in the January 8, 2014 issue of the [[Jerusalem Post]], Tapoohi wrote: “Every day, Israel Bonds emphasizes the message that Israel’s economy is dynamic, full of innovative spirit and groundbreaking entrepreneurship. It is a message that has resonated with Israel Bonds clients from across the spectrum who invest in Israel bonds to become stakeholders in one of the world’s most resilient economies." [http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Israel-Bonds-A-record-breaking-strategic-asset-for-Israel-337529]

Prior to 2012, Tapoohi’s first full year with Israel Bonds, annual U.S. sales had remained in the $600 million range for several years. In his first year, sales topped $800 million, followed by three consecutive years (2013-2015) of domestic sales exceeding $1 billion.

He prioritized the organization’s digital presence, particularly its [[e-commerce]] site, which, since its launch in fall 2011, has resulted in over $125 million in sales to date, encompassing more than 50,000 bondholders. [http://www.israelbonds.com]
 
Together with the utilization of new technologies, Tapoohi ensured that the Bonds organization maintained personal contact with all clients via a national call center that proactively interacts with hundreds of clients each week, as well as through digital communication. He has also focused on enhanced levels of customer service.

Tapoohi also emphasized the need to attract a new generation to Israel Bonds, stating this was"a foremost priority" for the organization.

Additionally, he launched an initiative to counter anti-Israel activism on campus. Entitled ''"The Alternative BDS - '''B'''onds '''D'''onated to '''S'''chools," ''the program encouraged donations of Israel bonds to universities.''

==Personal life==
Tapoohi is married to Regina (formerly Lossak), who was a senior attorney at Israel’s Justice Ministry working the field of trans-border criminal law. In September 2013, she was named senior delegate to the UN on behalf of the International Association of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, and she continues to serve in that capacity on a volunteer basis.  She was elected to the association’s board of governors in November 2014. They have three daughters and one son.

'''Jane Sterk''' (born January 14, 1947) is a Canadian psychologist, businesswoman, academic, and politician. She is the former leader of the [[Green Party of British Columbia]] and a business professor at [[University Canada West]]. In the [[British Columbia general election, 2009|2009 British Columbia provincial election]] she was a candidate in the riding of [[Esquimalt-Royal Roads]] and in the [[British Columbia general election, 2013|2013 election]] was a candidate in [[Victoria-Beacon Hill]]. She was elected councillor in the Township of [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Esquimalt]] in 2005 was elected leader of the provincial Green Party in October 2007. In the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]] and the [[British Columbia general election, 2005|2005 provincial election]] as a candidate in the Esquimalt ridings, she placed fourth and third with 9% and 10% of the vote, respectively.

Before moving to Esquimalt in 1997, Sterk had lived in Edmonton. She earned a doctorate from the [[University of Alberta]] in [[counseling psychology]] and worked for [[Edmonton Public Schools]] and the Edmonton Board of Health. In 1983 she co-founded a business, Softwarehouse West, with a co-worker from the Board of Health. She sold computers, hardware, software, and related services until she retired to Esquimalt in 1997 intending to purchase a boat and sail recreationally. On August 13, 2013 Sterk announced she would resign as Green party leader.

==Before politics==
Jane Sterk was born and raised in [[Edmonton]] with her father, who worked as the dean of education at the [[University of Alberta]], and her mother, who was a [[pianist]].&lt;ref name= Westad&gt;{{cite news |first= Kim |last= Westand |title= Quest for Green Victory |work=[[Times-Colonist (Victoria)|Times-Colonist]] |location= [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] |date=December 30, 2007 |page= B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 20 years old, in 1967 she married a man named John, who went on to become a lawyer and author.&lt;ref name= Westad/&gt; Together they raised two sons. Sterk worked as a school teacher for [[Edmonton Public Schools]] for seven years.&lt;ref name=Computers&gt;{{cite news |title=  Women &amp; Computers |work=Edmonton Journal |date=November 26, 1994 |page= G1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the University of Alberta, she earned a master's degree in [[education]] and a doctorate in [[counseling psychology]].&lt;ref name=Harnett&gt;{{cite news |first= Cindy |last= Harnett |title= A messy battle ahead |work=[[Times-Colonist (Victoria)|Times-Colonist]] |location= [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] |date=June 22, 2004 |page= A11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She opened a private psychologist practice and worked for the Edmonton Board of Health.

In 1983, at 36 years old, she opened a computer store, Softwarehouse West, with Gary Ford, a co-worker from the Edmonton Board of Health.&lt;ref name=combination/&gt; After a difficult first year, the business grew.&lt;ref name= Chalmers/&gt; By 1990 they employed 33 others, had $6 million in annual revenue, and had won the 1989 Alberta  Small Business Owners of the Year award from the Chamber of Commerce.&lt;ref name=combination&gt;{{cite news |title= A winning combination |work=Edmonton Journal |date=October 23, 1989 |page= B8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Chalmers&gt;{{cite news |first= Ron |last= Chalmers |title= Modest beginnings shared by successful women |work=Edmonton Journal |date=January 24, 1990 |page= D14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 the business split off its information management section, with Sterk heading the new company, USConnect Edmonton.&lt;ref name=Computers/&gt;

After working for another five years, Sterk and her husband retired in 1997 and moved to [[Esquimalt, British Columbia]] with the intention of sailing around the world. The couple purchased a boat and trained how to sail. They sailed in 1999 and passed [[Cape Flattery (Washington)|Cape Flattery]] off the coast of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] before turning back due to [[seasickness]].&lt;ref name=Harnett/&gt; After further preparation, they successfully sailed to Mexico and back in 2001.&lt;ref name=Smyth&gt;{{cite news |first= Michael |last= Smyth |title= Doesn't matter who top Green is if vote split |work=[[The Province]] |location= [[Vancouver]] |date=October 23, 2007 |page= A8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Sterk got involved in Green Party politics following her trip to Mexico, where she witnessed [[Marine pollution|ocean pollution]] and rapid development causing environmental and social damage.&lt;ref name=Smyth/&gt; She understood that sustainable and responsible development could have avoided the damage.&lt;ref name= Westad/&gt; Sterk had never belonged to a political party before and had previously voted for parties across the political spectrum, depending on the specific candidates. She joined the Green Party in 2001.&lt;ref name= Westad/&gt; She ran as the [[Green Party of Canada]]'s candidate in the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]] for the [[Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca]] riding, where she came in fourth of six candidates, garnering 9.2% of the vote. She was the [[Green Party of British Columbia]]'s candidate in the [[British Columbia general election, 2005|May 2005 provincial election]] in the [[Esquimalt-Metchosin]] riding. Of the four candidates in the riding, she placed third with 10.4% of the vote.

Later that year she ran for a seat on the [[Esquimalt, British Columbia|Township of Esquimalt]]'s city council. As a councilor she supported pedestrian rights, urban farming and using biofuels in the city vehicle fleet.&lt;ref name=Palmer&gt;{{cite news |first= Vaughn |last= Palmer |title= B.C. Green party leader a practical, pragmatic, sure-footed politician |work=[[The Vancouver Sun]] |date=October 23, 2007 |page= A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as alternate director at the [[Capital Regional District]]. While she supported the construction of a regional sewage treatment plant, she, along with the other Esquimalt councilors, opposed locating the plant along the waterfront at Esquimalt's Macaulay Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Rob |last= Shaw |title= U.S. sewage plant impresses Esquimalt councillor |work=[[Times-Colonist (Victoria)|Times-Colonist]] |location= [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]] |date=August 10, 2007 |page= B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
Jennifer was born in rural Kenya, about {{convert|700|km|0}}, from [[Nairobi]], circa 1950s. She was the forth-born in a family with 10 children. She attended a primary school, about {{convert|4|km|0}}, from home, walking the distance barefoot, back and forth, every school day.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

She was admitted to [[Precious Blood Secondary School (Riruta)| Precious Blood High School]], an all-girls boarding school, administered by the religious order of the [[Sisters of the Precious Blood (Baden)|Sisters of the Precious Blood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preciousbloodriruta.com/content.php?pid=1 | title=Precious Blood Secondary School, Riruta |date=3 March 2018 |access-date=3 March 2018 |author=Prescious Blood Secondary School, Riruta |publisher=Preciousbloodriruta.com | location=Riruta}}&lt;/ref&gt; located in Nairobi, Kenya's capital and largest city. At the end of high school, Jennifer became pregnant.&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;

After delivering, she went on to study at the [[University of Dar es Salaam]], on scholarship, with her baby in tow. She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Education. She followed that with a [[Master of Arts]] degree in Education Administration from the [[University of Leeds]] in the United Kingdom. Later, she obtained a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in Women Education and Development, from the [[Kenyatta University]].&lt;ref name="One"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Two"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=3 March 2018 | url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/evewoman/article/2001253449/jennifer-riria-ceo-of-kenya-women-holding-limited |title=Jennifer Riria: CEO of Kenya Women Holding Limited |date=3 September 2017 |first=Anne |last=Kanake |newspaper=[[The Standard (Kenya)|East African Standard]] |location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Socialism sidebar|Ideas}}
'''Labour vouchers''' (also known as '''labour cheques''', '''labour certificates''' and '''personal credit''') are a device proposed to govern [[demand]] for [[goods]] in some models of [[socialism]] unlike [[money]] does under [[capitalism]].

== Outline ==
Unlike money, vouchers cannot circulate and are not transferable between people. They are also not exchangeable for any [[means of production]], hence they are not transmutable into [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Once a purchase is made, the labour vouchers are either destroyed or must be re-earned through labour. With such a system in place, monetary [[theft]] would become impossible.

Such a system is proposed by many as a replacement for traditional money while retaining a system of remuneration for work done. It is also a way of ensuring that there is no way to make money out of money as in a capitalist [[market economy]]. Additionally, the only kind of [[Market (economics)|market]] that could exist in an economy operating through the use of labour vouchers would be an [[artificial market]] (arket) for mostly non-productive goods and services. As with the dissolution of [[money]], [[capital market]]s could no longer exist and [[labour market]]s would also likely cease to exist with the abolition of [[wage labor]] which would by necessity occur with the adoption of vouchers.

Author and activist [[Michael Albert]] and economist [[Robin Hahnel]] have proposed a similar system of remuneration in their economic system of [[participatory economics]] (parecon). A difference is that in parecon credits are generally awarded based on both the time spent working and the amount of effort and sacrifice spent during labour, rather than simple contribution. Some later advocates of [[participism]] and parecon have also proposed awarding more based on job difficulty or danger. In contrast to the physical note or cheque format used for labour vouchers in the past, parecon credits are proposed as being entirely digital in keeping with advances with technology and are stored in electronic accounts and usable through cards similar to current day debit cards.

== History ==
Labour vouchers were first proposed in the 1820s by [[Josiah Warren]] and [[Robert Owen]]. Two early attempts at implementing labour vouchers (called labour notes at the time by their proponents) were made by both following their experiences attempting to establish a utopian community at [[New Harmony, Indiana]] in which currency was prohibited.

In 1827, Warren established the [[Cincinnati Time Store]] where goods could be purchased with labor vouchers representing an agreement to perform labor. However, he folded the store in 1830 in order to devote his effort to establishing communities that implemented his principles of labour-based prices.

Beginning in 1832, Owen and his followers attempted to implement labour notes in London and Glasgow by establishing marketplaces and banks that accepted them.

The followers of Owen stood for a society of co-operative communities. Each community would own its own means of production and each member of a community would work to produce what had been agreed was needed and in return would be issued with a labour voucher certifying for how many hours he or she had worked. A person could then use this labour voucher to obtain from the community's stock of consumer goods any product or products which had taken the same number of hours to produce.

Owen believed that this co-operative commonwealth could begin to be introduced under capitalism and in the first half of the 1830s some of his followers established labour bazaars on a similar principle in which workers brought the products of their labour to the bazaar and received in exchange a labour voucher that entitled them to take from the bazaar any item or items which had taken the same time to produce after taking into account the costs of the raw materials. These bazaars were ultimately failures, but the idea of labour vouchers appeared in substantially similar forms in France in the writings of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]].

Although he disagreed with the manner in which they were implemented by Owen, they were later advocated by [[Karl Marx]] as a way of dealing with immediate and temporary shortages upon the establishment of socialism. Marx explained that this would be necessary since socialism emerges from capitalism and would be "stamped with its birthmarks". In Marx's proposal, an early socialist society would reward its citizens according to [[To each according to his contribution|the amount of labour they contribute to society]]. In the ''[[Critique of the Gotha Programme]]'', Marx said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he individual producer receives back from society—after the deductions have been made—exactly what he gives to it. What he has given to it is his individual quantum of labour. For example, the social working day consists of the sum of the individual hours of work; the individual labour time of the individual producer is the part of the social working day contributed by him, his share in it. He receives a certificate from society that he has furnished such-and-such an amount of labour (after deducting his labour for the common funds); and with this certificate, he draws from the social stock of means of consumption as much as the same amount of labour cost. The same amount of labor which he has given to society in one form, he receives back in another.&lt;ref name="MarxGothaPartI"&gt;Karl Marx (1875). ''[[s:Critique of the Gotha Programme|Critique of the Gotha Programme]]''. [[s:Critique of the Gotha Programme/Part I|Part I]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Marx essentially refused the idea in the ''[[Poverty of Philosophy]]'', especially within the capitalism (I. chapter, 2. §). Marx stated that the time in itself separated from other's time doesot suitable to measure the value of work. The value "is constituted, not by the time needed to produce it by itself, but in relation to the quota of each and every other product which can be created at the same time" (3.§. A.). Marx opinion was that the introduction of labour voucher would create a lazy society and economy because there will not be concurrency between the employers and employees, so nobody could tell what is the optimal (minimal) time which needs to produce something. Generally, any working time doesn't equal to any other working time. Moreover what if "Peter" works 12 hours per day, meanwhile "Paul" works only 6 hours. This means that "Peter" worked 6 unnecessary hours and his labour vouchers worth for nothing as regards this +6 hours, not to mention other factors of the work. To summarize Marx's opinion in the ''Poverty of Philosophy'', the labour voucher is not suitable to create a new socialist society. The theory of Proudhon and other's is nothing more than a [[Utopian socialism|utopian]] apology of the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|existing capitalist system]]. By [[Friedrich Engels]], Proudhon himself tried to introduce the labour voucher system in 1849, but his attempt collapsed soon. Marx was adamant in saying that labour vouchers were not a form of money as they cannot circulate—a problem he pointed out with Owen's system of labour-time notes.

After the [[October Revolution]], the [[Bolshevik]]s were forced to let the direct production-exchange and gave valuless vouchers to the peasantry for the grain and the food-stuff which were confiscated by brutal force, but this method led to local rebellions and after all to the civil war. [[Vladimir Lenin]] never suggested introducing the labour voucher system in the industrial areas. No other socialist countries used later the labour voucher system. 

During the [[Great Depression]], European communities implemented local currencies with varying success. The aptly-named economist Sir [[Leo Chiozza Money]] advocated for a similar monetary scheme in his 1934 book ''Product Money'' (Methuen) with notes or certificates being issued for productive work and destroyed once exchanged for consumption goods. In [[Nazi Germany]], [[Adolf Hitler]] ([[Hjalmar Schacht[[ finance-minister and banker) applied a kind of labour-voucher named MEFO-bond, whose aim was to hide the rearmament program's expenditures before the Western world as the big trusts did not pay by money-transfer to each other, but bought MEFO bonds from the state and changed these bonds in closed circuit.

The following political and economic systems propose the adoption of labour vouchers (in some form or another) either permanently or as a temporary means of remuneration during a transitional stage between a monetary economy and a completely moneyless economy based on free association.
* [[Owenism]]
* [[Mutualism (economic theory)|Mutualism]]
* [[Collectivist anarchism]]
* [[DeLeonism]]
* [[Participism]]
* [[Inclusive Democracy]]

Inclusive Democracy is unique in proposing two kinds of vouchers. Basic vouchers issued to each citizen according to need are used for essential goods and services such as health care while non-basic vouchers awarded to each worker for labor contributed are used to pay for non-essential commercial goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Takis Fotopoulos (Spring Summer 2010). [http://www.inclusivedemocracy.org/journal/vol6/vol6_no2_takis_beyond_market_economy_and_statist_planning.htm "Beyond the Market Economy and Statist Planning: Towards Democratic Planning as part of a Confederal Inclusive Democracy"]. ''The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy''. Vol. 6. No. 2/3..&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
Capitalists—whether [[State capitalism|statist]], [[minarchist]], or [[anarcho-capitalist]]—generally oppose labour vouchers as they are not money and thus claim an economy using them could not set prices according to [[marginal utility]] and would theoretically have to rely on the [[labour theory of value]], which adherents of the [[subjective theory of value]] generally see as inflexible and restricting economic freedom of choice for the consumer. Some proposed systems which advocate labour vouchers, namely participism, reject the labour theory of value.

The system has also been criticized by many [[libertarian socialists]], particularly [[anarcho-communists]], who propose abolishing all remuneration and prices and advocate instead a [[gift economy]] with the value determined by [[calculation in kind]]. In criticizing collectivist anarchism's retaining of labour vouchers and cheques, [[Peter Kropotkin]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[F]or after having proclaimed the abolition of private property, and the possession in common of all means of production, how can they uphold the wages system in any form? It is, nevertheless, what collectivists are doing when they recommend labour-cheques.&lt;ref name="KropotkinBreadChapterXIII"&gt;Peter Kropotkin (1906). ''The Conquest of Bread''. New York and London: G. P. Putnam's Sons). [[s:The Conquest of Bread/Chapter XIII|Chapter XIII - The Collectivist Wages System]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[World Socialist Movement]] has argued against using labour vouchers as either a permanent or a temporary system while transitioning to their desired anarcho-communist economy based on free access. They claim that seeing as most of the occupations that currently exist under capitalism will no longer exist, [[scarcity]] would no longer be an issue. They also state:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Labour vouchers would tend to maintain the idea that our human worth is determined by how much or how many goods we can own (or produce). Labour vouchers imply that a very huge administrative organisation must police who takes the goods produced by society. In other words, there must be people who spend their time ensuring that other people do not take things without paying for them. That is normal in a profit-oriented society, but a waste of human labour in socialism.&lt;ref name="LabourVouchersWSM"&gt;[http://www.worldsocialism.org/articles/labour_vouchers.php "Labour Vouchers"]. World Socialist Movement. Retrieved 10 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Made in Britain''' is a [[not-for-profit organisation]] that supports British manufacturers under a single [[marque]]. The marque represents a standard of quality and unity for the British manufacturing sector within the UK and around the world.

The organisation works closely with the [[UK government]] and other groups to support skilled jobs and encourage creativity and [[sustainable growth]]. It campaigns all year round for British manufacturing.

== History ==
Made in Britain first began as the Made in Britain campaign in 2011. This campaign was established by [http://www.stoves.co.uk/ Stoves] – a [[Prescot]]-based cooker manufacturer.

Stoves commissioned independent market research using 1,000 adults&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2011/04/26/stoves-launches-campaign-made-britain-marque|title=Stoves launches campaign for 'Made in Britain' marque|work=The Drum|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; to discover the public’s opinion on British manufacturing – and whether it actually made a difference to people’s buying habits. From the study, 55% said that supporting UK manufacturing and jobs was their main incentive to buy British and 36% claimed to buy British whenever they can.

Following the research, Stoves launched a competition to design a logo for the newly established campaign. The winner was Cynthia Lee, a student designer from the [[University of Nottingham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/july-2011-online/news-analysis-the-made-in-britain-logo/|title=News analysis: The Made in Britain logo - Design Week|date=2011-07-19|work=Design Week|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 July 2011, the accreditation marque was unveiled and British businesses were invited to apply to use the logo for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2011/07/12/lsquomade-britainrsquo-marque-unveiled-following-national-campaign|title=‘Made in Britain’ marque unveiled following national campaign|work=The Drum|access-date=2017-09-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving support from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kandbnews.co.uk/newsandviews/industrynews/stovesmadeinbritaincampaignnowindependent#.WcURAdOGOV4|title=Kitchen &amp; Bathroom News   {{!}} Stoves' Made in Britain Campaign now independent|last=www.overthrowdigital.com|first=Overthrow Digital -|website=www.kandbnews.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with over 600 members on board, a new Made in Britain marque was commissioned in May 2013. The new design was finalised in June 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.the-partners.com/made-in-britain/|title=Made in Britain|website=The Partners|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Made in Britain was officially launched as an independent, non-profit organisation in December 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/news/article-2533876/Buying-British-Look-new-Made-Britain-logo.html|title=Buying British?

=== Board of members ===

Following the successful launch of Made in Britain as a not-for-profit organisation, a board of members was established. This is made up of volunteer members of Made in Britain, and leadership from other groups that support British design, trade and industry.

The current board members&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madeingb.org/marque/the-marque|title=The Marque - Made in Britain|website=Made in Britain|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; are: 
* Chairman &amp; Non-executive Director, Chris Harrop of [[Marshalls plc]]
* Non-executive Director, Camilla Hadcock of [http://www.roachbridgetissues.com/ Roach Bridge Tissues]
* Non-executive Director, David Osborne of [https://www.roman-showers.com/ ROMAN Showers]
* Non-executive Director, Uri Baruchin of [http://www.the-partners.com/ The Partners]
* Non-executive Director, Antony Wallis of [https://bestofbritannia.com/ Best Of Britannia]
* Non-executive Director, Peter Atmore of [http://www.fracino.com Fracino]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.madeingb.org/news/-peter-atmore-joins-made-in-britain-boa|title=Commercial Coffee Machines {{!}} Cappuccino &amp; Espresso {{!}} Fracino|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fracino.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2015, the campaign employed John Pearce as a full-time Chief Executive Officer. John joined the Made in Britain Campaign from the GREAT Britain Campaign, the government's overseas business, tourism and education initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-pearce-31222553/?ppe=1|title=John Pearce LinkedIn|last=|first=|date=|website=www.linkedin.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marque and branding ==

After it was commissioned by the board, the second iteration of the Made in Britain marque was created and designed by Kevin Lan and Miranda Bolter at The Partners. Inspired by a corner of the [[Union Jack]], the marque is designed to be instantly recognisable as the Made in Britain organisation.

When businesses join Made in Britain as a member they get access to the Made in Britain marque to use on their products, packaging and marketing material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Britain|first=Made in|title=Made in Britain Apply Here|date=2016-02-05|url=https://vimeo.com/154310113|accessdate=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flexible in size and scope, it’s used by a huge number of businesses in a number of industries. From large-scale industrial products and vehicles down to independently manufactured textiles, the marque is clear indicator of the diversity of British manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.dandad.org/awards/professional/2014/branding/23310/made-in-britain/ |title= Made in Britain {{!}} The Partners {{!}} Made in Britain {{!}} D&amp;AD Awards 2014 Pencil Winner {{!}} Branding Schemes/Small Business |website= www.dandad.org |language=en |access-date= 2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members often use the marque alongside their [[ISO9000]], BSI accreditations and the Queen’s Award for Export symbol.

== Types of manufacture ==
The biggest appeal of the Made in Britain organisation is that it celebrates the diverse nature of British manufacturing. To join the organisation and have use of the marque, businesses must become members of Made in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madeingb.org/members/apply|title=Apply for Membership - Made in Britain|website=Made in Britain|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When members join, they fall into a set category type:

* Building &amp; Construction
* Clothing &amp; Apparel
* Energy
* Engineering
* Environment
* Food &amp; Beverage
* Health &amp; Beauty
* Home &amp; Living
* Printing &amp; Publishing
* Sports &amp; Leisure
* Technology
* Transport

To prove their eligibility, companies must be transparent in their claims and display supporting information about their manufacturing process and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madeingb.org/marque/about|title=Made in Britain - Made in Britain|website=Made in Britain|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After joining, members are put into tiers depending on the financial turnover of the organisation – from T1 organisations (£1m per annum) to T4 organisations (&gt;£30m per annum). T4 organisations include [[Vauxhall]] that use the Made in Britain marque on its range of [[Renault Trafic|Vivaro]] vans. Rory Harvey, Vauxhall’s Chairman and Managing Director, said: &lt;blockquote&gt;“We are very proud of our 113-year heritage of building vehicles in Britain, and being part of this campaign is a great way to communicate this.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“The Made in Britain campaign does a brilliant job of reminding customers that we have a highly-skilled workforce on our doorstep, producing thousands of high quality products.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;T3 and T2 organisations include Roman Showers and Fracino – you’ll find the Made in Britain marque featured on a large number of products.

Velopresso is an example of a T1 organisation that has used the Made in Britain marque as a way to communicate its commitment to British manufacture. &lt;blockquote&gt;“For us, the Made in Britain marque testifies not only to the provenance of Velopresso, but also to the strong relationships we’ve built with all those involved in its design and manufacture.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Future plans ==
Made in Britain is working to help [[Crown Commercial Service]] to identify UK manufacturers that are keen to sell to local authorities and the UK government – either for the first time or to increase their sales.

'''Maximilian Egon II, Prince of Fürstenberg''' (1863 – 1941) was a German landowner and investor. He was a member of the [[House of Fürstenberg]] and a minor noble in several German-speaking states, including [[Austria]].

==Family==

Born as Maximilian Egon Christian Karl Aloys Emil Leo Richard Anton, [[Fürstenberg (princely family)|Prince of Fürstenberg]], he was the son of Maximilian Egon, Prince of Fürstenberg, and his wife Leontina, Countess of [[Khevenhüller]]-Metsch. He had a younger brother, born in 1867, named Karl Emil Egon, Prince of Fürstenberg.

By his marriage to Countess Irma von [[Schönborn-Buchheim]], he had three sons and two daughters:
* Karl Egon V zu Fürstenberg (1891–1973)
* Leontina zu Fürstenberg (1892–1979)
* Anna zu Fürstenberg (1894–1928)
* Maximilian Egon zu Fürstenberg (1896–1959)
* Friedrich Eduard zu Fürstenberg (1898–1916)

He also had an illegitimate daughter, Marie-Louise-Auguste von Almey, by a liaison with ''[[Freiin]]'' Marguerite von Almey.

==Life==
A close friend and adviser of Emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany]],&lt;ref name=conze/&gt; Max of Fürstenberg inherited territorial titles in [[Prussia]], [[Austria]], [[Hungary]], [[Württemberg]] and [[Baden]], and by virtue of them had a seat in the House of Lords in each of the five states. Until the [[World War I|First World War]], he was vice-president of the [[Prussian House of Lords]]. 

His principal residence was at [[Donaueschingen]], near the source of the [[Danube]], where he owned a castle and great deer forests. Emperor Wilhelm II frequently visited him there, and Max invariably accompanied the Emperor on his hunting expeditions and [[Norway|Norwegian]] trips. As well as his vast ancestral forests, he also owned coal mines, hotels and breweries.{{sfn|Rines|1920}}

Although he was a member of the high Roman Catholic ''[[Uradel]]'' who had long stood aloof from party politics, after meeting [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Ernst Roehm]] in November 1933, Max became enthusiastic about Hitler's leadership, commenting that "It was wonderful, to be able to meet such a great man".&lt;ref name=conze&gt;Eckart Conze, Monika Wienfort, eds., ''Adel und Moderne: Deutschland im europäischen Vergleich im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert'' , [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SzblA-uuDLEC&amp;pg=136#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 136]: "Es war herrlich, diesem einzig grossen Mann gegenueberstehen zu duerfen."&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, 1933, he joined the [[Nazi Party]] and the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]]. In 1938, he was appointed to the rank of ''[[Standartenführer]]''. He died in 1941, during the [[World War II|Second World War]], and was succeeded by his son, Karl Egon V (1891–1973).&lt;ref&gt;John Kennedy, John E. James, eds, ''Almanach de Gotha 2004'', Vol. 1, p. 508&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1958, Molten is the world's largest ball and sports equipment manufacturer. Molten USA, Inc. was established in 1983 to bring these quality sports balls to the [[United States|U.S.]] marketplace. Originally located in [[Southern California]], Molten USA moved to northern [[Nevada]] in 1988 and continues to call the [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]]–[[Sparks, Nevada|Sparks]] area its home.

Only six years after their founding, Molten basketballs, volleyballs, and soccer balls were the official balls of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. Molten has been the official basketball for the Olympic Games in Los Angeles (1984), Seoul (1988), Barcelona (1992), Atlanta (1996), Sydney (2000), Athens (2004), Beijing (2008) and London (2012). Molten basketballs have also been the official ball for the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) for the past 25 years{{When|date=February 2014}} culminating in the Men's and Women's World Basketball Championship. This championship was held in the U.S. for the first time in [[Indianapolis]] in August 2002.

Molten volleyballs became the official ball for the U.S. national teams in 1997 and the boys' and girls' junior national teams in 2001. Presently clubs, regions, high schools, colleges and tournaments throughout the U.S. use Molten volleyballs. At  2012 Molten has landed in the European football, and now supplying  the [[Alashkert FC|Alashkert]] in the [[Armenian Premier League]].

Molten supports several non-profit organizations and top leagues all over the world.

Monopolistc competition models are used under the rubric of [[imperfect competition]] in International Economics.  This model is a derivative of the [[monopolistic competition]] model that is part of basic economics.  Here it is tailored to international trade.

==Setting up the model==
Monopolies are not often found in practice, the more usual market format is [[oligopoly]]: several firms, each of whom is big enough that a change in their price will affect the price of the other firms, but none with an unchallenged monopoly.  When looking at oligopolies the problem of ''interdependence'' arises.  Interdependence means that the firms will, when setting their prices, consider the effect this price will have on the actions of both consumers and competitors.  For their part, the competitors will consider their expectations of the firm's response to any action they may take in return.  Thus, there is a complex game with each side "trying to second guess each others' strategies."&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, Paul, and Maurice Obstfeld.  ''International Economics: Theory and Policy,'' 7th ed. (Boston: Pearson Addison-Wesley, 2005) pg 116.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Monopolistic Competition model is used because its simplicity allows the examination of one type of oligopoly while avoiding the issue of interdependence.

==Benefits of the model==
The appeal of this model is not its closeness to the real world but its simplicity.  What this model accomplishes most is that it shows us the benefits to trade presented by [[economies of scale]].

==Assumptions of the model==
*1. Each firm is presumed to be able ''differentiate its product'' from that of its rivals.  Cars are a good example here; they are very different, yet in direct competition with each other.  This means there will be some customer loyalty, which allows for some flexibility for the firm to move to a higher price.  In other words, not all of a firm's customers would leave for other products if the firm raised its prices.
*2. This model dismisses the issue of interdependence when a firm sets its price.  The firm will act ''as if it were a monopoly'' regarding the price it sets, not considering the potential responses from its competitors.  The justification is that there are numerous firms in the market, so each receives only scant attention from the others.
===Background of the model===
:*An industry consisting of a number of firms, each of which produces differentiated products.  The firms are monopolists for their products, but depend somewhat of the number of reasonable alternatives available and the price of those alternatives.  Each firm within the industry thus faces a demand that is effected by the price and prevalence of reasonable alternatives.
:*Generally we expect a firm's sales to increase the stronger the total demand for the industry's product as a whole.  Conversely, we expect the firm to sell less if there are a significant number of firms in the industry and/or the higher the firm's price in relation to those competitors.  The demand equation for such a firm would be:

:::::::::::'''Q = ''S'' x [1/n - ''b'' x (P - ''P'')]'''

:::* "Q" = the firm's sales.  "''S''" is the total sales of the industry.  "n" is the number of firms in the industry, "''b''" is a constant term representing the responsiveness of a firm's sales to its price.  "P" is the price charged by the firm itself. "''P''" is the average price charged by its competitors.
:::* The intuition of this model is: 
::::* If all firms charge the same price their respective market share will be 1/n.  Firms charging more get less, firms charging less get more.
:::::*(Note) Assume that lower prices will not bring new consumers into the market.  In this model consumers can only be gained at the expense of other firms.  This simplifies things, allowing a focus on the competition among firms and also allows the assumption that if ''S'' represents the market size, and the firms are charging the same price, the market share of each firm will be ''S''/n.

==Early life and career==

Buzza was born in [[Perth, Australia]]. After completing schooling from [[Scotch College, Perth|Scotch College]], he joined [[Curtin University]] for Bachelor of Business degree program. Since childhood, he had a keen interest in entrepreneurship and to fulfill his dreams, he dropped out of University in between before completing his business degree. In 1992, Buzza along with his childhood friend Zane Lewis co-founded CommtechWireless to supply middleware clinical workflow software solutions to the healthcare companies.&lt;ref name="high"&gt;{{cite news|title=Buzza programmed to invent.|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-90384257.html|accessdate=15 October 2014|publisher=Highbeam|date=15 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company received R&amp;D start grant from the government to develop software solutions for mid-clinical healthcare companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Birrane|first1=Alison|title=Buzza's ingredients spice up breakfast|url=http://www.businessnews.com.au/article/Buzza-s-ingredients-spice-up-breakfast|accessdate=15 October 2014|date=28 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company saw an early success and expanded its locations in Denmark, Hong Kong, Sydney and Jacksonville with headquarter in Perth. By 2005, the company installed their middleware health solutions in 60 countries and was named as one of the fastest growing businesses by BRW Magazine and Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.

In 2008, Amcom Software acquired CommtechWireless,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Amcom Software, Inc.

'''Networks''' are crucial parts of any action taken in a [[marketplace]].&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Peter Drucker &lt;ref&gt;Drucker, P (1993) Post Capitalist Society. Oxford: Butterworth.&lt;/ref&gt; even described the future economy as one of a society of networks. Companies embedded in such networks stand to gain a lot.&lt;ref name="Achrol"&gt;Achrol, R. S., &amp; Kotler, P. (1999). Marketing in the Network Economy. The Journal of Marketing, 63, 146-163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wyner"&gt;Gordon, A. W. (1999). Network effects in marketing. Marketing Research, 11(3), 36.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of different network models, which have distinct relevance to customers,&lt;ref name="Wyner"/&gt; and marketing initiatives. A network in marketing can be formed either strategically (e.g. [[Business networking]]) or completely randomly (e.g. [[Referral economy]]). [[Marketing channel]]s and business networks have been referred to, by Achrol &amp; Kotler &lt;ref name="Achrol"/&gt; as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Interdependent systems of organizations and relations that are involved in carrying out all of the production and marketing activities involved in creating and delivering value in the form of products and services to intermediate and final customers.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Achrol &amp; Kotler &lt;ref name="Achrol"/&gt; stated that networks are not accepting of traditional mechanisms, such as authority and control. Suggesting that organizational hierarchy, power and contracts are now exchanged for instruments of relational control. Businesses such as Ford, Procter &amp; Gamble and General Electric have evolved in much the same. It wasn’t all to long ago that they were organized as classic hierarchies. Displaying central control, unified purpose, and complex management structure of many tiers.&lt;ref name="Achrol"/&gt;

Business and marketing networks differ in the amount of connectivity between agents. Some markets, which are more fragmented, have less connectivity between agents than others. On top of this, the level of [[complexity]] differs between various networks, some may seem ordered and rather linear, whereas other random and [[Chaos theory|chaotic]]. As a network develops, agents or entities form relationships with others, which increases the efficiency of operations. Although, this inevitably adds complexity to otherwise simple networks, and makes them more prone to chaos.

==Networks in general==
{{see also|network (disambiguation){{!}}network}}
A network is a web of interrelated lines, passages, or edges, intersecting at a certain points, nodes, vertices, or places, which can be interlinked with other networks and contain sub networks .&lt;ref&gt;search networking, http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/network&lt;/ref&gt; Networks have been linked to branches of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|mathematics]], electronics, [[Biological network|biology]], and [[Social network|biosocial fields]]. Studies of inter-organization relations, and its networks, can be traced to early societies.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;Wilkinson, I. (2001). A History of Network and Channels Thinking in Marketing in the 20th Century. Australasian Marketing Journal (AMJ), 9(2), 23-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1736, Leonhard Euler created [[graph theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Leonhard Euler's Solution to the Konigsberg Bridge Problem. {{cite web |url=http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/46/?pa=content&amp;sa=viewDocument&amp;nodeId=1310&amp;bodyId=1452 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522140452/http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/46/?pa=content&amp;sa=viewDocument&amp;nodeId=1310&amp;bodyId=1452 |archivedate=2011-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Graph theory paved the way for network models such as [[Barabási–Albert model|Barabási-Albert’s]] scale-free networks, chance networks such as Paul Erdös and Alfréd Rényi,  [[Erdős–Rényi model]], which applies to random graph theory, and Watts &amp; Strogatz [[Small-world network]], all of which can be adapted to be representative of strategies and or relationships in the marketplace.

With respect to marketing, much of the creation of theories around systems, structure, and the management of business networks, can arguably be attributed to early economists such as John Common, Ronald Coase, and Joseph Schumpter.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; John Commons, in 1934, took ideas from the fields of law, economics, and psychology, and focused on transactions as a rudimentary unit of analysis. Commons showed how united economic entities arise and grow to deal with inherent conflicts of interest among agents and how united organizations are in control of individual actions in that it both restricts and facilitates it.&lt;ref&gt;Commons, J. (1934) Institutional Economics. New York:MacMillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Schumpter, in 1939, focused on the processes underlying industrial organizations and how they have transformed. He showed how the battle for survival among various types of businesses and networks, vying to serve the needs of society, fashioned the change of the industrial sector.&lt;ref&gt;Schumpter, J (1939) Business Cycles. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Ronald Coase, in 1937, introduced the concept of transaction cost. His research signified the development of ideas about exchange and more specifically the cost of securing agreements as well as coordinating, controlling and implementing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2626876|title=The Nature of the Firm|first=R. H.|last=Coase|date=1 January 1937|publisher=|journal=Economica|volume=4|issue=16|pages=386–405|doi=10.2307/2626876}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three economists, Wilkinson stated,&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; have been especially influential in the development of theories surrounding networks in marketing.

There are a number of notable historic studies, pieces of literature marketing networks. Theodore Macklin, in 1921, published a book called ‘Efficient marketing for agriculture’. He emphasized the importance of maintaining relationships between farmers and local middlemen, and between various levels of middlemen in bringing about successful and efficient marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Macklin, T (1921) Efficient marketing for Agriculture. New York: Ferris&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkinson stated that his study can be seen as a precursor for research on marketing and economic evolution and the way the development of marketing organizations linked local markets to larger scale markets that enabling the steps of economic specialize.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Another key study in the field could be that by Ralph Breyer, in 1924. Breyer introduced the thought of marketing flows, depicting marketing frameworks in terms of the flow of electric current through wires, when connections are made. Distinguishing organization unit channels, enterprise channels, business type channels, and channel groups with respect to the number of business actors involved.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, R (1924) The marketing institution. New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940’s, there were signs that change was in order. Marketers by the names of [[Wroe Alderson]], and Reavis Cox wrote an article in 1948, proposing a number of ways that marketing theory could be built upon. Alderson’s research depicted a divide in the development of marketing thought and more specifically the structure and operations of channel networks and marketing institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1246823|title=Towards a Theory of Marketing|first1=Wroe|last1=Alderson|first2=Reavis|last2=Cox|date=1 January 1948|publisher=|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=13|issue=2|pages=137–152|via=|doi=10.2307/1246823}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sought to understand the nature of work and the functional requirements of a marketing system and the way that marketing organizations come about to carry out this work.

These previously mentioned studies and pieces of literature demonstrate the creation of various ideas and thought surrounding networks in marketing. As the years have passed these concepts have develop and evolved, as will be shown.

===1960s===

Studies around this time had a focus on the economic structure of [[Distribution (business)|distribution channels]], looking at it from more of a macro view.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; A significant study was that by Cox, Goodman, and Fichandler, which built upon previous research conducted by Stewart, Dewhurst and Field (1939) and examined the distribution in a high level economy.&lt;ref&gt;Cox, R., Fichandler, T. C., &amp; Goodman, C. S. (1965). Distribution in a high-level economy. Englewood Cliffs: N. J., Prentice-hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Bert McCammon, in 1963, enriched the field further. He drew from previous literature by Schumpter and Coase, bringing together research and ideas from a number of behavioural sciences exploring the processes of change occurring in channel systems.&lt;ref&gt;McCammon Jr., Bert C.1963. Alternative Explanations of Institutional Change and Channel Evolution. In Stephen A. Greyser ed. Toward Scientific Marketing. Chicago: American Marketing Association 477-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other developments made in the 1960s were a number of models of channel systems. These models were created to study the many interactions taking place and how they affected performance. Wilkinson cited Forrester’s (1961) models of industrial dynamics and Balderston and Hoggat (1962) models of market processes as fundamental frameworks for following logistic models developed by Bowersox (1972) and his colleagues.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;

===1970s===
Research around this time looked more at the behavioral dimensions of channels, somewhat the result of Wroe Alderson’s earlier writings. The first attempts were made to improve the typical conceptual models of inter-firm relations towards the tail end of the 1970s. Major developments were undertaken by researchers such as Robicheaux.&lt;ref&gt;Robicheaux, R. A. (1976). A General Model for Understanding Channel Member Behavior. ''Journal of Retailing'', 52(4), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Also the first marketing channels textbook was created Malled in 1976.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Research in this decade was very limited in that studies were considered unsuccessful if conflict and power were not present. Leading researchers to focus on the car industry and franchisor-franchisee relations were conflict and power are more likely.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;

===1980s===

As the 1980s dawned so too did another era of research into networks and its behavioral dimensions. A significant study by Phillips, in 1981, challenged the problem of various informants in [[Business relations|inter-firm relations]] research.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt; Phillips suggested that the perceptions of a relationship differed across various informants in an organization. Putting into question the validity of many studies carried out in the years prior. It also showed that inter-organization relations involve personal as well as business relations and interactions between many people in a company.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip, L. W. (1981). Assessing measurement error in key information reports: A methodological note on organizational analysis in marketing. JMR, Journal of Marketing Research (pre-1986), 18(000004), 395.&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers also started to explore additional facets of inter-organization relations, combining them with more extensive models of relationships (e.g. Anderson and Narus&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J. C., &amp; Narus, J. A. (1984). A Model of the Distributor's Perspective of Distributor-Manufacturer Working Relationships. The Journal of Marketing, 48(4), 62-74.&lt;/ref&gt;). As well as this work by Oliver Williamsons in 1975 on transaction cost and the nature and price of inter-firm governance, sparked interest again on economic theories.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;

===1990s===
Literature around the 1990s brought together a number of research traditions. This is when various theories such as relationship marketing in industrial and consumer market appeared. The connection between services marketing to the analysis of relations and networks emerged. There was also more of a focus on cooperation as opposed to competing relations, which caused in an eruption of interest in the region of relationships and networks. Furthermore, Researchers began directing more effort to network dimensions, as opposed to isolated dyadic relationship. Moreover, new technology has been used in the study of business networks, allowing for specific issues to be addressed.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;

The developments made in the last several decades, demonstrate the evolution of pre-existing concepts and models in relation to networks in marketing, first proposed in the 1950s and 60’s. Wilkinson stated that what is needed now is the application of modeling techniques to portray networks in marketing, in order to strengthen current theories with empirical evidence.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"/&gt;

===2000s to present===

Various studies have used a number of methods to study business networks.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite journal |doi=10.1509/jm.10.0406 |title=How Doppelgänger Brand Images Influence the Market Creation Process: Longitudinal Insights from the Rise of Botox Cosmetic |year=2012 |last1=Giesler |first1=Markus |journal=Journal of Markeing |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages=55–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such study conducted by Aino Halinen, &amp; Jan-Åke Törnroos, looked at how networks are constructed and how they function in the modern day world. Giving insight into use of case studies as a method of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;Halinen, A., &amp; Törnroos, J.-Å. (2005). Using case methods in the study of contemporary business networks. Journal of Business Research, 58(9), 1285-1297.&lt;/ref&gt; Another key study, conducted by Jun, Kim, Kim, &amp; Choi, modeled consumer referrals through use of a small world network. Demonstrating that Watts &amp; Strogatz’s [[Small world network]] model can be adapted to interpret the initial linear relationship between firms, and consumers, and its subsequent development exhibiting small world properties.&lt;ref name="Jun"&gt;Jun, T., Kim, J.-Y., Jun Kim, B., &amp; Choi, M. Y. (2006). Consumer referral in a small world network. Social Networks, 28(3), 232-246.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively a study by Lorenzo Bizzi &amp; Ann Langley (2012) considered the key choices, with regard to methodology, met by researchers, when looking at network dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Bizzi, L., &amp; Langley, A. (2012). Studying processes in and around networks. Industrial Marketing Management, 41(2), 224-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Work by Ravi Achrol &amp; Philip Kotler identified several marketing network models.&lt;ref name="Achrol"/&gt;

===Layered network===

The first model proposed was that of a layered network. A layered network is a business which comprises “an operational layer of cross-functional teams on the one hand and a knowledge creating layer of functional silos on the other hand, connected internally and externally through extensive data bank knowledge and transparent information flows”.&lt;ref name="Achrol"/&gt; An example of this has been implemented by sharp electronics.&lt;ref&gt;Nonaka, I. (2007). The knowledge-creating company. Harvard Business review, 85(7-8), 162-162. http://hbr.org/2007/07/the-knowledge-creating-company/ar/1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal marketing networks===
The second model proposed is that of internal marketing networks. An internal marketing network is a “firm organized into internal enterprise units that operate as semiautonomous profit centers buying from, selling to, or investing in other internal or external units as best serves their needs on market determined terms of trade but subject to firm policy”.&lt;ref name="Achrol"/&gt; AC-Rochester is a definitive example{{According to whom|date=May 2015}} of an internal marketing network. It is one of eight component manufacturing divisions of General Motors, structured as an internal market. It markets its products to Mitsubishi in Japan, Daewoo in Korea and Opel in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, C. C., Miles, R. E., &amp; Coleman, H. J. (1992). "Managing 21st century network organizations". ''Organizational Dynamics'', 20(3), 5-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Internal marketing networks have many similar properties to those of small worked networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mlmnetworkmarketing.org/training/|title=Network Marketing Basics Tips|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=2017-07-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vertical networks===

A vertical network comprises a groups of resource firms specializing in the various product, technologies, or services that constitute the inputs of particular industry, organized around a focal company that focusing on monitoring and managing the critical contingencies faced by the network participants in that market.&lt;ref name="Achrol"/&gt;

Vertical network in marketing often represent monopolies. These would include companies such as Transpower, Kiwi rail, and the like. These networks display preferential attachment, similar that of Barabasi-Albert Model.

==Small world networks==

[[Watts and Strogatz model|Watt’s and Strogatz’s]] used graph theory to create three models depicting varying amounts connectedness, these were named [[Small-world network|Small world network]]. A small world network Is a graph in which most nodes aren’t connected to one another but as connections are made other nodes can be reached through only a couple of intermediaries. In terms of marketing small world networks have been used to model this such as consumer referrals (e.g. Jun, Kim, Kim, &amp; Choi).&lt;ref name="Jun"/&gt;

If we are to think of this in terms of a business relationship, it is not hard to see where this model becomes applicable. Consider Jun, Kim, Kim, &amp; Choi’s example of consumer referrals. Each node represents a consumer, and the connections represent the relationship one consumer has with another. As more incentive is given for referring a product the probability of increasing connections increases. What starts as a regular network, quickly becomes random and [[Complexity|complex]]. This same thing could apply a network of firms, middlemen and consumers. With every step in the chain, value is added to the product, and the cost increases. This increases the incentive for middleman, and or consumer to form other connections to get better deals. As deals and relationships are forged the network becomes more and more complex and integrated, creating disorder.

==Hubs==

‘Hubs’ or ‘connectors’ are important aspects to analyze when examining any system or network and marketing is no exception to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2139/ssrn.1526490 |title=Integrating the Social Network to Diffusion Model and Evaluation of the Value of Hubs in the Adoption Process  Electronic Journal |year=2009 |last1=Goldenberg |first1=Jacob |last2=Lowengart |first2=Oded |last3=Shapira |first3=Daniel }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A hub in a network is a consequence of a [[Power Law]], whereby a small number of nodes or actors in a network have a disproportionately large number of links to other nodes in the network. A Power Law in a market system for instance could be explained in that there are many actors who have a very limited number of business contacts in their 'rolodex', but there are a small few, say 10% of those in the network, who have a huge number of network contacts in their 'rolodex' and can easily facilitate communication between two separated actors. The idea that in a network the majority of nodes will have a couple of links which can allow communication through many pathways, whereas hubs have a large number of links and ensure that a network has full contact and eases the complexity of this.&lt;ref&gt;Bornholdt, S., Schuster, H. G. 2005. Handbook of Graphs and Networks: From the Genome to the Internet, Weinheim.&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the first empirical observations of hubs or connectors in social sciences experimentation came about in Stanley Milgram’s Small world experiments, the first of which taking place in 1967. Of the 64 letters which made it through to the stated destination, 60% of those went through the same four people, and in a further experiment of a similar nature when 24 letters got through, 16 of those went through the same last person as a connection.&lt;ref&gt;Travers, J., Milgram, S (1969) An Experimental Study of the Small World Problem. Sociometry, 32, 425-443.&lt;/ref&gt;
Hubs are distinctive components of network systems and through understanding them a better understanding of network function and behavior can be attained.&lt;ref name="Barabasi"&gt;Barabasi, A. 2002. Linked: The New Science of Networks, United States, Perseus Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Barabási states that hubs dominate all networks through the large number of links they possess, that the links hubs provide in areas of high clustering and also between areas of high clustering demonstrate their connective qualities. The presence of hubs in a market can be an important aspect of new product adoption and [[Diffusion (business)|diffusion]] rates, by utilizing hubs when bringing a product to market producers can generate more ‘buzz’ and reach a greater target audience with improved efficiency through the use of hubs and their large number of connections across a network.&lt;ref name="Delre"&gt;Delre, S.A., Jager, W., Bijmolt, T.H.A. &amp; Janssen, M. 2010. Will it spread or not? The effects of social influence and network topology on innovation diffusion. Journal of Product Innovation Management, 27, 267-282.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of hubs acting as facilitators of diffusion, they can take many forms. One example of this is a celebrity endorsement in a marketing campaign for a product, the celebrity acts as the hub by using their fame and the perceived links that consumers have with their favorite celebrities to distribute information about the product which is given to them by the producer.&lt;ref name="Delre"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roll, M. 2011. Branding celebrities, brand endorsements, brand leadership. Available :( http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/branding_celebrities_brand_endorsements_brand_leadership.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;
The links involved with hubs exhibit small world properties of a number of short paths between actors which are clustered due to similarities. However, while the interconnectedness which hubs can bring into a network is a great strength it can also be their greatest weakness in that, if functioning correctly hubs keep everyone in touch through a system, but remove a hub and the clusters become segregated and communication and information flow become strained.&lt;ref&gt;Gladwell, M. 2000. The Tipping Point: How Little things Can Make A Big Difference. United States of America, Little Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strong vs. Weak ties and their relative importance==

The concepts of weak and strong ties in a marketing and social sciences context relates to the intensity of the [[Interpersonal ties|relationships]] between members of a network. The strength of a tie according to [[Mark Granovetter|Professor Mark Granovetter]] can be analyzed by looking at a combination of; the amount of time, the emotional intensity, the intimacy and mutual confiding, and the reciprocal services between those which the tie exists.
A strong tie relationship obviously exhibits high levels of the afore mentioned attributes and in a relationship between two parties which is a strong tie there is assumed to be mutual choice for both parties involvement in the relationship. Strong ties are often found in highly dense groups of nodes who share many similarities and connections within the groups. Thus removing one or two strong ties in a group does not affect the information distribution through a group due to the intense interlinking present.&lt;ref name="Granovetter, M. S. 1973"&gt;Granovetter, M. S. (1973). The Strength of Weak Ties. American Journal of Sociology, 78, 1360-1380.&lt;/ref&gt;   
Weak ties refer to the relationships that are present between individuals which are not actively sought out or maintained. Where strong ties require high levels of commitment and other factors a weak tie only needs a small amount of connection to function effectively and does not require mutual agreement to be present. Nor do they require similar interests across nodes in a network, on the contrary weak links occur due to different interests but are created through often minimal factors. They link groups or clusters together despite differences in the clusters and enable the flow of information or diffusion of ideas to take place across an entire network rather it remaining in one cluster. 
The idea that removing strong ties from a network will not have as big of an effect as removing a weak one. The concept of [[Bridge (interpersonal)|bridges]] is central to this idea. A bridge is a connection which acts as the only way for information to travel between two nodes in a network, there are no other connections available to get said information across. Due to the nature of bridges strong ties are not able to be bridges due to the interconnected nature of strong ties in a community and the presence of alternate connections to facilitate [[lateral diffusion]]. Conversely weak ties can be bridges because they are often the only links between groups or nodes, however it is important to note that not all weak links are bridges there may be other connections, but all bridges are weak ties, thus transmission probabilities rely heavily on them.&lt;ref name="Granovetter, M. S. 1973"/&gt; 
An example of how weak ties can be effective at reaching a larger audience than strong ties is shown by Rapoport and Horvath’s 1961 study of a high school in Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, A., Horvath, W. J. 1961. A Study of a Large Sociogram. Behavioral Science, 6, 279-291.&lt;/ref&gt; 857 students were asked to rank their eight top friends from 1(best friend) to 8(associate). The results of the survey showed that those rated one or two were a small minority of the students, where those who were seen as more associates canvassed a vast majority of the sample. In this example the strong links were those rated as best friends where the weak links who had the ability for far greater diffusion of information were those considered associates. 
Through utilizing weak links available in the market a firm operating in one system or niche perhaps would potentially be able expand or tap into different markets through utilizing a weak link and diversify. Marketers also need to be aware that just because their advertisements are targeted specifically at a segment where they believe it will go down well or be acceptable such an adult advertisement on a billboard in a ‘suitable location’ or a giveaway on a beer bottle, due to weak links it has potential to be able to affect those outside the [[target audience]] or group who would find it appropriate.

==Complexity==

[[Complexity]] in networks is tied to the notion of elements of the system or networks have relationships amongst themselves which from relationships they may have with other elements outside their group. A [[complex system]] is a system composed of interconnected parts that as a whole exhibit one or more properties which can be obvious when viewing the system as a whole, however when viewing the individual components of the system their potential to produce is not visible (or obvious).
A complex system is a highly structured system, which shows structure with a number of variations. It is very sensitive to initial conditions and small alterations to these can result in dramatically different outcomes as chaos theory suggests, there are a number of pathways and evolutions which the [[butterfly effect|'butterfly’s wings']] are able to affect.  A complex system is one that by design or function or both is difficult to understand and verify. There are multiple simultaneous interactions by actors and components which lead to an overall output of a system.&lt;ref&gt;Mathews, K. M., White, M. C. &amp; Long, R. G. (1999). Why Study the Complexity Sciences in the Social Sciences? Human Relations, 52, 439-462.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is important in a marketing environment to recognize that there are many levels of complex systems at play and that targeting individual parts of production, advertising or other aspects will not often result in proportional outputs. On this note it is also important to recognize the nesting potential in a market complex system, where a market is made up of different firms which are complex systems themselves, which in turn are made up of people who also exhibit complex system functionalities. The market must be viewed as a whole to understand the sum of the parts and analyze emergent behaviors. The many aspects of complex systems mean that they are unpredictable and involve aspects of chaos and non-linearity and this in turn leads to the rise in small-world phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Uzzi, B., Amaral, L. A. &amp; Reed-Tsochas, F. (2007). Small-world networks and management science research: a review. [[European Management Review]], 4, 77 - 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chaos Theory==

[[Chaos Theory]] studies the behavior of [[dynamical systems]] that are highly sensitive to initial conditions. Chaos Theory applied to [[marketing]] offers an alternative explanation for the complex, apparently disorderly patterns of behavior in marketing systems over time which are observed in phenomena such as sales, inventories, brand shares and prices.&lt;ref name="Hibbert"&gt;Hibbert, B., Wilkinson, I. F. (1994). Chaos Theory and the Dynamics of Marketing Systems. Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, 22(3), 218-233.&lt;/ref&gt; Marketing systems are identified as being [[nonlinear systems|nonlinear]] in nature because they fail to satisfy the [[superposition principle]] (outputs are not directly proportional to inputs). Even though the rules governing behavior in marketing systems are known, it is impossible to make accurate long-term predictions of system behavior due to the high sensitivity of initial conditions. This happens even though marketing systems are fully [[deterministic]]. Traditional explanations of marketing phenomena typically rely on assumed patterns of external shocks, random noise or inherently stochastic processes to account for the [[complexity|complex]] dynamics within marketing systems.&lt;ref name="Hibbert"/&gt;

Chaos Theory explains at least a component of disorderly market behavior in terms of deterministic feedback mechanisms reflected in the rules governing system members’ behavior and interactions. This feedback represents non-linearity and occurs in two forms: (1) the reinforcing growth effect of positive feedback; and (2) the damping effect of negative feedback.  Chaos theory also offers alternative explanations for the existence of various types of marketing institutions as 'disequilibrium mechanisms' designed to buffer or reduce the effects of complex dynamics.&lt;ref name="Hibbert"/&gt; These include inventory-holding intermediaries, financial intermediaries, insurance agencies, and ordering systems. Finally, Chaos Theory can explain and predict structural change and evolution in marketing systems.&lt;ref name="Hibbert"/&gt;

The application of chaos theory to marketing systems can lead to new ways of coping with or avoiding these chaotic patterns of behavior, to the extent the rules governing behavior are amenable to control by firms and/or policymakers.

===Marketing Models with Chaos Properties===
Chaos is present in several popular marketing models of product diffusion, market or brand share and market evolution.&lt;ref name="Lambkin"&gt;Lambkin, M., Day, G.S. (1989). Evolutionary Processes in Competitive Markets: Beyond the Product Life Cycle. Journal of Marketing, 53(3), 4-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The transition from order to chaos can be demonstrated in this simple nonlinear equation, representing market evolution, under plausible assumptions of interdependence of actions and/or variables:

&lt;math&gt;N_{t+1}=rN_t[(K-N_t)/K]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Lambkin"/&gt;

The rate of growth, &lt;math&gt;rN_t&lt;/math&gt;, will be exponential as entry far exceeds exit.&lt;ref name="Doherty"&gt;Doherty, N., Delener, N. (2001). Chaos Theory: Marketing &amp; Management Implications. Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice, 9(4), 66-75.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the number of firms in the industry (&lt;math&gt;N_t&lt;/math&gt;) approaches the capacity (&lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;) and growth slows. Growth becomes negative should overcrowding occur, which may be reflected by, for example, price competition and competitive promotional activities. Eventually this competition will drive profit below threshold levels. The value &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; determines the degree of non-linearity present in the model and is the critical determinant of the pattern of market evolution.&lt;ref name=Doherty/&gt; Stable equilibrium occurs at values of less than 2, periodic and bifurcation patterns begin at values of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; exceeding 2 and chaos occurs at values of &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; greater than 2.57.&lt;ref name="Hibbert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gleick"&gt;Gleick, J. 2008. Chaos: Making a New Science, New York, U.S.A., Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Francisco Román was born on October 4, 1869 in [[Alcala, Cagayan]] to Pelagia Velásquez, a [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] and José Román a [[Spanish people|Spanish national]]. Pelagia was the sister of Hilaria Velasquez, the mother of [[Jose Palma|José]] and [[Rafael Palma]]. Paco's father, José, was a licensee of the tobacco monopoly system then implemented in the province. The family moved to Manila where the elder Román established a factory. Francisco then studied at [[Ateneo Municipal]] and eventually pursued studies in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="filipiknow" /&gt;

Roman married Juliana Piqueras, whom he had two children, Juan and Carmen.&lt;ref name="kahimyang" /&gt;

== Philippine independence struggle ==
Francisco Román  assumed his father's business after the latter died and secretly donated to the [[Katipunan|revolutionary cause]]. Being the son of a Spanish national, he sided with the colonial government and was believed to have volunteered in the Spanish cavalry in order to not be suspected of aiding the revolutionary forces.&lt;ref name="filipiknow" /&gt; At the outbreak of the [[Philippine–American War]], Roman joined General [[Antonio Luna]]'s forces and rose to the ranks to become a colonel and Luna's aide-de-camp.

Román led what came to be known as the [[Second Battle of Caloocan]] where his forces were able to push the invading [[United States forces|American forces]] back to [[Recto Avenue|Azcárraga Street]] in [[Manila]].&lt;ref name="filipiknow" /&gt;

=== Assassination ===
While setting up his mountain headquarters in [[Bayambang, Pangasinan]], General Antonio Luna received a telegram on June 4, 1899 from [[Cabanatuan, Nueva Ecija]] summoning him to a conference with the [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Emilio Aguinaldo]]. Román, together with Captain Eduardo Rusca, Majors Manuel Bernal, José Bernal, and Simeon Villa, and 25 cavalrymen, joined Luna to Cabanatuan.&lt;ref name="kahimyang" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "paw" /&gt;

The next day, en route to Cabanatuan, a broken bridge posed to delay the entire party. Luna, accompanied by only Román and Rusca, decided to proceed immediately to the parish convent which was used as Aguinaldo's office&lt;ref name= "paw" /&gt; after moving the [[First Philippine Republic|government]]'s capital from [[Malolos]].

At around three in the afternoon, Luna, Román, and Rusca arrived at the convent of Cabanatuan, with Luna proceeding to meet Aguinaldo. Upon hearing gunshots Román proceeded to come to Luna's aid, but was assassinated himself by Aguinaldo's personal guards from [[Kawit, Cavite]].&lt;ref name= "paw" /&gt;

Román was buried together with Luna at the town cemetery with military honors. However, the whereabouts of his body was lost, as Luna's was later exhumed and transferred.&lt;ref name= "kahimyang" /&gt; Aguinaldo denied any knowledge in the assassination of Luna and Román, but acknowledged his failure to persecute the people behind their deaths.&lt;ref name = "xiao" /&gt;

A '''''{{lang|de|partenreederei}}''''' (Plural: '''''{{lang|de|Partenreedereien}}''''') is a type of [[partnership]] under [[Law of Germany|German]] and German-influenced [[maritime law]] for the joint ownership of a [[merchant vessel]]. Each [[Business partner|partner]], or ''{{lang|de|partenreeder}}'', functions as an [[equity partner]], sharing proportionately in the proceeds, as well as the corporate debt of the business—this liability is not limited.&lt;ref name=hsba&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Schinas|editor1-first=Orestis|editor2-last=Grau|editor2-first=Carsten|editor3-last=Johns|editor3-first=Max|title=HSBA Handbook on Ship Finance|date=2014|publisher=Springer|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-662-43409-3|page=73|chapter=The German KG System|author1-last=Johns|author1-first=Max|author2-last=Sturm|author2-first=Christoph}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of ownership is related to the [[Law of the Netherlands|Dutch]] ''{{lang|nl|[[partenrederij]]}}'' system that ultimately gave rise to [[joint-stock company|joint-stock companies]], and dates back to the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Czerwenka|first1=Beate|editor1-last=Basedow|editor1-first=Jürgen|editor2-last=Magnus|editor2-first=Ulrich|editor3-last=Wolfrum|editor3-first=Rudiger|title=The Hamburg Lectures on Maritime Affairs 2009 &amp; 2010|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Heidelberg|isbn=978-3-642-27418-3|page=57|chapter=The Proposal for a Reform of German Maritime Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a system of business organization, ''{{lang|de|partenreederei}}'' was very common in the Baltic Sea and in England in the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Becker|first1=Bert|title=Coastal Shipping in East Asia in the Late Nineteenth Century|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society Hong Kong Branch|date=2010|volume=50|page=252|issn=1991-7295|jstor=23891206|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==German law==
{{see also|Law of Germany}}
The persistence of ''{{lang|de|partenreederei}}'' is one of several aspects of German maritime law that, according to Pokrant and Gran, has led to it being widely regarded as outdated and difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pokrant|first1=Günther|last2=Gran|first2=Andreas|title=Transport- und Logistikrecht|trans-title=Transportation and Logistics Law|date=2016|publisher=RWS Verlag|location=Cologne|isbn=9783814557755|page=2|language=German|chapter=Höchstrichterliche Rechtsprechung zum Gütertransportrecht|trans-chapter=Highest Judicial Court on the Law of Transport of Goods|doi=10.15375/9783814557755-003|via=[[De Gruyter]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, changes to the German commercial code (''{{lang|de|[[handelsgesetzbuch]]}}'' or HGB), barred the creation of new ''{{lang|de|partenreedereien}}''. Those still existing at that time were not required to reorganize.&lt;ref name=hsba /&gt;

==Austrian law==
{{see also|Law of Austria}}
After the fall of [[Nazi Germany]], the Austrian legal system retained many influences from German law. One of these was the ability to form a ''{{lang|de|partenreederei}}''. On 1 January 2007, the Trade Law Amendment Act ({{lang-de|Handelsrechts-Änderungsgesetz}}) entered into force, preventing the formation of any more ''{{lang|de|partenreedereien}}'', but allowing those that existed previously to continue.

'''''Planet of the Apps''''' is an American [[Reality television#Documentary-style|reality television show]] broadcast on [[Apple Music]]. It is the first original television show produced by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]. On July 23, 2018, it was announced that Apple had canceled the series after one season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Clover |first1=Juli |title='Planet of the Apps' Star Gary Vaynerchuk Blames Show's Failure on Apple's Poor Marketing |url=https://www.macrumors.com/2018/07/23/planet-of-the-apps-gary-vaynerchuk/ |website=[[MacRumors]] |accessdate=July 24, 2018 |language=en |date=July 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episode style==
On each of the episode, [[software]] makers have 60 seconds to pitch their idea in front of the judges ([[Jessica Alba]], [[Gwyneth Paltrow]], [[will.i.am]] and [[Gary Vaynerchuk]]) on a slow-moving [[escalator]]—for a visual idea of an "[[elevator pitch]]".

[[File:Earle, Does Price Fixing Destroy Liberty, 1920, i.jpg|thumb|''[[wikisource:Does Price Fixing Destroy Liberty?|Does Price Fixing Destroy Liberty?]]'' (1920) by [[George Howard Earle, Jr.]]]]
'''Price fixing''' is an agreement between participants on the same side in a market to buy or sell a [[product (business)|product]], service, or commodity only at a fixed price, or maintain the market conditions such that the price is maintained at a given level by controlling [[supply and demand]].

The intent of price fixing may be to push the price of a product as high as possible, generally leading to [[profit (economics)|profits]] for all sellers but may also have the goal to fix, peg, discount, or stabilize prices. The defining characteristic of price fixing is any agreement regarding price, whether expressed or implied.

Price fixing requires a conspiracy between sellers or buyers. The purpose is to coordinate pricing for mutual benefit of the traders. For example, manufacturers and retailers may conspire to sell at a common "retail" price; set a common minimum sales price, where sellers agree not to discount the sales price below the agreed-to minimum price; buy the product from a supplier at a specified maximum price; adhere to a [[price book]] or [[list price]]; engage in cooperative price [[advertising]]; standardize [[credit (finance)|financial credit]] terms offered to purchasers; use uniform [[discounts and allowances|trade-in allowances]]; limit [[discounts and allowances|discounts]]; discontinue a free service or fix the price of one component of an overall service; adhere uniformly to previously-announced prices and terms of sale; establish uniform costs and [[markup (business)|markups]]; impose mandatory [[fee|surcharges]]; purposefully reduce output or sales in order to charge higher prices; or purposefully share or pool markets, territories, or customers.

Price fixing is [[competition law|permitted in some markets but not others]]; where allowed, it is often known as ''[[resale price maintenance]]'' or ''retail price maintenance''.

In [[neo-classical economics]], price fixing is inefficient. The anti-competitive agreement by producers to fix prices above the market price transfers some of the [[consumer surplus]] to those producers and also results in a [[deadweight loss]].

International price fixing by private entities can be prosecuted under the antitrust laws of many countries. Examples of prosecuted international cartels are those that controlled the prices and output of [[Lysine price-fixing conspiracy|lysine]], [[citric acid]], [[graphite electrodes]], and bulk [[Hoffmann-La Roche#Controversies|vitamins]].&lt;ref name="AAEA"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://purl.umn.edu/19499 | title=Extraterritoriality of the Sherman Act and Deterrence of Private International Cartels | publisher=[[American Agricultural Economics Association]] AGM 2005 | date=April 2004 | accessdate=September 30, 2014 | author=Connor, John M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
===United States===
In the United States, price fixing can be prosecuted as a criminal [[federal offense]] under Section 1 of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1- |title=US CODE: Title 15,1. Trusts, etc., in restraint of trade illegal; penalty |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal prosecutions must be handled by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], but the [[Federal Trade Commission]] also has jurisdiction for civil antitrust violations. Many [[state attorney general|state attorneys general]] also bring [[antitrust]] cases and have antitrust offices, such as [[Virginia]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[California]].

Private individuals or organizations may file lawsuits for triple damages for antitrust violations and, depending on the law, recover attorneys fees and costs expended on prosecution of a case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oag.state.ny.us/business/antitrust.html|title=www.ag.ny.gov - New York State  Attorney General|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naag.org/issues/issue-antitrust.php Art Publishers Association, Bulletin: Be Careful About Antitrust Law (Feb. 2000)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022074748/http://www.naag.org/issues/issue-antitrust.php |date=2004-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185403/http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under American law, exchanging prices among competitors can also violate the [[antitrust laws]]. That includes exchanging prices with the intent to fix prices or the exchange affecting the prices individual competitors set. Proof that competitors have shared prices can be used as part of the evidence of an illegal price fixing agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |title=Antitrust Law Developments (2002); Art Publishers Association, Bulletin: Be Careful About Antitrust Law (February 2000) |publisher= |accessdate=15 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185403/http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts generally advise that competitors avoid even the appearance of agreeing on price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |title=Art Publishers Association, Bulletin: Be Careful About Antitrust Law (February 2000) |publisher= |accessdate=15 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185403/http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1997, US courts have divided price fixing into two categories: vertical and horizontal maximum price fixing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Tsui, Tat Chee, Interstate Comparison – Use of Contribution Margin in Determination of Price Fixing (2011). Pace Int’l Law Review Online Companion, Vol. 1, April 2011. at http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1839223&lt;/ref&gt; Vertical price fixing includes a manufacturer's attempt to control the price of its product at retail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sauer|first=Raymond D.|title=VERTICAL PRICE FIXING|url=http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~sauerr/classes/309/vertpfix.htm|accessdate=9 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708042032/http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~sauerr/classes/309/vertpfix.htm|archivedate=8 July 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[State Oil Co. v. Khan]],&lt;ref&gt;State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[US Supreme Court]] held that vertical price fixing is no longer considered a ''per se'' violation of the Sherman Act, but horizontal price fixing is still considered a breach of the Sherman Act. Also in 2008, the defendants of ''United States v LG Display Co.'', ''United States v. Chunghwa Picture Tubes'', and ''United States v. Sharp Corporation'', heard in the Northern District of California, agreed to pay a total sum of $585 million to settle their prosecutions for conspiring to fix prices of liquid crystal display panels. That was the second largest amount awarded under the Sherman Act in history.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, it is an indictable criminal offense under Section 45 of the [[Competition Act]]. [[Bid rigging]] is considered a form of price fixing and is illegal in both the United States (s.1 Sherman Act) and Canada (s.47 Competition Act). In the United States, agreements to fix, raise, lower, stabilize, or otherwise set a price are illegal ''per se''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?friend=nytimes&amp;court=us&amp;vol=310&amp;invol=150|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not matter if the price agreed upon is reasonable or for a good or altruistic cause or the agreement is unspoken and tacit. In the United States, price-fixing also includes agreements to hold prices the same, discount prices (even if based on financial need or income), set credit terms, agree on a price schedule or scale, adopt a common formula to figure prices, ban price advertising, or agree to adhere to prices that are announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |title=The Antitrust Laws A Primer (1993); Art Publishers Association, Bulletin: Be Careful About Antitrust Law (February 2000). |publisher= |accessdate=15 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185403/http://apa.pmai.org/readall/antitrustlaw.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although price fixing usually means sellers agreeing on price, it can also include agreements among buyers to fix the price at which they will buy products.

===Australia===
Price fixing is illegal in Australia under the [[Competition and Consumer Act 2010]], with considerably similar prohibitions to the US and Canadian prohibitions. The Act is administered and enforced by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]]. Section 48 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) explicitly states, "A corporation shall not engage in the practise of resale price maintenance." A broader understanding of the statutory provision is in Section 96(3)of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth), which broadly defines what can be resale price maintenance.

===New Zealand===
New Zealand law prohibits price fixing, among most other anti-competitive behaviours under the [[Commerce Act 1986]]. The act covers practices similar to that of US and Canadian law, and it is enforced by the [[Commerce Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/MediaCentre/MediaReleases/2004/commissionwarnsgpsaboutpricefixing.aspx| title=Commerce Commission warns GPs about Price Fixing| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416054240/http://www.comcom.govt.nz/MediaCentre/MediaReleases/2004/commissionwarnsgpsaboutpricefixing.aspx| archivedate=2009-04-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1986/0005/latest/DLM87623.html|title=Commerce Act 1965 No 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
Under the [[EU commission's leniency programme]], [[whistleblowing]] firms that co-operate with the antitrust authority see their prospective penalties either wiped out or reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= David|last= Gow|coauthors= |title=Heineken and Grolsch fined for price-fixing |date= April 18, 2007|publisher= |url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2059542,00.html |work=[[The Guardian]] |pages= |accessdate=2007-08-01 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
British competition law prohibits almost any attempt to fix prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?topicId=1074014670 |title=Price fixing, cartels and monopolies |publisher=Business Link |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Net Book Agreement]] was a public agreement between UK booksellers from 1900 to 1991 to sell new books only at the recommended retail price to protect the revenues of smaller bookshops. The agreement collapsed in 1991, when the large book chain [[Dillons Booksellers|Dillons]] began discounting books, followed by rival [[Waterstones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://britishacademy.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.5871/bacad/9780197263266.001.0001/upso-9780197263266 | title=The Organisation of Knowledge in Victorian Britain | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Daunton, Martin | authorlink =Martin Daunton| year=2005 | page=275 | isbn=978-0197263266 | doi=10.5871/bacad/9780197263266.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CEEDD1E3FF934A35753C1A967958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Suzanne | last=Cassidy | title=THE MEDIA BUSINESS; British Book Shops in Price Skirmishes | date=1991-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, price-fixing is still legal in the magazine and newspaper distribution industry. Retailers who sell at below cover price are subject to withdrawal of supply. The [[Office of Fair Trading]] has given its approval to the ''status quo''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Exemptions==
When the agreement to control price is sanctioned by a multilateral [[treaty]] or is entered by sovereign nations as opposed to individual firms, the [[cartel]] may be protected from lawsuits and criminal [[antitrust]] prosecution. That is why [[OPEC]], the global [[petroleum]] cartel, has not been prosecuted or successfully sued under [[US antitrust law]].

International airline tickets have their prices fixed by agreement with the [[IATA]], a practice for which there is a specific exemption in [[antitrust law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/search?q=%22IATA%22+antitrust+%22price+fixing%22|title="IATA" antitrust "price fixing" - Google Search|author=|date=|website=www.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=May 2017}}

==Examples==

=== Compact discs ===
{{main article|CD price fixing}}

Between 1995 and 2000 music companies were found to have used illegal marketing agreements such as [[resale price maintenance|minimum advertised pricing]] to artificially inflate prices of [[compact disc]]s in order to end price wars by discounters such as [[Best Buy]] and [[Target Corporation|Target]] in the early 1990s. It is estimated customers were overcharged by nearly $500 million and up to $5 per album. A settlement in 2002 included the music publishers and distributors; [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]], [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]], [[Bertelsmann Music Group]], [[EMI|EMI Music]], [[Universal Music Group|Universal Music]] as well as retailers [[Musicland]], [[Trans World Entertainment]] and [[Tower Records (music retailer)|Tower Records]]. In restitution for price fixing they agreed to pay a $67.4 million fine distribute $75.7 million in CDs to public and non-profit groups.

=== Dynamic random access memory (DRAM) ===
{{main article|DRAM price fixing}}
In October 2005, the [[Korea]]n company [[Samsung]] pleaded guilty to conspiring with other companies, including [[Infineon]] and [[Hynix Semiconductor]], to fix the price of dynamic random access memory ([[DRAM]]) chips. Samsung was the third company to be charged in connection with the international cartel and was fined $300 million, the second largest antitrust penalty in US history.

In October 2004, four executives from Infineon, a German chip maker, received reduced sentences of 4 to 6 months in federal prison and $250,000 in fines after agreeing to aid the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] with their ongoing investigation of the conspiracy.

=== Capacitors ===
In March 2018, the [[European Commission]] fined eight firms, mostly Japanese companies, €254 million for operating an illegal price cartel for [[capacitors]]&lt;ref name=jpcapactiros&gt;{{cite news|last1=JiJi|title=EU fines Japanese firms over price-fixing cartel for capacitors|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/03/22/business/eu-fines-japanese-firms-price-fixing-cartel-capacitors|accessdate=22 March 2018|work=The Japan Times Online|publisher=The Japan Times|date=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The two largest players were [[Nippon Chemi-Con]] which was fined €98 million and [[Hitachi]] Chemical which was fined €18 million&lt;ref name=jpcapactiros /&gt;.

=== Perfume ===
In 2006, the [[Cabinet of France|government of France]] fined 13 [[perfume]] brands and three vendors for price collusion between 1997 and 2000. The brands include [[L'Oréal]] (4.1mil euro), ''Pacific Creation Perfumes'' (90,000 euro), [[Chanel]], [[LVMH]]'s [[Sephora]] (9.4mil euro) and [[Hutchison Whampoa]]'s ''Marionnaud'' (12.8mil euro).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8GBH2GO1.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214162749/http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8GBH2GO1.htm |date=February 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea–based [[LG Display]] would pay $400 million, the second-highest criminal fine that the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|US Justice Department antitrust division]] has ever imposed. Chunghwa would pay $65 million for conspiring with LG Display and other unnamed companies and Sharp would pay $120 million, according to the department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&amp;sid=aP1P0CBFZssE&amp;refer=asia | work=[[Bloomberg News]] | title=LCD Makers Will Plead Guilty in Price-Fixing Scheme (Update2) | date=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[EU]] fined LG Display €215 million for its part in the [[LCD]] price fixing scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-08/six-lcd-panel-makers-fined-649-million-by-european-union-for-price-fixing.html|title=LCD-Panel Makers Fined $649 Million by European Union for Price Fixing|author=Aoife White|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|date=8 December 2010|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other companies were fined for a combined total of €648.9 million, including [[Chimei Innolux Corporation|Chimei Innolux]], [[AU Optronics]], Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd., and [[HannStar Display Corporation|HannStar Display Corp.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=SPEECH/10/736&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en |title=EUROPA - PRESS RELEASES - Press release - Joaquín Almunia Vice President of the European Commission responsible for Competition Policy Press conference on LCD cartel, Visa and French chemists' association decisions Press conference Brussels, 8 December 2010 |publisher=Europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; LG Display said it is considering appealing the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/tech/2010/12/133_77753.html|title=2 LCD giants face contrasting fates|publisher=[[The Korea Times]]|date=9 December 2010|accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air cargo market ===
In late 2005/early 2006, [[Lufthansa]] and [[Virgin Atlantic]] came forward about their involvement in large price-fixing schemes for cargo and passenger surcharges in which 21 airlines were involved since 2000 (amongst which were [[British Airways]], [[Korean Air]], and [[Air France-KLM]]). [[U.S. Department of Justice]] fined the airlines a total of $1.7 billion, charged 19 executives with wrongdoing and four received prison terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caldwell |first=Alicia A. |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41926712/ns/travel-news/t/airlines-fined-price-fixing-scheme/#.TrXMyRwrxt0 |title=21 airlines fined in price-fixing scheme |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, the [[New Zealand Commerce Commission]] filed legal proceedings against 13 airlines in the [[New Zealand High Court]]. According to the Commission, the carriers "colluded to raise the price of [freight] by imposing fuel charges for more than seven years".&lt;ref name="Commerce Commission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/BusinessCompetition/Anti-competitivePractices/commercecommissionprocedureinaccor.aspx|title=Commerce Commission procedure in accordance with standard best practice|date=20 March 2009|work=Release no 113|publisher=[[New Zealand Commerce Commission|Commerce Commission]]|accessdate=23 June 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090906183007/http://www.comcom.govt.nz/BusinessCompetition/Anti-competitivePractices/commercecommissionprocedureinaccor.aspx|archivedate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 [[Air New Zealand]] was the final airline of the 13 to settle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/the-commission/media-centre/media-releases/detail/2013/air-new-zealand-final-airline-to-settle-with-commerce-commission-in-air-cargo-case|title=Air New Zealand final airline to settle with Commerce Commission in air cargo case|work=Media Release|publisher=Commerce Commission|date=13 June 2013|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission noted that it might involve up to 60 airlines.&lt;ref name="CC Dec 08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comcom.govt.nz/the-commission/media-centre/media-releases/2008/internationalaircargocarteltobepro|title=International air cargo cartel to be prosecuted|date=15 December 2008|work=Media Release|publisher=Commerce Commission|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Commission said overseas competition authorities were also investigating the [[air cargo]] market, including the US and Australia where fines had been imposed.&lt;ref name="Commerce Commission"/&gt;

==Criticism on legislation==
[[Economic liberals]] believe that price fixing is a voluntary and consensual activity between parties that should be free from government compulsion and government interference. At times price fixing ensures a stable market for both consumers and producers. Any short term benefit of increased price competition will force some producers out of the market and cause product shortages and prices for consumers to rise. In the end price-fixing legislation forces producers out of a market because it can't compete with the biggest discounter and the market winds up a monopoly anyway. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv12n2/reg12n2-debow.html |title=Regulation Magazine Vol. 12 No. 2 |publisher=Cato.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prince Abbas Hilmi bin [[Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim]] bin [[Abbas II of Egypt|Khedive Abbas Hilmi II Bey]]''' ({{Lang-ar|الأمير عباس حلمي بن الأمير محمد عبد المنعم بن الخديوي عباس حلمي باشا الثاني}}) (born 16 October 1941, [[Cairo]]) is an Egyptian and Imperial Ottoman prince and [[Financial adviser|financial manager]]. A member of the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty]] and the Imperial House of Osman, he is the only son of [[Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim]] and his [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] wife [[Fatma Neslişah|Princess Neslişah]], and grandson of [[Abbas II of Egypt|Khedive Abbas Hilmi II Bey]].

==Early life==
Born in Cairo in 1941, Prince Abbas Hilmi was named after his paternal grandfather [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas Hilmi II]], the last [[khedive]] of Egypt. Theirs was the most senior male branch descended from [[Isma'il Pasha]], and thus first in the line of succession to the Egyptian throne by virtue of the [[Imperial Firman of 27 May 1866|1866 rules of succession]]. However, those rules were suspended by the British upon their proclamation of a protectorate over Egypt in 1914. Abbas Hilmi II was deposed, and his son [[Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim|Muhammad Abdel Moneim]] lost his place as [[heir apparent]].&lt;ref name="Burke 35"&gt;[[#Mon80|Montgomery-Massingberd 1980]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=bnsUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Millfield p. 35]&lt;/ref&gt; The throne passed to Abbas Hilmi II's uncles [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] and [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]]. The [[Royal Edict of 13 April 1922]] specifically excluded Abbas Hilmi II from the succession, although it stated that "this exception shall not apply to his sons and their progeny."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rizk |first=Yunan Labib |authorlink=Younan Labib Rizk |date=10–16 February 2000 |title=The fallen dynasty |journal=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |series=A Diwan of contemporary life, 324 |issue=468 |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/468/chrncls.htm |accessdate=9 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720043015/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/468/chrncls.htm |archivedate=20 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim and his son Prince Abbas Hilmi remained eligible for the throne and retained a senior position in the [[order of precedence]] of the [[Kingdom of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Cabinet of the Grand Chamberlain of the Kingdom of Egypt |title=Protocole |year=1947 |publisher=National Printing House |location=Cairo |language=French |oclc=2482348 |page=22 |trans-chapter=Members of the Royal Family by their degree of proximity to His Majesty the King |chapter=[[:File:Protocole du Royaume d'Égypte, 1947 – Page 022.jpg|Membres de la Famille Royale dans l'ordre de leur parenté avec Sa Majesté le Roi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Abbas Hilmi's two great-grandfathers on his mother's side were [[Mehmed VI]], the last Ottoman sultan, and [[Abdülmecid II]], the last Ottoman caliph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ottomanfamily.com/family_tree.html |title=Ottoman Family Tree |publisher=Official website of the immediate living descendants of the Ottoman Dynasty |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420055333/http://www.ottomanfamily.com/family_tree.html |archivedate=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mon80|Montgomery-Massingberd 1980]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=bnsUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Neslisah p. 247]&lt;/ref&gt; Had the Ottoman monarchy not been abolished in 1922, Prince Abbas Hilmi would have received, in addition to his Egyptian princely title ({{Lang-ar|أمير|translit=Amir}}), the [[Ottoman titles|Ottoman title]] of ''sultanzade'', which was given to the sons of imperial princesses.&lt;ref name="Sultanzades"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ottomanfamily.com/index.php?page=3 |title=Sultanzades |publisher=Official website of the immediate living descendants of the Ottoman Dynasty |accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1952, the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers]] launched a revolution that led to the forced abdication of King [[Farouk of Egypt]] in favour of his infant son [[Fuad II of Egypt|Fuad II]]. Due to Fuad II's minority, Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim was chosen by the [[Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council|new military rulers]] to serve as regent, first as head of a temporary [[Regencies in Egypt|regency body]] and later as sole [[prince regent]]. However, he did not last long in the position, as the Egyptian monarchy was officially abolished on 18 June 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rizk |first=Yunan Labib |authorlink=Younan Labib Rizk |date=27 January – 2 February 2005 |title=Royal help |journal=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |series=A Diwan of contemporary life, 578 |issue=  727 |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/727/chrncls.htm |accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim and his wife Neslişah were arrested in 1957 and accused of taking part in an anti-[[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=28 December 1957 |title=Egypt Investigates 'Anti-Nasser Plot' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/12/28/archives/egypt-investigates-antinasser-plot.html |format=Fee required |quote=It said a relative of former King Farouk, Prince Abdel Moneim, and his socialite wife, Nazli Shaa, had been arrested in connection with the plot.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their souring relations with the new revolutionary regime forced them into exile. As a result, their son Prince Abbas Hilmi spent much of his life in England and France.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;

==Business activities==
{{Egyptian Royal Family}}
Educated at [[Millfield]] school in [[Street, Somerset]], Prince Abbas Hilmi pursued his higher studies at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Burke 35"/&gt; He worked for a [[Discount store|discount house]], a bank and an [[insurance broker]] before joining Grieveson Grant &amp; Co. in 1968.&lt;ref name="Bulletin"&gt;{{Cite journal |year=1971 |title=Nothing's really British any more |journal=[[The Bulletin]] |volume=93 |issue=4762–4774 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jecXAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Abbas}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained with Grieveson Grant &amp; Co., one of the [[City of London|City]]'s top stockbrokers, until 1981. In 1970, he made history by becoming the first foreign member of the [[London Stock Exchange]],&lt;ref name="EIMA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eima.org.eg/prince.asp |title=Prince Abbas Hilmi |publisher=Egyptian Investment Management Association |accessdate=9 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012162931/http://www.eima.org.eg/prince.asp |archivedate=12 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; his election having been rendered possible by a change of Rule 21, which had previously restricted membership to British citizens.&lt;ref name="Bulletin"/&gt; After leaving Grieveson Grant &amp; Co., Prince Abbas Hilmi became a general manager of Schroder Asseily &amp; Co. (1981–1983), and then Chairman of Hilmi and Associates (1983–1986), where he was mostly engaged in financial management activities and project finance assignments. After spending three years in London as Vice-President of [[Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.]] (1986–1989), he joined the Concord Group in 1989, only one year after its establishment.&lt;ref name="EIMA"/&gt; He was part of the three-member team that launched the Concord Group's Cairo office in 1994. Since then, Egypt has become the group's main focus area, with more than half of the assets it manages ($2.8&amp;nbsp;billion out of $3.4&amp;nbsp;billion) being invested in Egyptian [[Security (finance)|securities]]. Concord is currently among the largest [[Investment management|asset management]] firms in Egypt. One of the funds it manages, the Egypt Investment Company Ltd, has been repeatedly ranked by the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' as the top performing fund in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Salah-Ahmed |first=Amira |date=13 August 2008 |title=One on One: Concord Carves Niche in Egypt's Capital Market |journal=[[Daily News Egypt]] |url=http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=15717 |accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Abbas Hilmi still works for Concord, where he holds the position of Senior Managing Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.concordus.com/bios/ahilmi.html |title=Prince Abbas Hilmi |publisher=Concord International Investments Group |accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural activities==
Since his return to Egypt in 1994, Prince Abbas Hilmi has devoted considerable time to the conservation of his family's architectural legacy. He was instrumental in providing the funds necessary for the 2004–2008 renovation of his great-grandfather [[Tewfik Pasha]]'s mausoleum, where he has reserved a burial plot for himself.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; In 2006, he founded the Friends of Manial Palace Museum Association, which seeks to preserve the [[Manial Palace and Museum|palace]] of his granduncle [[Mohammed Ali Tewfik|Prince Muhammad Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=28 June – 4 July 2007 |title=A princely estate |journal=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |issue=851 |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/851/sc15.htm |accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and children==
In 1969, Prince Abbas Hilmi married Mediha Momtaz (born 1945). The religious ceremony was performed in [[Istanbul]] on 1 June, and the civil marriage took place at the [[Kensington]] [[Register Office]] in London on 20 June. Mediha is a maternal granddaughter of Ahmad Midhat Abbas Yeghen, a descendant of one of the sisters of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], the founder of the Egyptian royal family.&lt;ref name="Burke 35"/&gt; Prince Abbas Hilmi and his wife Mediha are thus genealogically related, as illustrated by the family tree below. The couple have a daughter, Sabiha Fatma (born 1974), and a son, Daoud Abdel Moneim (born 1979).&lt;ref name="Sultanzades"/&gt; As of 2005, Prince Abbas Hilmi's only sister Ikbal (born 1944) lived in Istanbul with their mother [[Fatma Neslişah|Neslişah]] (1921–2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.egy.com/historica/egyptianconsorts.shtml |title=Egypt's First Ladies |first=Samir |last=Raafat |date=March 2005 |publisher=Egy.com |accessdate=7 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922021026/http://egy.com/historica/egyptianconsorts.shtml |archivedate=22 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''railway interest''' was the [[House of Lords|Lords]] and [[Member of Parliament|MP]]s in the [[United Kingdom|British]] parliament who held directorships or senior administrative posts in railway companies in the 19th century. They could be relied upon to vote in the interest of the railways when legislation aimed at controlling the companies' actions was proposed, and to persuade their fellow members, most of whom will have been railway shareholders, to follow suit. While the monopoly position of railways in inland transport remained unchallenged, the influence of the railway interest in resisting rates' control and safety improvements was a continuing concern both to free-trade liberals and to the aristocracy/landed-gentry with a dependence on farming. The 'interest' was particularly strong as [[Division (vote)|divisions]] were often not [[Whip (politics)|whipped]] on party lines until the end of the century.

'Railway members' of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] were listed in some early editions of [[George Bradshaw|Bradshaw]]'s ''Almanack, directory and shareholder's guide''s from 1847, and both Lords and MPs who were railway directors were listed continuously there from 1858 to 1923. Geoffrey Alderman shows that from 1868 to 1879 the number of MPs holding railway directorships was between 106 and 132 (out of 640 seats) that is, roughly up to a fifth of the house. This fell somewhat in 1880-1891 to 78-108, fell again in the 1890s to 65-79 and later in first decade of the 1900s to 34-50, which effectively saw the end of the interest's influence during the Liberal administration of 1906-1910.&lt;ref&gt;Alderman, p.227, pp.229-250&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reinhard Goerdeler''' (26 May 1922 – 3 January 1996) was a [[Germany|German]] [[accountant]] who was instrumental in founding [[KPMG]], the leading international firm of accountants. Goerdeler was born in [[Königsberg]], [[East Prussia]] (today Kaliningrad) as the son of [[Carl Friedrich Goerdeler]], a leading [[anti-Nazi]] activist and mayor of the city of [[Leipzig]].

While his father was on trial at the [[Volksgerichtshof]] after the [[20 July plot]], Goerdeler and his family were imprisoned by the Nazis at the [[Dachau concentration camp]] and in late April 1945 [[Transport of concentration camp inmates to Tyrol|transferred to Tyrol]] together with about 140 other prominent inmates, where the [[SS]] left the prisoners behind. He was liberated by the [[Fifth United States Army|Fifth U.S. Army]] on May 5, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georg-elser-arbeitskreis.de/texts/niederdorf.htm georg-elser-arbeitskreis.de (German)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314090141/http://www.georg-elser-arbeitskreis.de/texts/niederdorf.htm |date=2008-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving full-time education, Goerdeler joined Deutsche Treuhand-Gesellschaft (DTG) and worked his way up to the position of [[Chairman]] in which role he sought to expand the firm into an international network which could service his largest clients. His efforts led him to found Klynveld Main Goerdeler in 1979 and KPMG in 1987.

He went on to become chairman of [[KPMG]]. Dr. Goerdeler was also the first President of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC), the global organization for the accountancy profession. In retirement he was a [[trustee]] of the [[Max-Reger-Institute]] until he died on 3 January 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.karlsruhe.de/Kultur/Max-Reger-Institut/en/kuratorium.php Max Reger Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education, and career==
Born in [[Tegucigalpa]], Honduras, Kafie received a [[Bachelor of Science|Bachillerato en Ciencias y Letras]] from the [[Instituto San Francisco]] in 1965, and then moved to [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]] to attend [[Georgetown University]].  He graduated from Georgetown with a [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="SKC"/&gt; Kafie worked for his parents' business until 1974, when he established New Mark Representaciones S. R. L., which "represented domestic and international companies" conducting business in Honduras.&lt;ref name="CKB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schucrykafie.com/en/business/|title=Schucry Kafie biography, Business|access-date=July 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 Kafie was named "Honorary Consul of the Hashemite Kingdom of [[Jordan]]" in Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://consuladodejordania.hn/about-the-honorary-consul/|title=About the Honorary Consul|access-date=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacthosa and Lufussa==
In 1988, Kafie founded Lacthosa, initially as a dairy company, and in 1994, he and his brothers founded Lufussa. In 2004, the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Central America (FEMAMCO) awarded Kafie the ''Orden FEMAMCO'' for promoting and strengthening Central American integration, as operator of Lacthosa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fecamco.com/?page_id=1777 Orden FECAMCO 2004].&lt;/ref&gt; Through these companies, the wealth and influence of the Kafie family substantially increased, to the point that a 2006 study by the [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]] named Kafie one of "the most powerful men in Honduras", citing Kafie's role with respect to Lufussa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/12/honduras-governed-by-vested-interests/|title=HONDURAS: Governed by Vested Interests|first=Thelma|last=Mejía|publisher=[[Inter Press Service]]|date=December 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Roux"/&gt; Kafie has also been noted by a number of studies to be influential in a variety of other product categories, particularly including the [[dairy]] and [[fruit juice]] products sold by Lacthosa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundoculturalhispano.com/spip.php?article5500|title=Las "10 Familias", O El Reparto De Las Riquezas En Honduras|publisher=Mundo Cultural Hispano|access-date=July 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Poderos"&gt;Centro de Documentación de Honduras, ''Honduras: poderes fácticos y sistema político'' (''Honduras: Powers and the Political System'') (2008), p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In 2006, Kafie, along with his brothers Luis and Eduardo, established the Fundación Chito y Nena Kafie (Chito and Nena Kafie Foundation), a family [[charitable organization]],&lt;ref&gt;https://fundacionchitoynenakafie.org/&lt;/ref&gt; named for their parents (using their familiar names).&lt;ref name="La Cajita Nena"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latribuna.hn/2017/06/01/la-cajita-nena-ayuda-al-hospital-san-felipe/|title="La Cajita Nena" en ayuda al Hospital San Felipe|publisher=''[[La Tribuna]]''|date=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charity has engaged in a variety of projects aimed at improving the lives of Hondurans. In June 2017, for example the Foundation entered into a collaboration with the [[San Felipe General Hospital]] called  "La Cajita de Nena" to donate natal care boxes providing supplies for mothers who give birth there.&lt;ref name="La Cajita Nena"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Kafie married Marlene Nasser, a sister of [[Fredy Nasser]] in 1982. They have four daughters Stephanie, Elena, Vivian, and Marianne, all four of whom work for Lacthosa.&lt;ref name="SKC"/&gt; Kafie's daughter Elena is Marketing and Sales Director for Lacthosa,&lt;ref name="Sula Joins"/&gt; and daughter Marianne is also a Lacthosa executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tiempo.hn/lacthosa-recibe-por-septimo-fundahrse/|title=LACTHOSA recibe por séptimo año consecutivo el sello FUNDAHRSE|first=Luis|last=Destephen|publisher=''[[El Tiempo (Honduras)|El Tiempo]]''|date=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Small Business School''' was a weekly, half-hour [[television]] program that began airing in 1994 first in the United States on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]-member stations and then throughout the world via the [[Voice of America]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallbusinessschool.com|title=May The History Become the Future|work=Small Business School website|accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show went on location all over the USA and around the world to visit with the founders of a [[small business]] which had created work for at least ten years and they were recognized by their community and industry for their valuable contributions in making the world a better place.

The program was titled ''"Small Business Today"'' until 1995. Then, it was then titled ''"Small Business 2000."''  The producers said, "''We never expected to be still producing in 2000, so we had to re-brand the show a third time."''   &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/oct2004/sb20041013_6499_sb014.htm|title=I Want My Small-Biz TV! |last=Klein|first=Karen E.|date=2004-10-13|publisher=[[BusinessWeek]]|accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the interviews, these owners talk about how they got their idea for a business, how they got started, and how they got over the hurdles.&lt;ref name="history2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallbusinessschool.com|title=Small Business School|work=Small Business School website|accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many even talk about their initial failures. These interviews provide insight and inspiration for all business owners.

Each episode has a transcript, case study guide, overview and homepage to provide a means for viewers to further study each episode.

The show was on the air most actively between 1994 and 2008.  It has been in re-runs on PBS and [[Public, educational, and government access|PEG]] stations around the country.  The case study guides were first prepared for the PBS Adult Learning Satellite Service where they were made available to all the colleges and universities throughout the USA. Nobody can pay to be on this show and nobody has ever paid to be on it. For over 50 seasons the show was sponsored by many large American companies and for one season by the U.S. [[Small Business Administration]].

In December 1994 the television show put up its first website.  The transcripts, case study guides and overview were all posted.  By 1999 this online school for business owners began [[streaming video]] of key episodes.  By 2006, each key point within most of the weekly episodes began streaming as a short-burst, user-selected videos between one and five minutes long.  There were over 1800 video clips on the site that addressed key issues that typical business owners face every day.

'''Tomislav "Tole" Karadžić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Томислав Толе Караџић}}; born 10 February 1939) is a [[Serbs of Montenegro|Montenegrin Serb]] businessman and football administrator. From 2008 to 2016, he served in his second stint as the president of the [[Football Association of Serbia]] (FSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tomislav Karadžić za RTS: Derbi sa publikom! |url=http://www.rts.rs/page/sport/sr/story/36/Fudbal/18162/Tomislav+Karad%C5%BEi%C4%87+za+RTS%3A+Derbi+sa+publikom!.html |publisher=[[Radio Television of Serbia]] |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=9 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
From 2005 until 2006 Karadžić was the president of Serbian and Montenegrin Football Association (FSSCG). Prior to that he was the president of the regional FA (Football Association of Vojvodina), the job he performed for 18 years.  On 25 September 2007, Karadžić became the president of [[FK Partizan|Partizan Belgrade]] where he came following the decades-long reign of [[Nenad Bjeković]], [[Žarko Zečević]], and [[Ivan Ćurković]] at the club.

Simultaneously, Karadžić kept a position at the Serbian FA where he was a deputy to the association's president [[Zvezdan Terzić]]. In March 2008, Terzić fled the country after getting indicted for embezzlement of player transfer funds and Karadžić took over his role as FA president. During summer 2008 new elections were held for the FSS presidency. Karadžić beat out Dragan Aca Bulić.

== Controversy and criticism==
===1961 prison stay===
During his time as a student in [[Belgrade]], Karadžić was reportedly convicted in 1961 of [[aggravated assault]] and sentenced to year and a half in [[prison]]. The victim is said to have lost an eye. However, under mysterious circumstances, Karadžić was released after only 6 months in the [[ZIKS|Spuž prison]].&lt;ref name="FR" &gt;The [[Telegraf (Serbia)|Telegraf]]:[http://www.telegraf.rs/sport/809447-zbog-cega-je-karadzic-bio-u-zatvoru-u-tuci-ostavio-momka-bez-oka ZBOG ČEGA JE KARADŽIĆ BIO U ZATVORU? U tuči ostavio momka bez oka? (serbian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The incident briefly came back into public focus during August 2013 while Karadžić publicly clashed with the [[Red Star Belgrade]] club vice-president [[Nebojša Čović]] over ongoing Serbian SuperLiga administrative issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraf.rs/sport/808529-toletov-rat-i-mir-kriminalci-se-kriju-iza-dzajinog-imena|title=TOLETOV RAT I MIR: Zvezdini grobari, kockari i svodnici su uništili klub!|last=|first=|date=20 August 2013|work=Telegraf.rs|location=Belgrade|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraf.rs/sport/808952-covic-postavio-20-pitanja-toletu-karadizicu|title=ČOVIĆ PITA TOLETA: Zašto su te terali jajima i kako si zaradio desetine miliona evra?|last=|first=|date=21 August 2013|work=Telegraf.rs|location=Belgrade|accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Irregularities in player sales and match-fixing ===
For many years, Karadžić has been heavily criticized by public due to various reasons and decisions, which had catastrophic consequences for the Serbian football. After numerous serious irregularities in player sales (mostly for young players), serious suspicions of [[match-fixing]], and an impending boycott of the Serbian top club [[Red Star Belgrade]] combined with sharp criticism of over half of the clubs in [[Serbian SuperLiga]], Karadžić announced his resignation in late 2013.&lt;ref name="FR 2" &gt;The [[Frankfurter Rundschau]]:[http://www.fr-online.de/sport/serbischer-verbandschef-karadzic-kuendigt-ruecktritt-an,1472784,24117726.html Serbischer Verbandschef Karadzic kündigt Rücktritt an (german)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FNP" &gt;The Frankfurter Neue Presse:[http://www.fnp.de/sport/fussball/Serbiens-Fussball-vor-Truemmerhaufen;art148,599878 Serbiens Fußball vor Trümmerhaufen (german)]&lt;/ref&gt;

When criticism became public, he was in [[Budva]] on holiday, so therefore he didn't comment it in details, but referred to his critics as criminals. His adversary [[Zvezdan Terzic]] — a football administrator who also drew strong criticism by Serbian public for of similar reasons — called for the convening of a special meeting of the Federation Parliament and the immediate withdrawal. However, Karadžić not resigned and since then is even more under criticism.&lt;ref&gt;ekapija.de:[http://www.ekapija.com/website/de/page/602909/Tomislav-Karad%C5%BEi%C4%87-bleibt-an-der-Spitze-des-Fu%C3%9Fballverbandes-Serbien Tomislav Karadžić bleibt an der Spitze des Fußballverbandes Serbien (german)]&lt;/ref&gt; Accusations against him for administrative abuse, [[monopoly]], and [[clientelism]] have been continued.

=== Chants against Karadžić ===
For a certain time, during the league matches, fans frequently start a chant against him which says "Tole, lopove!" (Tole, you are a thief!), and these are often supporters of both teams playing, even the fans of the biggest Serbian clubs and eternal rivals, [[Delije]] and [[Grobari]]. These chants have been sung even during the matches of the [[Serbia national football team|Serbian national team]].&lt;ref&gt;alo.rs:[http://www.alo.rs/sport/fudbal/sad-i-grobari-vicu-tole-lopove/52053 (Serbian) Sad i „grobari” viču: TOLE, LOPOVE!

'''Lauritz Vilhelm Pacht''' (23 November 1843, [[Copenhagen]] – 20 May 1912, [[Holte]]) was a Danish [[Genre art|genre]] painter, industrialist and philanthropist. 

==Biography==
His father was a cap maker. After his confirmation, he began to learn printing, but was later apprenticed to a marble chipper.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[http://denstoredanske.dk/Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Kunst_og_kultur/Billedkunst/Maler/Vilhelm_Pacht Brief biography] @ Den Store Danske.&lt;/ref&gt; While taking classes at the [[Copenhagen Technical College]], his drawings attracted the attention of [[G.F. Hetsch]], who advised him to take up [[porcelain painting]]. After completing his courses, he was given a position at the [[Royal Porcelain Factory]], which he held from 1862 to 1867.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; 

Beginning in 1861, he also attended classes at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]]; passing his final exam in 1866. He began to have showings at the [[Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition]] and, in 1869, was awarded the {{ill|Neuhausenske Prize|da|De Neuhausenske Præmier}}.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; 

For several years, he worked to perfect a method to improve the reproduction of drawings by printing press. In 1872, he received a patent for his processes and set up a workshop for what he called the "Heliotype" (a process similar to [[hectography]]). Later, he also produced [[phototype]]s.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; In 1880, he joined with the photographer, {{ill|Hilmar Crone|da}}, to create "Pacht &amp; Crones Illustrationsetablissement". Crone left the company in 1885 and was replaced by the drawing teacher, {{ill|Giovannino von Huth|da}}. That same year, Pacht started the "Skandinavisk Panoptikon", a combination [[wax museum]] and [[cabinet of curiosities]].&lt;ref name="V"&gt;[http://www.victorian-cinema.net/pacht Vilhelm Pacht] @ Victorian Cinema.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, he opened a factory that produced [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] ink and [[Oil paint#Paint tubes|paint tubes]]. In 1890, the company went public as an [[aktieselskab]]  called the "Danske Bogtrykkeres Farvefabrik", but he continued as General Manager.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; In 1896, he presented the first moving pictures in Denmark in a wooden structure called the "Panorama" at the square in front of Copenhagen's city hall. His building and equipment were lost to a suspicious fire, but he soon re-established his shows (renamed the "Kineoptikon") at his Panoptikon.&lt;ref name="V" /&gt;
 
His activities made him a wealthy man, but also ensured that his output as a painter was rather small.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=2674 Biographical notes] @ Kunstindeks Danmark.&lt;/ref&gt; Just before his death in 1912, he and his second wife, Oline, created the "Vilhelm Pachts Kunstnerboligs Legat" (Artist-Dwelling Legacy), which turned his mansion, "Pachts Bo", into housing for indigent artists.

A '''voluntary export restraint''' ('''VER''') or '''voluntary export restriction''' is a government-imposed limit on the quantity of some category of goods that can be exported to a specified country during a specified period of time. They are sometimes referred to as 'Export Visas'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OpqUoEMTB2wC|title=Export/Import Procedures and Documentation|last=JOHNSON|first=Thomas E.|last2=BADE|first2=Donna L.|date=2010-04-15|publisher=AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn|isbn=9780814415511|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically VERs arise when industries seek [[Protectionism|protection]] from competing imports from particular countries. VERs are then offered by the exporting country to appease the importing country and deter it from imposing explicit (and less flexible) [[trade barriers]].

==Characteristics==
VERs are typically implemented on exports from one specific country to another. VERs have been used since the 1930s at least, and have been applied to products ranging from [[textile]]s and [[footwear]] to [[steel]], [[machine tools]] and [[automobiles]]. They became a popular form of protection during the 1980s; they did not violate countries' agreements under the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in force. As a result of the Uruguay round of the GATT, completed in 1994, [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) members agreed not to implement any new VERs, and to phase out any existing ones over a four-year period, with exceptions grantable for one sector in each importing country.

Some examples of VERs occurred with automobile exports from [[Japan]] in the early 1980s and with textile exports in the 1950s and 1960s.

=={{anchor|1981VER}}1980 Automobile VER==

When the [[automobile industry in the United States]] was threatened by the popularity of cheaper more [[fuel efficient]] Japanese cars, a 1981 voluntary restraint agreement limited the Japanese to exporting 1.68 million cars to the U.S. annually as stipulated by U.S Government.&lt;ref&gt;Itō, Takatoshi. 1992. The Japanese Economy. MIT Press. 370&lt;/ref&gt; This quota was originally intended to expire after three years, in April 1984. However, with a growing deficit in trade with Japan, and under pressure from domestic manufacturers, the US government extended the quotas for an additional year.&lt;ref name=NYT84&gt;{{cite journal | title = About Cars; Chevrolet's Trio Challenge Imports | journal = The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/25/sports/about-cars-chevrolet-s-trio-challenge-imports.html | date = 1984-11-25 | last = Schuon | first = Marshall }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cap was raised to 1.85 million cars for this additional year, then to 2.3 million for 1985. The voluntary restraint was removed in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |quote=In May 1981, with the American auto industry mired in recession, Japanese car makers agreed to limit exports of passenger cars to the United States. This "voluntary export restraint" (VER) program, initially supported by the Reagan administration, allowed only 1.68 million Japanese cars into the U.S. each year. The cap was raised to 1.85 million cars in 1984, and to 2.30 million in 1985, before the program was terminated in 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Japanese automobile industry]] responded by establishing assembly plants or "transplants" in the United States (primarily in the Southern U.S. states where [[right-to-work law]]s exist as opposed to the Rust Belt states with established [[labor unions]]) to produce mass market vehicles. Some Japanese manufacturers who had their transplant assembly factories in the Rust Belt e.g. Mazda, Mitsubishi had to have a joint venture with a Big Three manufacturer (Chrysler/Mitsubishi which became [[Diamond Star Motors]], Ford/Mazda that evolved into [[AutoAlliance International]]). GM established [[NUMMI]] which was initially a joint venture with Toyota which later expanded to include a Canadian subsidiary ([[CAMI Automotive|CAMI]])) - a GM/Suzuki which were consolidated that evolved into the [[Geo (automobile)|Geo]] division in the U.S. (its Canadian counterparts Passport and Asuna were short lived - [[Isuzu]] automobiles manufactured during this era were sold as captive imports). The Japanese Big Three (Honda, Toyota, and Nissan) also began exporting bigger, more expensive cars (soon under their newly formed luxury brands like [[Acura]], [[Lexus]], and [[Infiniti]] - the luxury marques distanced themselves from its parent brand which was mass marketed) in order to make more money from a limited number of cars.
