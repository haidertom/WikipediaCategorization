'''''A.I. Artificial Intelligence''''', also known as '''''A.I.''''', is a 2001 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[drama film]] co-written, co-produced, and directed by [[Steven Spielberg]], co-written by [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]], and based on the 1969 short story "[[Supertoys Last All Summer Long]]" by [[Brian Aldiss]]. It was co-produced by [[Kathleen Kennedy (producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Bonnie Curtis]], and stars [[Haley Joel Osment]], [[Jude Law]], [[Frances O'Connor]], [[Brendan Gleeson]], and [[William Hurt]]. Set in a futuristic post-[[climate change]] society, ''A.I.'' tells the story of David (Osment), a childlike [[Android (robot)|android]] uniquely programmed with the ability to love.

Development of ''A.I.'' originally began with producer-director [[Stanley Kubrick]], after he acquired the rights to Aldiss' story in the early 1970s. Kubrick hired a series of writers until the mid-1990s, including Brian Aldiss, [[Bob Shaw]], Ian Watson, and [[Sara Maitland]]. The film languished in protracted [[development (film)|development]] for years, partly because Kubrick felt [[computer-generated imagery]] was not advanced enough to create the David character, whom he believed no child actor would convincingly portray. In 1995, Kubrick handed ''A.I.'' to Spielberg, but the film did not gain momentum until Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg remained close to Watson's [[film treatment]] for the screenplay.

''A.I. Artificial Intelligence'' divided critics, with the overall balance being positive, and grossed approximately $235 million. It was nominated for two [[Academy Awards]] at the [[74th Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] (by [[John Williams]]). In a 2016 [[BBC]] poll of 177 critics around the world, the film was voted the eighty-third greatest film since 2000.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st Century's 100 greatest films |work=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |accessdate=31 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131124228/http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |archivedate=January 31, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
In the late 22nd century, [[Sea level rise|rising sea levels]] from [[global warming]] have wiped out coastal cities such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Venice]], and [[New York City|New York]] and drastically reduced the world's population. A new type of robots called Mecha, advanced humanoids capable of thought and emotion, have been created.

David, a Mecha that resembles a human child and is programmed to display love for his owners, is given to Henry Swinton and his wife Monica, whose son Martin, after contracting a rare disease, has been placed in [[suspended animation]] and not expected to recover. Monica feels uneasy with David, but eventually warms to him and activates his [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] protocol, causing him to have an enduring childlike love for her. David is befriended by Teddy, a robotic teddy bear that belonged to Martin.

Martin is cured of his disease and brought home. As he recovers, he grows jealous of David. He tricks David into entering the parents's bedroom at night and cutting off a lock of Monica's hair. This upsets the parents, particularly Henry, who fears David intended to injure them.

At a pool party, one of Martin's friends pokes David with a knife, activating David's self-protection programming. David grabs Martin and they fall into the pool. Martin is saved from drowning, but Henry persuades Monica to return David to his creators for destruction. Instead, she abandons David and Teddy in the forest. She warns David to avoid all humans, and tells him to find other unregistered Mecha who can protect him.

David is captured for an anti-Mecha "Flesh Fair", where obsolete, unlicensed Mecha are destroyed before cheering crowds. David is placed on a platform with Gigolo Joe, a male prostitute Mecha who is on the run after being framed for murder. Before the pair can be destroyed with acid, the crowd, thinking David is a real boy, begins booing and throwing things at the show's emcee. In the chaos, David and Joe escape. They set out to find the [[The Fairy with Turquoise Hair|Blue Fairy]], whom David remembers from ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'', and who David believes can turn him into a real boy, allowing Monica to love him and take him home.

Joe and David make their way to the decadent [[resort town]] of Rouge City, where "Dr. Know", a [[Holography|holographic]] answer engine, directs them to the top of [[Rockefeller Center]] in the flooded ruins of [[Manhattan]]. There, David meets a copy of himself and destroys it. He then meets Professor Hobby, his creator, who tells David that he was built in the image of the professor's dead son David. David finds more copies of him, as well as female versions called Darlene, that have been made there.

Disheartened, David lets himself fall from a ledge of the building. He is rescued by Joe, flying an amphibicopter he has stolen from the police who were pursuing him. David tells Joe he saw the Blue Fairy underwater, and wants to go down to meet her. Joe is captured by the authorities, who snare him with an [[electromagnet]]. David and Teddy use the amphibicopter to dive down to see the Fairy, which turns out to be a statue at the now-sunken [[Coney Island]]. The two become trapped when the [[Wonder Wheel]] falls on their vehicle. David repeatedly asks the Fairy to turn him into a real boy. Eventually the ocean freezes and David's power source is depleted.

Two thousand years later, humans are extinct, and Manhattan is buried under glacial ice. The Mecha have evolved into an advanced silicon-based form called Specialists. They find David and Teddy, and discover they are original Mecha who knew living humans, making them special.

The Specialists revive David and Teddy. David walks to the frozen Fairy statue, which collapses when he touches it. The Mecha use David's memories to reconstruct the Swinton home. David asks the Specialists if they can make him human, but they cannot. However, he insists they recreate Monica from [[DNA]] from the lock of her hair, which Teddy has kept. The Mecha warn David that the clone can live for only a day, and that the process cannot be repeated. David spends the next day with Monica and Teddy. Before she drifts off to sleep, Monica tells David she has always loved him. Teddy climbs onto the bed and watches the two lie peacefully together.

==Production==

===Development===
Kubrick began development on an adaptation of "[[Super-Toys Last All Summer Long]]" in the late 1970s, hiring the story's author, Brian Aldiss, to write a [[film treatment]]. In 1985, Kubrick asked Steven Spielberg to direct the film, with Kubrick producing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Scott Brake |url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/200/200038p1.html |title=Spielberg Talks About the Genesis of ''A.I.'' |work=[[IGN]] |date=May 10, 2001 |accessdate=August 4, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N3Xvgw8?url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/200/200038p1.html |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warner Bros.]] agreed to co-finance ''A.I.'' and cover distribution duties.&lt;ref name=Ian/&gt; The film labored in [[development hell]], and Aldiss was fired by Kubrick over creative differences in 1989.&lt;ref name=connect&gt;{{Cite news |author=Steven Gaydos |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779484 |title=The Kubrick Connection |date=March 15, 2000 |work=Variety |accessdate=July 19, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N47xlcn?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779484 |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Shaw]] briefly served as writer, leaving after six weeks due to Kubrick's demanding work schedule, and [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] was hired as the new writer in March 1990. Aldiss later remarked, "Not only did the bastard fire me, he hired my enemy [Watson] instead." Kubrick handed Watson ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' for inspiration, calling ''A.I.'' "a [[picaresque]] robot version of ''[[Pinocchio]]''".&lt;ref name=Ian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Dana Haris |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779498 |title=Spielberg lines up ''A.I.'', ''Report'' |date=March 15, 2000 |work=Variety |accessdate=July 16, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N4NHRKf?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117779498 |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three weeks later, Watson gave Kubrick his first story treatment, and concluded his work on ''A.I.'' in May 1991 with another treatment of 90 pages. Gigolo Joe was originally conceived as a [[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] Mecha, but Watson suggested changing him to a male prostitute. Kubrick joked, "I guess we lost the [[toyetic|kiddie market]]."&lt;ref name=Ian/&gt; Meanwhile, Kubrick dropped ''A.I.'' to work on a film adaptation of ''[[Wartime Lies]]'', feeling [[computer animation]] was not advanced enough to create the David character. However, after the release of Spielberg's ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', with its innovative computer-generated imagery, it was announced in November 1993 that production of ''A.I.'' would begin in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Christian Moerk |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR115550 |title=''A.I.'' next for Kubrick at Warners |date=November 2, 1993 |work=Variety |accessdate=July 7, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65N6Bv8HO?url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR115550 |archivedate=February 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis Muren]] and Ned Gorman, who worked on ''Jurassic Park'', became [[visual effects supervisor]]s,&lt;ref name=connect/&gt; but Kubrick was displeased with their [[previsualization]], and with the expense of hiring [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]].&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

===Pre-production===
In early 1994, the film was in [[pre-production]] with [[Christopher "Fangorn" Baker]] as [[concept art]]ist, and [[Sara Maitland]] assisting on the story, which gave it "a feminist fairy-tale focus".&lt;ref name=Ian&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianwatson.info/kubrick.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703134444/http://www.ianwatson.info/kubrick.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-03 |title=Plumbing Stanley Kubrick |date= |accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maitland said that Kubrick never referred to the film as ''A.I.'', but as ''Pinocchio''.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818015944/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-08-18 |title=The Kubrick FAQ Part 2 |date=2008-08-18 |accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Cunningham]] became the new visual effects supervisor. Some of his unproduced work for ''A.I.'' can be seen on the DVD, ''[[The Work of Director Chris Cunningham]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Feature by Matt Bailey |url=http://www.notcoming.com/features/cunningham/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719222500/http://www.notcoming.com/features/cunningham/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-07-19 |title=notcoming.com &amp;#124; The Work of Director Chris Cunningham |date= |accessdate=2017-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from considering computer animation, Kubrick also had [[Joseph Mazzello]] do a [[screen test]] for the lead role.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; Cunningham helped assemble a series of "little robot-type humans" for the David character. "We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing," producer Jan Harlan reflected. "But it was a total failure, it looked awful." [[Hans Moravec]] was brought in as a technical consultant.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;
Meanwhile, Kubrick and Harlan thought ''A.I.'' would be closer to Steven Spielberg's sensibilities as director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117799373 |title=A.I.

The film's [[soundtrack]] was released by [[Warner Sunset Records]] in 2001. The original [[Film score|score]] was composed and conducted by [[John Williams]] and featured singers [[Lara Fabian]] on two songs and [[Josh Groban]] on one.

===Marketing===
Warner Bros. used an [[alternate reality game]] titled ''[[The Beast (game)|The Beast]]'' to promote the film. Over forty websites were created by Atomic Pictures in New York City (kept online at Cloudmakers.org) including the website for Cybertronics Corp. There were to be a series of video games for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] [[video game console]] that followed the storyline of ''The Beast'', but they went undeveloped. To avoid audiences mistaking ''A.I.'' for a [[family film]], no action figures were created, although [[Hasbro]] released a talking Teddy following the film's release in June 2001.&lt;ref name=find/&gt;

''A.I.'' had its [[premiere]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rooney|first=David|title='Dust' in the wind for Venice fest|url=http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=story&amp;id=1061&amp;articleid=VR1117797100&amp;cs=1|website=Variety|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=2017-04-01|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030032135/http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=festivals&amp;jump=story&amp;id=1061&amp;articleid=VR1117797100&amp;cs=1|archivedate=October 30, 2008|date=April 16, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home media===
''A.I. Artificial Intelligence'' was released on [[VHS]] and [[DVD]] by [[Warner Home Video]] on March 5, 2002 in both a standard full-screen release with no bonus features, and as a 2-Disc Special Edition featuring the film in its original 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen format as well as an eight-part documentary detailing the film's development, production, music and visual effects. The bonus features also included interviews with [[Haley Joel Osment]], [[Jude Law]], [[Frances O'Connor]], [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[John Williams]], two teaser trailers for the film's original theatrical release and an extensive photo gallery featuring production sills and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s original storyboards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slantmagazine.com/dvd/review/a-i-artificial-intelligence|title=A.I.

The film was released on [[Blu-ray Disc]] on April 5, 2011 by [[Paramount Home Media Distribution]] for the U.S. and by [[Warner Home Video]] for international markets.

===Critical response===
Based on 192 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 73% of critics gave the film positive notices with a score of 6.6/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A curious, not always seamless, amalgamation of Kubrick's chilly bleakness and Spielberg's warm-hearted optimism.

There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it's so long since I wrote it." Of the film's ending, he wondered how it might have been had Kubrick directed the film: "That is one of the 'ifs' of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick's wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it's a brilliant piece of film and of course it's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/artificial_intelligence/1542794.stm |title=ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE &amp;#124; The mind behind AI |work=BBC News |date=September 20, 2001 |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021220659/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2001/artificial_intelligence/1542794.stm |archivedate=October 21, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] heavily praised Spielberg's direction, as well as the cast and visual effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0,8599,130942,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626072644/http://www.time.com/time/sampler/article/0%2C8599%2C130942%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 26, 2008 |title=''A.I.''&amp;nbsp;– Spielberg's Strange Love&amp;nbsp;– ''TIME'' |date=June 17, 2001 |accessdate=April 1, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars, saying that it was "wonderful and maddening."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert |first=Roger |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/amp/ai-artificial-intelligence-2001 |title=A.I.

[[Mick LaSalle]] gave a largely negative review. "''A.I.'' exhibits all its creators' bad traits and none of the good. So we end up with the structureless, meandering, slow-motion endlessness of Kubrick combined with the fuzzy, cuddly mindlessness of Spielberg." Dubbing it Spielberg's "first boring movie", LaSalle also believed the robots at the end of the film were aliens, and compared Gigolo Joe to the "useless" [[Jar Jar Binks]], yet praised Robin Williams for his portrayal of a futuristic [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |authorlink=Mick LaSalle |last=LaSalle |first=Mick |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/06/29/DD239232.DTL |title=Artificial foolishness |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=June 29, 2001 |accessdate=August 6, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67p5z3LQ2?url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fc%2Fa%2F2001%2F06%2F29%2FDD239232.DTL |archivedate=May 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2013}} [[Peter Travers]] gave a mixed review, concluding "Spielberg cannot live up to Kubrick's darker side of the future."

In fact, as the long-awaited 'collaboration' of Kubrick and Spielberg, it ranks as something of a disappointment." Of the film's highly debated finale, he claimed, "There is no doubt that the concluding 30 minutes are all Spielberg; the outstanding question is where Kubrick's vision left off and Spielberg's began."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/a/ai.html |title=Review: A.I |publisher=Reelviews.net |date= |accessdate=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Screenwriter [[Ian Watson (author)|Ian Watson]] has speculated, "Worldwide, ''A.I.'' was very successful (and the 4th highest earner of the year) but it didn't do quite so well in America, because the film, so I'm told, was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes. Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the [[alberto Giacometti|Giacometti]]-style beings in the final 20 minutes were [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moonmilkreview.com/2010/author-talk-ian-watson-2/ |title=Author Talk: Ian Watson |publisher=Moon Milk Review |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=April 7, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67nCJehg6?url=http://www.moonmilkreview.com/2010/author-talk-ian-watson-2/ |archivedate=May 20, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Spielberg told film critic [[Joe Leydon]] that "People pretend to think they know Stanley Kubrick, and think they know me, when most of them don't know either of us". "And what's really funny about that is, all the parts of ''A.I.'' that people assume were Stanley's were mine. And all the parts of ''A.I.'' that people accuse me of sweetening and softening and sentimentalizing were all Stanley's. The teddy bear was Stanley's. The whole last 20 minutes of the movie was completely Stanley's. The whole first 35, 40 minutes of the film&amp;nbsp;– all the stuff in the house&amp;nbsp;– was word for word, from Stanley's screenplay. This was Stanley's vision." "Eighty percent of the critics got it all mixed up. But I could see why. Because, obviously, I've done a lot of movies where people have cried and have been sentimental. And I've been accused of sentimentalizing hard-core material. But in fact it was Stanley who did the sweetest parts of ''A.I.'', not me. I'm the guy who did the dark center of the movie, with the Flesh Fair and everything else. That's why he wanted me to make the movie in the first place. He said, 'This is much closer to your sensibilities than my own.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leydon |first=Joe |authorlink=Joe Leydon |url=http://www.movingpictureshow.com/dialogues/mpsSpielbergCruise.html |title='Minority Report' looks at the day after tomorrow&amp;nbsp;-- and is relevant to today &lt;!-- Apparently accidental typos in quoted refs should be "silently" repaired. --&gt; |work=Moving Picture Show |date=June 20, 2002 |accessdate=April 29, 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815010940/http://www.movingpictureshow.com/dialogues/mpsSpielbergCruise.html |archivedate=August 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[artificial intelligence]] and related fields, an '''argumentation framework''', or '''argumentation system''', is a way to deal with contentious information and draw conclusions from it.

In an abstract argumentation framework,&lt;ref&gt;See Dung (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; entry-level information is a set of abstract arguments that, for instance, represent data or a proposition. Conflicts between arguments are represented by a [[binary relation]] on the set of arguments. In concrete terms, you represent an argumentation framework with a [[directed graph]] such that the nodes are the arguments, and the arrows represent the attack relation.
There exist some extensions of the Dung's framework, like the logic-based argumentation frameworks&lt;ref&gt;See Besnard and Hunter (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; or the value-based argumentation frameworks.&lt;ref&gt;see Bench-Capon (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstract argumentation frameworks ==

=== Formal framework ===
Abstract argumentation frameworks, also called argumentation frameworks ''à la Dung'', are defined formally as a pair:
* A set of abstract elements called ''arguments'', denoted &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;
* A binary relation on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, called ''attack relation'', denoted &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Argumentation Framework.svg|thumb|left|upright=1|The graph built from the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.]]
For instance, the argumentation system &lt;math&gt;S = \langle A, R \rangle&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A = \{ a, b, c, d\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R = \{(a,b), (b,c), (d,c) \}&lt;/math&gt; contains four arguments (&lt;math&gt;a, b, c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;) and three attacks (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;).

Dung defines some notions :
* an argument &lt;math&gt;a \in A&lt;/math&gt; is acceptable with respect to &lt;math&gt;E \subseteq A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; defends &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, that is &lt;math&gt;\forall b \in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(b,a) \in R, \exists c \in E&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(c,b) \in R&lt;/math&gt;,
* a set of arguments &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is conflict-free if there is no attack between its arguments, formally : &lt;math&gt;\forall a, b \in E, (a,b) \not\in R&lt;/math&gt;,
* a set of arguments &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is admissible if and only if it is conflict-free and all its arguments are acceptable with respect to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Different semantics of acceptance ===

==== Extensions ====
To decide if an argument can be accepted or not, or if several arguments can be accepted together, Dung defines several semantics of acceptance that allow, given an argumentation system, to compute sets of arguments, called ''extensions''. For instance, given &lt;math&gt;S = \langle A, R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a complete extension of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; only if it is an admissible set and every acceptable argument with respect to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; belongs to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a preferred extension of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; only if it is a maximal element (with respect to the set-theoretical inclusion) among the admissible sets with respect to &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a stable extension of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; only if it is a conflict-free set that attacks every argument that does not belong in &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; (formally, &lt;math&gt;\forall a \in A \backslash E, \exists b \in E&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(b,a) \in R&lt;/math&gt;,
* &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the (unique) grounded extension of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; only if it is the smallest element (with respect to set inclusion) among the complete extensions of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.
There exists some inclusions between the sets of extensions built with these semantics :
* Every stable extension is preferred,
* Every preferred extension is complete,
* The grounded extension is complete,
* If the system is well-founded (there exists no infinite sequence &lt;math&gt;a_0,a_1,\dots,a_n,\dots&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\forall i&gt;0, (a_{i+1},a_{i}) \in R&lt;/math&gt;), all these semantics coincide—only one extension is grounded, stable, preferred, and complete.

Some other semantics have been defined.&lt;ref&gt;For instance,
* ''Ideal'' : see Dung, Mancarella and Toni (2006)
* ''Eager'' : see Caminada (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

One introduce the notation &lt;math&gt;Ext_\sigma(S)&lt;/math&gt; to note the set of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-extensions of the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!--SME: what does that last sentence mean to say?--&gt;

In the case of the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; in the figure above, &lt;math&gt;Ext_\sigma(S) = \{\{a,d\}\}&lt;/math&gt; for every Dung's semantic—the system is well-founded. That explains why the semantics coincide, and the accepted arguments are: &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Labellings ====
Labellings are a more expressive way than extensions to express the acceptance of the arguments. Concretely, a labelling is a mapping that associates every argument with a label ''in'' (the argument is accepted), ''out'' (the argument is rejected), or ''undec'' (the argument is undefined—not accepted or refused).
One can also note a labelling as a set of pairs &lt;math&gt;(\mathit{argument}, \mathit{label})&lt;/math&gt;.

Such a mapping does not make sense without additional constraint. The notion of reinstatement labelling guarantees the sense of the mapping. &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a reinstatement labelling on the system &lt;math&gt;S = \langle A, R \rangle&lt;/math&gt; if and only if :
* &lt;math&gt;\forall a \in A, L(a) = \mathit{in}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\forall b \in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(b,a) \in R, L(b) = \mathit{out}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall a \in A, L(a) = \mathit{out}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\exists b \in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(b,a) \in R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L(b) = \mathit{in}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\forall a \in A, L(a) = \mathit{undec}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;L(a) \neq \mathit{in}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L(a) \neq \mathit{out}&lt;/math&gt;

One can convert every extension into a reinstatement labelling: the arguments of the extension are ''in'', those attacked by an argument of the extension are ''out'', and the others are ''undec''. Conversely, one can build an extension from a reinstatement labelling just by keeping the arguments ''in''. Indeed, Caminada&lt;ref&gt;see Caminada (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; proved that the reinstatement labellings and the complete extensions can be mapped in a [[Bijection|bijective]] way. Moreover, the other Datung's semantics can be associated to some particular sets of reinstatement labellings.

Reinstatement labellings distinguish arguments not accepted because they are attacked by accepted arguments from undefined arguments—that is, those that are not defended cannot defend themselves. An argument is ''undec'' if it is attacked by at least another ''undec''. If it is attacked only  by arguments ''out'', it must be ''in'', and if it is attacked some argument ''in'', then it is ''out''.

The unique reinstatement labelling that corresponds to the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; above is &lt;math&gt;L = \{(a,\mathit{in}),(b,\mathit{out}),(c,\mathit{out}),(d,\mathit{in})\}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Inference from an argumentation system ===
In the general case when several extensions are computed for a given semantic &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, the agent that reasons from the system can use several mechanisms to infer information:&lt;ref&gt;see Touretzky et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Credulous inference'': the agent accepts an argument if it belongs to at least one of the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-extensions—in which case, the agent risks accepting some arguments that are not acceptable together (&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; each belongs to an extension)
* ''Skeptical inference'': the agent accepts an argument only if it belongs to every &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-extension. In this case, the agent risks deducing too little information (if the intersection of the extensions is empty or has a very small cardinal).

For these two methods to infer information, one can identify the set of accepted arguments, respectively &lt;math&gt;Cr_\sigma(S)&lt;/math&gt; the set of the arguments credulously accepted under the semantic &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Sc_\sigma(S)&lt;/math&gt; the set of arguments accepted skeptically under the semantic &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; (the &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; can be missed if there is no possible ambiguity about the semantic).

Of course, when there is only one extension (for instance, when the system is well-founded), this problem is very simple: the agent accepts arguments of the unique extension and rejects others.

The same reasoning can be done with labellings that correspond to the chosen semantic : an argument can be accepted if it is ''in'' for each labelling and refused if it is ''out'' for each labelling, the others being in an undecided state (the status of the arguments can remind the epistemic states of a belief in the AGM framework for dynamic of beliefs&lt;ref&gt;see Gärdenfors (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;).

=== Equivalence between argumentation frameworks ===
There exists several criteria of equivalence between argumentation frameworks. Most of those criteria concern the sets of extensions or the set of accepted arguments.
Formally, given a semantic &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; :
* &lt;math&gt;\mathit{EQ_1}&lt;/math&gt; : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they have the same set of &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-extensions, that is &lt;math&gt;S_1 \equiv_1 S_2 \Leftrightarrow Ext_\sigma(S_1) = Ext_\sigma(S_2)&lt;/math&gt; ;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathit{EQ_2}&lt;/math&gt; : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they accept skeptically the same arguments, that is &lt;math&gt;S_1 \equiv_2 S_2 \Leftrightarrow Sc_\sigma(S_1) = Sc_\sigma(S_2)&lt;/math&gt; ;
* &lt;math&gt;\mathit{EQ_2}&lt;/math&gt; : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they accept credulously the same arguments, that is &lt;math&gt;S_1 \equiv_3 S_2 \Leftrightarrow Cr_\sigma(S_1) = Cr_\sigma(S_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

The strong equivalence&lt;ref&gt;see Oikarinen and Woltran (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; says that two systems &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; are equivalent if and only if for all other system &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;, the union of &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent (for a given criterion) with the union of &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;the union of two systems represents here the system built from the union of the sets of arguments and the union of the attack relations&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other kinds ==
The abstract framework of Dung has been instantiated to several particular cases.

=== Logic-based argumentation frameworks ===
In the case of logic-based argumentation frameworks, an argument is not an abstract entity, but a pair, where the first part is a minimal consistent set of formulae enough to prove the formula for the second part of the argument.
Formally, an argument is a pair &lt;math&gt;(\Phi,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; such that
* &lt;math&gt;\Phi \nvdash \bot&lt;/math&gt; 
* &lt;math&gt;\Phi \vdash \alpha&lt;/math&gt; 
* &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is a minimal set of &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\Delta&lt;/math&gt; is a set of formulae used by the agent to reason.

One calls &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; a consequence of &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; a support of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

In this case, the attack relation is not given in an explicit way, as a subset of the Cartesian product &lt;math&gt;A \times A&lt;/math&gt;, but as a property that indicates if an argument attacks another. For instance,
* Relation ''defeater'' : &lt;math&gt;(\Psi,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;(\Phi,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\beta \vdash \neg (\phi_1 \wedge \dots \wedge \phi_n)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\} \subseteq \Phi&lt;/math&gt; 
* Relation ''undercut'' : &lt;math&gt;(\Psi,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;(\Phi,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\beta =\neg (\phi_1 \wedge \dots \wedge \phi_n)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\{\phi_1,\dots,\phi_n\} \subseteq \Phi&lt;/math&gt;
* Relation ''rebuttal'' : &lt;math&gt;(\Psi,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;(\Phi,\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\beta \Leftrightarrow \neg \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a tautology

Given a particular attack relation, one can build a graph and reason in a similar way to the abstract argumentation frameworks (use of semantics to build extension, skeptical or credulous inference), the difference is that the information inferred from a logic based argumentation framework is a set of formulae (the consequences of the accepted arguments).

=== Value-based argumentation frameworks ===
The value-based argumentation frameworks come from the idea that during an exchange of arguments, some can be ''stronger'' than others with respect to a certain value they advance, and so the success of an attack between arguments depends of the difference of these values.

Formally, a value-based argumentation framework is a tuple &lt;math&gt;VAF = \langle A, R, V, \textit{val}, \textit{valprefs} \rangle &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; similar to the standard framework (a set of arguments and a binary relation on this set), &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a non empty set of values, &lt;math&gt;\textit{val}&lt;/math&gt; is a mapping that associates each element from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to an element from &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\textit{valprefs}&lt;/math&gt; is a preference relation (transitive, irreflexive and asymmetric) on &lt;math&gt;V \times V&lt;/math&gt;.

In this framework, an argument &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; defeats another argument &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if
* &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; attacks &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in the "standard" meaning: &lt;math&gt;(a,b) \in R&lt;/math&gt; ;
* and &lt;math&gt;(\textit{val}(b),val(a)) \not\in \textit{valprefs}&lt;/math&gt;, that is the value advanced by &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is not preferred to the one advanced by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.
One remarks that an attack succeeds if both arguments are associated to the same value, or if there is no preference between their respective values.

=== Assumption-based argumentation frameworks ===
In assumption-based argumentation frameworks, arguments are defined as a set of rules and attacks are defined in terms of assumptions and contraries.

Formally, an assumption-based argumentation framework is a tuple &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{A}, \overline{\textvisiblespace} \rangle&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-387-98197-0_10|title=Argumentation in Artificial Intelligence|last=Dung|first=Phan Minh|last2=Kowalski|first2=Robert A.|last3=Toni|first3=Francesca|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9780387981963|editor-last=Simari|editor-first=Guillermo|pages=199–218|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-98197-0_10|editor-last2=Rahwan|editor-first2=Iyad}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bondarenko|first=A.|last2=Dung|first2=P.

*  &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{R} \rangle&lt;/math&gt;  is a deductive system, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the language and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of inference rules in the form of &lt;math&gt;s_0\leftarrow s_1, \dotsc, s_m&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;m &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_0, s_1, \dotsc, s_m \in \mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;;

As a consequence of defining an ABA, an argument can be represented in a [[Tree (data structure)|tree-form]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Formally, given a deductive system &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathcal{L}, \mathcal{R} \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and set of assumptions &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}\subseteq\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, an argument&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; for claim &lt;math display="inline"&gt;c\in{\mathcal{L}}&lt;/math&gt; supported by &lt;math&gt;S\subseteq\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt;, is a tree with nodes labelled by sentences in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; or by symbol &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, such that:
* The root is labelled by &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;
* For each node &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;,
** If &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is a [[leaf node]], then &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is labelled by either an assumption or by &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;
** If &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is not a leaf node, then there is an inference rule &lt;math&gt;l_N\leftarrow s_1, ... , s_m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(m \geq 0)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;l_N&lt;/math&gt;is the label of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; and
*** If &lt;math&gt;m = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then the rule shall be &lt;math&gt;l_N\leftarrow \tau&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. child of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;)

An argument&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with claim &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; supported by a set of assumption &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can also be denoted as &lt;math&gt;S\vdash c &lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Thomas Eakins, American - Portrait of Dr. Samuel D. Gross (The Gross Clinic) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|''The Gross Clinic'' (1875), 240 cm × 200 cm (8 ft × 6.5 ft), oil on canvas]]

The '''conservation-restoration of Thomas Eakins' ''The Gross Clinic''''' refers to the on-going [[conservation-restoration]] treatments of American painter [[Thomas Eakins]]' 1875 painting ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' throughout the 20th and 21st centuries. These treatments are a testament to the changing methodologies undertaken in the field of [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|paintings conservation]].

The painting portrays surgeon Dr. [[Samuel D. Gross]] performing a surgical debridement on a boy with [[osteomyelitis]] of the [[femur]] for an audience of students in his clinic at [[Jefferson Medical College]].

The painting was subject to several conservation-restoration treatments both prior to Eakins' death and in the decades following, which altered both the structural integrity of the painting as well as its surface composition. Emergency treatment was undertaken in 1960 and 1961 by Theodor Siegel, [[Paintings conservator|conservator]] at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]], to correct damage from previous restorations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegl|first=Theodor|date=Winter 1962|title=The Conservation of the "Gross Clinic"|url=|journal=Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin|volume= 57|pages=39–62|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent treatment was performed in 2010 by conservators at the Philadelphia Museum of Art to correct problems resulting from the 1961 restoration as well as the previous restorations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=An Eakins masterpiece restored : seeing The Gross Clinic anew|last=Foster|first=Kathleen A.|date=|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art in association with Yale University Press|others=Tucker, Mark S.|year=2012|isbn=9780300179798|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=|oclc=830662602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' portrays surgeon [[Samuel D. Gross|Dr. Samuel D. Gross]], the first chief of surgery at [[Jefferson Medical College]], performing surgery on a young man for [[osteomyelitis]] of the [[femur]] in the surgical amphitheater on the top floor of Jefferson's Ely Building in the company of multiple doctors and medical students. Chief of Clinic Dr. James M. Barton can be seen standing over the patient, probing the [[Surgical incision|incision]]. Junior assistant Dr. Charles S. Briggs, seen below Gross, is holding the patient's legs while Dr. Daniel M. Appel, seen bottom right, uses a retractor to hold open the incision. The anesthetist, Dr. W. Joseph Hearn, sits at the head of the operating table, holding a chloroform soaked rag over the patient's face. The clinic's clerk, Dr. Franklin West, records the surgery at a desk behind Gross. Gross' son Dr. Samuel W. Gross and orderly Hughey O'Donnell can be seen standing in the hall leading out of the amphitheater. A woman, possibly the patient's mother, can be seen recoiling at the bottom right. A self-portrait of [[Thomas Eakins|Eakins]] himself can be seen on the right side of the painting, in the front of the theater, taking notes.

Work on the painting likely began sometime in April 1875, as evidenced by a letter from Eakins to his friend [[Earl Shinn]] in which he declares, "What elates me more is that I have just got a new picture blocked in and it is very far better than anything I have ever done."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Work on the painting continued throughout summer of 1875, with Eakins holding multiple sessions with Dr. Gross at his home at 1729 Mount Vernon St. to produce studies for the final work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The work was likely finished by Christmas of 1875, evidenced by the gift of a portrait sketch of author and friend Robert C.V. Meyers, who modeled for the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Eakins submitted the painting for display at Memorial Hall during the 1876 [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]], but was rejected by Selecting Committee, who claimed there was inadequate space to display the painting. However, it was suggested by a correspondent of New York's ''Medical Record'' and by William Clark in the ''Philadelphia Evening Telegraph'' that the painting's graphic nature caused several members of the jury to feel faint.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=Jennifer|date=1999-10-01|title=Sex, Scandal, and Thomas Eakins's The Gross Clinic|url=http://rep.ucpress.edu/content/68/1|journal=Representations|language=en|volume=68|pages=1–33|doi=10.2307/2902953|issn=0734-6018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was instead displayed at the model ward of the U.S. Army Post Hospital, a replica created for the Centennial.

In February 1878 the painting was purchased by Alumni Association of Jefferson Medical College for $200.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Acquisition by The Philadelphia Museum of Art and Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts ===
On November 11, 2006 it was announced that the board of [[Thomas Jefferson University]] (formerly Jefferson Medical College) voted to sell the painting to the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. and to [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] heiress [[Alice Walton|Alice Walton's]] planned [[Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art]] in Bentonville, Arkansas for a record $68 million.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Due to the painting's connections to [[Philadelphia]], portraying Philadelphians painted in a Philadelphia college by a Philadelphia painter, the announcement of the impending sale caused an uproar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/11/arts/design/11pain.html|title=Eakins Masterwork Is to Be Sold to Museums|last=Vogel|first=Carol|date=2006-11-11|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anne d'Harnoncourt|Anne d’Harnoncourt]], director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, remarked that “It’s a painting that really belongs in Philadelphia — his presence still resonates here.”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Protests against the sale held in November and December 2006 were organized by Philadelphia artists Stanley Bielen, Charles Cushing, and Patrick Connors.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Philadelphia mayor [[John F. Street]] threatened to declare the painting a historic landmark, possibly tying up the sale in court.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The university gave local museums and government agencies the chance to match the $68 million sale price and keep the painting in Philadelphia by December 26, 2006.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/21/AR2006122101793.html|title=Philadelphia Blocks Sale of Eakins Painting by Matching $68 Million Bid|last=Trescott|first=Jacqueline|date=2006-12-22|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a joint effort by the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] and the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]], the funds were raised in 45 days through thousands of donations with the remaining amount loaned by [[Wachovia|Wachovia Bank]]. The remainder of the funding was completed in 2008 by the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art|Philadelphia Museum of Art's]] sale of ''Cowboy Singing'' and two oil sketches of ''Cowboys in the Badlands'' and the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] sale of ''The Cello Player,'' all works by Eakins.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/24/arts/design/24gros.html|title=Philadelphia Raises Enough Money to Retain ‘The Gross Clinic,’ an Eakins Masterpiece|last=Vogel|first=Carol|date=2008-04-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation-restoration treatments ==

=== 1915 ===
The first recorded conservation-restoration treatment to ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' took place sometime in 1915 by restorer T. H. Stevenson at the behest of [[Jefferson Medical College]]. The canvas on which ''[[The Gross Clinic]]'' was painted had become weak and brittle and was lined with a new piece of linen. A 1916 issue of ''The Jeffersonian'' noted that Stevenson cleaned and treated the painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1917-1925 ===
At some point between 1917 and 1925 a treatment of the painting took place that dramatically altered the composition of the painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is not known who worked on the painting or when. A comparison of a photograph of the painting taken in October 1917 for the ''Loan Exhibition of the Works of Thomas Eakins'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and a reproduction of the painting that appeared as the frontispiece of Jefferson Medical College's 1925 yearbook show major differences in the relative tones of the painting, indicating a major restoration in which paint was removed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The hall leading out of the amphitheater was considerably lighter; Dr. Samuel W. Gross and orderly Hughey O'Donnell originally appeared lighter than the background.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The majority of the painting now had a considerably redder tone.

Thomas Eakins' widow, [[Susan Macdowell Eakins]], upon seeing the 1925 reproduction and thinking the changes had been made for the reproduction rather than to the painting itself, strongly objected to its release. A letter from Eakins to Jefferson Medical College Dean Ross V. Patterson details her frustrations:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.philamuseum.org/conservation/14.html|title=Philadelphia Museum of Art - Research:Conservation: Thomas Eakins's The Gross Clinic|last=Philadelphia Museum of Art|first=|date=2010|website=www.philamuseum.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1940 ===
The next recorded treatment of the painting took place in 1940 was by Philadelphia restorer Hannah Mee Horner, at the behest of Jefferson Medical College. Hearing of the college's plans for restoring the painting, Eakins' student [[Charles Bregler]],who frequently treated multiple Eakins paintings at [[Susan Macdowell Eakins|Susan Eakins]] request, attempted to intervene but was rebuffed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Horner removed the linen lining attached by Stevenson in 1915 and replaced it with two, 4 by 6 1/2 foot pieces of [[plywood]] which were butted in the center and nailed to a wooden framework. The painting was then attached using carpenter's glue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Records also indicate that Horner also cleaned and restored the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1960-1961 ===
The results of the 1940 treatment proved to be disastrous and put the painting in serious need of new treatment. In the spring of 1960 conservator Theodor Siegl of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the first with professional training and credentials to treat the painting, cleaned and restored the painting at Jefferson's request. Varnish, applied by Horner, had become yellowed and darkened while a significant accumulations of grime also built up on the surface. Siegl used a combination of solvents to remove the grime and varnish, removed build up of filling putty used by previous restorers, and retouched areas that had been torn or distorted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Siegl finally applied a layer of varnish and made minor retouchings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1961 Jefferson again requested Siegl examine the painting prior to its inclusion in an Eakins retrospective that would travel from the [[National Gallery of Art]] to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and finally end in [[Philadelphia Museum of Art|Philadelphia]]. Siegl realized that the structure of the painting was in extreme danger from Horner's 1940 treatment. The plywood attached to the back of the painting had begun to warp, creating a crease in the middle of the painting which could have torn it in half. The nails in the plywood also began to move forward, creating bumps in the painting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Siegl's conservation-restoration of the painting moved forward in the summer of 1961. Due to the paintings large size, no table in the conservation department could accommodate the painting, thus a custom working platform with a built in thermostat was created.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To protect the painting in the course of removing the plywood the surface of the painting was covered with tissue paper and strips of [[muslin]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The framework was the first part of the 1940 treatment to be removed, revealing over 500 nails which had been causing a large portion of the damage to the painting's surface. A [[Plane (tool)|planer]], attached to an electric power saw, was used to remove most of the plywood, with the remainder being removed by hand.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The carpenter's glue used in the 1940 was then removed. A new linen lining was attached to the canvas, which was then attached to a new stretcher framework. A new, easily removable varnish was used on the painting's surface.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 2010 ===
[[File:Gross clinic bw.jpg|thumb|1875-1876 India ink and watercolor reproduction by Thomas Eakins.]]
Following the purchase of ''The Gross Clinic'' by the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in 2007 and after considerable research and discussion, the decision was made to conserve and restore the painting once more. The ultimate goal of the treatment was to both correct damage done by earlier treatments and restore the tones of the paint to reflect Eakins original intentions, which was made possible my extensive research on Eakins technique not available to earlier conservators.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This treatment was performed by [[Conservator-restorer|conservators]] Mark Tucker, Allen Kosanovich, and Terry Lignelli.

The first step concerned the removal of the varnish applied by Siegl in 1961, a [[synthetic resin]] called poly(n-butyl methacrylate), which was prone to discoloration and loss of [[solubility]], making it more difficult to remove as time went on. Taking place over the course of several weeks, the removal of this varnish allowed conservators to view what was left of Eakins original paint and what had been retouched by earlier treatments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A new, [[Synthetic resin|synthetic resin varnish]], MS2A, was applied to the surface which both evenly saturated the colors of the painting while isolating the original paint from the retouching, should it need to be removed in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 1875-1876 [[india ink]] and [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] reproduction created by Eakins, the 1917 photograph, and 1925 reproduction were used as a guide for conservators to retouch the painting. The conservators used paints made of lightfast pigments ground in a colorless synthetic resin to retouch the painting.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Smaller areas where paint had been flaked away were the first priority, followed by areas where large swaths of colors and tones had been altered. The area of the amphitheater's opening, in which a dark glaze had been removed, was restored to more closely resemble the small amounts of dark paint that remained as well as the 1917 photograph. Details of the many characters in the painting had been obscured due to earlier aggressive cleanings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The faces of orderly Hughey O'Donnell, Dr. Gross' son Dr. Samuel W. Gross, and Eakins were all restored to their original detail seen in the 1917 photograph.

Following the completion of the treatment an exhibition, ''An Eakins Masterpiece Restored: Seeing The Gross Clinic Anew'', was held between July 23, 2010 and January 9, 2011 at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128721065|title=Eakins' Classic 'Gross Clinic' Gets Another Look|last=Rose|first=Joel|date=July 25, 2010|work=NPR.org|access-date=2018-03-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/arts/design/19eakins.html|title=A Restored ‘Gross Clinic’ at Philadelphia Museum|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=2010-07-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discoveries ==
The use of [[Radiography of cultural objects|x-radiography]] and [[infrared reflectography]] prior to the 2010 treatment revealed a wealth of information about Eakins' technique and the creation of ''The Gross Clinic''.

=== Eakins' Technique ===
An x-radiograph of the painting revealed a heavy build-up of paint behind the heads of the principal characters. Rather than building upon dark areas with light paint, as was the convention at the time of the paintings creation, the x-radiograph revealed that Eakins instead built on light areas with dark paint.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The characters featured in the periphery of the painting were not significantly built up in this fashion and were instead painted thinly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Thomas Eakins|last=Sewell|first=Darrel|date=|publisher=Philadelphia Museum of Art|others=Foster, Kathleen A.|year=2001|isbn=9780300091113|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=353–365|oclc=47785680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composition of ''The Gross Clinic'' ===
[[File:Composition study for the portrait of professor gross thomas eakins.jpeg|left|thumb|Sketch for ''The Gross Clinic'']]
Significant changes in the composition of the painting before the final image were revealed using [[Radiography of cultural objects|x-radiography]]. The probe in the hands of Dr. James Barton was initially longer but shortened in the final composition. The clinic's clerk, Dr. Franklin West, was initially seen taking his notes at a lower position but was moved up for the final composition. Dr. Daniel M. Appel, seen bottom right, is shown in the sketch looking more to the right but in the final composition looking more to the left, showing more of his profile. In the final composition his arm was also moved slightly down, showing the patient's buttocks. X-radiography also revealed an initial stripe across the bottom of the painting, likely intended to serve as the wall circling the seats of the amphitheater, which was replaced with a view under the surgeon's table in the final composition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== An Eakins Masterpiece Restored: Seeing ''The Gross Clinic'' Anew ==
Following the completion of the 2010 conservation treatment, the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] opened the exhibition "An Eakins Masterpiece Restored: Seeing ''The Gross Clinic'' Anew", which ran from July 3, 2010 to January 9, 2011. The theme of the exhibition was "Then and Now", an homage to the famed and nearly two hour long lecture by [[Samuel D. Gross|Dr. Samuel D. Gross]], ''Then and Now: Advances in Medical Science in the Past Forty Years: a Discourse Introductory to the Forty-third Course of Lectures in the Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Autobiography of Samuel D.

'''Contamination''' is the presence of an unwanted constituent, contaminant or [[impurity]] in a material, [[physical body]], [[natural environment]], [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], etc.
Contaminants are biological, chemical, physical or radiological substance.

==Sciences==
"Contamination" has also more specific meanings in science:
*In [[chemistry]], the term usually describes a single constituent, but in specialized fields the term can also mean chemical mixtures, even up to the level of cellular materials. All chemicals contain some level of [[impurity]]. Contamination may be recognized or not and may become an issue if the impure chemical is mixed with other chemicals or mixtures and causes additional [[chemical reaction]]s. The additional chemical reactions can sometimes be beneficial, in which case the label ‘contaminant’ is replaced with [[reactant]] or [[catalyst]]. If the additional reactions are detrimental, other terms are often applied such as [[toxin]], [[poison]] or [[pollutant]], depending on the type of [[molecule]] involved. A major fraction of chemistry is involved with identifying, isolating, and studying contaminants.
*In [[environmental chemistry]] the term is in some cases virtually equivalent to [[pollution]], where the main interest is the harm done on a large scale to humans or to organisms or environments that are important to humans.
*In [[radiation protection]] the [[radioactive contamination]] is radioactive substances on surfaces, or within solids, liquids or gases (including the human body), where their presence is unintended or undesirable, or the process giving rise to their presence in such places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=IAEA Safety Glossary: Terminology Used in Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection |last1=International Atomic Energy Agency |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |isbn=92-0-100707-8 |pages= |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1290_web.pdf |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Programmes and Systems for Source and Environmental Radiation Monitoring.

: Also used less formally to refer to a quantity, namely the amount of [[radioactive decay#Radioactive decay rates|radioactivity]] in a location or on a surface, or on a unit area of a surface, such as a square meter or centimeter. 
:Contamination may include residual [[radioactive material]] remaining at a site after the completion of [[nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]] of a site where there was a [[nuclear reactor]], such as a [[power plant]], [[experimental reactor]], [[isotope reactor]] or a [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear powered ship]] or [[nuclear submarine|submarine]].
:The term [[radioactive contamination]] may have a connotation that is not intended. The term refers only to the presence of [[radioactivity]], and gives no indication of the magnitude of the hazard involved.
*In [[organic agriculture]] contamination with [[genetically modified organisms]] (GMOs) has been a cause for decertification of a farm.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2014) [http://orgprints.org/26549/7/26549.pdf  Organic versus GMO farming: Contamination, what contamination?].

International Sustainable Development Research Society (ISDRS) Newsletter, Issue 3: 8&lt;/ref&gt;

'''See also''' [[Environmental monitoring]], [[Radiation monitoring]]

*In [[food chemistry]] and [[medicinal chemistry]], the term "contamination" is used to describe harmful intrusions, such as the presence of [[toxin]]s or [[pathogen]]s in [[food]] or [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, see [[food contaminant]].
*In [[forensic science]], a contaminant can be [[fingerprint]]s, [[hair]], [[human skin|skin]] or [[DNA]] from [[first responder]]s or from sources not related to the ongoing investigation, such as family members or friends of the victim who are not suspects. 
*In the [[biology|biological sciences]], accidental introduction of "foreign" material ('contamination') can seriously distort the results of experiments where small samples are used. In cases where the contaminant is a living [[microorganism]], it can often multiply and take over the experiment, especially cultures, and render them useless.
*In [[geology]] and especially [[geochemistry]], it can have similar effects where even a few grains of "modern" dust can distort results of sophisticated experiments.
*the term "contamination" is sometimes used to describe accidental transfers of organisms from one natural environment to another.
*it has even been used in the "directed [[panspermia]]" hypothesis about the origin of life on Earth, which suggests that visiting aliens accidentally infected the planet with [[microbe]]s from their own world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5842">'''Cultural analytics''' is the exploration and analysis of massive [[Culture|cultural]] data sets of visual material – both digitized visual artifacts and contemporary visual and interactive media.  Taking on the challenge of how to best explore large collections of rich cultural content, cultural analytics researchers developed new methods and intuitive visual techniques which rely on high-resolution [[visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]] and [[digital image processing]]. These methods are used to address both the existing research questions in humanities, to explore new questions, and to develop new theoretical concepts which fit the mega-scale of [[digital culture]] in the early 21st century.

== History ==
The term "cultural analytics" was coined by [[Lev Manovich]] in 2007. Cultural analytics shares many ideas and approaches with [[visual analytics]] ("the science of analytical reasoning facilitated by visual interactive interfaces") and visual [[data analysis]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Visual data analysis blends highly advanced computational methods with sophisticated graphics engines to tap the extraordinary ability of humans to see patterns and structure in even the most complex visual presentations. Currently applied to massive, heterogeneous, and dynamic datasets, such as those generated in studies of astrophysical, fluidic, biological, and other complex processes, the techniques have become sophisticated enough to allow the interactive manipulation of variables in real time. Ultra high-resolution displays allow teams of researchers to zoom in to examine specific aspects of the renderings, or to navigate along interesting visual pathways, following their intuitions and even hunches to see where they may lead. New research is now beginning to apply these sorts of tools to the social sciences and humanities as well, and the techniques offer considerable promise in helping us understand complex social processes like learning, political and organizational change, and the diffusion of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four to Five Years: Visual Data Analysis|url=http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2010/chapters/visual-data-analysis/|work=2010 Horizon Report|publisher=The New Media Consortium|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810143644/http://wp.nmc.org/horizon2010/chapters/visual-data-analysis/|archivedate=2011-08-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

While increased computing power and technical developments allowing for interaction visualization have made the exploration of large data sets using visual presentations possible, the intellectual drive to understand cultural and social processes and production pre-dates many of these computational advances. Charles Joseph Minard's famous dense graphic showing Napoleon's March on Moscow&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/minard Napoleon's March on Moscow]&lt;/ref&gt; (1869) offers a 19th-century example. More recently, [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s historical survey of the cultural consumption practices of mid-century Parisians, documented in [[La Distinction]], foregrounds the study of culture and aesthetics through the lens of large data sets.

== Current research ==
To date, cultural analytics techniques have been applied to films, animations, video games, comics, magazines, books, and other print publications, artworks, photos, and a variety of other media content.  The technology used ranges from open-source programs downloadable on any personal computer to supercomputer processing and large-scale displays such as the HIPerSpace (42,000 x 8000 pixels).&lt;ref&gt;[http://vis.ucsd.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Research_Projects:_HIPerSpace HIPerSpace]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodologies ==
The methodologies which fall under the umbrella of cultural analytics includes the [[data mining]] of large sets of culturally-relevant data (such as studies of library catalogs, image collections, and social networking databases.) [[Image processing]] of still and moving video, with feature recognition as well as image data extraction is used to support research into cultural and historical change. Cultural analytical methodologies are deployed to study and interpret videogames and other software forms, both at the phenomonological level ([[human-computer interface]], feature extraction) or at the object level (the analysis of source code.)

Cultural analytics relies heavily on software-based tools, and the field is related to the nascent discipline of [[software studies]]. While the objects of a cultural analytical approach are often digitized representations of the work, rather than the work in its original material form, the objects of study need not be digital works in themselves.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15227">DNA '''re-replication''' (or simply '''rereplication''') is an undesirable and possibly fatal occurrence in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]] in which the genome is replicated more than once per [[cell cycle]].&lt;ref name="Arias"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arias EE, Walter JC | title = Strength in numbers: preventing rereplication via multiple mechanisms in eukaryotic cells | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 21 | issue = 5 | pages = 497–518 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17344412 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1508907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Rereplication is believed to lead to [[Genome instability|genomic instability]] and has been implicated in the [[Pathology|pathologies]] of a variety of human [[cancer]]s.&lt;ref name="Truong"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Truong LN, Wu X | title = Prevention of DNA re-replication in eukaryotic cells | journal = Journal of Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–22 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21278447 | pmc = 3030972 | doi = 10.1093/jmcb/mjq052 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent rereplication, eukaryotic cells have [[Evolution|evolved]] multiple, overlapping mechanisms to inhibit chromosomal [[DNA]] from being partially or fully rereplicated in a given cell cycle.  These control mechanisms rely on [[cyclin-dependent kinase]] (CDK) activity.&lt;ref name="Arias" /&gt; [[DNA replication]] control mechanisms cooperate to prevent the relicensing of [[Origin of replication|replication origins]] and to activate cell cycle and DNA damage [[Cell cycle checkpoint|checkpoints]].&lt;ref name="Truong" /&gt; DNA rereplication must be strictly regulated to ensure that genomic information is faithfully transmitted through successive generations.

==Origin licensing==
All known mechanisms that prevent DNA rereplication in eukaryotic organisms inhibit origin licensing.&lt;ref name="Arias" /&gt; Origin licensing is the preliminary step for normal replication initiation during late [[G1 phase|G1]] and early [[S phase]] and involves the recruitment of the [[Pre-replication complex|pre-replicative complex]] (pre-RC) to the [[Origin of replication|replication origins]].  Licensing begins with the binding of the multi-subunit [[ATPase]], the [[origin recognition complex]] (ORC), to the DNA at the replication origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cvetic CA, Walter JC | title = Getting a grip on licensing: mechanism of stable Mcm2-7 loading onto replication origins | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–4 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16427002 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2006.01.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once bound to [[chromatin]] the ORC recruits the [[AAA proteins|AAA+]] ATPase [[Cdc6]] and the [[Coiled coil|coiled-coil domain]] protein [[DNA replication factor CDT1|Cdt1]].  Cdt1 binding and the ATPase activity of ORC and Cdc6 facilitate the loading of the  [[minichromosome maintenance]] (MCM) proteins 2-7 onto the chromatin.&lt;ref name="Arias" /&gt;  The MCM complex is the [[DNA helicase]] that opens the helix at the replication origin and unwinds the two strands as the [[replication fork]]s travel along the DNA.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morgan|first=David O.|title=The Cell Cycle: Principles of Control|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-87893-508-8}}{{Page needed|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Elevated CDK activity at the end of G1 triggers the firing of the origins and the dismantling of the pre-RCs.  High CDK levels, which are maintained until the end of [[mitosis]], inhibit or destroy pre-RC components and prevent the origin from relicensing.  A new MCM complex cannot be loaded onto the origin until the pre-RC subunits are reactivated with the decline of CDK activity at the end of mitosis.  Thus, CDKs serve a dual role in the regulation of eukaryotic DNA replication: elevated CDK activity initiates replication at the origins and prevents rereplication by inhibiting origin re-licensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bell SP, Dutta A | title = DNA replication in eukaryotic cells | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 71 | pages = 333–74 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12045100 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.110601.135425 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Broek D, Bartlett R, Crawford K, Nurse P | title = Involvement of p34cdc2 in establishing the dependency of S phase on mitosis | journal = Nature | volume = 349 | issue = 6308 | pages = 388–93 | date = January 1991 | pmid = 1992340 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/349388a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hayles J, Fisher D, Woollard A, Nurse P | title = Temporal order of S phase and mitosis in fission yeast is determined by the state of the p34cdc2-mitotic B cyclin complex | journal = Cell | volume = 78 | issue = 5 | pages = 813–22 | date = September 1994 | pmid = 8087848 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(94)90542-8 | authorlink4 = Paul Nurse | authorlink3 = Alison Woollard }}&lt;/ref&gt;   This ensures that no replication origin fires twice in the same cell cycle.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;

==Two-state model for DNA replication regulation==

[[File:Inhibition of pre-RC assembly.png|thumb|360px|''S. cerevisiae'' origin in the postreplicative state. CDK-mediated phosphorylation of the pre-RC components prevents origins from re-licensing.]]

Early experimental evidence on the regulation of DNA replication suggests that replication origins exist in one of two states during the cell cycle: a prereplicative state in G1 and a postreplicative state from the moment of initiation until passage through mitosis.&lt;ref name="Arias" /&gt;  Origins of replication alternate between these two distinct states during the cell cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Diffley JF, Cocker JH, Dowell SJ, Rowley A | title = Two steps in the assembly of complexes at yeast replication origins in vivo | journal = Cell | volume = 78 | issue = 2 | pages = 303–16 | date = July 1994 | pmid = 8044842 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(94)90299-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[licensing factor]] which is required for replication initiation binds to origins in the prereplicative state.  At the [[G1/S transition]], the factor is inactivated and cannot be restored until the cell cycle has concluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blow JJ, Laskey RA | title = A role for the nuclear envelope in controlling DNA replication within the cell cycle | journal = Nature | volume = 332 | issue = 6164 | pages = 546–8 | date = April 1988 | pmid = 3357511 | doi = 10.1038/332546a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The identification and characterization of the ORC, Cdc6, Cdt1, and the MCM complex proteins as the licensing factor gives credence to this model and suggests a means by which the oscillatory nature of CDKs in the cell cycle can regulate rereplication.&lt;ref name="Arias" /&gt;

==Replication regulation==

===Budding yeast===

Rereplication regulation is best understood in budding yeast.  ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' cells prevent rereplication by directly regulating pre-RC assembly through the CDK-mediated [[phosphorylation]] of the pre-RC components Cdc6, MCM2-7, and the ORC subunits.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;  The phosphorylation of these components is initiated at the onset of S phase and is maintained throughout the rest of the cell cycle as CDK activity remains high.  Phosphorylated Cdc6 is bound by the [[Ubiquitin ligase|ubiquitin-protein ligase]] SCF which leads to its [[Proteolysis|proteolytic degradation]].  CDK-dependent phosphorylation of the MCM2-7 proteins results in the complex’s export from the [[Nucleus (cell)|nucleus]].  (Cdt1 which associates with the MCM complex is similarly exported from the nucleus).  Phosphorylation of the ORC subunits presumably disrupts the ORC’s ability to bind other pre-RC components.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;  Thus, multiple mechanisms ensure that the pre-RC cannot be reassembled on postreplicative origins.

'''''Note:''''' Since origins fire at different times throughout S phase, it is crucial that the inhibitory mechanisms that prevent new MCM2-7 recruitment do not destabilize existing pre-RCs.  Pre-RCs can remain assembled on origins that haven’t fired even though rereplication inhibitory mechanisms are inhibiting or destroying pre-RC components.

===Other organisms===
Although CDK regulation of pre-RC assembly appears to be highly [[Conserved sequence|evolutionarily conserved]], some differences across organisms are noted.  In multicellular eukaryotes pre-RC assembly is regulated by the [[anaphase-promoting complex]] (APC) in addition to CDKs.  APC, an [[Ubiquitin ligase|E3 enzyme]], [[ubiquitin]]ates the protein [[geminin]] and targets it for degradation.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;  Geminin normally prevents origin licensing by binding to and inhibiting Cdt1.  In G1, APC activity is adequate to suppress the accumulation of geminin, thereby indirectly promoting pre-RC assembly.  At the end of G1, APC is inactivated and geminin can accumulate and prevent origin re-licensing.

Pre-RC regulation in most animals is not well understood.&lt;ref name="Morgan" /&gt;

==Consequences of rereplication in eukaryotic cells==
Rereplication and mitotic failure are generally not programmed events, but rather result spontaneously from defects in the cell cycle machinery.&lt;ref name="Arias" /&gt; Rereplication appears to give rise to dsDNA breaks which triggers a DNA damage response and arrests cells in G2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Green BM, Li JJ | title = Loss of rereplication control in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in extensive DNA damage | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 421–32 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15537702 | pmc = 539184 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.E04-09-0833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The checkpoint effectively causes a permanent cell cycle arrest and eventual [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Archambault V, Ikui AE, Drapkin BJ, Cross FR | title = Disruption of mechanisms that prevent rereplication triggers a DNA damage response | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 25 | issue = 15 | pages = 6707–21 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16024805 | pmc = 1190345 | doi = 10.1128/MCB.25.15.6707-6721.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rereplication can be experimentally induced by simultaneously disrupting several of the mechanisms that prevent origin re-licensing.  For example, deregulation of the ORC, MCM2-7 and Cdc6 mechanisms can induce rereplication in budding yeast cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nguyen VQ, Co C, Li JJ | title = Cyclin-dependent kinases prevent DNA re-replication through multiple mechanisms | journal = Nature | volume = 411 | issue = 6841 | pages = 1068–73 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11429609 | doi = 10.1038/35082600 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Note:''''' Recent evidence suggests that although overlapping, the multiple replication regulation mechanisms should not be considered as functionally redundant; although a single mechanism may repress rereplication at greater than 99% efficiency, it may not be sufficient to maintain genome stability over many generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Green BM, Morreale RJ, Ozaydin B, Derisi JL, Li JJ | title = Genome-wide mapping of DNA synthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals that mechanisms preventing reinitiation of DNA replication are not redundant | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 2401–14 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16481397 | pmc = 1446083 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.E05-11-1043 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is believed{{by whom|date=December 2011}} that the multiplicative effect of many overlapping mechanisms is what sufficiently prevents rereplication and ensures the faithful transmission of a cell’s [[genome]].

==Rereplication in cancer==
Rereplication has been implicated in [[tumorigenesis]] in [[model organism]]s and [[human]]s.  Replication initiation proteins are overexpressed in tissue samples from several types of human cancers&lt;ref name="Arias" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Blow JJ, Gillespie PJ | title = Replication licensing and cancer--a fatal entanglement? | journal = Nature Reviews.

}}

The '''discourse of power''' is used when it comes to differentiating the levels of [[Power (social and political)|power]] due to cultural and social characteristics that come about through societal upbringing. The ways we think and talk about a subject influence and reflect the ways we act in relation to that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karlburg|first1=Michael|title=The Power of Discourse and the Discourse of Power: Pursuing Peace Through Discourse Intervention|url=http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol10_1/Karlberg_101IJPS.pdf|website=International Journal of Peace Studies|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea of the discourse of power within media has a domino effect and it can play a huge role in determining the patterns of access to the mass media: who has preferential access to journalists, who will be interviewed, who will be quoted and described in news reports, and whose opinions will influence the public? Through access to the mass media, dominant groups also may have access to and partial control over the public at large.&lt;ref name="Discourse Power and Access"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Dijk|first1=Teun|title=Discourse Power and Access|url=http://www.discourses.org/OldArticles/Discourse,%20power%20and%20access.pdf|website=discourse.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The role of mass media and power in the United States ==
{{See also|Media of the United States}}

Those with power and influence know that media control or influence is crucial. A free press is crucial for a functioning democracy, but if not truly free, paves the way for manipulation and concentration of views, thus undermining democracy itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shah|first1=Anup|title=Media in the United States|url=http://www.globalissues.org/article/163/media-in-the-united-states|website=Global Issues|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=28 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First Amendment to the U.S Constitution, which provides that "Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press," has given the media an exceptionally strong basis for resisting government controls in the United States. A limited number of controls, such as regulatory laws, court decisions, and informational social pressures guard against excess by the media. In the United States courts have been loath to impose restraints prior to publication, such as granting injunctions that would stop publication of information on the grounds that it would cause irreparable harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graber|first1=Doris|last2=Dunaway|first2=Johanna|title=Mass media and American politics|date=2015|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781452287287|edition=9th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=27 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major mass media conglomerates in the United States===

*[[General Electric]]

These media conglomerates control 90% of the traditional media that is present in our daily lives, media has never been more consolidated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lutz|first1=Ashley|title=These 6 Corporations Control 90% of the Media in America|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6|website=Business Insider|accessdate=27 April 2015|date=14 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power of media versus reality==
The shaping of ones reality or perception is based on three elements including experienced reality, symbolic reality, and socially constructed reality. Much of the symbolic reality is based on media practices that we are exposed to daily. Individuals make assumptions on the world based on what their media tells them. The media is a [[hegemony|hegemonic]] form of power that maintains their position, not through force, but through elaboration of a particular world view, an ideology, or a particular notion of common sense, which is widely infused into everyday cultural practices. This results in people consenting to power even when it may not be in their best interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bybee|first1=Carl|title=Mass Media and Society|url=http://journalism.uoregon.edu/~cbybee/j201/overheads/hegemony_def.htm|website=University of Oregon - Journalism Department}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of media hegemony is that the ideas of the ruling class become ruling ideas in society, because of this the mass media are controlled by the dominant class in society which uses it as a vehicle for exerting control over the rest of society.&lt;ref name="Discourse Power and Access"/&gt;

=== Socially constructed reality ===
[[Social constructionism|Social construct]] examines the development of jointly constructed understandings of the world. It assumes that understanding, significance, and meaning are developed not separately within the individual, but in coordination among other human beings. To say something that it is socially constructed is to emphasize its dependence on contingent aspects of an individuals social selves. It can say this thing could not have existed had we not built it. Had someone been brought up in a different kind of society, had different needs, values, or interests, an individual might have built a different kind of thing, or built this social construct differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Boghossian|first1=Paul|title=What is Social Construction?|url=http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/docs/IO/1153/socialconstruction.pdf|website=New York University}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to be aware that the values we hold, the beliefs we harbor and the decisions we make are based on our assumptions, our experiences, our education and what we know for a fact. Social construct allows us rely on mass media for the current news and facts about what is important and what we should be aware of.  We trust the media as an authority for news, information, education and entertainment. Considering that powerful influence, then, we should know how it really works. The degree of influence depends on the availability and pervasiveness of media.  Traditional mass media still has a great influence within society today. Books once were supremely influential because they came first before newspapers, magazines, radio or television. Newspapers and magazines became large influencers after they were developed. Sound recordings and film were and still are influential. Radio and then television were very influential. As the 20th century closed, TV exposed us to a number of new examples advertising and marketing, suffering and relief, sexuality and violence, celebrity entertainment, and much more. New and influential media-distribution channels have appeared in the 21st century. We are currently being influenced through the internet by daily by blogs, popular culture websites and various social media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Curtis|first1=A|title=Mass Media Influence on Society|url=http://www2.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Media&amp;Society/MassMediaInfluenceOnSociety.html|website=University of North Carolina Pembroke|accessdate=27 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215065257/http://www.uncp.edu/home/acurtis/Courses/ResourcesForCourses/Media%26Society/MassMediaInfluenceOnSociety.html|archivedate=15 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experienced reality===
Experienced reality is that reality that comes to us via the senses and also via insight or intuition. It underlies all of our cognitive efforts. Because direct experience is largely sensory, automatic and constant, we pay less attention to it than the reality we have to work at to construct. It is somewhat of an illusion that effort equates to importance in our culture.&lt;ref name="Guide to Reality"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baggott|first1=Jim|title=A beginner's guide to reality : [exploring our everyday adventures in wonderland]|date=2006|publisher=Pegasus books|location=New York|isbn=9781933648040|edition=1st Pegasus Books}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 May 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Events or experiences spark change in an individual. Through societal influence we are becoming a generation that needs to see to believe, and experienced reality is what initiates this idea. Power through this idea of experienced reality is relayed through the ideologies of the major media conglomerates and the way that they have created such a large cultural bias towards what we have experienced.

===Symbolic reality===
Symbols exist everywhere for an individual. Symbols are the intermediary between the world internal and the world external, between inner and external reality of human being as a person. The appeal to symbolic reality allows us to overcome [[personal boundaries]] including power struggles. Symbolic reality exists in and through person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ekaterina|first1=Dr. Dvoretskaya|title=Personal approach to Symbolic reality|url=http://www.crvp.org/seminar/05-seminar/Ekaterina.htm|website=Council for Research in Values and Philosophy|accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols are objects, characters, or other representations of ideas, concepts, or abstractions; they are the universal language in a culture. Symbols have been used for thousands of years, they help individuals communicate and interact with one another. Thus, as a representation, their meaning is neither instinctive nor automatic. The culture’s members must interpret, and over time reinterpret, Symbols convey meaning and occur in different forms, such as: verbal or nonverbal, written or unwritten, words on the page, drawings, pictures, gesture. They are things which act as triggers to remind people, in the culture, of its rules, beliefs… Symbols can also be used to indicate status within a culture. Every society has evolved a system of symbols that reflects a specific cultural logic; and every symbolism functions to communicate information between members in much the same way as, but more subtly than, conventional language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Power of Symbols|url=http://bizshifts-trends.com/2012/01/23/power-of-symbols-symbolisms-and-brand-in-developing-global-markets-anthropology-of-business-marketing-leadership/|website=Business Shifts and Trends|accessdate=5 May 2015|date=23 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the level of power, media conglomerates have been using symbolic reality to relay their messages for years.

In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''drag coefficient''' (commonly denoted as: &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm x\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm w\,&lt;/math&gt;) is a [[dimensionless quantity]] that is used to quantify the [[drag (physics)|drag]] or resistance of an object in a fluid environment, such as air or water. It is used in the [[drag equation]] in which a lower drag coefficient indicates the object will have less [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] or [[Hydrodynamics|hydrodynamic]] drag. The drag coefficient is always associated with a particular surface area.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Barnes W. (1979): ''Aerodynamics, Aeronautics, and Flight Mechanics''. p. 24, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., New York, {{ISBN|0-471-03032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drag coefficient of any object comprises the effects of the two basic contributors to [[Fluid dynamics|fluid dynamic]] drag: [[skin friction]] and [[form drag]]. The drag coefficient of a lifting [[airfoil]] or [[hydrofoil]] also includes the effects of [[lift-induced drag]].&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Section 5.18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ira H. Abbott|Abbott, Ira H.]], and Von Doenhoff, Albert E.: ''Theory of Wing Sections''. Sections 1.2 and 1.3&lt;/ref&gt; The drag coefficient of a complete structure such as an aircraft also includes the effects of [[interference drag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wright.nasa.gov/airplane/drageq.html |title=NASA’s Modern Drag Equation |publisher=Wright.nasa.gov |date=2010-03-25 |accessdate=2010-12-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302020853/http://wright.nasa.gov/airplane/drageq.html |archivedate=2011-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Section 11.17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The drag coefficient &lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm d = \dfrac{ 2F_\mathrm d}{ \rho u^2 A}\, &lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[drag (physics)|drag force]], which is by definition the force component in the direction of the [[flow velocity]],&lt;ref&gt;See [[lift force]] and [[vortex induced vibration]] for a possible force components transverse to the flow direction.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\rho\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mass density]] of the fluid,&lt;ref&gt;Note that for the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the air density can be found using the [[barometric formula]]. Air is 1.293 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]].&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[flow speed]] of the object relative to the fluid,
:&lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; is the reference [[area]].

The reference area depends on what type of drag coefficient is being measured. For automobiles and many other objects, the reference area is the projected frontal area of the vehicle. This may not necessarily be the cross sectional area of the vehicle, depending on where the cross section is taken. For example, for a sphere &lt;math&gt;A = \pi r^2\,&lt;/math&gt; (note this is not the surface area = &lt;math&gt;\!\ 4 \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;).

For [[airfoil]]s, the reference area is the nominal wing area. Since this tends to be large compared to the frontal area, the resulting drag coefficients tend to be low, much lower than for a car with the same drag, frontal area, and speed.

[[Airship]]s and some [[Solid of revolution|bodies of revolution]] use the volumetric drag coefficient, in which the reference area is the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the [[cube root]] of the airship volume (volume to the two-thirds power). Submerged streamlined bodies use the wetted surface area.

Two objects having the same reference area moving at the same speed through a fluid will experience a drag force proportional to their respective drag coefficients. Coefficients for unstreamlined objects can be 1 or more, for streamlined objects much less.

==Background==
[[Image:Cd flat plate.svg|thumb|right|200px|Flow around a plate, showing stagnation.]]
{{Main|Drag equation}}

The drag equation

:&lt;math&gt;F_d\, =\, \tfrac12\, \rho\, u^2\, c_d\, A&lt;/math&gt;

is essentially a statement that the [[Drag (physics)|drag]] [[force]] on any object is proportional to the density of the fluid and proportional to the square of the relative [[flow speed]] between the object and the fluid.

''C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' is not a constant but varies as a function of flow speed, flow direction, object position, object size, fluid density and fluid [[viscosity]]. Speed, [[kinematic viscosity]] and a characteristic [[length scale]] of the object are incorporated into a dimensionless quantity called the [[Reynolds number]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Re&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is thus a function of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Re&lt;/math&gt;. In a compressible flow, the speed of sound is relevant, and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is also a function of [[Mach number]] &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Ma&lt;/math&gt;.

For certain body shapes, the drag coefficient &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; only depends on the Reynolds number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Re\,&lt;/math&gt;, Mach number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Ma\,&lt;/math&gt; and the direction of the flow. For low Mach number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Ma&lt;/math&gt;, the drag coefficient is independent of Mach number. Also, the variation with Reynolds number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Re\,&lt;/math&gt; within a practical range of interest is usually small, while for cars at highway speed and aircraft at cruising speed, the incoming flow direction is also more-or-less the same. Therefore, the drag coefficient &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; can often be treated as a constant.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Sections 4.15 and 5.4&lt;/ref&gt;

For a streamlined body to achieve a low drag coefficient, the [[boundary layer]] around the body must remain attached to the surface of the body for as long as possible, causing the [[wake]] to be narrow. A high ''form drag'' results in a broad wake. The boundary layer will transition from laminar to turbulent if Reynolds number of the flow around the body is sufficiently great. Larger velocities, larger objects, and lower [[viscosity|viscosities]] contribute to larger Reynolds numbers.&lt;ref name=Clancy_4.17&gt;Clancy, L. J.: ''Aerodynamics''. Section 4.17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drag coefficient on a sphere vs. Reynolds number - main trends.svg|thumb|Drag coefficient ''C''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; for a sphere as a function of [[Reynolds number]] ''Re'', as obtained from laboratory experiments. The dark line is for a sphere with a smooth surface, while the lighter line is for the case of a rough surface. The numbers along the line indicate several flow regimes and associated changes in the drag coefficient:&lt;br&gt;
•2: attached flow ([[Stokes flow]]) and [[steady flow|steady]] [[flow separation|separated flow]],&lt;br&gt;
•3: separated unsteady flow, having a [[laminar flow]] [[boundary layer]] upstream of the separation, and producing a [[vortex street]],&lt;br&gt;
•4: separated unsteady flow with a laminar boundary layer at the upstream side, before flow separation, with downstream of the sphere a chaotic [[turbulence|turbulent]] wake,&lt;br&gt;
•5: post-critical separated flow, with a turbulent boundary layer.]]
For other objects, such as small particles, one can no longer consider that the drag coefficient &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is constant, but certainly is a function of Reynolds number.&lt;ref&gt;Clift R., Grace J. R., Weber M. E.: ''Bubbles, drops, and particles''. Academic Press NY (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Briens C. L.: ''Powder Technology''. 67, 1991, 87-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haider A., Levenspiel O.: ''Powder Technology''. 58, 1989, 63-70.&lt;/ref&gt;
At a low Reynolds number, the flow around the object does not transition to turbulent but remains laminar, even up to the point at which it separates from the surface of the object. At very low Reynolds numbers, without flow separation, the drag force &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle F_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v\,&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle v^2\,&lt;/math&gt;; for a sphere this is known as [[Stokes' law|Stokes law]]. The Reynolds number will be low for small objects, low velocities, and high viscosity fluids.&lt;ref name=Clancy_4.17/&gt;

A &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; equal to 1 would be obtained in a case where all of the fluid approaching the object is brought to rest, building up [[stagnation pressure]] over the whole front surface. The top figure shows a flat plate with the fluid coming from the right and stopping at the plate. The graph to the left of it shows equal pressure across the surface. In a real flat plate, the fluid must turn around the sides, and full stagnation pressure is found only at the center, dropping off toward the edges as in the lower figure and graph. Only considering the front side, the &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; of a real flat plate would be less than 1; except that there will be suction on the back side: a negative pressure (relative to ambient). The overall &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; of a real square flat plate perpendicular to the flow is often given as 1.17.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Flow patterns and therefore &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle C_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; for some shapes can change with the Reynolds number and the roughness of the surfaces.
&lt;!-- and there should be examples of other simple shapes --&gt;

==Drag coefficient ''c''&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; examples==

===General===
In general, &lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; is not an absolute constant for a given body shape. It varies with the speed of airflow (or more generally with [[Reynolds number]] &lt;math&gt;Re&lt;/math&gt;). A smooth sphere, for example, has a &lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt; that varies from high values for [[laminar flow]] to 0.47 for [[turbulent flow]].  Although the drag coefficient decreases with increasing &lt;math&gt;Re&lt;/math&gt;, the drag force increases.

==Aircraft==
As noted above, aircraft use their wing area as the reference area when computing &lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm d\,&lt;/math&gt;, while automobiles (and many other objects) use frontal cross sectional area; thus, coefficients are '''not''' directly comparable between these classes of vehicles. In the aerospace industry, the drag coefficient is sometimes expressed in drag counts where 1 [[drag count]] = 0.0001 of a &lt;math&gt;C_d&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Basha, W. A. and Ghaly, W.

==Blunt and streamlined body flows==

===Concept===

Drag, in the context of [[fluid dynamics]], refers to forces that act on a solid object in the direction of the relative flow velocity (note that the diagram below shows the drag in the opposite direction to the flow). The aerodynamic forces on a body come primarily from differences in pressure and viscous shearing stresses. Thereby, the drag force on a body could be divided into two components, namely frictional drag (viscous drag) and pressure drag (form drag). The net drag force could be decomposed as follows:
[[File:Aerodynamics of Airfoil.jpg|thumb|Flow across an airfoil showing the relative impact of drag force to the direction of motion of fluid over the body. This drag force gets divided into frictional drag and pressure drag. The same airfoil is considered as a streamlined body if friction drag (viscous drag) dominates pressure drag and is considered a blunt body when pressure drag (form drag) dominates friction drag.]]

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
c_\mathrm d &amp;= \dfrac{2 F_\mathrm d}{\rho v^2 A}\ \\
&amp;= c_\mathrm p + c_\mathrm f \\
&amp;= \underbrace{ \dfrac{1}{\rho v^2 A}\ \displaystyle \int\limits_{S} \mathrm{d}A \, (p-p_o) \left(\hat{\mathbf{n}} \sdot \hat{\mathbf{i}}\right) }_{ c_\mathrm p }+ \underbrace{ \dfrac{1}{\rho v^2 A}\ \displaystyle \int\limits_{S} \mathrm{d}A \, \left(\hat{\mathbf{t}} \sdot \hat{\mathbf{i}}\right) T_w }_{ c_\mathrm f} 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm p\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[pressure]] drag coefficient, 
:&lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm f\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[friction]] drag coefficient,
:&lt;math&gt;\hat \mathbf{t} &lt;/math&gt; = Tangential direction to the surface with area dA,
:&lt;math&gt;\hat \mathbf{n} &lt;/math&gt; = Normal direction to the surface with area dA,
:&lt;math&gt;T_\mathrm w\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[shear Stress]] acting on the surface dA,
:&lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm o\,&lt;/math&gt; is the pressure far away from the surface dA,
:&lt;math&gt;p\,&lt;/math&gt; is pressure at surface dA,
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{i}}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector in direction of free stream flow

Therefore, when the drag is dominated by a frictional component, the body is called a '''streamlined body'''; whereas in the case of dominant pressure drag, the body is called a '''blunt body'''. Thus, the shape of the body and the angle of attack determine the type of drag. For example, an airfoil is considered as a body with a small angle of attack by the fluid flowing across it. This means that it has attached [[boundary layer]]s, which produce much less pressure drag.
[[File:Drag curves for aircraft in flight.svg|thumb|Trade-off relationship between zero-lift drag and lift induced drag]]
The [[wake]] produced is very small and drag is dominated by the friction component. Therefore, such a body (here an airfoil) is described as streamlined, whereas for bodies with fluid flow at high angles of attack, boundary layer separation takes place. This mainly occurs due to adverse [[pressure gradient]]s at the top and rear parts of an [[airfoil]].

Due to this, wake formation takes place, which consequently leads to eddy formation and pressure loss due to pressure drag. In such situations, the airfoil is [[Stall (flight)|stalled]] and has higher pressure drag than friction drag. In this case, the body is described as a blunt body.

A streamlined body looks like a fish ([[Tuna]], [[Oropesa (minesweeping)|Oropesa]], etc.) or an airfoil with small angle of attack, whereas a blunt body looks like a brick, a cylinder or an airfoil with high angle of attack. For a given frontal area and velocity, a streamlined body will have lower resistance than a blunt body. Cylinders and spheres are taken as blunt bodies because the drag is dominated by the pressure component in the wake region at high [[Reynolds number]].

To reduce this drag, either the flow separation could be reduced or the surface area in contact with the fluid could be reduced (to reduce friction drag). This reduction is necessary in devices like cars, bicycle, etc. to avoid vibration and noise production.

====Practical example====
The [[Automotive aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] design of cars has evolved from the 1920s to the end of the 20th century. This change in design from a blunt body to a more streamlined body reduced the drag coefficient from about 0.95 to 0.30.

[[File:Aerodynamic Drag of Car.jpg|centre|Time history of aerodynamic drag of cars in comparison with change in geometry of streamlined bodies (blunt to streamline).]]

[[Image:St Stephen's Church (1).JPG|thumb|right|300px|St Stephen's Church in St Albans, the legal owner of the Dunkeld Lectern]]

The '''Dunkeld Lectern''' is a [[mediaeval]] [[lectern]] which was one of the most prized possessions of [[St. Stephen's Church, St. Albans|St Stephen's Church]], [[St Albans]].  The 150&amp;nbsp;kg brass reading desk stood approximately 1.6&amp;nbsp;metres high and took the form of a large [[eagle]] with outspread wings with the bird perched on an orb supported by a turned shaft - an [[eagle lectern]].  Engraved on the orb was a [[Latin language|Latin]] inscription - ''Georgius Creichton Episcopus Dunkeldensis'' (translation: 'George Creichton Bishop of Dunkeld').  [[George Crichton]] was abbot at [[Holyrood Abbey]] in [[Edinburgh]] from 1515 to 1522, and it is believed that he was presented the lectern to the Abbey on being made [[Bishop of Dunkeld]] by [[Pope Alexander VI]]. The lectern was plundered by English invaders in 1544, lost (and recovered) in the [[English Civil War]], and stolen by a group of Scottish nationalists in 1984. On two occasions the lectern was hidden in a [[Grave (burial)|grave]].  It remains the subject of dispute.

==History==

In the autumn of 1543 [[Scotland]] and [[England]] signed two agreements which are often referred to as "The [[Treaties of Greenwich]]".  The first guaranteed peace between the two countries for a fixed period of time and the second affirmed that an [[arranged marriage]] would take place between [[Edward VI of England|Prince Edward of England]], the son of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], and [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], soon after her tenth birthday.

At the beginning of 1544 the relationship between England and Scotland began to worsen as it had done so many times before. The Scots reneged on the treaties which drove Henry VIII into a fury.  His response was swift and brutal. He directed the commander-in-chief of the English army, the [[Earl of Hertford]] to "... put all to fyre and sworde, burne Edinborough town... [so it] may remayn forever a perpetuel memory of the vengeance of God... for their [the Scots] faulsehode and disloyailtye... over throwe the castle, sack Holyrod house".

In May 1544, the English army arrived by [[Burning of Edinburgh (1544)|boat to destroy Edinburgh]]. The army landed near the port of [[Leith]] from whence it marched on [[Edinburgh]].  The invaders pillaged and laid waste the town, and the surrounding areas and villages, excepting only the castle.  They destroyed [[Holyrood Abbey]] and carried off much of its property as plunder.  Henry hoped his aggression would force the Scots to accept the marriage treaty.

The Earl of Hertford was accompanied to Edinburgh by [[Richard Lee (engineer)|Sir Richard Lee]] who was a military engineer - a destroyer and builder of fortifications.  His services to the English crown for his work in Scotland (and elsewhere) was formally recognised in 1544 when he was knighted and appointed Surveyor of the King's Works.  He was granted the ground covered by St Albans monastery (but not the church which was bought by the townspeople), [[Sopwell Priory]], and the rectorship of [[St. Stephen's Church, St. Albans|St Stephen's church]].

This fact, when taken with circumstantial evidence, suggests it was probably at this time the Holyrood Abbey lectern found its way into this Hertfordshire church, with the other Scottish plunder of Sir Richard Lee.

===English Civil War===

In 1642 the [[English Civil War]] began and St Albans became a Parliamentarian stronghold.  Parliament passed new laws which authorised the destruction of religious images and articles.  In response many religious items and artefacts were hidden by Anglican clergy from their Puritan prosecutors.  In August 1643 more draconian measures were introduced and continuity of the St Stephen's parish registers is broken perhaps hinting at the turbulent nature of those times.

It was during this period of national upheaval that the lectern disappeared.  Who removed it and exactly why remains a mystery to this day. Over 100 years were to pass before the lectern came to light once more.

In 1748 the Montagu family tomb in the chancel of St Stephen's church was opened up for an interment and the lectern was found lying in the grave. It was retrieved and brought back into the use.

==Scottish requests for return==

Since the eighteenth century Scottish academics, clergy and Scottish patriots have sought the return of the lectern.  A review of the history of the lectern in the newspaper ''[[Scottish Guardian|The Scottish Guardian]]'' dated 2 May 1879, finished with a plea for readers to find a way to "... secure the lectern for our new Cathedral in Edinburgh.  Who will take up the matter?"

In November 1879 an approach from the [[Lord Provost of Edinburgh]] was rebuffed by the vicar of St Stephen's, the Rev Marcus R. Southwell.  In December of that year he wrote to the Lord Provost, sent his best wishes and expressed the "utmost repugnance to parting with the Crichton lectern."  The Dean of the [[Order of the Thistle]] and Chapel Royal fared no better in 1914.  Nor did further approaches made by Edinburgh corporation in 1931 and 1936.

===Attempted theft===

One day in 1972 the lectern was found lying in pieces halfway down the nave of the church.  Intruders were disturbed in the course of their nefarious activities, but did not leave empty handed, taking with them three small lions from the base which supported the lectern.

===Return===

In 1982 the lectern returned to Scotland for the first time in over 400&amp;nbsp;years.  Permission was given by the [[Church of England]] for the lectern to appear in ''Angels, Nobles and Unicorns'' - an exhibition of mediaeval Scottish art at the [[National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland]] in Edinburgh.  Its appearance at the exhibition caused a great deal of upset and letters to the press demanded that it should remain in Scotland but when the exhibition ended the Dunkeld lectern was returned to St Stephen's church.

In the past 150&amp;nbsp;years or so, the clergy and academics have not succeeded in resolving the issue to the satisfaction of some of the Scots people.  In November 1984 a group of individuals broke into the church and removed the lectern.  The Scottish group "[[Siol nan Gaidheal]]" (Seed of the Gael) contacted the press and reported they had the lectern.  They provided a 'hostage' photograph and wrote '... This piece of our heritage is here to stay... patriotic Scots have asked for the eagle to be returned... to its rightful home.  English arrogance won the day... all requests were refused.'

In the 15 years since the lectern disappeared the rights and wrongs of the matter have been debated on television and in the press many times.  Representatives of the established churches of Scotland and England met on many occasions and invested much effort and time to resolve the matter.  Dialogue between all parties was nurtured and helped by the activities of Inverness Press and Journal reporter Mr John Vass.  He worked closely with the vicar Revd John Pragnell, Mr David Maxwell, Convenor of the Church of Scotland's Artistic Committee, and Mr David Caldwell of the Royal Museum of Scotland to get the lectern returned for permanent display in Scotland.

===Criminal endeavour prevails===

Over the years Mr Vass received a number of anonymous communications from those who held the lectern.  The "kidnappers" laid down two conditions before the Dunkeld lectern would be released.  These were that it was to stay in Scotland, and that no action would be taken to find and prosecute those responsible.  St Stephen's parish made an offer that should the lectern be forthcoming, the parish would see that it was returned to Scotland.

In recognition of this promise, St Margaret's church, Barnhill, Dundee offered St Stephen's church a Victorian eagle lectern to replace the one removed in 1984.  This Victorian lectern was a replica of the Dunkeld one.  The "Siol nan Gaidheal" failed to respond positively.  The Church of Scotland decided to proceed and present St Stephen's with the Barnhill lectern before the Revd J. Pragnell moved to his new parish.  The St Stephen's vicar had been pivotal in the efforts to bring about a satisfactory conclusion of this matter since he arrived in the parish in 1991.

==Current whereabouts==

In 1999 the Dunkeld Lectern mysteriously turned up in an Edinburgh arts centre after being missing for 15&amp;nbsp;years.  It is believed that it had been hidden in a Highland grave for the intervening period.  It has since been moved to the [[National Museums of Scotland]] and is on a three-year loan.  A permanent loan agreement is being negotiated between the National Museums of Scotland and the church of St Stephen's, still the legal owner of the Dunkeld Lectern.

In a typical power distribution grid, electric [[transformer]] power loss typically contributes about 40-50% of the total transmission and distribution loss. Energy efficient transformers are therefore an important means to reduce transmission and distribution loss.&lt;ref&gt;B. Kennedy, “Energy Efficient Transformers” McGraw-Hill, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; With the improvement of [[electrical steel]] (silicon steel) properties, the losses of a transformer in 2010 can be half that of a similar transformer in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} With new magnetic materials, it is possible to achieve even higher efficiency. The [[amorphous metal transformer]] is a modern example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jerryli.110mb.com/Asian_Energy_2000.pdf J. Li, “Use of Energy Efficient Transformers in Asia”, presented in ''Asian Energy Conference 2000'', Hong Kong]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2371">'''Enrichment culture''' is the use of certain [[growth media]] to favor the growth of a particular [[microorganism]] over others, enriching a sample for the microorganism of interest. This is generally done by introducing nutrients or environmental conditions that only allow the growth of an organism of interest. Enrichment cultures are used to increase a small number of desired organisms to detectable levels. This allows for the detection and identification of microorganisms with a variety of nutritional needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schlegel|first1=Hans G.|title=General microbiology|date=1995|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521439800|edition=7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DrHQtIbiunkC&amp;pg=PA204&amp;dq=Enrichment+culture#v=onepage&amp;q=Enrichment%20culture&amp;f=false |pages=204–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enrichment cultures are often used for soil and fecal samples. &lt;ref&gt;Tortora, Gerard J., Berdell R. Funke, and Christine L. Case. (2014). "Microbioligy: An Introduction" 12e. New York City, New York: Pearson Education. // 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The microbiologist (and botanist) [[Martinus Beijerinck]] is credited with developing the first enrichment cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Beijerinck |first=Martinus W.| year=1901 |title=Anhaufungsversuche mit Ureumbakterien |journal=Centralblatt f. Bakteriologie, II |volume=7 |issue= |pages=33–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sergei Winogradsky]] also experimented on bacteria using different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Winogradsky |first=Sergei | year=1890 |title=Sur les organismes de la nitrification |journal=Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences |volume=110 |issue= |pages=1013–1016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
High salt concentration will select for [[halophile]]s.  High temperatures will select for [[thermophile]]s.

[[Selenite broth]] is used to selectively isolate [[Salmonella]] species. Alkaline Peptone Water is used for the cultivation of [[vibrio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bd.com/ds/productCenter/297814.asp |title=Product Center: Alkaline Peptone Water (for Vibrio), 8 mL |accessdate= 28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both these examples are clinically relevant for clinical microbiology relating to stool samples.

'''Environment Agency Wales''', (''Asiantaeth yr Amgylchedd Cymru'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]) was, until 31 March 2013, a [[Welsh Government sponsored bodies|Welsh Government Sponsored Body]], while also being part of the [[Environment Agency]] for England and Wales. Its principal aims were to protect and improve the environment in [[Wales]] and to promote [[sustainable development]].

It had an operational area defined along its Eastern boundary by the catchments of the [[River Dee (Wales)|River Dee]] and the [[River Wye]]. Those parts of the [[River Severn]] in Wales were managed by the Environment Agency whilst those parts of the River Dee and River Wye catchments that are in England were nevertheless managed by Environment Agency Wales. The Agency also had a public facing boundary which corresponded to the political boundary of Wales. 

On 1 April 2013 the organisation was merged with the [[Countryside Council for Wales]] and [[Forestry Commission|Forestry Commission Wales]] into a single environmental body, [[Natural Resources Wales]].

== Role and responsibilities ==

Environment Agency Wales' role included: reducing industry’s impacts on the environment, enforcing pollution legislation and reducing the harm caused by flooding and pollution incidents. It also oversaw the management of waste, water resources and freshwater fisheries; cleaning up rivers, coastal waters and contaminated land and improving wildlife habitats.

By influencing others to change attitudes and behaviour, it aimed to make the environment cleaner and healthier for people and wildlife.&lt;ref name="Environment Agency websit - About Us"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment Agency website - About Us|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/aboutus/default.aspx|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Priorities ==

=== Act to reduce climate change and its consequences ===
Environment Agency Wales managed the risk of [[flooding]] from rivers and the sea in Wales. To do this, Environment Agency Wales built, maintained and operated flood defences to protect people and property. It also issued [http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/31618.aspx flood warnings] and works with communities at risk of flooding to help them find appropriate solutions to flood risk through its [https://web.archive.org/web/20120930040854/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/113810.aspx Flood Awareness Wales] programme. When a flood happened, Environment Agency Wales worked with the emergency services and local authorities to minimise the harm to people and damage to property.&lt;ref name="Environment Agency Wales Corporate Plan 2010 - 15"&gt;{{cite web|last=Environment Agency Wales|title=Corporate Plan 2010 - 15|url=http://abetterenvironmentforwales.co.uk/6004_EA_Eng%20index%20page_2.swf|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protect and improve water, land and air ===
Environment Agency Wales was responsible for ensuring that environmental legislation was implemented properly on behalf of the Welsh and UK governments.  This included regulating businesses such as power stations, chemical factories, metal processors, waste management sites, construction industry, food and drink manufacturers, farms and the water industry – to make sure that their work did not damage the environment.  Where people and businesses needed to take water for drinking, industry and irrigation, Environment Agency Wales ensured that they did so without damaging the environment. To do this, Environment Agency Wales gave advice and issued permits, authorisations and consents to businesses that complied with legislative requirements.  When pollution occurred, Environment Agency Wales worked to minimise any environmental damage, identify the source and stop any further pollution. If businesses failed to comply with their permits, and pollution occurred, Environment Agency Wales took enforcement action against them, including prosecution on occasion. Environment Agency Wales also led on dealing with serious waste crime which is often organised, large-scale and profitable. Priority waste crime types include large-scale illegal dumping, illegal waste sites and illegal exports of waste. It also dealt with high risk activities such as illegal disposal of wastes, where there was an actual or imminent threat of significant flooding or pollution.&lt;ref name="Environment Agency Wales Corporate Plan 2010 - 15"/&gt;

=== Work with people and communities to create better places ===
Environment Agency Wales created and improved habitats for fish and other water-based wildlife such as salmon and helped species that were at risk, such as the [[freshwater pearl mussel]]. It also managed licences for fishing and navigation, so that people in Wales – and people visiting Wales – could enjoy the water environment.&lt;ref name="Environment Agency Wales Corporate Plan 2010 - 15"/&gt;

=== Work with businesses and other organisations to use resources wisely ===
Environment Agency Wales licensed water abstractions from groundwater, rivers and lakes to ensure that the needs of people and business were met whilst protecting the environment and wildlife. It also regulated waste management facilities, such as [[Landfill|landfill sites]] or large [[In-vessel composting|composting]] facilities,  to ensure that they did not cause environmental damage and monitored the [[Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme|Landfill Allowances Scheme]] to track how waste is managed in Wales.&lt;ref name="Environment Agency Wales Corporate Plan 2010 - 15"/&gt;

== Accreditation ==

*  For the fourth year running, [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall Cymru]], named Environment Agency Wales as the best place to work in Wales for lesbian, gay and bisexual people in 2012.&lt;ref name="Stonewall Top 100 Employers 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stonewall Top 100 Employers 2012|url=http://www.stonewallcymru.org.uk/cymru/english/at_work/stonewalls_top_100_employers/default.asp|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Environment Agency Wales was accredited to both the [[ISO 14001]] and [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|EMAS]] environmental management standard.&lt;ref name="Environment Agency Awards and Accreditations"&gt;{{cite web|last=Environment Agency|title=Awards and Accreditations|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/aboutus/123002.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a [[Welsh Government Public body]], Environment Agency Wales had to provide its services within the Welsh political boundary (its public facing boundary) in Welsh as well as in English in accordance with the [[Welsh Language Act 1993]].

== Structure ==

Environment Agency Wales had three operational areas, South East Wales, South West Wales and North Wales. Its other departments were Flood and Coastal Risk Management, Corporate Services, Human Resources, Finance and the policy department known as Strategic Unit Wales. All departments reported to the Director of Environment Agency Wales, [[Viscount Mills|Chris Mills]].

=== Senior Management structure ===
Prior to its merger in early 2013:
* [[Vicount Mills|Chris Mills]] - Director, Environment Agency Wales
* Steve Brown - Area Manager, South West Wales
* Ceri Davies - Strategic Unit Manager
* David Edwell - Area Manager, North Wales
* Gareth O’Shea - Area Manager, South East Wales
* Andrew Jervis - Finance Manager (Acting)
* Helen Davies - Human Resources Manager (Acting)
* Graham Hillier - Flood &amp; Coastal Risk Management Manager
* Joanne Sherwood - Corporate Services Manager

== Committees ==
Environment Agency Wales had three statutory committees, each with their own responsibility and each contributing towards making Wales a better place for people and wildlife.&lt;ref name="Environment Agency Wales Committees"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment Agency Wales Committees|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/aboutus/organisation/35613.aspx|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committees were set up by Parliament under the [[Environment Act 1995]]. The committees were made up of external members who were elected to stand on the committee because they had the relevant expertise.

=== Environment Protection Advisory Committee Wales (EPAC) ===

EPAC advised Environment Agency Wales on issues of environmental protection, pollution control, water resources, air quality and waste regulation.

'''Chairman:''' Prof Tom Pritchard

=== Flood Risk Management Wales Committee (FRMW) ===

'''Chairman''': Deep Sagar

=== Fisheries, Ecology and Recreation Advisory Committee (FERAC) ===

FERAC advised Environment Agency Wales on maintaining, improving and developing fisheries as well as recreation, navigation and conservations issues.

'''Chairman:''' Dr Graeme Harris

== Natural Resources Wales ==
On 1 April 2013, Environment Agency Wales, [[Countryside Council for Wales]] and [[Forestry Commission|Forestry Commission Wales]] were merged into [[Natural Resources Wales]], a single body delivering the [[Welsh Government]]'s environmental priorities for Wales.&lt;ref name="A living Wales – a new framework for our environment, our countryside and our seas"&gt;{{cite web|title=A living Wales – a new framework for our environment, our countryside and our seas|url=http://wales.gov.uk/consultations/environmentandcountryside/eshlivingwalescons/?lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WG-SingleBody&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://wales.gov.uk/topics/environmentcountryside/consmanagement/seb/?lang=en  |title=Single Body  |publisher=Welsh Government  |accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3004">The '''European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism''' ('''ESPEN''') is an organization in the field of [[parenteral nutrition|parenteral]] and [[enteral]] nutrition and promotes basic and clinical research, basic and advanced education, organization of consensus statements about clinical care and care quality control.

In 1979 an informal meeting laid the foundations of ESPEN, deciding to create a multidisciplinary society devoted to the study of metabolic problems associated with acute diseases and their nutritional implications and management. ESPEN was formally established in 1980 as the European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition. It later changed its name to the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism. 
 
Congress meetings are held every year in a different European city&lt;ref (ctrl-click)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espen.org/pastcongresses.html |title=The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism |publisher=ESPEN |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gather over 3,000 participants from 82 different countries.&lt;ref&gt;MCI (January 2010). "Book of Congress statistics"&lt;/ref&gt;

A bimonthly journal named ''[[Clinical Nutrition (journal)|Clinical Nutrition]]'', which goes along with ''Clinical Nutrition Supplements'' and an electronic journal ''e-SPEN'' are the society's official publications, published by [[Elsevier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.com/locate/clnu |title=Clinical Nutrition |publisher=Elsevier |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European Parenteral and Enteral National Societies support ESPEN in the form of block members, e.g. the British,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bapen.org.uk/ce_espen.html |title=Joining ESPEN |publisher=Bapen.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; German,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dgem.de/mitgliedsch.htm |title=DGEM - Mitgliedschaft |publisher=Dgem.de |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; French,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfnep.org/component/content/article/101 |title=Devenir membre |publisher=Sfnep.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Austrian societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ake-nutrition.at/ESPEN_MEMBERSHIP.20.0.html |title=Ake-Nutrition: Espen Membership |publisher=Ake-nutrition.at |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the umbrella of ESPEN, many ongoing projects are supported by its members, such as [[NutritionDay]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutritionday.org |title=HOME |publisher=nutritionDay.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Home Artificial Nutrition, and Fight Against Malnutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espen.org/video/VideoPlayer.html |title=VideoPlayer |publisher=Espen.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3762">The '''Freeman law''' is a statement in astronomy which says that [[disk galaxy|disk galaxies]] have the same [[surface brightness]], Σ at the center. It was described in 1970 by [[Ken Freeman (astronomer)|Ken Freeman]].&lt;ref name="McGaugh"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=astro-ph/9505062|last1=McGaugh|first1=S. S|title=Galaxy Selection and the Surface Brightness Distribution|journal=The Astronomical Journal|volume=110|issue=1995|pages=573|last2=Bothun|first2=G. D|last3=Schombert|first3=J. M|year=1995|doi=10.1086/117543|bibcode=1995AJ....110..573M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Freeman, Kenneth C.|title=On the disks of spiral and S0 galaxies|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=160|issue=3|year=1970|pages=811–830|bibcode=1970ApJ...160..811F|doi=10.1086/150474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Freeman law was confirmed in year 2010 for a sample of 30000 [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] galaxy images &lt;ref name="Fathi"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=1009.2692|last1=Fathi|first1=Kambiz|title=Revisiting the Scale Length-mu0 Plane and the Freeman Law in the Local Universe|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=722|pages=L120|year=2010|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/722/1/L120|bibcode=2010ApJ...722L.120F}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it can be used with the [[Tully-Fisher relation]] to determine the [[luminosity]] and therefore distance of an observed galaxy.

However more recently it has been argued that the Freeman law is an effect of [[selection bias]].&lt;ref name="McGaugh" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota State University, "{{cite web |url=http://odin.physastro.mnsu.edu/~eskridge/astr225/week10.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706235131/http://odin.physastro.mnsu.edu/~eskridge/astr225/week10.html |archivedate=2007-07-06 |df= }}"&lt;/ref&gt; The Freeman law is sometimes called the Fish-Freeman effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Disney, M.|author2=Phillipps, S.|year=1983|title=The visibility of galaxies as a function of central surface brightness|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=205|issue=4|pages=1253–1265|doi=10.1093/mnras/205.4.1253|bibcode=1983MNRAS.205.1253D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fish law==
The '''Fish law''' (or Fish's law) in astronomy is the analogue for the Freeman law with disk galaxies replaced by [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical galaxies]]. It was described in 1964 by Robert A. Fish based on photometric results for 29 elliptical galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fish, Robert A.|title=A Mass-Potential Relationship in Elliptical Galaxies and Some Inferences Concerning the Formation and Evolution of Galaxies|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=139|issue=1|year=1964|pages=284–305|bibcode=1964ApJ...139..284F|doi=10.1086/147753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)==
According to Brada and [[Mordehai Milgrom|Milgrom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brada, Rafael|author2=Milgrom, Mordehai|title=The modified dynamics (MOND) predicts an absolute maximum to the acceleration produced by 'dark halos'|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=512|issue=17|pages=L17|date=December 1998|arxiv=astro-ph/9812117|doi=10.1086/311871|bibcode=1999ApJ...512L..17B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{blockquote|The acceleration constant of the modified dynamics ([[MOND]]), ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', appears in various predicted regularities pertinent to galaxies. For example, it features as an upper cutoff to the mean surface density (or mean surface brightness translated with ''[[List of common astronomy symbols#Mass comparison|M]]/[[List of common astronomy symbols#Luminosity comparison|L]]'') of galaxies, as observed and formulated in the Freeman law for disks, and of the Fish law for ellipticals.}}

'''Guillermo Morphy y Ferríz de Guzmán''', best known as '''Conde Morphy''' or '''Count Morphy''' (February 29, 1836 – August 27, 1899 in Madrid) was a Spanish aristocrat, music critic, musicologist, historian, educator, composer and politician. He became personal secretary to King [[Alfonso XII of Spain]] in 1875. He became a highly admired figure in artistic circles of late nineteenth century Madrid, and for his service to the Crown of Spain. He was a friend of [[Isaac Albéniz]], who he arranged a grant for to study at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]]. He served as director of the Royal Concert Society at the [[Teatro Real]] in Madrid until 1891.

==Biography==
Born in Madrid on February 29, 1836, he was of Irish descent, son of Joseph Morphy.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filomusica.com/filo49/bayreuth.html|title=Guillermo Morphy|publisher=Filomusica.com|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his childhood traveling through France, Italy and Germany, among other countries, where he had a European renaissance education becoming a lover of art and literature. He lived for two years in Germany between 1846 and 1848.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2002|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858, he took over his father's law firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qlinks.net/FamilyHistory/d0000/g0000032.html#I582|title=Guillermo MORPHY Y FERRIZ DE GUZMAN (Conde de)|publisher=Qlinks.net|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863 he took classes under the composer [[François-Joseph Fétis]] in Brussels.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1998|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned he entered the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] on November 28, 1863 as a gentleman of the then Prince of Asturias and future King [[Alfonso XII of Spain]], a position he held until the Revolution in 1868 that overthrew [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]].&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt;

He moved to France to engage in musicology, and during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] he traveled to [[Vienna]] to be with Prince Alfonso. There he composed the opera ''Lizzie'' and other orchestral parts.&lt;ref name= "boileau-music.com p. "&gt;{{harvnb|boileau-music.com|2012|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Bourbon Restoration]], he returned to Spain with the King, who appointed him his personal secretary on January 18, 1875 and granted him the title Count Morphy on May 3, 1882.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Ruvigny-Massue-Ruvigny p. 352"&gt;{{harvnb|Ruvigny|Massue|Ruvigny|2000| p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published several studies and translated into Spanish a biography of [[Beethoven]], and in 1892 entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando. He also served as director of the [[Royal Concert Society]] at the [[Teatro Real]] in Madrid until 1891.

Morphy was also an acquaintance and benefactor of several notable musicians of the time, such as [[Tomás Bretón]], [[Pablo Casals]] and [[Isaac Albéniz]].&lt;ref name= "boileau-music.com p. "/&gt; The count was a close friend of Albéniz in particular and was highly enthusiastic towards his talent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/AM005albeniz.htm|title=Albéniz|publisher=Gaudiallgaudi.com|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was Morphy who arranged for a grant for him to study at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]].&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt; Morphy also arranged for violinist [[Enrique Fernández Arbós]] to study under [[Henri Vieuxtemps]] in Brussels.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt; Albéniz dedicated his composition ''[[Sevilla (Albéniz)|Sevilla]]'' to Count Morphy's wife when he premiered in a piano performance in Paris on January 24, 1886.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 69"&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2002|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In late 1883, a number of musicians, led by Count Morphy, sharing the same concerns regarding the regeneration of Spanish art, gathered together in a society in Madrid to found the Philharmonic Institute with the aim of offering musical training at the same level as other European centres. The regenerative nature of their educational project, compared to the teachings of the Conservatory of Madrid, is highlighted. In particular, the bel canto school run by Napoleón Verger helped to improve the standard of singing in Spain and to endow opera stages with renowned figures, thus paving the way for the establishment of Spanish lyric drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=García Álvarez de la Villa |first1=Beatriz |title=El Instituto Filarmónico |journal=Cuadernos de Música Iberoamericana |date=2016 |volume=29 |pages=81–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1886 to 1895, the Count of Morphy assumed a leading role as president of the Fine Arts section, he engaged with the activities of the society by giving lectures and by introducing the Ateneo to his own aesthetic principles, including his regenerationist agenda and his musical nationalism. He also extended invitations to some of the most relevant international figures and to a young generation of Spanish artists, with the intention of bringing the public closer to the European cultural scene. The Ateneo experienced a period of splendor with a new impulse in vocal, instrumental and chamber music, and a renewed repertoire with contemporary works by Spanish and Central European composers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=García Álvarez de la Villa |first1=Beatriz |title=Regeneracionismo musical en el Ateneo de Madrid bajo la presidencia del Conde de Morphy (1886-1895) |journal=Revista de Musicología |volume=40 |date=2017 |issue=vol.

== AIDS ==

The [[HIV]] genome is made from [[RNA]] rather than [[DNA]]. The [[enzyme]] that converts RNA to DNA and then inserts it into a cell makes between one and 10 mistakes every time it copies itself. This high error rate means that the [[virus]] population that inhabits each HIV patients is genetically diverse.&lt;ref name=rd/&gt;

When the HIV virus infects someone, it copies its DNA and inserts into the DNA of [[white blood cells]], making the virus part of its host. Even if these genes could be silenced with drugs, (later) stopping the drugs sets the viral DNA free to attack the patient.&lt;ref name=rd/&gt;

HT-TALENs binds to that sequence and cuts the HIV DNA, but not human DNA. When that cut gets fixed by the cell's [[DNA repair]] system, it makes a scar that leaves the virus unable to return and make HIV DNA cells. 60% of the cells making the protein damage the viral DNA.&lt;ref name=rd/&gt;

{{lead too short|date=May 2014}}
This is a [[comparative religion]] article which outlines the similarities and interactions between [[Hermeticism]] (or [[Hermeticism|Hermetism]]) and other  religions or philosophies.

== Christianity ==
[[File:Seven governors.jpg|left|175px|thumb|A work by [[Jakob Böhme]] illustrating a Christian take on Hermetic astrology, 1682]]
Christianity and Hermetism have interacted in such a way that controversy surrounds the nature of the influence.  Some, such as [[Richard August Reitzenstein]] believed that Hermetism had heavily influenced Christianity; while others, such as [[Marie-Joseph LaGrange]], believed that Christianity heavily influenced Hermetism; most see the exchange as more mutual.&lt;ref name="Lyman"&gt;(Lyman p. 265)&lt;/ref&gt;   Both religions hold [[redemption (religious)|redemption]], [[revelation]] and focus on the knowledge of God as the meaning of [[World population|humanity]]'s existence.  This knowledge of God comes upon a mystical experience dependent upon rebirth, the focal point of arguments for influence from one of these religions upon the other.&lt;ref name="Lyman_a"&gt;(Lyman p. 268)&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus of this rebirth are the words "Life," "Light," and "Truth" as well as a moral attitude of the seeker in his attainment of higher knowledge.  Both also share a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic philosophy]] which comes from a shared philosophical background in popular schools of [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic]] thought.&lt;ref name="Lyman_b"&gt;(Lyman p. 269)&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Christianity and Hermetism both are [[esotericism|esoteric]] without having an excessive emphasis on secrecy, relying upon inward experience, assisted by instruction and ultimately the result of revelation by God.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 271)&lt;/ref&gt;  Former president of the [[American Academy of Religion]], Catherine L Albanese, has theorized that Hermetic thought has had a profound influence in [[Mormonism]], [[Unitarianism]], [[Universalism]], and the [[Shakers]].&lt;ref name="Neuhaus"&gt;(Neuhaus)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century'', Lutheran Bishop James Heiser evaluated the writings of [[Marsilio Ficino]] and [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] as contributions to a “Hermetic Reformation."&lt;ref&gt;Heiser, James D., Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century, Repristination Press, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-4610-9382-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Fourth Gospel ===
The ''[[Fourth Gospel]]'', or ''Gospel of John'', is purported to have similarities with the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'' in religious thought and religious questing.&lt;ref name="Lyman" /&gt;  There are also, however, deep differences as well.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 266)&lt;/ref&gt;

Both texts utilize the concept of [[Logos]]&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 270)&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasize that the followers of their respective religions are apart from the rest of the world, suitable for only a few followers.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman pp. 270-71)&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the two texts stress the importance of redemption, revelation, and rebirth to find knowledge of God&lt;ref name="Lyman_a" /&gt; and contain striking similarity in the wording of how moral attitudes promote higher knowledge in general.&lt;ref name="Lyman_b" /&gt;  Opposed to the basis of the contemporary [[mystery cult]]s, both texts relayed that the core of religious practice should be done internally through the personal experience of the believer rather than externally through [[sacrament]]al ritual.&lt;ref name="Lyman_c"&gt;(Lyman p. 272)&lt;/ref&gt; Dualism plays a strong part in each of the two works.&lt;ref name="Lyman_b" /&gt;

Mary Lyman also points out four distinct contrasts between the two works despite their similarities. First, that the ''Fourth Gospel'' is a homogeneous work while the ''Corpus Hermeticum'' is a work which is found in fragments which she suspects were written by many authors over a wide range of time.&lt;ref name="Lyman_c" /&gt;  Second, cosmic speculation is paramount to the Hermetic work while the fourth Gospel focuses on issues of religion.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman pp. 273-74)&lt;/ref&gt;  Third, the Hermetic text focuses on the [[asceticism]] of the day while the Fourth Gospel ignores it completely.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman pp. 274-75)&lt;/ref&gt;  Fourth, the Gospel's figures are all unique and grounds itself in the life of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] while the Hermetic text uses an "elusive literary tradition" which does little to identify or separate its characters.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 275)&lt;/ref&gt;  Though she relays that a scholar named Angus believed that the two would be more similar if they had the same proportion of Hermetic writings as Christian writings.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 273)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rosicrucian Concept of the Tree of Pansophia.jpg|left|175 px|thumb|A 17th century depiction of the [[Rosicrucian]] concept of the Tree of [[Pansophia]].]]

=== Mormonism ===
A theory by [[John L. Brooke]], an author and professor at [[Tufts University]], suggests that [[Mormonism]] has its roots in Hermetism and Hermeticism after following a philosophical trail from Renaissance [[Europe]].  The early Mormons, most notably [[Joseph Smith]], were linked with magic, [[alchemy]], [[Freemasonry]], [[divination|divining]] and "other elements of radical religion" prior to Mormonism.  Brooke attests correlations with the view that spirit and matter are one and the same, the covenant of [[celestial marriage]], and the ability of humanity to become deified or ultimately perfect.&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;(Barlow)&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, Brooke argues that Mormonism can only be understood in conjunction with the occult and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]-era sectarian idea of [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restoration]].  He sees ties to Hermeticism in Mormon support for [[Pelagianism]], [[communitarianism]], [[polygamy]] and [[Dispensationalism]].  He does however digress that there was a change since the 1860s in the [[LDS Church]] which has widely removed Hermetic influence.&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt;  Catherine L Albanese picked up on Brooke's work and further claims that Smith's heavenly realm is derived from [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s Divine Man and Hermeticism in general, linking it in with several [[United States|American]] Christian movements which move Christianity in odd directions.&lt;ref name="Neuhaus" /&gt;

However, scholars at the LDS-owned [[Brigham Young University]] have denounced Brooke's work and even scolded the publisher, [[Cambridge University Press]], for printing it{{verification needed|date=March 2015}}.  Philip I Barlow criticizes the work as carelessly seeking out relations to Hermeticism which Brooke knows better than Mormonism, and believes that Brooke's links to Hermeticism can be explained away with "a particular and selectively literal reading of the Bible."&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt;  Albanese was criticised by Richard J Neuhaus as having denied Christianity the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] in order to minimize its influence and that she is avoiding [[theology]] by calling her book a [[cultural history]].  Albanese believes that the metaphysical denial in scholarly research is due to its strong [[feminism|feminist]] qualities.  Neuhaus believes American Christianity is more Gnostic in nature than Hermetic.&lt;ref name="Neuhaus" /&gt;

=== Miscellaneous ===
Albanese portends that several Christian denominations were affected by Hermeticism.  The Shakers had been influenced in their belief of a dual God, being both male and female: Heavenly Father and Holy Mother Wisdom.  She claims that Universalism was a clear mix of Christianity and Hermeticism where they come together, much like Rosicrucianism.&lt;ref name="Neuhaus" /&gt;

== Gnosticism ==
Hermeticism is closely related to [[Gnosticism]].&lt;ref name="Hoeller"&gt;Stephan A. Hoeller, [http://www.gnosis.org/hermes.htm ''On the Trail of the Winged God. Hermes and Hermeticism Throughout the Ages'']&lt;/ref&gt; Both flourished in the same period in [[Alexandria]], in the same spiritual climate,&lt;ref name="Hoeller" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times p. 17)&lt;/ref&gt; sharing the goal of the soul escaping from the material realm through true understanding, and emphasizing personal knowledge of God.&lt;ref name="Hoeller" /&gt; Both were part of the third pillar of Western culture; representing the balance between [[Greek culture|Greek]] [[rationality]] and [[Bible|biblical faith]] along with the [[Cathar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek and Hanegraaff p. vii)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both groups saw the fundamental relationship between God and man was found through [[gnosis]] in a goal to "see" God and in some instances become one with God.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Gnostics, however, felt that there was something seriously wrong with ''[[The All#Nous|Nous]]'', a part of The All;&lt;ref&gt;(Horgan p. 41)&lt;/ref&gt; to them, it seemed that the concept could be stretched so far as to say that by bringing the world into existence, God had to remove himself from it at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;(Horgan pp. 39-40)&lt;/ref&gt;  They also differed on the basis of [[theology]], [[cosmology]], and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from ''Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times'', p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;  Though both agreed in God's transcendence over the Universe, Hermetists believed that God could still be comprehended through philosophical reasoning, in agreement with philosophers and Christian theologians, but Gnostics felt God was completely unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Gnostics indulged in [[mythology|mythological]] references often, Hermetic texts are generally void of mythology,&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[Poimandres]]'' as an exception.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times pp. 12-13)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hermetism is optimistic about God, while many forms of Christian Gnosticism are pessimistic about [[demiurge|the creator]] (a different being from [[monad (Gnosticism)|their conception of God]]):&lt;ref name="Hoeller" /&gt; Several Christian Gnostic sects saw the [[Cosmos]] were the product of an evil creator and thus evil itself, while Hermetists saw the Cosmos as a beautiful creation in the image of God.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times pp. 9-10)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both view that mankind was originally divine and has become entrapped in the material world, a slave to passion and distracted from divine nature.  However, the Gnostics often held a pessimistic view of mankind as a result while the Hermetic belief is generally positive towards mankind just the same.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times pp. 11-12)&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather, Hermetists believed that the human body was not bad in itself, but materialistic impulses such as [[Sexual attraction|sexual desire]] were the cause of ''evil'' in the world.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times pp. 16-17)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islam ==
In 830 CE, a group of Hermetic pagans in [[Harran]] needed protection by being either Muslim, Christian, Jewish, or [[Sabians|Sabian]].  They took the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] as their scripture and [[Hermes Trismegistus]] as their prophet, and decided to call themselves Sabians.  As no one was sure what the [[Qur'an]] meant by Sabian, they were accepted as being such having a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[scripture]] and a [[prophet]].  This group played a large role in Baghdad's intellectual life from 856-1050.&lt;ref&gt;(Churton pp. 26-27)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous of the Harranian Sabians was [[Thabit ibn Qurra]], who made great advances in [[alchemy]], [[astronomy]], and [[mathematics]], citing his paganism as the reason for his ability.&lt;ref&gt;(Churton pp. 27-28)&lt;/ref&gt; The author Antoine Faivre theorizes that Hermes Trismegistus is mentioned in the Qu'ran as well, under the name of [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]].  ([http://www.submission.info/servlet/qtbrowse?pickthall=true&amp;yusufali=true&amp;shakir=true&amp;arabic=true&amp;chapter=19&amp;verseBegin=56&amp;verseEnd=56 19:56], [http://www.submission.info/servlet/qtbrowse?pickthall=true&amp;yusufali=true&amp;shakir=true&amp;arabic=true&amp;chapter=19&amp;verseBegin=57&amp;verseEnd=57 19:57]) Idris is also identified with Enoch,&lt;ref name="Faivre"&gt;(Faivre 1995 pp.19-20)&lt;/ref&gt; who is also identified with Hermes.&lt;ref&gt;(Hall The Secret Teachings of All Ages p. 94)&lt;/ref&gt;  He is called "Thrice Wise," relating to Hermes' title "Thrice Great."&lt;ref name="Faivre" /&gt;

[[Khalid ibn Yazid]] was an [[Umayyad]] prince, who took an interest in alchemy early in Islamic history. The works of [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]] would be heavily influenced by Hermetic philosophy, as would [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] beliefs and theology.

== Judaism ==
The relationship between [[Judaism]] and Hermetism has been one of mutual influence and a subject of controversy within the Jewish religion.&lt;ref name="Lelli"&gt;(Lelli)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages ===

[[File:Complex qaballah.jpg|left|175px|thumb|A complex array of Qaballah [[Sephiroth (Kabbalah)|Sephiroth]] by [[Christian Knorr von Rosenroth]], 1684]]

This identification paved the way for the exchange and melding of ideas between Judaism and Hermetism during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;  The most prominent interrelation between the two systems is in the development of [[Kabbalah]] which developed into three separate brands: a [[Jewish Kabbalah|Jewish]] stream, a [[Christian Kabbalah|Christian]] stream (''[[Kabbalah|Cabala]]'' in Christianity), and a [[Hermetic Kabbalah|Hermetic]] stream (''[[Qabalah]]'' in Hermeticism).&lt;ref name="Leslie"&gt;(Leslie)&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval Hermetism, aside from [[alchemy]], is often seen as analogous to and was heavily influenced by these Kabbalistic ideas.&lt;ref name="Leslie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Regardie p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermetism and Kabbalah arose together in the 12th and 13th centuries.  The [[Practical Kabbalah]] also relied upon magic and astrology but focused more on the Hebrew language in its incantations than the general language of Hermetism in general.&lt;ref&gt;(Wieczynski p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, Jewish scholars of the Middle Ages attempted to make use of treatises on [[astrology]], [[medicine]] and [[theurgy]] as a justification for practicing natural magic forbidden by a number of commandments in the [[Torah]] and reinforced by prophetic books codified by [[rabbi]]nic authorities.  They noted the wonders performed by celebrated biblical figures such as the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]] and King Solomon and which were seen as a God-given and condoned use of natural magic.  They attributed these arts to divine knowledge imparted by Jewish heroes to [[gentiles]] such as the [[India]]ns, [[Babylon]]ians, [[Egypt]]ians, and [[Greece|Greeks]], and felt that by approaching [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] from a religious standpoint would legitimize their use of the sciences.  In particular, they believed the Hermetic teachings to have its origins in ancient Jewish sources.&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

These Jewish scholars, particularly the ones who distrusted [[Term logic|Aristotelian rationality]], looked to Hermetism as a backing to discuss theological interpretation of the [[Torah]] and the [[ten commandments]].  Fabrizo Lelli writes: "As for Christians and Muslims, so likewise for Jews, Hermetism was an alternative to Aristotelianism--the likeliest prospect, in fact, for integrating an alien system into their religion.  This was because the response of the [[Hermetica]] to intellectual problems was generally [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|theosophical]]."&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

In the use of these Hermetic treatises, these Jewish scholars, though at times inadvertently, introduced Hermetic ideas into Jewish thought.  [[Shabbetay Donnolo]]'s 10th century commentary on the ''[[Sefer Yezirah]]'' shows Hermetic influence, as well as the 13th century texts later compiled into the ''[[Sefer ha-Zohar]]'', and in the contemporary Kabbalistic works of [[Abraham Abulafia]] as well as of other Jewish thinkers influenced by Kabbalah&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt; such as [[Isaac Abravanel]] who used Hermetic Qabalah to affirm the superiority of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;(Skalli)&lt;/ref&gt;  Lelli suggests that it was natural for these Jewish Kabbalists to elevate Hermetic teachings to a major role in Jewish thought in a time when they began to produce their own "antirationalist--exegesis of scripture."  This was despite the fact that many Hermetic works were ascribed to [[Aristotle]] in the time through [[pseudepigrapha]]; these scholars saw that as a justification to give the same elevated authority to the medical, astronomical, and magical Hermetic texts.&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

However, most Medieval Jewish scholars aware of the Hermetic tradition did not mention Hermetism explicitly, but rather referred to them through Hermetic ideas that were borrowed from Islam or brought Hermeticism up only to reject it.  While scholars such as [[Moses ibn Ezra]], [[Bahya ibn Paquda]], [[Judah ha-Levi]], and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] specifically brought up Hermeticism to integrate into their philosophies, others such as [[Moses ben Maimon]] (Maimonides) specifically rejected anything Hermetic as being responsible for counterparadigmic views of God.  Maimonides warned his readers against what he viewed as the degenerative effect of Hermetic ideas, particularly those of the Sabians, and was effective in persuading many Jewish thinkers away from Hermetic integration, known as Hebrew Hermetism.&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

Scholars, such as Abraham ibn Ezra, felt justified in invoking the authority of Hermes to offer esoteric explanations of Jewish ritual.  This culminated in a wide use of Hermetic texts for the use of theurgy and [[Amulet|talisman]] construction.  The Jewish version of the theurgic practice of drawing divine spirits down to Earth was horadat haruhaniyut, "the lowering of spirituality."  Books such as the ''[[Sefer Mafteah Shlomoh]]'', ''[[Sefer Meleket Muskelet]]'', ''[[Sefer ha-Tamar]]'' and ''[[Sefer Hermes]]''.  The Hermetic texts most valued by Jewish scholars were those which dealt with astrology, medicine, and astral magic; however shunned by Maimonides as dangerous and destructive.&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

=== Renaissance ===
[[File:Rabbi Abraham Eleazar.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Rabbi Abraham Eleazar demonstrating the alchemical process of distillation through symbolism, 1760]]
Despite Maimonides' denunciation of Hermetism, Jewish scholars in the Renaissance struggled to reconcile his beliefs with those of the proponents of Hermetic thought within Judaism.  Renaissance scholars argued that the rationalism of Maimonides drew upon the [[prisca sapienta]] that had both Mosaic and Hermetic origins and that Abraham ibn Ezra's Commentary on the Pentateuch was evidence that they shared the same views on the relationship between [[religion]] and [[science]].&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

However, scholars such as [[Averroist Elijah del Medigo]] carried on Maimonides' crusade.  Medigo claimed that the theurgic practices of Hermetism were against the teachings of the Torah.  Others, such as [[Yohanan Alemanno]], claimed that the Hermetic teachings were part of a primordial wisdom of the ancients and put the writings of Hermes as being equal to those of King Solomon.  Hermetism was also prominent in the works of [[David Messer Leon]], [[Isaac Abravanel]], [[Judah Abravanel]], [[Elijah Hayyim]], [[Abraham Farissol]], [[Judah Moscato]] and [[Abraham Yagel]].&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

The works of [[Baruch Spinoza]] have also been ascribed a Hermetic element&lt;ref&gt;(Weststeijn)&lt;/ref&gt; and Hermetic influenced thinkers such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] have accepted Spinoza's version of God.&lt;ref&gt;(Lange)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient philosophy ==
Hermetism had a strong philosophical influence,&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from ''Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times'' p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt; especially from [[Stoicism]] and [[Platonism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from ''Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times'' p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Occult ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2008}}
Much of the Western Esoteric tradition is based on a blend of Hermeticism and the ''[[Kabbalah Ma'asit]]'', so called magical or [[practical Kabbalah]]. Occultism uses the Hermetic and Kabbalistic theory of creation and angelic/demonic forces, as a basis for ritual magic, and theurgy. Most magic theory involves the manipulation of [[Yetzirah]], the world of Formation, and letting the effect trickle down to the physical universe (in accordance to the Hermetic concept of "as above, so below"). This includes the communication and manipulation of inhabitants of Yetzirah, angelic or demonic forces. The spelling of "Qabalah", is generally referred to as the [[Hermetic Qabalah]], often having a magical or occult slant. While "Kabbalah" refers to the traditional [[Jewish Kabbalah|Jewish branch]].

These beliefs were influential in [[Europe]]an occult lore, especially from the Renaissance forward.  During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, magicians wrote grimoires which show a major influence from both Hermeticism and Kabbalah and have since become a basis for most practical occultism. In more recent times, magical orders such as The Golden Dawn have revived and revised these traditions.

== Transcendentalism ==
Catherine L Albanese theorized that [[Transcendentalism]] has Hermetic influence.  Among Transcendentalist thinkers, she especially points to [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] who has ideas of humankind transcending into deification similar to those of Joseph Smith.  She also points to the [[spiritual narcissism]] of [[Henry David Thoreau]].&lt;ref name="Neuhaus" /&gt;

== Neopaganism ==
[[Neopaganism]] is directly related to Hermeticism. The [[Renaissance]] Hermetists [[Plethon]] and [[Ficino]] are the foundation of the [[Western Mystery Tradition]] from which contemporary Neopaganism arose. [[Wicca]], one of the earliest and most famous of the Neopagan religions, honours a Goddess and a God, who are seen by some as being aspects of a single greater deity. See [[Wiccan views of divinity]]. [[Silver Ravenwolf]] expresses this in terms of the [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalistic]] [[Tree of Life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]:

:"Down we go then, to the first two branches of the tree, right below the All. Each branch is exactly the same, one on the right side of the tree and one on the left.  Totally balanced in every respect to each other.  They represent the [[Horned God|God]] and the [[Goddess#Wicca and Neopaganism|Goddess]], or the Lord and the Lady.  Separate yet equal, together they combine into the essence of the All."&lt;ref&gt;(Ravenwolf p. 44)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravenwolf holds that the God and Goddess are merely the masculine and feminine aspects of The All, and that both in turn express themselves through sub-aspects as the gods and goddesses of the various pantheons,&lt;ref&gt;(Ravenwolf p. 45)&lt;/ref&gt; just as in Hermeticism archangels, angels, and demons are all seen as embodying aspects of God.

The Hermetic use of signs, herbs, stones and animal imagery as a means for drawing down the planetary powers into such signs&lt;ref&gt;(Yates ''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition'' p. 45)&lt;/ref&gt; is mirrored in the [[sympathetic magic]] practices of Neopagan [[witchcraft]].

Amongst pagan [[white supremacist]] groups, the [[Odinist]] [[White Order of Thule]] integrates Hermetic philosophy into its indoctrination process.&lt;ref&gt;(Vysotsky)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zoroastrianism ==
[[Zoroastrianism]] plays a large role in influencing Hermeticism.  In 525 BCE, Egypt was conquered by the [[Persian Empire]], bringing Zoroastrian ideas along with it.&lt;ref&gt;(Abel &amp; Hare p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt;  In obscure texts, Hermes claims to look to [[Zoroaster]] as a spiritual father, having learned much of the [[zodiac]] from him.  It is further said that Zoroaster had penetrated the mystery of the zodiac more than any other.&lt;ref&gt;(Powell pp. 15-16)&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, it has been suggested that Zoroaster (like so many others) and Hermes are one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;(Hall ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages'' p. 516)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is possible that this was from a faked Zoroastrian text.  Theurgy is often called Zoroastrian Magic as well.&lt;ref&gt;(Garstin pp. 9-10)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gallee.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow]]: "''Forsachistu diobolae..''" (Forsake devils) and "''gelobistu in got alamehtigan fadaer''" (believe in god almighty father). Left caption in a later writing: "''Abrinuciatio diaboli lingua Teotisca veter''." = (abjuration of the devil in Old German). Under the Baptismal Vow in Latin an enumeration of the first 20 practices in the Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum.]]

The '''''Indiculus superstitionum et paganiarum''''' (''Small index of superstitions and paganism'') is a [[Latin]] collection of [[Capitulary|capitularies]] identifying and condemning superstitious and pagan beliefs found in the north of [[Gaul]]&lt;ref name=dierkens24&gt;Dierkens 24.&lt;/ref&gt; and among the [[Saxon]]s during the time of their subjugation and conversion by [[Charlemagne]].

From the original manuscript only the cover remains, which lists thirty chapters. The manuscript is held in the [[Vatican Library]] in a collection (''Codex Palatinus Latinus'' 577) which probably originates from [[Fulda]] and thence traveled to [[Mainz]], arriving there in 1479. From Mainz it went to the [[Bibliotheca Palatina]] in [[Heidelberg]], and arrived in Rome at the latest in 1623. Preceding the ''Indiculus'' is the so-called [[Old Saxon Baptismal Vow]]. The text is edited in the ''Karlomanni Principis Capitulare'', published by the [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]].

==Date==
''Codex Palatinus Latinus'' 577 itself appears to have been copied ca. 800 in either Fulda or [[Mainz]]. Alain Dierkens argues, on the basis of word choice (the correspondence between the phrase ''superstitionem et paganiarum'' and the diction used by Boniface in his 742&lt;ref&gt;Tangl, letter 50, 80ff.&lt;/ref&gt; letter to [[Pope Zachary]]) and a comparison between the content of the ''Indiculus'' and the conclusions of the [[Concilium Germanicum]] (744), that the ''Indiculus'' was indeed appended to or pertained to the decisions made at the Concilium Germanicum and the two consequent Frankish synods at Estinnes and Soissons.&lt;ref&gt;Dierkens 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, they were not the product of a late-seventh century scribe at Fulda, nor were the prohibitions aimed specifically or exclusively at the Saxons.&lt;ref name=dierkens24/&gt;

==Significance==
The index provides valuable insight into the religious culture of the pagan Saxons (from the Christian point of view) and into the daily practices of Christian missionaries working in that area. Since it is more or less contemporary with the activities of [[Saint Boniface]] in modern-day Germany, he has been called a "guiding influence" on its compilation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qh1lrIM5nd4C&amp;pg=PA173 Filotas 173.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Alain Dierkens, the ''Indiculus'', which he thinks derives from the "entourage" of Boniface, evidences the ongoing practice of pre-Christian practices, including divination, the use of amulets, magic, and witchcraft, and suggests that the church allowed or transformed certain practices which it had been unable to extirpate.&lt;ref&gt;Dierkens 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
{{Physical cosmology}}
In [[physical cosmology]] the '''inflationary epoch''' was the period in the evolution of the early [[universe]] when, according to [[inflation theory]], the universe underwent an extremely rapid exponential [[metric expansion of space|expansion]]. This rapid expansion increased the linear dimensions of the early universe by a factor of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; (and possibly a much larger factor), and so increased its volume by a factor of at least 10&lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt;. Expansion by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt; is equivalent to expanding an object 1 [[nanometer]] (10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; [[Meter|m]], about half the width of a [[molecule]] of [[DNA]]) in length to one approximately 10.6 [[light years]] (about 62 trillion miles) long.

The expansion is thought to have been triggered by the [[phase transition]] that marked the end of the preceding [[grand unification epoch]] at approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang]]. One of the theoretical products of this phase transition was a [[scalar field]] called the [[inflaton]] field. As this field settled into its lowest energy state throughout the universe, it generated a repulsive force that led to a rapid expansion of space. This expansion explains various properties of the current universe that are difficult to account for without such an inflationary epoch.

It is not known exactly when the inflationary epoch ended, but it is thought to have been between 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang. The rapid expansion of space meant that elementary particles remaining from the grand unification epoch were now distributed very thinly across the universe. However, the huge potential energy of the inflaton field was released at the end of the inflationary epoch, repopulating the universe with a dense, hot mixture of [[quark–gluon plasma|quarks, anti-quarks and gluons]] as it entered the [[electroweak epoch]].

On 17 March 2014, astrophysicists of the [[BICEP and Keck Array|BICEP2]] collaboration announced the detection of inflationary [[gravitational waves]] in the [[B-modes|B-mode]] [[power spectrum]], providing the first clear experimental evidence for [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmological inflation]] and the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref name="BICEP2-2014"&gt;{{cite web |authors=Staff |title=BICEP2 2014 Results Release |url=http://bicepkeck.org |date=17 March 2014 |work=[[National Science Foundation]] |accessdate=18 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20140317"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clavin |first=Whitney |title=NASA Technology Views Birth of the universe |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-082 |date=17 March 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20140317"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |authorlink=Dennis Overbye |title=Detection of Waves in Space Buttresses Landmark Theory of Big Bang |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html |date=17 March 2014 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=17 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=BICEP2 I: Detection of ''B''-mode Polarization at Degree Angular Scales|first1=P.

{{Infobox Observatory}}
The '''Jodrell Bank Observatory''' (originally the '''Jodrell Bank Experimental Station''' and from 1966 to 1999, the '''Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories'''; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɒ|d|r|əl}}) hosts a number of [[radio telescope]]s, and is part of the [[Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics]] at the [[University of Manchester]]. The [[observatory]] was established in 1945 by [[Bernard Lovell]], a radio astronomer at the University of Manchester to investigate [[cosmic ray]]s after his work on [[radar]] during the Second World War. It has since played an important role in the research of [[meteor]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[astrophysical maser|masers]] and [[gravitational lens]]es, and was heavily involved with the tracking of [[space probe]]s at the start of the [[Space Age]]. The managing director of the observatory is Professor Simon Garrington.

The main telescope at the observatory is the [[Lovell Telescope]], which is the third largest steerable radio telescope in the world. There are three other active telescopes at the observatory; the [[Mark II (radio telescope)|Mark II]], and {{convert|42|ft|m|abbr=on}} and 7&amp;nbsp;m diameter radio telescopes. Jodrell Bank Observatory is the base of the [[MERLIN|Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network]] (MERLIN), a National Facility run by the [[University of Manchester]] on behalf of the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]].

The observatory, the Jodrell Bank Visitor Centre and an arboretum, are in the [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] of [[Lower Withington]] and the rest of the site is in Goostrey civil parish, near [[Goostrey]] and [[Holmes Chapel]], [[Cheshire East|Cheshire]], [[North West England]]. The observatory is reached from the [[A535 road|A535]]. The [[Crewe to Manchester Line]] passes right by the site, and [[Goostrey railway station|Goostrey station]] is a short distance away. In 2018, the observatory became a candidate for [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage site]] status.

== Early years ==
[[Image:Jodrell bank Hut 1945.jpg|thumb|Observations at Jodrell Bank in 1945]]
{{see also|Timeline of Jodrell Bank Observatory}}
Jodrell Bank was first used for academic purposes in 1939 when the University of Manchester's [[Faculty of Life Sciences (University of Manchester)#Department of Botany|Department of Botany]] purchased three fields from the Leighs. It is named from a nearby rise in the ground, Jodrell Bank, which was named after [[William Jauderell]] whose descendants lived at the [[mansion]] that is now Terra Nova School. The site was extended in 1952 by the purchase of a farm from George Massey on which the [[Lovell Telescope]] was built.&lt;ref name="story_jb"&gt;Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank''&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was first used for [[astrophysics]] in 1945, when Bernard Lovell used some equipment left over from [[World War II]], including a [[gun laying]] [[radar]], to investigate [[cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref name="story_2"&gt;Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment was a GL II radar system working at a wavelength of 4.2&amp;nbsp;m, provided by [[J. S. Hey]].&lt;ref name="astronomer_110"&gt;Astronomer by Chance, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2005Gunn"&gt;Gunn, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; He intended to use the equipment in [[Manchester]] but [[Electromagnetic interference|electrical interference]] from the trams on [[Oxford Road, Manchester|Oxford Road]] prevented him from doing so. He moved the equipment to Jodrell Bank, {{convert|25|mi|km}} south of the city, on 10 December 1945.&lt;ref name="2005Gunn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="story_3"&gt;Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Lovell's main research was transient radio echoes, which he confirmed were from [[ionisation|ionized]] meteor trails by October 1946.&lt;ref name="story_9"&gt;Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The first staff were Alf Dean and Frank Foden who observed meteors observed with the naked eye while Lovell observed the electromagnetic signal using equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bernard Lovell |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21560524 |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=18 August 2012 |accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first time Lovell turned the radar on  – 14 December 1945 – the [[Geminids]] [[meteor shower]] was at a maximum.&lt;ref name="story_3"/&gt;

Over the next few years, Lovell accumulated more ex-military radio hardware, including a portable cabin, known as a "Park Royal" in the military (see [[Park Royal Vehicles]]). The first permanent building was near to the cabin and was named after it.&lt;ref name="story_9"/&gt;

Jodrell Bank is primarily used for investigating radio waves from the planets and stars.

== Searchlight telescope ==
A [[searchlight]] was loaned to Jodrell Bank in 1946 by the army;&lt;ref name="story_10"&gt;Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; a broadside array was constructed on its mount by [[J. Clegg]].&lt;ref name="story_10"/&gt; It consisted of a number of [[Yagi antenna]]s.&lt;ref name="astronomer_129"&gt;Astronomer by Chance, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for astronomical observations in October 1946.&lt;ref name="astronomer_128"&gt;Astronomer by Chance, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 and 10 October 1946, the telescope observed [[ionisation]] in the atmosphere caused by meteors in the [[Giacobinids]] meteor shower. When the antenna was turned by 90 degrees at the maximum of the shower, the number of detections dropped to the background level, proving that the transient signals detected by radar were from meteors.&lt;ref name="astronomer_129"/&gt; The telescope was then used to determine the radiant points for meteors. This was possible as the echo rate is at a minimum at the radiant point, and a maximum at 90 degrees to it.&lt;ref name="story_10"/&gt; The telescope and other receivers on the site, studied [[Aurora (astronomy)|auroral streamer]]s that were visible in early August 1947.&lt;ref name="story_15"&gt;Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="astronomer_186"&gt;Astronomer by Chance, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transit Telescope ==
&lt;!-- [[:fr:Télescope Transit]] --&gt;
The Transit Telescope was a {{convert|218|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[parabolic reflector]] [[zenith telescope]] built in 1947. At the time, it was the world's largest [[radio telescope]]. It consisted of a wire mesh suspended from a ring of {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[scaffolding|scaffold poles]], which focussed radio signals on a [[focus (optics)|focal point]] {{convert|126|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the ground. The telescope mainly looked directly upwards, but the direction of the beam could be changed by small amounts by tilting the mast to change the position of the focal point. The focal mast was changed from timber to steel before construction was complete.&lt;ref name="story_jb"/&gt;

The telescope was replaced by the steerable {{convert|250|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[Lovell Telescope]] and the [[Mark II (radio telescope)|Mark II]] telescope was subsequently built at the same location.

The telescope could map a ± 15-degree strip around the zenith at 72 and 160&amp;nbsp;MHz, with a resolution at 160&amp;nbsp;MHz of 1 degree.&lt;ref name="bluebook"&gt;{{cite book | first=Bernard | last=Lovell | authorlink=Bernard Lovell | title=Blue Book | date=1950 | url=http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/lovell/bluebook/ | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114004039/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/lovell/bluebook/ | archivedate=14 January 2010 | df=dmy-all }} (the proposal document for the Lovell Telescope). pp. 4–5&lt;/ref&gt; It discovered radio noise from the [[Andromeda Galaxy|Great Nebula]] in [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]—the first definite detection of an extragalactic radio source—and the remains of [[Tycho's Supernova]] in the radio frequency; at the time it had not been discovered by [[optical astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/history/early.html | title=The Early History | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2006-11-22 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027221016/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/history/early.html | archivedate=27 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, the telescope tracked various space probes. Between 11 March and 12 June 1960, it tracked the United States' [[NASA]]-launched [[Pioneer 5]] probe. The telescope sent commands to the probe, including those to separate it from its carrier rocket and turn on its more powerful transmitter when the probe was eight million miles away. It received data from the probe, the only telescope in the world capable of doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. xii, pp. 239–244&lt;br /&gt;Lovell, ''Astronomer by Chance'', p. 272&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894817,00.html | title=Voice in Space | publisher=Time Magazine | date=21 March 1960 | accessdate=2007-04-09}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,827621,00.html | title=Big Voice from Space | publisher=[[Time Magazine]] | date=23 May 1960 | accessdate=2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1966, Jodrell Bank was asked by the Soviet Union to track its unmanned moon lander [[Luna 9]] and recorded on its [[Fax|facsimile]] transmission of photographs from the moon's surface.

== Mark II and III telescopes ==
{{main|Mark II (radio telescope)|Mark III (radio telescope)}}
[[Image:Jodrell Bank Mark II.jpg|thumb|The [[Mark II (radio telescope)|Mark II]] radio telescope]]
The Mark II is an elliptical radio telescope, with a major axis {{convert|38.1|m|ft}} and a minor axis of {{convert|25.4|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name="jbo_mk2"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/history/mk2.html | title=The MKII Radio Telescope | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2007-06-01 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027221041/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/history/mk2.html | archivedate=27 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was constructed in 1964. As well as operating as a standalone telescope, it has been used as an interferometer with the Lovell Telescope, and is now primarily used as part of the [[MERLIN]] project.&lt;ref name="interferometer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quest"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merlin.ac.uk/about/layman/quest.html | title=The quest for the resolving power | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Mark III (radio telescope)|Mark III telescope]], the same size as the Mark II, was constructed to be transportable&lt;ref name="nature"&gt;Palmer and Rowson (1968)&lt;/ref&gt; but it was never moved from [[Wardle, Cheshire|Wardle]], near [[Nantwich]], where it was used as part of [[MERLIN]]. It was built in 1966 and decommissioned in 1996.&lt;ref name="merlin_locations"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merlin.ac.uk/user_guide/OnlineMUG-ajh/newch0-node62.html | title=MERLIN user guide—4.1 Location of Telescopes | accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mark IV, V and VA telescope proposals ==
[[Image:Mark V radio telescope model.jpg|thumb|upright|A model of the proposed Mark V radio telescope]]
The Mark IV, V and VA telescope proposals were put forward in the 1960s through to the 1980s to build even larger radio telescopes.

The Mark IV proposal was for a {{convert|1000|ft|m}} diameter standalone telescope, built as a national project.

The Mark V  proposal was for a {{convert|400|ft|m}} moveable telescope. The concept of this proposal was for a telescope on a 3/4-mile long railway line adjoining Jodrell Bank but concerns about future levels of interference meant that a site in Wales would have been preferable.  Design proposals by Husband and Co and Freeman Fox, who had designed the [[Parkes Observatory]] telescope were put forward.

The Mark VA was similar to the Mark V but with a smaller dish of {{convert|375|ft|m}} and a design using [[prestressed concrete]], similar to the Mark II (the previous two designs more closely resembled the Lovell telescope).&lt;ref name="jb_telescopes"&gt;Lovell, ''Jodrell Bank Telescopes''&lt;/ref&gt;

None of the proposed telescopes was constructed, although design studies were carried out and scale models were made, partly because of the changing political climate, partly to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the UK and it became necessary to upgrade the Lovell Telescope to the Mark IA, which overran in terms of cost.&lt;ref name="jb_telescopes"/&gt;

A 50&amp;nbsp;ft (15&amp;nbsp;m) alt-azimuth dish was constructed in 1964 for astronomical research and to track the [[Zond 1]], [[Zond 2]], [[Ranger 6]] and [[Ranger 7]] space probes&lt;ref name="earlyprobetracking"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/history/tracking/ | title=Jodrell Bank's role in early space tracking activities | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2007-06-10 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027221051/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/history/tracking/ | archivedate=27 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Apollo 11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.open2.net/historyandthearts/history/three_transcript_p.html | title=The other space race: Transcript | publisher=[[BBC]]/[[Open University]] | accessdate=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an accident that irreparably damaged the 50&amp;nbsp;ft telescope's surface, it was demolished in 1982 and replaced with a more accurate telescope, the "42&amp;nbsp;ft". The 42&amp;nbsp;ft (12.8&amp;nbsp;m) dish is mainly used to observe pulsars, and continually monitors the [[Crab Pulsar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/booklet/Pulsars.html | title=Jodrell Bank—Pulsars | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory|accessdate=2007-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the 42&amp;nbsp;ft was installed, a smaller dish, the "7&amp;nbsp;m" (actually 6.4 m, or 21&amp;nbsp;ft, in diameter) was installed and is used for undergraduate teaching. The 42&amp;nbsp;ft and 7&amp;nbsp;m telescopes were originally used at the [[Woomera Rocket Testing Range]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/tour/lobs.html | title=JBO—Lovell Observing Room | accessdate=2007-06-10 | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720151959/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/tour/lobs.html | archivedate=20 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 7&amp;nbsp;m was originally constructed in 1970 by [[Marconi Company]].&lt;ref name="7m"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/tech/7m/7m_telescope.html | title=NRAL—7&amp;nbsp;m Telescope | accessdate=2008-05-08|publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Polar Axis telescope was built in 1962. It had a circular 50&amp;nbsp;ft (15.2&amp;nbsp;m) dish on a [[polar mount]],&lt;ref name="jbtelescopes_232"&gt;Lovell, ''Jodrell Bank Telescopes'', p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; and was mostly used for moon radar experiments. It has been decommissioned. An {{convert|18|in|mm|sing=on}} reflecting optical telescope was donated to the observatory in 1951&lt;ref name="history_manuni_37"&gt;Pullan, ''A history of the University of Manchester 1951–73'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; but was not used much, and was donated to the Salford Astronomical Society around 1971.&lt;ref name="salford_astro_society"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salfordastro.org.uk/salford-observatory/ | title=Salford Astronomical Society—Observatory | accessdate=2007-04-23 | publisher=Salford Observatory | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202234118/http://www.salfordastro.org.uk/salford-observatory/ | archivedate=2 December 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MERLIN ==
{{main|MERLIN}}
The Multi-Element Radio Linked [[Interferometer]] Network (MERLIN) is an array of [[radio telescope]]s spread across England and the Welsh borders. The array is run from Jodrell Bank on behalf of the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] as a National Facility.&lt;ref name="merlin"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.merlin.ac.uk/ | title=MERLIN/VLBI National Facility | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | accessdate=2007-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The array consists of up to seven [[radio telescope]]s and includes the Lovell Telescope, the Mark II, [[Cambridge]], [[Defford]], [[Knockin]], [[Darnhall]], and [[Pickmere]] (previously known as [[Tabley Superior|Tabley]]). The longest baseline is {{convert|217|km|mi}} and MERLIN can operate at [[Frequency|frequencies]] between 151 [[Megahertz|MHz]] and 24 [[Hertz|GHz]].&lt;ref name="merlin_locations"/&gt; At a [[wavelength]] of 6&amp;nbsp;cm (5&amp;nbsp;GHz frequency), MERLIN has a resolution of 50&amp;nbsp;milli[[arcsecond]]s which is comparable to that of the [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] at optical wavelengths.&lt;ref name="merlin"/&gt;

== Very Long Baseline Interferometry ==
{{main|European VLBI Network|Very Long Baseline Interferometry}}
Jodrell Bank has been involved with [[Very Long Baseline Interferometry]] (VLBI) since the late 1960s; the Lovell telescope took part in the first transatlantic interferometer experiment in 1968, with other telescopes at [[Algonquin Radio Observatory|Algonquin]] and [[Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory|Penticton]] in Canada.&lt;ref name="zenith_67"&gt;Lovell, ''Out of the Zenith'', pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt; The Lovell Telescope and the Mark II telescopes are regularly used for VLBI with telescopes across Europe (the [[European VLBI Network]]), giving a resolution of around 0.001 [[arcseconds]].&lt;ref name="interferometer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/booklet/Merlin.html|title=The Merlin and VLBI National Facility|publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory|accessdate=2009-07-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501163251/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/booklet/Merlin.html|archivedate=1 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, of which the Observatory is a part, is one of the largest astrophysics research groups in the UK.&lt;ref name="physics_researchgroups"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.physics.manchester.ac.uk/research/groups/| title=Research groups: School of Physics and Astronomy| publisher=The University of Manchester| accessdate=2007-08-05| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818051757/http://www.physics.manchester.ac.uk/research/groups/| archivedate=18 August 2007| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; About half of the research of the group is in the area of radio astronomy—including research into [[pulsar]]s, the [[Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation]], [[gravitational lens]]es, [[active galaxy|active galaxies]] and [[astrophysical maser]]s. The group also carries out research at different wavelengths, looking into [[star formation]] and evolution, [[planetary nebulae]] and [[astrochemistry]].&lt;ref name="research"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/research/ | title=Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics Research | accessdate=2007-08-05|publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first director of Jodrell Bank was [[Bernard Lovell]], who established the observatory in 1945. He was succeeded in 1980 by [[Francis Graham-Smith|Sir Francis Graham-Smith]], followed by [[Rod Davies|Professor Rod Davies]] around 1990 and [[Andrew Lyne|Professor Andrew Lyne]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="lyne_appointment"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/news/1999/director/dir_nral.html | title=Director of the Nuffield Radio Astronomy Laboratories, Jodrell Bank | accessdate=2007-05-29 | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720152015/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/news/1999/director/dir_nral.html | archivedate=20 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phil Diamond|Professor Phil Diamond]] took over the role on 1 October 2006, at the time when the [[Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics]] was formed. Prof Ralph Spencer was Acting Director during 2009 and 2010. In October 2010, Prof. Albert Zijlstra became Director of the Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics. Professor Lucio Piccirillo was the Director of the Observatory from Oct 2010 to Oct 2011 when Prof Simon Garrington became its managing director.

In May 2017 Jodrell Bank entered into a partnership with the [[Breakthrough Listen]] initiative and will share information with Jodrell Bank’s team, who wish to conduct an independent SETI search via its 76-m radio telescope and e-MERLIN array.

There is an active development programme researching and constructing telescope receivers and instrumentation. The observatory has been involved in the construction of several [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] experiments, including the [[Tenerife Experiment]], which ran from the 1980s to 2000, and the amplifiers and cryostats for the [[Very Small Array]].&lt;ref name="vsa_cryostats"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/tech/technology/vsa.html | title=JBO—VSA Receivers | accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also constructed the front-end modules of the 30 and 44&amp;nbsp;GHz receivers for the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck spacecraft]].&lt;ref name="jb_bigbang"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/booklet/BigBang.html | title=Jodrell Bank—Observing the Big Bang | accessdate=2007-06-10|publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Receivers were also designed at Jodrell Bank for the [[Parkes Observatory|Parkes Telescope]] in Australia.&lt;ref name="jodrellbank_anatomy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/lovell/anatomy.html | title=Jodrell Bank—Anatomy of a Radio Telescope | accessdate=2007-06-10 | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016100922/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/lovell/anatomy.html | archivedate=16 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aa Jodrellbank newbldg 00.jpg|thumb|New visitor's centre being constructed at Jodrell Bank in March 2011]]

A visitors' centre opened on 19 April 1971 by the [[Duke of Devonshire]],&lt;ref name="zenith"&gt;Lovell, ''Out of the Zenith''&lt;/ref&gt; attracted around 120,000 visitors per year. It covered the history of Jodrell Bank and had a 3D theatre hosting simulated trips to [[Mars]].
[[Asbestos]] in the visitors' centre buildings led to its demolition in 2003 leaving a remnant of its far end. A [[Tent#Marquees and larger tents|marquee]] was set up in its grounds while a new science centre was planned. The plans were shelved when [[Victoria University of Manchester]] and [[UMIST]] merged to become the [[University of Manchester]] in 2004, leaving the interim centre, which received around 70,000 visitors a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.channel4.com/news/articles/science_technology/government+stifling+scientists/1888047| title=Government 'stifling scientists' | publisher=[[PA News]] | date=28 March 2008 | accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A path around the Lovell telescope is approximately 20&amp;nbsp;m from the telescope's outer railway, information boards explain how the telescope works and the research that is done with it.

The {{convert|35|acre|m2}} [[arboretum]], created in 1972, houses the UK's national collections of [[crab apple]] ''Malus'' and [[Sorbus|mountain ash]] ''Sorbus'' species, and the Heather Society's ''[[Calluna]]'' collection. The arboretum also has a small [[scale model]] of the [[solar system]], the scale is approximately 1:5,000,000,000. At Jodrell Bank, as part of the ''SpacedOut'' project, is the Sun in a 1:15,000,000 scale model of the solar system covering Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spacedout-uk.com/solar_system/solar_info.asp?site_id=2 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051213212326/http://www.spacedout-uk.com/solar_system/solar_info.asp?site_id=2 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2005-12-13 | title=SpacedOut Location: The Sun at Jodrell Bank | accessdate=2007-06-08 | publisher=SpacedOut }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 July 2010, it was announced that the observatory was being considered for the 2011 United Kingdom Tentative List for [[World Heritage Site]] status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.culture.gov.uk/news/news_stories/7221.aspx | title = Applicants for UK Tentative World Heritage Status | accessdate = 2010-09-04 | publisher = Department for Culture Media and Sport}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on 22 March 2011 that it was on the UK government's shortlist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/22/uk-nominations-world-heritage-status | title=UK nominates 11 sites for Unesco world heritage status | publisher=Guardian | date=22 March 2011 | accessdate=2011-03-22 | first=Maev | last=Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, it became the UK's candidate for World Heritage status.&lt;ref name=Unesco_2018&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.unesco.org.uk/news/jodrell-bank-selected-as-next-uk-nomination-for-world-heritage-site-status/ |title=Jodrell Bank selected as next UK nomination for UNESCO World Heritage Site status |publisher=The United Kingdom National Commission for UNESCO |date=2018 |accessdate=22 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 the visitor centre and observatory hosted "Jodrell Bank Live" – a rock concert with bands including [[The Flaming Lips]], [[British Sea Power]], [[Wave Machines]], [[OK GO]] and [[Alice Gold]].&lt;ref name="jblive"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodrellbanklive.co.uk/shows | title=Shows: Live from Jodrell Bank | accessdate=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 July 2012 Elbow performed live at the observatory and filmed a documentary of the event and the facility which was released as a live CD/DVD of the concert.

On 31 August 2013 Jodrell Bank hosted a concert performed by the [[Halle Orchestra]] to commemorate what would have been Lovell's 100th birthday. As well as a number of operatic performances during the day, the evening Halle performance saw numbers such as themes from [[Star Trek]], [[Star Wars]] and [[Doctor Who]] among others. The main Lovell telescope was rotated to face the onlooking crowd and used as a huge projection screen showing various animated planetary effects. During the interval the 'screen' was used to show a history of Lovell's work and Jodrell Bank.

There is an astronomy [[podcast]] from the observatory, named ''The [[Jodcast]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jodcast.net | title=The Jodcast | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory| accessdate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] television programme ''[[Stargazing Live]]'' is hosted in the control room of the observatory. The programme has had four series, in January 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-20958297 |publisher=BBC News |title=Stargazing Live: Behind the scenes at Jodrell Bank |accessdate= 14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, the observatory will hold [[Bluedot Festival|Bluedot]], a music and science festival, featuring [[Public Service Broadcasting (band)|Public Service Broadcasting]], [[The Chemical Brothers]], [[Jim Al-Khalili]] and [[Richard Dawkins]].

==Planetarium==
Jodrell Bank's visitor centre had a [[planetarium]] until 2003, when it and much else was demolished because of risk of [[asbestos]]. The planetarium projector was one-ended, with one star ball, and it could not show stars near the south pole.

Currently (as at 2018) they only have a small inflatable planetarium dome.

A new planetarium with a computer-generated display will be built in the arboretum, starting in February or March 2019.

== Threat of closure ==
On 3 March 2008, it was reported that Britain's [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC), faced with an £80 million shortfall in its budget, was considering withdrawing its planned £2.7 million annual funding of Jodrell Bank's [[MERLIN#e-MERLIN|e-MERLIN]] project. The project, which aims to replace the [[microwave]] links between Jodrell Bank and a number of other radio telescopes with high-bandwidth [[Optical fiber|fibre-optic]] cables, greatly increasing the sensitivity of observations, is seen as critical to the survival of the establishment in its present form. Sir [[Bernard Lovell]] was quoted as saying "It will be a disaster … The fate of the Jodrell Bank telescope is bound up with the fate of e-MERLIN. I don't think the establishment can survive if the e-MERLIN funding is cut".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/7281176.stm | title=Jodrell Bank fears funding loss | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date= 6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article3500905.ece | title=Professor Sir Bernard Lovell condemns 'disastrous' plan to close Jodrell Bank | publisher=[[The Times]] | date=7 March 2008 | location=London | first1=Lewis | last1=Smith | first2=Sam | last2=Coates | accessdate=2010-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 14 April 2008, Cheshire's [[106.9 Silk FM]] unveiled to its listeners their own campaign song to save Jodrell Bank, entitled "The Jodrell Bank Song" and sung by a group dubbed "The Astronomers". Along with the song, the Silk FM team also produced a music video filmed in front of the iconic Lovell telescope. Silk FM released the song for download from Monday 21 April 2008. All proceeds went towards saving Jodrell Bank.

On 9 July 2008, it was reported that, following an independent review, the STFC had reversed its initial position and would after all guarantee funding of £2.5 million annually for three years.&lt;ref name="timesrescuedeal"&gt;{{cite news |title=Deal to rescue Jodrell Bank helps Britain see its future in the stars |publisher=The Times |date=9 July 2008 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/science/article4297239.ece}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fictional references ==
Jodrell Bank has been mentioned {{clarify|date=June 2015}} in several popular works of fiction, including [[Doctor Who]] (''[[The Tenth Planet]]'', ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'', ''[[The Poison Sky]]'', ''[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]''). It was intended to be a filming location for ''[[Logopolis]]'' ([[Tom Baker]]'s final ''Doctor Who'' serial) but budget restrictions prevented this and another location with a superimposed model of a radio telescope was used instead. It was also mentioned in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''&lt;ref name="hitchhiker"&gt;Adams, ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', p. 30–31&lt;/ref&gt; (as well as [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' film]]), ''[[The Creeping Terror]]'' and ''[[Meteor (film)|Meteor]]''. Jodrell Bank also featured heavily in the music video to ''[[Electric Light Orchestra]]'''s 1983 single ''[[Secret Messages]]''. The [[Prefab Sprout]] song Technique (from debut album Swoon) opens with the line "Her husband works at Jodrell Bank/He's home late in the morning".

The Observatory is the site of several episodes in the novel ''[[Boneland]]'', by [[Alan Garner]] (2012), and the central character, Colin Whisterfield, is an astrophysicist on its staff.

==Appraisal==
Since 13 July 1988 the Lovell Telescope has been designated as a Grade I [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num= 1221685|desc= Jodrell Bank Observatory: Lovell Telescope|access-date=16 July 2017 |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 10 July 2017 the [[Mark II (radio telescope)|Mark II Telescope]] was also designated at the same grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num= 1443087|desc= Jodrell Bank Observatory: Mark II Telescope|access-date=16 July 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the same date five other buildings on the site were designated at Grade II; namely the Searchlight Telescope,&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num= 1443133|desc= Jodrell Bank Observatory: 71MHz Searchlight Aerial|access-date=16 July 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Control Building,&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num= 1443868|desc= Jodrell Bank Observatory: Control Building|access-date=16 July 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Park Royal Building,&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num= 1443093|desc= Jodrell Bank Observatory: Park Royal Building|access-date=16 July 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Electrical Workshop,&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num= 1444238|desc= Jodrell Bank Observatory: Electrical Workshop (Former Main Office)|access-date=16 July 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Link Hut.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num= 1443486|desc= Jodrell Bank Observatory: Link Hut (Cosmic Noise Hut)|access-date=16 July 2017 |mode=cs2|fewer-links=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grade I is the highest of the three grades of listing, and is applied to buildings that are of "exceptional interest", and Grade&amp;nbsp;II, the lowest grade, is applied to buildings "of special interest".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/| title = What is Listing? | accessdate = 16 July 2017| publisher = Historic England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3885">[[Image:La justice de Trajan.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Justice of Trajan'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]], 1840.]] 
The '''Justice of Trajan''' is a legendary episode in the life of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]], based upon [[Dio Cassius]]' account (Epitome of Book LXVIII, chapter 10): "He did not, however, as might have been expected of a warlike man, pay any less attention to the civil administration nor did he dispense justice any the less; on the contrary, he conducted trials, now in the Forum of Augustus, now in the Portico of Livia, as it was called, and often elsewhere on a tribunal."

According to the story, Trajan, busy with preparations for the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]], was petitioned for justice by the mother of a murdered man. He asked her to wait until he returned, but she pointed out that he might not return at all. He made time to settle her case despite all the other calls on his time. The legend, though indirectly, was popularized by [[Dante]] in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', alluded to in the Paradise, and recounted in Purgatory, X, 73-94:

{{cquote|The wretch appear'd amid all these to say:&lt;br&gt;
"Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart&lt;br&gt;
My son is murder'd." He replying seem'd;&lt;br&gt;
"Wait now till I return." And she, as one&lt;br&gt;
Made hasty by her grief; "O sire, if thou&lt;br&gt;
Dost not return?"—"Where I am, who then is,&lt;br&gt;
May right thee."—"What to thee is other's good,&lt;br&gt;
If thou neglect thy own?"—"Now comfort thee,"&lt;br&gt;
At length he answers. "It beseemeth well&lt;br&gt;
My duty be perform'd, ere I move hence:&lt;br&gt;
So justice wills; and pity bids me stay.}}

The origin of the legend and its vicissitudes since antiquity have been the subject of several studies, including the detailed "Leggende" by G. Boni, published in 1906. The episode was reflected in several works of art and in the verse ''The Justice'' by Belarusian poet [[Simeon of Polotsk]] (1629—1680). Among artists that depicted the legend are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Hans Sebald Beham]], [[Noël Coypel]] and [[Noël Hallé]]. A French painter [[Raoul Dufy]] was inspired by Delacroix's painting of the justice.

Historically, ''the justice of Trajan'' may also refer either to what was described by [[Pliny the Younger]] (''Epistulae'', VI, 31, a court trial in [[Centumcellae]]) or depicted on [[Trajan's Column]], where Trajan judges the captured barbarian chiefs, or to a lost painting by [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. (The city of Brussels commissioned Van der Weyden to paint four large panel paintings for the [[Brussels Town Hall]] illustrating the 'Justice of Trajan' and the '[[Justice of Herkenbald]]'; they were destroyed when the [[Bombardment of Brussels|French bombarded the city in 1695]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dirk de Vos, 1999, ''Rogier van der Weyden'', pp. 345-355&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letter cutting''' is a form of inscriptional architectural lettering closely related to [[monumental masonry]] and [[stone carving]], often practiced by artists, [[sculpture|sculptors]], and [[typeface designer]]s. Rather than traditional stone carving, where images and symbols are the dominant features, in letter cutting it is the beauty of the stone carver's calligraphy that is the focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.traditionalmasonry.co.uk/TraditionalCraftSkills/LetterCuttingAndCarving.aspx traditionalmasonry.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Notable practitioners include:

{{More citations needed|date=February 2008}}

Computer systems that use a 4-bit or 8-bit [[pixel]] [[Color depth|depth]] can display up to 16 or 256 colors simultaneously.  Many [[personal computer]]s in the early 1990s displayed at most 256 different colors, freely selected by [[software]] (either by the user or by a program) from their wider hardware's [[RGB]] color palette.

Usual selections of colors in limited subsets (generally 16 or 256) of the full palette includes some RGB level arrangements commonly used with the 8-bit palettes as ''[[Palette (computing)#Adaptative vs. master palettes|master palettes]]'' or ''universal palettes'' (i.e., palettes for multipurpose uses).

These are some representative software palettes, but any selection can be made in such type of systems.

For specific hardware color palettes, see the [[List of monochrome and RGB palettes]], [[List of 8-bit computer hardware palettes]], the [[List of 16-bit computer hardware palettes]] and the [[List of videogame consoles palettes]] articles.

Each palette is represented by an array of color patches. A one-pixel size version appears below each palette, to make it easy to compare palette sizes.

For each unique palette, an image color test chart and sample image ([[True Color|truecolor]] original follows) rendered with that palette (without [[dithering]]) are given. The test chart shows the full 8-bit, 256 levels of the red, green, and blue ([[RGB]]) primary colors and cyan, magenta, and yellow complementary colors, along with a full 8-bit, 256 levels grayscale. Gradients of RGB intermediate colors (orange, lime green, sea green, sky blue, violet and fuchsia), and a full [[hue]] spectrum are also present. Color charts are not [[Gamma correction|gamma]] corrected.

|}

These elements illustrate the [[color depth]] and distribution of the colors of any given palette, and the sample image indicates how the color selection of such palettes could represent real-life images.
&lt;!-- Note: please do not change the compression scheme of every image by a lossy compression scheme (i.e. [[JPEG]]) in order to improve their file size, nor change the thumbnail size of the images, nor gamma-correct them. They are didactical material AS IS, and they have been already optimized for this purpose. --&gt;

==System specifics==

These are selections of colors officially employed as ''system palettes'' in some popular [[operating system]]s for [[personal computer]]s that support 8-bit displays.

In 256-color mode, there are four additional standard Windows colors, twenty system reserved colors in total;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/sample43/1/W95/EN-US/Palman.exe The Palette Manager: How and Why It Does What It Does], the article is in Windows Write file inside self-extracting archive.&lt;/ref&gt; thus the system leaves 236 palette indexes free for applications to use.  The system color entries inside a 256-color palette table are the first ten plus the last ten. In any case, the additional system colors do not seem to add a sharp color richness: they are only some intermediate shades of grayish colors.

==RGB arrangements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}

These are selections of colors based in evenly ordered RGB levels which provide complete RGB combinations, mainly used as ''[[Palette (computing)#Adaptative vs. master palettes|master palettes]]'' to display any kind of image within the limitations of the 8-bit pixel [[Color depth|depth]].

===6 level RGB===

:{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
|| [[Image:RGB 6levels palette sample image.png]]
|| [[Image:RGB 6levels palette color test chart.png]]
|}

Having six levels for every primary, with 6³ = 216 combinations. The index can be addressed by (36×R)+(6×G)+B, with all R, G and B values in a range from 0 to 5. Intended as homogeneous RGB cube, it gives six true grays. Also there is room for another sorts of 40 colors, so operating systems or programs can add extra colors.

:[[Image:RGB 6levels palette.png]]

Systems that use this software palette are:

* [[Web palette]]
* [[Apple Macintosh]] 256 color default palette, it also contains four gradients of ten shades each for gray, red, green and blue.

===6-7-6 levels RGB===

:{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
|| [[Image:RGB 6-7-6-levels palette sample image.png]]
|| [[Image:RGB 6-7-6-levels palette color test chart.png]]
|}

This palette is constructed with six levels for red and blue primaries and seven levels for the green primary, giving 6×7×6 = 252 combinations. The index can be addressed by (42×R)+(6×G)+B, with R and B values in a range from 0 to 5 and G in a range from 0 to 6. The same case as the former, but with an added level of green due to the greater sensibility of the normal human eye to this frequency.

:[[Image:RGB 6-7-6levels palette.png]]

It does not provide true grays, but remaining indexes can be filled with four intermediate grays. In any case, there is little room for any other color.

===6-8-5 levels RGB===

:{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
|| [[Image:RGB 6-8-5levels palette sample image.png]]
|| [[Image:RGB 6-8-5levels palette color test chart.png]]
|}

This palette is constructed with six levels for red, eight levels for green and five levels for the blue primaries, giving 6×8×5 = 240 combinations. The index can be addressed by (40×R)+(5×G)+B, with R ranging from 0 to 5, G from 0 to 7 and B from 0 to 4. Levels are chosen in function of sensibility of the normal human eye to every primary color.

:[[Image:RGB 6-8-5levels palette.png]]

Also, it does not provide true grays. Remaining indexes can be filled with sixteen intermediate grays or other fixed colors. In fact, this is the best balanced RGB ''master'' software palette{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}, in a compromise between the RGB arrangement based in the human eye's sensibility and a sufficient remaining palette entries for another purposes.

===8-8-4 levels RGB===

:{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
|| [[Image:RGB 8-8-4-levels palette sample image.png]]
|| [[Image:RGB 8-8-4-levels palette color test chart.png]]
|}

The 8-8-4 level RGB use eight levels for each of the red and green color components (3+3 high order bits), and four levels (2 low order bits) for the blue component, due to the lesser sensitivity of the normal human eye to this primary color. This results in an 8×8×4 = 256-color palette as follows:

:[[Image:RGB 8-8-4-levels palette.png]]

This RGB software palette occupies the full 8-bit range of possible palette entries, so there is no room for other fixed colors. Software using this palette must draw their user interface elements with the same colors used to show pictures. Also again, it does not provide true grays.

==Other common uses of software palettes==

===Grayscale palettes===

:{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
|| [[Image:Grayscale 8bits palette sample image.png]]
|| [[Image:Grayscale 8bits palette color test chart.png]]
|}

Simple palette made doing every triplet RGB primaries having equal values as a continuous gradient from black to white through the full available palette entries. Here is the 8-bit, 256 levels palette:

:[[Image:Grayscale 8bits palette.png]]

Used to display pure [[grayscale]] [[TIFF]] or [[JPEG]] images, for example.

===Color gradient palettes===

Palettes made of a continuous color gradient from darkest to lightest arbitrary hues. The pixel data is treated as if it were grayscale, but the color table plays with RGB color combinations, not only gray. The relationship between the original [[luminance (relative)|luminance]] and the mapped one can vary, but the lighting scale is preserved along all the palette entries.

One very common case of such palettes is the [[sepia tone]] palette, which gives an image an old fashioned and aged look (left). Another gradient example, based on blue hues, is presented here (right), but any hue or mixing of hues can be used. Many [[cell phone]]s with built-in cameras have options to take colorized photos using this technique.

===Adaptive palettes===

:{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
|| [[Image:Adaptative 8bits palette sample image.png]]
|| [[Image:Adaptative 8bits palette color test chart.png]]
|}

Those whose whole number of available indexes are filled with RGB combinations selected from the statistical order of appearance (usually balanced) of a concrete full [[False color#True color|true color]] original image. There exist many algorithms to pick the colors through [[color quantization]]; one well known is the [[Heckbert's median-cut algorithm]]. Here is the 8-bit, 256 color palette used with the color test chart and the image sample above:

:[[Image:Adaptative 8bits palette.png]]

Adaptive palettes only work well with a [[Palette (computing)#Adaptative vs. master palettes|unique image]]. Trying to display different images with adaptive palettes over an 8-bit display usually results in only one image with correct colors, because the images have different palettes and only one can be displayed at a time. Here is an example of what happens when an indexed color image is displayed with any color palette that is not its own adaptive palette:

:[[Image:Incorrect 8bits palette sample image.png]]

===False color palettes===

:{| style="border-style: none" border="0" cellpadding="0"
|-
|| [[Image:False colors palette sample image.png]]
|| [[Image:False colors palette color test chart.png]]
|}

Arbitrary gradient color scales, usually 256 shades, with no relationship with real colors of a given image. They are employed to artificially colorize a grayscale image to reveal details and/or to map the pixel level values to amounts of some physical magnitude ([[potential]], [[temperature]], altitude, etc.)

Note, in the example above, that new details can be seen as blue over magenta in the background's dark areas of the original photograph.

Here is the 8-bit, 256 color gradient palette used with the color test chart and the image sample above:

:[[Image:False colors palette.png]]

There exist many [[False-color|false color]] palettes, some of them standardized, used mainly in scientific applications: [[astronomy]] and [[radioastronomy]], [[Remote sensing|satellite land imaging]], [[thermography]], study of materials, [[tomography]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]] in medicine, etc.

[[Image:oceanic spreading.svg|thumb|250px|right|Oceanic crust is formed at an oceanic ridge, while the lithosphere is subducted back into the asthenosphere at trenches.]]

'''Marine geology''' or '''geological oceanography''' is the study of the history and structure of the ocean floor. It involves [[geophysical]], [[geochemistry|geochemical]], [[sedimentology|sedimentological]] and [[paleontological]] investigations of the [[ocean floor]] and [[coastal zone]]. Marine geology has strong ties to [[geophysics]] and to [[physical oceanography]].

Marine geological studies were of extreme importance in providing the critical evidence for [[sea floor spreading]] and [[plate tectonics]] in the years following World War II. The deep ocean floor is the last essentially unexplored frontier and detailed mapping in support of both military (submarine) objectives and economic ([[petroleum]] and [[metal]] [[mining]]) objectives drives the research.

==Overview==
[[Image:Marianatrenchmap.png|thumb|left|A trench forms at the boundary where two tectonic plates meet]]

The [[Pacific Ring of Fire|Ring of Fire]] around the [[Pacific Ocean]] with its attendant intense [[volcanism]] and [[seismic]] activity poses a major threat for disastrous [[earthquake]]s, [[tsunami]]s and volcanic eruptions. Any ''early warning'' systems for these disastrous events will require a more detailed understanding of marine geology of coastal and [[island arc]] environments.

The study of [[littoral]] and deep sea sedimentation and the precipitation and dissolution rates of [[calcium carbonate]] in various marine environments has important implications for global [[climate change]].

The discovery and continued study of [[Mid-oceanic ridge|mid-ocean rift]] zone volcanism and [[hydrothermal vent]]s, first in the [[Red Sea]] and later along the [[East Pacific Rise]] and the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] systems were and continue to be important areas of marine geological research. The [[extremophile]] organisms discovered living within and adjacent to those hydrothermal systems have had a pronounced impact on our understanding of life on Earth and potentially the [[origin of life]] within such an environment.

[[Oceanic trench]]es are hemispheric-scale long but narrow topographic depressions of the sea floor. They also are the deepest parts of the ocean floor.

The [[Mariana Trench]] (or Marianas Trench) is the deepest known submarine trench, and the deepest location in the Earth's crust itself. A [[subduction zone]] where the [[Pacific Plate]] is being subducted under the [[Philippine Sea Plate]]. The bottom of the trench is further below sea level than [[Mount Everest]] is above sea level.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30872">'''Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers''' ('''MRSECs''') are university based research centers supported by the MRSEC Program of the Division of Materials Research at the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF). The  centers support interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary research of fundamental and technological importance and integrate research with education.  MRSECs require outstanding research quality, intellectual breadth, support for research infrastructure, and education outreach. MRSECs facilitate active collaborations between academic institutions, national laboratories, and industry, as well international collaborations.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;[http://www.mrsec.org/mrsec-program-overview "MRSEC Program Overview"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
MRSECs form a significant component of NSF's center-based research portfolio, but are also of historical importance. MRSECs were established by NSF in 1994&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but have their roots in the NSF Materials Research Laboratories (MRLs) started in 1972, which in turn evolved from the Interdisciplinary Laboratories (IDLs) initiated by the Department of Defense in 1960.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;R.L. Sproull, "Materials Research Laboratories: The Early Years" in ''Advancing Materials Research''  (P.A. Psaras and H. D. Lanford, eds., National Academy Press, Washington, D.C. 1987), pps. 25-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;L.H. Schwartz, "Materials Research Laboratories: Reviewing the First Twenty-Five Years" in ''Advancing Materials Research''  (P.A. Psaras and H. D. Lanford, eds., National Academy Press, Washington, D.C. 1987), pps. 35-48.&lt;/ref&gt; These cross-disciplinary, center-based activities required significant changes in how materials research and education were carried out at academic institutions and the IDLs/MRLs are credited with contributing to the accelerating growth of  [[Materials Science and Engineering]] Departments in the U.S.  in the 1960s to 1980s.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They also made significant contributions to the National Materials Program that emerged from the early post [[Sputnik]] era, leading to a vigorous growth in science and engineering graduate education and the development of university based experimental facilities.&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since much of the information regarding current MRSECs is available from websites&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; only a brief overview of the current program is provided. The main purpose of this article is to review the historical aspects of MRSECs and the significance of their impact on materials research and education in the U.S.

== Current MRSEC Status ==

===Program Summary ===

The research carried out in MRSECs is carried out in interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs), teams of six to a dozen or more researchers working on a current research topic of national significance. MRSECs range in size from two to four IRGs. The topics of the IRGs within a center may be focused on closely related scientific or technological topics or can cover distinctly different areas of research.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding levels for a given MRSEC currently range approximately from $1.5 to $3.5 million annually, depending of the overall scope of the research program. Each center has considerable flexibility to distribute its funds consistent with its proposed and approved research and education proposal.  In addition, the centers are strongly encouraged to apply a modest fraction of their funds for support of "seed projects," allowing them to respond quickly to promising new research opportunities.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

MRSECs feature partnerships with other academic institutions, national laboratories, and industry as well as international collaborations. The centers also feature extensive experimental and computational facilities, which are generally accessible to outside users.  A recently established facility network coordinates access to a broad range of experimental tools across the nationwide network of MRSECs.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A key mandate for these centers is the training and education of a future highly skilled workforce. The largest component of the center's funding is directed toward support of students (undergraduate and graduate), and postdoctoral researchers.  In addition, MRSECS carry out a broad range of education and outreach activities involving K - 12 students and public education through collaborations with museums and other public institutions.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=garcia&gt;U. Strom, "Garcia Center Leads Students from the Laboratory to the Real World", MRS Bulletin 32, 728-730 (2007). [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7960721&amp;fileId=S0883769400008150}]&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Recent Competition Results ===

Generally, MRSEC awards are for six years with competitions held every three years.  Competitions are open to all US academic institutions and normally only one award is made per institution.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nine awards were made based on the competition held in 2010/2011&lt;ref name=nsfpress2010&gt;NSF Announces Results of the Materials Research Center and Teams Competition: [https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=121536 "National Science Foundation Press Release 11-186 (Sept. 8, 2011)"]&lt;/ref&gt; and twelve awards were made based on the 2013/2014 competition,&lt;ref name=nsfpress2015&gt; Funding cutting-edge, collaborative research.  NSF announces newest awards for Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers: [https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=134203&amp;WT.mc_id=USNSF_51&amp;WT.mc_ev=click "National Science Foundation Press Release 15-015 (Feb. 18, 2015)"]&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the total to 21 awards currently (June 2016) supported by the program.

== Historical Background ==

=== State of Materials Research Prior to 1960 ===

The modern study of materials intersects many of the traditional scientific disciplines, including physics, chemistry, engineering, and increasingly the biosciences and mathematics.  Until the middle of the 20th century the various disciplines approached the study of materials with their own distinctive methodologies. Interdisciplinary collaborations, especially at academic institutions, were not the norm.  Past exceptions were the successful collaborative approaches leading to the intense technological developments during the Second World War, including the military and peaceful applications of nuclear energy production.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;W.O. Baker, "Advances in Materials Research and Development" in Advancing Materials Research  (P.A. Psaras and H. D. Lanford, eds., National Academy Press, Washington, D.C. 1987), pps. 3-24.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The late 1950s saw important developments in how the federal government could play  an increasing role in supporting interdisciplinary, collaborative research at academic institutions. The successful launch of the Russian space satellite [[Sputnik]] on October 4, 1957 had a profound impact on how scientific and technological research was carried out in the United States.  Within a year of this date the federal government established two new agencies: The [[National  Aeronautic and Space Administration]] (NASA), which was to define US supported space exploration for the remainder of the century and beyond, and the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA, later [[DARPA]]) within the Department of Defense.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  ARPA was tasked with expanding the frontiers of technology and science, often with potential military applications. In addition, the [[National Defense Education Act of 1958]] had the main purpose to greatly increase the number of trained engineers, scientists, and mathematicians, and included provisions for financial assistance.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The post Sputnik enthusiasm for more investment in science research led to a broader recommendation in March 1958 for coordinating materials research in the United States by President Eisenhower's Science and Advisory Committee (PSAC). A subsequent report entitled "Strengthening American Science", was submitted to President Eisenhower in December 1958.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This report led, by Executive Order of President Eisenhower on March 13, 1959, to the formation of the Federal Council for Science and Technology.  One of the early actions of this council was the establishment of a "Coordinating Committee on Materials Research and Development" (CCMRD), which was chaired by John W. Williams, Director of Research of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). The ultimate outcome was the establishment of three university based Interdisciplinary Laboratories (IDLs) in mid 1960 under the supervision of ARPA.,&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The idea of an interdisciplinary laboratory in the solid state and materials sciences had already proved extremely successful in industrial laboratory settings (such as the Bell Laboratories and others) leading, for example,  to the development of the transistor and the laser. The establishment of such laboratories in an academic environment arose naturally from the demands of the post-Sputnik era for a large, highly trained, scientific workforce. American universities were ideally positioned to provide the opportunity to combine their educational mission with the planned development of larger, modern state-of-the-art experimental facilities.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Interdisciplinary Laboratories (IDLs) 1960-1972 ===

The creation of three Interdisciplinary laboratories, at Cornell University, the University of Pennsylvania, and Northwestern University, was officially announced by ARPA on July 11, 1960.&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The contracts required that these universities "shall establish an interdisciplinary materials research program and shall furnish the necessary personnel and facilities for the conduct of research in the science of materials..."&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  In the following year (1961) eight additional IDLs were created:&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Brown University, University of Chicago, Harvard, University of Maryland, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of North Carolina, Purdue University, and Stanford University.
  
A 12th IDL was added at the University of Illinois in 1962, which was administered by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC).  Subsequently, there were three more AEC contracts and two contracts through NASA.&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the AEC in establishing a strong materials research community was well known since the advent of nuclear reactors and the importance of materials in reactor cost, efficiency, and safety.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1955 [[John von Neumann]], renowned mathematician and contributor to the Manhattan Project, in his role as commissioner of the AEC and member of the AEC General Advisory Committee (GAC), strongly endorsed a materials-focused institute in an academic setting.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
  
The impact of the IDLs on the training of students was significant.  By 1969 over 360 new doctorate degrees were awarded. A report by the National Academy of Sciences&lt;ref name=coscmat&gt;National Academy of Sciences, Committee on the Survey of Materials Science and Engineering (COSCMAT), Materials and Man's Needs: Materials Science and Engineering, Vol.III (National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C., 1975), pp.&amp;nbsp;7–209 - 7-210&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that these center based programs were instrumental in defining "materials science and engineering" as a new interdisciplinary activity which was evidenced by a rapid increase of materials science departments between 1960 and 1970 and beyond.  In addition, to the building of new facilities infrastructure these centers of excellence led to the training of not only materials scientists, but also physicists, chemists, engineers and other professionals.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The National Academy study&lt;ref name=coscmat&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; noted that though the IDLs were considered a success, there was room for growth of interdisciplinary collaborations among faculty from different university departments. However, it was acknowledged that joint  block funding and joint use of shared experimental facilities by students and faculty from diverse departments had planted the seeds for increased interdisciplinarity in materials research.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

===  The Materials Research Laboratories (MRLs) 1972-1994 ===

In late 1969 an amendment to the Military Authorization Act, sponsored by Senator Mike Mansfield, placed restrictions on the funding of long-term basic research by agencies of the Department of Defense, including ARPA/DARPA.&lt;ref name=nsb70s&gt;The National Science Board: A History in Highlights 1950-2000; [https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/2000/nsb00215/nsb50/1970/mansfield.html "The 1970s: The Mansfield Amendment"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nsb80s&gt;The National Science Board: A History in Highlights 1950-2000; [https://www.nsf.gov/nsb/documents/2000/nsb00215/nsb50/1980/debate.html "The 1980s: The Debate over Centers"]&lt;/ref&gt; (ARPA was changed to DARPA in 1972). Consequently, a decision was made in 1970 to transfer the IDLs to the National Science Foundation.&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The block type IDL grant for multidisciplinary research and shared facilities would mean a distinct departure of NSF's funding approach at that time which was support of predominantly small, single investigator grants in a particular discipline.   After an in-depth review by NSF of the IDL program a transfer of the then existing 12 IDLs to NSF was recommended. However, the transfer came with several major critical provisions.  These included the following:&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

"The laboratories, now renamed 'Materials Research Laboratories', would retain locally administered block (or 'core') funding intended to 'facilitate research in materials science and engineering which is either difficult or unfeasible to carry out under traditional funding of individual research.' Most importantly, the new component added by NSF was that 'scientific excellence is viewed as a necessary, but no longer sufficient, condition to qualify for MRL core support.' In addition, the MRLs would be judged by their ability to foster 'coherent, multidisciplinary and multi-investigator projects requiring the expertise of two or more materials related disciplines.' These so-called thrust groups are the heart of the current core funding at MRLs; at their best they have achieved a transformation in the way materials research is done at universities and in the way graduate education proceeds."&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Acceptance by NSF of the new materials laboratories in 1972 led to the creation of the Division of Materials Research (DMR).  Its initial portfolio consisted of the MRL program as well as individual investigator programs closely related to materials science which were drawn from other parts of NSF.  Initially, the MRL program made up approximately 40% of the DMR budget. By 1985, with the growth of individual investigator and small group programs, the MRL program was funded at a level of about 20% of the total DMR budget.&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1972 and 1985, a number of additional MRLs were added and some of the existing centers were phased out.  The following table summarizes this information:&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;The National Science Foundation's Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers Program: Looking Back, Moving Forward, (The National Academies Press, 2007) [http://www.nap.edu/read/11966/chapter/1-xii "Read-only link"]&lt;/ref&gt;

MRL technical accomplishments are significant and have been detailed in a number of studies.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; J.G. Ling and M.A. Head, "Federal Funding in Materials Research," (summary of the findings of the MITRE report). Science 209, 1203 (1980); Technical Report 7764 (MITRE Corp., Bedford, Mass., Sept. 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Another important impact has been the cultural change at U.S. universities in how research could be conducted across traditional departmental boundaries.  This trend was initiated by the IDLs but greatly strengthened by the MRL program because of the new NSF guidelines concerning requirements for interdisciplinarity.  A new generation of students would be trained in a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary environment and the experiences of the IDL/MRL programs in the fields of materials and condensed matter sciences would be the proving ground for other center type endeavors in a wide range of fields.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=schwartz&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

===  Impact of IDLs/MRLs on other NSF Centers ===

The mid-1980s saw a convergence of a number of favorable trends for the establishments of NSF center based activities in a wide range of different fields. There was a strong interest in government investments in basic science that could be leveraged by matching funds from industry and other sources. In addition, the role of multidisciplinary teams in conducting research and educating students was widely appreciated.&lt;ref name=sproull&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The first new centers-based initiative at NSF was the creation of the [[Engineering Research Centers]] (ERCs) in 1985.  Although the role of the previous 25-year history of funding the materials laboratories in preparing universities to accept a wider role in conducting interdisciplinary research was instrumental for the creation of new types of centers, this historical connection was not widely appreciated. Both NSF and the Office of Science Technology Policy, viewed the creation of ERCs as the major new initiative in 1985 for leveraging NSF funds. The following description of the announcement of the ERC program in 1985 is illuminating:&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sciencegovreport1985&gt;Science and Government Report 15 (18), 4 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

"George A. Keyworth II, President's Reagan Science Advisor and Director of the [[Office of Science Technology Policy]], refers to the creation of the ERCs by the National Science Foundation as:
'the single most important thing that we've done as an Administration in increasing efficiency and effectiveness of federal R&amp;D dollars.'&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sciencegovreport1985&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He said the centers address a widely recognized need in various fields of science and technology: 
'Continued pushing of the frontiers in those fields was constrained by the difficulty of assembling multidisciplinary teams to work on the problems. Our universities are, justifiably and understandably, structured to pursue disciplinary research.  On the other hand, we increasingly find ourselves as a nation confronting the solving of problems that have technically based solutions. We need to expose our young people to a problem-solving environment....These Centers - I'd rather call them Science and Technology Centers - are multidisciplinary mechanism by which chemists, physicists, neurobiologists, engineers, etc, can get together and solve exciting, intellectually demanding, real-world problems.' "&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sciencegovreport1985&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

It was pointed out by [[William O. Baker]] that the above comments about the economic potential of the ERCs are nearly the same as those describing the original IDLs in the early 1960s.  Baker concludes that "it is refreshing indeed to find such current agreement on the concept that has involved so significant a portion of our best academic talent."&lt;ref name=baker&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The first six ERC awards were made in 1985. These awards are generally for five years with one other 5 year renewal possible for a total funding length of 10 years.&lt;ref name=ERCs&gt;Engineering Research Centers [https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5502 "National Science Foundation website"]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year NSF made five-year awards for five supercomputing centers and made plans for the development of a program for Science and Technology Centers (STCs) that would ultimately touch all areas of NSF programs. The first 11 STCs were established in 1988.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The 13 centers that are part of the 2013 class of STCs  cover a wide range of subjects ranging from studies of brain and intelligence to modeling of atmospheric processes to the study of quantum materials.&lt;ref name=STCs&gt;Science and Technology Centers [https://www.nsf.gov/od/oia/programs/stc/active_centers/ACTIVE.jsp "National Science Foundation website"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of concerns about the impact on center funding on individual investigator awards the [[National Science Board]] required that center awards cannot be renewed without  open recompetition.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since the establishment of ERCs and STCs a large number of other centers have been established across all major NSF disciplines and now represent an essential element of the NSF funding portfolio.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishment of MRSECs (1994 - 1996) ===

As can be seen from Table 1 the majority of MRLs were started between 1972 and 1984 with only a few later additions.  The MRL competition of 1992 led to the start of only one new center: the MRL at the University of California Santa Barbara. The lack of new awards, coupled with the National Science Board re-competition requirement, provided one impetus for the development of the NSF Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers (MRSEC) program. Previously, MRLs, once funded, could be continually supported without a need to compete against other center candidates. The MRSEC program limits awards to a fixed time period, currently six years.  Additional support is possible, but only on the basis of a new proposal that competes nationally against all other applicants.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The transition from the MRL to the MRSEC programs occurred through two competitions held in 1993/4 and 1995/96, respectively.  The competitions were open to all US academic institutions, including those with then current MRL awards. Institutions with awards made under the Materials Research Group (MRG) program, which was initiated at NSF in 1984, were eligible to participate in the competition. All MRL and MRG awards were discontinued after 1996. In all, 10 MRLs and 17 MRGs participated in the competitions of 1994-96. As seen in Table 2, nine of the MRLs were successful in transitioning to MRSECs, and six MRSEC awards went to institutions with prior MRG awards.  Importantly, new MRSEC awards were made to six institutions that never had any substantial NSF center or large group support in materials research.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

TABLE 2 Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers established after open competitions in 1994 and 1996. Those institutions with existing Materials Research Laboratories (MRLs) or Materials Research Groups (MRGs) in 1994 or 1996 are indicated, while "new" refers to institutions that did not have a current MRL or MRG award.  The MRL and MRG programs were discontinued after 1996.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent MRSEC competitions were held every two years (with a four-year award cycle) and, every three years starting in 2002 (with a six-year award cycle). The required open competition for any center that wishes to be supported for more than the initial six-year award period is consistent with the re-competition requirements set by the National Science Board.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Academy Study of MRSEC program (2007) ==

An assessment of the MRSEC program was published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2007.&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Executive Summary summarizes the impact of the program:

"MRSEC awards continue to be in great demand. The intense competition for them within the community indicates a strong perceived value."&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The report lists a number of key areas where the MRSEC program has an impact, including providing the resources and environment that fosters:&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* interdisciplinary, collaborative research;
* interdisciplinary training for the future scientific and technical workforce; 
* rapid response to new ideas, including support for higher-risk projects, than is possible with single-investigator  grants;	
* increased  institutional, local, and/or state support for materials research; 
* attraction of  high quality students and junior faculty;
* development of infrastructure helpful for organizing and managing experimental and computational facilities and educational and industrial outreach.

Among the report's recommendations are an increase in the grant size of the centers, which would allow adequate resources for education and outreach, while ensuring that the support for research activities is not compromised.  Recent MRSEC competitions&lt;ref name=nsfpress2010&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nsfpress2015&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; have responded to the recommendations by increasing award sizes, notably by requiring that each new award will support a minimum of two interdisciplinary research groups (IRGs). In addition, the NAS study recommends strengthening the cooperative aspects of MRSECs and continue the progress made in the past toward building a national cooperating network of centers.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The report concludes that such a network, once fully established, would  "strengthen materials science and engineering in the United States as a discipline and as a factor in U.S. competitiveness."&lt;ref name=nasmrsecreview2007&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5517">'''Modular constructivism''' is a style of [[sculpture]] that emerged in the 1950s and 1960s and was associated especially with [[Erwin Hauer]] and [[Norman Carlberg]]. It is based on carefully structured modules which allow for intricate and in some cases infinite patterns of repetition, sometimes used to create limitless, basically planar, screen-like formations, and sometimes employed to make more multidimensional structures. Designing these structures involves intensive study of the combinatorial possibilities of sometimes quite curvilinear and fluidly shaped modules, creating a seamless, quasi-organic unity that can be either rounded and self-enclosed, or open and potentially infinite. The latter designs have proved useful and attractive for use in eye-catching architectural walls and screens, often featuring complex patterns of undulating, tissue-like webbing, with apertures which transmit and filter light, while generating delicate patterns of shadow.

Writing in ''Architecture Week'' (August 4, 2004), Hauer explains that "Continuity and potential infinity have been at the very center of my sculpture from early on." [http://www.architectureweek.com/2004/0804/culture_2-2.html] Hauer made an extensive study of [[biomorphism|biomorphic]] form, especially what he calls "saddle surfaces," which combine convex and concave curvature and thus allow for smooth self-combination, sometimes in multiple dimensions. Another inspiration is the sculpture of [[Henry Moore]], with its fluid curves and porosity.

Hauer's enthusiasm caught the imagination of his colleague at [[Yale]], [[Norman Carlberg]]. Both were devoted students of the arch-formalist [[Josef Albers]]. Indeed, from the beginning, there was in this modular approach to sculpture an implicit [[formalism (art)|formalism]] and even [[minimalism]] which held itself aloof from some of the other artistic trends of the time, such as the [[pop art]] and [[post-modernism]] that were just beginning to emerge. As Carlberg recalls, within his artistic circle "you analysed, you looked at something, but you looked at it formally just for what it was and the message was almost always out of it."

'''Neurogenetics''' studies the role of [[genetics]] in the development and function of the [[nervous system]]. It considers neural characteristics as [[phenotype]]s (i.e. manifestations, measurable or not, of the genetic make-up of an individual), and is mainly based on the observation that the nervous systems of individuals, even of those belonging to the same [[species]], may not be identical. As the name implies, it draws aspects from both the studies of [[neuroscience]] and genetics, focusing in particular how the genetic code an organism carries affects its expressed [[Phenotypic trait|traits]]. [[Mutation]]s in this genetic sequence can have a wide range of effects on the quality of life of the individual. Neurological diseases, behavior and personality are all studied in the context of neurogenetics. The field of neurogenetics emerged in the mid to late 1900s with advances closely following advancements made in available technology. Currently, neurogenetics is the center of much research utilizing cutting edge techniques.

==History==
The field of neurogenetics emerged from advances made in molecular biology, genetics and a desire to understand the link between genes, behavior, the brain, and neurological disorders and diseases. The field started to expand in the 1960s through the research of [[Seymour Benzer]], considered by some to be the father of neurogenetics.&lt;ref name="Olypmians"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.caltech.edu/talk-archive/index.html|title=Olympians of Science: A Display of Medals and Awards |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=5 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Seymour Benzer.gif|thumb|Seymour Benzer in his office at Caltech in 1974 with a big model of Drosophila]] His pioneering work with ''[[Drosophila]]'' helped to elucidate the link between circadian rhythms and genes, which led to further investigations into other behavior traits. He also started conducting research in neurodegeneration in fruit flies in an attempt to discover ways to suppress neurological diseases in humans. Many of the techniques he used and conclusions he drew would drive the field forward.&lt;ref name="CalTech"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/13076 |title=Neurogenetics Pioneer Seymour Benzer Dies |publisher=California Institute of Technology |accessdate=5 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120073420/http://media.caltech.edu/press_releases/13076 |archivedate=20 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Early analysis relied on statistical interpretation through processes such as [[genetic linkage|LOD]] (logarithm of odds) scores of [[pedigree chart|pedigrees]] and other observational methods such as affected sib-pairs, which looks at phenotype and [[identity by descent|IBD]] (identity by descent) configuration. Many of the disorders studied early on including [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]], [[Huntington's disease|Huntington's]] and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) are still at the center of much research to this day.&lt;ref name=Gershon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gershon|first=Elliot S.|author2=Lynn R. Goldin|title=The outlook for linkage research in psychiatric disorders|journal=J. Psychiatr. Res.|year=1987|volume=21|issue=4|pages=541–550|pmid=3326940|doi=10.1016/0022-3956(87)90103-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1980s new advances in genetics such as [[recombinant DNA]] technology and [[reverse genetics]] allowed for the broader use of [[polymorphism (biology)|DNA polymorphisms]] to test for linkage between DNA and gene defects. This process is referred to sometimes as linkage analysis.&lt;ref name=Tanzi&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tanzi|first=R.E.|title=Genetic linkage studies of human neurodegenerative disorders|journal=Curr Opin Neurobiol|date=Oct 1991|volume=1|issue=3|pages=455–461|pmid=1840379|doi=10.1016/0959-4388(91)90069-J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenstein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenstein|first=P|author2=T.D.

Med.|date=Sep 1994|volume=161|issue=3|pages=242–245|pmid=7975561|pmc=1011404}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s ever advancing technology had made genetic analysis more feasible and available. This decade saw a marked increase in identifying the specific role genes played in relation to neurological disorders. Advancements were made in but not limited to: [[Fragile X syndrome]], Alzheimer’s, [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s]], [[epilepsy]] and ALS.&lt;ref name=Tandon&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tandon|first=P.N.|title=The decade of the brain: a brief review|journal=Neurol India|date=Sep 2000|volume=48|issue=3|pages=199–207|pmid=11025621}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological disorders==
While the genetic basis of simple diseases and disorders has been accurately pinpointed, the genetics behind more complex, neurological disorders is still a source of ongoing research. New developments such as the [[Genome-wide association study|genome wide association studies]] (GWAS) have brought vast new resources within grasp. With this new information genetic variability within the human population and possibly linked diseases can be more readily discerned.&lt;ref name=Simone-Sanchez&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simon-Sanchez|first=J|author2=A. Singleton|title=Genome-wide association studies in neurological disorders|journal=Lancet Neurol|year=2008|volume=7|pages=1067–1072|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(08)70241-2|pmid=18940696|issue=11|pmc=2824165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurodegenerative diseases are a more common subset of neurological disorders, with examples being [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]. Currently no viable treatments exist that actually reverse the progression of neurodegenerative diseases; however, neurogenetics is emerging as one field that might yield a causative connection. The discovery of linkages could then lead to therapeutic drugs, which could reverse brain degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=A|author2=Cookson MR|title=Role of LRRK2 kinase dysfunction in Parkinson disease|journal=Expert Rev Mol Med|date=June 2011|volume=13|issue=20|pmid=21676337|pages=e20|doi=10.1017/S146239941100192X|pmc=4672634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gene sequencing==
One of the most noticeable results of further research into neurogenetics is a greater knowledge of gene loci that show linkage to neurological diseases. The table below represents a sampling of specific gene locations identified to play a role in selected neurological diseases based on prevalence in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=PD /&gt;&lt;ref name=AD /&gt;&lt;ref name=MS /&gt;&lt;ref name=HD /&gt;

==Methods of research==

===Statistical analysis===
[[Genetic linkage|Logarithm of odds (LOD)]] is a statistical technique used to estimate the probability of gene linkage between traits. LOD is often used in conjunction with pedigrees, maps of a family’s genetic make-up, in order to yield more accurate estimations.  A key benefit of this technique is its ability to give reliable results in both large and small sample sizes, which is a marked advantage in laboratory research.&lt;ref&gt;N E Morton (1996). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC39633/journal.pmed.8622960 Logarithm of odds (lods) for linkage on complex inheritance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helms, Ted (2000) [http://www.ag.ndsu.nodak.edu/plantsci/adv_genetics/genetics/lod/lod02.htm Logarithm of Odds in Advanced Genetics].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Quantitative trait locus|Quantitative trait loci (QTL)]] mapping is another statistical method used to determine the chromosomal positions of a set of genes responsible for a given trait.  By identifying specific genetic markers for the genes of interest in a [[recombinant inbred strain]], the amount of interaction between these genes and their relation to the observed phenotype can be determined through complex statistical analysis.  
In a neurogenetics laboratory, the phenotype of a model organisms is observed by assessing the morphology of their brain through thin slices.&lt;ref&gt;R. W. Williams (1998) [http://www.nervenet.org/papers/shortcourse98.html Neuroscience Meets Quantitative Genetics: Using Morphometric Data to Map Genes that Modulate CNS Architecture].&lt;/ref&gt;  QTL mapping can also be carried out in humans, though brain morphologies are examined using [[Magnetic resonance imaging|nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)]] rather than brain slices. Human beings pose a greater challenge for QTL analysis because the genetic population cannot be as carefully controlled as that of an inbred recombinant population, which can result in sources of statistical error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bartley | first1 = AJ | last2 = Jones | first2 = DW | last3 = Weinberger | first3 = DR | year = 1997 | title = Genetic variability of human brain size and cortical gyral patterns | url = http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/120/2/257.full.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Brain | volume = 120 | issue = 2| pages = 257–269 | doi = 10.1093/brain/120.2.257 | pmid=9117373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recombinant DNA===
[[Recombinant DNA]] is an important method of research in many fields, including neurogenetics.  It is used to make alterations to an organism’s genome, usually causing it to over- or under-express a certain gene of interest, or express a mutated form of it.  The results of these experiments can provide information on that gene’s role in the organism’s body, and it importance in survival and fitness. The hosts are then screened with the aid of a toxic drug that the selectable marker is resistant to. The use of recombinant DNA is an example of a reverse genetics, where researchers create a mutant genotype and analyze the resulting phenotype.  In [[forward genetics]], an organism with a particular phenotype is identified first, and its genotype is then analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;Kuure-Kinsey, Matthew; McCooey, Beth (2006). [http://www.rpi.edu/dept/chem-eng/Biotech-Environ/Projects00/rdna/rdna.html The Basics of Recombinant DNA].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, Victor (2011). [http://wormbook.org/chapters/www_introreversegenetics/introreversegenetics.html Reverse Genetics].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal research===
[[File:Drosophila.jpg|thumb|Drosophila]][[File:Zebrafisch.jpg|thumb|Zebrafish]]
Model organisms are an important tool in many areas of research, including the field of neurogenetics.  By studying creatures with simpler nervous systems and with smaller genomes, scientists can better understand their biological processes and apply them to more complex organisms, such as humans.  Due to their low-maintenance and highly mapped genomes, mice, ''[[Drosophila]]'',&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer"&gt;Pfeiffer, Barret D, et al. (2008) [http://www.pnas.org/content/105/28/9715.full Tools for neuroanatomy and neurogenetics in ''Drosophila''].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Caenorhabditis elegans|''C. elegans'']]&lt;ref name="Rand"&gt;Rand, James B, Duerr, Janet S, Frisby, Dennis L (2000) [http://www.fasebj.org/content/14/15/2414.full.pdf Neurogenetics of vesicular transporters in ''C. elegans''].&lt;/ref&gt; are very common.  [[Zebrafish]]&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;Burgess, Harold A, Granato, Michael (2008) [http://bfg.oxfordjournals.org/content/7/6/474.short The neurogenetic frontier – lessons from misbehaving zebrafish].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[prairie vole]]s&lt;ref&gt;McGraw, Lisa A, Young, Larry J (2009) [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166223609001982 The prairie vole: and emerging model organism for understanding the social brain].&lt;/ref&gt; have also become more common, especially in the social and behavioral scopes of neurogenetics.

In addition to examining how genetic mutations affect the actual structure of the brain, researchers in neurogenetics also examine how these mutations affect cognition and behavior. One method of examining this involves purposely engineering model organisms with mutations of certain genes of interest. These animals are then classically conditioned to perform certain types of tasks, such as pulling a lever in order to gain a reward. The speed of their learning, the retention of the learned behavior, and other factors are then compared to the results of healthy organisms to determine what kind of an effect – if any – the mutation has had on these higher processes. The results of this research can help identify genes that may be associated with conditions involving cognitive and learning deficiencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbc.jhu.edu/research/posters.html Neurogenetics and Behavior Center. Johns Hopkins U, 2011. Web. 29 Oct. 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human research===
Many research facilities seek out volunteers with certain conditions or illnesses to participate in studies. Model organisms, while important, cannot completely model the complexity of the human body, making volunteers a key part to the progression of research. Along with gathering some basic information about medical history and the extent of their symptoms, samples are taken from the participants, including blood, [[cerebrospinal fluid]], and/or muscle tissue. These tissue samples are then genetically sequenced, and the genomes are added to current database collections. The growth of these data bases will eventually allow researchers to better understand the genetic nuances of these conditions and bring therapy treatments closer to reality. Current areas of interest in this field have a wide range, spanning anywhere from the maintenance of [[circadian rhythms]],&lt;ref&gt;Fu, Ying-Hui, and Louis Ptacek, dirs. "Research Projects."

==Behavioral neurogenetics==
&lt;!-- Behavioral neurogenetics and Behavioural neurogenetics redirect here --&gt;
{{Main|Behavioural genetics}}
Advances in [[molecular biology]] techniques and the species-wide [[Human Genome Project|genome project]] have made it possible to map out an individual's entire genome. Whether genetic or environmental factors are primarily responsible for an individual's personality has long been a topic of debate.&lt;ref name="Congdon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimura"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kimura |first1=Mitsuru |last2=Higuchi |first2=Susumu |title= Genetics of Alcohol Dependence |journal= Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=213–25 |year=2011 |type=Print |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1819.2011.02190.x |pmid=21507127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to the advances being made in the field of neurogenetics, researchers have begun to tackle this question by beginning to map out genes and correlate them to different personality traits.&lt;ref name="Congdon"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Congdon |first1=Eliza |last2=Canli |first2=Turhan |title= A Neurogenetic Approach to Impulsivity |journal= Journal of Personality |volume=76 |issue=6 |pages= 1447–84 |year=2008 |type=Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is little to no evidence to suggest that the presence of a ''single'' gene indicates that an individual will express one style of behavior over another; rather, having a specific gene could make one more predisposed to displaying this type of behavior.  It is starting to become clear that most genetically influenced behaviors are due to the effects of many variants within ''many'' genes, in addition to other neurological regulating factors like neurotransmitter levels.  Due to fact that many behavioral characteristics have been conserved across species for generations, researchers are able to use animal subjects such as mice and rats, but also fruit flies, worms, and zebrafish,&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rand"/&gt; to try to determine specific genes that correlate to behavior and attempt to match these with human genes.&lt;ref name="Reaume"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reaume |first1=Christopher J. |last2=Sokolowski |first2=Marla B. |title=Conservation of Gene Function in Behavior |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B]] |volume=366 |issue=1574 |pages=2100–2110 |year=2011 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2011.0028|pmc=3130371 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cross-species gene conservation===
While it is true that variation between species can appear to be pronounced, at their most basic they share many similar behavior traits which are necessary for survival. Such traits include mating, aggression, foraging, social behavior and sleep patterns. This conservation of behavior across species has led biologists to hypothesize that these traits could possibly have similar, if not the same, genetic causes and pathways. Studies conducted on the genomes of a plethora of organisms have revealed that many organisms have [[Homology (biology)|homologous genes]], meaning that some genetic material has been [[Conserved sequence|conserved]] between species.  If these organisms shared a common evolutionary ancestor, then this might imply that aspects of behavior can be inherited from previous generations, lending support to the genetic causes – as opposed to the environmental causes – of behavior.&lt;ref name="Kimura"/&gt; Variations in personalities and behavioral traits seen amongst individuals of the same species could be explained by differing levels of expression of these genes and their corresponding proteins.&lt;ref name="Reaume"/&gt;

===Aggression===
There is also research being conducted on how an individual's genes can cause varying levels of [[aggression]] and aggression control {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}.[[File:Mad dog.jpg|thumb|Outward displays of aggression are seen in most animals]] Throughout the animal kingdom, varying styles, types and levels of aggression can be observed leading scientists to believe that there might be a genetic contribution that has conserved this particular behavioral trait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zwarts|first=Liesbeth|last2=Magwire|first2=Michael M.|last3=Carbone|first3=Mary Anna|last4=Versteven|first4=Marijke|last5=Herteleer|first5=Liesbet|last6=Anholt|first6=Robert R.

==Development==
[[File:Shh Gradient In Neural Tube.svg|thumb|Shh and BMP gradient in the neural tube]] A great deal of research has been done on the effects of genes and the formation of the brain and the central nervous system. The following wiki links may prove helpful:

*[[Neural tube]]

There are many genes and proteins that contribute to the formation and development of the central nervous system, many of which can be found in the aforementioned links. Of particular importance are those that code for [[Bone morphogenetic protein|BMPs]], BMP inhibitors and [[Sonic hedgehog|''SHH'']]. When expressed during early development, BMP's are responsible for the differentiation of epidermal cells from the ventral [[ectoderm]]. Inhibitors of BMPs, such as [[Noggin (protein)|''NOG'']] and [[Chordin|''CHRD'']], promote differentiation of ectoderm cells into prospective neural tissue on the dorsal side. If any of these genes are improperly regulated, then proper formation and differentiation will not occur. 
BMP also plays a very important role in the patterning that occurs after the formation of the [[neural tube]]. Due to the graded response the cells of the neural tube have to BMP and Shh signaling, these pathways are in competition to determine the fate of preneural cells. BMP promotes dorsal differentiation of pre-neural cells into [[sensory neurons]] and Shh promotes ventral differentiation into [[motor neurons]]. There are many other genes that help to determine neural fate and proper development include, [[Reelin|''RELN'']], [[Sox9|''SOX9'']], [[Wnt signaling pathway|''WNT'']], [[Notch signaling pathway|Notch and Delta coding genes]], [[Hox gene|''HOX'']], and various cadherin coding genes like [[CDH1 (gene)|''CDH1'']] and ''[[CDH2]]''.&lt;ref name="Alberts"&gt;{{cite book |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |last= Alberts|edition=5th  |year=2008 |publisher=Garland Science |isbn=0-8153-4105-9 |pages=1139–1480 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some recent research has shown that the level of gene expression changes drastically in the brain at different periods throughout the life cycle.  For example, during prenatal development the amount of [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] in the brain (an indicator of gene expression) is exceptionally high, and drops to a significantly lower level not long after birth.  The only other point of the life cycle during which expression is this high is during the mid- to late-life period, during 50–70 years of age.  While the increased expression during the prenatal period can be explained by the rapid growth and formation of the brain tissue, the reason behind the surge of late-life expression remains a topic of ongoing research.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Sanders (2011).

==Current research==
Neurogenetics is a field that is rapidly expanding and growing.  The current areas of research are very diverse in their focuses.  One area deals with molecular processes and the function of certain proteins, often in conjunction with cell signaling and neurotransmitter release, cell development and repair, or neuronal plasticity.  Behavioral and cognitive areas of research continue to expand in an effort to pinpoint contributing genetic factors. As a result of the expanding neurogenetics field a better understanding of specific neurological disorders and phenotypes has arisen with direct correlation to [[Mutation|genetic mutations]]. With severe disorders such as [[epilepsy]], brain malformations, or [[mental retardation]] a single [[gene]] or causative condition has been identified 60% of the time; however, the milder the intellectual handicap the lower chance a specific genetic cause has been pinpointed. [[Autism]] for example is only linked to a specific, mutated gene about 15–20% of the time while the mildest forms of mental handicaps are only being accounted for genetically less than 5% of the time. Research in neurogenetics has yielded some promising results, though, in that mutations at specific gene loci have been linked to harmful phenotypes and their resulting disorders. For instance a [[frameshift mutation]] or a [[missense mutation]] at the [[Doublecortin|''DCX'' gene]] location causes a neuronal migration defect also known as [[lissencephaly]]. Another example is the ''[[ROBO3]]'' gene where a mutation alters [[axon]] length negatively impacting neuronal connections. Horizontal gaze palsy with progressive scoliosis (HGPPS) accompanies a mutation here.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walsh|first=C|author2=Engle E|title=Allelic diversity in human developmental neurogenetics: insights into biology and disease|journal=Neuron|year=2010|volume=68|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2010.09.042|pmid=20955932|issue=2|pages=245–53|pmc=3010396}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are just a few examples of what current research in the field of neurogenetics has achieved.&lt;ref&gt;"This Week In the Journal."

People living with '''HIV'''/'''AIDS''' face increased challenges in maintaining proper [[nutrition]]. Despite developments in medical treatment, nutrition remains a key component in managing this condition. The challenges that those living with [[HIV/AIDS]] face can be the result of the [[virus|viral]] infection itself or from the effects of anti-HIV therapy ([[HAART]]).&lt;ref&gt;Johansen, Diana. (2007). [http://www.catie.ca/ng_e.nsf/TOC/393B5A1F07881968852573750070AD0F?OpenDocument "Practical Guide to Nutrition for People Living with HIV"], ''Canadian Aids Treatment Information Exchange''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the side effects from HAART that may affect how the body absorbs and utilizes nutrients include [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]], [[nausea]], and poor appetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riddler | first1 = Sharon A | year = 2003 | title = Impact of HIV Infection and HAART on Serum Lipids in Men | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/289/22/2978 | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 289 | issue = 22| pages = 4–16 | doi = 10.1001/jama.289.22.2978 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
As well, the nutritional needs of people with HIV/AIDS are greater due to their [[immune system]] fighting off [[opportunistic infections]] that do not normally cause disease in people with healthy immune systems.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, Caspar (2010) retrieved from: [http://www.aidsmap.com/Opportunistic-infections/cat/1495/ "AIDS map"].&lt;/ref&gt; Medication along with proper nutrition is a major component of maintaining good health and quality of life for people living with HIV/AIDS.

==HIV/AIDS and nutritional needs==

===Energy requirements===
Monitoring caloric intake is important in ensuring that energy needs are met. For people with HIV/AIDS, energy requirements often increase in order to maintain their regular body weight.&lt;ref&gt;Parento, Joy. USDA(2009). Diet and Disease. Retrieved from http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=4&amp;tax_level=2&amp;tax_subject=278&amp;topic_id=1380&lt;/ref&gt; A classification system revised by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), categorizes HIV-infection into 3 clinical stages and addresses the suggested caloric requirements for each stage.&lt;ref&gt;Dean, E., Glynn H., House, A., et al. Association of Nutrition Service Agencies. (2002). Nutrition Guidelines For Agencies Providing Food to People with HIV. Retrieved from http://www.ansanutrition.org/uploads/documents/ansanutritionguides.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:1. Clinical Category A: Asymptomatic HIV
:This stage is characterized by Acute HIV. People in this category have estimated needs of 30-35 [[Kilocalorie|kcal]]s/[[kg]].
:2. Clinical Category B: Symptomatic HIV
:This stage is characterized by complications that arise from HIV symptoms. People in this category have estimated needs of 35-40 kcals/kg.
:3. Clinical Category C: Presence of AIDS condition
:This stage is characterized by having a [[T-cell]] count under 200, signaling the presence of an AIDS defining condition and/or an opportunistic infection. People in this category have estimated needs of 40–50 kcals/kg and are at an increased risk of malnourishment.

==Micronutrient requirements==

===Multivitamins and supplementation===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) issued consultative recommendations regarding nutrient requirements in HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name='WHO_nutrients'&gt;{{Cite book| last = [[World Health Organization]] | title = Nutrient requirements for people living with HIV/AIDS: Report of a technical consultation | date = May 2003 | location = Geneva | url = http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/Content_nutrient_requirements.pdf | isbn = | accessdate =March 31, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325030154/http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/Content_nutrient_requirements.pdf|archivedate=March 25, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A generally healthy diet was promoted. For HIV-infected adults, the WHO recommended micronutrient intake comes from a good diet at [[Reference Daily Intake|RDA]] levels; higher intake of vitamin A, [[zinc]], and iron can produce adverse effects in HIV positive adults, and these were not recommended unless there is documented deficiency.&lt;ref name='WHO_nutrients'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forrester|first=JE|author2=Sztam, KA|title=Micronutrients in HIV/AIDS: is there evidence to change the WHO 2003 recommendations?|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=December 2011|volume=94|issue=6|pages=1683S–1689S|pmid=22089440|doi=10.3945/ajcn.111.011999|pmc=3226021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nunnari"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Nunnari G, Coco C, Pinzone MR, Pavone P, Berretta M, Di Rosa M, Schnell M, Calabrese G, Cacopardo B |title=The role of micronutrients in the diet of HIV-1-infected individuals |journal=Front Biosci |volume=4 |issue= |pages=2442–56 |year=2012 |pmid=22652651 |doi= |url=https://www.bioscience.org/2012/v4e/af/556/fulltext.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeng"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Zeng L, Zhang L |title=Efficacy and safety of zinc supplementation for adults, children and pregnant women with HIV infection: systematic review |journal=Trop.

Despite the WHO recommendations, recent reviews have highlighted the absence of a simple consensus regarding the effects of [[multivitamins]] or [[micronutrient]] and nutrient supplementation on [[HIV-positive|HIV positive]] individuals. This is partly due to a lack of strong scientific evidence.&lt;ref name="Nunnari"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeng"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Visser|first=Marianne E.|last2=Durao|first2=Solange|last3=Sinclair|first3=David|last4=Irlam|first4=James H.|last5=Siegfried|first5=Nandi|date=2017|title=Micronutrient supplementation in adults with HIV infection|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=5|pages=CD003650|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003650.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmc=5458097|pmid=28518221|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some studies have looked into the use of implementing daily multivitamins into the diet regimens of HIV/AIDS patients. One study done in [[Tanzania]] involved a trial group with one thousand HIV positive pregnant women. Findings showed that daily multivitamins benefited both the mothers and their babies. After four years, the multivitamins were found to reduce the women’s risk of AIDS and death by approximately 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Fawzi WW et al., for the Tanzania Vitamin and HIV Infection Trial Team. Randomized trial

women in Tanzania. ''Lancet'' 1998; 351:1477-1482.&lt;/ref&gt; Another trial in [[Thailand]] revealed that the use of multivitamins led to fewer deaths, but only among people in advanced stages of HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Friis H | year = 2006 | title = Micronutrient interventions and HIV infection: a review of current evidence | url = | journal = Tropical medicine &amp; international health | volume = 11 | issue = 12| pages = 1849–57 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-3156.2006.01740.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all studies have provided a positive correlation. A small trial done in [[Zambia]] found no benefits from multivitamins after one month of use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Megazzini KM, Sinkala M, Vermund SH, Redden DT, Krebs DW, Acosta EP, Mwanza J, Goldenberg RL, Chintu N, Bulterys M, Stringer JS | year = 2010 | title = A cluster-randomized trial of enhanced labor ward-based PMTCT services to increase nevirapine coverage in Lusaka, Zambia | url = | journal = AIDS | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 447–455 | doi=10.1097/qad.0b013e328334b285 | pmid=19926959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding individual vitamin and mineral [[Dietary supplement|supplementation]], research shows mixed results. Vitamin A supplementation has been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity rates among African children suffering from HIV. The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends vitamin A supplements for all young children 6 to 59 months old that are at high risk of vitamin A [[Deficiency (medicine)|deficiency]] every 4 to 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization (WHO). (1998) [http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/1998/WHO_EPI_GEN_98.07.pdf "Integration of Vitamin A Supplementation with Immunization: Policy and Program Implications"].&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a trial from Tanzania found that the use of vitamin A supplements increased the risk of mother-to-child transmission by 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Coutsoudis A | title = The effects of vitamin A supplementation on the morbidity of children born to HIV-infected women | url = | journal = American Journal of Public Health | year = 1995 | volume = 85| issue = 8_Pt_1 | pages = 1076–1081 |display-authors=etal|doi=10.2105/ajph.85.8_pt_1.1076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Semba RD et al. Maternal vitamin A deficiency and mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1.
Lancet, 1994, 343:1593-1597.&lt;/ref&gt; With the inconsistency of these results, scientists have not reached a consensus regarding Vitamin A supplementation and its possible benefits for HIV/AIDS patients. Other vitamins to be taken by HIV-infected adults are [[vitamin C|vitamins C]] and [[vitamin E|E]].

Evidence for supplementation with [[selenium]] is mixed with some tentative evidence of benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stone|first=CA|author2=Kawai, K|author3=Kupka, R|author4=Fawzi, WW|title=Role of selenium in HIV infection|journal=Nutrition Reviews|date=November 2010|volume=68|issue=11|pages=671–81|pmid=20961297|doi=10.1111/j.1753-4887.2010.00337.x|pmc=3066516}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence that [[vitamin A]] supplementation in children reduces mortality and improves growth.&lt;ref name="Irlam"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irlam|first=JH|author2=Visser, MM|author3=Rollins, NN|author4=Siegfried, N|date=2010-12-08|editor1-last=Irlam|editor1-first=James H|title=Micronutrient supplementation in children and adults with HIV infection|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=12|pages=CD003650|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003650.pub3|pmid=21154354}}&lt;/ref&gt; For nutritionally compromised pregnant and lactating women, a [[multivitamin]] supplementation has improved outcomes for both mothers and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siegfried|first=Nandi|last2=Irlam|first2=James H.|last3=Visser|first3=Marianne E.|last4=Rollins|first4=Nigel N.|date=2012-03-14|title=Micronutrient supplementation in pregnant women with HIV infection|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=3|pages=CD009755|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009755|issn=1469-493X|pmid=22419344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, further research is required to determine the relationship between supplements and HIV/AIDS in order to develop effective nutritional interventions.

==Effects of HIV/AIDS on nutrition==
Statistics show that [[HIV/AIDS]] is most prevalent in the [[Sub-Saharan African]] region.&lt;ref name="avert.org"&gt;Regional statistics for HIV &amp; AIDS, end of 2008. (2008). Worldwide HIV and AIDS Statistics. Retrieved from http://www.avert.org/worldstats.htm&lt;/ref&gt; And according to the hunger map of 2010,&lt;ref&gt;FAO Hunger Map 2010. (2010). Food and Agricultural Organization. Retrieved from http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/es/Hunger_Portal/Hunger_Map_2010b.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; undernourishment is most prevalent in [[Asia-Pacific]] and, once again, in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Some of the reasons as to why there is a correlation between malnutrition and the presence of HIV/AIDS are listed below.

===Food security===
[[Food security]] is present "when all people at all times have access to sufficient, safe, nutritious food to maintain a healthy and active life", as defined by the World Food Summit of 1996. It is set on the basis of food availability, food access, and proper food use.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2010). Food Security. Retrieved from http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story028/en/&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty for some people suffering from HIV and AIDS involves how they must obtain food security because the virus increases fatigue, compromising their ability to work in order to provide food and food preparation. This impact is even greater on those living in poverty in rural areas, where providing food is largely based on farming and other household chores.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. (2006). HIV/AIDS and Food Security. Retrieved from http://www.fao.org/hivaids/impacts/food_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case study in Malawi====

In [[Malawi]], the AIDS epidemic and its effect on food security for 65 rural households was studied. Findings revealed that illness and death as a result of AIDS compromised household food security. 24 out of 65 households had negative food security indexes, meaning that they did not have enough flour and/or corn to meet their daily caloric requirements. Sharing of food and resources was substantially decreased to those families that were affected with HIV/AIDS, which proved especially detrimental in families that no longer had a prime adult. With the removal of a prime adult, these families were deprived of productive labor resulting in serious production deficiencies. The study concludes that family members victimized by AIDS led to fracturing of interpersonal ties with other families which created [[food insecurity]] in a community based on a rural [[subsistence]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;Mtika, MIke [http://www.malawi.pop.upenn.edu/Level%203/Papers/PDF-files/mtika-2001.pdf "The AIDS Epidemic in Malawi and It's Threat to Household Food Security"], ''Society for Applied Anthropology'', (60):2-2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Malnutrition===
[[File:Malnourished child.jpg|thumb|Child suffering from malnutrition&lt;ref&gt;Image uploaded to Wikimedia Commons by: Malnourishedtwat / Graeme Dott. Retrieved from: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Malnourished_child.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Malnutrition]] can be used as a measure of food insecurity and it has the most impact on those living in Sub-Saharan Africa and [[Asia-Pacific]], where [[poverty]] and [[malnutrition]] is most prevalent in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Undernourishment Around the World. (2009). The State of Food Insecurity in the World. Retrieved from ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/012/i0876e/i0876e02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It is also in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] where the cases of HIV/AIDS is most prevalent.&lt;ref name="avert.org"/&gt; An individual whose body is already compromised with HIV has an immune system even less effective at defending against infections when the body is malnourished. Anti-retroviral drugs are now being distributed to people in these areas but when given to those who are undernourished, the medicine’s effectiveness is decreased and toxicity is increased. Malnutrition accelerates the onset of the disease and give rise to repeated illnesses because of their weakened immune systems. Consequently, HIV and malnutrition provide a cyclic form of feedback for each other, with worsening conditions of malnutrition being linked to a more rapid onset of HIV.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, C. (2006). HIV/AIDS and Malnutrition Locked in "Vicious Cycle":International community working to address hunger among people with HIV/AIDS. America.gov. Retrieved from http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/October/20061016151256cmretrop0.9265253.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food safety==
''For other uses, see [[food safety]]''

People living with AIDS have impaired immune systems and therefore are more susceptible to infections and diseases due to foodborne pathogens. Food safety includes food handling, food preparation and food storage, all to be dealt with carefully to ensure safety from food-borne bacteria. Those that are more prevalent in people with AIDS include [[Salmonella]], which is the most common cause of illness, being 100 times more prevalent in AIDS patients than healthy individuals.&lt;ref&gt;At-Risk Populations: Food Safety for Persons with AIDS. (2006). United States Department of Agriculture: Food Safety and Inspection Service. Retrieved from http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Fact_Sheets/Food_Safety_for_Persons_with_AIDS/&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is [[Listeriosis]] caused by ''[[listeria monocytogenes]]'', with severe and often fatal consequences when encountered by a persons with AIDS. Simple measures can be used to increase food safety and prevent food-borne illnesses for those with affected with HIV/AIDS. Washing your hands, the food about to be prepared, kitchen utensils and kitchen surfaces is effective against bacterial growth. Keeping raw meat and cooked meat separate and cooking foods thoroughly, using a food thermometer to be sure. And lastly, storing leftover foods in the refrigerator within two hours to ensure minimal risk of [[food-borne]] illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Cichocki, Mark R.N. (2009). Food Safety Basics: Food Safety is the Key to Healthy Eating. About.com: AIDS/HIV. Retrieved from http://aids.about.com/od/nutrition/a/foodbasics.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
There are some areas of research that have either not been explored or researched in-depth that are related to the area of HIV/AIDS treatment.

===Food sustainability and agriculture===
With food security also having an impact in rural areas affected by HIV/AIDS, another area of research involves agriculture in subsistence economies. More specifically, in these areas where households affected by HIV/AIDS may suffer from food insecurity, focuses for future research may include looking into ways to improve agricultural practices in order to enhance the household [[food production]] of families where one or more adults suffer from HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2005). Macronutrients and HIV/AIDS: a review of current evidence. Retrieved from http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/Paper%20Number%201%20-%20Macronutrients.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partner Agencies==
[[File:Veteran family.jpg|thumb|A young Veteran family hold onto each other as they search for affordable housing.]]
Operation Sacred Trust began as a collaboration of service providers with "aligned missions who have come together to bring their unique experiences and expertise to serve 1,000 homeless and low-income Veteran and their family members in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, located in the heart of South Florida." The four initial OST partners, [[Carrfour Supportive Housing]], [[PAIRS Foundation]], Henderson Behavioral Health, and Neighborhood Housing Services of South Florida, brought combined experience of more than 100 years in the South Florida community serving homeless and other at-risk populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operationsacredtrust.com] - Operation Sacred Trust website.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2016, Operation Sacred Trust began operating as an independent agency with staff members provided by [[Carrfour Supportive Housing]], Purpose Built Families Foundation, and the University of Miami Health Law Clinic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.411Veterans.com] - 411Veterans.com website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
[[File:Veteran and son.jpg|thumb|A Veteran and his young son searching for affordable housing in Miami.]]
Funding for the Supportive Services for Veterans Families program was initially provided by the [[111th United States Congress]] through implementation of the provisions of section 604 of the Veterans’ Mental Health and Other Care Improvements Act of 2008, as published in the [[Federal Register]].&lt;ref name="gpo"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2010-11-10/pdf/2010-28407.pdf] - 38 CFR Part 62, Department of Veterans Affairs. From GPO website.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial grant that funded the program was $1 million annually. In 2013, funding from the VA was increased to $1.75 million annually with an additional $3 million provided for a three-year surge in Miami-Dade County in October 2014.&lt;ref name="ssvf"/&gt;

In total, between FY 2012 and 2017, the [[U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]], provided $28.8 million in grant funds to three unique Supportive Services for Veteran Families programs in Broward and Miami-Dade counties, including $12.1 million to Operation Sacred Trust (42%), $8.7 million to Advocate Program (30%), and $8 million to the United Way's Mission United initiative (28%).&lt;ref name="ssvf"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farray|first=Yanira|title=VA Awards $300 in SSVF Grants to Help End Veteran Homelessness|url=http://www.veteransnewsnow.com/2016/08/30/va-awards-300-in-ssvf-grants-to-help-end-veteran-homelessness/|publisher=Veteran News Now|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==
In order to receive services through Operation Sacred Trust, participants must be '''very low-income veteran families''' living in Florida's Broward or Miami-Dade counties who are either:&lt;ref name="gpo"/&gt;

{{wikisource}}
The '''Pact of Umar''' (also known as the '''Covenant of Umar''', '''Treaty of Umar''' or '''Laws of Umar'''; {{lang-ar|شروط عمر}} or {{lang|ar|عهد عمر}} or {{lang|ar|عقد عمر}}), is an [[apocryphal]] [[treaty]] between the [[Muslims]] and the [[Christians]] of either [[Syria]], [[Mesopotamia]],{{sfn|Roggema|2009|p=361}} or [[Jerusalem]]{{sfn|Meri|2005|p=205}} that later gained a canonical status in [[Islamic jurisprudence]]. It specifies rights and restrictions for non-Muslims ([[dhimmis]]) living under Islamic rule. 

There are several versions of the pact, differing both in structure and stipulations.{{sfn|Abu-Munshar|2007|p=63}} While the pact is traditionally attributed to the second [[Rashidun]] [[Caliph]] [[Umar|Umar ibn Khattab]],{{sfn|Thomas|Roggema|2009|p=360}} other jurists and orientalists have doubted this attribution{{sfn|Abu-Munshar|2007|p=63}} with the treaty being attributed to 9th century [[Mujtahid]]s (Islamic scholars) or the [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Umar II]]. This treaty should not be confused with [[Umar's Assurance| Umar's Assurance of safety to the people of Aelia]] (known as ''al-ʿUhda al-ʿUmariyya'', {{lang-ar|العهدة العمرية}}).

In general, the pact contains a list of rights and restrictions on non-Muslims ([[dhimmis]]). By abiding to them, non-Muslims are granted security of their persons, their families, and their possessions. Other rights and stipulations may also apply. According to [[Ibn Taymiyya]], one of the jurists who accepted the authenticity of the pact, the dhimmis have the right "to free themselves from the Covenant of 'Umar and claim equal status with the Muslims if they enlisted in the army of the state and fought alongside the Muslims in battle."&lt;ref name=Ipgrave&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Georgetown University Press| isbn = 1589017226| last = Ipgrave| first = Michael| title = Justice and Rights: Christian and Muslim Perspectives| year = 2009| page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and authenticity==
According to Abu-Munshar, the historical origin of the document may lie in an agreement made between the Muslim conquerors and the Christians of [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] or [[Damascus]] which was later extended to [[Dhimmi]]s elsewhere.{{sfn|Roggema|2009|p=361}}  He further writes that, "The humiliating conditions enumerated in the so-called “Pact of Umar” are utterly foreign to the mentality, thoughts and practices of this caliph...The deficiencies [in the textual integrity] support the contention that Umar was not the originator of the document."&lt;ref&gt;Maher Abu-Munshar, ''Islamic Jerusalem And Its Christians: A History of Tolerance And Tensions'', pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some Western historians suggest that the document was based on [[Umar's Assurance]], a treaty concluded between [[Umar|Umar ibn Khattab]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] following the [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|capture of Jerusalem]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] (637),{{sfn|Meri|2005|p=205}} while others believe the document was either the work of 9th century [[Ijtihad|Mujtahids]] or was forged during the reign of the [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Umar II]] (717-720),&lt;ref name=emon/&gt; with other clauses added later. Other scholars concluded that the document may have originated in immediate post-conquest milieu and was stylized by later historians.{{sfn|Roggema|2009|p=361}}

Western scholars' opinions varied about the Pact's authenticity. According to Anver M. Emon, "There is intense discussion in the secondary literature" about the Pact's authenticity, With scholars disagreeing on whether it might have originated during the reign of Umar b. al-Khattab or was "a later invention retroactively associated with Umar -- the caliph who famously led the initial imperial expansion -- to endow the contract of dhimma with greater normative weight?"&lt;ref name=emon&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emon|first1=Anver M.|title=Religious Pluralism and Islamic Law: Dhimmis and Others in the Empire of Law|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7MDyXu6bacC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=pact+of+umar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KnODVZXSK8u1-QHvp4H4Bg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pact%20of%20umar&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A.S. Tritton is one scholar who has "suggested that the Pact is a fabrication" because later Muslim conquerors did not apply its terms to their agreements with their non-Muslim subjects, which they would have if the pact had existed earlier. on the other hand Another scholar  Daniel C. Dennet  believes that the Pact was "no different from any other treaty negotiated in that period and that it is well within reason that the Pact we have today , as preserved in al-Tabari's chronicle is an authentic version of that early treaty."&lt;ref name=emon/&gt; Historian Abraham P. Bloch writes that, "Omar was a tolerant ruler, unlikely to impose humiliating conditions upon non-Muslims, or to infringe upon their religious and social freedoms.  His name has been erroneously associated…with the restrictive Covenant of Omar."&lt;ref&gt;Abraham P. Bloch, ''One a Day: An Anthology of Jewish Historical Anniversaries for Every Day of the Year'', p. 314. {{ISBN|0881251089}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thomas Walker Arnold]], the pact "is in harmony" with Umar's "kindly consideration for his subjects of another faith,&lt;ref name="ArnoldPoI3"&gt;{{cite book

The book ''Classical Islam: a Sourcebook of Religious Literature'', quotes a version of the Pact from ''[[Kitab al-Umm]]'' of [[al-Shafi'i]] (d.204/820) that it says may be "a forerunner to the later document which gained something of a canonical status, making it applicable in many locations ..."&lt;ref name=CIS-138&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Calder|editor1-first=Norman|editor2-last=Mojaddedi,|editor2-first=Jawid|editor3-last=Rippin|editor3-first=Andrew|title=Classical Islam: A Sourcebook of Religious Literature|publisher=Routledge.|page=138|date=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgLslcH9U0IC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=pact+of+umar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TIaDVb3ULOrLsAT1jJmICw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=pact%20of%20umar&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personalization''', broadly known as '''customization''', consists of tailoring a service or a product to accommodate specific individuals, sometimes tied to groups or segments of individuals.  A wide variety of organizations use personalization to improve [[customer satisfaction]], digital sales conversion, marketing results, branding, and improved website metrics as well as for [[advertising]]. Personalization is a key element in [[social media]] and [[recommender system]]s.

==Digital media and internet==
Another aspect of personalization is the increasing prevalence of [[open data]] on the Web. Many companies make their data available on the Web via [[API]]s, web services, and [[open data]] standards. One such example is Ordnance Survey Open Data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2010/apr/02/ordnance-survey-open-data | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Chris | last1=Thorpe | first2=Simon | last2=Rogers | title=Ordnance Survey opendata maps: what does it actually include? | date=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data made available in this way is structured to allow it to be inter-connected and re-used by third parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/372363/Google_Opens_Up_Data_Center_For_Third_Party_Web_Applications |title=Google Opens Up Data Centre for Third Party Web Applications |publisher=Cio.com |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data available from a user's personal [[social graph]] can be accessed by third-party [[application software]] to be suited to fit the personalized [[web page]] or [[information appliance]].

Current [[open data]] standards on the Web include:
# Attention Profiling Mark-up Language (APML)
# DataPortability
# [[OpenID]]
# [[OpenSocial]]

===Web pages===
[[Web page]]s can be personalized based on the characteristics (interests, social category, context, etc.), actions (click on button, open a link, etc.), intent (make a purchase, check status of an entity), or any other parameter that can be identified and associated with an individual, therefore providing them with a tailored user experience.  Note that the experience is rarely simply accommodation of the user but a relationship between the user and the desires of the site designers in driving specific actions to achieve objectives (e.g. Increase sales conversion on a page).  The term ''customization'' is often used when the site only uses explicit data such as product ratings or user preferences.

Technically, web personalization can be achieved by associating a visitor segment with a predefined action. Customizing the user experience based on behavioural, contextual and technical data is proven to have a positive impact on conversion rate optimization efforts. Associated actions can range from changing the content of a webpage, presenting a modal display, presenting interstitials, triggering a personalized email or even automating a phone call to the user.

According to a 2014 study from research firm Econsultancy, less than 30% of [[e-commerce]] websites have invested in the field of web personalization. However, many companies now offer services for web personalization as well as web and email recommendation systems that are based on personalization or anonymously-collected user behaviours.&lt;ref name=behaviours&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703294904575385532109190198 ''Wall Street Journal'', "On the Web's Cutting Edge, Anonymity in Name Only"], August 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many categories of web personalization including
# Behavioral
# Contextual
# Technical
# Historic data
# Collaboratively filtered

There are several camps in defining and executing web personalization.  A few broad methods for web personalization may include:
# Implicit
# Explicit
# Hybrid

With implicit personalization, the web personalization is performed based on the different categories mentioned above. It can also be learned from direct interactions with the user based on implicit data, such as items purchased or pages viewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flynn|first1=Lawrence|title=5 Things To Know About Siri And Google Now's Growing Intelligence|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2014/07/08/5-things-to-know-about-siri-and-google-nows-growing-intelligence/|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; With explicit personalization, the web page (or information system) is changed by the user using the features provided by the system. Hybrid personalization combines the above two approaches to leverage the ''best of both worlds''.

Web personalization is can be linked to the notion of [[Adaptive hypermedia]] (AH). The main difference is that the former would usually work on what is considered an "open corpus hypermedia," whilst the latter would traditionally work on "closed corpus hypermedia." However, recent research directions in the AH domain take both closed and open corpus into account. Thus, the two fields are closely inter-related.

Personalization is also being considered for use in less overtly commercial applications to improve the user experience online.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Bowen|Bowen, J.P.]] and Filippini-Fantoni, S., [http://www.archimuse.com/mw2004/papers/bowen/bowen.html Personalization and the Web from a Museum Perspective]. In [[David Bearman]] and Jennifer Trant (eds.), ''[[Museums and the Web]] 2004: Selected Papers from an International Conference'', Arlington, Virginia, USA, 31 March – 3 April 2004. Archives &amp; Museum Informatics, pages 63–78, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Internet activist [[Eli Pariser]] has documented that search engines like [[Google]] and [[Yahoo! News]] give different results to different people (even when logged out). He also points out social media site [[Facebook]] changes user's friend feeds based on what it thinks they want to see. Pariser warns that these algorithms can create a "[[filter bubble]]" that prevents people from encountering a diversity of viewpoints beyond their own, or which only presents facts which confirm their existing views.

On an [[intranet]] or [[B2E]] [[Web portal#Enterprise Web portals|Enterprise Web portals]], personalization is often based on user attributes such as department, functional area, or role. The term "customization" in this context refers to the ability of users to modify the page layout or specify what content should be displayed.

=== Map personalization ===
{{Expand section|date=September 2015}}Digital [[Web mapping|web maps]] are also being personalized. [[Google Maps]] change the content of the map based on previous searches and other profile information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Next Frontier For Google Maps Is Personalization|url = https://techcrunch.com/2013/02/01/the-next-frontier-for-google-maps-is-personalization/|website = TechCrunch|accessdate = 2015-09-13|first = Frederic|last = Lardinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Technology writer [[Evgeny Morozov]] has criticized map personalization as a threat to [[public space]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = My Map or Yours?|url = http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2013/05/google_maps_personalization_will_hurt_public_space_and_engagement.html|newspaper = Slate|date = 2013-05-28|access-date = 2015-09-13|issn = 1091-2339|language = en|first = Evgeny|last = Morozov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobile phones ===

Over time mobile phones have seen an increased emphasis placed on user personalization. Far from the black and white screens and monophonic ringtones of the past, phones now offer interactive wallpapers and MP3 [[truetone]]s. In the UK and Asia, [[WeeMee]]s have become popular. WeeMees are three-dimensional characters that are used as wallpaper and respond to the tendencies of the user. [[Video Graphics Array]] (VGA) picture quality allows people to change their background with ease without sacrificing quality. All of these services are downloaded through the provider with the goal to make the user feel [[Mobile phone overuse|connected]] to the phone.&lt;ref&gt;May, Harvey, and Greg Hearn. "The Mobile Phone as Media." International Journal of Cultural Studies 8.2 (2005): 195-211. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Print media and merchandise ==
{{main|Mail merge}}

In print media, ranging from [[magazine]]s to [[admail|promotional publication]]s, personalization uses databases of individual recipients' information. Not only does the written document address itself by name to the reader, but the advertising is targeted to the recipient's demographics or interests using fields within the database, such as "first name", "last name", "company", etc.

The term "personalization" should not be confused with variable data, which is a much more granular method of marketing that leverages both images and text with the medium, not just fields within a database. Although personalized children's books are created by companies who are using and leveraging all the strengths of [[variable data printing|variable data printing (VDP)]]. This allows for full image and text variability within a printed book.
With the advent of online 3D printing services such as Shapeways and Ponoko we are seeing personalization enter into the realms of product design.

=== Promotional merchandise ===
Promotional items ([[mug]]s, [[T-shirt]]s, [[keychain]]s, [[ball]]s etc.) are regularly personalized. Personalized children's storybooks—wherein the child becomes the [[protagonist]], with the name and image of the child personalized—are also popular. Personalized CDs for children also exist. With the advent of [[digital printing]], personalized calendars that start in any month, birthday cards, cards, e-cards, posters and photo books can also be obtained.

=== 3D printing ===
[[3D printing]] is a production method that allows to create unique and personalized items on a global scale. Personalized apparel and accessories, such as jewellery, are increasing in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewellermagazine.com/Article.aspx?id=2167&amp;h=New-jewellery-website-targets-|title=New jewellery website targets 'customisers'|last=Weinman|first=Aaron|date=21 February 2012|publisher=Jeweller Magazine|language=|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of customization is also relevant in other areas like [[consumer electronics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.3ders.org/articles/20160121-philips-launches-worlds-first-personalized-3d-printed-face-shaver-for-limited-edition-run.html|title=Philips launches the world's first personalized, 3D printed face shaver for limited edition run|website=3ders.org|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[retail]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://twikblog.twikit.com/belgian-3d-company-twikit-brings-3d-customization-french-retail/|title=Twikit brings 3D customization to French retail.|website=Twikit Blog {{!}} 3D Customization, 3D Printing|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; By combining 3D printing with complex software a product can easily be customized by an end-user.

==Role of customers==

=== Mass personalization ===

{{tone|section|date=January 2011}}

Mass personalization is defined as custom tailoring by a company in accordance with its end users tastes and preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/personalization&amp;r=67 |title=personalize: Definition, Synonyms from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; From collaborative engineering perspective, mass customization can be viewed as collaborative efforts between customers and manufacturers, who have different sets of priorities and need to jointly search for solutions that best match customers' individual specific needs with manufacturers' customization capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, S., Y. Wang and M. M. Tseng. 2009. Mass Customization as a Collaborative Engineering Effort. International Journal of Collaborative Engineering, 1(2): 152-167&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P. Sengottuvelan, R. Lokeshkumar, T. Gopalakrishnan, "An Improved Session Identification Approach in Web Log Mining for Web Personalization," Journal of Internet Technology, vol. 18, no. 4 , pp. 723-730, Jul. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The main difference between mass customization and mass personalization is that customization is the ability for a company to give its customers an opportunity to create and choose product to certain specifications, but does have limits.&lt;ref&gt;Haag et al., ''Management Information Systems for the Information Age'', 3rd edition, 2006, page 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of mass personalization: 
A website knowing a user's location and buying habits will offer suggestions tailored to that user's demographics. Each user is classified by some relevant trait (location, age, and so forth) and then given personalization aimed at that group. This means that the personalization is not individual to that singular user, it only pinpoints a specific trait that matches them up with a larger group of people. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/9808015/How-supermarkets-prop-up-our-class-system.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Harry | last=Wallop | title=How supermarkets prop up our class system | date=2013-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Behavioral targeting]] represents a concept that is similar to mass personalization.

=== Predictive personalization ===

Predictive personalization is defined as the ability to predict customer behavior, needs or wants - and tailor offers and communications very precisely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/jwtintelligence/jwt-10-trends-for-2013-executive-summary|title=10 Trends for 2013 Executive Summary: Definition, Projected Trends |publisher=JWTIntelligence.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Social data is one source of providing this predictive analysis, particularly social data that is structured.  Predictive personalization is a much more recent means of personalization and can be used well to augment current personalization offerings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7636">'''Philosophical counseling''', also sometimes called '''philosophical practice''', is a contemporary movement in [[practical philosophy]].  Developing since the 1980s, practitioners of philosophical counseling ordinarily have a doctorate or minimally a master's degree in philosophy and offer their philosophical counseling or consultation services to clients who look for a philosophical understanding of their lives, social problems, or even mental problems. In the last case philosophical counseling might be in lieu of, or in conjunction with, traditional [[psychotherapy]]. The movement has often been said to be rooted in the [[Socrates|Socratic tradition]], which viewed philosophy as a search for the Good and the good life. A life without [[philosophy]] was not worth living for Socrates.

==History ==
Peter Koestenbaum at San Jose State University in California was an early figure in Philosophical Counseling. His 1978 book ''The New Image of the Person: The Theory and Practice of Clinical Philosophy'' set out the essential contributions of philosophy to counseling. His own practice was augmented by extensive training of mental health professionals in applications of philosophical principles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pib.net/bio_peter.htm | accessdate=2014-05-15&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's oldest association of philosophical counseling and practice appears to be the German Society for Philosophical Practice and Counseling, which was founded in 1982 by the German philosopher, [[Gerd B. Achenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://sites.google.com/site/thephilosophicalcounselingweb/home/ |title= The Philosophical Practice and Counseling Website|author= Center Sophon|accessdate= 2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the oldest association of philosophical counseling and practice appears to be the National Philosophical Counseling Association (NPCA), formerly called the American Society for Philosophy, Counseling, and Psychotherapy, which was co-founded in 1992 by three American philosophers, Elliot D. Cohen, Paul Sharkey, and Thomas Magnell. The NPCA offers a primary certificate in [[logic-based therapy]] (LBT) through the Institute of Critical Thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.npcassoc.org/ |title= National Philosophical Counseling Association - Official Website | accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Philosophical Practitioners Association (APPA) was founded in 1998 in New York City by Professor Lou Marinoff.  APPA offers a certification program in client counseling for those with advanced degrees in philosophy who wish to practice philosophical counseling.  It also publishes a professional Journal and has a membership list of those certified as philosophical counselors on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.appa.edu/ |title= American Philosophical Practitioners Association - Official Website | accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marinoff was at the center of a 2004 controversy when his philosophical counseling practice at [[City College of New York]] was temporarily shuttered by college officials who feared he was offering mental health advice without proper training and licensing; Marinoff responded by suing for what he described as his [[freedom of speech]] being stifled.&lt;ref name=Duane2004/&gt;

There are presently a number of professional associations for philosophical counseling throughout the world, including France, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Greece, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Poland, Finland, Luxembourg, Israel, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Brazil, Portugal, Korea, Turkey, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and the United States.

==Goals and methods==
According to the Preamble of the NPCA Standards of Practice,
:a philosophical practitioner helps clients to clarify, articulate, explore and comprehend philosophical aspects of their belief systems or world views....Clients may consult philosophical practitioners for help in exploring philosophical problems related to such matters as mid-life crises, career changes, stress, emotions, assertiveness, physical illness, death and dying, aging, meaning of life, and morality. On the other side philosophical practitioners also initiate projects in common life worlds with various goals that are related to essential problems of life, such as sustainable energy, direct democracy, etc. 
Activities common to philosophical practice include:
# the examination of clients' arguments and justifications
# the clarification, analysis, and definition of important terms and concepts
# the exposure and examination of underlying assumptions and logical implications
# the exposure of conflicts and inconsistencies
# the exploration of traditional philosophical theories and their significance for client issues
# the initiation of projects for common goods 
# all other related activities that have historically been identified as philosophical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://npcassoc.org/documents/ |title= Standards of Practice|author= ASPCP|accessdate= 2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methods and orientations of philosophical counselors vary greatly. Some practitioners, such as [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] (Germany), [[Michel Weber]] (Belgium) and [[Shlomit C. Schuster]] (Israel) are dialogical and dialective engaged, while confessing to a "beyond method" approach. They hold that philosophical counseling has the aim to empower clients' philosophical abilities, which additionally may have therapeutic implications.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster, S.C. (1999). [http://www.abc-clio.com/product.aspx?id=2147498636 ''Philosophy Practice: An Alternative to Counseling and Psychotherapy''.] Westport, CT:[[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]]; cf. [[Michel Weber]]'s own blend of [https://chromatika.academia.edu/MichelWeber praxis].&lt;/ref&gt;  "Others are directive oriented and view philosophical counseling as a form of mental health intervention".&lt;ref&gt;Raabe, P. (2001). ''Philosophical Counseling.'' Westport, CT: [[Praeger Publishers|Praeger]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophical practitioners, notably Louis Marinoff (U.S.) and Guenther Witzany (Austria), view philosophical practice as a separate practice area distinct from mental health practices such as psychology and mental health counseling;&lt;ref&gt;Guenther Witzany (ed) (1991). Zur Theorie der Philosophischen Praxis. Essen. {{ISBN|3-89206-407-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while others, notably Elliot D. Cohen (U.S.), think they are necessarily intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://npcassoc.org/journal/table-of-contents/vol-2-no-2/ |title= Philosophy with Teeth:  The Wedding of Philosophical and Psychological Practices|author= Elliot D. Cohen|accessdate= 2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some philosophical counselors draw inspiration from the [[anti-psychiatry]] movement, arguing that widespread mental health diagnostic criteria as outlined in [[DSM IV]] have unfairly or inaccurately [[psychopathology|pathologized]] humanity.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Z. Kotkowicz (1997). ''R.D. Laing and the Paths of Anti-Psychiatry'', NY: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a ''New York Times'' article on philosophical counseling, "only Cohen and Marinoff have branded easily comprehended techniques. Cohen's [[logic-based therapy]] builds on the work of his mentor [[Albert Ellis]], who invented [[rational emotive behavior therapy]]."&lt;ref name=Duane2004&gt;{{cite news |last=Duane |first=Daniel |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/21/magazine/the-socratic-shrink.html?src=pm |title= The Socratic Shrink |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=2004-03-21 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major purpose of the program is to maintain an overall balance to space exploration, where, at a given year the focus may shift to one target of interest, over time-scales of 10 to 15 years the general direction and scope of the programs goes in the desired way.&lt;ref name = "strategy 1986–1996"/&gt;

==2013–2022, Visions and Voyages for Planetary Science==
''Visions and Voyages for Planetary Science in the Decade 2013 – 2022 (2011)'' was published in prepublication form on March 7, 2011,&lt;ref name="nasa2013" /&gt; and in final form later that year.&lt;ref name= "NAP" /&gt; Draft versions of the document were presented at town hall meetings around the country, at lunar and planetary conferences, and made available publicly on the NASA website and via the National Academies Press.&lt;ref name=nasa2013 /&gt; The report differed from previous reports in that it included "brutally honest" budgetary review from a 3rd party contractor.

The report highlighted a new Mars rover, a mission to Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], and a mission to [[Uranus]] and its moons as proposed [[Flagship Program|Flagship Missions]].&lt;ref name=zab/&gt; The Mars mission was given highest priority, followed by the Europa mission.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.livestream.com/2011lpsc/video?clipId=pla_18e48f98-4a78-4acc-ad2a-29c7a8ae326c&lt;/ref&gt; The Mars rover proposal was called [[Mars Astrobiology Explorer Cacher|MAX-C]] and it would store samples for eventual return to Earth, but the method of return was left open.&lt;ref name=zab&gt;{{cite news|title=Lean U.S. missions to Mars, Jupiter moon recommended|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/08/us-space-usa-future-idUSTRE7266XJ20110308|work=7 March 2011|publisher=Reuters|date=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It only recommended the rover mission if it could be done cheaply enough (2.5 billion USD).&lt;ref name=zab/&gt;

The committee producing the survey was led by [[Steve Squyres]] of Cornell University and included 5 panels focusing on the [[Terrestrial planet|inner planets]] ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], and the [[Moon]]), [[Mars]] (not including [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]]), the [[gas giant]] planets, satellites ([[Galilean satellites]], [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], and other satellites of the giant planets) and [[Asteroid|primitive bodies]]  (Asteroids, comets, [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]], [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]], [[Pluto]]/[[Charon (moon)|Charon]] and other [[Kuiper belt object]]s, [[meteorite]]s, and [[interplanetary dust]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Planetary Exploration 2013–2022: Scientists are ready, what about you?|first1=Kunio M.|last1=Sayanagi|work=[[ArsTechnica]]|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/03/planetary-exploration-2013-2022-scientists-are-ready-what-about-you.ars|date=March 14, 2011|accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earlier NASA Planetary Science Surveys and studies of direction==

===2003–2013, New Frontiers in the Solar System===
[[File:Europa Rising.jpg|thumb|230px|Jupiter and Europa as viewed by New Horizons in 2007]]
The previous study, ''New Frontiers in the Solar System: An Integrated  Exploration Strategy 2003–2013'' was published by the National Academies Press, in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=10432 New Frontiers in the Solar System: An Integrated  Exploration Strategy 2003–2013, National Academies Press]&lt;/ref&gt; The committee producing the survey was led by [[Michael J. Belton]].  The 5 panels focused on the [[Terrestrial planet|inner planets]], [[Mars]], the Giant planets, Large satellites and [[Astrobiology]].  The survey placed heavy emphasis on Mars exploration including the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s, established of the [[New Frontiers program]] including [[New Horizons]] mission to study Pluto and established programs in power and propulsion to lay a technological basis for programs in later decades including manned missions beyond Earth orbit.

===1995 to 2015, Space Science in the Twenty-First Century, Imperatives for the Decades===
While not titled as a decadal survey, a planetary science plan covering 1995–2015 was published by the Space Studies Board.  The report recommended a focus on "[[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]]-like missions to study Saturn, Uranus and Neptune" including a mission to rendezvous with Saturn's rings and study of Titan.  It also recommended study of the moon with a "[[Lunar Geoscience Orbiter]]", a network of lunar rovers and sample return from the lunar surface.  The report recommended a [[Mercury Orbiter]] to study not only that planet but provide some solar study as well.  A "Program of Extensive Study of Mars" beginning with [[Mars Pathfinder]] mission was planned for 1995 to be followed up by one in 1998 to return samples to Earth for study.  Study of primitive bodies such a comet or asteroid was recommended as a flyby mission of [[List of Apollo asteroids|Apollo]] and [[Amor asteroid]].&lt;ref name="1988 Decadal"&gt;{{cite book|title=Space Science in the Twenty-First Century – Imperatives for the Decades 1995 to 2015|year=1988|publisher=Space Studies Board|isbn=978-0-309-03885-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1965, Wood's Hole Study===
[[File:NASA Apollo 17 Lunar Roving Vehicle.jpg|thumb|Apollo 17's lunar roving vehicle, 1972]]
In the summer of 1965 the Space Science Board reviewed lunar and planetary science opportunities.&lt;ref name=ssb1968/&gt; Space exploration, astronomy, and the humans in space were major topics.&lt;ref name=compton&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4214/ch3-6.html#source42  Chapter 3 of NASA SP-4214]&lt;/ref&gt; These meetings brought together major ideas like the Grand tour, study of the outer planets and sun, and large space telescopes and there additional Woods hole meetings in 1969 and 1970 that influenced some of the large projects of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Butrica|first1=Andrew J.|title=Voyager: The Grand Tour of Big Science|url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter11.html|website=history.nasa.gov|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study also showed signs of how the scientific community began to siphon the public's excitement about the manned exploration of space into more eccentric scientific projects, marking a shift from a more supportive role to actually taking the place of manned exploration.&lt;ref name="woods hole"&gt;{{cite web|title=Where No Man Has Gone Before, Ch3-6|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4214/ch3-6.html|website=www.hq.nasa.gov|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study marked a distinction between manned and unmanned missions, laying the foundation for a collision between two concepts in which scientists would explore the solar system from Earth using unmanned vehicles because that, rather than human exploration as an end in and of itself supported by science.&lt;ref name="woods hole"/&gt; Without boots on the ground public interest collapsed leaving astronauts purpose to be doing even more science experiments.&lt;ref name="woods hole"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4729">[[Plant]] [[root]] systems can grow to be complex due to a variety of [[species]] and [[microorganism]]s existing in a common [[soil]]. Plants have adapted to respond to the soil conditions and presence of [[microorganism|microbes]] through various mechanisms, one of which is the [[secretion]] of root [[exudate]]s. This secretion allows plants to largely influence the [[rhizosphere]] as well as the organisms that exist within it. The contents of exudates and the amount of substance released is reliant on multiple factors, including the root system architecture,&lt;ref name=Badri &gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-3040.2009.01926.x | title = Regulation and function of root exudates | journal = Plant, Cell &amp; Environment | volume = 32 | issue = 6 | pages = 666 | year = 2009 | last1 = Badri | first1 = Dayakar V | last2 = Vivanco | first2 = Jorge M }}&lt;/ref&gt; presence of harmful microbes, and [[metal toxicity]].

The contents may include [[ion]]s, [[compounds of carbon|carbon-based compound]]s, [[amino acid]]s, [[sterol]]s, and many other chemical compounds. At sufficient [[concentration]]s, exudates are capable of mediating{{clarify|date=June 2018}} both positive and negative plant-plant&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and plant-microbe interactions.

The physiological mechanism by which exudates are released is not entirely understood and varies depending on the [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] as well as the contents of the secreted exudate. Various types of root cells&lt;ref name=Badri/&gt; have been suggested to sense microbes or compounds in the soil and secrete exudates accordingly. One example of root exudation occurs when plants sense [[elicitor]]s and prime{{clarify|date=June 2018}} for a stress or defense response.{{clarify|date=June 2018}}&lt;ref name=Badri/&gt; It is believed that elicitors, such as methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid, are sensed by receptors on root cap cells, often referred to as border cells.&lt;ref name=Badri/&gt; This induces a change in [[regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]], up-regulating specific defense or stress-response genes. This differential [[gene expression]] results in [[metabolism|metabolic]] changes that ultimately result in the [[biosynthesis]] of primary and secondary metabolites. These metabolites exit cells in the form of exudates through [[transport protein|transporters]] that vary depending on the chemical structure of the metabolites.&lt;ref name=Badri/&gt; The exudate secretion is then able to elicit a defense response against harmful microbes within the soil.

A specific experiment explored the role of root exudates in [[kin recognition]] in ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. The researchers grew young [[seedling]]s in liquid media that contained exudates from either themselves, [[sibling]]s, or non-siblings.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2881236| year = 2010| author1 = Biedrzycki| first1 = M. L| title = Root exudates mediate kin recognition in plants| journal = Communicative &amp; Integrative Biology| volume = 3| issue = 1| pages = 28–35| last2 = Jilany| first2 = T. A| last3 = Dudley| first3 = S. A| last4 = Bais| first4 = H. P}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then assessed root length as well as the number of [[lateral roots]] that the seedlings produced in the different treatment groups. They found that ''Arabidopsis'' seedlings grown in non-sibling exudates produced more lateral roots compared to those grown in exudates of kin or self-origin.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Additionally, roots appeared to grow shorter when grown in non-sibling exudates. These results suggest that the ''Arabidopsis'' seedlings were capable of [[detection|detecting]] the exudates around them and responding accordingly.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; Researchers speculate that this ability may be beneficial for fitness, allowing plants to allocate fewer resources to competition when grown amongst kin. 
	
While there is a legitimate current understanding of root exudates, further research and experimentation is still necessary to fully understand these mechanisms and how they may differ depending on the contents of exudates.

In [[computing]], a [[computer program]] or [[subroutine]] is called '''reentrant''' if it can be interrupted in the middle of its execution and then safely be called again ("re-entered") before its previous invocations complete execution. The interruption could be caused by an internal action such as a jump or call, or by an external action such as an [[interrupt]] or [[signal (computing)|signal]]. Once the reentered invocation completes, the previous invocations will resume correct execution.

This definition originates from single-threaded programming environments where the flow of control could be interrupted by an [[interrupt]] and transferred to an [[interrupt service routine]] (ISR). Any subroutine used by the ISR that could potentially have been executing when the interrupt was triggered should be reentrant. Often, subroutines accessible via the operating system [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] are not reentrant. Hence, interrupt service routines are limited in the actions they can perform; for instance, they are usually restricted from accessing the file system and sometimes even from allocating memory.

This definition of reentrancy differs from that of [[thread-safety]] in multi-threaded environments. A reentrant subroutine can achieve thread-safety,{{sfn|Kerrisk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SAQAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA657 657]}} but being reentrant alone might not be sufficient to be thread-safe in all situations. Conversely, thread-safe code does not necessarily have to be reentrant (see below for examples).

Other terms used for reentrant programs include "pure procedure" or "sharable code".{{sfn|Ralston|2000|p=1514–1515}}

Reentrancy of a subroutine that operates on operating-system resources or non-local data depends on the [[atomicity (programming)|atomicity]] of the respective operations. For example, if the subroutine modifies a 64-bit global variable on a 32-bit machine, the operation may be split into two 32-bit operations, and thus, if the subroutine is interrupted while executing, and called again from the interrupt handler, the global variable may be in a state where only 32 bits have been updated. The programming language might provide atomicity guarantees for interruption caused by an internal action such as a jump or call. Then the function {{code|f}} in an expression like &lt;code&gt;(global:=1) + (f())&lt;/code&gt;, where the order of evaluation of the subexpressions might be arbitrary in a programming language, would see the global variable either set to 1 or to its previous value, but not in an intermediate state where only part has been updated. (The latter can happen in [[C programming language|C]], because the expression has no [[sequence point]].) The operating system might provide atomicity guarantees for [[signal (computing)|signals]], such as a system call interrupted by a signal not having a partial effect. The processor hardware might provide atomicity guarantees for [[interrupt]]s, such as interrupted processor instructions not having partial effects.

==Examples==
To illustrate reentrancy, this article uses as an example a [[C (programming language)|C]] utility function, {{code|swap()}}, that takes two pointers and transposes their values, and an interrupt-handling routine that also calls the swap function.

===Neither reentrant nor thread-safe===
This is an example swap function that fails to be reentrant or thread-safe. As such, it should not have been used in the interrupt service routine &lt;code&gt;isr()&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int tmp;

void swap(int* x, int* y)
{
    tmp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = tmp;    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */
}

void isr()
{
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Thread-safe but not reentrant===
The function {{code|swap()}} in the preceding example can be made thread-safe by making {{code|tmp}} [[Thread-local storage|thread-local]]. It still fails to be reentrant, and this will continue to cause problems if {{code|isr()}} is called in the same context as a thread already executing {{code|swap()}}:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
_Thread_local int tmp;

void swap(int* x, int* y)
{
    tmp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = tmp;    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */
}

void isr()
{
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Reentrant but not thread-safe===
The following (somewhat contrived) modification of the swap function, which is careful to leave the global data in a consistent state at the time it exits, is reentrant; however, it is not thread-safe, since it does not ensure the global data is in a consistent state during execution:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int tmp;

void swap(int* x, int* y)
{
    /* Save global variable. */
    int s;
    s = tmp;

    tmp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = tmp;     /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */

    /* Restore global variable. */
    tmp = s;
}

void isr()
{
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===Reentrant and thread-safe===
An implementation of {{code|swap()}} that allocates {{code|tmp}} on the [[call stack|stack]] instead of on the [[heap (programming)|heap]] is both thread-safe and reentrant:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
void swap(int* x, int* y)
{
    int tmp;
    tmp = *x;
    *x = *y;
    *y = tmp;    /* Hardware interrupt might invoke isr() here. */
}

void isr()
{
    int x = 1, y = 2;
    swap(&amp;x, &amp;y);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==Background==
Reentrancy is not the same thing as [[idempotence]], in which the function may be called more than once yet generate exactly the same output as if it had only been called once. Generally speaking, a function produces output data based on some input data (though both are optional, in general). Shared data could be accessed by any function at any time. If data can be changed by any function (and none keep track of those changes), there is no guarantee to those that share a datum that that datum is the same as at any time before.

Data has a characteristic called [[Scope and extent|scope]], which describes where in a program the data may be used. Data scope is either [[global variable|global]] (outside the [[variable scope|scope]] of any function and with an indefinite extent) or [[Local variables, recursion and reentrancy|local]] (created each time a function is called and destroyed upon exit).

Local data is not shared by any routines, re-entering or not; therefore, it does not affect re-entrance. Global data is defined outside functions and can be accessed by more than one function, either in form of [[global variable]]s (data shared between all functions), or as [[static variable]]s (data shared by all functions of the same name). In [[object-oriented programming]], global data is defined in the scope of a class and can be private, making it accessible only to functions of that class. There is also the concept of [[instance variable]]s, where a class variable is bound to a class instance. For these reasons, in object-oriented programming, this distinction is usually reserved for the data accessible outside of the class (public), and for the data independent of class instances (static).

Reentrancy is distinct from, but closely related to, [[thread-safety]]. A function can be [[thread-safe]] and still not reentrant. For example, a function could be wrapped all around with a [[mutex]] (which avoids problems in multithreading environments), but, if that function were used in an interrupt service routine, it could starve waiting for the first execution to release the mutex. The key for avoiding confusion is that reentrant refers to only ''one'' thread executing. It is a concept from the time when no multitasking operating systems existed.

==Rules for reentrancy==
;Reentrant code may not hold any static or global non-constant data.
:Reentrant functions can work with global data. For example, a reentrant interrupt service routine could grab a piece of hardware status to work with (e.g., serial port read buffer) which is not only global, but volatile. Still, typical use of static variables and global data is not advised, in the sense that only [[atomic (computer science)|atomic]] [[read-modify-write]] instructions should be used in these variables (it should not be possible for an interrupt or signal to come during the execution of such an instruction). Note that in C, even a read or write is not guaranteed to be atomic; it may be split into several reads or writes.{{r|Preshing (2013)}} The C standard and SUSv3 provide &lt;code&gt;sig_atomic_t&lt;/code&gt; for this purpose, although with guarantees only for simple reads and writes, not for incrementing or decrementing.{{sfn|Kerrisk|2010|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=2SAQAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA428 428]}} More complex atomic operations are available in [[C11 (C standard revision)|C11]], which provides &lt;code&gt;stdatomic.h&lt;/code&gt;.
;Reentrant code may not [[self-modifying code|modify itself]].
:The operating system might allow a process to modify its code. There are various reasons for this (e.g., [[blitting]] graphics quickly) but this would cause a problem with reentrancy, since the code might not be the same next time.
:It may, however, modify itself if it resides in its own unique memory. That is, if each new invocation uses a different physical machine code location where a copy of the original code is made, it will not affect other invocations even if it modifies itself during execution of that particular invocation (thread).
;Reentrant code may not call non-reentrant [[computer program]]s or [[Subroutine|routines]].
:Multiple levels of user, object, or process [[Priority queue|priority]] or [[multiprocessing]] usually complicate the control of reentrant code. It is important to keep track of any access or side effects that are done inside a routine designed to be reentrant.

==Reentrant interrupt handler==
A reentrant interrupt handler is an [[interrupt handler]] that re-enables interrupts early in the interrupt handler. This may reduce [[interrupt latency]].{{sfn|Sloss|Symes|Wright|Rayfield|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=vdk4ZGRqMskC&amp;pg=PA342 342]}} In general, while programming interrupt service routines, it is recommended to re-enable interrupts as soon as possible in the interrupt handler. This practice helps to avoid losing interrupts.{{r|Regehr (2006)}}

==Further examples==
In the following code, neither &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; nor &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; functions are reentrant.

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int v = 1;

int f()
{
    v += 2;
    return v;
}

int g()
{
    return f() + 2;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above, {{code|f()}} depends on a non-constant global variable {{code|v}}; thus, if two threads execute it and access {{code|v}} concurrently, a [[race condition]] results. The value of {{code|v}} and, therefore, the return value of {{code|f}}, cannot be predicted with confidence: they will vary depending on the timing of the execution.{{clarify|date=May 2012|reason=This appears to be confusing reentrancy and thread-safety.}} Hence, {{code|f}} is not reentrant. Neither is {{code|g}}, because it calls {{code|f}}, which is not reentrant.

These slightly altered versions ''are'' reentrant:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int f(int i)
{
    return i + 2;
}

int g(int i)
{
    return f(i) + 2;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the following, the function is thread-safe, but not reentrant:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int function()
{
    mutex_lock();

    // ...
    // function body
    // ...

    mutex_unlock();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the above, {{code|function()}} can be called by different threads without any problem. But, if the function is used in a reentrant interrupt handler and a second interrupt arises inside the function, the second routine will hang forever. As interrupt servicing can disable other interrupts, the whole system could suffer.

'''Robert Leopold Spitzer'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysed.gov/coms/op001/opsc2a?profcd=60&amp;plicno=080978&amp;namechk=SPI Professional License Verification], New York State Education Department&lt;/ref&gt; (May 22, 1932 – December 25, 2015) was a psychiatrist and professor of [[psychiatry]] at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. He was a major force in the development of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM).

==Education and early years==
Spitzer was born in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1932.

He received his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[psychology]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1953 and his [[M.D.]] from [[New York University School of Medicine]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="Interview"&gt;{{cite book|last= Drescher|first= Jack|title=Ex-Gay Research: Analyzing the Spitzer Study and Its Relation to Science, Religion, Politics, and Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PkMBxnEQ1IMC|chapter=An Interview with Robert L.

Spitzer wrote an article on [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s theories in 1953 which the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' declined to publish.&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer, Robert L. [http://www.srmhp.org/0401/spitzer.html "The Story of Robert L. Spitzer's Paper, 'An Examination of Wilhelm Reich's Demonstration of Orgone Energy'"], ''The Scientific Review of Mental Health Practice'', Vol. 4, No. 1, Spring–Summer 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Spitzer spent most of his career at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]] as a Professor of Psychiatry until he retired in 2003.&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt; He was on the research faculty of the [[Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research]] where he retired after 49 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tribute to Robert L.

A colleague at Columbia has described him as an "iconoclast" who "looked for injustice".&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt;

=== Screening and Diagnostic Tools ===
Spitzer was a major architect of the modern [[classification of mental disorders]]. 
In 1968, he co-developed a computer program, ''Diagno I'', based on a logical [[decision tree]], that could derive a diagnosis from the scores on a Psychiatric Status Schedule which he co-published in 1970 and that the ''United States Steering Committee for the United States–United Kingdom Diagnostic Project'' used to check the consistency of its results.&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;{{cite book|author=Cooper, J. E.|title=Psychiatric Diagnosis in New York and London |year=1972 |publisher= Oxford University Press|location=London|isbn=0-19-712142-X|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|48}}

Spitzer was a member on the four-person ''United States Steering Committee for the United States–United Kingdom Diagnostic Project'', which published their results in 1972. They found the most important difference between countries was that the concept of [[schizophrenia]] used in New York was much broader than the one used in London, and included patients who would have been termed [[manic-depressive]] or [[bipolar disorder|bipolar]].&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;{{rp|vii}}

He developed psychiatric methods that focused on asking specific interview questions to get at a diagnosis as opposed to the [[open-ended question]]ing of psychoanalysis, which was the predominant technique of mental health.&lt;ref name=lancet/&gt; He codeveloped the [[Mood Disorders Questionnaire|Mood Disorder Questionnaire]] (MDQ), a screening technique used for diagnosing bipolar disorder. He also co-developed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PRIME-MD) which can be self-administered to find out if one has a mental illness.&lt;ref name=NYSPI /&gt;{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Spitzer RL, Kroenke K, Williams JB. Patient Health Questionnaire Primary Care Study Group. Validation and utility of a self-report version of the PRIME-MD: the PHQ primary care study. JAMA. 1999;282:1737–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The portions of PRIME-MD directed at depression (PHQ2 and PHQ9) have since become accepted in primary care medicine for screening and diagnosis of major depression as well as for monitoring response to treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Am Fam Physician. 2012;85(2):139-144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manea, Laura L (01/2015). "A diagnostic meta-analysis of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ([[PHQ-9]]) algorithm scoring method as a screen for depression.". General hospital psychiatry (0163-8343), 37 (1), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Position on the ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' ===
In 1974, Spitzer became the chair of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s task force of the third edition of the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' the so-called, ''[[DSM-III]]'' which was released in 1980. Spitzer is a major architect of the modern classification of mental disorders which involves classifying mental disorders in discrete categories with specified diagnostic criteria but later criticized what he saw as errors and excesses in the DSM's later versions, although he maintained his position that the ''DSM'' is still better than the alternatives.&lt;ref name=psychtimes/&gt;

In 2003, Spitzer co-authored a position paper with ''[[DSM-IV]]'' editor [[Michael First]], stating that the "''DSM'' is generally viewed as clinically useful" based on surveys from practicing professionals and feedback from medical students and residents, but that [[primary care]] physicians find the ''DSM'' too complicated for their use.  The authors emphasized that given then-current limitations in understanding psychiatric disorders, a multitude of ''DSM'' codes/diagnoses might apply to some patients, but that it would be a "total speculation" to assign a single diagnosis to a patient. The authors rejected calls to adopt the [[ICD-9]] because it lacked diagnostic criteria and would "[set] psychiatry back 30 years," while the [[ICD-10]], closely resembled the DSM-III-R classification.&lt;ref name=psychtimes&gt;{{cite web| last1= First | first1= Michael | first2= Robert L. | last2= Spitzer| url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/48541 | title= The ''DSM'': Not Perfect, but Better Than the Alternative| date= 1 April 2003 | work=[[Psychiatric Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a definitive autobiography of Spitzer, "The Making of DSM-III®: A Diagnostic Manual's Conquest of American Psychiatry", was published by author and historian Hannah S. Decker.

Spitzer was briefly featured in the 2007 [[BBC]] TV series ''[[The Trap (television documentary series)|The Trap]]'', in which he stated that the ''DSM'', by [[operational definition|operationalizing the definitions]] of mental disorders while paying little attention to the context in which the symptoms occur, may have [[Medicalization|medicalized]] the normal human experiences of a significant number of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Spitzer, Robert |title=The Trap|publisher=BBC via The Internet Archive|time=Part 2 at 34:10|date=March 2007|url=https://archive.org/details/AdamCurtis_TheTrap|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Spitzer had criticized the revision process of the ''[[DSM-5]]'' for lacking [[transparency (social)|transparency]].&lt;ref name=nyt081218&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/18/health/18psych.html?pagewanted=all|title=Psychiatrists Revise the Book of Human Troubles|first=Benedict|last=Carey|date=December 17, 2008|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also criticized specific proposals, like the proposed introduction of the [[psychosis risk syndrome]] for people who have mild symptoms found in psychotic disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Stein | first=Rob|title=Revision to the bible of psychiatry, ''DSM'', could introduce new mental disorders| work= The Washington Post|date=10 February 2010|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/10/AR2010021000009.html|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On homosexuality===

Spitzer led a successful effort, in 1973, to stop treating homosexuality as a mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/12/27/461175226/psychiatrist-who-played-major-role-in-destigmatizing-homosexuality-has-died Psychiatrist Who Played Major Role In Destigmatizing Homosexuality Dies : The Two-Way : NPR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/27/us/robert-spitzer-psychiatrist-who-set-rigorous-standards-for-diagnosis-dies-at-83.html Robert Spitzer, 83, Dies; Psychiatrist Set Rigorous Standards for Diagnosis - The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

It was partly due to Spitzer's efforts that homosexuality was "removed" (i.e. renamed as Sexual Orientation Disturbance) in 1974 [[DSM-II]]: "By withdrawing it from the manual, homosexuality was legitimized as a normal difference rather than a psychiatric behavior. This early powerful statement by institutional psychiatry that this is normal sped up the confidence of people in the movement."
&lt;ref name=lancet&gt;Alison Snyder. Robert L Spitzer. Obituary. The Lancet. Volume 387, Issue 10017, 30 January–5 February 2016, Page 428.
doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(16)00182-3.{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Spitzer delivered a controversial paper, "[[Can Some Gay Men and Lesbians Change Their Sexual Orientation?]]" at the 2001 annual APA meeting; he argued that it is possible that some highly motivated individuals could successfully [[sexual orientation change efforts|change their sexual orientation]] from homosexual to heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stolaf.edu/people/huff/classes/Psych130S2012/LabDocuments/Spitzer.pdf Can Some Gay Men and Lesbians Change Their Sexual Orientation? 200 Participants Reporting a Change from Homosexual to Heterosexual Orientation]&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Washington Post'' article indicated that Spitzer held 45 min telephonic interviews with 200 people who claimed that their respective sexual orientations had changed from homosexual to heterosexual. Spitzer said he "began his study as a skeptic," but the study revealed that "66 percent of the men and 44 percent of the women had arrived at what [Spitzer] called good heterosexual functioning," defined as "being in a sustained, loving heterosexual relationship within the past year, getting enough satisfaction from the emotional relationship with their partner to rate at least seven on a 10-point scale, having satisfying heterosexual sex at least monthly and never or rarely thinking of somebody of the same sex during heterosexual sex."

Spitzer also found that "89 percent of men and 95 percent of women said they were bothered only slightly, or not at all, by unwanted homosexual feelings" but that "only 11 percent of the men and 37 percent of the women reported a complete absence of homosexual indicators, including same-sex attraction.... Some 43 percent of the sample had been referred to Spitzer by 'ex-gay ministries.... An additional 23 percent were referred by the National Association for Research and Therapy of Homosexuality." Spitzer has stated that his research "shows some people can change from gay to straight, and we ought to acknowledge that."&lt;ref name="Some Gays Can"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010509/aponline013921_000.htm | title=Study: Some Gays Can Go Straight | first= Malcolm | last = Ritter | work=The Washington Post | date=9 May 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering how difficult it had been to find 100 participants, and that they were considered the best cases of [[conversion therapy]], Spitzer concluded that although change could occur, it was probably very rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ZwE6_dLweYo|Interview with Dr Spitzer}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.truthwinsout.org/in-dr-robert-spitzers-own-words/ In Dr. Robert Spitzer's Own Words], TruthWinsOut.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The APA issued an official disavowal of Spitzer's paper, noting that it had not been peer reviewed and stating, "There is no published scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of [[reparative therapy]] as a treatment to change one's sexual orientation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gayhealth.com/templates/1153405334669988619162/common/feature.html?record=552&amp;trycookie=1?record=552 Article]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928091622/http://www.gayhealth.com/templates/1153405334669988619162/common/feature.html?record=552&amp;trycookie=1%3Frecord%3D552 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, was published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior.

Two thirds of the reviews were critical, and the publication decision sparked controversy, with one member of the publication's supporting organization resigning in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=180133 |title=Storm over gay 'cure' |date=October 3, 2003 |first=Steve |last=Farrar |work=[[Times Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper has been criticized for its sampling methods and criteria for success.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_spit.htm Analysis of Dr. Spitzer's study of reparative therapy], ReligiousTolerance.org&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 interview, Spitzer stated, "Many colleagues were outraged" following the publication of the study. Spitzer added, "Within the gay community, there was initially tremendous anger and feeling that I had betrayed them." When asked whether he would consider a follow-up study, Spitzer said no and added that he felt "a little battle fatigue."&lt;ref name=TherIncor&gt;Leblanc, Douglas. Interview of Robert Spitzer. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/april/20.94.html "Therapeutically Incorrect: Atheist psychiatrist argues that gays can change"], ''Christianity Today'', 29 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; While Spitzer has said that he has no way of knowing whether the study participants were being honest,&lt;ref name="Some Gays Can" /&gt; he has also indicated that he believed that the interviewees were being candid with him.&lt;ref name=TherIncor /&gt;

In a 2012 interview, Spitzer said he asked to retract the study and stated that he agreed with its critics:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

: "In retrospect, I have to admit I think the critiques are largely correct," he said. "The findings can be considered evidence for what those who have undergone ex-gay therapy say about it, but nothing more." He said he spoke with the editor of the Archives of Sexual Behavior about writing a retraction, but the editor declined. (Repeated attempts to contact the journal went unanswered.)

In a letter to [[Kenneth J Zucker]], editor of ''Journal of Sexual Behavior'', Spitzer wrote:
{{quote|"Several months ago I told you that because of my revised view of my 2001 study of reparative therapy changing sexual orientation, I was considering writing something that would acknowledge that I now judged the major critiques of the study as largely correct. After discussing my revised view of the study with Gabriel Arana, a reporter for ''American Prospect', and with Malcolm Ritter, an [[Associated Press]] science writer, I decided that I had to make public my current thinking about the study. Here it is.
&lt;br&gt;"'''Basic Research Question.''' From the beginning it was: “can some version of reparative therapy enable individuals to change their sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual?” Realizing that the study design made it impossible to answer this question, I suggested that the study could be viewed as answering the question, “how do individuals undergoing reparative therapy describe changes in sexual orientation?” – a not very interesting question.
&lt;br&gt;"'''The Fatal Flaw in the Study – There was no way to judge the credibility of subject reports of change in sexual orientation.''' I offered several (unconvincing) reasons why it was reasonable to assume that the subject’s reports of change were credible and not self-deception or outright lying. But the simple fact is that there was no way to determine if the subject’s accounts of change were valid.&lt;br&gt;I believe I owe the gay community an apology for my study making unproven claims of the efficacy of reparative therapy. I also apologize to any gay person who wasted time and energy undergoing some form of reparative therapy because they believed that I had proven that reparative therapy works with some “highly motivated” individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In [[fluid dynamics]], a '''stall''' is a reduction in the [[lift (force)|lift]] coefficient generated by a [[foil (fluid mechanics)|foil]] as [[angle of attack]] increases.&lt;ref name="Crane"&gt;Crane, Dale: ''Dictionary of Aeronautical Terms, third edition'', p. 486. Aviation Supplies &amp; Academics, 1997. {{ISBN|1-56027-287-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This occurs when the [[critical angle of attack]] of the foil is exceeded.  The critical angle of attack is typically about 15 degrees, but it may vary significantly depending on the fluid, foil, and [[Reynolds number]].

Stalls in fixed-wing flight are often experienced as a sudden reduction in lift as the pilot increases the wing's angle of attack and exceeds its critical angle of attack (which may be due to slowing down below [[#Speed|stall speed]] in level flight). A stall does not mean that the engine(s) have stopped working, or that the aircraft has stopped moving—the effect is the same even in an unpowered [[glider aircraft]]. [[Thrust vectoring|Vectored thrust]] in manned and unmanned aircraft is used to surpass the stall limit, thereby giving rise to [[post-stall]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Gal-Or, ''Vectored Propulsion, Supermaneuverability, and Robot Aircraft'', Springer Verlag, 1990, {{ISBN|0-387-97161-0}}, {{ISBN|3-540-97161-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USAF &amp; NATO Report RTO-TR-015 AC/323/(HFM-015)/TP-1 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Because stalls are most commonly discussed in connection with [[aviation]], this article discusses stalls as they relate mainly to aircraft, in particular [[fixed-wing aircraft]]. The principles of stall discussed here translate to foils in other fluids as well.

==Formal definition==
[[File:StallFormation.svg|right|350px]]
A stall is a condition in [[aerodynamics]] and aviation wherein the angle of attack increases beyond a certain point such that lift begins to decrease. The angle at which this occurs is called the ''critical angle of attack''. This critical angle is dependent upon the airfoil section or profile of the wing, its [[planform (aeronautics)|planform]], its [[aspect ratio (aeronautics)|aspect ratio]], and other factors, but is typically in the range of 8 to 20 degrees relative to the incoming wind ("relative wind") for most subsonic airfoils. The critical angle of attack is the angle of attack on the [[lift coefficient]] versus angle-of-attack curve at which the maximum lift coefficient occurs.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flow separation]] begins to occur at small angles of attack while attached flow over the wing is still dominant. As angle of attack increases, the separated regions on the top of the wing increase in size and hinder the wing's ability to create lift. At the critical angle of attack, separated flow is so dominant that additional increases in angle of attack produce ''less'' lift and more [[drag (physics)|drag]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

A fixed-wing aircraft during a stall may experience [[buffeting]] or a change in [[Aircraft attitude|attitude]]. Most aircraft are designed to have a gradual stall with characteristics that will warn the pilot and give them time to react. For example, an aircraft that does not buffet before the stall may have an audible alarm or a [[stick shaker]] installed to simulate the feel of a buffet by vibrating the stick fore and aft. The critical angle of attack in steady straight and level flight can be attained only at low airspeed. Attempts to increase the angle of attack at higher airspeeds can cause a high-speed stall or may merely cause the aircraft to climb.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Any [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] of the aircraft as it enters the stall regime can result in [[autorotation (fixed-wing aircraft)|autorotation]], which is also sometimes referred to as a "[[spin (aerodynamics)|spin]]". As air no longer flows smoothly over the wings during a stall, [[aileron]] control of roll becomes less effective, whilst simultaneously the tendency for the ailerons to generate [[adverse yaw]] increases. This characteristic increases the lift from the advancing wing and increases the likelihood of the aircraft entering into a spin.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

==Graph==

[[File:Lift curve.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|An example of the relationship between angle of attack and lift on a cambered airfoil. The exact relationship is usually measured in a [[wind tunnel]] and depends on the airfoil section. The relationship for an aircraft wing depends on the planform and its aspect ratio.]]

The graph shows that the greatest amount of lift is produced as the critical angle of attack is reached (which in early-20th century aviation was called the "burble point"). This angle is 17.5 degrees in this case, but it varies from airfoil to airfoil. In particular, for aerodynamically thick airfoils (thickness to [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] ratios of around 10%), the critical angle is higher than with a thin airfoil of the same [[camber (aerodynamics)|camber]]. Symmetric airfoils have lower critical angles (but also work efficiently in inverted flight). The graph shows that, as the angle of attack exceeds the critical angle, the lift produced by the airfoil decreases.

The information in a graph of this kind is gathered using a model of the airfoil in a [[wind tunnel]]. Because aircraft models are normally used, rather than full-size machines, special care is needed to make sure that data is taken in the same [[Reynolds number]] regime (or scale speed) as in free flight. The separation of flow from the upper wing surface at high angles of attack is quite different at low Reynolds number from that at the high Reynolds numbers of real aircraft. High-pressure wind tunnels are one solution to this problem. In general, steady operation of an aircraft at an angle of attack above the critical angle is not possible because, after exceeding the critical angle, the loss of lift from the wing causes the nose of the aircraft to fall, reducing the angle of attack again. This nose drop, independent of control inputs, indicates the pilot has actually stalled the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Sections 5.28 and 16.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, J.D., ''A History of Aerodynamics'', pp. 296–311&lt;/ref&gt;

This graph shows the stall angle, yet in practice most pilot operating handbooks (POH) or generic flight manuals describe stalling in terms of [[airspeed]]. This is because all aircraft are equipped with an [[airspeed indicator]], but fewer aircraft have an angle of attack indicator. An aircraft's stalling speed is published by the manufacturer (and is required for certification by flight testing) for a range of weights and flap positions, but the stalling angle of attack is not published.

As speed reduces, angle of attack has to increase to keep lift constant until the critical angle is reached. The airspeed at which this angle is reached is the (1g, unaccelerated) stalling speed of the aircraft in that particular configuration. Deploying [[flap (aircraft)|flaps]]/slats decreases the stall speed to allow the aircraft to take off and land at a lower speed.

==Aerodynamic description==

===Fixed-wing aircraft===
A [[fixed-wing aircraft]] can be made to stall in any [[Flight dynamics (fixed-wing aircraft)|pitch]] attitude or bank angle or at any airspeed but deliberate stalling is commonly practiced by reducing the speed to the unaccelerated stall speed, at a safe altitude. Unaccelerated (1g) stall speed varies on different fixed-wing aircraft and is represented by colour codes on the [[airspeed indicator]]. As the plane flies at this speed, the angle of attack must be increased to prevent any loss of altitude or gain in airspeed (which corresponds to the stall angle described above). The pilot will notice the [[aircraft flight control system|flight controls]] have become less responsive and may also notice some buffeting, a result of the turbulent air separated from the wing hitting the tail of the aircraft.

In most [[light aircraft]], as the stall is reached, the aircraft will start to descend (because the wing is no longer producing enough lift to support the aircraft's weight) and the nose will pitch down. Recovery from the stall involves lowering the aircraft nose, to decrease the angle of attack and increase the air speed, until smooth air-flow over the wing is restored. Normal flight can be resumed once recovery is complete.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The maneuver is normally quite safe, and, if correctly handled, leads to only a small loss in altitude (20–30&amp;nbsp;m/50–100&amp;nbsp;ft). It is taught and practised in order for pilots to recognize, avoid, and recover from stalling the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;14 CFR part 61&lt;/ref&gt; A pilot is required to demonstrate competency in controlling an aircraft during and after a stall for certification in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Regulations Part25 section 201&lt;/ref&gt; and it is a routine maneuver for pilots when getting to know the handling of an unfamiliar aircraft type. The only dangerous aspect of a stall is a lack of altitude for recovery.

A special form of asymmetric stall in which the aircraft also rotates about its yaw axis is called a [[Spin (aerodynamics)|spin]]. A spin can occur if an aircraft is stalled and there is an asymmetric yawing moment applied to it.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, pp. 12–16&lt;/ref&gt; This yawing moment can be aerodynamic (sideslip angle, rudder, adverse yaw from the ailerons), thrust related (p-factor, one engine inoperative on a multi-engine non-centreline thrust aircraft), or from less likely sources such as severe turbulence. The net effect is that one wing is stalled before the other and the aircraft descends rapidly while rotating, and some aircraft cannot recover from this condition without correct pilot control inputs (which must stop yaw) and loading.&lt;ref&gt;14 CFR part 23&lt;/ref&gt; A new solution to the problem of difficult (or impossible) stall-spin recovery is provided by the [[ballistic parachute]] recovery system.

The most common stall-spin scenarios occur on takeoff ([[departure resistance|departure]] stall) and during landing (base to final turn) because of insufficient airspeed during these maneuvers. Stalls also occur during a go-around manoeuvre if the pilot does not properly respond to the out-of-trim situation resulting from the transition from low power setting to high power setting at low speed.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, pp. 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Stall speed is increased when the wing surfaces are [[Atmospheric icing|contaminated with ice]] or frost creating a rougher surface, and heavier airframe due to ice accumulation.

Stalls occur not only at slow airspeed, but at any speed when the wings exceed their critical angle of attack. Attempting to increase the angle of attack at 1g by moving the control column back normally causes the aircraft to climb. However, aircraft often experience higher g-forces, such as when turning steeply or pulling out of a dive. In these cases, the wings are already operating at a higher angle of attack to create the necessary force (derived from lift) to accelerate in the desired direction. Increasing the g-loading still further, by pulling back on the controls, can cause the stalling angle to be exceeded, even though the aircraft is flying at a high speed.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Airplane flying handbook {{ISBN|978-1-60239-003-4}} Chapter 4, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; These "high-speed stalls" produce the same buffeting characteristics as 1g stalls and can also initiate a spin if there is also any yawing.

===Symptoms of onset===
One symptom of an approaching stall is slow and sloppy controls. As the speed of the aircraft decreases approaching the stall, there is less air moving over the wing, and, therefore, less air will be deflected by the control surfaces (ailerons, elevator, and rudder) at this lower speed. Some buffeting may also be felt from the turbulent flow above the wings as the stall is reached. The stall warning will sound, if fitted, in most aircraft 5 to 10 knots above the stall speed.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Aviation Regulations part 25 section 207&lt;/ref&gt;

===Characteristics===
Different aircraft types have different stalling characteristics. A benign stall is one where the nose drops gently and the wings remain level throughout. Slightly more demanding is a stall in which one wing stalls slightly before the other, causing that wing to drop sharply, with the possibility of entering a spin. A dangerous stall is one in which the nose rises, pushing the wing deeper into the stalled state and potentially leading to an unrecoverable ''[[#Deep stall|deep stall]]''. This can occur in some T-tailed aircraft wherein the turbulent airflow from the stalled wing can blanket the control surfaces at the tail.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Stalls depend only on angle of attack, not [[airspeed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stick and Rudder|author=Langewiesche, Wolfgang|publisher=McGraw Hill|date=1972|pages=18–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the more slowly an airplane goes, the greater the angle of attack it needs to produce lift equal to the aircraft's weight.&lt;ref name="phakcp4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/airplane_handbook/media/faa-h-8083-3a-3of7.pdf|title=Pilot's Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge – Chapter 4|accessdate=2014-03-13|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904015736/http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/airplane_handbook/media/faa-h-8083-3a-3of7.pdf|archive-date=2013-09-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the speed decreases further, at some point this angle will be equal to the [[Critical angle of attack|critical (stall) angle of attack]]. This speed is called the "stall speed". An aircraft flying at its stall speed cannot climb, and an aircraft flying below its stall speed cannot stop descending. Any attempt to do so by increasing angle of attack, without first increasing airspeed, will result in a stall.

The actual stall speed will vary depending on the airplane's weight, altitude, configuration, and vertical and lateral acceleration. Guidelines for the case of zero acceleration are provided by the following [[V speeds]]:
* V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;: The computed stalling speed with [[flap (aircraft)|flaps]] retracted at design speed. Often has the same value as V&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt;.
* V&lt;sub&gt;S0&lt;/sub&gt;: The stall speed in landing configuration (full flaps, [[landing gear]] down, [[spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]] retracted).
* V&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt;: The stall speed in a "clean" configuration (flaps, landing gear and spoilers all retracted as far as possible).
* V&lt;sub&gt;SR&lt;/sub&gt;: Reference stall speed.&lt;ref name="faacfr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;SID=f553dbb9c06409a040f3d6865e435c70&amp;rgn=div8&amp;view=text&amp;node=14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.2&amp;idno=14;cc=ecfr|title=Electronic Code of Federal Regulations – Chapter 14.1|accessdate=2008-05-07|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On an airspeed indicator, the bottom of the white arc indicates V&lt;sub&gt;S0&lt;/sub&gt; at maximum weight, while the bottom of the green arc indicates V&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt; at maximum weight. While an aircraft's V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; speed is computed by design, its V&lt;sub&gt;S0&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;S1&lt;/sub&gt; speeds must be demonstrated empirically by flight testing.&lt;ref&gt;Flight testing of fixed wing aircraft.

==In accelerated and turning flight==
[[File:Accelerated stall.gif|thumb|350px|Illustration of a turning flight stall, occurring during a co-ordinated turn with progressively increasing angle of bank.]]
The normal stall speed, specified by the V&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; values above, always refers to straight and level flight, where the [[load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]] is equal to 1g. However, if the aircraft is turning or pulling up from a dive, additional lift is required to provide the vertical or lateral acceleration, and so the stall speed is higher. An accelerated stall is a stall that occurs under such conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Considering, for example, a [[banked turn#Aviation|banked turn]], the [[lift (force)|lift]] required is equal to the [[weight]] of the aircraft plus extra lift to provide the [[centripetal force]] necessary to perform the turn; that is:&lt;ref name=Clancy5.22/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Barnes W. (1979), ''Aerodynamics, Aeronautics and Flight Mechanics'', p. 464, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York {{ISBN|0-471-03032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;L = nW&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:&lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; = lift
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = load factor (greater than 1 in a turn)
:&lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; = weight of the aircraft

To achieve the extra lift, the [[lift coefficient]], and so the angle of attack, will have to be higher than it would be in straight and level flight at the same speed. Therefore, given that the stall always occurs at the same critical angle of attack,&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Sections 5.8 and 5.22&lt;/ref&gt; by increasing the load factor (e.g., by tightening the turn) such critical angle – and the stall – will be reached with the airspeed remaining well above the normal stall speed,&lt;ref name="Clancy5.22"&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.22&lt;/ref&gt; that is:&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', Equation 14.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Barnes W.

The table that follows gives some examples of the relation between the [[angle of bank]] and the square root of the load factor. It derives from the trigonometric relation ([[Cosecant|secant]]) between &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, in a turn with bank angle of 45°, V&lt;sub&gt;st&lt;/sub&gt; is 19% higher than V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;.

It should be noted that, according to [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) terminology, the above example illustrates a so-called '''turning flight stall''', while the term ''accelerated'' is used to indicate an ''accelerated turning stall'' only, that is, a turning flight stall where the airspeed decreases at a given rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A notable example of air accident involving a low-altitude turning flight stall is the [[1994 Fairchild Air Force Base B-52 crash]].

==Types==

===Dynamic stall===
Dynamic stall is a non-linear unsteady aerodynamic effect that occurs when airfoils rapidly change the angle of attack. The rapid change can cause a strong [[vortex]] to be shed from the leading edge of the aerofoil, and travel backwards above the wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buchner |first1=A. J. |last2=Soria |first2=J. |title=Measurements of the flow due to a rapidly pitching plate using time resolved high resolution PIV |journal=Aerospace Science and Technology |volume=44 |pages=4 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1270963814000789 |publisher=Aerospace Science and Technology |accessdate=18 October 2015 |year=2015 |doi=10.1016/j.ast.2014.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vortex, containing high-velocity airflows, briefly increases the lift produced by the wing. As soon as it passes behind the trailing edge, however, the lift reduces dramatically, and the wing is in normal stall.&lt;ref name="Filippone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aerodyn.org/Dstall/dstall.html |title=Dynamic Stall, Unsteady Aerodynamics |accessdate=March 25, 2016 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229110350/http://aerodyn.org/Dstall/dstall.html |archivedate=December 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic stall is an effect most associated with helicopters and flapping wings, though also occurs in wind turbines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/jfm.2018.112 |title=Dynamic stall in vertical axis wind turbines: Scaling and topological considerations |journal=Journal of Fluid Mechanics |volume=841 |pages=746-66 |year=2018 |last1=Buchner |first1=A-J. |last2=Soria |first2=J. |last3=Honnery |first3=D. |last4=Smits |first4=A.J. |bibcode=2018JFM...841..746B }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and due to gusting airflow. During forward flight, some regions of a helicopter blade may incur flow that reverses (compared to the direction of blade movement), and thus includes rapidly changing angles of attack. Oscillating (flapping) wings, such as those of insects—including the most famous one, the [[bumblebee]]—may rely almost entirely on dynamic stall for lift production, provided the oscillations are fast compared to the speed of flight, and the angle of the wing changes rapidly compared to airflow direction.&lt;ref name="Filippone" /&gt;

Stall delay can occur on [[airfoils]] subject to a high angle of attack and a three-dimensional flow. When the angle of attack on an airfoil is increasing rapidly, the flow will remain substantially attached to the airfoil to a significantly higher angle of attack than can be achieved in steady-state conditions. As a result, the stall is delayed momentarily and a lift coefficient significantly higher than the steady-state maximum is achieved. The effect was first noticed on [[Propeller (aircraft)|propellers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Trubshaw&lt;ref&gt;"Low Speed Handling with Special Reference to the Super Stall" Trubshaw, Appendix III in "Trubshaw Test Pilot" Trubshaw and Edmondson, Sutton Publishing 1998, {{ISBN|0 7509 1838 1}}, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; gives a broad definition of deep stall as penetrating to such angles of attack &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; that pitch control effectiveness is reduced by the wing and nacelle wakes. He also gives a definition that relates deep stall to a locked-in condition where recovery is impossible. This is a single value of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, for a given aircraft configuration, where there is no pitching moment, i.e. a trim point.

Typical values both for the range of deep stall, as defined above, and the locked-in trim point are given for the [[Douglas DC-9]] Series 10 by Schaufele.&lt;ref&gt;"Applied Aerodynamics at the Douglas Aircraft Company-A Historical Perspective" Roger D. Schaufele, 37th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit, January 11–14, 1999/Reno, NVFig.26 Deep Stall Pitching Moments&lt;/ref&gt; These values are from wind tunnel tests for an early design. The final design had no locked in trim point so recovery from the deep stall region was possible, as required to meet certification rules. Normal stall beginning at the 'g' break (sudden decrease of the vertical [[load factor (aeronautics)|load factor]]&lt;ref name=boeing/&gt;) was at 18 degrees &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, deep stall started at about 30 degrees and the locked-in unrecoverable trim point was at 47 degrees.

The very high &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; for a deep stall locked-in condition occurs well beyond the normal stall but can be attained very rapidly as the aircraft is unstable beyond the normal stall and requires immediate action to arrest it. The loss of lift causes high sink rates which, together with the low forward speed at the normal stall, give a high &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; with little or no rotation of the aircraft.&lt;ref name=trubshaw&gt;"Accident Report No. EW/C/039, Appendix IV in "Trubshaw Test Pilot" Trubshaw and Edmondson, Sutton Publishing 1998, {{ISBN|0 7509 1838 1}}, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; [[BAC 1-11]] G-ASHG, during stall flight tests before the type was modified to prevent a locked-in deep stall condition, descended at over {{convert|10000|ft/min|m/s|-1}} and struck the ground in a flat attitude moving only {{convert|70|ft|m|-1}} forward after initial impact.&lt;ref name=trubshaw/&gt; Sketches which show how the wing wake blankets the tail may be misleading if they imply that deep stall requires a high body angle.

Effects similar to deep stall had been known to occur on some aircraft designs before the term was coined. A prototype [[Gloster Javelin]] ([[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial]] ''WD808'') was lost in a crash on 11 June 1953, to a "locked in" stall&lt;ref&gt;[http://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=20519 ASN Wikibase Occurrence # 20519] Retrieved 4 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Waterton&lt;ref name=waterton&gt;"The Quick and the Dead" W.A.Waterton, Frederick Mueller, London 1956, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; states that the trimming tailplane was found to be the wrong way for recovery. Low speed handling tests were being done to assess a new wing.&lt;ref name=waterton/&gt; [[Handley Page Victor]] ''XL159'' was lost to a "stable stall" on 23 March 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thevictorassociation.org.uk/?p=491 A Tale of Two Victors] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322161536/http://www.thevictorassociation.org.uk/?p=491 |date=2012-03-22 }} Retrieved 4 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It had been clearing the fixed droop leading edge with the test being stall approach, landing configuration, C of G aft.

Brooks, Pen &amp; Sword Aviation 2007, {{ISBN|978 1 84415 570 5}}, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "deep stall" first came into widespread use after [[1963 BAC One-Eleven test crash|the crash]] of the prototype [[BAC 1-11]] G-ASHG on 22 October 1963, which killed its crew.&lt;ref&gt;""Report on the Accident to B.A.C. One-Eleven G-ASHG at Cratt Hill, near Chicklade, Wiltshire on 22nd October 1963'', Ministry of Aviation C.A.P. 219, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; This led to changes to the aircraft, including the installation of a [[stick shaker]] (see below) to clearly warn the pilot of an impending stall. Stick shakers are now a standard part of commercial airliners. Nevertheless, the problem continues to cause accidents; on 3 June 1966, a [[Hawker Siddeley Trident]] (G-ARPY), was [[1966 Felthorpe Trident crash|lost to deep stall]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19660603-1 |title=ASN Aircraft accident Hawker Siddeley HS-121 Trident 1C G-ARPY Felthorpe |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date=1966-06-03 |accessdate=2013-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; deep stall is suspected to be cause of another Trident (the [[British European Airways Flight 548]] ''G-ARPI'') crash – known as the "Staines Disaster" – on 18 June 1972 when the crew failed to notice the conditions and had disabled the stall recovery system.&lt;ref&gt;AIB Report 4/73, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 April 1980, a prototype of the [[Canadair Challenger]] [[business jet]] crashed after initially entering a deep stall from 17,000&amp;nbsp;ft and having both engines flame-out.

===Tip stall===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
Aircraft with a [[swept wing]] suffer from a particular form of stalling behaviour at low speed. At high speed the airflow over the wing tends to progress directly along the chord, but as the speed is reduced a sideways component due to the angle of the [[leading edge]] has time to build up. Airflow at the root is affected only by the angle of the wing, but at a point further along the span, the airflow is affected both by the angle as well as any sideways component of the airflow from the air closer to the root. This results in a pattern of airflow that is progressively "sideways" as one moves toward the wingtip.

As it is only the airflow along the chord that contributes to lift, this means that the wing begins to develop less lift at the tip than the root. In extreme cases, this can lead to the wingtip entering stall long before the wing as a whole. In this case the average lift of the wing as a whole moves forward; the inboard sections are continuing to generate lift and are generally in front of the [[center of gravity]] (C of G), while the tips are no longer contributing and are behind the C of G. This produces a strong nose-up pitch in the aircraft, which can lead to more of the wing stalling, the lift moving further forward, and so forth. This chain reaction is considered very dangerous and was known as the [[pitch-up]].

Tip stall can be prevented in a number of ways, at least one of which is found on almost all modern aircraft. An early solution was the addition of [[wing fence]]s to re-direct sideways moving air back towards the rear of the wing. A similar solution is the dog-tooth notch seen on some aircraft, like the [[Avro Arrow]]. A more common modern solution is to use some degree of [[Washout (aviation)|washout]].

==Warning and safety devices==
Fixed-wing aircraft can be equipped with devices to prevent or postpone a stall or to make it less (or in some cases more) severe, or to make recovery easier.
* An '''aerodynamic twist''' can be introduced to the wing with the leading edge near the wing tip twisted downward. This is called '''washout''' and causes the [[wing root]] to stall before the wing tip. This makes the stall gentle and progressive. Since the stall is delayed at the wing tips, where the [[aileron]]s are, roll control is maintained when the stall begins.
* A '''[[stall strip]]''' is a small sharp-edged device that, when attached to the leading edge of a wing, encourages the stall to start there in preference to any other location on the wing. If attached close to the wing root, it makes the stall gentle and progressive; if attached near the wing tip, it encourages the aircraft to drop a wing when stalling.
* A '''[[Wing fence|stall fence]]''' is a flat plate in the direction of the [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] to stop separated flow progressing out along the wing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/Transonic_Wings/TH20G6.htm |title=Stall fences and vortex generators |access-date=2009-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508032211/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Theories_of_Flight/Transonic_Wings/TH20G6.htm |archive-date=2009-05-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Vortex generator]]s''', tiny strips of metal or plastic placed on top of the wing near the leading edge that protrude past the [[boundary layer]] into the free stream. As the name implies, they energize the boundary layer by mixing free stream airflow with boundary layer flow thereby creating vortices, this increases the [[momentum]] in the boundary layer. By increasing the momentum of the boundary layer, airflow separation and the resulting stall may be delayed.
* An '''anti-stall strake''' is a [[leading edge extension]] that generates a [[vortex]] on the wing upper surface to postpone the stall.
* A '''[[stick pusher]]''' is a mechanical device that prevents the pilot from stalling an aircraft. It pushes the elevator control forward as the stall is approached, causing a reduction in the angle of attack. In generic terms, a stick pusher is known as a ''stall identification device'' or ''stall identification system''.&lt;ref&gt;US [[Federal Aviation Administration]], Advisory Circular 25-7A ''Flight Test Guide for Certification of Transport Category Airplanes'', paragraph 228&lt;/ref&gt;
* A '''[[stick shaker]]''' is a mechanical device that shakes the pilot's controls to warn of the onset of stall.
* A '''stall warning''' is an electronic or mechanical device that sounds an [[buzzer|audible warning]] as the stall speed is approached. The majority of aircraft contain some form of this device that warns the pilot of an impending stall. The simplest such device is a ''stall warning horn'', which consists of either a [[pressure]] [[sensor]] or a movable metal tab that actuates a [[switch]], and produces an audible warning in response.
* An '''angle-of-attack indicator''' for light aircraft, the "AlphaSystemsAOA" and a nearly identical "'''Lift Reserve Indicator'''", are both pressure differential instruments that display margin above stall and/or angle of attack on an instantaneous, continuous readout. The General Technics CYA-100 displays true angle of attack via a magnetically coupled vane. An AOA indicator provides a visual display of the amount of available lift throughout its slow speed envelope regardless of the many variables that act upon an aircraft. This indicator is immediately responsive to changes in speed, angle of attack, and wind conditions, and automatically compensates for aircraft weight, altitude, and temperature.
* An '''angle of attack limiter''' or an "alpha" limiter is a flight computer that automatically prevents pilot input from causing the plane to rise over the stall angle. Some alpha limiters can be disabled by the pilot.

Stall warning systems often involve inputs from a broad range of sensors and systems to include a dedicated angle of attack sensor.

Blockage, damage, or inoperation of stall and angle of attack (AOA) probes can lead to unreliability of the stall warning, and cause the stick pusher, overspeed warning, autopilot, and yaw damper to malfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/harco-probes-still-causing-eclipse-airspeed-problems/ |title=Harco Probes Still Causing Eclipse Airspeed Problems |access-date=2008-10-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926190738/http://www.ainonline.com/news/single-news-page/article/harco-probes-still-causing-eclipse-airspeed-problems/ |archive-date=2008-09-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a forward [[canard (aeronautics)|canard]] is used for pitch control, rather than an aft tail, the canard is designed to meet the airflow at a slightly greater angle of attack than the wing. Therefore, when the aircraft pitch increases abnormally, the canard will usually stall first, causing the nose to drop and so preventing the wing from reaching its critical AOA. Thus, the risk of main wing stalling is greatly reduced. However, if the main wing stalls, recovery becomes difficult, as the canard is more deeply stalled and angle of attack increases rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Airplane stability and control By Malcolm J. Abzug, E. Eugene Larrabee Chapter 17 {{ISBN|0-521-80992-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If an aft tail is used, the wing is designed to stall before the tail. In this case, the wing can be flown at higher lift coefficient (closer to stall) to produce more overall lift.

Most military combat aircraft have an angle of attack indicator among the pilot's instruments, which lets the pilot know precisely how close to the stall point the aircraft is. Modern airliner instrumentation may also measure angle of attack, although this information may not be directly displayed on the pilot's display, instead driving a stall warning indicator or giving performance information to the flight computer (for fly by wire systems).

==Flight beyond the stall==
As a wing stalls, [[aileron]] effectiveness is reduced, making the plane hard to control and increasing the risk of a spin starting. [[Post stall]], steady flight beyond the stalling angle (where the coefficient of lift is largest) requires engine thrust to replace lift as well as alternative controls to replace the loss of effectiveness of the ailerons. For high-powered aircraft, the loss of lift (and increase in drag) beyond the stall angle is less of a problem than maintaining control. Some aircraft may be subject to [[post-stall gyration]] (e.g. the [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]]) or susceptible to entering a [[Spin (aerodynamics)#Unrecoverable spins|flat-spin]] (e.g. [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]]). Control beyond-stall can be provided by reaction control systems (e.g. [[Lockheed NF-104A|NF-104A]]), vectored thrust, as well as a rolling [[stabilator]] (or taileron). The enhanced manoeuvering capability by flights at very high angles of attack can provide a tactical advantage for military fighters such as the [[F-22 Raptor]]. Short term stalls at 90–120° (e.g. [[Pugachev's Cobra]]) are sometimes performed at airshows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aviationfans.com/node/12 Pugachev's Cobra Maneuver]&lt;/ref&gt; The highest angle of attack in sustained flight so far demonstrated was 70 degrees in the [[X-31]] at the [[Dryden Flight Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfrc.nasa.gov/gallery/Photo/X-31/HTML/EC94-42478-3.html X-31 EC94-42478-3: X-31 at High Angle of Attack]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustained post-stall flight is a type of [[supermaneuverability]].

==Spoilers==
{{Main|Spoiler (aeronautics)}}
Except for flight training, airplane testing, and [[aerobatics]], a stall is usually an undesirable event. [[spoiler (aeronautics)|Spoilers]] (sometimes called lift dumpers), however, are devices that are intentionally deployed to create a carefully controlled [[flow separation]] over part of an aircraft's wing to reduce the lift it generates, increase the drag, and allow the aircraft to descend more rapidly without gaining speed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spoilers|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/spoil.html|publisher=[[NASA]], [[Glenn Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spoilers are also deployed asymmetrically (one wing only) to enhance roll control. Spoilers can also be used on aborted take-offs and after main wheel contact on landing to increase the aircraft's weight on its wheels for better braking action.

Unlike powered airplanes, which can control descent by increasing or decreasing thrust, gliders have to increase drag to increase the rate of descent. In high-performance gliders, spoiler deployment is extensively used to control the approach to landing.

Spoilers can also be thought of as  "lift reducers" because they reduce the lift of the wing in which the spoiler resides. For example, an uncommanded roll to the left could be reversed by raising the right wing spoiler (or only a few of the spoilers present in large airliner wings). This has the advantage of avoiding the need to increase lift in the wing that is dropping (which may bring that wing closer to stalling).

==History==
[[Otto Lilienthal]] died while flying in 1896 as the result of a stall. Wilbur Wright encountered stalls for the first time in 1901, while flying his second glider. Awareness of Lilienthal's accident and Wilbur's experience, motivated the [[Wright Brothers]] to design their plane in "[[Canard (aeronautics)|canard]]" configuration. This made recoveries from stalls easier and more gentle. The design saved the brothers' lives more than once.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/fly/1900/designing.cfm Designing the 1900 Wright Glider] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927002349/http://www.nasm.si.edu/wrightbrothers/fly/1900/designing.cfm |date=2011-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aircraft engineer [[Juan de la Cierva]] worked on his "[[Autogiro]]" project to develop a rotary wing aircraft which, he hoped, would be unable to stall and which therefore would be safer than aeroplanes. In developing the resulting "[[autogyro]]" aircraft, he solved many engineering problems which made the [[helicopter]] possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2523">In Database Management System, a '''transitive dependency''' is a [[functional dependency]] which holds by virtue of [[transitive relation|transitivity]].  A transitive dependency can occur only in a [[relation (mathematics)|relation]] that has three or more attributes.  Let A, B, and C designate three distinct attributes (or distinct collections of attributes) in the relation.  Suppose all three of the following conditions hold:

# A → B
# It is not the case that B → A
# B → C

Then the functional dependency A → C (which follows from 1 and 3 by the [[Armstrong's axioms#Axioms|axiom of transitivity]]) is a transitive dependency.

In [[database normalization]], one of the important features of [[third normal form]] is that it excludes certain types of transitive dependencies.  [[E.F. Codd]], the inventor of the [[relational model]], introduced the concepts of transitive dependence and third normal form in 1971.&lt;ref name="Codd"&gt;Codd, E.F. "Further Normalization of the Data Base Relational Model." (Presented at Courant Computer Science Symposia Series 6, "Data Base Systems," New York City, May 24th-25th, 1971.) IBM Research Report RJ909 (August 31st, 1971). Republished in Randall J. Rustin (ed.), ''Data Base Systems: Courant Computer Science Symposia Series 6''. Prentice-Hall, 1972.  See pages 45-51, which cover third normal form and transitive dependence.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
A transitive dependency occurs in the following relation:

{| class="wikitable"
! Book !! Genre !! Author !! Author Nationality
|-
|''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]]''||[[Science Fiction]]||[[Jules Verne]]||[[French people|French]]
|-
|''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]''||[[Science Fiction]]||[[Jules Verne]]||French
|-
|''[[Leaves of Grass]]''||[[Poetry]]||[[Walt Whitman]]||[[United States|American]]
|-
|''[[Anna Karenina]]''||[[Literary Fiction]]||[[Leo Tolstoy]]||[[Russians|Russian]]
|-
|''[[A Confession]]''||[[Religious Autobiography]]||[[Leo Tolstoy]]||Russian
|}

The functional dependency {Book} → {Author Nationality} applies; that is, if we know the book, we know the author's nationality.  Furthermore:

* {Book} → {Author}
* {Author} does not → {Book}
* {Author} → {Author Nationality}

Therefore {Book} → {Author Nationality} is a transitive dependency.

Transitive dependency occurred  because a non-key attribute (Author) was determining another non-key attribute (Author Nationality).

The '''Universal Short Title Catalogue''' ('''USTC''') brings together information on all books published in Europe between the invention of printing and the end of the sixteenth century, creating a powerful resource for the study of the book and print culture.

The project has a searchable interface, which brings together data from established national bibliographical projects and new projects undertaken by the project team based at the [[University of St Andrews]], with partners in [[University College, Dublin]]. This new work builds upon the principles established by the St Andrews French Vernacular Book project, completed and published in 2007 (''FB'' volumes 1 &amp; 2).

New work undertaken in St Andrews has created bibliographies of Latin books published in France (''FB'' volumes 3 &amp; 4) and of books published in the Low Countries (''NB''). The project team has also collected and analysed information on books published in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. Meanwhile, partners in University College, Dublin created a bibliography of books published in the Iberian Peninsula (''IB'').

In 2011 this was all brought together with information on books published in Italy, Germany and Britain to create a fully searchable resource covering all of Europe. This provides access to the full bibliographic information, locations of surviving copies and, where available, digital full text editions that can be accessed through the database. All told, this information encompasses approximately 350,000 editions and around 1.5 million surviving copies, located in over 5,000 libraries worldwide.

The USTC also hosts a series of conferences held annually in St Andrews in September. The project is also associated with the [http://www.brill.nl/default.aspx?partid=210&amp;pid=28864 Library of the Written Word] published by [[Brill Publishers|Brill]], also the publishers of the printed bibliographies.

The USTC is funded via a grant from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]]. A related project on medical books in the sixteenth century is funded by the [[Wellcome Trust]].

== History ==
The USTC project began as the St Andrews French Vernacular Books Project in 1997 with a survey of all books printed in the French language.

This led to a world-wide search, with the team conducting research in over 150 libraries over the course of a ten-year research project.  The St Andrews project team were able to develop a database containing information on over 52,000 editions, surviving in over 175,000 copies located in 1,600 libraries world-wide.  Of these books around thirty per cent were located only in libraries outside France; almost half, 22,000 are known only from a single surviving copy.

The project was sustained by a sequence of grants from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] and [[British Academy]].  With the most recent grant for the new USTC project, this is the largest sequence of grants won in open competition by a Humanities project at the [[University of St Andrews]].

At its conclusion the French project led to publication of a two volume hard copy short title catalogue: ''FB. French Vernacular Books.  Books published in the French language before 1601.''

== Research environment ==
The invention of printing in the fifteenth century revolutionised information culture, vastly multiplying the number of books in circulation.  It had a transforming impact on the intellectual culture of the Renaissance. The invention attracted enormous attention, and the art of printing spread quickly through the European continent. In the next 150 years publishers brought out a huge number of texts in a large range of disciplines.  These included thousands of Bibles as well as milestones of scientific publication.  Printing also stimulated the production of new types of books, such as news pamphlets, and the influential propaganda works of the Protestant Reformation. Overall this amounted to a huge volume of books: at least 350,000 separate editions, a total of around two hundred million printed items.

The history of print has always played a central role in the development of modern European society. Despite this, the knowledge base on which such interpretations are based is surprisingly flimsy.  Astonishingly, to this point, it has never been possible to create a complete survey of all printed books in the first age of print.

The corpus of materials is very large, and widely dispersed.  Many books from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries survive in only one copy.  These unique items are distributed between around 6000 separate archives and libraries around the world.

Until this point data on early printed books has been available principally through national bibliographical projects. These have achieved some notable results.  The German [[VD 16]] has gathered information on some 90,000 editions published in German lands.  The Italian [[Edit 16]] lists 60,000 editions published in Italy.  The [[English Short Title Catalogue]] is a comprehensive survey of all books published in English.

Nevertheless, this tradition of national bibliography has two main drawbacks. Firstly, national bibliographies are seldom complete.  For practical and funding reasons the German VD 16 and Italian Edit 16 both confine their searches to books presently located in German and Italian libraries respectively.  Yet sixteenth-century books were dispersed very widely; many books survive only in libraries far away from their place of production. Secondly, the coverage of Europe by these projects is far from comprehensive.

* There has as yet been no complete survey of France, the third major language  domain of early print.
* There is no survey of printing in Spain and Portugal.
* The surveys for Belgium and the Netherlands are seriously deficient.
* Printing in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia has been surveyed only in small disparate projects dealing with a single language domain (Bohemia, Denmark, Hungary).  There is no survey for Poland.

The USTC will make good these deficiencies in a project with two strands by completing the coverage of European print by gathering comprehensive date on all parts of Europe lacking such a survey. Finally, the USTC will co-ordinate the merging of these resources with other cognate projects into a coherent, unified searchable database.

The '''School of Humanities''' is one of the [[Faculty (division)|academic units]] of the [[University of California, Irvine]]. 
Upon the school's opening in 1965, the '''Division of Humanities''' was one of the five liberal arts divisions that the campus had to offer. Samuel McCulloch was appointed as UC Irvine's founding dean of Humanities 1953.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;https://www.humanities.uci.edu/SOH/about/history.php&lt;/ref&gt; The School hosts the [[Thesaurus Linguae Graecae]]&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; and the [[University of California Humanities Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;http://uchri.org/uchri/about-uchri/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The division of humanities is one of the five liberal arts divisions that opened with the campus in 1965. In 1963, Samuel McCulloch was appointed as the founding dean of UC Irvine Division of Humanities and laid its foundation. Upon the campus' opening day, he created four departments within the divion with a total of thirty-one faculty members. The four departments were: English and Comparative Literature, Foreign Languages and Literature, History, and Philosophy. By 1967, the governing body of UC Irvine turned the five liberal arts divisions into individual schools and the Division of Humanities had become the School of Humanities. In 1970 the Humanities Core Course was implemented and there was a focus on strengthening existing Humanities departments for the rest of the 1970s. The school also launched a doctorate in Critical Theory, making UC Irvine to be the only university in the country to offer a doctorate in the field.
In the 1980s, Dean Ken Bailes founded the Organized Research Unit in Critical Theory and brought the system wide University of California Humanities Research Institute to UC Irvine. The School of Humanities started gaining national recognition and it expanded and grew throughout the 1990s and 2000s. The Humanities Instructional Building and Humanities Gateway were built and completed the Humanities Quad. The school today continues to expand by adding special programs and by creating cross collaboration with different schools on campus. The school has a total of 13 departments and over 20 majors and several interdisciplinary programs.

The '''College of Information Studies''' (''Maryland's [[iSchool]]'') is a graduate school located at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] in [[Maryland]], United States. The College offers graduate study leading to the [[Master of Library and Information Science]] (MLIS), the [[Master of Information Management]] (MIM), the Master of Science in Human Computer Interaction (HCIM), and the Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in [[Information Science|Information Studies]]. In addition, they offer the Bachelor of Science in Information Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ischool.umd.edu/infosci|title=Bachelor of Science in Information Science (InfoSci)|last=adi1710|date=2016-07-14|work=ISchool|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The College of Information Studies focuses on creating new designs and addressing issues  involving Information Management.&lt;ref&gt;https://ischool.umd.edu/what-ischool&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The iSchool was founded in 1965 with Paul Wasserman as its first dean.  Wasserman, a former military man who was part of the [[Invasion of Normandy]], held the post for 5 years.  Wasserman was very supportive of research and the school became the first [[Information school]] to require a technology course.  Wasserman saw technology as a tool for information management.  Wasserman was a librarian, and his broad vision helped the program get on its feet.  He was constantly traveling and recruiting international faculty members and students.  Wasserman would later write an autobiography which is available at [[University of Maryland Libraries|McKeldin Library]].  The school's original name was the School of Library and Information Services and by 1972 it had established its location in Hornbake Library's South Wing.  The school attained full accreditation from the [[American Library Association]] (it has never lost its accreditation) in 1966 and the first PhD students were in 1967.

In 1991 the school had a [[#Crisis of 1991|major crisis]] as it was very close to being shut down.

In 1993 Ann Prentice became dean of the school.  During this time period the University of Maryland's Provost prompted a general review of the school and a reexamination of the goals and mission statement.  The Provost wanted to promote more innovation, creation, research and services.  Therefore, the school went through significant changes as the MLS curriculum was revised and the school started to morph into what it is now, an iSchool.  Bruce Dearstyne took over as Interim Dean in 2001, after Prentice retired, and the transformation continued under his leadership.  His signature initiative was introduction of the [[Master of Information Management]] program (MIM).  In 2005, [[Jenny Preece]] became Dean.  Under Preece, the MIM program has grown substantially.  In the 2007 school year the MIM program had its highest student body count at 149.  In addition, under Preece's directorship, a new master's program was added, Master of Science in Human-Computer Interaction.

In the summer of 2015, Brian Butler took over as interim dean as [[Jenny Preece]] stepped down. [[Keith Marzullo]] is the new incoming dean from the summer of 2016.

===List of Deans===
*Paul Wasserman:  1965-1970
*Jean Diepenbrock:  1986-1991
*Ann Prentice:  1993-2001
*Bruce Dearstyne:  2001-2005
*[[Jenny Preece]]:  2005–2015
*Brian Butler: 2015-2016
*[[Keith Marzullo]]: 2016-onwards

==Challenges==
The iSchool has faced several challenges throughout its history.

===Crisis of 1991===
In the 1980s there was heated debate over whether Library Schools should be a part of major research-oriented universities.  The University of Chicago's Graduate Library School was closed in 1989 and its closing was attributed to "the divorce of the School's research activities from what the profession perceived as its needs for training."  Shortly thereafter, in 1990, Columbia University's School of Library Service was closed.  There were reports of fierce opposition from tenured faculty to sever ties to all library communities and reorient priorities to support newly emerging information communities as well as deemphasize professionally relevant education and practitioner connections.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Bill. Spanning the Theory-Practice Divide in Library &amp; Information Science. Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;     In 1991, coupled with the economic downturn (the University had implemented furloughs as well) there was a call for the iSchool at Maryland to be shut down.  It was proposed that the school became a department rather than a self-standing college.  There was a public, open meeting where the issue was debated.  The school was given support by Representative [[Steny Hoyer]].  In addition, past deans, faculty and alumni were on hand to counter the proposal.  Former students spoke up in defense of the program, attributing their successes in public service jobs to the college's educational programs.  The school was able to avoid being shut down.

===Transition Phase===
In the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), there was a period of transition within the iSchool.  There was a general realization that the field was changing and that the business model was changing.  With the advent of the Web and search engines there were changes in how information was being gathered and consumed.  There would be more of a demand for "Information Technology Professionals" rather than Librarians.  During this time, there was a lot of funding going to the Human Computer Interaction Lab at the University and with the perceived growth of technology the lab was moved into the South wing of Hornbake Library where the iSchool was located.  This move caused some tension as the iSchool's teaching library was disbanded and in its place faculty offices and research facilities were set up to accommodate the growth of the school.  There was a fight to keep the iSchool's library - there were protests and petitions but none were fruitful and the library was removed from Hornbake.  There was a recognized opportunity to train professionals for the corporate world and so when Dearstyne took over he helped lead the school as it introduced the new MIM program.  Some faculty felt like the school was abandoning its "ontology" and abandoning libraries as an institution.  There wasn't necessarily resistance to the MIM but rather to a second master's program in general.  The question, "not will it be" but "what will it be" defined the debates.  Despite initial concerns, the school has seen a steady rise in acceptance and interest.  2007 was a record year for the MIM program in number of students (149).  In 2009 U.S. News &amp; World Report recognized Maryland’s iSchool as one of the top information schools in the country, ranking it 10th among all public universities &lt;ref name="US News and World Report Ranking"&gt;http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-information-science-rankings&lt;/ref&gt;

Its goal is to educate students in an interdisciplinary curriculum with aspects from computer science, business, and psychology. In the iSchool, this bachelors program is meant to focus on how "information, people, and technology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ischool.umd.edu/infosci|title=Bachelor of Science in Information Science (InfoSci)|last=adi1710|date=2016-07-14|work=ISchool|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;" come together within the field of Information Science. Undergraduate students focused on this major will learn skills related to online website development essential to the work force. These skills include database design, web and mobile development, and data analytics. These students will also prepare for leadership and management roles while taking humanities classes and engaging in internships.  &lt;ref&gt;https://ischool.umd.edu/infosci&lt;/ref&gt;

===MLIS===
The Master of Library &amp; Information Science Program educates students in the knowledge, skills, habits of thought and inquiry, and ethics of the library and information professions to enable them to be leaders in the state, national, and global information society.
The program for the MLIS degree requires 36 credit hours of academic work to be completed with a minimum average of B within five calendar years from the first registration. In the non -thesis option, all credits are coursework. The thesis option requires 30 credits of coursework and six credits of thesis research. The usual and recommended course of study for a full-time student is approximately 18–24 months. The program offers three specializations and a few concentrations.

====Specializations====

=====Archives, Records and Information Management=====
The specialization meets all requirements recommended for archival education by the [[Society of American Archivists]] (SAA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Maryland {{!}} SAA|url=http://www2.archivists.org/dae/university-of-maryland|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies|url=http://www2.archivists.org/standards/guidelines-for-a-graduate-program-in-archival-studies|publisher=Society of American Archivists|accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====School Library Media=====
The specialization accomplishes this mission by :
*Providing intellectual and physical access to materials in all formats.
*Providing instruction to foster competence and stimulate interest in reading, viewing and using information and ideas.
*Working with other educators to design learning strategies to meet the needs of individual students.
Students who complete this specialization earn the State of Maryland Library Media Specialist Certification, as the SLM specialization curriculum fulfills the requirements of the certificate (with the exception of 3 credits in learning theory and 3 credits in classroom techniques required of students who do not have a teaching backgrounds.)

=====Curation and Management of Digital Assets=====
The specialization, beginning in the fall of 2013, focuses on managing digital information and material.&lt;ref&gt;http://ischool.umd.edu/content/curation-and-management-digital-assets&lt;/ref&gt;

====Concentrations====

=====E-Government=====
Focuses on the nature, current impacts, and potential future impacts of e-government, also known as digital government or electronic government. E-government is the use of the Internet and other information and communication technologies by governments to provide information and services, as well as to use as channels of communication to citizens, businesses, and other governments.

=====Lifelong Access=====
Focuses on the information behavior of individuals as members of a defined group. Groups may be defined by age (i.e., young children, youth, adults, seniors); life activities (i.e., elementary students, undergraduates, parents, caregivers); job or profession (i.e., physicians, chemists, teachers, scholars); avocation or hobby (i.e., genealogist, sports coach, amateur chef); and numerous other attributes (i.e., newly arrived immigrants, consumers, medical patients).

=====Information and Diverse Populations=====
Focuses on instruction about and research into the design, development, provision and integration of information services, resources, technologies and outreach that serve diverse populations.

===MIM===
The MIM program trains information technology professionals who know how to strategically manage information and technology and who understand the issues of information management, business management, computer science, and information systems.  The MIM degree requires 36 credit hours of academic work to be completed with a minimum average of B within five calendar years from the first registration. A unique component of the MIM program is the pair of project courses taken at the end of the coursework. One of the courses involves a team project focused on solving an actual information management project at a real-world organization, and the other is an individual project. Each of these courses carry three credits, and require about 120 hours of work per student over a regular semester of three months.

====Tracks====

=====Strategic Management of Information=====
The Strategic Management of Information Concentration is intended for those students who want to follow the “CIO” (Chief Information Officer) or general management path. This concentration is designed for professionals who require a strong understanding of the role of information and technology in the management and operation of the organization, but who are not directly involved in the actual development of applications or systems. This track reflects the original, single-track structure of the MIM program as it was introduced in August 2003. The other two tracks were added to the program in January 2007.

=====Socio-Tech Information Systems=====
The Socio-Tech Information Systems Concentration is intended for those students who want to follow the “CTO” (Chief Technology Officer) or director of technology development path. This concentration is designed for professionals who require a basic understanding of management issues and who are actively involved in the actual development of applications or systems.

=====Individual Program Plan=====
The Individual Program Plan is intended for those students who want to follow the “internal advancement” path as information professionals. It provides a foundation of general knowledge in Information Management and Technology, with the ability for customization for their particular circumstances, in order to advance within their current profession and organization.

===HCIM===
The Master of Science in Human-Computer Interaction degree integrates information studies, computer science, education, psychology and engineering to prepare HCI leaders of the future.  Through coursework and research experiences, students in this program will develop skills in:
*Fundamentals of Human-Computer Interaction
*Advanced research methods
*Usability analysis and testing
*Social computing strategies and technologies
*Technology design

===Doctoral Program===
Students must complete a minimum of 25 graduate credit hours while matriculated at the University of Maryland (or 28 hours if basic statistics is taken as a graduate course). Course-work will be taken in three areas of study which include: Information Studies (6 credit hours); Research Methods and Design (10 credit hours) and specialized area(s) (9 credit hours).
All students have a First Year Review the first full academic year that a student takes his/her first doctoral seminar. Students prepare a portfolio that self-evaluates progress. This may include papers written for coursework or research, a presentation on a research topic and/or reviews by previous course instructors. A committee of at least three faculty members, a majority of whom must be members of the iSchool faculty, will review the work and inform the student in writing of the results.

Students do not take comprehensive exams, but instead write an Integrative Paper that synthesizes and applies knowledge from broad areas of the information field. A committee of at least three faculty members, a majority of whom must be members of the iSchool faculty, approves the topic and abstract of the paper, and certifies its successful completion. The paper will typically be written after completion of coursework or equivalent experience (e.g., extensive work in a research environment) and must be completed and approved before advancement to candidacy.

Students are required to successfully defend a dissertation to complete the program.

He has introduced anthropological insights and themes to the history of medicine and science; developed innovative frameworks for the analysis of science and globalisation; and conducted historical research into the material cultures of scientific exchange. His influential formulation of the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial studies]] of science and medicine has generated a new style of inquiry within [[science and technology studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Seth S. Putting knowledge in its place: science, colonialism, and the postcolonial, ''Postcolonial Studies'' Special Issue: Science, Colonialism, Postcolonialism 12(4): 373–83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==

Anderson was born and educated in [[Melbourne]], Australia, where he attended the [[University High School, Melbourne|University High School]]. His father, Hugh McDonald Anderson (1927-2017), was a leading [[folklorist]] and historian of Australian popular and literary culture, with more than forty books to his credit; his mother, Dawn Anderson, has written books on drama education and creativity.

He graduated from the University of Melbourne Medical School (M.B., B.S. [equivalent to the US M.D.]) in 1983. During the medical course he conducted neurophysiology research, supervised by Ian Darian-Smith, which earned him the B.Med.Sc. (1980). He was an intern at the [[Royal Melbourne Hospital]], and had paediatric training at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, and the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], Oxford. In the 1986 season he was the assistant doctor for the [[Footscray Football Club]] (now the AFL Bulldogs). From 1987, he worked in general practice in the inner west of Melbourne, which he continued intermittently until 1999. 
 
Anderson ("Dr. Androgen") was a co-presenter on the award-winning radio program "Spoonful of Medicine" ([[3RRR]]) from 1987–88.

== Poetry ==

As a medical student, Anderson began writing and publishing poetry. More than forty poems have appeared in a range of leading journals in Australia and the US. His poetry collection, ''Hard Cases, Brief Lives'' (Adelaide: Ginninderra, 2011) was short-listed in 2012 for the Mary Gilmore Award of the Association for the Study of Australian Literature (ASAL).&lt;ref&gt;Anderson W.

Retrieved 13 November 2–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of medicine and science ==

Anderson completed a PhD in the Department of the History and Sociology of Science at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1992. His dissertation was on US colonial medicine and public health in the [[Philippines]], and his advisor was [[Charles E. Rosenberg]]. Before moving to Sydney, Anderson held appointments at [[Harvard University]] (1992–95); the University of Melbourne (1995–2000); [[UCSF]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] (2000–2003); and the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] (2003–08). At Melbourne, he founded the Centre for Health and Society (1997)&lt;ref&gt;[http://chs.unimelb.edu.au/ "Melbourne School of Population and Global Health: Centre for Health and Society"], "University of Melbourne". Retrieved 18 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and helped to establish the Onemda VicHealth Koori Health Unit (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onemda.unimelb.edu.au/ "Onemda VicHealth Koori Health Unit"], "University of Melbourne". Retrieved 18 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At Madison, he was chair of the Department of Medical History and Bioethics.

He was the founding editor of ''Health and History'' (1998), and served as associate editor for the ''East Asian STS Journal'' and ''Postcolonial Studies''. He served on the councils of the American Association of the History of Medicine (AAHM), the Australian and New Zealand Society for the History of Medicine, the Australian Society of Health, Law and Ethics, History of Medicine in Southeast Asia (HOMSEA), the Institute of Postcolonial Studies (Melbourne), and the Pacific Circle.

Anderson was awarded a fellowship from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Foundation]] (2007–08), and he was a Frederick Burkhardt Fellow of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (2005–06), which he held at the [[Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton]]. In 2013 he was a Whitney J. Oates Fellow at the Humanities Council, Princeton University and a John Hope Franklin Fellow at Duke University.

The '''École Polytechnique massacre''', also known as the '''Montreal massacre''', was a [[mass shooting]] at the [[École Polytechnique de Montréal|École Polytechnique]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada that occurred on December 6, 1989. Twenty-five-year-old [[Marc Lépine]], armed with a rifle and a [[hunting knife]], shot 28 people, killing 14 women, before committing suicide. He began his attack by entering a classroom at the university, where he separated the male and female students. After claiming that he was "fighting [[feminism]]" and calling the women "a bunch of feminists," he shot all nine women in the room, killing six. He then moved through corridors, the cafeteria, and another classroom, specifically targeting women to shoot. Overall, he killed fourteen women and injured ten other women and four men in just under 20 minutes before turning the gun on himself.&lt;!-- Most websources including media reports say 13, but a careful check of the coroner's report indicates that there were 14 wounded: one arrived at hospital by foot and was presumably only mildly injured, and therefore probably did not get onto the list of wounded referenced here. Please see http://www.diarmani.com/Montreal_Coroners_Report.pdf and confirm it for yourself!!--&gt; [[Marc Lépine#Suicide statement|His suicide note]] claimed political motives and blamed feminists for ruining his life. The note included a list of 19 Quebec women whom Lépine considered to be feminists and apparently wished to kill. It is the deadliest mass shooting in Canadian history.

Since the attack, Canadians have debated various interpretations of the events, their significance, and Lépine's motives. Many feminist groups and public officials have characterized the [[massacre]] as an anti-feminist attack that is representative of wider societal [[violence against women]]. Consequently, the anniversary of the massacre has since been commemorated as the [[National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women]]. Other interpretations emphasize Lépine's abuse as a child or suggest that the massacre was simply the isolated act of a madman, unrelated to larger social issues. Still other commentators have blamed violence in the media and increasing poverty, isolation, and alienation in society, particularly in immigrant communities.

The incident led to more stringent [[gun control]] laws in Canada. It also introduced changes in the tactical response of police to shootings, changes which were later credited with minimizing casualties at the 2006 [[Dawson College shooting]]s.

==Massacre==
Sometime after 4&amp;nbsp;p.m. on December 6, 1989, [[Marc Lépine]] arrived at the building housing the École Polytechnique, an engineering school affiliated with the [[Université de Montréal]], armed with a [[semi-automatic rifle]] and a [[hunting knife]].&lt;ref name="coroner"&gt;Sourour, Teresa K., (1991) [http://www.diarmani.com/Montreal_Coroners_Report.pdf Report of Coroner's Investigation] (PDF). Retrieved on December 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He had purchased a rifle on November 21, 1989, in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal, telling the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last =Weston| first =Greg| title =Why? We may never know|work=Toronto Sun| date = September 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lépine was familiar with the layout of the building since he had been in and around the École Polytechnique at least seven times in the weeks leading up to the event.&lt;ref name="coroner"/&gt;

[[File:Exterior of Ecole Polytechnique de Montreal.jpg|thumb|left|Exterior of École Polytechnique de Montréal|alt= oblique view of a long, modern building about 6 storeys high, with many windows and large main entrance]]

Lépine sat for a time in the office of the registrar on the second floor. He was seen rummaging through a plastic bag and did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. He left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10&amp;nbsp;p.m.&lt;ref name="coroner"/&gt; After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Gunman massacres 14 women| work =Archives| publisher =CBC| date = December 6, 1989| url =http://archives.cbc.ca/society/crime_justice/topics/398-2235/| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110604052652/http://archives.cbc.ca/society/crime_justice/topics/398-2235/| archivedate =2011-06-04| format =video stream| accessdate =December 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave.&lt;ref name="cernea"&gt;{{cite book|title=Poly 1989: Témoin de l'horreur|last=Cernea|first=Adrian|publisher=Éditions Lescop|year=1999|isbn=2-9804832-8-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking in French, he asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied "no," he answered: "I am fighting feminism." One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, "Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life." Lépine responded, "You're women, you're going to be engineers. You're all a bunch of feminists. I hate feminists." He then opened fire on the students from left to right, killing six, and wounding three others, including Provost.&lt;ref name="coroner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chun"/&gt;  Before leaving the room, he wrote ''shit'' twice on a student project.&lt;ref name="cernea"/&gt;

Lépine continued into the second-floor corridor and wounded three students before entering another room where he twice attempted to shoot a female student. When his weapon failed to fire, he entered the emergency staircase where he was seen reloading his gun. He returned to the room he had just left, but the students had locked the door; Lépine failed to unlock it with three shots fired into the door. Moving along the corridor, he shot at others, wounding one, before moving towards the financial services office where he shot and killed a woman through the window of the door she had just locked.&lt;ref name="coroner"/&gt;

He next went down to the first-floor cafeteria, in which about a hundred people were gathered. The crowd scattered after he shot a woman standing near the kitchens and wounded another student. Entering an unlocked storage area at the end of the cafeteria, Lépine shot and killed two more women hiding there. He told a male and female student to come out from under a table; they complied and were not shot.&lt;ref name="coroner"/&gt;

Lépine then walked up an escalator to the third floor where he shot and wounded one female and two male students in the corridor. He entered another classroom and told the three students giving a presentation to "get out," shooting and wounding Maryse Leclair, who was standing on the low platform at the front of the classroom. He fired on students in the front row and then killed two women who were trying to escape the room, while other students dived under their desks. Lépine moved towards some of the female students, wounding three of them and killing another. He changed the [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] in his weapon and moved to the front of the class, shooting in all directions. At this point, the wounded Leclair asked for help; Lépine unsheathed his hunting knife and stabbed her three times, killing her. He took off his cap, wrapped his coat around his rifle, exclaimed, "Ah shit," and then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, twenty minutes after having begun his attack.&lt;ref name="injured"&gt;{{cite news | last =Buchignani| first =Walter| title =Amid the tragedy, miracles of survival| page = A3| newspaper = [[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |location =Montreal| date =December 8, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; About sixty unfired cartridges remained in the boxes he carried with him.

==Perpetrator==
The shooter, [[Marc Lépine]], was born to a [[French Canadians|French-Canadian]] mother and an [[Algeria]]n father and at birth he was named Gamil Gharbi. His father, a mutual funds salesman, did not consider women to be the equal of men.

==Search for a rationale==
The massacre profoundly shocked Canadians. Government and criminal justice officials feared that extensive public discussion about the massacre would cause pain to the families and lead to antifeminist violence.&lt;ref name="Chun" /&gt; As a result, a public inquiry was not held,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Malarek| first =Victor| title =More Massacre Details to be Released by Police, but an Inquiry Ruled Out| page =A14|work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada | date = December 12, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Marc Lépine's suicide letter was not officially released.

===Police response===
Police response to the shootings was heavily criticized for the amount of time it gave Lépine to carry out the massacre.

===Gun control===

The massacre was a major spur for the Canadian gun control movement.&lt;ref name="Dec6"&gt;{{cite book| last =Rathjen| first =Heidi|author2=Charles Montpetit | title =December 6: From the Montreal Massacre to Gun Control| publisher =McClelland &amp; Stewart| year =1999 |location =Toronto| isbn = 0-7710-6125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heidi Rathjen, a student who was in one of the classrooms Lépine did not enter during the shooting, organized the Coalition for Gun Control with Wendy Cukier.&lt;ref name="Dec6" /&gt; Suzanne Laplante-Edward and Jim Edward, the parents of one of the victims, were also deeply involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Boyd| first =Denny| title =Couple salvages purpose from their daughter's tragic death|page =B1|work=Vancouver Sun | date = April 20, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their activities, along with others, led to the passage of Bill C-68, or the [[Firearms Act, 1995|Firearms Act]], in 1995, ushering in stricter gun control regulations.&lt;ref name="Dec6" /&gt; These new regulations included requirements on the training of gun owners, screening of firearm applicants, rules concerning gun and ammunition storage and the [[Canadian gun registry|registration of all firearms]].  Between 2009 and 2012, survivors of the massacre and their families publicly opposed legislative actions by [[Stephen Harper]]'s [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government aimed at ending the requirement to register non-restricted firearms (commonly referred to as the "long-gun registry").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Susan|last=Delacourt|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/734816--long-gun-registry-politics-taint-service-for-the-victims |title=Long-gun registry politics taint service for the victims |work=Toronto Star |accessdate=December 6, 2009 |date= December 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Violence against women===
The Canadian women's movement sees the massacre as a symbol of [[violence against women]]. "The death of those young women would not be in vain, we promised", Canadian feminist [[Judy Rebick]] recalled. "We would turn our mourning into organizing to put an end to male violence against women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Rebick| first =Judy| title = Where's the funding for abused women?| publisher =CBC| date = December 6, 2000| url =http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/columns/rebick/rebick001206.html | accessdate =March 7, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070321225539/http://www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/columns/rebick/rebick001206.html |archivedate = March 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the killings, a House of Commons Sub-Committee on the Status of Women was created. It released a report "The War against Women" in June 1991, which was not endorsed by the full standing committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Vienneau| first =David| title =Probe on violence toward women blocked| page =A4 |work=Toronto Star| date =January 19, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Hooks|first1=Tess|last2=LeClerc| first2= Patrice|last3= Beaujot|first3= Roderic|title=Female well-being: toward a global theory of social change|editor=Janet Mancini Billson, Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban|publisher=Zed Books|pages=102–103|isbn= 978-1-84277-009-2 |chapter= Women in Canada: a century of struggle| url=https://books.google.com/?id=a_2eWZK63_8C&amp;pg=PA102|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, following its recommendations, the federal government established the Canadian Panel on Violence Against Women in August 1991. The panel issued a final report, "Changing the Landscape: Ending Violence – Achieving Equality", in June 1993. The panel proposed a two-pronged "National Action Plan" consisting of an "Equality Action Plan" and a "Zero Tolerance Policy" designed to increase women's equality and reduce violence against women through government policy. Critics of the panel said that the plan failed to provide a workable timeline and strategy for implementation and that with over four hundred recommendations, the final report failed to make an impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Harder| first = Sandra | title = Violence against women: the Canadian Panel's final report | publisher = Government of Canada | url =http://publications.gc.ca/collections/Collection-R/LoPBdP/MR/mr122-e.htm | accessdate =February 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
====Failure to intervene====
[[File:Montreal massacre memorial at McMaster University.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Memorial at John Hodgins Engineering Building, [[McMaster University]]|alt= a roughly edged flat grey stone inscribed with the names of the women murdered, and dedicated by the engineering community at McMaster]]
Male survivors of the massacre have been subjected to criticism for not intervening to stop Lépine. In an interview immediately after the event, a reporter asked one of the men why they "abandoned" the women when it was clear that Lépine's targets were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lakeman |first=Lee |title=Women, Violence and the Montreal Massacre |publisher=Vancouver Rape Relief and Women's Shelter |url=http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/dec6/leearticle.html |accessdate=April 20, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419184040/http://www.rapereliefshelter.bc.ca/dec6/leearticle.html |archivedate=April 19, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[René Marc Jalbert|René Jalbert]], the [[Sergeant-at-Arms|sergeant-at-arms]] who persuaded Denis Lortie to surrender during his 1984 attack, said that someone should have intervened at least to distract Lépine, but acknowledged that "ordinary citizens cannot be expected to react heroically in the midst of terror."&lt;ref name="macleans" /&gt;  Right wing newspaper columnist [[Mark Steyn]] suggested that male inaction during the massacre illustrated a "culture of passivity" prevalent among men in Canada, which enabled Lépine's shooting spree: "Yet the defining image of contemporary Canadian maleness is not M Lepine/Gharbi but the professors and the men in that classroom, who, ordered to leave by the lone gunman, meekly did so, and abandoned their female classmates to their fate—an act of abdication that would have been unthinkable in almost any other culture throughout human history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Steyn |first=Mark| title = A Culture of Passivity| publisher = National Review| date = April 18, 2007 | url = http://www.nationalreview.com/article/220650/culture-passivity-mark-steyn| accessdate =April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Male students and staff expressed feelings of remorse for not having attempted to prevent the shootings,&lt;ref name="cernea" /&gt; but Nathalie Provost, one of the survivors, said that she felt that nothing could have been done to prevent the tragedy, and that her fellow students should not feel guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Kastor| first =Elizabeth| title =In Montreal, A Survivor Heals After The Horror; 23-Year-Old Student Tried To Reason With Killer| newspaper =The Washington Post| page = B1|date =December 11, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interpretation====
The feminist movement is periodically criticized for appropriating the massacre as a symbol of male violence against women. For example, [[Charles Rackoff]], a [[University of Toronto]] [[computer science]] professor, compared the [[Ku Klux Klan]] with those organizing vigils marking the event, writing that "[t]he point is to use the death of these people as an excuse to promote the feminist/extreme left-wing agenda," and adding that it is "no more justified" than the KKK using the "murder of a white person by a black person as an excuse to promote their agenda."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = CBC news| title = Professor criticizes Montreal massacre memorials | publisher = CBC| date = December 7, 2000 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2000/12/07/massacre_email001207.html| accessdate =March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other critics say that Lépine was a "lone gunman" who does not represent men, and that violence against women is neither condoned nor encouraged officially or unofficially in western culture. In this perspective, feminist memorializing is considered socially divisive on the basis of gender and therefore harmful by bestowing guilt on all men, irrespective of individual propensity to violence against women.&lt;ref name="kay"&gt;{{cite news| last = Kay| first = Barbara| title = Lone gunman: The Ecole Polytechnique massacre was a freak tragedy.

==Memorials{{Anchor|Commemoration}}==
Since 1991, the anniversary of the massacre has been designated the [[National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women]], intended as a call to action against discrimination against women.&lt;ref name = "Day"/&gt;  A [[White Ribbon Campaign]] was launched in 1991 by a group of men in [[London, Ontario]], in the wake of the massacre, for the purpose of raising awareness about the prevalence of male violence against women, with the ribbon symbolizing "the idea of men giving up their arms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Men wearing white ribbons| publisher =CBC| date = November 27, 1991|url =http://archives.cbc.ca/society/crime_justice/topics/398-2240/|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110629023429/http://archives.cbc.ca/society/crime_justice/topics/398-2240/|archivedate =2011-06-29| accessdate =March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commemorative demonstrations are held across the country each year on December 6 in memory of the slain women and numerous memorials have been built.&lt;ref name="citynews"/&gt;

The Place du 6-Décembre-1989 in the [[Côte-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Grâce]] borough of Montreal was created as a memorial to the victims of the massacre. Located at the corner of Decelles Avenue and [[Queen Mary Road (Montreal)|Queen Mary Road]], a short distance from the university, it includes the art installation ''Nef pour quatorze reines'' (''[[Nave]] for Fourteen Queens'') by Rose-Marie Goulet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = CBC news| title = Monument to slain women unveiled | publisher = CBC| date =December 5, 1999 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1999/12/05/memorialsun991205.html  | accessdate =January 4, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071111062104/http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/1999/12/05/memorialsun991205.html |archivedate = November 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the site of annual commemorations on December 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Young, Katherine K. |author2=Nathanson, Paul |title=Legalizing misandry: from public shame to systematic discrimination against men |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |location=Montreal |year=2006 |pages= 69–70|isbn=0-7735-2862-8 |oclc= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=cqKxhhu55SMC&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
