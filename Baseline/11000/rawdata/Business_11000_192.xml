      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4845">{{Primarysources|article|date=November 2011}}{{Nofootnotes|article|date=November 2011}}'''Agency worker law''' refers to a body of law which regulates the conduct of [[employment agencies]] and the [[labour law]] rights of people who get jobs through them. The typical situation involves the person going to an employment agency and then the employment agency sending the person to an actual employer for proper work.

==History==
The [[International Labour Organization]] called for the establishment of public employment agencies in their place. To prevent the abusive practices of private agencies, they were to be fully abolished or at least tightly regulated. In most countries, they are legal but regulated.

Probably inspired by the dissenting judgments in a [[United States Supreme Court]] case called ''[[Adams v. Tanner]]'', the [[International Labour Organization]]'s first ever Recommendation was targeted at fee-charging agencies. The Unemployment Recommendation, 1919 (No.1), Art. 1 called for each member to

&lt;blockquote&gt;"take measures to prohibit the establishment of employment agencies which charge fees or which carry on their business for profit. Where such agencies already exist, it is further recommended that they be permitted to operate only under government licenses, and that all practicable measures be taken to abolish such agencies as soon as possible."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Unemployment Convention, 1919]], Art. 2 required instead the alternative of 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"a system of free public employment agencies under the control of a central authority. Committees, which shall include representatives of employers and workers, shall be appointed to advise on matters concerning the carrying on of these agencies."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1933, the [[Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention, 1933 (shelved)|Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention (No.34)]] formally called for abolition. The exception was if the agencies were licensed and a fee scale was agreed in advance. In 1949, a [[Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention (Revised), 1949|new revised Convention (No.96)]] was produced. That kept the same scheme but secured an ‘opt out’ (Art. 2) for members that did not wish to sign up. Agencies were an increasingly entrenched part of the labor market. The United States did not sign up to the Conventions. The latest Convention, the [[Private Employment Agencies Convention, 1997]] (No.181) takes a much softer stance and calls merely for regulation.

==Particular jurisdictions==
===European Union===
 The problem related to the Temporary agency work in Europe has formally achieved its maturity through the implementation of the Council Directive 2008/104/ECafter nearly three decades of debate. In this way, the directive as being the third part of the European Union's employment law package to protect atypical working ( which includes part-time workers and fixed-term workers), aims  both to establish a suitable framework for the use of temporary agency work and to develop a flexible form of working.

===Germany===
In Germany the [[:de:Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz|''Arbeitnehmerüberlassungsgesetz'']] (Employee Hiring Law of 1972) regulates the agency relationship. It Following the provisions in the ''[[Burgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'' (Civil Code) on the law of leasing goods or finance, the agency relationship is seen as a triangular arrangement, with different obligations on each side. The worker is an employee of the agency only. The contract between the agency and the end-employer is termed as a hire of labour. Between the worker and the end-employer there is no contract. There is only a statutory obligation to give equal treatment in terms and conditions of work.

===United Kingdom===
{{main|UK agency worker law}}
The UK's main piece of legislation falls under the [[Employment Agencies Act 1973]], which required licensing until 1994. There is an exception, for employment agencies working in the agricultural, shellfishing and food packing sectors, under the [[Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004]].

===United States===
*''[[Adams v. Tanner]]''
* In ''[[Ribnik v. McBride]]'', 277 US 350 (1928) the Court struck down a similar New Jersey law attempting to regulate agencies, Justices Stone, Brandeis and Holmes dissenting. This is probably no longer good law.
*Doubt was placed on the leading dicta of ''[[Adams v. Tanner]]'' in ''[[Olsen v. State of Nebraska]]'' 313 US 236 (1941) and ''[[Lincoln Union v. Northwestern Co.]]'', 335 US 525 (1949) 535. In the latter, Mr Justice Black, said that ''Adams v. Tanner'' was part of the "constitutional philosophy" which struck down [[minimum wage]]s and maximum working hours.

'''Albert Ludvig Lindsay von Julin''' (2 August 1871 — 8 May 1944) was a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[engineer]], [[businessman]] and [[vuorineuvos]].

Julin was born in [[Pohja]] to an industrial family. After his studies he spent for few years gaining work experience in [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Caucasus]], after which he returned in Finland to manage his family business, the [[Fiskars]] company. Julin led the company for almost 40 years growing it one of the largest companies of Finland.

Julin had also a significant role at creating the Finnish [[employers' association]]s. He took part in the last [[Diet of Finland]] in 1904–1905 and in local politics in Pohja.

== Early life and studies ==
Julin was born in [[Fiskars, Finland|Fiskars]], [[Pohja]]; his parents were [[Emil Lindsay von Julin]], manager and co-owner of the local [[Fiskars]] [[ironworks]], and Hildur [[née]] Kistner. Julin family was an influential Finnish industrialist family. He graduated in 1890 in private Finland-Swedish [[Lyceum#Finland|reallyceum]] in [[Hamina]]. Julin went to study in Faculty of Chemistry in [[Helsinki University of Technology|Finnish Polytechnical Institute]] and he graduated [[engineer]] in 1894. He continued his studies in [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]] and graduated as mining engineer in 1895. Subsequently, Julin travelled around Europe visiting number of mining and engineering companies. He worked for [[Branobel]] in [[Baku]], [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Caucasus]] in 1896–1900.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: A. L. v. Julin"/&gt;

== Fiskars ==
Julin returned to Finland in 1900 and became engineer in Fiskars. In 1904 he was appointed managing director and in 1906 he became the company general director. Julin invested on the premises and took over a number of companies, such as Billnäs Bruks, Tyko Bruks, Inha Bruks and Finska Bult. The subsidiaries continued operation as independent units. By year 1920 Fiskars had regained its position as a significant company, being the tenth largest company of the newly independent Finland and the second largest [[engineering]] company after the [[VR Group|State Railways]] Engineering Works.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: A. L. v. Julin"/&gt;

Julin managed Fiskars for almost 40 years, until 1942. As a manager he was an old-school industrialist who was against [[labourism]]; however, he was respected as a manager and negotiation partner by his employees. Albert Lindsay von Julin was the last director of the company from the Julin family.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: A. L. v. Julin"/&gt;

== Organisational activities ==
Julin was founding member of the 1903 created Finnish Engineering Industry Employers' Association,&lt;!-- Suomen Metalliteollisuuden työnantajaliitto  --&gt; and he was one of the employers' leaders in the [[industrial action]]s which emerged in the early 20th century. In 1908 he took part in founding the Finnish Engineering Industry Bureau&lt;!-- Suomen Metalliteollisuuskonttori --&gt; and later the Finnish Industry Bureau. Julin was involved in creation of Finnish Engineering Industry Association&lt;!-- Suomen Metalliteollisuusyhdistys--&gt; and in 1921 formed Finnish Industry Federation;&lt;!-- Suomen Teollisuusliitto --&gt; he was a long-term member in the both organisations.&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: A. L. v. Julin"/&gt;

== Political career ==
Julin was municipality council member in Pohja and supported the local folk college. He took part in the last [[Diet of Finland]] in 1905–1906 as member of the [[Finnish nobility|nobility]].&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: A. L. v. Julin"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Julin was married to Elin Constance née Blomberg. The couple had son Albert von Julin who died at young age during the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 1918 as a victim of [[Red Terror (Finland)|red terror]],&lt;ref name="Biografiakeskus: A. L. v. Julin"/&gt; and daughter Maggie.&lt;ref name="Zilliacus: s.63-81"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zilliacus |first=Benedict |year=1984 |chapter= »Appelassa» |title=Wilhelm Wahlforss |language=Finnish |others=Translated from Swedish by Riitta Valajärvi |location=Porvoo |publisher=Oy Wärtsilä Ab |pages=63–81 |isbn=951-99541-8-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julin is characterised as a warm and social person who had a large circle of friends. His social character led to increased alcohol intake which gave him nickname ''[[Punsch|Punschen]]''. By time Julin's drinking started to effect on his work as Fiskars manager.&lt;ref name="Zilliacus: s.63-81"/&gt;

'''Amadeo Barletta Barletta''' was born in Italy in 1894 and died in the Dominican Republic in 1975. He was a successful Italian entrepreneur who migrated to the Caribbean in the early years of the 20th century and made significant contributions to the modernization of transportation and the media in the Dominican Republic and Cuba. 
Barletta’s unusual business acumen and character allowed him to overcome major adversities. A hurricane destroyed his properties in the Dominican Republic in 1930. Trujillo confiscated them in 1935. Batista seized his businesses in 1941. Fidel Castro expropriated them in 1960.

==Biography==
Barletta was a successful Italian entrepreneur who migrated to the Caribbean in the early years of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826702,00.html Time-Our Man in Miami Nov. 6, 1960]&lt;/ref&gt; Curiously for an immigrant who transformed the urban landscape of Havana and other Latin American cities with the massive introduction of General Motors vehicles, the year of his birth coincided with the launching of [[Benz Velo]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Benz Velo]]&lt;/ref&gt; the first standardized car by Karl Benz.

He was born in the small village of [[San Nicola Arcella]]&lt;ref&gt;[[San Nicola Arcella]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the poor region of Calabria, where he attended elementary school and earned his first income writing letters and documents for the villagers who appreciated his exceptionally good calligraphy. At the early age of 17 he migrated from Italy to Puerto Rico via New York during the summer of 1912. His records are registered in the historical archives of Ellis Island, the only port of entry to America at that time, where he declared to be 18 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellisisland.org/default.asp "The Statue of Liberty -Ellis Island Foundation Inc", American Family Immigration History Center (visited: October 4, 2009)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Amadeo moved to the Dominican Republic in 1920 and founded Santo Domingo Motors.  
In Dominican Republic he engaged in the tobacco business, breaking Trujillo’s monopoly with a U.S.A. company.  In 1935  Trujillo charged Barletta with conspiring to assassinate him,  incarcerating him.  Barletta  was the Honorary Consul of Italy appointed by [[Benito Mussolini]]. Trujillo cancelled his consular credentials by a decree and confiscated his properties and his Tobacco Company.

S., Rafael Brache, and Trujillo set a bail and Barletta was released from  jail.

Barletta moved to Cuba in 1939 and became the first exclusive distributor of [[General Motors]], outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nissan.net.ve/ambarhistoria.htm |title=Nissan in Venezuela |access-date=2009-04-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090308093930/http://nissan.net.ve/ambarhistoria.htm |archive-date=2009-03-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942 Amadeo left Cuba and immigrated to [[Argentina]] looking for a neutral country during [[World War II]].

In 1945 he returned to Cuba and developed his empire together with his son Amadeo Jr., by expanding and diversifying into the newspaper and television  spheres.

From 1950-1959 his businesses grow and diversify.  He was the owner and editor of "El Mundo", one of the largest Cuban newspapers during the 1950s, and was also the exclusive representative for [[General Motors]] in Cuba, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,858737-1,00.html Time Wizard at Work Monday, Mar. 20, 1950]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, [[Fidel Castro]] expropriated all his businesses and he was forced into exile with his family.

In 1962 right after [[Rafael Trujillo]]'s assassination, he moves back to the Dominican Republic and he reorganize his old car business.  In 1964 he obtains distribution exclusivity for [[Nissan]].

He died in the Dominican Republic (October 27, 1975).

'''Amalgam Comics''' was a publishing imprint shared by [[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]], in which the two comic book publishers merged their characters into new ones (e.g., DC Comics' [[Batman]] and Marvel Comics' [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] became the Amalgam character [[Dark Claw]]). These characters first appeared in a series of twelve comic books which were published in 1996, between the third and fourth issues of the ''[[DC vs. Marvel]]'' [[miniseries]]. A second set of twelve comic books followed one year later.&lt;ref name=SupermanHomepage&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.supermanhomepage.com/comics/comics-index-lists/comics-dcmarvel.php |title=DC vs Marvel |author=DCO PattyJ |work=Superman Homepage |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Alternate Universes 2005'' designated the Amalgam Universe as [[Marvel Comics Multiverse|Earth-9602]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Marvunapp|http://www.marvunapp.com/list/amalgamd.htm|Earth-Amalgam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comicsando.wordpress.com/2008/06/20/amalgam-comics/ |title=Amalgam Comics |date=June 20, 2008 |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; DC Comics has not identified an Amalgam Universe in its Multiverse.

== Publication history ==
On two separate occasions – April 1996 and June 1997 – Marvel and DC co-published issues under the ''Amalgam Comics'' imprint. The issues were presented as if the imprint had existed for decades, with stories and editorial comments referring to a fictional history stretching back to the [[Golden Age of Comics]], including [[retcon]]s and [[Reboot (continuity)|reboots]]. For example, they referred to ''Secret Crisis of the Infinity Hour'' (an amalgamation of Marvel's ''[[Secret Wars]]'', DC's ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'', Marvel's ''[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]'', and DC's ''[[Zero Hour (comics)|Zero Hour]]''), which featured the well-known cover of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #7, but with [[Super-Soldier]] holding his sidekick's body, instead of Superman holding [[Supergirl]]. Several issues  included fake [[comic book letter column|letter-columns]] to provide the illusion of background to the stories, with the "fans'" hometowns formed by amalgamating the names of existing cities.&lt;ref name=Beaver /&gt;

The first Amalgam event occurred near the end of the [[Marvel vs. DC]] crossover event in 1996. In that event, the Marvel and DC universes were shown being combined into one, and the Amalgam comics were presented as the result of that. The first twelve Amalgam titles were released the following week, delaying both publishers' regular releases by one week. Half the comics in the event were published by Marvel and half by DC. A year later, the stunt was repeated, but without the crossover providing context.&lt;ref name=Beaver&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Radford |first1=Bill |year= |title=New Amalgam comics bring back characters, add a few |journal=Beaver County Times |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |date=April 20, 1997 |doi= |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IKNUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eDsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2912,4664384 |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, both publishers collected their issues into trade paperback collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marvel graphic novels and related publications: an annotated guide to comics, prose novels, children's books, articles, criticism and reference works, 1965–2005 |last=Weiner |first=Robert G.|year=2008 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=978-0-7864-2500-6 |pages=385 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=npIsZV7grboC&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;dq=%22Amalgam%20Comics%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Marvel/DC%20Crossovers%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=January 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the two rounds of Amalgam Comics, the two publishers released a second crossover, ''DC/Marvel: All Access''. A third mini-series, ''Unlimited Access'', followed the second round. Both crossovers featured additional Amalgam characters.

== Fictional origin of the Amalgam Universe ==
The two comic universes came together when the two physical incarnations of their respective universes (referred to as "the Brothers") became aware of each other after eons of slumber. To prevent the Brothers from destroying each other, characters from each universe battled to determine which universe would survive (a real world vote by readers of the series was conducted to determine the outcome of five of the in-comic matchups, with three of them favoring the Marvel hero). [[Access (comics)|Access]], a character created for the event and co-owned by Marvel and DC, served as a gate keeper who became stuck while traveling between the two universes.

When the fighting concluded, neither universe was willing to go. To prevent total destruction, the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] and the [[Living Tribunal]] created an [[Shared universe|amalgamated universe]], in which only Access and Dr. Strangefate knew the truth about the merge. The two characters fought against each other to reverse or preserve the change.

Access managed to separate the Brothers with the help of Amalgam's heroes; before the merge had taken place, he had planted 'shards' of the universe in [[Batman]] and [[Captain America]]. Once he discovered Dark Claw (the result of Batman's merger with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]) and Super-Soldier (the fusion between Captain America and [[Superman]]), he used those shards to give the Spectre and the Tribunal the power to restore the universes. Batman, Captain America, and Access were thus able to make the Brothers realize that their conflict was pointless, and the universes were separated once again.&lt;ref name=SupermanHomepage /&gt;

== Amalgam characters ==
{{Original research|section|date=August 2010}}
{{Main|List of Amalgam Comics characters}}
During the event, pairs of Marvel and DC characters were merged into single characters. The same was done with teams and fictional locations. Usually the merged characters had something in common (for example, the four-member [[Jack Kirby]] creations of the [[Fantastic Four]] and [[Challengers of the Unknown]], or water-themed heroes [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]] and [[Aquaman]]), or their names or themes allowed for clever combinations (such as Superman and Captain America's amalgamation, Super-Soldier, a reference to the [[Weapon Plus|Super Soldier serum]] that created Captain America; Bat-Thing, an amalgamation of [[Man-Bat]] and [[Man-Thing]]; or Shatterstarfire, the amalgamation of [[Shatterstar]] and [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]]).

'''André Dang Van Nha''' (born [[Voh]], New Caledonia, 27 July 1936) is a [[New Caledonia]]n mining magnate, of [[Vietnam]]ese origin and [[France|French]]/[[Australia]]n/Vietnamese citizenship. He is best known for brokering a series of remarkable mining deals that also supported the [[Kanak people|Kanak]] cause for independence from France.

==Background==
André Dang was born in poverty to Nguyen Thi Binh, a Vietnamese woman who had left behind her three children in Phhuc Am in French Indochina, and was recruited as an indentured labourer by a mining company in 1935 to work on [[New Caledonia]]'s nickel mines in and around the [[Koniambo mine|Koniambo]] complex, close to the town of [[Voh]] in the country's north. She was treated harshly like many of the [[:fr:Chân Dăng|Chân Dăng]] Vietnamese labourers imported to work the mines, and suffered greatly as one of few women. She met Dang Van Nha at the camp and André Dang was their child. Dang Van Nha died in an industrial accident in 1937 while constructing a wharf. Because they were not married, indeed married to others in Vietnam, Thi Binh received none of his pension, and was posted to even harsher labour on a chrome mine near Koumac where her son was cared for by other Vietnamese as she worked long days.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Pitoiset, A. and C. Wéry. 2008. ''Mystère Dang''. Noumea: Le Rayon Vert.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was unsustainable, and André Dang was then adopted by a Vietnamese couple of modest means and living in Nouméa. He gradually integrated into the predominant French culture of the city. At the age of 6, US Marines arrived in Nouméa after a major Pacific base was established by the Allies, and Dang was in frequent contact with them and learned English. He attended Sacré Cœur and then Frédéric Surleu public schools. In 1949 his mother finished her contract on the mines, moved to Nouméa,  and he returned to live with her along with two new siblings. Working as a mechanic, he married Bui Thi En at the age of 18 and gained a diploma and a job at the Doniambo nickel smelter. They had 4 children. He was supported to undertake a degree in engineering in Marseilles in the late 1950s, where he also took French citizenship.

==Business activities==
In 1961 Dang returned to Nouméa to co-manage first a Citroën dealership, and then met great success with his own Toyota import business and petrol station. He suffered racism in his business affairs, particularly in the 1960s, in a city populated largely by Europeans protecting their monopoly, and particularly hostile to Vietnamese, three quarters of whom left New Caledonia in that decade to return to Vietnam during its war. In the 1970s he met and became friends with [[Jean-Marie Tjibaou]], a Kanak leader and supporter of independence from France. Increasingly aligned with, but not a participant in, independence struggles in the 1980s, he was forced into exile in Australia after being falsely accused of financial support for the independence movement. His petrol station was torched during ''les Evénements'', while he was away on business in Sydney and he remained there living in Kellyville, NSW and setting up several new businesses, becoming an Australian citizen. After the signing of the [[Matignon Agreements (1988)|Accords de Matignon]] in 1988 he returned, and took on the Directorship of SMSP (Société minière du sud Pacifique), which had recently been sold by [[Jacques Lafleur]] to the Kanak-controlled SOFINOR operation as a gesture of political reconciliation.

He was successful in turning around this bankrupt company, and by 1995, the SMSP had become a prime nickel exporter. In 2008 they opened a nickel smelter in South Korea and a series of deals led by Dang enabled construction of another, the huge Koniambo massif project where he had begun his life. The brokering of this deal by Dang and others in the ‘Bercy Agreements’ of 1998 was legendary in New Caledonia, involving a swap of mining titles with other nickel mines, political interventions, and clever bargaining to provide the Kanak north of the island with its own economic powerhouse and employment opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandsbusiness.com/2014/6/cover-story/mr-nickel/ |title=Home |website=Islandsbusiness.com |date=2016-03-21 |accessdate=2016-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150625222022/http://www.islandsbusiness.com/2014/6/cover-story/mr-nickel/ |archivedate=2015-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The US$5.3 billion plant at Vavouto is operated by Koniambo Nickel SAS (KNS), a joint venture between the Northern Province’s SMSP and the transnational conglomerate Glencore-Xstrata.The [[Koniambo mine]] and smelter, a multibillion-dollar operation, entered production in 2014. Dang, now in his late 70s, is President and CEO of SMSP, and strongly protective of New Caledonian ownership in its mining interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smsp.nc/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=100%3Aandre-dang-van-nha&amp;catid=20&amp;lang=en |title=André Dang Van Nha |website=Smsp.nc |date=1979-09-27 |accessdate=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''capitalization-weighted (or "cap-weighted") index''', also called a '''market-value-weighted index''' is a [[stock market index]] whose components are [[stock market index#Weighting|weighted]] according to the total [[market value]] of their [[Shares outstanding|outstanding shares]].  Every day an individual stock's price changes and thereby changes a stock index's value. The impact that individual stock's price change has on the index is proportional to the company's overall market value (the share price multiplied by the number of outstanding shares), in a capitalization-weighted index. In other types of indices, different ratios are used.

For example, the [[American Stock Exchange|AMEX]] Composite Index (XAX) had more than 800 component stocks. The weighting of each stock constantly shifted with changes in the stock's price and the number of shares outstanding. The index fluctuates in line with the price move of the stocks.&lt;ref&gt;John Downes &amp; Jordan Elliot Goodman, ''Finance and Investment Terms'', Barrons Financial Guides, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Stock market indices are a type of [[Index (economics)|economic index]].

==Mathematical formula==

The formula underneath is a simple way of seeing the percent changes that your ETF (or any other shares of stock, for that matter) has gained (or lost). If an investor purchases 100 shares of AAPL at $1.00 and a month later the purchased AAPL is trading at $1.10, the investment yielded a 10% gain/return (($110/$100)-1=0.1, or 10%).

&lt;math&gt;\frac{ index_{\rm_{new}}}{ index_{\rm_{old}}} = \frac{ \sum {\# shares} \cdot price_{\rm_{new}}}{ \sum {\# shares} \cdot price_{\rm{old}}}&lt;/math&gt;

==Free-float weighting==

A common version of capitalization weighting is the ''free-float'' weighting. With this method a ''float factor'' is assigned to each stock to account for the proportion of outstanding shares that are held by the general public, as opposed to "closely held" shares owned by the government, royalty, or company insiders (see [[Public float|float]]). For example, if for some stock 15% of shares are closely held, and the other 85% are publicly held, the float factor will be 0.85, by which the company's market capitalization will be multiplied before weighting its value against the rest of the index. In other words, the number of shares used for calculation is the number of shares "floating", rather than outstanding.

An index that is weighted in this manner is said to be "float-adjusted" or "float-weighted", in addition to being cap-weighted. For example, the [[S&amp;P 500|S&amp;P 500 index]] is both cap-weighted and float-adjusted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikinvest: How stock indices work|Market Cap calculations via Wikinvest]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, in the United States, capitalization-weighted indices tended to use full weighting, i.e., all outstanding shares were included, while float-weighted indexing has been the norm in other countries, perhaps because of large cross-holdings or government ownership. More recently, many of the U.S. indices, such as the S&amp;P 500, have been changed to a [[Public float|float]]-adjusted weighting which makes their calculation more consistent with non-U.S. indices.

==Other types of indices==
An index may also be classified according to the method used to determine its price. In a [[price-weighted index]] such as the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]], the price of each component stock is the only consideration when determining the value of the index. Thus, price movement of even a single security will heavily influence the value of the index even though the dollar shift is less significant in a relatively high-value name.  In a [[Fundamentally based indexes|fundamentally weighted]] index, stocks are weighted by fundamental factors like sales or book value.

'''Chan Mah Phee''' ({{zh|t=曾廣庇|poj=Chan Kóng-pì}}; born in [[Fujian]], [[China]]) was a [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] [[Chinese people|Chinese]] businessman, land-owner, investor and philanthropist who founded numerous successful ventures in [[Rangoon]] (now Yangon), [[Burma]] in 1800s and 1900s.

==Early life ==
Chan was born in [[Amoy, Fujian]] in the nineteenth century to his peasant father Chan Ee Shin. In 1870, Chan migrated to Singapore before ultimately moving to Rangoon in 1872.

==Rangoon==

Chan Mah Phee founded his most successful business [[Taik Leong|Taik Leong Co.]] in Rangoon in 1883. The company dealt primarily in oil, rice and tobacco. Chan Mah Phee was also a director of [[The Chinese Steamship Co., Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Chinese Steamship Co., Limited (advertisement)|page=13|url=http://newspapers.nl.sg/Digitised/Article.aspx?articleid=straitstimes19110708.2.109.3 |newspaper=The Straits Times, Singapore |date=8 July 1911 |accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chan was the largest Chinese land owner and most important Chinese rice-dealer in Burma.&lt;ref name="Charney"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKkynGL9vB4C&amp;dq=978-0-521-61758-1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0OKLUJLCHZKK4gTVrICgCA&amp;redir_esc=y |title=A History of Modern Bruma |last=Charney |first=Michael |year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=22–23 |isbn=978-0-521-61758-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a Rangoon where communities remained voluntarily segregated down ethnic lines, he managed to be a prominent figure in Rangoon with many connections which extended far beyond the municipality's [[Chinese people in Burma|Chinese community]].

==Philanthropic work==

Chan Mah Phee and Daw Aye Mya built a Tazaung at the [[Shwedagon Pagoda]]. They also offered Satu-ditha at the Tabaung Festival. They also donated to build Hwa Kyone High School (later known as No 3 Regional College / Kyimyindine Campus, Rangoon University). They built Chan Mah Phee hospital in [[Ahlon Township|Ahlon]] where a street was named in his honor.

==Legacy==
The Chan Ma Phee hall of [[Shwedagon Pagoda]] was named in his honor in recognition of his patronage and financial contributions to the temple. Chan Mah Phee's second son, [[Chan Chor Khine]] inherited and expanded his father's businesses. [[Chan Chor Khine]] was educated at [[Basic Education High School No. 6 Botataung|St. Paul's High School, Rangoon]].

[[File:coaltub.png|right|frame|A succession of laws on child labour, the so-called [[Factory Acts]], were passed in the UK in the 19th century.

'''Child labour''' refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives children of their childhood, interferes with their ability to attend regular school, and that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is child labour?|publisher=International Labour Organization|year=2012|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/facts/lang--en/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is considered exploitative by many [[international organisations]].

Child labour has existed to varying extents, through most of history. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, many children aged 5–14 from poorer families still worked in Europe, the United States and various colonies of European powers. These children mainly worked in agriculture, home-based assembly operations, factories, mining and in services such as [[Newsboys Strike of 1899#Background|news boys]]. Some worked night shifts lasting 12 hours. With the rise of household income, availability of schools and passage of child labour laws, the incidence rates of child labour fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Labour in Historical Perspective: 1800-1985|publisher=UNICEF|author=Cunningham and Viazzo|isbn=88-85401-27-9|url=http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/hisper_childlabour_low.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ep99/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The World of Child Labour|author=Hugh Hindman|publisher=M.E.

In the world’s poorest countries, around 1 in 4 children are engaged in child labour, the highest number of whom (29 percent) live in [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name="UNICEF Data – Child Labour"&gt;{{cite web|title=UNICEF Data – Child Labour |publisher=UNICEF |year=2017 |url=https://data.unicef.org/topic/child-protection/child-labour/ |accessdate=18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, four African nations (Mali, Benin, Chad and Guinea-Bissau) witnessed over 50 percent of children aged 5–14 working.&lt;ref name="UNICEF Data – Child Labour"/&gt;  Worldwide agriculture is the largest employer of child labour.&lt;ref name="Child Labour"&gt;{{cite news|title=Child Labour|publisher=The Economist|date=20 December 2005|url=http://www.economist.com/node/5328365?zid=317&amp;ah=8a47fc455a44945580198768fad0fa41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of child labour is found in rural settings and informal urban economy; children are predominantly employed by their parents, rather than factories.&lt;ref name=ep05/&gt; Poverty and lack of schools are considered as the primary cause of child labour.&lt;ref name=ilo2008a/&gt;

Globally the incidence of child labour decreased from 25% to 10% between 1960 and 2003, according to the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;Norberg, Johan (2007), ''[http://www.regeringen.se/contentassets/94943fabd8c9427492a71d6324e2d23a/varldens-valfard-fyra-decennier-som-forandrade-planeten Världens välfärd]'' (Stockholm: Government Offices of Sweden), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the total number of child labourers remains high, with [[UNICEF]] and [[ILO]] acknowledging an estimated 168 million children aged 5–17 worldwide, were involved in child labour in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To eliminate child labour, "attack it at its roots" UNICEF says|publisher=UNICEF|year=2013|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_70610.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Mill Children in Macon 2.jpg|thumb|Child labourers, [[Macon, Georgia]], 1909]]

===Child labour in preindustrial societies===
Child labour forms an intrinsic part of pre-industrial economies.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Diamond, J., The World Before Yesterday&lt;/ref&gt; In pre-industrial societies, there is rarely a concept of childhood in the modern sense. Children often begin to actively participate in activities such as child rearing, hunting and farming as soon as they are competent. In many societies, children as young as 13 are seen as adults and engage in the same activities as adults.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The work of children was important in pre-industrial societies, as children needed to provide their labour for their survival and that of their group. Pre-industrial societies were characterised by low productivity and short life expectancy, preventing children from participating in productive work would be more harmful to their welfare and that of their group in the long run. In pre-industrial societies, there was little need for children to attend school. This is especially the case in non literate societies. Most pre-industrial skill and knowledge were amenable to being passed down through direct mentoring or apprenticing by competent adults.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===The Industrial Revolution===

With the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Britain in the late 18th century, there was a rapid increase in the industrial exploitation of labour, including child labour. Industrial cities such as Birmingham, Manchester and Liverpool rapidly grew from small villages into large cities and improving [[child mortality]] rates. These cities drew in the population that was rapidly growing due to increased agricultural output.  This process was replicated in other industrialising counties.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The [[Victorian era]] in particular became notorious for the conditions under which children were employed.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Del Col, West Virginia University, [http://www.victorianweb.org/history/workers1.html The Life of the Industrial Worker in Nineteenth-Century England]&lt;/ref&gt; Children as young as four were employed in production factories and mines working long hours in dangerous, often fatal, working conditions.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;E. P. Thompson ''The Making of the English Working Class'', (Penguin, 1968), pp. 366–7&lt;/ref&gt; In [[coal mine]]s, children would crawl through tunnels too narrow and low for adults.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Humphries, ''Childhood And Child Labour in the British Industrial Revolution'' (2010) p 33&lt;/ref&gt; Children also worked as errand boys, [[crossing sweeper]]s, shoe blacks, or selling matches, flowers and other cheap goods.&lt;ref name="dan" /&gt; Some children undertook work as [[apprentice]]s to respectable trades, such as building or as [[domestic servant]]s (there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid-18th century). Working hours were long: builders worked 64 hours a week in summer and 52 in winter, while domestic servants worked 80-hour weeks.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Child labour played an important role in the Industrial Revolution from its outset, often brought about by economic hardship. The children of the poor were expected to contribute to their family income.&lt;ref name="dan"&gt;Barbara Daniels, [http://www.hiddenlives.org.uk/articles/poverty.html Poverty and Families in the Victorian Era]&lt;/ref&gt; In 19th-century Great Britain, one-third of poor families were without a [[breadwinner]], as a result of death or abandonment, obliging many children to work from a young age. In England and Scotland in 1788, two-thirds of the workers in 143 water-powered [[cotton mill]]s were described as children.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.galbithink.org/child.htm Child Labour and the Division of Labour in the Early English Cotton Mills]".&lt;/ref&gt; A high number of children also worked as [[prostitute]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/hist8.html |title=Child Labour by Professor David Cody, Hartwick College |publisher=The Victorian Web|accessdate=2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author [[Charles Dickens]] worked at the age of 12 in a [[Blacking (polish)|blacking]] factory, with his family in [[debtor's prison]].&lt;ref name=Foster23&gt;{{harvnb|Forster|2006|pp=23–24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Child wages were often low; as little as 10–20% of an adult male's wage.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A. Galbi. Centre for History and Economics, King's College, Cambridge CB2 1ST.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] was an outspoken opponent of child labour,&lt;ref&gt;In ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Part II:Proletariats and Communist and ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', Part III&lt;/ref&gt; saying British industries, "could but live by sucking blood, and children’s blood too," and that U.S. capital was financed by the "capitalized blood of children".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricardo.ecn.wfu.edu/~cottrell/OPE/archive/0604/att-0138/01-PoliticalEconOfTheDead.pdf|author=Mark Neocleous|title=THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF THE DEAD: MARX’S VAMPIRES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|author=Karl Marx|title=Inaugural Address of the International Working Men’s Association|year=1864}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] castigated child labour in her 1835 poem ''The Factory'', portions of which she pointedly included in her 18th Birthday Tribute to Princess Victoria in 1837.

Throughout the second half of the 19th century, child labour began to decline in industrialised societies due to regulation and economic factors because of the Growth of [[Trade Unions]] . The regulation of child labour began from the earliest days of the Industrial revolution. The first act to regulate child labour in Britain was passed in 1803. As early as 1802 and 1819 [[Factory Acts]] were passed to regulate the working hours of [[workhouse]] children in factories and cotton mills to 12 hours per day. These acts were largely ineffective and after radical agitation, by for example the "Short Time Committees" in 1831, a Royal Commission recommended in 1833 that children aged 11–18 should work a maximum of 12 hours per day, children aged 9–11 a maximum of eight hours, and children under the age of nine were no longer permitted to work. This act however only applied to the textile industry, and further agitation led to another act in [[Factories Act 1847|1847]] limiting both adults and children to 10-hour working days. [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 7th Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] was an outspoken advocate of regulating child labour.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

As technology improved and proliferated, there was a greater need for educated employees. This saw an increase in schooling, with the eventual introduction of [[compulsory schooling]]. Improved technology and automation also made child labour redundant.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Early 20th century===

In the early 20th century, thousands of boys were employed in glass making industries. [[Glass production|Glass making]] was a dangerous and tough job especially without the current technologies. The process of making glass includes intense heat to melt glass (3133&amp;nbsp;°F). When the boys are at work, they are exposed to this heat. This could cause eye trouble, lung ailments, heat exhaustion, cut, and burns. Since workers were paid by the piece, they had to work productively for hours without a break. Since furnaces had to be constantly burning, there were night shifts from 5:00&amp;nbsp;pm to 3:00&amp;nbsp;am. Many factory owners preferred boys under 16 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hine|first=Russell Freedman ; with photographs by Lewis|title=Kids at work : Lewis Hine and the crusade against child labour|year=1994|publisher=Clarion Books|location=New York|isbn=0395587034|pages=54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 1.7 million children under the age of fifteen were employed in American industry by 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://webinstituteforteachers.org/%7Ebobfinn/2003/industrialrevolution.htm |title=The Industrial Revolution |publisher=Web Institute for Teachers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804084618/http://webinstituteforteachers.org/~bobfinn/2003/industrialrevolution.htm |archivedate=4 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1910, over 2 million children in the same age group were employed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/hine-photos/ Photographs of Lewis Hine: Documentation of Child Labour]". The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;  This included children who rolled cigarettes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://userpages.umbc.edu/~arubin/HIST402_SP2007/87C1FBEB4AC722BB805B2CABD2BC32D4.html|title=Virginia:  Cigarette Rollers|website=userpages.umbc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; engaged in factory work, worked as bobbin [[doffer]]s in textile mills, worked in coal mines and were employed in canneries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://userpages.umbc.edu/~arubin/HIST402_SP2007/9B72B3F098F81A13DAA017F591A2D33E.html Child Labour in the South: Essays and Links to photographs from the Lewis Hine Collection at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lewis Hine]]'s photographs of child labourers in the 1910s powerfully evoked the plight of working children in the American south.  Hine took these photographs between 1908 and 1917 as the staff photographer for the [[National Child Labor Committee]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

====Household enterprises====
Factories and mines were not the only places where child labour was prevalent in the early 20th century. Home-based manufacturing across the United States and Europe employed children as well.&lt;ref name=ep99&gt;{{cite book|title=The Global Construction of Gender - Home based work in Political Economy of 20th Century|author=Elisabeth Prügl|pages=25–31, 50–59|isbn=978-0231115612|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Governments and reformers argued that labour in factories must be regulated and the state had an obligation to provide welfare for poor. Legislation that followed had the effect of moving work out of factories into urban homes. Families and women, in particular, preferred it because it allowed them to generate income while taking care of household duties.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Home-based manufacturing operations were active year-round. Families willingly deployed their children in these income generating home enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kids at Work: Lewis Hine and the Crusade Against Child Labour|author=Russell Freedman|publisher=Sandpiper|year=1998|isbn=978-0395797266}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, men worked from home. In France, over 58 percent of garment workers operated out of their homes; in Germany, the number of full-time home operations nearly doubled between 1882 and 1907; and in the United States, millions of families operated out of home seven days a week, year round to produce garments, shoes, artificial flowers, feathers, match boxes, toys, umbrellas and other products. Children aged 5–14 worked alongside the parents. Home-based operations and child labour in Australia, Britain, Austria and other parts of the world was common. Rural areas similarly saw families deploying their children in agriculture. In 1946, [[Frieda S. Miller]] - then Director of the [[United States Department of Labor]] - told the International Labour Organization that these home-based operations offered, "low wages, long hours, child labour, unhealthy and insanitary working conditions."&lt;ref name=ep99/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Miller, Frieda S.

Child labour is still common in many parts of the world. Estimates for child labour vary. It ranges between 250 and 304 million, if children aged 5–17 involved in any economic activity are counted. If light occasional work is excluded, ILO estimates there were 153 million child labourers aged 5–14 worldwide in 2008. This is about 20 million less than ILO estimate for child labourers in 2004. Some 60 percent of the child labour was involved in agricultural activities such as farming, dairy, fisheries and forestry. Another 25 percent of child labourers were in service activities such as retail, hawking goods, restaurants, load and transfer of goods, storage, picking and recycling trash, polishing shoes, domestic help, and other services. The remaining 15 percent laboured in assembly and manufacturing in informal economy, home-based enterprises, factories, mines, packaging salt, operating machinery, and such operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Child labour in Kyrgyz coal mines |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6955202.stm |accessdate=2007-08-25 | date=24 August 2007 |first=Natalia |last=Antelava}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Global child labour developments: Measuring trends from 2004 to 2008|author1=Yacouba Diallo |author2=Frank Hagemann |author3=Alex Etienne |author4=Yonca Gurbuzer |author5=Farhad Mehran |publisher=ILO|year=2010|isbn=978-92-2-123522-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{cite web |title=The State of the World's Children 1997  |work=UNICEF |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc97/report/ |accessdate=2007-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two out of three child workers work alongside their parents, in unpaid family work situations. Some children work as guides for tourists, sometimes combined with bringing in business for shops and restaurants. Child labour predominantly occurs in the rural areas (70%) and informal urban sector (26%).

Contrary to popular beliefs, most child labourers are employed by their parents rather than in manufacturing or formal economy. Children who work for pay or in-kind compensation are usually found in rural settings, then urban centres. Less than 3 percent of child labour aged 5–14 across the world work outside their household, or away from their parents.&lt;ref name="ep05" /&gt;

Child labour accounts for 22% of the workforce in Asia, 32% in Africa, 17% in Latin America, 1% in the US, Canada, Europe and other wealthy nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/237384/toolkitfr/pdf/facts.pdf|title=Server Error|website=info.worldbank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of child labourers varies greatly among countries and even regions inside those countries. Africa has the highest percentage of children aged 5–17 employed as child labour, and a total of over 65 million. Asia, with its larger population, has the largest number of children employed as child labour at about 114 million. Latin America and Caribbean region have lower overall population density, but at 14 million child labourers has high incidence rates too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tackling child labour: From commitment to action|publisher=[[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]] - ILO|year=2012|isbn=978-92-2-126374-6|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Informationresources/WCMS_181875/lang--en/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accurate present day child labour information is difficult to obtain because of disagreements between data sources as to what constitutes child labour. In some countries, government policy contributes to this difficulty. For example, the overall extent of child labour in China is unclear due to the government categorizing child labour data as “highly secret”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Children's Rights: China|publisher=Law Library of Congress, United States|year=2012|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/child-rights/china.php#Child%20Labour%20and%20Exploitation}}&lt;/ref&gt; China has enacted regulations to prevent child labour; still, the practice of child labour is reported to be a persistent problem within China, generally in agriculture and low-skill service sectors as well as small workshops and manufacturing enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The dark side of labour in China|author=Karine Lepillez|year=2009|url=http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/slavery/china.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China: End Child Labour in State Schools |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=4 December 2007 |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2007/12/02/china-end-child-labour-state-schools |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111234752/http://www.hrw.org/news/2007/12/02/china-end-child-labour-state-schools |archivedate=11 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Causes of child labour==

===Primary causes===
International Labour Organization (ILO) suggests poverty is the greatest single cause behind child labour.&lt;ref name="ilo2008a"&gt;{{cite web|title=Child labour - causes|year=2008|publisher=ILO, United Nations|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/region/eurpro/moscow/areas/ipec/causes.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; For impoverished households, income from a child's work is usually crucial for his or her own survival or for that of the household. Income from working children, even if small, may be between 25 and 40% of the household income. Other scholars such as Harsch on African child labour, and Edmonds and Pavcnik on global child labour have reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref name="ep05"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child Labour in the Global Economy|author1=Eric V. Edmonds |author2=Nina Pavcnik |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=19|number=1|date=Winter 2005|pages=199–220|url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~hiscox/EdmondsPavcnik.pdf|doi=10.1257/0895330053147895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ernest Harsch|journal=Africa Recovery|title=Child labour rooted in Africa's poverty|volume=15|number=3|date=October 2001|pages=14–15|url=https://www.un.org/en/africarenewal/vol15no3/153chil4.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basu, Kaushik and Van, Phan Hoang, 1998. 'The Economics of Child Labour', [http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/contents/ ''American Economic Review''], 88(3),412–427&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of meaningful alternatives, such as affordable schools and quality education, according to ILO,&lt;ref name="ilo2008a" /&gt; is another major factor driving children to harmful labour. Children work because they have nothing better to do. Many communities, particularly rural areas where between 60–70% of child labour is prevalent, do not possess adequate school facilities. Even when schools are sometimes available, they are too far away, difficult to reach, unaffordable or the quality of education is so poor that parents wonder if going to school is really worth it.&lt;ref name="ep05" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Relationship between Education and Child Work|author=Jo Boyden|publisher=UNICEF|year=1994|url=http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/pdf/crs9.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural causes===
In European history when child labour was common, as well as in contemporary child labour of modern world, certain cultural beliefs have rationalised child labour and thereby encouraged it. Some view that work is good for the character-building and skill development of children. In many cultures, particular where the informal economy and small household businesses thrive, the cultural tradition is that children follow in their parents' footsteps; child labour then is a means to learn and practice that trade from a very early age. Similarly, in many cultures the education of girls is less valued or girls are simply not expected to need formal schooling, and these girls pushed into child labour such as providing domestic services.&lt;ref name="ilo2008a" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHILD LABOUR: ISSUES, CAUSES AND INTERVENTIONS |author1=Faraaz Siddiqi |author2=Harry Anthony Patrinos |publisher=The World Bank |year=1999 |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1099079877269/547664-1099079934475/547667-1135281552767/Child_Labour_issues.pdf }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child Labour in Latin America: Poverty as Cause and Effect |author=Michaelle Tauson |year=2009 |url=http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/latinamerica2/digest-human%20rights%20in%20latin%20america%20vol%202-childlabour.pdf }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child Labour and Cultural Relativism: From 19th Century America to 21st Century Nepal|author=Michele D'Avolio|journal=Pace International Law Review|date=Spring 2004|volume=16|issue=1|url=http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/pilr/vol16/iss1/5/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macroeconomic causes===
Biggeri and Mehrotra have studied the macroeconomic factors that encourage child labour. They focus their study on five Asian nations including India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand and Philippines. They suggest&lt;ref name="mbsm"&gt;{{cite book|title=Asian Informal Workers: Global Risks, Local Protection|author1=Mario Biggeri |author2=Santosh Mehrotra |publisher=Routledge|year=2007|isbn=978-0-415-38275-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that child labour is a serious problem in all five, but it is not a new problem. Macroeconomic causes encouraged widespread child labour across the world, over most of human history. They suggest that the causes for child labour include both the demand and the supply side. While poverty and unavailability of good schools explain the child labour supply side, they suggest that the growth of low-paying informal economy rather than higher paying formal economy is amongst the causes of the demand side. Other scholars too suggest that inflexible labour market, sise of informal economy, inability of industries to scale up and lack of modern manufacturing technologies are major macroeconomic factors affecting demand and acceptability of child labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Policy Analysis of Child Labour: A Comparative Study|author1=Christiaan Grootaert |author2=Harry Anthony Patrinos |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1999|isbn=978-0312221225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child Labour and the Division of Labour in the Early English Cotton Mills|author=Douglas Galbi|journal=Journal of Population Economics|year=1997|volume=10|issue=4|pages= 357–375|url=http://www.galbithink.org/child.pdf|doi=10.1007/s001480050048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, D.

===Colonial empires===
Systematic use of child labour was common place in the colonies of European powers between 1650 and 1950. In Africa, colonial administrators encouraged traditional kin-ordered modes of production, that is hiring a household for work not just the adults. Millions of children worked in colonial agricultural plantations, mines and domestic service industries.&lt;ref name="bass04"&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Labour in Sub-Saharan Africa|author=Loretta Bass|year=2004|isbn=978-1588262868|pages=30–43|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The World of Child Labour|author=Beverly Grier (Ed: Hugh Hindman)|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2009|pages=173–177|isbn=978-0-7656-1707-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophisticated schemes were promulgated where children in these colonies between the ages of 5–14 were hired as an apprentice without pay in exchange for learning a craft. A system of Pauper Apprenticeship came into practice in the 19th century where the colonial master neither needed the native parents' nor child's approval to assign a child to labour, away from parents, at a distant farm owned by a different colonial master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Masters, Servants, and Magistrates in Britain and the Empire, 1562-1955 (Studies in Legal History)|author=Douglas Hay|year=2007|isbn=978-0807828779|pages=38–46|publisher= University of North Carolina Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other schemes included 'earn-and-learn' programs where children would work and thereby learn. Britain for example passed a law, the so-called Masters and Servants Act of 1899, followed by Tax and Pass Law, to encourage child labour in colonies particularly in Africa. These laws offered the native people the legal ownership to some of the native land in exchange for making labour of wife and children available to colonial government's needs such as in farms and as ''picannins''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Beyond laws, new taxes were imposed on colonies. One of these taxes was the [[tax per head|Head Tax]] in the [[British Empire|British]] and [[French colonial empire|French]] colonial empires. The tax was imposed on everyone older than 8 years, in some colonies. To pay these taxes and cover living expenses, children in colonial households had to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Child labour in the Gold Coast: the economics of work, education and the family in late-colonial Africa, c.1940-57|author=Jack Lord|journal=The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth|volume=4|issue=1|year=2011|pages=88–115|url=|doi=10.1353/hcy.2011.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Invisible Hands: Child Labour and the State in Colonial Zimbabwe by Beverly Grier (a review)|author=Karen Wells|journal=The Journal of the History of Childhood and Youth|volume=1|number=3|date=Fall 2008|pages=481–483 |doi= 10.1353/hcy.0.0025}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Head Tax, Social Structure and Rural Incomes in Cameroun, 1922-1937|author=Jane Guyer|journal=Cahiers d'Études Africaines|volume=20|issue=79|year=1980|pages=305–329|doi=10.3406/cea.1980.2338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In southeast Asian colonies, such as Hong Kong, child labour such as the ''[[Mui Tsai]]'' (妹仔), was rationalised as a cultural tradition and ignored by British authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Child slavery in Hong Kong: the mui tsai system|year=1930|author=Hugh Lyttleton Haslewood|publisher=Sheldon Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Theorizing the Chinese: The MUI TSAI controversy and construction of transnational chineseness in Hong Kong and British Malaya|author=Karen Yuen|journal=New Zealand Journal of Asian Studies|volume= 6|number= 2| date= December 2004|pages= 95–110|url= http://www.nzasia.org.nz/downloads/NZJAS-Dec04/6_2_6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dutch East India Company]] officials rationalised their child labour abuses with, "it is a way to save these children from a worse fate." Christian mission schools in regions stretching from Zambia to Nigeria too required work from children, and in exchange provided religious education, not [[secular education]].&lt;ref name="bass04" /&gt; Elsewhere, the Canadian Dominion Statutes in form of so-called Breaches of Contract Act, stipulated jail terms for uncooperative child workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Masters, Servants, and Magistrates in Britain and the Empire, 1562-1955 (Studies in Legal History)|author=Douglas Hay|year=2007|isbn=978-0807828779|pages=203–207|publisher= University of North Carolina Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What industries children work in depends on if they grew up in a [[rural area]] or an [[urban area]]. Children who were born in urban areas often found themselves working for street vendors, washing cars, helping in construction sites, weaving clothing, and sometimes even working as exotic dancers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; While children who grew up in rural areas would work on farms doing physical labour, working with animals, and selling crops.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Of all the child workers, the most serious cases involved street children and trafficked children due to the physical and emotional abuse they endured by their employers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; To address the issue of child labour, the United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child Act was implemented in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Children and Youth in the Labour Process in Africa|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/ZTAwMHhuYV9fNDEwNzQ0X19BTg2?sid=d5b9e01a-6728-4482-bff3-881ed3b68abf@sessionmgr110&amp;vid=4&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|page = 12}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet due to poverty, lack of education and ignorance, the legal actions were not/are not wholly enforced or accepted in Africa.&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

Other legal factors that have been implemented to end and reduce child labour includes the global response that came into force in 1979 by the declaration of the International Year of the Child.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|title = Children and Youth in the Labour Process in Africa|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/ZTAwMHhuYV9fNDEwNzQ0X19BTg2?sid=d5b9e01a-6728-4482-bff3-881ed3b68abf@sessionmgr110&amp;vid=4&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|page = 17}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations, these two declarations worked on many levels to eliminate child labour.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Although many actions have been taken to end this epidemic, child labour in Africa is still an issue today due to the unclear definition of adolescence and how much time is needed for children to engage in activities that are crucial for their development.  Another issue that often comes into play is the link between what constitutes as child labour within the household due to the cultural acceptance of children helping run the family business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Children and Youth in the Labour Process in Africa|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/ZTAwMHhuYV9fNDEwNzQ0X19BTg2?sid=d5b9e01a-6728-4482-bff3-881ed3b68abf@sessionmgr110&amp;vid=4&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|page = 18}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the end, there is a consistent challenge for the national government to strengthen its grip politically on child labour, and to increase education and awareness on the issue of children working below the legal age limit. With children playing an important role in the African economy, child labour still plays an important role for many in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=d5b9e01a-6728-4482-bff3-881ed3b68abf%2540sessionmgr110&amp;vid=6&amp;hid=121|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-30|page = 765}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Australia ===
From European settlement in 1788, child convicts were occasionally sent to Australia where they were made to work. Child labour was not as excessive in Australia as in Britain. With a low population, agricultural productivity was higher and families did not face starvation as in established industrialised countries. Australia also did not have significant industry until the later part of the 20th century when child labour laws, and compulsory schooling had developed under the influence of Britain. From the 1870s Child labour was restricted by compulsory schooling.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Child labour laws in Australia differ from state to state. Generally, children are allowed to work at any age, but restrictions exist for children under 15 years of age. These restrictions apply to work hours and the type of work that children can perform. In all states, children are obliged to attend school until a minimum leaving age, 15 years of age in all states except Tasmania and Queensland where the [[School-leaving age|leaving age]] is 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fairwork.gov.au/find-help-for/young-workers-and-students/what-age-can-i-start-work|title=Welcome to the Fair Work Ombudsman website|website=Fair Work Ombudsman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CriancaLixao20080220MarcelloCasalJrAgenciaBrasil.jpg|thumb|Child labour in [[Brazil]], leaving after collecting recyclables from a landfill.]]

Child labour has been a consistent struggle for children in [[Brazil]] ever since the country was colonised on April 22, 1500 by [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Work that many children took part in was not always visible, legal, or paid. Free or slave labour was a common occurrence for many youths and was a part of their everyday lives as they grew into adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92@sessionmgr112&amp;vid=3&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=13|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27|page = 417}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet due to there being no clear definition of how to classify what a child or youth is, there has been little historical documentation of child labour during the colonial period. Due to this lack of documentation, it is hard to determine just how many children were used for what kinds of work before the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92@sessionmgr112&amp;vid=3&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=13|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27|page = 419}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first documentation of child labour in Brazil occurred during the time of indigenous societies and slave labour where it was found that children were forcibly working on tasks that exceeded their emotional and physical limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92@sessionmgr112&amp;vid=3&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=13|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27|page = 418}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Armando Dias, for example, died in November 1913 whilst still very young, a victim of an electric shock when entering the textile industry where he worked. Boys and girls were victims of industrial accidents on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92@sessionmgr112&amp;vid=3&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=13|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27|page = 424}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, the minimum working age has been identified as fourteen due to continuous constitutional amendments that occurred in 1934, 1937, and 1946.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92@sessionmgr112&amp;vid=3&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=13|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-27|page = 428}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet due to a change in the [[dictatorship]] by the military in the 80’s, the minimum age restriction was reduced to the age of twelve but was reviewed due to reports of dangerous and hazardous working conditions in 1988. This led to the minimum age being raised once again to 14. Another set of restrictions was passed in 1998 that restricted the kinds of work youth could partake in, such as work that was considered hazardous like running construction equipment, or certain kinds of factory work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although many steps were taken to reduce the risk and occurrence of child labour, there is still a high number of children and adolescents working under the age of fourteen in Brazil. It was not until recently in the 80’s that it was discovered that almost nine million children in Brazil were working illegally and not partaking in traditional childhood activities that help to develop important life experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92@sessionmgr112&amp;vid=3&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=13|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 429}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian census data (PNAD, 1999) indicate that 2.55 million 10-14 year-olds were illegally holding jobs. They were joined by 3.7 million 15-17 year-olds and about 375,000 5-9 year-olds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92%2540sessionmgr112&amp;vid=16&amp;hid=126|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|publication-date = |location = |page = 5}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the raised age restriction of 14, at least half of the recorded young workers had been employed illegally which lead to many not being protect by important labour laws.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although substantial time has passed since the time of regulated child labour, there is still a large number of children working illegally in Brazil. Many children are used by drug cartels to sell and carry drugs, guns, and other illegal substances because of their perception of innocence. This type of work that youth are taking part in is very dangerous due to the physical and psychological implications that come with these jobs. Yet despite the hazards that come with working with drug dealers, there has been an increase in this area of employment throughout the country.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6c04b00e-b468-4b35-b869-d89c497dfc92@sessionmgr112&amp;vid=3&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=13|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 421}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Britain ===
Many factors played a role in Britain’s long-term economic growth, such as the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial revolution]] in the late 1700s and the prominent presence of child labour during the industrial age.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6d624cc3-343d-47a9-a7c2-ad06cfe61d98@sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=9&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=9|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29|page = 121}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children who worked at an early age were often not forced; but did so because they needed to help their family survive financially. Due to poor employment opportunities for many parents, sending their children to work on farms and in factories was a way to help feed and support the family.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Child Labour first started to occur in [[England]] when household businesses were turned into local labour markets that mass-produced the once homemade goods. Because children often helped produce the goods out of their homes, working in a factory to make those same goods was a simple change for many of these youths.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Although there are many counts of children under the age of ten working for factories, the majority of children workers were between the ages of ten and fourteen. This age range was an important time for many youths as they were first helping to provide for their families; while also transitioning to save for their own future families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour's Global Past, 1650-2000|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzQ4NTU4N19fQU41?sid=6d624cc3-343d-47a9-a7c2-ad06cfe61d98@sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=9&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=9|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29|page = 124}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the obligation, many children had to help support their families financially; another factor that influenced child labour was the demographic changes that occurred in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Workers in England, 1780-1820 : Parish Apprentices and the Making of the Early Industrial Labour Force|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzI2OTI5MF9fQU41?sid=6d624cc3-343d-47a9-a7c2-ad06cfe61d98@sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=8&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=3|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29|page = 3}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the eighteenth century, 20 percent of the population was made up of children between the ages of 5 and 14. Due to this substantial shift in available workers, and the development of the industrial revolution, children began to work earlier in life in companies outside of the home.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|title = Childhood and Child Labour in Industrial England : Diversity and Agency, 1750-1914|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzYzMzE4M19fQU41?sid=6d624cc3-343d-47a9-a7c2-ad06cfe61d98@sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=7&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29|page = 157}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, even though there was an increase of child labour in factories such as cotton textiles, there consistently was large numbers of children working in the field of [[agriculture]] and domestic production.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

With such a high percentage of children working, the rising of illiteracy, and the lack of a formal education became a widespread issue for many children who worked to provide for their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Childhood and Child Labour in Industrial England : Diversity and Agency, 1750-1914|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzYzMzE4M19fQU41?sid=6d624cc3-343d-47a9-a7c2-ad06cfe61d98@sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=7&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29|page = 163}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to this problematic trend, many parents developed a change of opinion when deciding whether or not to send their children to work. Other factors that lead to the decline of child labour included financial changes in the economy, changes in the development of technology, raised wages, and continuous regulations on factory legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Childhood and Child Labour in Industrial England : Diversity and Agency, 1750-1914|url = http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/bmxlYmtfXzYzMzE4M19fQU41?sid=6d624cc3-343d-47a9-a7c2-ad06cfe61d98@sessionmgr4003&amp;vid=7&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=1|website = eds.a.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29|page = 169}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first legal steps taken to end the occurrence of child labour was enacted more than fifty years ago. In 1966, the nation adopted the UN General Assembly of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|title = Child Labour in a Globalized World : A Legal Analysis of ILO Action|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/ebookviewer/ebook/ZTAwMHhuYV9fMjcwODc1X19BTg2?sid=02a823b0-8932-4058-b07b-b4ba13e729f8@sessionmgr111&amp;vid=6&amp;format=EB&amp;rid=7|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-29|page = 203}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This act legally limited the minimum age for when children could start work at the age of 14. But 23 years later in 1989 the Convention on the Rights of Children was adopted and helped to reduce the exploitation of children and demanded safe working environments. They all worked towards the goal of ending the most problematic forms of child labour.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Ecuador ===
An Ecuadorean study published in 2006 found child labour to be one of the main environmental problems affecting children's health. It reported that over 800,000 children are working in Ecuador, where they are exposed to heavy metals and toxic chemicals and are subject to mental and physical stress and the insecurity caused by being at risk of work-related accidents. Minors performing agricultural work along with their parents help apply pesticides without wearing protective equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Harari,R., Harari,H., (2006), Children’s Environment and Health in Latin America: The Ecuadorian Case, Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1076, 660-677.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the country of [[India]] is home to the largest number of children who are working illegally in various industrial industries. Agriculture in India is the largest sector where many children work at early ages to help support their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a9324979-b0a1-470b-a8a4-762ae940ce27%2540sessionmgr198&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=113|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 428}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these children are forced to work at young ages due to many family factors such as unemployment, a large number of family members, poverty, and lack of parental education. This is often the major cause of the high rate of child labour in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a9324979-b0a1-470b-a8a4-762ae940ce27%2540sessionmgr198&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=113|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 424}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 1757, the English East India Company defeated [[Siraj-ud-Daula]], the [[Nawab]] of Bengal, in the [[Battle of Plassey]]. The British thus became masters of east India (Bengal, Bihar, Orissa) – a prosperous region with a flourishing agriculture, industry and trade.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This led to a large number of children being forced into labour due to the increasing need of cheap labour to produce large numbers of goods. Many multinationals often employed children because that they can be recruited for less pay, and have more endurance to utilise in factory environments.&lt;ref name="eds.b.ebscohost.com"&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a9324979-b0a1-470b-a8a4-762ae940ce27%2540sessionmgr198&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=113|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 425}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason many Indian children were hired was because they lack knowledge of their basic rights, they did not cause trouble or complain, and they were often more trustworthy. The innocence that comes with childhood was utilised to make a profit by many and was encouraged by the need for family income.&lt;ref name="eds.b.ebscohost.com" /&gt;

A variety of Indian social scientists as well as the [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs) have done extensive research on the numeric figures of child labour found in India and determined that India contributes to one-third of Asia’s child labour and one-fourth of the world's child labour.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a9324979-b0a1-470b-a8a4-762ae940ce27%2540sessionmgr198&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=113|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 421}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a large number of children being illegally employed, the Indian government began to take extensive actions to reduce the number of children working, and to focus on the importance of facilitating the proper growth and development of children.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; International influences help to encourage legal actions to be taken in India, such as the Geneva Declaration of the Right of Children Act was passed in 1924. This act was followed by [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|The Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948 to which incorporated the basic human rights and needs of children for proper progression and growth in their younger years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a9324979-b0a1-470b-a8a4-762ae940ce27%2540sessionmgr198&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=113|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 426}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These international acts encouraged major changes to the workforce in India which occurred in 1986 when the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act was put into place. This act prohibited hiring children younger than the age of 14, and from working in hazardous conditions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Due to the increase of regulations and legal restrictions on child labour, there has been a 64 percent decline in child labour from 1993-2005.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|title = EBSCO Publishing Service Selection Page|url = http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=a9324979-b0a1-470b-a8a4-762ae940ce27%2540sessionmgr198&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=113|website = eds.b.ebscohost.com|accessdate = 2015-10-28|page = 422}}{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this is a great decrease in the country of India, there is still high numbers of children working in the rural areas of India.

India has legislation since 1986 which allows work by children in non-hazardous industry. In 2013, the Punjab and Haryana High Court gave a landmark order that directed that there shall be a total ban on the employment of children up to the age of 14 years, be it hazardous or non-hazardous industries. However, the Court ruled that a child can work with his or her family in family based trades/occupations, for the purpose of learning a new trade/craftsmanship or vocation.&lt;sup&gt;[142]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Ireland===
In post-colonial Ireland, the rate of child exploitation was extremely high as children were used as farm labourers once they were able to walk, these children were never paid for the labour that they carried out on the family farm. Children were wanted and desired in Ireland for the use of their labour on the family farm. Irish parents felt that it was the children's duty to carry out chores on the family farm &lt;ref&gt;Curtin, Chris and Anthony Varley. 1984.

===Japan===
Though banned in modern Japan, ''shonenko'' (child labourers) were a feature of the Imperial era until its end in 1945. During [[World War 2]] labour recruiting efforts targeted youths from [[Taiwan|Taiwan (Formosa)]], then a Japanese territory, with promises of educational opportunity. Though the target of 25,000 recruits was never reached, over 8,400 Taiwanese youths aged 12 to 14 relocated to Japan to help manufacture the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therunagatesclub.blogspot.tw/2008/06/shonenko-taiwanese-boys-who-built.html|title=SHONENKO - the Taiwanese boys who built Mitsubishi aircraft as Japan's defences crumbled|website=therunagatesclub.blogspot.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipixels.net/twff/shonenko-En.html|title=shonenko-En|website=ipixels.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quietsummer.com/Emeraldhorizon/SBackgroundE.html|title=SHONENKO - BACKGROUND|website=www.quietsummer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
[[Child labour in the Netherlands|Child labour]] existed in the Netherlands up to and through the Industrial Revolution. Laws governing child labour in factories were first passed in 1874, but child labour on farms continued to be the norm up until the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Soviet Union and Russia ===
Although formally banned since 1922, child labour was widespread in the [[Soviet Union]], mostly in the form of mandatory, [[unpaid work]] by schoolchildren on Saturdays and holidays. The students were used as a cheap, unqualified workforce on [[kolhoz|''kolhoz'' (collective farms)]] as well as in industry and forestry. The practice was formally called "work education".&lt;ref&gt;Svetlana Stephenson, [http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=child "Child Labour in the Russian Federation"], 2002, University of North London&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s on, the students were also used for unpaid work at schools, where they cleaned and performed repairs.&lt;ref&gt;Евгений Жирнов, [http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/798328 Среднее и высшее самообслуживание], 2007, Kommersant&lt;/ref&gt; This practice has continued in the Russian Federation, where up to 21 days of the summer holidays is sometimes set aside for school works. By law, this is only allowed as part of specialised occupational training and with the students' and parents' permission, but those provisions are widely ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://otvet.mail.ru/question/77019732|title=Ответы@Mail.Ru: Школьников заставляют работать в школьном участке в каникулах. 21 дней.

Out of former [[Soviet Union]] republics [[Uzbekistan]] continued and expanded the program of child labour on industrial scale to increase profits on the main source of [[Islam Karimov]]'s income, cotton harvesting. In September, when school normally starts, the classes are suspended and children are sent to cotton fields for work, where they are assigned daily quotas of 20 to 60&amp;nbsp;kg of raw cotton they have to collect. This process is repeated in spring, when collected cotton needs to be hoed and weeded. In 2006 it is estimated that 2.7 million children were forced to work this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty |author=[[Daron Acemoglu]], James Robinson |pages=loc. 6515–6529 (MOBI)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
{{Main|Child labour in Switzerland}}

As in many other countries, [[child labour in Switzerland]] affected among the so-called ''[[Kaminfegerkinder]]'' ("chimney sweep children") and children working p.e. in spinning mills, factories and in agriculture in 19th-century Switzerland,&lt;ref name="hds-kinderarbeit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D13909.php|title=Kinderabeit|publisher=HDS|author=Thomas Gull|language=German|date=2008-10-13|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also to the 1960s so-called ''[[Verdingkinder]]'' (literally: "contract children" or "indentured child laborers") were children who were taken from their parents, often due to poverty or ''moral reasons'' – usually mothers being unmarried, very poor citizens, of [[Names of the Romani people|Gypsy]]–[[Yeniche people|Yeniche]] origin, so-called ''[[Kinder der Landstrasse]]'',&lt;ref name="roger_sablonier_unizh-publikationen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hist.uzh.ch/fachbereiche/mittelalter/emeriti/sablonier/publikationen.html|title=Prof. Dr. Roger Sablonier, Publikationen|publisher=[[University of Zürich]], Historisches Seminar|language=German|date=|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; etc. – and sent to live with new families, often poor farmers who needed cheap labour.&lt;ref name="wiedergutmachungsinitiative"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiedergutmachung.ch/|title=Wiedergutmachungsinitiative|publisher=wiedergutmachung.ch|language=German|date=2014|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were even ''Verdingkinder'' auctions where children were handed over to the farmer asking the least amount of money from the authorities, thus securing cheap labour for his farm and relieving the authority from the financial burden of looking after the children. In the 1930s 20% of all agricultural labourers in the [[Canton of Bern]] were children below the age of 15. Swiss municipality guardianship authorities acted so, commonly tolerated by federal authorities, to the 1960s, not all of them of course, but usually communities affected of low taxes in some Swiss cantons&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; Swiss historian Marco Leuenberger investigated, that in 1930 there were some 35,000 indentured children, and between 1920 and 1970 more than 100,000 are believed to have been placed with families or homes. 10,000 ''Verdingkinder'' are still alive.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29765623|title=Switzerland's shame: The children used as cheap farm labour|publisher=BBC News|author=Kavita Puri|language=|date=2014-10-29|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/11/opinion/slaverys-shadow-on-switzerland.html?_r=0|title=Slavery’s Shadow on Switzerland|publisher=New York Times|author=Tony Wild|language=|date=2014-11-10|accessdate=2014-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the so-called ''[[Wiedergutmachungsinitiative]]'' was started in April 2014.

==Child labour laws and initiatives==
{{Main|Child labour laws}}
{{See also|Legal working age}}

Almost every country in the world has laws relating to and aimed at preventing child labour. International Labour Organization has helped set international law, which most countries have signed on and ratified. According to ILO [[Minimum Age Convention, 1973|minimum age convention (C138)]] of 1973, child labour refers to any work performed by children under the age of 12, non-light work done by children aged 12–14, and hazardous work done by children aged 15–17. Light work was defined, under this Convention, as any work that does not harm a child's health and development, and that does not interfere with his or her attendance at school. This convention has been ratified by 135 countries.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The United Nations adopted the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in 1990, which was subsequently ratified by 193 countries.&lt;ref name=untreaty&gt;United Nations Treaty Collection.  ''[http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-11&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en Convention on the Rights of the Child] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140211151110/http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-11&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en |date=11 February 2014 }}''. Retrieved 21 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Article 32 of the convention addressed child labour, as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;''...Parties recognise the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.''&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |work=United Nations |url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |accessdate=2006-10-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003230539/http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |archivedate=3 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under Article 1 of the 1990 Convention, a child is defined as "... every human being below the age of eighteen years unless, under the law applicable to the child, a majority is attained earlier." Article 28 of this Convention requires States to, "make primary education compulsory and available free to all."&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt;

195 countries are party to the Convention; only two nations have not ratified the treaty, [[Somalia]] and the [[US ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child|United States]].&lt;ref name="untreaty"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Government of Somalia ratifies UN Convention on the Rights of the Child|url=http://www.unicef.org/media/media_78732.html?p=printme|publisher=UNICEF|accessdate=20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, ILO helped lead the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|Worst Forms Convention 182]] (C182),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=C182 - Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999|publisher=International Labour Organization, United Nations|year=1999|url=http://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=1000:12100:0::NO::P12100_INSTRUMENT_ID:312327}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has so far been signed upon and domestically ratified by 151 countries including the United States. This international law prohibits worst forms of child labour, defined as all forms of slavery and slavery-like practices, such as child trafficking, debt bondage, and forced labour, including forced recruitment of children into armed conflict. The law also prohibits the use of a child for prostitution or the production of pornography, child labour in illicit activities such as drug production and trafficking; and in hazardous work. Both the Worst Forms Convention (C182) and the Minimum Age Convention (C138) are examples of [[international labour standards]] implemented through the ILO that deal with child labour.

In addition to setting the international law, the United Nations initiated International Program on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC)|publisher=International Labour Organization, United Nations|year=2011|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/lang--en/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative aims to progressively eliminate child labour through strengthening national capacities to address some of the causes of child labour. Amongst the key initiative is the so-called time-bounded programme countries, where child labour is most prevalent and schooling opportunities lacking. The initiative seeks to achieve amongst other things, universal primary school availability. The IPEC has expanded to at least the following target countries: Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, El Salvador, [[Child labour in Nepal|Nepal]], Tanzania, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Philippines, Senegal, South Africa and Turkey.

Targeted child labour campaigns were initiated by the [[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]] (IPEC) in order to advocate for prevention and elimination of all forms of child labour. The global Music against Child Labour Initiative was launched in 2013 in order to involve socially excluded children in structured musical activity and education in efforts to help protect them from child labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Music Against Child Labour Initiative|publisher= IPEC, International Labour Organization, United Nations|year=2013|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Campaignandadvocacy/MusicInitiative/lang--en/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exceptions granted===
[[File:Amish - On the way to school by Gadjoboy-crop.jpg|thumb|right|The United States has passed a law that allows Amish children older than 14 to work in traditional wood enterprises with proper supervision.]]

In 2004, the United States passed an amendment to the Fair Labour Standards Act of 1938. The amendment allows certain children aged 14–18 to work in or outside a business where machinery is used to process wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exemptions from Child Labour Rules in Non-Agriculture (see FLSA Section 13(c)(7))|publisher=Department of Labour, United States|year=2012|url=http://www.dol.gov/elaws/esa/flsa/cl/exemptions.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law aims to respect the religious and cultural needs of the [[Amish]] community of the United States. The Amish believe that one effective way to educate children is on the job.&lt;ref name="Labour laws - An Amish exception"/&gt; The new law allows Amish children the ability to work with their families, once they are passed eighth grade in school.

Similarly, in 1996, member countries of the European Union, per Directive 94/33/EC,&lt;ref name="EUR-Lex"/&gt; agreed to a number of exceptions for young people in its child labour laws. Under these rules, children of various ages may work in cultural, artistic, sporting or advertising activities if authorised by the competent authority. Children above the age of 13 &lt;!--  --&gt;may perform light work for a limited number of hours per week in other economic activities as defined at the discretion of each country. Additionally, the European law exception allows children aged 14 years or over to work as part of a work/training scheme. The EU Directive clarified that these exceptions do not allow child labour where the children may experience harmful exposure to dangerous substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protections of young people at work|publisher=Europa|year=2004|url=http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/employment_and_social_policy/health_hygiene_safety_at_work/c11205_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, many children under the age of 13 do work, even in the most developed countries of the EU. For instance, a recent study showed over a third of Dutch twelve-year-old kids had a job, the most common being babysitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}}[http://www.rtl.nl/%28/actueel/editienl/cookieless/%29/components/actueel/editienl/nieuws/2012/w07/12-jarige-werken.xml Eenderde van de 12-jarigen heeft bijbaan] (RTL News, 14 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

===More laws vs. more freedom===
{{Rquote|right|Very often, however, these state laws were not enforced... Federal legislation was passed in 1916 and again in 1919, but both laws were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.

Scholars disagree on the best legal course forward to address child labour. Some suggest the need for laws that place a blanket ban on any work by children less than 18 years old. Others suggest the current international laws are enough, and the need for more engaging approach to achieve the ultimate goals.&lt;ref name=sosecon&gt;{{cite news|title=Sickness or symptom? - Child Labour|publisher=The Economist|date=5 February 2004|url=http://www.economist.com/node/2405051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{who|date=January 2016}} suggest any labour by children aged 18 years or less is wrong since this encourages illiteracy, inhumane work and lower investment in human capital. Child labour, claim these activists, also leads to poor labour standards for adults, depresses the wages of adults in developing countries as well as the developed countries, and dooms the third world economies to low-skill jobs only capable of producing poor quality cheap exports. More children that work in poor countries, the fewer and worse-paid are the jobs for adults in these countries. In other words, there are moral and economic reasons that justify a blanket ban on labour from children aged 18 years or less, everywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Is Child Labour Inefficient?|author=Jean‐Marie Baland and James A.

[[File:Child labor Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|Child labour in [[Bangladesh]].]]

Other scholars{{who|date=January 2016}} suggest that these arguments are flawed, ignores history and more laws will do more harm than good. According to them, child labour is merely the symptom of a greater disease named poverty. If laws ban all lawful work that enables the poor to survive, informal economy, illicit operations and underground businesses will thrive. These will increase abuse of the children. In poor countries with very high incidence rates of child labour - such as Ethiopia, Chad, Niger and Nepal - schools are not available, and the few schools that exist offer poor quality education or are unaffordable. The alternatives for children who currently work, claim these studies, are worse: grinding subsistence farming, militia or prostitution. Child labour is not a choice, it is a necessity, the only option for survival. It is currently the least undesirable of a set of very bad choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Policy Analysis of Child Labour: A Comparative Study|author1=Christiaan Grootaert |author2=Harry Anthony Patrinos |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1999|pages=8–54|isbn=978-0312221225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Economics of Consumer Actions against Products with Child Labour Content|author=Eric Edmonds|date=May 2007|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~eedmonds/clwa.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These scholars suggest, from their studies of economic and social data, that early 20th-century child labour in Europe and the United States ended in large part as a result of the economic development of the formal regulated economy, technology development and general prosperity. Child labour laws and ILO conventions came later. Edmonds suggests, even in contemporary times, the incidence of child labour in Vietnam has rapidly reduced following economic reforms and GDP growth. These scholars suggest economic engagement, emphasis on opening quality schools rather than more laws and expanding economically relevant skill development opportunities in the third world. International legal actions, such as trade sanctions increase child labour.&lt;ref name=sosecon/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Does Child Labour Decline with Improving Economic Status?|author=Eric Edmonds|journal=Journal of Human Resources| volume=40|number= 1|date=Winter 2005|pages=77–99|doi=10.3368/jhr.XL.1.77}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The economics of child labour: A framework for measurement|author=Richard ANKER|journal=International Labour Review|volume=139|issue=3|pages=257–280|date=September 2000|doi=10.1111/j.1564-913X.2000.tb00204.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Will trade sanctions reduce child labour?: The role of credit markets|author1=Saqib Jafareya |author2=Sajal Lahiri |journal=Journal of Development Economics|volume=68|issue=1|date=June 2002|pages=137–156|doi=10.1016/S0304-3878(02)00009-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[The Incredible Bread Machine]]", a book published by "World Research, Inc." in 1974, stated:

{{blockquote|Child labour was a particular target of early reformers. William Cooke Tatlor wrote at the time about these reformers who, witnessing children at work in the factories, thought to themselves: 'How much more delightful would have been the gambol of the free limbs on the hillside; the sight of the green mead with its spangles of buttercups and daisies; the song of the bird and the humming bee...'
But for many of these children the factory system meant quite literally the only chance for survival. Today we overlook the fact that death from starvation and exposure was a common fate before the Industrial Revolution, for the pre-capitalist economy was barely able to support the population. Yes, children were working. Formerly they would have starved. It was only as goods were produced in greater abundance at a lower cost that men could support their families without sending their children to work. It was not the reformer or the politician that ended the grim necessity for child labour; it was capitalism.}}

===Mining in Africa===
[[File:Diamond miners-1-.jpg|thumb|Children engaged in diamond mining in [[Sierra Leone]].]]

In 2008, Bloomberg claimed child labour in [[copper]] and [[cobalt]] mines that supplied Chinese companies in Congo. The children are ''creuseurs'', that is they dig the ore by hand, carry sacks of ores on their backs, and these are then purchased by these companies. Over 60 of [[Katanga Province|Katanga's]] 75 processing plants are owned by Chinese companies and 90 percent of the region's minerals go to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=China Lets Child Workers Die Digging in Congo Mines for Copper|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=22 July 2008|author1=Simon Clark |author2=Michael Smith |author3=Franz Wild |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aW8xVLQ4Xhr8|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112063831/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aW8xVLQ4Xhr8|dead-url=yes|archive-date=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An African NGO report claimed 80,000 child labourers under the age of 15, or about 40% of all miners, were supplying ore to Chinese companies in this African region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strengthening the Civil society Perspective: China’s African impact |pages=9–15 |author=Stephen Marks |year=2010 |publisher=Fahamu |url=http://www.fahamu.org/downloads/strengthening_the_civil_society_perspective.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104005117/http://www.fahamu.org/downloads/strengthening_the_civil_society_perspective.pdf |archivedate=4 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC, in 2012, accused [[Glencore]] of using child labour in its mining and smelting operations of Africa. Glencore denied it used child labour, and said it has strict policy of not using child labour. The company claimed it has a strict policy whereby all copper was mined correctly, placed in bags with numbered seals and then sent to the smelter. Glencore mentioned being aware of child miners who were part of a group of artisanal miners who had without authorisation raided the concession awarded to the company since 2010; Glencore has been pleading with the government to remove the artisanal miners from the concession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mining giant Glencore accused in child labour and acid dumping row|author=John Sweeney|publisher=The Guardian|date=14 April 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/apr/14/glencore-child-labour-acid-dumping-row}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale [[artisanal mining]] of gold is another source of dangerous child labour in poor rural areas in certain parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Poisonous Mix - Child Labour, Mercury, and Artisanal Gold Mining in Mali|author=Human Rights Watch|year=2011|url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/mali1211_forinsertWebUpload_0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of mining uses labour-intensive and low-tech methods. It is informal sector of the economy. Human Rights Watch group estimates that about 12 percent of global gold production comes from artisanal mines. In west Africa, in countries such as [[Mali]] - the third largest exporter of gold in Africa - between 20,000 and 40,000 children work in artisanal mining. Locally known as ''orpaillage'', children as young as 6 years old work with their families. These children and families suffer chronic exposure to toxic chemicals including [[Mercury poisoning|mercury]], and do hazardous work such as digging shafts and working underground, pulling up, carrying and crushing the ore. The poor work practices harm the long term health of children, as well as release hundreds of tons of mercury every year into local rivers, ground water and lakes. Gold is important to the economy of Mali and Ghana. For Mali, it is the second largest earner of its export revenue. For many poor families with children, it is the primary and sometimes the only source of income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Child labour in gold mining|publisher=ILO, United Nations|year=2012|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/areas/Miningandquarrying/MoreaboutCLinmining/lang--en/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artisanal Gold Mining: Unglamorous Practices at High Prices |author=Sandra Garcia |publisher=Mining Magazine |date=April 2010 |url=http://magazine.mining.com/issues/1003/Vol03-02-ArtisanalGoldMining-36-38.pdf }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meatpacking===
In early August 2008, [[Iowa]] Labour Commissioner David Neil announced that his department had found that [[Agriprocessors]], a [[kosher]] [[meatpacking]] company in [[Postville, Iowa|Postville]] which had recently been raided by [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]], had employed 57 minors, some as young as 14, in violation of state law prohibiting anyone under 18 from working in a meatpacking plant.  Neil announced that he was turning the case over to the state Attorney General for prosecution, claiming that his department's inquiry had discovered "egregious violations of virtually every aspect of Iowa's child labour laws."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/06/us/06meat.html?hp Inquiry Finds Under-Age Workers at Meat Plant.] The New York Times.&lt;/ref&gt; Agriprocessors claimed that it was at a loss to understand the allegations. Agriprocessors' CEO went to trial on these charges in state court on 4 May 2010. After a five-week trial he was found not guilty of all 57 charges of child labour violations by the Black Hawk County District Court jury in Waterloo, Iowa, on 7 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Preston (7 June 2010).

===GAP===
[[File:Ooty 15.jpg|thumbnail|Working child in [[Ooty]], India]]
A 2007 report claimed some GAP products had been produced by child labourers. GAP acknowledged the problem and announced it is pulling the products from its shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/oct/28/ethicalbusiness.india|title=Child sweatshop shame threatens Gap's ethical image|first=Dan|last=McDougall|date=28 October 2007|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report found Gap had rigorous social audit systems since 2004 to eliminate child labour in its supply chain. However, the report concluded that the system was being abused by unscrupulous subcontractors.

GAP's policy, the report claimed, is that if it discovers child labour was used by its supplier in its branded clothes, the contractor must remove the child from the workplace, provide it with access to schooling and a wage, and guarantee the opportunity of work on reaching a legal working age.

In 2007, The New York Times reported that GAP, after the child labour discovery, created a $200,000 grant to improve working conditions in the supplier community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/15/business/worldbusiness/15iht-gap.1.8349422.html|title=Gap moves to recover from child labor scandal|first=Amelia|last=Gentleman|date=15 November 2007|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===H&amp;M and Zara===
In December 2009, campaigners in the UK called on two leading high street retailers to stop selling clothes made with cotton which may have been picked by children. [[Anti-Slavery International]] and the [[Environmental Justice Foundation]] (EJF) accused [[H&amp;M]] and [[Zara (clothing)|Zara]] of using cotton suppliers in Bangladesh. It is also suspected that many of their raw materials originates from Uzbekistan, where children aged 10 are forced to work in the fields. The activists were calling to ban the use of Uzbek cotton and implement a "track and trace" systems to guarantee an ethical responsible source of the material.

H&amp;M said it "does not accept" child labour and "seeks to avoid" using Uzbek cotton, but admitted it did "not have any reliable methods" to ensure Uzbek cotton did not end up in any of its products. [[Inditex]], the owner of Zara, said its code of conduct banned child labour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://itn.co.uk/d42d75c1cd515910d3b780d161e03b0d.html "Stores urged to stop using child labour cotton"] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silk weaving===
A 2003 Human Rights Watch report claimed children as young as five years old were employed and worked for up to 12 hours a day and six to seven days a week in silk industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://inhome.rediff.com/news/2003/jan/23silk.htm|title=Indian silk industry employs child labour: Human Rights Watch|date=23 January 2003|publisher=[[Rediff]]|accessdate = 2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children, HRW claimed, were bonded [[child labour in India]], easy to find in [[Karnataka]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl1801/18010660.htm|title=Child Labour: Blood on silk |work=[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]|accessdate = 2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a German news investigative report claimed that in silk weaving industry, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) had found up to 10,000 children working in the 1,000 silk factories in 1998. In other places, thousands of bonded child labour were present in 1994. After UNICEF and NGOs got involved, after 2005, child labour figure is drastically lower, with the total estimated to be fewer than a thousand child labourers. The released children were back in school, claims the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India: Freeing the Small Hands of the Silk Industry|publisher=Deutsche Welle (Germany)|year=2010|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,1114659,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primark===
In 2008, the BBC reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7468927.stm|title=BBC News - Embroidered T-shirt. Price: £4. Cost: Misery|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the company [[Primark]] was using child labour in the manufacture of clothing. In particular, a £4 hand-embroidered shirt was the starting point of a documentary produced by [[BBC]]'s ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme. The programme asks consumers to ask themselves, "Why am I only paying £4 for a hand embroidered top? This item looks handmade. Who made it for such little cost?", in addition to exposing the violent side of the child labour industry in countries where child exploitation is prevalent.

As a result of the BBC report, Royal Television Society awarded it a prize, and Primark took immediate action and fired three Indian suppliers in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7456897.stm|title=BBC News - Primark fires child worker firms|website=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primark continued to investigate the allegations for three years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primarkresponse.com/panorama/timeline-of-events/ Primark's Investigation findings of BBC's fake reporting on child labour, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911094612/http://www.primarkresponse.com/panorama/timeline-of-events/ |date=11 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that BBC report was a fake.

==Eliminating child labour==
[[File:Childlabourcoal.jpg|thumb|Child labour in a coal mine, [[United States]], c. 1912. Photograph by [[Lewis Hine]].]]

Concerns have often been raised over the buying public's moral complicity in purchasing products assembled or otherwise manufactured in [[developing countries]] with child labour. However, others have raised concerns that [[boycott]]ing products manufactured through child labour may force these children to turn to more dangerous or strenuous professions, such as prostitution or agriculture. For example, a [[UNICEF]] study found that after the [[Child Labor Deterrence Act|Child Labour Deterrence Act]] was introduced in the US, an estimated 50,000 children were dismissed from their garment industry jobs in [[Bangladesh]], leaving many to resort to jobs such as "stone-crushing, street hustling, and prostitution", jobs that are "more hazardous and exploitative than garment production". The study suggests that boycotts are "blunt instruments with long-term consequences, that can actually harm rather than help the children involved."&lt;ref name="unicef"/&gt;

According to [[Milton Friedman]], before the Industrial Revolution virtually all children worked in agriculture.&lt;ref name="Schultz2010"&gt;"Some authors such as conservative Nobel economist Milton Friedman claim that child labour actually decreased during the industrial revolution. He argues that before the industrial revolution almost all children were working in agriculture(...)" {{cite book|author=Robert A. Schultz|title=Information Technology and the Ethics of Globalization: Transnational Issues and Implications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Fk7pHWGERoC|accessdate=7 July 2013|year=2010|publisher=IGI Global Snippet|isbn=978-1-60566-923-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Industrial Revolution many of these children moved from farm work to factory work.  Over time, as real wages rose, parents became able to afford to send their children to school instead of work and as a result child labour declined, both before and after legislation.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Cunningham, "The Employment and Unemployment of Children in England c.1680–1851." ''Past and Present''. Feb. 1990. {{doi|10.1093/past/126.1.115}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Austrian School]] economist [[Murray Rothbard]] said that British and American children of the pre- and post-Industrial Revolution lived and suffered in infinitely worse conditions where jobs were not available for them and went "voluntarily and gladly" to work in factories.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Rothbard, [https://www.mises.org/daily/1607 Down With Primitivism: A Thorough Critique of Polanyi] [[Ludwig Von Mises Institute]], reprint of June 1961 article.&lt;/ref&gt;

British historian and socialist [[E. P. Thompson]] in ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' draws a qualitative distinction between child domestic work and participation in the wider (waged) labour market.&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt; Further, the usefulness of the experience of the industrial revolution in making predictions about current trends has been disputed. Social historian Hugh Cunningham, author of ''Children and Childhood in Western Society Since 1500'', notes that:
:''"Fifty years ago it might have been assumed that, just as child labour had declined in the developed world in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, so it would also, in a trickle-down fashion, in the rest of the world. Its failure to do that, and its re-emergence in the developed world, raise questions about its role in any economy, whether national or global."''&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Cunningham, "The decline of child labour: labour markets and family economies in Europe and North America since 1830", ''Economic History Review'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Thomas DeGregori, an economics professor at the [[University of Houston]], in an article published by the [[Cato Institute]], a [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] think-tank operating in Washington D.C., "it is clear that technological and economic change are vital ingredients in getting children out of the workplace and into schools. Then they can grow to become productive adults and live longer, healthier lives. However, in poor countries like Bangladesh, working children are essential for survival in many families, as they were in our own heritage until the late 19th century. So, while the struggle to end child labour is necessary, getting there often requires taking different routes—and, sadly, there are many political obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;DeGregori, Thomas R., [http://www.cato.org/dailys/10-08-02.html "Child Labour or Child Prostitution?"] Cato Institute. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013140459/http://www.cato.org/dailys/10-08-02.html |date=13 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]] (IPEC), founded in 1992, aims to eliminate child labour. It operates in 88 countries and is the largest program of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name=ipec&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/ipec/programme/lang--en/|title=About the International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) (IPEC)|website=www.ilo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; IPEC works with international and government agencies, NGOs, the media, and children and their families to end child labour and provide children with education and assistance.&lt;ref name=ipec/&gt;

From 2008 to 2013, the [[ILO]] operated a program through [[International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour]] (IPEC) entitled "Combating Abusive Child Labour (CACL-II)". The project, funded by the [[European Union]], contributed to the [[Government of Pakistan]] by providing alternative opportunities for vocational training and education to children withdrawn from the worst forms of child labour.&lt;ref name="Combating Abusive Child Labour II"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/islamabad/whatwedo/projects/WCMS_143210/lang--en/index.htm|title=Combating Abusive Child Labour II|date=1 April 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodically, governments, employers' and workers' organisations have met in global conference to assess progress and remaining obstacles and to agree measures to eliminate the worst forms of child labour by 2016: first in [[Oslo]] (1997), secondly in [[The Hague]] (2010); the third Global Conference on Child Labour took place in [[Brasilia]], 8010 October 2013,&lt;ref&gt;ILO, [http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Campaignandadvocacy/BrasiliaConference/lang--en/index.htm III Global Conference on Child Labour - Brasilia, 8-10 October 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourth global conference is scheduled to be held in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]], 14–16 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;ILO, [http://www.ilo.org/ipec/Campaignandadvocacy/BuenosAiresConference/lang--it/index.htm IV Global Conference on the Sustained Eradication of Child Labour, Buenos Aires, 14-16 November 2017], accessed 17 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential positives of children working==

The term child labour can be misleading when it confuses harmful work with employment that may be beneficial to children. It can also ignore harmful work outside employment and any benefits children normally derive from their work.&lt;ref&gt;For examples see Bourdillon et al pp 1-6, 180-194.  Pp 195-200 offer an alternative and more effective approach to protecting working children.&lt;/ref&gt;  Domestic work is an example: all families but the rich must work at cleaning, cooking, caring, and more to maintain their homes. In most families in the world, this process extends to productive activities, especially herding and various types of agriculture,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Polak|first=Barbara|contribution=Bamana Peasants' Children at Work: Deconstructing Stereotypes of Child Work|year=2012|title= African Children at Work: Working and Learning in Growing Up for Life|publisher=LIT Verlag|location=Berlin|editor=Gerd Spittler and Michael Bourdillon}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and to a variety of small family businesses. Where trading is a significant feature of social life, children can start trading in small items at an early age, often in the company of family members or of peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Invernizzi|first=Antonella|title=Street-Working Children and Adolescents in Lima: Work as an Agent of Socialization|journal=Childhood|date=2003|volume=10|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Work is undertaken from an early age by vast numbers of children in the world and may have a natural place in growing up.&lt;ref name="Bourdillon 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdillon|first=Michael|title=Rights and Wrongs of Children's Work|date=2010|publisher=Rutgers University Press|location=New Brunswick|author2=Deborah Levison |author3=William Myers |author4=Ben White }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Work can contribute to the well-being of children in a variety of ways;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdillon|first=Michael|title="Children's Work" in Handbook of Child-Well Being|date=2013|publisher=Springer|editor=Asher Ben-Arieh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  children often choose to work to improve their lives, both in the short- and long-term. At the material level, children’s work often contributes to producing food or earning income that benefits themselves and their families; and such income is especially important when the families are poor. Work can provide an escape from debilitating poverty, sometimes by allowing a young person to move away from an impoverished environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hashim|first=Iman M.|title=Child Migration in Africa|date=2011|publisher=Zed Books|location=London|author2=Dorte Thorsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young people often enjoy their work, especially paid work, or when work involves the company of peers. Even when work is intensive and enforced, children often find ways to combine their work with play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katz|first=Cindi|title=Growing Up Global: Economic Restructuring and Children's Everyday Lives|date=2004|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While full-time work hinders schooling, empirical evidence is varied on the relationship between part-time work and school.&lt;ref name="Bourdillon 2010"/&gt;   Sometimes even part-time work may hinder school attendance or performance.  On the other hand, many poor children work for resources to attend school. Children who are not doing well at school sometimes seek more satisfactory experience in work. Good relations with a supervisor at work can provide relief from tensions that children feel at school and home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Call|first=Kathleen|title=Arenas of Comfort in Adolescence: A Study of Adjustment in Context|date=2001|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=London|author2=Jeylan T. Mortimer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the modern world, school education has become so central to society that schoolwork has become the dominant work for most children,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last =Qvortrup|first =Jens |contribution =School-Work, Paid Work and the Changing Obligations of Childhood|year =2001|title =Hidden Hands: International Perspectives on Children's Work and Labour|editor-last =Mizen|editor-first =Philip|place =London|publisher =Routledge.}}&lt;/ref&gt; often replacing participation in productive work. If school curricula or quality do not provide children with appropriate skills for available jobs or if children do nor have the aptitude for schoolwork, school may impede the learning of skills, such as agriculture, which will become necessary for future livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first=Ben|title=Agriculture and the Generation Problem: Rural Youth, Employment, and the Future of Farming|journal=IDS Bulletin|date=2012|volume=43|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian Arno''' (born 1 December 1978) is the founder and Managing Director of UK translation company [[Lingo24]].

Arno established Lingo24 as a 22-year-old [[Oxford University]] graduate in 2001. He won the Shell LiveWIRE ‘Young Entrepreneur of the Year’ award in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shell-livewire.org/business-library/case-studies/lingo24 Shell LiveWIRE, Christian Arno, Lingo24] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714171955/http://www.shell-livewire.org/business-library/case-studies/lingo24 |date=14 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, he is a finalist in the ‘Entrepreneur of the Year’ category at the 2009 National Business Awards for [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/scotland/City-translators-spoken-highly-of.5229746.jp Edinburgh Evening News, City Translators Spoken Highly of in Prize Shortlist, 2 May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Arno has also become a business commentator, and has been enlisted by Brand Republic to give advice for businesses seeking to globalise,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediazone.brighttalk.com/comm/Haymarket/d1dd4377ce-12987-2822-13302 Brand Republic, Tapping into Emerging Markets through Effective Communications, April 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; while the Sunday Times,&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/entrepreneur/article6299766.ece Sunday Times, How I Made it: Christian Arno, founder of Lingo24.com, 17 May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Telegraph,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lingo24.com/resources/pdf/The_Telegraph_19th_May_2009.pdf The Telegraph, Speaking in mother tongues translates into a success story, 19 May 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611165125/http://www.lingo24.com/resources/pdf/The_Telegraph_19th_May_2009.pdf |date=11 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Financial Times&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lingo24.com/resources/pdf/Financial_Times_18th_April_2009.pdf Financial Times, Messages of doom don't mean the end of the world, 18 April 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; have also used Arno and Lingo24 as a case study in a range of business features.

Arno has also contracted to work for Smarta, an online support platform for business owners and entrepreneurs backed by [[Deborah Meaden]] from [[Dragons' Den]], to provide expert advice to entrepreneurs looking to grow their businesses,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smarta.com/inspiration/comment/christian-arno Smarta, Who is Christian?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614180700/http://www.smarta.com/inspiration/comment/christian-arno |date=14 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was also part of a panel of experts for the Guardian newspaper's Live Q&amp;A session: what can I do with a degree in languages?, in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://careers.guardian.co.uk/careers-blog/live-q-a-what-can-i-do-with-a-degree-in-languages The Guardian, Live Q&amp;A session: what can I do with a degree in languages? 21 July 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2010, Arno was commissioned to provide regular columns for a number of online publications, such as Econsultancy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/authors/christian-arno-2 Econsultancy]&lt;/ref&gt; Search Engine Journal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchenginejournal.com/author/christian-arno/ Search Engine Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; Search Engine Watch

'''Counselor Education''' is a field focused on the preparation of students to professionally apply the theory and principles of guidance and counseling for the personal, social, educational, and vocational development of others.&lt;ref&gt;https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/cipdetail.aspx?y=55&amp;cipid=88130&lt;/ref&gt; The primary focus of counselor education is the training and preparation of professional counselors; this includes recruiting and training the future generations of academic professionals who will teach the curriculum of counseling theory and practice.  

In order to acquire licensure, counselors are generally required to complete an accredited graduate program along with a minimum number of documented hours in supervised clinical fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;https://onlinecounselingprograms.com/become-a-counselor/&lt;/ref&gt; Counselor Education degree programs can become accredited by The Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs. Rehabilitation Counselor Education degree programs can become accredited by The National Council on Rehabilitation Education.

Scholarship within counselor education centers on the training and education of master's or doctoral-level counseling graduate students, novel applications of counseling theory including competencies across cultural groups, and best practice guidelines in both academic and clinical or applied settings. Counselor educators as a professional group are trained in multiple methodological approaches to research including both qualitative and quantitative methods.

He was known for working newly released prisoners as [[Gum-digger|gum diggers]] and trading the gum for a profit.&lt;ref name=Waitakere&gt;[http://www.waitakere.govt.nz/AbtCit/ei/pdfs/urbanstudies/donbuck.pdf Waitakere History]&lt;/ref&gt; He is seen as a mixed figure; this is mostly because of the perceived conflict between his profiteering and his making use of criminals and ex-criminals.

==Biography==
Little is known of Don Buck's early life.

He tried various business, all of which failed, before moving out to [[Henderson, New Zealand]], in 1911, when he started gum-digging at the recommendation of some locals;&lt;ref name=Waitakere/&gt; Kauri gum was at that time experiencing considerable prospecting attention in [[New Zealand]], of which it became an important product for a short time. From there, he moved out near Swanson Stream and built his abode on some likely prospecting land.&lt;ref name=Waitakere/&gt; There, he found an abundance of gum, but was not able to do the work to remove it himself, due to a heart condition. He persuaded the Police Magistrates in the [[Auckland]] Courts, that they should give convicted criminals the option of working at his camp, or serving a sentence in jail.&lt;ref name=Waitakere/&gt; Alongside this, multiple ex-prisoners without any prospects were sent to him.

On top of gaining a profit from selling the gum, he made gain by renting out shacks to prospectors.&lt;ref name=Waitakere/&gt;

Don Buck did not supply alcohol (he himself did not drink, again due to his heart condition), but drunkenness was not rare at his camp, since there were several near-by vineyards.&lt;ref name=Waitakere/&gt; During one drunken bout in the camp, a murder was reported to have happened. The police did not take the much interest in the matter, and after it was found that the victim had drunk large amounts of alcohol prior to his death, the case became stagnant.&lt;ref name=Waitakere/&gt;

Don Buck died suddenly on 5 August 1917, one day after suffering a [[heart attack]].&lt;ref name=Waitakere/&gt; He was buried in a [[pauper]]'s grave in Waikumete Cemetery, originally with an un-marked or poorly marked grave. The grave has since been marked with a gravestone as a result of a campaign and financing by local historian Marianne Simpkins.

==Commemoration==
Don Buck Road in [[Massey, New Zealand]] is named after him.

The Huruhuru Stream (also known as the Swanson Stream) is known locally as Don Buck Creek from Don Buck Road down to where the Northwestern Motorway crosses it.

Don Buck Primary School, which is located part way along Don Buck Road, is also named in his honour: http://www.donbuck.school.nz/

[[File:East Point Business Park (pond).jpg|thumb|East Point Business Park (pond)]]

There are over 50 companies in the park with 6,000 employees.

==History==
The park is situated on land reclaimed from [[Dublin Bay]] and the [[River Tolka]] estuary. The first phase of the park was opened for business around 1996. 
The site where EastPoint is located was intended to be a location for a new City Airport in Dublin, similar to [[London City Airport]]. When this plan ultimately proved impractical, the site was acquired by Earlsfort Centre Developments.

Earlsfort engaged Scott Tallon Walker to design the Park and the buildings and the landscaping was designed by Charles Funke.
It became necessary, because of the route of the [[Dublin Port Tunnel]], to construct a new bridge and causeway from Alfie Byrne Road to access the Park.

The success of the initial phase of EastPoint led to Earlsfort and Dublin Port Company entering a joint venture to develop a further phase. This brought the size of the Park to Circa {{convert|40|acre|m2}} with Circa 140,000 square meters (1.5 m square feet) of mainly offices in 37 buildings. This also provided a further entrance to the Park from Bond Road thus enhancing access from the South City.

==Major companies==
Major companies based in East Point Office Park include among others [[Yahoo!]], [[Cisco]], [[Google]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Enterprise Ireland]], [[Deutsche Bank]], CITRIX Systems, QuintilesIms, Ergo, FINEOS and [[UPC Broadband|UPC]].

[[Enterprise Ireland]] leased one of the buildings within the park to serve as its new head office, in a move aimed at merging its four Dublin offices together at one central location, from the end of 2007.

== Location ==
EastPoint is Dublin’s only central office park, located less than 2 kilometres from the [[International Financial Services Centre]] (IFSC), the purpose-built [[Convention Centre Dublin]] overlooking the [[River Liffey]], and other landmarks such as the [[3Arena]] (formerly known as The O2) venue at the [[Point Village]].

'''European competition law''' is the [[competition law]] in use within the European Union. It promotes the maintenance of competition within the  [[European Single Market]] by regulating anti-competitive conduct by companies to ensure that they do not create [[cartels]] and [[monopolies]] that would damage the interests of society. 

European competition law today derives mostly from articles [[Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|101]] to 109 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (TFEU), as well as a series of Regulations and Directives. Four main policy areas include:

*[[Cartel]]s, or control of [[collusion]] and other [[anti-competitive practices]], under article 101 TFEU.
*[[Monopoly|Market dominance]], or preventing the abuse of firms' [[Dominant market position|dominant market positions]] under article 102 TFEU.
*[[Mergers and acquisitions|Mergers]], control of proposed mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures involving companies that have a certain, defined amount of turnover in the EU, according to the [[European Union merger law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004R0139:EN:NOT|title=EUR-Lex - 32004R0139 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[State aid]], control of direct and indirect aid given by [[Member state of the European Union|Member States of the European Union]] to companies under [[TFEU]] article 107.

Primary authority for applying competition law within the [[European Union]] rests with [[European Commission]] and its Directorate General for Competition, although state aids in some sectors, such as agriculture, are handled by other Directorates General. The Directorates can mandate that improperly-given state aid be repaid, as was the case in 2012 with [[Malev Hungarian Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-01-09/hungary-s-malev-airline-ordered-by-eu-to-repay-state-support.html|title=Terms of Service Violation|website=www.businessweek.com|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading [[European Court of Justice|ECJ]] cases on competition law include ''[[Consten SaRL and Grundig GmbH v Commission|Consten &amp; Grundig v Commission]]'' and ''[[United Brands Company v Commission of the European Communities|United Brands v Commission]]''.

==History==
{{See also|History of competition law}}
{{quote box|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|width=22em|salign=right|quote="people of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices. It is impossible indeed to prevent such meetings, by any law which either could be executed, or would be consistent with liberty and justice. But though the law cannot hinder people of the same trade from sometimes assembling together, it ought to do nothing to facilitate such assemblies; much less to render them necessary."|source=[[A Smith]], ''[[Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776) [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Wealth_of_Nations/Book_I/Chapter_10 Book I, ch 10]}}
One of the paramount aims of the founding fathers of the European Community - statesmen around [[Jean Monnet]] and [[Robert Schuman]] - was the establishment of a Single Market. To achieve this, a compatible, transparent and fairly standardised regulatory framework for Competition Law had to be created. The constitutive legislative act was Council Regulation 17/62&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31962R0017:EN:NOT |title=EEC Council: Regulation No 17: First Regulation implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now superseded). The wording of Reg 17/62 was developed in a pre ''Van Gend en Loos'' period in EC legal evolution, when the supremacy of EC law was not yet fully established. To avoid different interpretations of EC Competition Law, which could vary from one national court to the next, the Commission was made to assume the role of central enforcement authority.

The first major decision under Article 101 (then Article 85) was taken by the Commission in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31964D0566:EN:NOT 64/566/CEE: Décision de la Commission, du 23 septembre 1964, relative à une procédure au titre de l'article 85 du traité (IV-A/00004-03344 «Grundig-Consten»)] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that [[Grundig]], a German manufacturer of household appliances, acted illegally in granting exclusive dealership rights to its French subsidiary. In ''Consten &amp; Grundig'' [1966] the [[European Court of Justice]] upheld the Commission's decision, expanded the definition of measures affecting trade to include "potential effects" {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}, and generally anchored its key position in Competition Law enforcement alongside the Commission. Subsequent enforcement of Art 101 of the TFEU Treaty (combating anti-competitive business agreements) by the two institutions has generally been regarded as effective. Yet some analysts assert that the Commission's [[monopoly]] policy (the enforcement of Art 102) has been "largely ineffective",&lt;ref&gt;See, Cini &amp; McGowan&lt;/ref&gt; because of the resistance of individual Member State governments that sought to shield their most salient national companies from legal challenges. The Commission also received criticism from the academic quarters. For instance, Valentine Korah, an eminent legal analyst in the field, argued that the Commission was too strict in its application of EC Competition rules and often ignored the dynamics of [[Corporate behaviour|company behaviour]], which, in her opinion, could actually be beneficial to consumers and to the quality of available goods in some cases.

Nonetheless, the arrangements in place worked fairly well until the mid-1980s, when it became clear that with the passage of time, as the European economy steadily grew in size and anti-competitive activities and market practices became more complex in nature, the Commission would eventually be unable to deal with its workload.&lt;ref&gt;See Gerber &amp; Cassinis&lt;/ref&gt; The central dominance of the [[Directorate-General for Competition (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Competition]] has been challenged by the rapid growth and sophistication of the National Competition Authorities (NCAs) and by increased criticism from the European courts with respect to procedure, interpretation and economic analysis.&lt;ref&gt;See Wallace &amp; Pollack&lt;/ref&gt; These problems have been magnified by the increasingly unmanageable workload of the centralised corporate notification system. A further reason why a reform of the old Regulation 17/62 was needed, was the looming enlargement of the EU, by which its membership was to expand to [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|25 by 2004]] and [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|27 by 2007]]. Given the still developing nature of the [[Transition economy|east-central European new market economies]], the already inundated Commission anticipated a further significant increase in its workload.

To all these challenges, the Commission has responded with a strategy to decentralise the implementation of the Competition rules through the so-called [[Modernisation Regulation]]. EU Council Regulation 1/2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R0001:EN:NOT |title=Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty |publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; places National Competition Authorities and Member State national courts at the heart of the enforcement of Arts 101 &amp; 102. Decentralised enforcement has for long been the usual way for other EC rules, Reg 1/2003 finally extended this to Competition Law as well. The Commission still retained an important role in the enforcement mechanism, as the co-ordinating force in the newly created [[European Competition Network]] (ECN). This Network, made up of the national bodies plus the Commission, manages the flow of information between NCAs and maintains the coherence and integrity of the system. At the time, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti hailed this regulation as one that will 'revolutionise' the enforcement of Arts 101 &amp; 102. Since May 2004, all NCAs and national courts are empowered to fully apply the Competition provisions of the EC Treaty. In its 2005 report, the [[OECD]] lauded the modernisation effort as promising, and noted that decentralisation helps to redirect resources so the DG Competition can concentrate on complex, Community-wide investigations. Yet most recent developments shed doubt on the efficacy of the new arrangements. For instance, on 20 December 2006, the Commission publicly backed down from 'unbundling' French (EdF) and German ([[E.ON]]) energy giants, facing tough opposition from Member State governments. Another legal battle is currently ongoing over the E.ON-Endesa merger, where the Commission has been trying to enforce the free movement of capital, while Spain firmly protects its perceived national interests. It remains to be seen whether NCAs will be willing to challenge their own national 'champion companies' under EC Competition Law, or whether patriotic feelings prevail.

==Mergers and monopolisation==
{{main article|TFEU article 102}}

===Scope of competition law===

Because the logic of competition is most appropriate for private enterprise, the core of EU competition regulation targets profit making corporations. This said, regulation necessarily extends further and in the [[TFEU]], both articles 101 and 102 use the ambiguous concept of "undertaking" to delimit competition law's reach. This uncomfortable English word, which is essentially a literal translation of the German word "Unternehmen", was discussed in ''[[Höfner and Elser v Macrotron GmbH]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[1991] ECR I-1979 ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61990J0041:EN:NOT C-41/90])&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Court of Justice]] described "undertaking" to mean any person (natural or legal) "engaged in an economic activity", which potentially included state run enterprises in cases where they pursued economic activities like a private business. This included a state run employment agency, where it attempted to make money but was not in a position to meet demand. By contrast, in ''[[FENIN v Commission]]'', public services which were run on the basis of "solidarity" for a "social purpose" were said to be outside the scope of competition law.&lt;ref&gt;[2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Self-employed people, who are in business on their own account, will be classed as undertakings, but employees are wholly excluded. Following the same principle that was laid down by the US [[Clayton Act 1914]], they are by their "very nature the opposite of the independent exercise of an economic or commercial activity".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Albany International BV]]'' (1999) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61996C0067:EN:NOT], per AG Jacobs&lt;/ref&gt; This means that trade unions cannot be regarded as subject to competition law, because their central objective is to remedy the [[inequality of bargaining power]] that exists in dealing with employers who are generally organised in a corporate form.

===Mergers and acquisitions===
{{Clist mergers}}
{{main article|European Union merger law}}
Under the authority of Article 102 TFEU, the European Commission became able not only to regulate the behaviour of large firms it claims abuse their dominant positions or [[market power]], but also the possibility of firms gaining the position within the [[market structure]] that enables them to behave abusively in the first place. The [[Merger Regulation]] (EC) No 139/2004 deals with mergers that have a "Community dimension" and lays out a procedure whereby all "concentrations" (i.e. mergers, acquisitions, takeovers) between undertakings are subject to approval by the European Commission.

A merger or acquisition involves, from a competition law perspective, the concentration of economic power in the hands of fewer than before. In the European Union, under the Merger Regulation 139/2004. This is known as the "ECMR", and the authority for the Commission to pass this regulation is found under Art. 103 TFEU. Competition law requires that firms proposing to merge gain authorisation from the relevant government authority, or simply go ahead but face the prospect of [[demerger]] should the concentration later be found to lessen competition.

The central provision under EU law asks whether a concentration ''would'' if it went ahead "significantly impede effective competition... in particular as a result of the creation or strengthening of a dominant position..."&lt;ref&gt;Art. 2(3) Reg. 129/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Under article 3(1), a concentration means a "change of control on a lasting basis results from (a) the merger of two or more previously independent undertakings... (b) the acquisition... if direct or indirect control of the whole or parts of one or more other undertakings."&lt;ref&gt;[[Merger Regulation]] (EC) No 139/2004, art 3(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

This usually means that one firm buys out the [[share (finance)|share]]s of another. The reasons for oversight of economic concentrations by the state are the same as the reasons to restrict firms who abuse a position of dominance, only that regulation of mergers and acquisitions attempts to deal with the problem before it arises, ''ex ante'' prevention of creating dominant firms. In the case of ''[[Gencor Ltd v Commission]]''&lt;ref&gt;(1999) T-102/96, [1999] ECR II-753&lt;/ref&gt; the EU [[Court of First Instance]] wrote merger control is there "...to avoid the establishment of market structures which may create or strengthen a dominant position and not need to control directly possible abuses of dominant positions."

What amounts to a substantial lessening of, or significant impediment to competition is usually answered through empirical study. The market shares of the merging companies can be assessed and added, although this kind of analysis only gives rise to presumptions, not conclusions.&lt;ref&gt;see, for instance para 17, ''Guidelines on the assessment of horizontal mergers'' (2004/C 31/03)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Herfindahl index|Herfindahl-Hirschman Index]] is used to calculate the "density" of the market, or what concentration exists. Aside from the maths, it is important to consider the product in question and the rate of technical innovation in the market.&lt;ref&gt;''[[France v Commission]]'' (1998) C-68/94, [1998] ECR I-1375, para. 219&lt;/ref&gt; A further problem of collective dominance, or [[oligopoly]] through "economic links"&lt;ref&gt;''Italian Flat Glass'' [1992] ECR ii-1403&lt;/ref&gt; can arise, whereby the new market becomes more conducive to [[collusion]]. It is relevant how transparent a market is, because a more concentrated structure could mean firms can co-ordinate their behaviour more easily, whether firms can deploy deterrents and whether firms are safe from a reaction by their competitors and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Airtours plc v Commission]]'' (2002) T-342/99, [2002] ECR II-2585, para 62&lt;/ref&gt; The entry of new firms to the market, and any barriers that they might encounter should be considered.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mannesmann, Vallourec and Ilva]]'' [1994] CMLR 529, OJ L102 21 April 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain exceptions exist, by which a firm whose conduct may be ''prima facie'' anti-competitive can be sanctioned under the reference to "technical and economic progress" in Art. 2 of the ECMR.&lt;ref&gt;see the argument put forth in Hovenkamp H (1999) ''Federal Antitrust Policy: The Law of Competition and Its Practice'', 2nd Ed, West Group, St. Paul, Minnesota. Unlike the authorities however, the courts take a dim view of the efficiencies defence.&lt;/ref&gt; Another defence might be that a firm being taken over is about to fail or go insolvent, and taking it over does not diminish the competitive state any more than what would happen anyway.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Kali und Salz AG v Commission]]'' [1975] ECR 499&lt;/ref&gt; Mergers vertically in the market are rarely of concern, although in ''AOL/Time Warner''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time Warner/AOL]]'' [2002] 4 CMLR 454, OJ L268&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Commission]] required that a joint venture with a competitor [[Bertelsmann]] be ceased beforehand. The EU authorities have also focussed lately on the effect of [[conglomerate merger]]s, where companies acquire a large portfolio of related products, though without necessarily dominant shares in any individual market.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''[[Guinness/Grand Metropolitan]]'' [1997] 5 CMLR 760, OJ L288; Many in the US are scathing of this approach, see W. J. Kolasky, ‘Conglomerate Mergers and Range Effects: It's a long way from Chicago to Brussels’ 9 November 2001, Address before George Mason University Symposium Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

*2001, July. The European Commission prohibits a merger of [[General Electric]] and [[Honeywell]].
*2004, December. The European Commission prohibits a merger of [[Energias de Portugal SA]] and [[Gas de Portugal SA]].
*2004, March. The European Commission forces [[Microsoft]] to offer a [[Microsoft Windows]] version without the [[Windows Media Player]] preinstalled within the [[European Union]]. See: [[European Union Microsoft antitrust case]].
*2006, July. The Court of First Instance annuls the Commission's clearance decision of the merger of [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and [[Bertelsmann Music Group]] to form [[Sony BMG]] forcing the Commission to re-assess the merger.

===Abuse of dominance===
{{Clist dominance}}
Article 102 is aimed at preventing undertakings that have a dominant market position from abusing that position to the detriment of consumers. It provides that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the common market or in a substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market insofar as it may affect trade between Member States.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This can mean,
&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions; 
(b) limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers;

(c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage; 
(d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The provision aims to protect competition and promote consumer welfare by preventing firms from abusing dominant market positions. This objective has been emphasised by EU institutions and officials on numerous occasions – for example, it was stated as such during the judgement in ''Deutsche Telekom v Commission'',&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Case C-280/08 P Deutsche Telekom v Commission [2010] ECR I-9555&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the former Commissioner for Competition, Neelie Kroes, also specified in 2005 that: “First, it is competition, and not competitors, that is to be protected. Second, ultimately the aim is to avoid consumer harm”.&lt;ref&gt;SPEECH/05/537, 23 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the European Commission published its ''Guidance on Article [102] Enforcement Priorities'', &lt;ref&gt; Guidance on the Commission’s enforcement priorities in applying Article 82 TFEU to abusive exclusionary conduct by dominant undertakings OJ [2009] C 45/7&lt;/ref&gt; which details the body's aims when applying Article 102, reiterating that the ultimate goal is the protection of the competitive process and the concomitant consumer benefits that are derived from it.&lt;ref&gt; Ibid. paras. [5-6]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding these stated objectives, Article 102 is quite controversial and has been much scrutinised.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber, David J., The Future of Article 82: Dissecting the Conflict (August 2007). European Competition Law Annual 2007: A Reformed Approach to Article 82 EC (Claus-Dieter Ehlermann and Mel Marquis eds.), 2008; Chicago-Kent College of Law Research Paper. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2159343&lt;/ref&gt; In large part, this stems from the fact that the provision applies only where dominance is present; meaning a firm that is not in a dominant market position could legitimately pursue competitive practices – such as bundling – that would otherwise constitute abuse if committed by a dominant firm. That is not to suggest that it is unlawful for a firm to hold a dominant position; rather, it is the ''abuse'' of that position that is the concern of Article 102 – as was stated in ''Michelin v Commission''&lt;ref&gt;Case 322/81 Michelin v Commission [1983] ECR 3461&lt;/ref&gt; a dominant firm has a: “special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair undistorted competition”.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid, para. [57]&lt;/ref&gt;

In applying Article 102, the Commission must consider two points. Firstly, it is necessary to show that an undertaking holds a dominant position in the relevant market and, secondly, there must be an analysis of the undertaking's behaviour to ascertain whether it is abusive. Determining dominance is often a question of whether a firm behaves "to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors, customers and ultimately of its consumer."&lt;ref&gt;''[[United Brands Company v Commission of the European Communities|United Brands v Commission]]'' (1978) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61976J0027:EN:NOT C-27/76], [1978] ECR 207&lt;/ref&gt; Under EU law, very large market shares raise a presumption that a firm is dominant,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co AG v Commission]]''(1979) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61976J0085:EN:NOT C-85/76], [1979] ECR 461&lt;/ref&gt; which may be rebuttable.&lt;ref&gt;''[[AKZO]]'' (1991) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61986J0062:EN:NOT ]&lt;/ref&gt; If a firm has a dominant position, because it has beyond a 39.7% market share&lt;ref&gt;This was the lowest yet market share of a "dominant" firm, in ''[[BA/Virgin]]'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt; then there is "a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair competition on the common market"&lt;ref&gt;''[[Michelin]]'' [1983]&lt;/ref&gt; Same as with collusive conduct, market shares are determined with reference to the particular market in which the firm and product in question is sold.

With regard to abuse, it is possible to identify three different forms that the EU Commission and Courts have recognised.&lt;ref&gt; Whish, R. and Bailey, D. (2015). Competition law. Oxford: Oxford University Press, pp. 212-213&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, there are ''exploitative'' abuses, whereby a dominant firm abuses its market position to exploit consumers – for example by reducing output and increasing the price of its goods or services.&lt;ref&gt;Gal, Michal S., Abuse of Dominance - Exploitative Abuses (March 10, 2015). in HANDBOOK ON EUROPEAN COMPETITION LAW (Lianos and Geradin eds., Edward Elgar, 2013), Chapter 9, pp. 385-422 . Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2576042&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, there are ''exclusionary'' abuses, involving behaviour by a dominant firm which is aimed at, or has the effect of, preventing the development of competition by excluding competitors.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Alison and Lovdahl Gormsen, Liza, Abuse of Dominance: Exclusionary Pricing Abuses (January 1, 2013). I Lianos and D Geradin, Handbook on European Competition Law: Substantive Aspects (Edward Elgar, 2013). Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2395165&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, there exists a possible third category of ''single market'' abuse, which concerns behaviour that is harmful to the principles of the single market more broadly, such as the impeding of parallel imports or limiting of intra-brand competition.&lt;ref&gt;Case 226/84 British Leyland v Commission [1986] ECR 3263&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is no rigid demarcation between these three types, Article 102 has most frequently been applied to forms of conduct falling under the heading of exclusionary abuse. Generally, this is because exploitative abuses are perceived to be less invidious than exclusionary abuses because the former can easily be remedied by competitors provided there are no barriers to market entry, whilst the latter require more authoritative intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Lang. J – ‘How Can the Problems of Exclusionary Abuses under Article 102 TFEU be Resolved?’ [2012] 37 E.L. Rev. 136-155&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the Commission's ''Guidance'' explicitly recognises the distinction between the different types of abusive conduct and states that the Guidance is limited to examples of exclusionary abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Guidance para. [7]&lt;/ref&gt; As such, much of the jurisprudence of Article 102 concerns behaviour which can be categorised as exclusionary.

The Article does not contain an explicit definition of what amounts to abusive conduct and the courts have made clear that the types of abusive conduct in which a dominant firm may engage is not closed.&lt;ref&gt;Case 6/72 Continental Can v Commission [1973] ECR 215&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible to discern a general meaning of the term from the jurisprudence of the EU courts. In ''Hoffman-La Roche'',&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Case 85/76 Hoffman-La Roche v Commission [1979] ECR 461&lt;/ref&gt; it was specified that dominant firms must refrain from ‘methods different from those which condition normal competition’.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid. at para [91]&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of ‘normal’ competition has developed into the idea of ‘competition on the merits’,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; which states that competitive practices leading to the marginalisation of inefficient competitors will be permissible so long as it is within the realm of normal, or on the merit, competitive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Case C-209/10 Post Danmark EU:C: 2012:172, at para. [22]&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission provides examples of normal, positive, competitive behaviour as offering lower prices, better quality products and a wider choice of new and improved goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Guidance para. [5]&lt;/ref&gt; From this, it can be inferred that behaviour that is abnormal – or not ‘on the merits’ – and therefore amounting to abuse, includes such infractions as margin squeezing, refusals to supply and the misleading of patent authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, D. and Whish, R. (2015). Competition law (8th Edition). Oxford University Press, pp. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of the types of conduct held by the EU Courts to constitute abuse include:
* Exclusive dealing agreements&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
Whereby a customer is required to purchase all or most of a particular type of good or service from a dominant supplier and is prevented from buying from others.
* Granting of exclusivity rebates&lt;ref&gt;Case T-286/09 Intel v Commission EU:T:2014:547&lt;/ref&gt;
Purported loyalty schemes that are equivalent in effect to exclusive dealing agreements.
* Tying&lt;ref&gt;Case T-201/04 Microsoft Corpn v Commission [2007] ECR II-3601&lt;/ref&gt;
Tying one product to the sale of another, thereby restricting consumer choice.
* Bundling&lt;ref&gt;De Poste-La Poste OJ [2002] L 61/32&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar to tying, whereby a supplier will only supply its products in a bundle with one or more other products.
* Margin squeezing&lt;ref&gt; Case C-280/08 P Deutsche Telekom v Commission [2010] ECR I-9555&lt;/ref&gt;
Vertical practices that have the effect of excluding downstream competitors.
* Refusing to license intellectual property rights&lt;ref&gt; Case 24/67 Parke, Davis &amp; Co v Probel [1968] ECR 55&lt;/ref&gt;
Whereby a dominant firm holding patented rights refuses to licence those rights to others.
* Refusal to supply&lt;ref&gt; Case 6/73 Commercial Solvents v Commission [1974] ECR 223&lt;/ref&gt;
Refusing to supply a competitor with a good or service, often in a bid to drive them out of the market.
* Predatory pricing&lt;ref&gt; Case T-340/03 France Telecom SA v Commission (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;
Where a dominant firm deliberately reduces prices to loss-making levels in order to force competitors out of the market. 
* Price discrimination&lt;ref&gt; Case T-288/97 Irish Sugar plc v Commission [1999]&lt;/ref&gt;
Arbitrarily charging some market participants higher prices that are unconnected to the actual costs of supplying the goods or services.

Whilst there are no statutory defences under Article 102, the Court of Justice has stressed that a dominant firm may seek to justify behaviour that would otherwise constitute abuse, either by arguing that the behaviour is objectively justifiable or by showing that any resulting negative consequences are outweighed by the greater efficiencies it promotes.&lt;ref&gt;Case C-209/10 Post Danmark v Commission EU:C:2012:172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friederiszick, Hans Wolfgang and Gratz, Linda, Dominant and Efficient – On the Relevance of Efficiencies in Abuse of Dominance Cases (December 19, 2012). ESMT White Paper No. WP-12-01. Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=2191492 pp.23-30&lt;/ref&gt;
In order for behaviour to be objectively justifiable, the conduct in question must be proportionate&lt;ref&gt;Loewenthal ‘The Defence of “Objective Justification” in the Application of Article 82 EC’ (2005) 28 World Competition 455&lt;/ref&gt; and would have to be based on factors external to the dominant undertaking's control&lt;ref&gt;Guidance, para [29]&lt;/ref&gt; – such as health or safety considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Case T-30/89 Hilti AG v Commission [1991] ECR II-1439&lt;/ref&gt; To substantiate a claim on efficiency grounds, the Commission's ''Guidance'' states that four cumulative conditions must be satisfied:&lt;ref&gt;Guidance, para [30]&lt;/ref&gt;
# The efficiencies would have to be realised, or be likely to be realised, as a result of the conduct;
# The conduct would have to be indispensable to the realisation of those efficiencies;
# The efficiencies would have to outweigh any negative effects on competition and consumer welfare; And
# The conduct must not eliminate all effective competition.
If an abuse of dominance is established, the Commission has the power, pursuant to Article 23 of Regulation 1/2003,&lt;ref&gt;OJ [2003] L 1/1&lt;/ref&gt; to impose a fine and to order the dominant undertaking to cease and desist from the unlawful conduct in question. Additionally, though yet to be imposed, Article 7 of Regulation 1/2003&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; permits the Commission, where proportionate and necessary, to order the divestiture of an undertaking's assets.

==Cartels and collusion==
{{main article|TFEU article 101}}
Possibly the least contentious function of competition law is to control [[cartels]] among private businesses. Any "undertaking" is regulated, and this concept embraces ''de facto'' economic units, or enterprises, regardless of whether they are a single corporation, or a group of multiple companies linked through ownership or contract.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Viho BV v Commission]]'' (1995) Case C-73/95, [1995] ECR I-5457&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cartels===
{{Clist collusion}}
{{see also|Cartel|Sherman Act 1890}}
To violate [[TFEU]] article 101, undertakings must then have formed an agreement, developed a "concerted practice", or, within an association, taken a decision. Like [[US antitrust]], this just means all the same thing;&lt;ref&gt;''Van Landewyck'' (1980) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61978C0209:EN:NOT], per AG Reischl, there is no need to distinguish an agreement from a concerted practice, because they are merely convenient labels&lt;/ref&gt; any kind of dealing or contact, or a "meeting of the minds" between parties. Covered therefore is a whole range of behaviour from a strong handshaken, written or verbal agreement to a supplier sending invoices with directions not to export to its retailer who gives "tacit acquiescence" to the conduct.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sandoz Prodotti Farmaceutica SpA v Commission]]'' (1990) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:61987J0277:EN:NOT]&lt;/ref&gt; Article 101(1) prohibits,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"All agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between member states and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This includes both horizontal (e.g. between retailers) and vertical (e.g. between retailers and suppliers) agreements, effectively outlawing the operation of [[cartels]] within the EU. Article 101 has been construed very widely to include both informal agreements (gentlemen's agreements) and concerted practices where firms tend to raise or lower prices at the same time without having physically agreed to do so. However, a coincidental increase in prices will not in itself prove a concerted practice, there must also be evidence that the parties involved were aware that their behaviour may prejudice the normal operation of the competition within the common market. This latter subjective requirement of knowledge is not, in principle, necessary in respect of agreements. As far as agreements are concerned the mere anticompetitive effect is sufficient to make it illegal even if the parties were unaware of it or did not intend such effect to take place.

===Exemptions===
Exemptions to Article 101 behaviour fall into three categories. Firstly, Article 101(3) creates an exemption for practices beneficial to consumers, e.g., by facilitating technological advances, but without restricting all competition in the area. In practice the Commission gave very few official exemptions and a new system for dealing with them is currently under review. Secondly, the Commission agreed to exempt 'Agreements of minor importance' (except those fixing sale prices) from Article 101. This exemption applies to small companies, together holding no more than 10% of the relevant market. In this situation as with Article 102 (see below), market definition is a crucial, but often highly difficult, matter to resolve. Thirdly, the Commission has also introduced a collection of block exemptions for different contract types. These include a list of contract permitted terms and a list of banned terms in these exemptions.

===European enforcement===
{{see also|European Commission|Enforcement of European competition law}}
The task of tracking down and punishing those in breach of competition law has been entrusted to the European Commission, which receives its powers under Article 105 TFEU. Under this Article, the European Commission is charged with the duty of ensuring the application of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU and of investigating suspected infringements of these Articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paul Craig and Gráinne de Burca|title=EU LAW, Tect, Cases and Materials|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1064}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission and national competition authorities have wide on-site investigation powers. Article 105 TFEU grants extensive investigative powers including the notorious power to carry out dawn raids on the premises of suspected undertakings and private homes and vehicles.

There are many ways in which the European Commission could become aware of a potential violation: 
The European Commission may carry out investigation or inspections, for which it is empowered to request information from governments, competent authorities of Member States, and undertakings. The Commission also provides a ''leniency policy'', under which companies that whistle blow over the anti-competition policies of cartels are treated leniently and may obtain either total immunity or a reduction in fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/cartels/leniency/leniency.html|title=About the cartel leniency policy - European Commission|website=ec.europa.eu|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, parties have sought to resist the taking of certain documents during an inspection based on the argument that those documents are covered by legal professional privilege between lawyer and client. The ECJ held that such a privilege was recognised by EC law to a limited extent at least.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=''[[Australian Mining and Smelting Europe Ltd v Commission]]'', ECR 1575|year=1982|volume=Case 155/79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Commission also could become aware of a potential competition violation through the complaint from an aggrieved party. In addition, Member States and any natural or legal person are entitled to make a complaint if they have a legitimate interest.

Article 101 (2) TFEU considers any undertaking found in breach of Article 101 TFEU to be null and void and that agreements cannot be legally enforced. In addition, the European Commission may impose a fine pursuant to Article 23 of Regulation 1/2003. These fines are not fixed and can extend into millions of Euros, up to a maximum of 10% of the total worldwide turnover of each of the undertakings participating in the infringement, although there may be a decrease in case of cooperation and increase in case of recidivism. Fines of up to 5% of the average daily turnover may also be levied for every day an undertaking fails to comply with Commission requirements. The gravity and duration of the infringement are to be taken into account in determining the amount of the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paul Craig and Gráinne de Burca|title=EU LAW, Text, Cases and Materials|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1074}}&lt;/ref&gt; This uncertainty acts as a powerful deterrent and ensures that companies are unable to undertake a cost/benefit analysis before breaching competition law.&lt;br /&gt;
 
The Commission guideline on the method of setting fines imposed pursuant to Article 23 (2) (a) of Regulation 1/2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines on the method of setting fines imposed pursuant to Article 23(2)(a) of Regulation No 1/2003|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2006:210:0002:0005:EN:PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  uses a two-step methodology:

* The Commission first defines a basic amount of the fine for each involved undertaking or association of undertakings; and then
* Adjusts the basic amount according to the individual circumstances upwards or downwards.

The basic amount relates, inter alia, to the proportion of the value of the sales depending on the degree of the gravity of the infringement. In this regard, Article 5 of the aforementioned guideline states, that
:"To achieve these objectives, it is appropriate for the Commission to refer to the value of the sales of goods or services to which the infringement relates as a basis for setting the fine. The duration of the infringement should also play a significant role in the setting of the fine. It necessarily affects the potential consequences of the infringements on the market. It is therefore considered important that the fine should also reflect the number of years during which an undertaking participated in the infringement."

In a second step, this basic amount may be adjusted on grounds of recidivism or leniency. In the latter case, immunity from fines may be granted to the company who submits evidence first to the European Commission which enables it to carry out an investigation and/or to find an infringement of Article 101 TFEU.

The highest cartel fine which was ever imposed was related to a cartel consisting of four car glass producers. The companies Asahi, Pilkington, Saint-Gobain and Soliver were fined over €1.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Illegal car glass cartel receives record fines |url=http://ec.europa.eu/unitedkingdom/press/frontpage/12a112008_en.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1998 and early 2003 those companies had discussed target prices, market sharing and customer allocation in a series of meetings and other illicit contacts. In this case, the European Commission started its investigation based on an anonymous "tip".

Another negative consequence for the companies involved in cartel cases may be the adverse publicity which may damage the company's reputation.

Questions of reform have circulated around whether to introduce US style treble damages as added deterrent against competition law violaters. The recent Modernisation Regulation 1/2003 has meant that the European Commission no longer has a monopoly on enforcement, and that private parties may bring suits in national courts. Hence, there has been debate over the legitimacy of private damages actions in traditions that shy from imposing punitive measures in civil actions.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

According to the Court of Justice of the European Union, any citizen or business who suffers harm as a result of a breach of the European Union competition rules (Articles 101 and 102 TFEU) should be able to obtain reparation from the party who caused the harm. However, despite this requirement under European law to establish an effective legal framework enabling victims to exercise their right to compensation, victims of European Union competition law infringements to date very often do not obtain reparation for the harm suffered. The amount of compensation that these victims are foregoing is in the range of several billion Euros a year. Therefore, the European Commission has taken a number steps since 2004 to stimulate the debate on that topic and elicit feedback from stakeholders on a number of possible options which could facilitate antitrust damages actions. Based on the outcomes of several public consultations, the Commission has suggested specific policy choices and measures in a White Paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actions for damages|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/actionsdamages/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the European Parliament and European Council issued a joint directive on 'certain rules governing actions for damages under national law for infringements of the competition law provisions of the Members States and of the European Union'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Antitrust Damages Directive 2014/104/EU|url=https://www.carteldamageclaims.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/EU-Damages-Directive-2014_104_EU.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

;Sector inquiry
A special instrument of the European Commission is the so-called sector inquiry in accordance with Art. 17 of Regulation 1/2003.&lt;br /&gt;
 
Article 17 (1) first paragraph of Council Regulation 1/2003 reads:
:"Where the trend of trade between Member States, the rigidity of prices or other circumstances suggest that competition may be restricted or distorted within the common market, the Commission may conduct its inquiry into a particular sector of the economy or into a particular type of agreements across various sectors. In the course of that inquiry, the Commission may request the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned to supply information necessary for giving effect to Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty (now Art. 101 and 102 TFEU) and may carry out any inspections necessary for that purpose."

In case of sector inquiries, the European Commission follows its reasonable suspicion that the competition in a particular industry sector or solely related to a certain type of contract which is used in various industry sectors is prevented, restricted or distorted within the common market. Thus, in this case not a specific violation is investigated. Nevertheless, the European Commission has almost all avenues of investigation at its disposal, which it may use to investigate and track down violations of competition law. The European Commission may decide to start a sector inquiry when a market does not seem to be working as well as it should. This might be suggested by evidence such as limited trade between Member States, lack of new entrants on the market, the rigidity of prices, or other circumstances suggest that competition may be restricted or distorted within the common market. In the course of the inquiry, the Commission may request that firms - undertakings or associations of undertakings - concerned supply information (for example, price information). This information is used by the European Commission to assess whether it needs to open specific investigations into intervene to ensure the respect of EU rules on restrictive agreements and abuse of dominant position (Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).

There has been an increased use of this tool in the recent years, as it is not possible any more for companies to register a cartel or agreement which might be in breach of competition law with the European Commission, but the companies are responsible themselves for assessing whether their agreements constitute a violation of European Union Competition Law (self assessment).

Traditionally, agreements had, subject to certain exceptions, to be notified to the European Commission, and the Commission had a monopoly over the application of Article 101 TFEU (former Article 81 (3) EG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paul Craig and Gráinne de Burca|title=EU LAW, Text, Cases and Materials|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=1063}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the European Commission did not have the resources to deal with all the agreements notified, notification was abolished.&lt;br /&gt;
 
One of the most spectacular sector inquiry was the pharmaceutical sector inquiry which took place in 2008 and 2009 in which the European Commission used dawn raids from the beginning. The European Commission launched a sector inquiry into EU pharmaceuticals markets under the European Competition rules because information relating to innovative and generic medicines suggested that competition may be restricted or distorted. The inquiry related to the period 2000 to 2007 and involved investigation of a sample of 219 medicines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry Preliminary Report (DG Competition Staff Working Paper) |url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/pharmaceuticals/inquiry/preliminary_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Taking into account that sector inquiries are a tool under European Competition law, the inquiry's main focus was company behaviour. The inquiry therefore concentrated on those practices which companies may use to block or delay generic competition as well as to block or delay the development of competing originator drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Communication from the Commission - Executive Summary of the Pharmaceutical Sector Inquiry Report |url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/pharmaceuticals/inquiry/communication_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following sectors have also been subject of a sector inquiry:

* Financial Services

;Leniency policy
The leniency policy&lt;ref&gt;see DGCOMP's page on [http://ec.europa.eu/competition/cartels/legislation/leniency_legislation.html Leniency legislation (immunity from fines and reduction of fines in cartel cases)]&lt;/ref&gt; consists in abstaining from prosecuting firms that, being party to a cartel, inform the [[European Commission|Commission]] of its existence. The leniency policy was first applied in 2002.

The ''Commission Notice on Immunity from fines and reduction of fines in cartel cases''&lt;ref&gt;see, [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52006XC1208(04):EN:NOT Commission Notice on Immunity from fines and reduction of fines in cartel cases]&lt;/ref&gt; guarantees [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]] and penalty reductions to firms who co-operate with the Commission in detecting cartels.

&lt;blockquote&gt;II.A, §8:&lt;br/&gt;The Commission will ''grant immunity'' from any fine which would otherwise have been imposed to an ''undertaking disclosing its participation in an alleged cartel'' affecting the Community if that undertaking is the '''first to submit information''' and evidence which in the Commission's view will enable it to:&lt;br/&gt;
(a) carry out a targeted inspection in connection with the alleged cartel; or&lt;br/&gt;
(b) find an infringement of Article 81 EC in connection with the alleged cartel.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The mechanism is straightforward. The first firm to acknowledge their crime and inform the Commission will receive complete immunity, that is, no fine will be applied. Co-operation with the Commission will also be gratified with reductions in the fines, in the following way:&lt;ref&gt;see, DGCOMP's [http://ec.europa.eu/competition/cartels/leniency/leniency.html European Commission &gt; Competition &gt; Cartels &gt; Leniency]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The first firm to denounce existence of a [[cartel]] receives [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] from prosecution.
*If the firm is not the first to denounce its existence, it gets a 50% reduction in fines.
*If the firm co-operates with the Commission, acknowledging its culpability, it gets a 10% reduction in fines.
*If, once the investigation is opened, the firm gives additional information, it gets a 20-30% reduction in fines.

This policy has been of great success as it has increased cartel detection to such an extent that nowadays most cartel investigations are started according to the leniency policy. The purpose of a sliding scale in fine reductions is to encourage a "race to confess" among cartel members. In cross border or international investigations, cartel members are often at pains to inform not only the EU Commission, but also National Competition Authorities (e.g. the [[Office of Fair Trading]] and the ''[[Bundeskartellamt]]'') and authorities across the globe.

===National authorities===
;United Kingdom
{{main article|Office of Fair Trading|Competition Commission}}
Following the introduction of the Enterprise Act 2002 the Office of Fair Trading&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/ |title=Office of Fair Trading |publisher=Oft.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was responsible for enforcing competition law (enshrined in The Competition Act 1998) in the UK. These powers are shared with concurrent sectoral regulators such as Ofgem in energy, Ofcom in telecoms, the ORR in rail and Ofwat in water. The OFT was replaced by the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] (CMA), established on 1 April 2014, combining many of the functions of the OFT and the Competition Commission (CC).

It was first established in 1958 and comes under the authority of the Federal Ministry of the Economy and Technology. Its headquarters are in the former West German capital, Bonn and its president is Andreas Mundt, who has a staff of 300 people. Today it administers [[competition law]] in Germany, and is one of the leading national competition authorities in Europe.

The ''Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato'' in Italy was established in 1990.

;Poland
{{main article|Office of Competition and Consumer Protection}}
The Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) was established in 1990 as the Antimonopoly Office. In 1989, on the verge of a political breakthrough, when the economy was based on the free market mechanisms, an Act on counteracting monopolistic practices was passed on 24 February 1990. It constituted an important element of the market reform programme. The structure of the economy, inherited from the central planning system, was characterised with a high level of monopolisation, which could significantly limit the success of the economic transformation. In this situation, promotion of competition and counteracting the anti-market behaviours of the monopolists was especially significant. Therefore, the Antimonopoly Office - AO (Urząd Antymonopolowy - UA) was appointed under this act, and commenced its operation in May once the Council of Ministers passed the charter. Also its first regional offices commenced operations in that very same year.

Right now the Office works under the name Office of Competition and Consumer Protection and bases its activities on the newly enacted Act on the Protection of Competition and Consumers from 2007.

===International cooperation===
{{See also|World Trade Organization|International Competition Network}}
[[File:WTO members and observers.svg|right|thumb|There is considerable controversy among [[World Trade Organization|WTO]] members, in green, whether competition law should form part of the agreements]]
Chapter 5 of the post war [[Havana Charter]] contained an Antitrust code&lt;ref&gt;see a speech by Wood, ''The Internationalisation of Antitrust Law: Options for the Future'' 3 February 1995, at http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/public/speeches/future.txt&lt;/ref&gt; but this was never incorporated into the WTO's forerunner, the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] 1947. [[Office of Fair Trading]] Director and Professor Richard Whish wrote sceptically that it "seems unlikely at the current stage of its development that the WTO will metamorphose into a global competition authority."&lt;ref&gt;Whish (2003) p. 448&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, at the ongoing [[Doha round]] of trade talks for the [[World Trade Organization]], discussion includes the prospect of competition law enforcement moving up to a global level. While it is incapable of enforcement itself, the newly established [[International Competition Network]]&lt;ref&gt;see, http://www.internationalcompetitionnetwork.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (ICN) is a way for national authorities to coordinate their own enforcement activities.

==State policy==

===Public services===
{{see also|Public economics|UK public service law|US public service law}}
Article 106(2) of the TFEU states that nothing in the rules can be used to obstruct a member state's right to deliver public services, but that otherwise public enterprises must play by the same rules on collusion and abuse of dominance as everyone else.

Services of general economic interest is more technical term for what are commonly called [[public services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-17570-2_8|title=Neue Wohnungsgemeinnützigkeit|last=Kuhnert|first=Jan|last2=Leps|first2=Olof|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden|isbn=9783658175696|pages=213–258|language=de|doi=10.1007/978-3-658-17570-2_8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement under the European Treaties was meant to preserve Europe's social character and institutions. Article 86 refers first of all to "undertakings", which has been defined to restrict the scope of competition law's application. In ''[[Cisal]]''&lt;ref&gt;C-218/00 ''[[Cisal di Battistello Venanzio and C. Sas v Instituto nazionale per l'assicurazione contro gli infortuni sul lavoro]]'' (''[[INAIL]]'') [2002] ECR I-691, para 31-45&lt;/ref&gt; a managing director challenged the state's compulsory workplace accident and disease insurance scheme. This was run by a body known as "''[[Istituto nazionale per l'assicurazione contro gli infortuni sul lavoro|INAIL]]''". The ECJ held that the competition laws in this instance were not applicable. "Undertaking" was a term that should be reserved for entities that carried on some kind of economic activity. ''[[INAIL]]'' operated according to the principle of [[wikt:solidarity|solidarity]], because for example, contributions from high paid workers subsidise the low paid workers.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cisal]]'', para 42&lt;/ref&gt; Their activities therefore fall outside competition law's scope.

The substance of Article 106(2) also makes clear that competition law will be applied generally, but not where public services being provided might be obstructed. An example is shown in the ‘’Ambulanz Gloeckner’’ case.&lt;ref&gt;C-475/99 ''[[Ambulanz Gloeckner v Landkreis Suedwestpfalz]]'' [2001] ECR I-8089, para 52-65&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Rheinland Pfalz]], Germany, ambulances were provided exclusively by a company that also had the right to provide some non-emergency transport. The rationale was that ambulances were not profitable, not the other transport forms were, so the company was allowed to set profits of one sector off to the other, the alternative being higher taxation. The ECJ held that this was legitimate, clarfiying that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"the extension of the medical aid organisations’ exclusive rights to the non-emergency transport sector does indeed enable them to discharge their general-interest task of providing emergency transport in conditions of economic equilibrium. The possibility that would be open to private operators to concentrate, in the non-emergency sector, on more profitable journeys could affect the degree of economic viability of the service provided and, consequently, jeopardise the quality and reliability of that service."&lt;ref&gt;''Ambulanz Gloeckner'', para 61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ECJ did however insist that demand on the "subsidising" market must be met by the state's regime. In other words, the state is always under a duty to ensure efficient service. Political concern for the maintenance of a social European economy was expressed during the drafting of the [[Treaty of Amsterdam]], where a new Article 16 was inserted. This affirms, "the place occupied by services of general economic interest in the shared values of the Union as well as their role in promoting social and territorial cohesion." The ongoing debate is at what point the delicate line between the market and public services ought to be drawn.

EU Member states must not allow or assist businesses ("undertakings" in EU jargon) to infringe European Union competition law.&lt;ref&gt;see, C-311/85 ''[[Vereniging van Vlaamse Reisbureaus v ASBL Sociale Dienst van de Plaatselijke en Gewestelijke Overheidsdiensten]]'' [1987] ECR 3801, where a Belgian Royal decree incorporated a travel agent association code of conduct, which prohibited discounts (i.e. [[Price fixing|fixed prices]])&lt;/ref&gt; As the [[European Union]] is made up of independent [[Member state of the European Union|member states]], both competition policy and the creation of the European [[single market]] could be rendered ineffective were member states free to support national companies as they saw fit. A 2013 [[Civitas (think tank)|Civitas]] report lists some of the artifices used by participants to skirt the state aid rules on procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civitas.org.uk/economy/EUStateAidProcurement.pdf|title=civitias.org.uk: "Gamekeeper or poacher? Britain and the application of State aid and procurement policy in the European Union" (Garskarth) March 2013|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Companies affected by article 106 may be state owned or privately owned companies which are given special rights such as near or total monopoly to provide a certain service. The leading case in 1991, ''[[Régie des Télegraphes et des Téléphones v GB-Inno-BM]]'',&lt;ref&gt;C-18/88, [1991] ECR 5941&lt;/ref&gt; which involved a small telephone equipment maker, GB and the Belgian state telephone provider, RTT, which had the exclusive power to grant approved phones to connect to the telephone network. GB was selling its phones, which were unapproved by RTT, and at lower prices than RTT sold theirs. RTT sued them, demanding that GB inform customers that their phones were unapproved. GB argued that the special rights enjoyed by RTT under Belgian law infringed Article 86, and the case went to the [[European Court of Justice]] (ECJ). The ECJ held that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"To entrust to an undertaking which markets telephone equipment the task of drawing up specifications for such equipment, of monitoring their application and granting type-approval in respect thereof is tantamount to conferring on it the power to determine at will which equipment can be connected to the public network and thus gives it an obvious advantage over its competitors which is inimical to the equality of chances of traders, without which the existence of an undistorted system of competition cannot be guaranteed. Such a restriction on competition cannot be regarded as justified by a public service of general economic interest..."&lt;ref&gt;para 25, ''[[RTT v GB]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ECJ recommended that the Belgian government have an independent body to approve phone specifications,&lt;ref&gt;para 26&lt;/ref&gt; because it was wrong to have the state company both making phones and setting standards. RTT's market was opened to competition. An interesting aspect of the case was that the ECJ interpreted the effect of RTT's exclusive power as an "abuse" of its dominant position,&lt;ref&gt;paragraphs 23 and 24&lt;/ref&gt; so no abusive "action" as such by RTT needed to take place. The issue was further considered in ''[[Albany International]]''&lt;ref&gt;C-67/96 ''[[Albany International BV v Stichting Bedrijfspensioenfonds Textielindustrie]]'' [1999] ECR I-5751&lt;/ref&gt; Albany was a textile company, which found a cheap pension provider for its employees. It refused to pay contributions to the "Textile Trade Industry Fund", which the state had given the exclusive right to. Albany argued that the scheme was contrary to EU Competition law. The ECJ ruled that the scheme infringed then Article 86(1), as "undertakings are unable to entrust the management of such a pension scheme to a single insurer and the resulting restriction of competition derives directly from the exclusive right conferred on the sectoral pension fund."&lt;ref&gt;''Albany'' [1999] ECR I-5751, para 97&lt;/ref&gt; But the scheme was justified under then Article 86(2), being a service of general economic interest.

===Procurement===
{{main article|Government procurement in the European Union}}

===State aid===
{{see also|State aid}}
Article 107 TFEU, similar to Article 101 TFEU, lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition, but has the power to approve exceptions for specific projects addressing natural disasters or regional development. The general definition of State Aid is set out in Article 107(1) of the TFEU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF |title=Eur-lex.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Measures which fall within the definition of State Aid are unlawful unless provided under an exemption or notified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateaidlaw.com/index.php?q=what-is |title=A not-for-profit resource |publisher=State Aid Law |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For there to be State Aid under Article 107(1) of the TFEU each of the following must be present:
* There is the transfer of [[Member State]] resources;
* Which creates a selective advantage for one or more business undertakings;
* That has the potential to distort trade between in the relevant business market; and
* Affects trade between the Member States.

Where all of these criteria are met, State Aid is present and the support shall be unlawful unless provided under a European Commission exemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateaidlaw.com/index.php?q=present |title=A not-for-profit resource |publisher=State Aid Law |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[European Commission]] applies a number of exemptions which enable aid to be lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/legislation/legislation.html |title=European Commission - Competition |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Commission]] will also approve State Aid cases under the notification procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/state_aid/legislation/forms.html |title=European Commission - Competition |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the European Defense Agency deals with challenges to a "Level Playing Field for European Defence Industries: the Role of Ownership and Public Aid Practices"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eda.europa.eu/docs/documents/Level_Playing_Field_Study|title=eda.europa.eu: "Level Playing Field for European Defence Industries: the Role of Ownership and Public Aid Practices" (2009)|publisher=|accessdate=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State Aid law is an important issue for all public sector organisations and recipients of public sector support in the [[European Union]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateaidlaw.com/index.php?q=why |title=A not-for-profit resource |publisher=State Aid Law |date= |accessdate=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; because unlawful aid can be clawed back with compound interest.

There is some scepticism about the effectiveness of competition law in achieving economic progress and its interference with the provision of public services. France's former president [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] has called for the reference in the preamble to the [[Treaty of the European Union]] to the goal of "free and undistorted competition" to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;''Removal of competition clause causes dismay'', Tobias Buck and Bertrand Benoit, [[Financial Times]] p.6 June 23rd 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Though competition law itself would have remained unchanged, other goals of the preamble—which include "full employment" and "social progress"—carry the perception of greater specificity, and as being ends in themselves, while "free competition" is merely a means.

===Liberalisation===
{{see also|Liberalisation}}
The EU [[liberalisation]] programme entails a broadening of sector regulation, and extending [[competition law]] to previously state monopolised industries. The EU has also introduced positive integration measures to liberalise the internal market. There has at times been a tension between introduction of competition and the maintenance of universal and high quality service.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers (2006) p.1145&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Corbeau'' case,&lt;ref&gt;C-320/91 ''Corbeau'' [1993] ECR I-2533&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Corbeau had wanted to operate a rapid delivery service for post, which infringed the Belgian Regie des Postes' exclusive right to operate all services. The ECJ held the legislation would be contrary to Article 86 where it was excessive and unnecessary to guarantee the provision of services of general economic interest. It pointed out however that the postal regime (as was the case in most countries) allowed the post office to "offset less profitable sectors against the profitable sectors" of post operations. To provide universal service, a restriction of competition could be justified. The court went on to say,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"to authorise individual undertakings to compete with the holder of the exclusive rights in the sectors of their choice corresponding to those rights would make it possible for them to concentrate on the economically profitable operations and to offer more advantageous tariffs than those adopted by the holders of the exclusive rights since, unlike the latter, they are not bound for economic reasons to offset losses in the unprofitable sectors against profits in the more profitable sectors."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This meant a core of economic sectors in postal services could be reserved for financing the state industry. This was followed by the [[Postal Services Directive]] 97/67/EC,&lt;ref&gt;OJ L15/14, amended by Directive 2002/39/EC of 10 June 2003, OJ 2002 L176/21&lt;/ref&gt; which required Member States to "ensure that users enjoy the right to a universal service involving the permanent provision of a postal service... at all points in their territory."&lt;ref&gt;Directive 97/67/EC Art. 3(1)&lt;/ref&gt; This means once a working day deliveries and pick-ups, and that services that could be reserved for state monopolies include "clearance, sorting, transport and delivery of items of domestic correspondence and incoming cross-border correspondence".&lt;ref&gt;Directive 97/67/EC Art. 7(1)&lt;/ref&gt; For countries that had not liberalised postal services in any measure, the directive contained provisions to gradually open up to competition. It was intended to strike a balance between competition and continued quality service.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Directive 97/67/EC]] Praemble, "the reconciliation of the furtherance of the gradual, controlled liberalisation of the postal market and that of a durable guarantee of the provision of universal service."&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Deutsche Post'' decision&lt;ref&gt;OJ 2001 L125/27&lt;/ref&gt; the Commission took strong enforcement action. [[Deutsche Post]] was accused of [[predatory pricing]] in the business parcel delivery sector (i.e. not one of the services "reserved" under the directive) by the private firm [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]. The Commission ordered the structural separation of the normal postal services from business deliveries by Deutsche Post.&lt;ref&gt;see also, T-175/99 ''[[UPS Europe v Commission]]'' [2002] ECR II-1915, para 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
{{main article|Competition law theory}}
[[File:Monopoly-surpluses.svg|thumb|right|The economist's depiction of [[deadweight loss]] to efficiency that monopolies cause]]
Article 101 TFEU's goals are unclear. There are two main schools of thought. The predominant view is that only consumer welfare considerations are relevant there.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:52010XC0330(02):EN:NOT Commission's Article 101(3) Guidelines], the Court of First Instance's recent Glaxo Case and certain academic works, such as Okeoghene Odudu, ''The boundaries of EC competition law: the scope of article 81'' (OUP 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; However, a recent book argues that this position is erroneous and that other Member State and European Union public policy goals (such as public health and the environment) should also be considered there.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Townley, ''Article 81 EC and Public Policy'' (Hart 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; If this argument is correct then it could have a profound effect on the outcome of cases&lt;ref&gt;The ECJ's judgement in the ''Glaxo'' case is eagerly awaited, for example.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Modernisation process as a whole.

The theory behind mergers is that transaction costs can be reduced compared to operating on an open market through bilateral contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coase |first=Ronald H. |authorlink=Ronald H. Coase |date=November 1937 |title=The Nature of the Firm |journal=Economica |volume=4 |issue=16 |pages=386–405 |url=http://www.cerna.ensmp.fr/Enseignement/CoursEcoIndus/SupportsdeCours/COASE.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=10 February 2007 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-0335.1937.tb00002.x |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113063048/http://www.cerna.ensmp.fr/Enseignement/CoursEcoIndus/SupportsdeCours/COASE.pdf |archivedate=13 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentrations can increase [[economies of scale]] and scope. However, often firms take advantage of their increase in market power, their increased market share and decreased number of competitors, which can have a knock on effect on the deal that consumers get. Merger control is about predicting what the market might be like, not knowing and making a judgment.

The '''Federated Rubber and Allied Workers' Union of Australia''' was an [[Australia]]n [[trade union]] which existed between 1909 and 1988.&lt;ref name=Huntley/&gt; The union represented workers employed in manufacturing [[rubber]], [[plastic]], [[electrical cable]], [[adhesive]] and [[abrasive]] products in Australia.&lt;ref name=Huntley&gt;Huntley, Pat and Huntley, Ian. (1985). "''Inside Australia's Top 100 Trade Union''". Northbridge:Ian Huntley Pty. Ltd. {{ISBN|0-9589527-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Federated Rubber and Allied Workers' Union was formed in 1909 and achieved registration in 1911 as the '''Rubber Workers' Union of Australia''', before adopting their final name in 1933.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Smith, Bruce A. created 4 November 2001, last modified 12 December 2002. ''Trade Union Entry: Federated Rubber &amp; Allied Workers Union of Australia''. "http://www.atua.org.au/biogs/ALE0486b.htm" [[Australian Trade Union Archives]]. Retrieved 7 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The union's membership was principally in the [[shoemaking|footwear]] and [[automotive industry|automotive]] industries, and membership decreased as these industries restructured in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=Huntley/&gt;

The Federated Rubber and Allied Workers' Union amalgamated with the [[Federated Storemen and Packers Union]] in 1988 to form the [[National Union of Storeworkers, Packers, Rubber and Allied Workers]].&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; This body then merged with several other small unions in 1991 to form the [[National Union of Workers]], which continues to provide representation for workers employed in the rubber industry.&lt;ref name="NUW"&gt;''Background - National Union of Workers''.

'''Francisco J. Collazo''' (born 1931) is the [[CEO]] and President of Collazo Enterprises Inc. He is the co-founder of COLSA Corporation, a business enterprise which provides engineering and support services to [[NASA]], [[U.S. Army]], [[U.S. Air Force]], [[U.S. Navy]], [[Defense Intelligence Agency]], and the [[Missile Defense Agency]]. In 2012, COLSA Corp. was recognized by Hispanic Business Magazine as being one of the top 100 Hispanic Businesses in the United States.&lt;ref name="HBM"&gt;[http://www.hispanicbusiness.com/research/500/list.asp Hispanic Business Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Collazo was born in the city of [[Utuado, Puerto Rico]] and grew up in his father's farm. He received his primary education in his hometown. In 1946, he dropped out of high school and joined the [[United States Army]]. He continued his education while serving in the military and retired from the Army after 30 years of service with the rank of [[Warrant officer (United States)|Chief Warrant Officer]]. Among his military decorations was the [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medal]] and the [[Bronze Star Medal]] with an [[Oak Leaf Cluster]] for his service during the [[Vietnam War]]. Mr. Collazo is a service-connected disabled veteran.&lt;ref name="FC"&gt;[http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-378424 CNN]&lt;/ref&gt;

Collazo attended the [[University of Texas]] in [[Austin, Texas]] where he earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in Mathematics and Computer Science. He later earned a master of Computer Systems Engineering from the [[Southeastern Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="FC"/&gt;

==COLSA Corporation==
Collazo and his wife, whom he married in 1955, moved to [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. In 1980, they founded COLSA Corporation in the garage of their home. The principal idea behind the foundation of the new company was to provide systems analysis and engineering in support of air defense systems material development. By 1983, the company had 20 employees. &lt;ref name="FC"/&gt; That same year, the Government awarded COLSA its first prime contract.&lt;ref name="HCC"&gt;[http://www.colsa.com/about.html The History of COLSA Corporation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504231159/http://www.colsa.com/about.html |date=2016-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company moved from Collazo's garage to South Memorial Parkway in Huntsville and later to Sparkman Drive. The company is current;y located in Cummings Research Park.&lt;ref name="FC"/&gt; In 1997, COLSA was awarded the Cogswell Award for Excellence in Security Operations. In 2003, COLSA acquired Huntsville-based Pace and Waite, Inc., and Digital Wizards, Inc. Among COLSA’s clients are NASA, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Missile Defense Agency.&lt;ref name="HCC"/&gt;

Under Collazo's leadership the company grew and continued to expand. The company has regional offices in [[Washington, DC]]; [[Orlando, Florida]]; [[Shalimar, Florida]]; [[San Diego, California]], [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] and [[Sierra Vista, Arizona]].&lt;ref name="HCC"/&gt;

==Collazo Enterprises, Inc.==

On January 2, 1996, Collazo incorporated Collazo Enterprises the primary holding company that owns all stock in COLSA Corporation, COLSA International, FJC Growth Capital, and FCA Properties.&lt;ref name="HCC"/&gt; In 2000, Collazo Enterprises, Inc. established the Francisco J. Collazo (COLSA) Scholarship at the [[University of Alabama]]. The scholarship is awarded to full-time students majoring in Engineering, Science, Mathematics, or Technology and is based on academic merit, leadership potential, and contributions to school and community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meritaid.com/page/meritAid/programDetail.jsp?id=100706&amp;program=360217 University of Alabama at Huntsville Scholarships]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Collazo retired from the Army in 1976 and lives together with his wife has three children and seven grandchildren, continues to reside in Huntsville.&lt;ref name="FC"/&gt; He continues to be the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of COLSA Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=5967131&amp;privcapId=4277291&amp;previousCapId=4277291&amp;previousTitle=Collazo%20Enterprises,%20Inc.

'''Habitability''' is the conformance of a [[House|residence]] or [[wikt:abode|abode]] to the implied [[warranty]] of habitability. A residence that complies is said to be '''habitable'''. It is an [[implied warranty]] or contract, meaning it does not have to be an [[express contract]], [[Covenant (law)|covenant]], or [[provision (contracting)|provision]] of a [[contract]].  There was no implied warranty of habitability for tenants at [[common law]] and the [[legal doctrine]] has since developed in many jurisdictions through housing laws and regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landlord-Tenant Law|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/landlord-tenant_law|website=Wex|publisher=Cornell Law School|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duties of the Landlord|url=https://lawshelf.com/courseware/entry/duties-of-the-landlord|website=LawShelf|publisher=National Paralegal College|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Habitability is synonymous with '''tenantability'''.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/is-tenantability-broader-than-habitability--1934626.html "Is tenantability broader than habitability?"]
&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to be habitable, such housing usually:
* must provide shelter, with working locks
* must be heated in the winter months (typically between October 1 and May 31 in the [[Northeastern United States]])&lt;ref&gt;In New York, see N.Y. Multiple Dwelling Law § 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
* must not be infested with [[vermin]], roaches, termites, or [[mold]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3898/is_200406/ai_n9435714 Mold in condominium: Negligent maintenance: Breach of warranty of habitability: Settlement: Verdict | Law Reporter | Find Articles at BNET.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* requires the landlord to stop other tenants from making too much noise (as measured by the [[decibel]] scale), [[second-hand smoke]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ganshore.com/news10-06.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928142609/http://ganshore.com/news10-06.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or from selling [[narcotics]]
* must provide [[potable water]]

==New York law==
Some states, such as [[New York (state)|New York]], have given additional statutory protections in addition to those created by [[caselaw]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.oag.state.ny.us/realestate/habitability.html N.Y. Attorney General's Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312162610/http://www.oag.state.ny.us/realestate/habitability.html |date=2007-03-12 }}, [[q.v.]], and in External sources.&lt;/ref&gt;  These statutes include:
# Lobby attendant service by a [[concierge]] or landlord &lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Multiple Dwelling Law §50-c&lt;/ref&gt;
# Elevator mirrors &lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Multiple Dwelling Law §51-b; NYC Admin. Code §27-2042&lt;/ref&gt;
# Smoke detectors&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Multiple Residence Law §15; Buffalo Code Ch. 395; NYC Admin. Code §27-2045, §27-2046&lt;/ref&gt;
# Window guards&lt;ref&gt;NYC Health Code §131.15&lt;/ref&gt;

# Protection from [[lead paint]] &lt;ref&gt;NYC Health Code §173.14;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences==
Violation of the warranty of habitability results in [[constructive eviction]], whereby the [[landlord]] or [[wikt:Special:Search/lessor|lessor]] has, in effect, evicted the [[leasehold estate|tenant]] or [[lessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Josephson|first1=Richard C.|title=The Implied Warranty of Habitability in Landlord-Tenant Relations|journal=William &amp; Mary Law Review|date=1971|volume=12|issue=3|page=580|url=http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2742&amp;context=wmlr|accessdate=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tenant may remedy the problem,&lt;ref&gt;See N.Y.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4526">'''Jim Riswold''' (born 1957 in [[Seattle, Washington]]) was the former [[creative director]] for [[Portland, Oregon]] based [[advertising agency]] [[Wieden+Kennedy]] and an instructor for the agency's experimental advertising school, [[WK12]]: subject for [[WKE (WKEntertainment)]]'s upcoming web episodic [[documentary]], ''12''.

==Career In Advertising==

Riswold attended the [[University of Washington]] from 1976 to 1983, and received three bachelor's degrees in [[communication]]s, [[philosophy]] and [[history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=So What Good Is Studying Philosophy: You Want To Be A What? |publisher=University of Washington Philosophy Department |author=Jim Riswold |quote=Jim Riswold.

He also created the [[Bo Knows]] campaign for Nike featuring [[Bo Jackson]], and the [[Tiger Woods]] commercial, entitled "I Am Tiger Woods."

In 2013, Riswold was inducted into [[The One Club]]'s Creative Hall of Fame.

==Career In Art==

After being diagnosed with [[leukemia]] in 2000 and surviving for five years, Riswold quit advertising to become a full-time contemporary artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jim Riswold: Nike ad designer finds success, gets leukemia, turns to Hitler dolls. Huh? | url=http://www.wweek.com/editorial/3146/6741/ Willamette Week | quote=When Riswold, a onetime philosophy major whose iconic Nike ads made him an industry legend, was diagnosed with leukemia, he found solace in art. | date=September 21, 2005 | author=Zach Dundas | publisher=Willamette Week | accessdate=2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went from "a career of selling people things they don't need to making things that people don't want".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/creative/features/e3i2db03fb29d573ec5da757eab1f567a2b | title=Profile: Jim Riswold - Ex-Wieden CD celebrates the absurd | publisher=AdWeek | author=Gregory Solman | date=October 6, 2008 | accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riswold's photographs have been shown in galleries throughout the Northwest and hang in the permanent collections of several museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.augengallery.com/Artists_bio/bio_riswold.html | title=Augen Gallery - Bio: Jim Riswold | quote=(see various entries under the headings "Solo Exhibitions", "Group Exhibitions" and "Selected Collections) | accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his works poke fun at historically taboo figures [[Mao Zedong]], [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] by constructing monumental setting in which the figurines were photographer. Jim explained in his 2005 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' article, [http://www.esquire.com/features/essay/ESQ0905HITLER_164 Hitler Saved My Life] that "Instead of providing […] grand expositions mythologizing the dictator, toys, by definition, make their subjects seem small, childish, and trifling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esquire.com/features/essay/ESQ0905HITLER_164 | title=Hitler Saved My Life | author=Jim Riswold | publisher=Esquire | date=September 1, 2005 | accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kista''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈɕiːsta}}) is a district in the [[Districts of Sweden#Stockholm|borough]] of [[Rinkeby-Kista]], [[Stockholm Municipality|Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. It has a strategic position located in between Sweden's main airport, the [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport|Stockholm-Arlanda International Airport]] and central Stockholm, and alongside the main [[European route E4|national highway E4]] economic artery. Kista comprises residential and commercial areas, the latter in the highly technological [[telecommunication]] and [[information technology]] industry.&lt;ref name="OECD2013"/&gt; There are large research efforts in this entire area, which therefore is dubbed Kista Science City. It is known{{By whom?|date=October 2017}} as the research park of [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]].

Kista is the largest [[Information and communications technology|Information and Communications Technology (ICT)]] cluster in Europe,&lt;ref name="kista.com"&gt;http://www.kista.com&lt;/ref&gt; and the world's second largest&lt;ref&gt;Page 84.

It is the largest corporate area in Sweden, important to the national economy&lt;ref name="Kim2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kim|first=Junmo|title=Globalization and Industrial Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__lZdK1S4OkC&amp;pg=PA73|date=10 July 2005|isbn=978-1-4697-2393-8|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the presence of, among others, [[Ericsson Group]], the largest corporation in Sweden.

Kista Science City is the location where a large portion of the research and development of the world's [[LTE (telecommunication)|4G LTE]] mobile telephony infrastructure is being developed, a European [[ETSI]] standard used worldwide and Kista Science City has been the largest such cluster in Europe for decades.{{When?|date=October 2017}}&lt;ref name="kista.com"/&gt; A majority is done at [[Ericsson|Ericsson corporation]], with 100,000 employees worldwide, but with its research and worldwide Headquarters in the Kista Science City.

Kista was named after an old farm "Kista Gård", still located in the area. The construction of the modern parts were started in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="AntonellaEmma2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Antonella|first1=Noya|last2=Emma|first2=Clarence|last3=Gary|first3=Craig|title=Local Economic and Employment Development (LEED) Community Capacity Building Creating a Better Future Together: Creating a Better Future Together|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_TFVEFrqSsC&amp;pg=PA119|date=7 December 2009|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-07329-6|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the streets in Kista are named after towns and places in [[Denmark]], [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], and [[Faroe Islands]]. Before the opening of the [[Mall of Scandinavia]], [[Kista Galleria]] was the biggest shopping center in the [[Stockholm County|Stockholm region]]. 
Because of its [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] industries, it became in the 1980s referred to as "Chipsta"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.se/books?id=Z-dXAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=Chipsta+kista&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8qjzjkswI8&amp;sig=ZCf-NhrPh8iVUvsLFXXgD6OkEco&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiMjKqUu87eAhVJqIsKHQ89CrkQ6AEwDXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Chipsta%20kista&amp;f=false|title=Urban Innovation Systems: What makes them tick?|last=Winden|first=Willem van|last2=Braun|first2=Erik|last3=Otgaar|first3=Alexander|last4=Witte|first4=Jan-Jelle|date=2014-04-11|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317917458|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, after Sweden joined the EU in 1995, also as Europe's "Silicon Valley".&lt;ref name="AntonellaEmma2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordichardware.se/Coverage/overclocking-at-intel.html|title=Overclocking at Intel|publisher=Nordichardware.se|accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
Kista is the largest corporate area in Sweden and important to the national economy.&lt;ref name="OECD2013"&gt;{{cite book|title=OECD Green Growth Studies Green Growth in Stockholm, Sweden|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4G3oCqJJJScC&amp;pg=PA70|date=23 May 2013|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-19515-8|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The construction of the industrial section of Kista began in the 1970s with companies such as SRA (Svenska Radioaktiebolaget, now a part of [[Ericsson]]), RIFA AB (later Ericsson Components AB, and later still Ericsson Microelectronics AB, and now Infineon Technologies), and IBM Svenska AB (the Swedish branch of [[International Business Machines|IBM]]). [[Ericsson]] has had its headquarters in Kista since 2003.&lt;ref name="Kim2005"/&gt;

== Research and higher learning ==

Kista hosts entire departments of both [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]], such as Wireless@KTH, and [[Stockholm University]] (formerly jointly known as "the IT University").&lt;ref name="DesaiNijkamp2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Sameeksha Desai|Desai]]|first1=Sameeksha|last2=Nijkamp|first2=Peter|last3=Stough|first3=Roger R.|title=New Directions in Regional Economic Development: The Role of Entrepreneurship Theory and Methods, Practice and Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6eY4LtrIOcC&amp;pg=PA249|date=July 2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-0-85793-351-5|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also Swedish national research institutes (pure research, no students) such as the [[Swedish Institute of Computer Science]] and [[Swedish Defence Research Agency|Swedish Defence Research Agency, FOI]] who has its Headquarters there, just as [[Ericsson]],  [[IBM|Swedish IBM]] and [[Tele 2]], among others has.

Also the Swedish Co-location Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eitdigital.eu/about-us/locations/stockholm-node/|title=EIT Digital Stockholm Node|last=|first=|date=|work=EIT Digital corporate website|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; of EU innovation and entrepreneurial education organisation [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology|EIT]] Digital is located in Kista and offers a 2-year Master program&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kth.se/student/kurser/program/TIVNM/20182/genomforande?l=en|title=Master's Programme, ICT Innovation, 120 credits (TIVNM), Programme syllabus for studies starting in autumn 2018, Implementation of the education {{!}} KTH|website=www.kth.se|language=en|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in colaboration with [[Royal Institute of Technology|KTH Royal Institute of Technology]].

'''Martin Luther King Jr. Day''' (officially '''Birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/snow-dismissal-procedures/federal-holidays/#url=2013 |title=Federal Holidays |publisher=Opm.gov |accessdate=January 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Federal holidays in the United States|American federal holiday]] marking the birthday of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] It is observed on the third Monday of January each year, which is around King's birthday, January 15. The holiday is similar to holidays set under the [[Uniform Monday Holiday Act]]. The earliest Monday for this holiday is January 15 and the latest is January 21.

King was the chief spokesperson for [[nonviolence|nonviolent]] activism in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], which successfully protested racial discrimination in federal and state law. The campaign for a federal holiday in King's honor began soon after [[Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|his assassination]] in 1968. President [[Ronald Reagan]] signed the holiday into law in 1983, and it was first observed three years later. At first, some states resisted observing the holiday as such, giving it alternative names or combining it with other holidays. It was officially observed in all 50 states for the first time in 2000.

==History==

[[File:Reagan signs Martin Luther King bill.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|[[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Coretta Scott King]] at the Martin Luther King Jr. Day signing ceremony.]]
The idea of Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a holiday was promoted by [[trade union|labor unions]] in contract negotiations.&lt;ref name="nation"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones |first=William P. |date=January 30, 2006 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/working-class-hero?page=full |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnLFgB58?url=http://www.thenation.com/article/working-class-hero?page=full |title=Working-Class Hero |work=[[The Nation]] |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After King's death, [[United States Representative|U.S. Representative]] [[John Conyers]] (a Democrat from [[Michigan]]) and [[United States Senator|U.S. Senator]] [[Edward Brooke]] (a Republican from [[Massachusetts]]) introduced a bill in Congress to make King's birthday a national holiday. The bill first came to a vote in the U.S. House of Representatives in 1979. However, it fell five votes short of the number needed for passage.&lt;ref name="Wolfen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolfensberger |first=Don |date=January 14, 2008 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/events/docs/King%20Holiday-essay-drw.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnLjow8L?url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/events/docs/King%20Holiday-essay-drw.pdf |title=The Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday: The Long Struggle in Congress, An Introductory Essay |publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the main arguments mentioned by opponents were that a paid holiday for federal employees would be too expensive, and that a holiday to honor a private citizen would be contrary to longstanding tradition (King had never held public office).&lt;ref name="Wolfen" /&gt; Only two other figures have national holidays in the U.S. honoring them: [[George Washington]] and [[Christopher Columbus]].&lt;!-- Please do not change this sentence. The *national* holiday is Washington's Birthday, not President's Day (which is the name of a state holiday in many states). --&gt;

Soon after, the [[Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site|King Center]] turned to support from the corporate community and the general public. The success of this strategy was cemented when musician [[Stevie Wonder]] released the single "[[Happy Birthday (Stevie Wonder song)|Happy Birthday]]" to popularize the campaign in 1980 and hosted the Rally for Peace Press Conference in 1981. Six million signatures were collected for a petition to Congress to pass the law, termed by a 2006 article in ''[[The Nation]]'' as "the largest petition in favor of an issue in U.S. history."&lt;ref name="nation"/&gt;

Senators [[Jesse Helms]] and [[John Porter East]] (both [[North Carolina]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]s) led opposition to the holiday and questioned whether King was important enough to receive such an honor. Helms criticized King's opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] and accused him of espousing "action-oriented [[Marxism]]".&lt;ref name="dewar"&gt;{{cite news|last=Dewar |first=Helen |date=October 4, 1983 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opinions/articles/helms_stalls_kings_day.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnjqzpMi?url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opinions/articles/helms_stalls_kings_day.html |title=Helms Stalls King's Day in Senate |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A01 |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Helms led a filibuster against the bill and on October 3, 1983, submitted a 300-page document to the Senate alleging that King had associations with [[Communism|communists]]. New York Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] declared the document a "packet of filth", threw it on the Senate floor and stomped on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Romero|first=Frances|title=A Brief History of Martin Luther King Jr. Day|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1872501,00.html|newspaper=Time|date=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtwright|first=David T.|title=No Right Turn: Conservative Politics in a Liberal America|year=2010|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-04677-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=J5Vb52f6rOIC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=moynihan+%22packet+of+filth%22#v=onepage&amp;q=moynihan%20%22packet%20of%20filth%22&amp;f=false|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]] originally opposed the holiday, citing cost concerns. When asked to comment on Helms' accusations that King was a communist, the president said "We'll know in thirty-five years, won't we?", in reference to the eventual release of [[FBI]] surveillance tapes that had previously been [[record sealing|sealed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Younge|first1=Gary|title=The Misremembering of 'I Have a Dream'|journal=The Nation|date=September 2–9, 2013|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/175764/misremembering-i-have-dream#|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; But on November 2, 1983, Reagan signed a bill, proposed by [[Katie Hall (politician)|Representative Katie Hall]] of Indiana, to create a federal holiday honoring King.&lt;ref name="reagan"&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolley |first=John T. |author2=Gerhard Peters |date=November 2, 1983 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=40708 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnN6qLAO?url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=40708 |title=Ronald Reagan: Remarks on Signing the Bill Making the Birthday of Martin Luther King Jr., a National Holiday |publisher=[[The American Presidency Project]] |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|98|399|98|1475|1983|11|02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill had passed the House of Representatives by a count of 338 to 90, a veto-proof margin.&lt;ref name="dewar"/&gt; The holiday was observed for the first time on January 20, 1986.

The bill also established the Martin Luther King Jr. Federal Holiday Commission to oversee observance of the holiday, and [[Coretta Scott King]], King's wife, was made a member of this commission for life by [[George H. W. Bush|President George H. W. Bush]] in May 1989.&lt;ref name="bush"&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolley |first=John T. |author2=Gerhard Peters |date=May 17, 1989 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=17040 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnNNh4n5?url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=17040 |title=George Bush: Remarks on Signing the Martin Luther King Jr., Federal Holiday Commission Extension Act |publisher=[[The American Presidency Project]] |accessdate=January 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|101|30|103|60|1989|05|17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State-level passage==
Although the federal holiday honoring King was signed into law in 1983 and took effect three years later, not every U.S. state chose to observe the holiday at the state level until 1991, when the [[New Hampshire]] legislature created "Civil Rights Day" and abolished "[[Fast Day]]".&lt;ref name="nhgov"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilbreth |first=Donna |year=1997 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/fast.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnmmR8yQ?url=http://www.nh.gov/nhinfo/fast.html |title=Rise and Fall of Fast Day |publisher=New Hampshire State Library |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, [[Utah]] became the last state to have a holiday named after King when "Human Rights Day" was officially changed to "Martin Luther King Jr. Day."&lt;ref name="newcrisis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Petrie|first=Phil W.|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/3783538/mlk-holiday-branches-work-make-work|title=The MLK holiday: Branches work to make it work|date=May–June 2000|work=[[The New Crisis]]|accessdate=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Arizona [[List of Governors of Arizona|Governor]] [[Bruce Babbitt]], a Democrat, created a paid state MLK holiday in Arizona by executive order just before he left office, but in 1987, his Republican successor [[Evan Mecham]], citing an attorney general's opinion that Babbitt's order was illegal, reversed Babbitt's decision days after taking office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ye Hee Lee|first=Michelle|title=Recalling Arizona's struggle for MLK holiday|url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/news/articles/20120112martin-luther-king-holiday-dilemma.html#ixzz2IYEyGRdg|accessdate=January 20, 2013|newspaper=[[The Arizona Republic]]|date=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Mecham proclaimed the third Sunday in January to be "Martin Luther King Jr./Civil Rights Day" in Arizona, albeit as an unpaid holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Civil Rights Day in United States|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/civil-rights-day|website=timeanddate.com|publisher=Time and Date AS|accessdate=April 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Arizona voters were given the opportunity to vote on giving state employees a paid MLK holiday. That same year, the [[National Football League]] threatened to move [[Super Bowl XXVII]], which was planned for Arizona in 1993, if the MLK holiday was voted down.&lt;ref name="TucsonSentinel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/101611_az_mlk_dedication/arizonans-recall-fight-state-mlk-holiday |title=tucsonsentinel.com |publisher=tucsonsentinel.com |accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the November election, the voters were offered two King Day options: Proposition 301, which replaced [[Columbus Day]] on the list of paid state holidays, and Proposition 302, which merged [[Lincoln's Birthday|Lincoln's]] and [[Washington's Birthday|Washington's]] birthdays into one paid holiday to make room for MLK Day. Both measures failed to pass, with only 49% of voters approving Prop 302, the more popular of the two options; although some who voted "no" on 302 voted "yes" on Prop 301.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shumway|first1=Jim|title=STATE OF ARIZONA OFFICIAL CANVASS – GENERAL ELECTION – November 6, 1990|url=http://azsos.gov/sites/azsos.gov/files/canvass1990ge.pdf|website=Arizona Secretary of State ~ Home Page|publisher=Arizona Secretary of State|accessdate=April 11, 2015|page=12|format=PDF|date=November 26, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the state lost the chance to host Super Bowl XXVII, which was subsequently held at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] in [[Pasadena, California]].&lt;ref name="TucsonSentinel"/&gt; In a 1992 referendum, the voters, this time given only one option for a paid King Day, approved state-level recognition of the holiday.&lt;ref name="Reingold2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reingold|first=Beth|title=Representing Women: Sex, Gender, and Legislative Behavior in Arizona and California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENZoKQzCsk0C&amp;pg=PA66|accessdate=May 4, 2014|year=2000|publisher=Univ of North Carolina Press|isbn=9780807848500|pages=66–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2000, South Carolina governor [[Jim Hodges]] signed a bill to make King's birthday an official state holiday. South Carolina was the last state to recognize the day as a paid holiday for all state employees. Prior to this, employees could choose between celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day or one of three [[Confederate holidays]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/spot/mlkhistory1.html The History of Martin Luther King Day], Infoplease&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative names==
While all states now observe the holiday, some did not name the day after King. For example, in New Hampshire, the holiday was known as "Civil Rights Day" until 1999, when the State Legislature voted to change the name of the holiday to Martin Luther King Day.&lt;ref name="nyt99"&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldberg |first=Carey |date=May 26, 1999 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E0DC1031F935A15756C0A96F958260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Carey%20Goldberg%20Martin%20Luther%20King%201999&amp;st=cse |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnlpRF0r?url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A07E0DC1031F935A15756C0A96F958260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=Carey%20Goldberg%20Martin%20Luther%20King%201999&amp;st=cse |title=Contrarian New Hampshire To Honor Dr. King, at Last |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=January 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several additional states have chosen to combine commemorations of King's birthday with other observances:
*In [[Alabama]]: "[[Robert E. Lee Day|Robert E. Lee]]/Martin Luther King Birthday".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=Alabama.gov|url=http://inform.alabama.gov/calendar.aspx|title=Calendar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In [[Arkansas]]: it was known as "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday and [[Robert E. Lee Day|Robert E. Lee's Birthday]]" from 1985 to 2017. Legislation in March 2017 changed the name of the state holiday to "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s Birthday" and moved the commemoration of Lee to October.

==Workplace observance==
[[File:MLK Day March (Eugene, Oregon).jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|A Martin Luther King Day march in Oregon]]

Overall, in 2007, 33% of employers gave employees the day off, a 2% increase over the previous year. There was little difference in observance by large and small employers: 33% for firms with over 1,000 employees; and, 32% for firms with under 1,000 employees. The observance is most popular among nonprofit organizations and least popular among factories and manufacturers.&lt;ref name="bna"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cody |first=Karen James |date=January 9, 2007 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.bna.com/press/2007/specialreports/mlkday07.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnn7LcRx?url=http://www.bna.com/press/2007/specialreports/mlkday07.htm |title=More Employers Plan to Observe Martin Luther King Day |publisher=[[Bureau of National Affairs]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this have varied, ranging from the recent addition of the holiday, to its occurrence just two weeks after the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, when many businesses are closed for part or sometimes all of the week. Additionally, many schools and places of higher education are closed for classes; others remain open but may hold seminars or celebrations of King's message. The observance of MLK Day has led to some colleges and universities extending their Christmas break to include the day as part of break. Some factories and manufacturers used MLK Day as a [[Long weekend|floating or movable holiday]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==King Day of Service==
[[File:MLK service obama.JPG|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] serving lunch at a Washington soup kitchen on MLK Jr. Day, 2010]]

The national Martin Luther King Day of Service&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nationalservice.gov/mlkday | title = Volunteer opportunities and resources for organizing an MLK Day of Service event | website = Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service homepage | publisher = Corporation for National and Community Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; was started by former Pennsylvania U.S. Senator [[Harris Wofford]] and Atlanta Congressman [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], who co-authored the King Holiday and Service Act. The federal legislation challenges Americans to transform the King Holiday into a day of citizen action volunteer service in honor of King. The federal legislation was signed into law by [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] on August 23, 1994. Since 1996, Wofford's former state office director, [[Todd Bernstein]], has been directing the annual Greater Philadelphia King Day of Service,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlkdayofservice.org/|title=Greater Philadelphia Martin Luther King Day of Service|publisher=Global Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest event in the nation honoring King.&lt;ref name="slt"&gt;{{cite news |last=Moore |first=Doug |date=January 16, 2011 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_4429b5c3-3d55-5c08-81d4-e9ac71919ebe.html |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnstgaHT?url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/article_4429b5c3-3d55-5c08-81d4-e9ac71919ebe.html |title=MLK events in Missouri form man's legacy |work=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other universities and organizations around the U.S., such as [[Arizona State University]], Greater DC Cares and [[City Year]], participate in the Martin Luther King Jr. Day of Service.  In honor of MLK, hundreds of Volunteer Centers, and volunteers across the country donate their time to make a difference on this day.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The only other official national day of service in the U.S., as designated by the government, is [[September 11 National Day of Service]] (9/11 Day).{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Outside the United States==
One place outside the U.S. where Martin Luther King Jr. Day is observed in the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]] under mayor [[Tadatoshi Akiba]], who holds a special banquet at the mayor's office as an act of unifying his city's call for peace with King's message of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city.hiroshima.lg.jp/shimin/heiwa/martin.html|title=Mayor's Speech at U.S. Conference of Mayors' Luncheon in commemoration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.|website=www.city.hiroshima.lg.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[City of Toronto]], in Ontario, Canada, is another city that has officially recognized Martin Luther King Jr. Day, although not as a paid holiday: all government services and businesses remain open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller |first=David |authorlink=David Miller (Canadian politician) |year=2008 |archivedate=January 17, 2011 |url=http://www.toronto.ca/proclamations/2010/martinlutherkingjrday2010.htm |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5vnpGaDSS?url=http://www.toronto.ca/proclamations/2010/martinlutherkingjrday2010.htm |title=City of Toronto Proclamation |publisher=[[City of Toronto]] |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, during a visit by the [[U.S. Sixth Fleet]], [[Navy Chaplain Corps|Navy chaplain]] Rabbi [[Arnold Resnicoff]] conducted the first Israeli presidential ceremony in commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, held in the [[Beit HaNassi|President's Residence]], Jerusalem. [[Aura Herzog]], wife of Israel's then-President [[Chaim Herzog]], noted that she was especially proud to host this special event, because Israel had a national forest in honor of King, and that Israel and King shared the idea of "dreams".&lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Week &amp; The American Examiner'', pg 37, February 3, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Resnicoff continued this theme in his remarks during the ceremony, quoting the verse from Genesis, spoken by the brothers of Joseph when they saw their brother approach, "Behold the dreamer comes; let us slay him and throw him into the pit, and see what becomes of his dreams." Resnicoff noted that, from time immemorial, there have been those who thought they could kill the dream by slaying the dreamer, but – as the example of King's life shows – such people are always wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Veterans History Project Oral History, Arnold Resnicoff, May 2010.

Every year, since 1986, the Dr. Martin Luther King Tribute and Dinner is held in Wassenaar, The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nl.usembassy.gov/martin-luther-king-jr-tribute-dinner/|title=Martin Luther King, Jr. Tribute Dinner|last=|first=|date=2017-01-30|website=U.S. Embassy &amp; Consulate in the Netherlands|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tribute includes young people and veterans of the Civil Rights Movement as well as music.  it always ends with everyone holding hands in a circle and singing "We Shall Overcome." The Tribute is held on the last Sunday in January and bridges Dr. King's birthday and [[Black History Month]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Metis''' is a family of client and server products for creating, visualizing, changing, sharing and managing visual enterprise models. It was originally created by a Norwegian company named Metis AS, which was bought by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]. Metis was then sold to [[AT&amp;T]].  After the AT&amp;T/NCR split in 1996, Metis became a part of NCR.  In 2001 the Metis group and product was sold to [[Computas AS]].  In 2004 Computas AS was split into two: Computas, and Computas Technology. In 2005 Computas Technology was merged with Troux Technologies, which was acquired by [[Planview]] Inc. in 2015.

In addition to providing general modeling mechanisms and primitives, Metis doesn't restrict the modeling to one particular methodology. It provides the opportunity for developing in several modeling languages and comes with built-in templates for [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]], [[Business Process Modeling Notation|BPM]], [[EEML]], GEM, I*, MEML-2 and Misuse, together with an option to merge these so that one can benefit from the strongest aspects of each language.

Metis supports sub-modeling, which makes it convenient to develop partial models in teams. These models can then later be merged. Metis has functionality for web-supported distributed development by providing support for working towards a fileserver.

Metis runs on the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] platform and is built on open web standards such as [[XML]], [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]], [[HTTP]], [[SOAP]], [[SVG]] and [[UNICODE]].

Metis incorporates functions for analyzing models and for accessing data outside of the model. For example:

* Searching for information in an enterprise that satisfies simple or complex criteria.
* Creation of multiple views to a model for addressing different audiences or areas.
* Navigation of a model, such as zooming into containers.
* Performing methods such as calculations.
* Linking a model to external data.
* Exchanging data with other application.

In 2002, Al Jaber acquired the famous [[Grand Hotel, Vienna]] from the Japanese airline [[All Nippon Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grandhotelwien.com/media/2626141/140-years-grand-hotel-wien.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416192350/http://www.grandhotelwien.com/media/2626141/140-years-grand-hotel-wien.pdf |archivedate=2014-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later acquired the premises of a former bank on Kärntner Ring and converted the building to the boutique Ring Hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theringhotel.com/|title=Relais &amp; Chateaux Hotel The Ring - stay in the center of everything|website=The Ring Hotel|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2006, Al Jaber bought the Palais Corso, Vienna's premier luxury shopping and office complex from [[Assicurazioni Generali|Generali]] Versicherung, for about €70 million.&lt;ref&gt;Irina Frühmann, [http://www.wirtschaftsblatt.at/archiv/unternehmen/scheich-kauft-palais-corso-61459/index.do "Scheich kauft Palais Corso"], ''Wirtschaftsblatt'', 5 October 2006 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Al Jaber agreed to invest 10% in the building of the Vienna Tourism University ([[MODUL University Vienna|Modul University Vienna]]), a project handled by the [[Austrian Federal Economic Chamber|Vienna Economic Chamber]] &lt;ref&gt;Magdalena Klemun, [http://diepresse.com/home/panorama/oesterreich/316437/Startschuss-fuer-private-TourismusUni?from=suche.intern.portal%20 "Startschuss für private Tourismus-Uni"], ''Die Presse'', 11 July 2007 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided scholarships for students there both personally and through his Foundation.&lt;ref name="modul.ac.at"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modul.ac.at/article/view/sheikh-mohamed-bin-issa-al-jaber-awarded-as-honorary-senator-of-modul-university-vienna/|title=Sheikh Mohamed Bin Issa Al Jaber awarded as Honorary Senator of MODUL University Vienna|website=MODUL University Vienna|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2007, JJW signed an agreement for the takeover and the expansion of the Palace Schwarzenberg Hotel in Vienna, along with Magnat Real Estate. However, delays to the project led to its cancellation. An amicable settlement  was reached.&lt;ref&gt;Leo Himmelbauer, [http://www.wirtschaftsblatt.at/home/oesterreich/branchen/scheich-al-jaber-zahlt-265-millionen-euro-fuer-streit-beilegung-500244/index.do "Scheich Al Jaber zahlt 2,65 Millionen Euro für Streit-Beilegung"], ''Wirtschaftsblatt'', 14 December 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://immobilien.diepresse.com/home/oesterreich/653187/Hotel-Schwarzenberg_Doch-kein-Geld-von-Al-Jaber "Hotel Schwarzenberg: Doch kein Geld von Al Jaber?"], ''Die Presse'', 24 April 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of 2008, Al Jaber proposed to help the financially troubled [[Austrian Airlines]] with investments through taking a 20% stake in the company. However, he withdrew his offer in May 2008 after the company published its negative quarterly results, based on the grounds that the company intentionally withheld the actual level of trouble faced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://austrianaviation.net/news-regional/news-detail/datum/2011/06/09/mohamed-al-jaber-sagt-engagement-ab.html "Mohamed Al Jaber sagt Engagement ab"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203055317/http://www.austrianaviation.net/news-regional/news-detail/datum/2011/06/09/mohamed-al-jaber-sagt-engagement-ab.html |date=2013-12-03 }}, ''Austrian aviation.net'', 3 May 2008 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Auditor Herbert Heiser, who was called by the court to consult in the legal dispute between AUA and Al Jaber, agreed with Al Jaber’s conclusions.

In July 2008, Al Jaber took a 60% stake in [[Kneissl|Kneissl Holding GmbH]], an Austrian manufacturer of sports equipment. JJA Beteiligungsverwaltungs GmbH bought the entire company in December 2012 for €1,98 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/722406/Geld-an-Kneissl_Scheich-Al-Jaber-raeumt-auf "Geld an Kneissl: Scheich Al Jaber räumt auf"], ''Die Presse'', 9 February 2012 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beate Troger, [http://www.tt.com/Nachrichten/4217648-2/kneissl-gerettet-sanierung-des-scheichs-angenommen.csp "Kneissl gerettet, Sanierung des Scheichs angenommen"], ''Tiroler Tageszeitung'', 26 January 2012 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Vienna's Trialog Institut named Al Jaber 'Man of the Year' for his work in promoting inter-cultural understanding. Presenting the award, Karl Blecha, former Federal Minister of the Interior and of the Austrian-Arabic Association, praised Al Jaber for his work towards building bridges through education and understanding and his support of peace, tolerance and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trialog Man of the Year|url=http://trialoginstitut.at/images/stories/PRESSE/press_07.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miscellaneous Information==

Between 2010 and 2012, Jadawel International was cited in various reports published by New York-based NGO Human Rights Watch (HRW) on the topic of Saudi restrictive residency laws. Following investigation, Human Rights Watch’s 2013 World report is not reporting any further issues and has cleared the company.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/wr2013_web.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Al Jaber's Foundation has signed an agreement with [[Human Rights Watch]] to support civil society and promote human rights in the Arab World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbifoundation.com/good-governance/human-rights-watch.asp|title=MBI Al Jaber Foundation|website=www.mbifoundation.com|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, proceedings were filed against the Non-Executive Chairman of AJWA group for Food Industries, for facts being documented in the company records by members of the company administration. The charges were against the Non-Executive Chairman of Ajwa, for acts that were performed by the employees of the company, and resulted in the company being fined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/26/ajwa-conviction-idUSLDE74P12O20110526 | work=Reuters | title=CORRECTED - Egypt court fines Ajwa nonexecutive chairman | date=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2013, Al Jaber was exonerated of any wrongdoing by the Head of Appeals Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2013/02/12/265855.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sawtbeirut.com/breaking/154683|title=راديو صوت بيروت إنترناشونال Radio Sawt Beirut Int|website=راديو صوت بيروت إنترناشونال|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Jaber is now a shareholder of the company.

In May 2011, Al Jaber publicly denounced a defamation campaign by Austrian Media which had sought to imply financial difficulties in some of the companies that Al Jaber had invested in. He accused the newspapers of reporting a one-sided version of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20110502_OTS0232/sheik-al-jaber-wehrt-sich-gegen-einseitige-berichterstattung|title=Sheik Al Jaber wehrt sich gegen einseitige Berichterstattung.|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/1303291352166/Ich-liebe-Oesterreich-Scheich-Al-Jaber-will-noch-mehr-investieren|title=Scheich Al Jaber will noch mehr investieren - derStandard.at|website=DER STANDARD|accessdate=21 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Money for Breakfast''''' was a morning [[business]] program which aired on the [[Fox Business Network]] weekdays from 7-9am [[Eastern Time]].  Its main competitor was [[CNBC]]'s ''[[Squawk Box]]''.

==About the program==

''Money for Breakfast'', which debuted on October 15, 2007 — the same day the network was launched — followed pre-market business headlines.  This program was anchored by [[Alexis Glick]] and  [[Peter Barnes (journalist)|Peter Barnes]]. The executive producer was [[Brian Donlon]], a morning show veteran from CBS' ''Early Show'' (now ''[[CBS This Morning]]'')  and ESPN's Cold Pizza (now ''[[First Take (TV series)|First Take]]'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/09/fox_business_network_adds_four.php&lt;/ref&gt;  Contributors and reporters included [[Jenna Lee]] (who reported the latest business headlines), Fox Business stocks editor Liz MacDonald, and Fox Business contributor [[Charles Payne (journalist)|Charles Payne]].

''Money for Breakfast'' scored a major coup in June 2008, when it landed the first interview with any Fox entity with Democratic Presidential candidate Sen.[[Barack Obama]]. It was notable for the word association "game" the then White House hopeful "played" with anchor Alexis Glick.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/fun-and-games-with-obama_b19861&lt;/ref&gt;

''Money for Breakfast'' was reduced from four hours to three on December 12, 2007 as ''[[The Opening Bell on Fox Business]]'', also hosted by Glick, replaced the fourth hour of this program.  On May 12, 2008, it was contracted to two hours as Fox Business Network replaced the first hour of this show (6-7am ET) with the second hour of the expanded ''[[Fox Business Morning]]''.

[[Peter Barnes (journalist)|Peter Barnes]], who was Glick's co-anchor since the show's debut, left the show on May 5, 2008 as he became the network's senior [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] correspondent.  Glick became the sole anchor of the show from May 12, 2008 through its final show on September 25, 2009.

''Money for Breakfast'' debuted a new show logo (which then had the word "FOR" inside the letter "O") and moved to a new set in Studio G on April 20, 2009. The program also added a regular tech segment with  [[Shibani Joshi]] and added a daily panel debate segment at 8 am called "At Issue" which featured a variety of guests from politics, business and entertainment.  This program, along with ''The Opening Bell on Fox Business'' (also with Alexis Glick),''Countdown to the Closing Bell'', ''Fox Business Bulls &amp; Bears'' and ''Cavuto'' all shared that same set in the then-new Studio G.

==Cancellation==
On September 3, 2009, the program was canceled to make way for ''[[Imus in the Morning]]''; Glick then became a contributor to the Imus program until her departure from FBN at the end of 2009.  The last episode of ''Money for Breakfast'' aired September 25, 2009, at which point FBN debuted a new online-only program with the cast of ''Fox Business Morning'' and ''Money for Breakfast''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/09{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} March 2009-09-03_shock_jock_don_imus_signs_deal_with_fox_business_network.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The program, at the time of its cancellation, averaged less than 17,700 viewers according to unofficial estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Krakauer, Steve (2009-10-06).

'''''Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams''''' is a 1987 book on the social side of software development, specifically managing project teams.  It was written by software consultants [[Tom DeMarco]] and [[Tim Lister]], from their experience in the world of software development.  This book was revised in 2013.

==Overview==
''Peopleware'' is a popular book about software organization management. The first chapter of the book claims, "The major problems of our work are not so much ''technological'' as ''sociological'' in nature". The book approaches sociological or 'political' problems such as group chemistry and team jelling,  "[[Flow (psychology)|flow]] time" and quiet in the work environment, and the high cost of turnover.   Other topics include the conflicts between individual work perspective and corporate ideology, corporate entropy, "teamicide" and workspace theory.

The authors presented most subjects as principles backed up by some concrete story or other information. As an example, the chapter "Spaghetti Dinner" presents a fictional example of a manager inviting a new team over for dinner, then having them buy and prepare the meal as a group, in order to produce a first team success. Other chapters use real-life stories or cite various studies to illustrate the principles being presented.

==Editions==
*1st Edition: 1987
*2nd Edition: 1999
The second edition kept the original content with only a few changes or corrections. The bulk of the new content was in a new section at the end. The new section's chapters revisited some of the concepts of the original chapters with changes and added new ones.
The eBook PDF version published by DorsetHouse was not searchable as each page appeared to be an image.  The Kindle version is searchable.
*3rd Edition: 2013
The new content of the third edition is spread out through the book. There are new chapters, but the original content has also been updated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7367">'''Porter's four corners model''' is a predictive tool designed by [[Michael Porter]] that helps in determining a [[competitor]]'s course of action. Unlike other predictive models which predominantly rely on a firm's current [[strategy]] and capabilities to determine future strategy, Porter's model additionally calls for an understanding of what [[motivate]]s the competitor. This added dimension of understanding a competitor's internal culture, value system, mindset, and assumptions helps in determining a much more accurate and realistic reading of a competitor's possible reactions in a given situation.

== Four corners model==
;Motivation – drivers:
This helps in determining competitor's action by understanding their goals (both [[strategic]] and [[Military tactics|tactical]]) and their current position vis-à-vis their goals. A wide gap between the two could mean the competitor is highly likely to react to any external threat that comes in its way, whereas a narrower gap is likely to produce a defensive strategy. 
The question to be answered here is: What is it that drives the competitor? These drivers can be at various levels and dimensions and can provide insights into future goals.
 
;Motivation – management assumptions:
The [[perception]]s and [[:wikt:assumption|assumptions]] the competitor has about itself and its industry would shape strategy. This corner includes determining the competitor's perception of its strengths and weaknesses, organization culture and their beliefs about competitor's goals. If the competitor thinks highly of its competition and has a fair sense of industry forces, it is likely to be ready with plans to counter any threats to its position. On the other hand, a competitor who has a misplaced understanding of industry forces is not very likely to respond to a potential attack.
The question to be answered here is: What are competitor's assumption about the industry, the competition and its own capabilities?
   
;Actions – strategy:
A competitor's strategy determines how it competes in the market. However, there could be a difference between the company's intended strategy (as stated in the annual report and interviews) and its realized strategy (as is evident in its acquisitions, new product development, etc.). 
It is therefore important here to determine the competitor's realized strategy and how they are actually performing. If current strategy is yielding satisfactory results, it is safe to assume that the competitor is likely to continue to operate in the same way.
The questions to be answered here are: What is the competitor actually doing and how successful is it in implementing its current strategy? 

;Actions – capabilities:
This looks at a competitor's inherent ability to initiate or respond to external forces. Though it might have the [[motivation]] and the drive to initiate a strategic action, its effectiveness is dependent on its capabilities. 
Its strengths will also determine how the competitor is likely to respond to an external threat. An organization with an extensive distribution network is likely to initiate an attack through its channel, whereas a company with strong financials is likely to [[counter attack]] through price drops.
The questions to be answered here are: What are the strengths and weaknesses of the competitor? Which areas is the competitor strong in?

== Strengths==
;Considers implicit aspects of competitive behavior:
Firms are more often than not aware of their rivals and do have a generally good understanding of their strategies and capabilities. However,  motivational factors are often overlooked. Sufficiently motivated competitors can often prove to be more competitive than bigger but less motivated rivals. What sets this model apart from others is its insistence on accounting for the "implicit" factors such as culture, history, executive, consultants, and board's backgrounds, goals, values and commitments and inclusion of management's deep beliefs and assumptions about what works or does not work in the market.&lt;ref name=academy&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100828230713/http://www.academyci.com/ftse/Competitive_Analysis_Training.html Competitive Analysis Training], [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] (SCIP)&lt;/ref&gt;  

;Predictive in nature:
Porter's four corners model provides a [[Conceptual framework|framework]] that ties competitor's capabilities to their assumptions of the competitive environment and their underlying motivations. Looking at both a firm's capabilities (what the firm can do) and underlying implicit factors (their motivations to follow a course of action) can help predict competitor's actions with a relatively higher level of confidence. The underlying assumption here is that decision makers in firms are essentially human and hence subject to the influences of affective and automatic processes described by [[neuroscientist]]s.&lt;ref name=academy /&gt; Hence by considering these factors along with a firm's capabilities, this model is a better predictor of competitive behavior.

== Use in competitive intelligence and strategy ==
Despite its strengths, Porter's four corners model is not widely used in strategy and competitive intelligence. In a 2005 survey by the [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]]'s (SCIP) frequently used analytical tools, Porter's four corners does not even figure in the top ten.&lt;ref&gt;[ State of the art: competitive intelligence], Research report 2005-2006 [[Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals]] (SCIP)&lt;/ref&gt;

However this model can be used in competitive analysis and strategy as follows:

'''Strategy development and testing''': Can be used to determine likely actions by competitors in response to the firm's strategy. This can be used when developing a strategy (such as for a new product launch) or to test this strategy using [[simulation]] techniques such as a [[Business war games|business war game]].

''''Early warning''':  The predictive nature of this tool can also alert firms to possible threats due to competitive action.

Porter's four corners also works well with other analytical models. For instance it complements [[Porter five forces analysis]] well. Competitive cluster analysis of industry products in turn complements four corners analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.exinfm.com/training/pdfiles/course12-2.pdf |title= Course 12: Competitive Intelligence (Part 2 of 2) |author= Matt H. Evans, CPA, CMA, CFM |publisher= Excellence in Financial Management }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using such models that complement each other can help create a more complete analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="865">'''Power push-over''' (Buntover) is the action of an aircraft, typically a [[gyroplane]], whose propeller thrust line is above the [[center of gravity]] and lacks an adequate horizontal stabilizer to pitch forward.

Power push-over is caused by the creation of a [[torque]] around the center of mass of the gyroplane by the force of the propeller and unloading of the rotor. Unloading of the rotor and subsequent power push-over can be caused by excessive pilot-induced oscillations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rotorcraft Flying Handbook|date=July 1, 2007|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uoJtGSmQYEC&amp;pg=PT417&amp;dq=Power+Push+over&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rwflVKuNIsL2yQTxu4CwAQ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Power%20Push%20over&amp;f=false|accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1630">'''Ragnar Kreuger''' (4 August 1897 &amp;ndash; 27 October 1997) was a [[Finnish people|Finnish]]  [[Industry|industrialist]] and amaterur [[ornithologist]].

From 1926 Kreuger acquired an engineering company, a construction firm, and electrical, now [[YIT]].
He started  [[Oology|birds egg-collecting]] as a little boy in the 1910s. In 1917 he bought his first Finnish private collection. He went on to collect birds eggs for more than 50 years. He acquired collections from across the globe. In 1962, he donated his collection of the [[University of Helsinki]], where it is maintained in the [[Finnish Museum of Natural History]] as Museum Oologicum R. Kreuger, but he continued to collect as a hobby, and to expand the collection even after the exchange and purchase of eggs was made illegal.

Kreuger was an avid [[hunter]]. He bought the island of Hättö in [[Ingå]] and introduced there a number of exotic plant and animal species. For instance, in 1939 he purchased [[Mouflon]] from Denmark. The animals were quarantined at the zoo then transferred to Hättö. The herd gradually began to increase and was in the late 1940s about 30 individuals.

'''Shareholder value''' is a business term, sometimes phrased as '''shareholder value maximization''' or as the '''shareholder value model''', which implies that the ultimate measure of a company's success is the extent to which it enriches shareholders. It became popular during the 1980s, and is particularly associated with former CEO of [[General Electric]], [[Jack Welch]].

The term can be used to refer to:
*The [[market capitalization]] of a company
*The concept that the primary goal for a company is to increase the [[wealth]] of its [[shareholders]] (owners) by paying dividends and/or causing the stock price to increase
*The more specific concept that planned actions by management and the returns to shareholders should outperform certain bench-marks such as the [[cost of capital]] concept. In essence, the idea that shareholders' money should be used to earn a higher return than they could earn themselves by investing in other assets having the same amount of [[risk]]. The term in this sense was introduced by [[Alfred Rappaport (economist)|Alfred Rappaport]] in 1986.

==Definition==
For a publicly traded company, Shareholder Value (SV) is the part of its capitalization that is [[Shareholders' equity|equity]] as opposed to long-term [[debt]]. In the case of only one type of [[stock]], this would roughly be the number of outstanding shares times current shareprice. Things like [[dividend]]s augment shareholder value while issuing of shares ([[stock options]]) lower it.
This '''shareholder value added''' should be compared to average/required increase in value, making reference to the [[cost of capital]].

For a privately held company, the value of the firm after debt must be estimated using one of several [[Valuation (finance)|valuation]] methods, s.a. [[discounted cash flow]] or others.

==History==
On August 12, 1981, [[Jack Welch]] made a speech at [[The Pierre]] in [[New York City]] called ‘Growing fast in a slow-growth economy’.&lt;ref&gt;Betsy Morris, [http://money.cnn.com/2006/07/10/magazines/fortune/rules.fortune/index.htm "Tearing up the Jack Welch playbook"] (July 11, 2006) ''Fortune'' at CNNmoney.com&lt;/ref&gt; This is often acknowledged as the "dawn" of the obsession with shareholder value. Welch's stated aim was to be the biggest or second biggest market player, and to return maximum value to stockholders.

In March 2009, Welch criticized parts of the application of this concept, calling a focus on shareholder quarterly profit and share price gains "the dumbest idea in the world".&lt;ref&gt;''Financial Times'' [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/294ff1f2-0f27-11de-ba10-0000779fd2ac,dwp_uuid=c770f55e-0fac-11de-a8ae-0000779fd2ac.html "Welch condemns share price focus"] (March 13, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Welch then elaborated on this, claiming that the quotes were taken out of context.&lt;ref&gt;''Business Week'' [http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2009/db20090316_630496.htm "Jack Welch Elaborates"] (March 16, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Mizruchi and Howard Kimeldorf offer an explanation of the rise in prominence of institutional investors and securities analysts as a function of the changing political economy throughout the late 20th century. The crux of their argument is based upon one main idea. The rise in prominence of institutional investors can be credited to three significant forces, namely organized labor, the state and the banks. The roles of these three forces shifted, or were abdicated, in an effort to keep corporate abuse in check. However, “without the internal discipline provided by the banks and external discipline provided by the state and labor, the corporate world has been left to the professionals who have the ability to manipulate the vital information about corporate performance on which investors depend”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mizruchi|first=Mark|author2=Howard Kimeldorf |title=The Historical Context of Shareholder Value Capitalism|journal=Political Power and Social Theory|volume=17|url= http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/dobbin/files/mizruchi2005a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed institutional investors and securities analysts from the outside to manipulate information for their own benefit rather than for that of the corporation as a whole.

Though Ashan and Kimeldorf (1990) admit that their analysis of what historically led to the shareholder value model is speculative, their work is well regarded and is built upon the works of some of the premier scholars in the field, namely Frank Dobbin and Dirk Zorn.

During the 1970s, there was an economic crisis caused by stagflation. The stock market had been flat for nearly 12 years and inflation levels had reached double-digits. Also, the Japanese had recently taken the spot as the dominant force in auto and high technology manufacturing, a title historically held by American companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dobbin|first=Frank|author2=Jiwook Jung |title=The Misapplication of Mr. Michael Jensen: How Agency Theory Brought Down the Economy and Why it Might Again|journal=Sociology of Organizations|volume=30B|url= http://scholar.harvard.edu/dobbin/files/the_misapplication_of_mr._michael_jensen_dobbin_and_jung.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, coupled with the economic changes noted by Mizruchi and Kimeldorf, brought about the question as to how to fix the current model of management.

Though there were contending solutions to resolve these problems, the winner was the Agency Theory developed by Jensen and Meckling, which will be discussed in greater detail later in this entry. As a result of the political and economic changes of the late 20th century, the balance of power in the economy began to shift. Today, “…power depends on the capacity of one group of business experts to alter the incentives of another, and on the capacity of one group to define the interests of another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dobbin|first=Frank|author2=Dirk Zorn |title=Corporate Malfeasance and the Myth of Shareholder Value|journal=Political Power and Social Theory|volume=17|url= http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1074562.files/Dobbin_Zorn_CorpMal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated earlier, what made the shift to the shareholder value model unique was the ability of those outside the firm to influence the perceived interests of corporate managers and shareholders.

However, Dobbin and Zorn argue that those outside the firm were not operating with malicious intentions. “They conned themselves first and foremost. Takeover specialists convinced themselves that they were ousting inept CEOs. Institutional investors convinced themselves that CEOs should be paid for performance. Analysts convinced themselves that forecasts were a better metric for judging stock price than current profits”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dobbin|first=Frank|author2=Dirk Zorn |title=Corporate Malfeasance and the Myth of Shareholder Value|journal=Political Power and Social Theory|volume=17|url= http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1074562.files/Dobbin_Zorn_CorpMal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, it was the political and economic landscape of the time that offered the perfect opportunity for professionals outside of firms to gain power and exert their influence in order to drastically change corporate strategy.

== Agency theory and shareholder value==
Agency theory is the study of problems characterized by disconnects between two cooperating parties: a principal and an agent.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen M. Eisenhardt, "Agency Theory: An Assessment and Review," The Academy of Management Review 14(1989)  58.&lt;/ref&gt;   Agency problems arise in situations where there is a division of labor, a physical or temporal disconnect separating the two parties, or when the principal hires an agent for specialized expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Susan P. Shapiro, "Agency Theory," Annual Review of Sociology 31(2005)  275.&lt;/ref&gt;   In these circumstances, the principal takes on the agent to delegate responsibility to him.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Jensen and William H. Meckling, "Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure," Journal of Financial Economics 3(1976)  308.&lt;/ref&gt;   Theorists have described the problem as one of “separation and control”:&lt;ref&gt;Jensen and Meckling, "Theory of the Firm," 310.&lt;/ref&gt;  agents cannot be monitored perfectly by the principal, so they may shirk their responsibilities or act out of sync with the principal’s goals.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenhardt, "Agency Theory," 61.&lt;/ref&gt;   The information gap and the misalignment of goals between the two parties results in agency costs,&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, "Agency Theory," 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  which are the sum of the costs to the principal of monitoring, the costs to the agent of bonding with the principal, and the residual loss due to the disconnect between the principal’s interests and agent’s decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen and Meckling, "Theory of the Firm," 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lastly, the shareholder value theory seeks to reform the governance of publicly owned firms in order to decrease the principal-agent information gap. The model calls for firms’ boards to be independent from their corporate executives, specifically, for the head of the board to be someone other than the CEO and for the board to be independently chosen.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, "Agency Theory," 269.&lt;/ref&gt;  An independent board can best objectively monitor CEO undertakings and risk.&lt;ref&gt;Dobbin and Jung, "The Misapplication of Mr. Michael Jensen," 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Shareholder value also argues in favor of increased financial transparency.  By making firms’ finances available to scrutiny, shareholders become more aware of the agent’s behavior and can make informed choices about with whom to invest.&lt;ref&gt;Dobbin, "The Rise of Shareholder Value," Sociology 25, Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maximizing shareholder value==
This management principle, also known under '''value based management''', states that management should first and foremost consider the interests of shareholders in its business actions. (Although the legal premise of a publicly traded company is that the executives are obligated to maximize the company's profit,&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell S. Kennerly, Esq., [http://www.litigationandtrial.com/2010/09/articles/series/special-comment/ebay-v-newmark-al-franken-was-right-corporations-are-legally-required-to-maximize-profits/ "eBay v. Newmark: Al Franken Was Right, Corporations Are Legally Required To Maximize Profits"] (September 13, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; this does not imply that executives are legally obligated to maximize shareholder value.)

The concept of maximizing shareholder value is usually highlighted in opposition to alleged examples of CEO's and other management actions which enrich themselves at the expense of shareholders. Examples of this include acquisitions which are dilutive to shareholders, that is, they may cause the combined company to have twice the profits for example but these might have to be split amongst three times the shareholders.

As shareholder value is difficult to influence directly by any manager, it is usually broken down in components, so called value drivers. A widely used model comprises 7 drivers of shareholder value,&lt;ref&gt;''Corporate Financial Strategy'', Ruth Bender, Keith Ward, 3rd edition, 2008, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; giving some guidance to managers:
* Revenue
* Operating Margin
* Cash Tax Rate
* Incremental Capital Expenditure
* Investment in Working Capital
* Cost of Capital
* Competitive Advantage Period

Looking at some of these elements also makes it clear that short term [[profit maximization]] does not necessarily increase shareholder value. Most notably, the competitive advantage period takes care of this: if a business sells sub-standard products to reduce cost and make a quick profit, it damages its reputation and therefore destroys competitive advantage in the future. The same holds true for businesses that neglect research or investment in motivated and well-trained employees. Shareholders, analysts and the media will usually find out about these issues and therefore reduce the price they are prepared to pay for shares of this business.  This more detailed concept therefore gets rid of some of the issues (though not all of them) typically associated with criticism of the shareholder value model.

Based on these seven components, all functions of a business plan and show how they influence shareholder value. A prominent tool for any department or function to prove its value are so called shareholder value maps that link their activities to one or several of these seven components. So, one can find "HR shareholder value maps", "R&amp;D shareholder value maps", and so on.

==Criticism==
{{See also|Corporate social responsibility}}
The sole concentration on shareholder value has been widely criticized,&lt;ref&gt;Tirole 2001; Aglietta and Reberioux, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; particularly after the [[late-2000s financial crisis]]. While  a focus on shareholder value can benefit the owners of a corporation financially, it does not provide a clear measure of social issues like [[employment]], [[natural environment|environmental]] issues, or [[ethics|ethical]] business practices. A management decision can maximize shareholder value while lowering the welfare of [[Third party beneficiary|third parties]]. Shareholder value coupled with short-termism has also been criticized as lowering the overall rate of economic growth due to reduced business capital accumulation.&lt;ref&gt;Masouros, Pavlos E., "Corporate Law and Economic Stagnation: How Shareholder Value and Short-termism Contribute to the Decline of the Western Economies" Eleven International Publishing. pp. 6-9&lt;/ref&gt;

It can also disadvantage other stakeholders such as customers.  For example, a company may, in the interests of enhancing shareholder value, cease to provide support for old, or even relatively new, products.

Additionally, short term focus on shareholder value can be detrimental to long term shareholder value; the expense of gimmicks that briefly boost a stocks value can have negative impacts on its long term value.

==Disadvantages of the shareholder value model==
Shareholder value may be detrimental to a company’s worth. When all of a company’s focus and strategy is concentrated on increasing share prices, the practice and ethics of the firm can become lost because of the following problems with the shareholder value model.

===Lack of transparency===
The value of the company’s share depends on how much profit they have made in a given time. In the shareholder value system, the firm’s main concern is getting the share value to be as high as possible. To do this, companies found ways to make it seem like they were making far more profit than they actually were. These strategies to make the company seem profitable were often fraudulent. When the companies’ reports of their own finances are untrue, there becomes a lack of transparency: investors and employees alike do not know what profit was actually made and what profit was born from fraudulent schemes.

An example of how a company can appear profitable to investors without actually being profitable is the use of subsidiary companies. The firm has one parent company for which they are concerned about the shareholder value, and the firm also has one or more smaller subsidiary companies that has no substance and is only used as facade. The smaller companies are made to lose money so that the parent company may gain money. Debt and profits can be transferred between companies in such a way that financial reports claim the parent company is making a profit when it’s actually nothing more than a scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Srivastava|first=Rajendra K |author2=Tasadduq A. Shervani |author3=Liam Fahey|title=Market-Based Assets and Shareholder Value: A Framework for Analysis|journal=Journal of Marketing|year=1998|volume=62|issue=1|pages=2–18|jstor=1251799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a disadvantage to companies and the market at large because it allows profit to be made without any successful business practice being conducted. The ethics of firms are compromised in the interest of increasing share value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hillman|first=Amy J.|last2=Keim|first2=Gerald D.|date=2001-02-01|title=Shareholder value, stakeholder management, and social issues: what's the bottom line?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0266(200101)22:23.0.CO;2-H/abstract|journal=Strategic Management Journal|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=125–139|doi=10.1002/1097-0266(200101)22:23.0.CO;2-H|issn=1097-0266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increased risk===
In the shareholder value model, companies often take on much more risk than they otherwise would. The acquisition of debt makes the company unstable and at risk of [[bankruptcy]]. Plentiful debt is conducive to increasing share value because the company has greater potential to increase value when starting at a lower baseline. This however is a detrimental to the stability of the company.

Debt financing, or the purposeful acquisition of debt, causes the debt to equity ratio of the company to rise. Without shareholder value, this would normally be considered negative because it means that the company is not making money. In the shareholder value system, high debt to equity ratios are considered an indicator that the company has confidence to make money in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lazonick|first=William|author2=Mary O'Sullivan|title=Maximizing shareholder value: a new ideology for corporate governance|journal=Economy and Society|date=2 December 2010|volume=29|issue=1|pages=13–35|doi=10.1080/030851400360541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, debt is not something to avoid but rather something to embrace and having debt will actually gain the company investors. Taking on large risk attracts investors and increases potential value gain, but puts the company in danger of bankruptcy and collapse.

===Short term strategy===
When companies use the shareholder value model, firm behavior is focused on increasing the shareholder value rather than the long-term success of the company. Because employees are given stock options instead of salaries, it is in their interest for the share value to go up. In order for it to go up repeatedly, a strategy would be to allow the share price to alternate rising and falling. After the value has fallen, the amount of increase can be maximized. This type of oscillation is not beneficial to the long-term success of the company. Repeatedly decreasing share value so that it can be again increased generates profit for shareholders, but does not generate profit for the company; instead the company could become stagnant and fragile. Short-term strategies to increase share value are beneficial to investors and employees with stock options but are a disadvantage to sustained success of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rappaport|first=Alfred|title=Creating Shareholder Value: A guide for managers and investors|year=1998|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York|pages=13–29|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=bc0PjplGR5gC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=shareholder+value&amp;ots=R6Pn_VIVFY&amp;sig=cAz65l7Ees9wj2eJ6GR34GF2faM#v=onepage&amp;q=shareholder%20value&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
While shareholder value is the most common framework for measuring a company's success and financial viability, a number of alternatives have been proposed. Indeed, maximizing shareholder value is not always the goal of successful companies.

===Stakeholder value===
The broad idea of "stakeholder value" is the most common basis of alternative frameworks. The intrinsic or extrinsic worth of a business measured by a combination of financial success, usefulness to society, and satisfaction of employees, the priorities determined by the makeup of the individuals and entities that together own the shares and direct the company. This is sometimes referred to as stakeholder value. Stakeholder value heavily relies on [[corporate social responsibility]] and long-term financial stability as a core business strategy.&lt;ref name="Griaud et al"/&gt;

The stakeholder value model is prevalent in regions where [[limited liability]] laws are not strong. Some companies, choosing to prioritize social responsibility, elect to prioritize the social and financial welfare of employees and suppliers over shareholders; this, in turn, shields shareholders, the owners of the company, from liability when the law would not be lenient should the company engage in poor behavior.&lt;ref name="Griaud et al"&gt;[http://www.essec.edu/faculty/showDeclFileRes.do?declId=10089&amp;key=__workpaper__ "In Search of an alternative to Shareholder Value Maximization"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713130814/http://www.essec.edu/faculty/showDeclFileRes.do?declId=10089&amp;key=__workpaper__ |date=2015-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its high potential social benefit, this concept is difficult to implement in practice because of the difficulty of determining equivalent measures for usefulness to society and satisfaction of employees.  For instance, how much additional "usefulness to society" should shareholders expect if they were to give up $100 million in shareholder return?  In response to this criticism, defenders of the stakeholder value concept argue that employee satisfaction and usefulness to society will ultimately translate into shareholder value.

Another related criticism is that it is difficult to determine how to equitably distribute value to stakeholders. The question of "who deserves what and how much" is a difficult one to answer.

===Social enterprise===
A company may choose to disregard shareholders completely. A [[social enterprise]] instead focuses its objectives on goals other than the profitability of its owners; indeed, the legal body of a social enterprise often precludes issuing dividends to shareholders. Social enterprises require significant investment in financial stability and long-term profitability, in the meantime taking very little risk.&lt;ref name="Griaud et al"/&gt;

Social enterprises manifest themselves in the UK as [[community interest company|community interest companies]] or [[Private company limited by guarantee|limited by guarantee]]. In the United States, California allows companies to incorporate as [[flexible purpose corporation]]s.&lt;ref name="Griaud et al"/&gt;

{{Japanese name| Iwanami}}
{{nihongo|'''Shigeo Iwanami'''|岩波茂雄|Iwanami Shigeo|extra=27 August 1881 – 25 April 1946}} was a publisher in the early [[Shōwa period]] [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], and founder of [[Iwanami Shoten]].

==Biography==
Iwanami was born in what is now part of [[Suwa, Nagano]], into a farming family. His father was a village headman, but he died when Iwanami was age 15, and Iwanami was raised by his mother. With the assistance of Shigetake Sugiura, he completed high school in [[Tokyo]]. A friend of [[Misao Fujimura]], he was so overcome by the latter’s suicide that he withdrew to a mountain hut at [[Lake Nojiri]] for 49 days, contemplating suicide himself, until his mother came to get him.

Iwanami entered [[Tokyo Imperial University]] in 1905, where he became interested in the teachings of [[Uchimura Kanzō]], although he never converted to Christianity. He married in 1906, and graduated from the Department of Philosophy in 1908. After graduation, Iwanami worked as an instructor at the Kanda Upper Women’s School, and at the Tokyo Women's School of Gymnastics and Music. Inspired by [[Leo Tolstoy]], Iwanami was convinced that women need to receive an education equal to that of men. Also, during this period, he established a literary circle with his close friend, [[Yoshishige Abe]] and held weekly meetings in his home with leading authors to discuss intellectual matters.&lt;ref name=Hardacre&gt;''New Directions in the Study of Meiji Japan'', page 148-150&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1913, Iwanami opened a used book store and publishing house, [[Iwanami Shoten]], in [[Jinbōchō, Tokyo]], with the idea that he could use this as a start to begin publishing and disseminating works which he felt to be of intellectual value, and quit his teaching job to devote his full energy into the venture. The following year, he assisted [[Natsume Sōseki]] in publishing ''[[Kokoro]]'', launching both Natsume’s career as a novelist and his own career as a publisher. Even after Natsume Sōseki died in 1916, ongoing revenues from the publication of his works provided Iwanami with the funding necessary to proceed with numerous projects. This included the translation into Japanese and publication of the works of most European philosophers of the 19th and early 20th centuries, including [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref name=Hardacre/&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s, Iwanami concentrated on publishing both scientific works and works of philosophy, as well as attempting to popularize the Japanese classics and new authors, calling his selection the “Iwanami Culture”. He also published a paperback series in order to make his prices affordable to students.&lt;ref name=Hardacre/&gt; From late 1927 to early 1928, he toured [[Manchuria]] and [[north China]] as a guest of the [[South Manchurian Railway]], together with [[Kiyoshi Miki]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Townsend  | first =  Susan | coauthors = | year = 2009| title = Miki Kiyoshi, 1897-1945: Japan's Itinerant Philosopher| publisher =  Brill | location = | isbn = 9004175822 - }} pages 222-224&lt;/ref&gt; During the interwar period, Iwanami developed such close ties with academics in Kyoto and Tokyo that his company enjoyed an almost complete monopoly on academic publishing in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Buckley  | first =  Sandra | coauthors = | year = 2006| title = Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Japanese Culture| publisher =  Routledge | location = | isbn = 0415143446 }} pages 222-224&lt;/ref&gt; However, he drew the wrath of Japanese militarists by publicly denouncing the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] as “a war Japan should not be involved in,” and in 1940 he drew unfavorable attention again by publishing works by [[Sokichi Tsuda]] that questioned the veracity of Japan’s historical antecedents as described in the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]''. Iwanami was arrested in 1942, but acquitted in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sakamoto  | first =  Taro | coauthors = | year = 2011| title = The Six National Histories of Japan| publisher =  UBC Press | location = | isbn = 0774842962 }} pages xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;

Iwanami was appointed to a seat in the [[House of Peers (Japan)|House of Peers]] in the [[Diet of Japan]] in 1945, as one of the highest taxpayers in Japan. He was awarded the [[Order of Culture]] by the Japanese government in 1946.  He died of an [[intracranial hemorrhage]] in July that year. His grave is at the temple of [[Tokei-ji]] in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].

'''NurShahila binti Amir Amzah''' (born 13 August 1990), known as '''Shila Amzah''' is a Malaysian singer-songwriter. One of the world's leading contemporary female recording artists in Asia, Shila is the first Malay artist to break through the Chinese music market.

Born and raised in [[Kuala Lumpur]], she began going to [[recording studio]]s at the age of 4 with her father and recorded a pop studio album five years later. With the help of a famous Malaysian record producer, in 2005 Shila released her second pop studio album, ''Sha-Hila''. Her single "Patah Seribu" (2011) received Pop Song of the Year and Song of the Year at the [[Malaysian Music Awards|19th Malaysian Music Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Patah Seribu membawa tuah kepada Shila Amzah|url = http://www.astroawani.com/berita-hiburan/patah-seribu-membawa-tuah-kepada-shila-amzah-1091|website = www.astroawani.com|publisher = Astro Awani|accessdate =3 December 2015|language = Malay|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151208110011/http://www.astroawani.com/berita-hiburan/patah-seribu-membawa-tuah-kepada-shila-amzah-1091|archivedate =8 December 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wworld.asia/2016/07/05/shila-amzah-conquering-music-fashion-world/|title=Shila Amzah On Conquering the Music and Fashion World|last=Yunus|first=Shaufik|date=5 July 2016|website=Wworld Asia Malaysia Online Magazine|publisher=|access-date= 5 August 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820234918/http://wworld.asia/2016/07/05/shila-amzah-conquering-music-fashion-world/|archivedate=20 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tay Za''' ({{IPA-my|tèza̰|IPA}}; {{lang-my|တေဇ}}, {{IPA-my|tèza̰|pron}}; also spelled '''Tayza''' or '''Teza'''; born 18 July 1964) is a Burmese business tycoon and the Chairman of [[Htoo Group of Companies]], [[Myanmar]]. He is a close associate of the country's former head of state, [[Than Shwe]]. He is the first Myanmar entrepreneur to appear on the cover of [[Forbes Asia]].&lt;ref name="san"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/burma.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130129110402/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/d/burma.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=29 January 2013|title=CONSOLIDATED LIST OF FINANCIAL SANCTIONS TARGETS IN THE UK|date=20 April 2011|work=Her Majesty's Treasury|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2011/1010/feature-people-burma-showy-crony-capitalism-luxury-za-montlake.html|title=Burma's Showy Crony|last=Montlake|first=Simon|date=28 September 2011|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born on 18 July 1964 in [[Yangon]]. His father, Myint Swe (deceased), was a retired lieutenant colonel at the Ministry of Industry.&lt;ref name="fo"/&gt; He is the youngest of six siblings. He passed 10th standard at TTC of Yangon in 1982. He attended the [[Defence Services Academy]], as part of the 1982 intake, but dropped out during his third year to marry Thida Zaw (daughter of U Zaw and Daw Htoo of [[Gyobingauk]]), against the wishes of both families.&lt;ref name="fo"/&gt;

==Business holdings==
His major business interests include [[Htoo Group of Companies|Htoo Group]] and [[Air Bagan]], the country's first and only fully privately owned airline.&lt;ref name="moneymen"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=14151 |title=Money Men |date=September 2008 |publisher=The Irrawaddy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217174457/http://www.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=14151 |archivedate=February 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006–2007, Htoo Trading, a division of Htoo Holdings involved in [[teak]] log exports, was Burma's top private exporter and fifth largest overall, with gross revenues of $65.1 million.&lt;ref name=gas&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no369/b004.htm |title=Govt dominates foreign trade as gas sales pump up exports |publisher=The Myanmar Times |date=4–10 June 2007 |author=Ye Lwin and Kyaw Thu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209115127/http://www.mmtimes.com/no369/b004.htm |archivedate=February 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his career in the 1980s and started Htoo Group in the early 1990s to extract [[timber]] from Burma's forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/690f437c-b8dc-11e0-bd87-00144feabdc0.html|title=How sanctions made Burma’s richest man|date=12 August 2011|work=Financial Times|accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other activities include construction, [[tourism]], [[infrastructure]] projects, and [[mobile phone]] services. He enters into banking business and sets up [[Asia Green Development Bank]] when a license was granted by military junta in 2010 before giving up its power after [[Burmese general election, 2010|general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Four Businessmen Granted Private Bank License|url=http://www2.irrawaddy.org/article.php?art_id=18587|website=http://www2.irrawaddy.org|publisher=(31 May 2010)|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His bank was sanctioned by US Government soon after it was established. But it was removed from sanction list in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burma Sanctions|url=http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/pages/burma.aspx|website=http://www.treasury.gov|publisher=U.S. Department of the Treasury|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an arms broker for [[State Peace and Development Council|ex-military regime]], helping to buy military hardware from [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yan Pai|title=Burma and Russia to Increase Military Cooperation|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/burma-russia-increase-military-cooperation.html|accessdate=21 November 2013|newspaper=The Irrawaddy|date=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tay Za's airline Air Bagan is the main sponsor of [[Yangon United Football Club]], one of the nine professional football clubs in Myanmar competing for the [[Myanmar National League]] (MNL) title. His son is chairman of the club.

== Sanctions ==
In 2007, following protests against the junta on the streets of many cities in Burma, the United States government imposed sanctions against Tay Za and the companies he controls, including Htoo Trading and Air Bagan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/10/20071019-12.html Executive Order: Blocking Property and Prohibiting Certain Transactions Related to Burma&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp807.aspx| title=HP-807: Treasury Action Targets Financial Network of Burmese Tycoon and Regime Henchman Tay Za | publisher=US Department of Treasury | date=2008-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 2010, his son, Pye Phyo Tay Za, lost a legal battle to overturn [[European Union]] sanctions against him at the [[Council of the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.burmanet.org/news/2010/07/08/irrawaddy-eu-sanctions-on-tay-zas-son-upheld-%E2%80%93-simon-roughneen/|title=EU Sanctions on Tay Za's Son Upheld|last=Roughneen|first=Simon|date=8 July 2010|work=The Irrawaddy|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, the [[European Court of Justice]] ruled that Pye Phyo Tay Za be allowed to regain access to his accounts in Europe, as he had testified that he was not connected to his father's business interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2012/03/13/44657.htm|title=Myanmar Man Regains Access to Frozen Funds|last=Dotinga|first=William|date=13 March 2012|work=Courthouse News Service|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2016, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] implemented termination of the Burma Sanctions Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/burma_fact_sheet_20161007.pdf|title=TREASURY IMPLEMENTS TERMINATION OF BURMA SANCTIONS PROGRAM|date=7 October 2016|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in accordance with the Executive Order issued on the same date by the U.S President [[Barack Obama]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/Programs/Documents/burma_eo_termination.pdf|title=TERMINATION OF EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTIONS AND POLICIES OF THE GOVERNMENT OF BURMA|date=7 October 2016|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which effectively removed Tay Za, along with other Business Tycoons from [[OFAC]]'s [[Specially Designated Nationals]] list.

== Reputation ==
''Forbes'' noted that "[Tay Za] has a reputation as a generous boss who instills loyalty in 40,000 full-time staffers. Hundreds of employees have gone overseas to study, including Burma’s first female pilot, and perks quickly accrue to hardworking managers." &lt;ref name="fo"/&gt;

== Charity work ==
Tay Za established [[Htoo Foundation]] on 5 May 2008, after [[Cyclone Nargis]] devastated the [[Ayeyarwady Region]] and along with his group of companies provided emergency relief supplies to the survivors in [[Bogalay Township]], spending over US$8 million for the reconstruction of schools, hospitals, monasteries and government offices in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://htoo.com/about-us/htoo-foundation/|title=HTOO Foundation of HTOO Group of Companies|date=5 May 2008|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://htoofoundation.org/|title=HTOO Foundation Homepage|date=5 May 2008|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==

On 4 November, 2017, Al Ibrahim was detained in [[Saudi Arabia]] in a "corruption crackdown" conducted by a new royal anti-corruption committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/saudi-ministers-national-guard-economy-dismissed-171104190619900.html|title=Saudi Arabia princes detained, ministers dismissed|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arrests/saudi-billionaire-prince-alwaleed-detained-in-corruption-inquiry-idUSKBN1D506P|title=Future Saudi king tightens grip on power with arrests including Prince Alwaleed|last=Kalin|first=Stephen|last2=Paul|first2=Katie|date=2017-11-05|website=[[Reuters]]|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/5636723881001/|title=Corruption crackdown in Saudi Arabia|last=|first=|date=2017-11-06|website=[[Fox Business]]|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/04/billionaire-saudi-prince-alwaleed-bin-talal-arrested-in-corruption-crackdown-local-reports.html|title=Billionaire Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal arrested in corruption crackdown|last=David|first=Javier E.|date=5 November 2017|website=[[cnbc]]|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-princes-former-ministers-arrested-in-apparent-power-consolidation-1509837798|title=Saudi Princes, Former Ministers Arrested in Apparent Power Consolidation|last=Stancati|first=Margherita|date=2017-11-05|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=2017-11-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=Said|first2=Summer|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660|last3=Farrell|first3=Maureen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/04/world/middleeast/saudi-arabia-waleed-bin-talal.html|title=Saudi Arabia Arrests 11 Princes, Including Billionaire Alwaleed bin Talal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David D.|date=2017-11-04|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2017-11-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done on authority of Crown Prince [[Mohammad bin Salman]]. He was held at Riyadh’s Ritz-Carlton hotel.

Over the weekend of 26-27 January 2018, Al Ibrahim was released along with at least half a dozen other prominent Saudi businessmen detained in the probe, after being found innocent of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-arrests-mbc/chairman-of-saudi-media-group-mbc-allowed-to-travel-to-dubai-idUSL5N1SZ25S|title=Chairman of Saudi media group MBC allowed to travel to Dubai|last=Paul|first=Katie|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Saudi Arabian authorities allowed Al Ibrahim to leave the Kingdom for the first time since November to chair a strategy meeting at the headquarters of MBC Group in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Al Ibrahim was required to remain inside the Kingdom as the government finalised arrangements to take a controlling 60 percent stake in MBC.

Following the meeting, MBC Group released a statement, with Al Ibrahim quoted as saying: “The coming stage shall witness MBC Group’s entry into new markets and sectors, in various fields, with the group shifting a greater focus towards Saudi Arabia and neighbouring regions, in line with the current transformational positive changes occurring in the Kingdom.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/saudi-arrests-mbc/chairman-of-saudi-media-group-mbc-allowed-to-travel-to-dubai-idUSL5N1SZ25S|title=Chairman of Saudi media group MBC allowed to travel to Dubai|last=Paul|first=Katie|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business activities==

===ARAvision===
After completing his university education, al Ibrahim founded ARA Productions and Television Studios (ARAvision) in Saudi Arabia. It was his first enterprise in media.&lt;ref name=arabianbusi/&gt; Later, it was called ARA Group International, becoming a media conglomerate that is made up of several radio and television companies airing the whole Arab world.&lt;ref name=mfandy&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mamoun Fandy|title=Saudi Opposition between Globalization and Localization|journal=Comparative Studies in Society and History|date=January 1999|volume=41|issue=1|pages=124–147|jstor=179251|doi=10.1017/s0010417599001899}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His company, ARAvision, was registered in [[Riyadh]] in 1995. The company was provided with an exclusive licence to deliver a wireless cable service to major cities in the Kingdom. Therefore, it was able to screen the satellite channels' content before being broadcast.&lt;ref name=sakr&gt;{{cite journal|author=Naomi Sakr|title=Whys and wherefores of satellite channel ownership|journal=Satellite Realms: Transnational Television, Globalization and the Middle East|year=2001|url=http://acc.teachmideast.org/texts.php?module_id=13&amp;reading_id=1029&amp;sequence=3|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East Broadcasting Company (MBC)===
Al Ibrahim founded MBC in [[London]] in 1991 with another entrepreneur, [[Saleh Kamal]], launching the first independent Arabic satellite TV station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The money factories: the making of the new media barons|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+money+factories%3a+the+making+of+the+new+media+barons.-a018920882|accessdate=11 June 2013|work=Video Age International|date=1 October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the channel was directly linked to [[King Fahd]] himself through him. Waleed al Ibrahim was still in his twenties when he founded MBC.&lt;ref name=sakr/&gt; MBC is part of ARAvision.&lt;ref name=mfandy/&gt; MBC acquired [[United Press International]] that was bankrupt at that time for $3.95 million in 1992 to bolster its news-gathering scope.&lt;ref name=nyt92&gt;{{cite news|author=Youssef M. Ibrahim|title=Saudis Pursue Media Acquisitions, Gaining Influence in the Arab World|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/29/business/media-business-saudis-pursue-media-acquisitions-gaining-influence-arab-world.html?src=pm|accessdate=4 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 June 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the station introduced several movie and Arabic TV series channels including MBC 2, MBC 3 and MBC 4. Recently, two more channels were launched. One of them is MBC Persia, broadcasting [[Hollywood films]] with [[Persian Language|Persian]] subtitles, and the other one is MBC Action, airing action movies&lt;ref name=arabianbusi/&gt;&lt;ref name=sakr/&gt; and MBC Bollywood in 2013.

Al Ibrahim also launched [[Al Arabiya]] in February 2003 with the aim of providing an alternative to [[Al Jazeera]]. He stated his goal for Al Arabiya was to position it as the [[CNN]] to Al Jazeera's [[Fox News]]. Through this position, Al Arabiya was thought to be a TV channel that is calm, cool, professional, providing objective reporting rather than for extremely emphasized opinions.&lt;ref name=thenewy/&gt;

Although Al Ibrahim is widely known as the owner of the MBC, it is reported that fifty percent of the MBC profits are owned by late King Fahd's youngest son and his nephew, [[Abdul Aziz bin Fahd|Abdulaziz bin Fahd]]. It is further reported that Prince Abdulaziz deals with both the profits and ideology of MBC Channels, including [[Al Arabiya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ideological and Ownership Trends in the Saudi Media|url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09RIYADH651|work=Cablegate|accessdate=1 May 2012|date=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
In the 1990s Al Ibrahim was shareholder and board member of [[United Press International|the United Press International]] (UPI).&lt;ref name=edpu&gt;{{cite journal|author=Allan Wolper|title=UPI Looks for Way out of Massive Debt|url=http://www.downhold.org/lowry/ep.html|journal=Editor &amp; Publisher|date=24 April 1999|page=8|accessdate=1 September 2013}}{{Subscription required|via=Questia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as the chairman of the UPI board until the early 1999.&lt;ref name=edpu/&gt;

===Family investments===
In 1990, the wealth of his brothers, Abdulaziz Al Ibrahim and Khalid Al Ibrahim, was reported to have been US$1.0 billion.&lt;ref name=cnnfortune&gt;{{cite news|title=The billionaires 1990|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1990/09/10/73983/|accessdate=15 August 2012|work=CNN/Fortune|date=10 September 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was argued that they made their wealth through being [[Boeing]] and [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] representatives in Saudi deals.&lt;ref name=cnnfortune/&gt; Their wealth was reported to have been US$1.2 billion in 1991.&lt;ref name=bil1991/&gt; They had real estate investments in the US, including [[Marina del Rey]] in [[Los Angeles]], a property near [[Disney World]], and a hotel next to the [[Mayo Clinic]].&lt;ref name=bil1991/&gt; They also invested in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] real estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Coll|title=We all worship the same God October 1984 to February 1985|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/31/books/20080401_COLL_EXCERPT.html?pagewanted=print|accessdate=13 May 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=31 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
