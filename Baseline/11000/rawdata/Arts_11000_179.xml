'''''Adoration of the Christ Child''''' (Italian: ''Adorazione del Bambino''), is a circa 1619&amp;ndash;1621 [[Oil painting|oil on canvas]] painting of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity]] by the [[Dutch Golden Age]] artist [[Gerard Honthorst]] in the collection of the [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/240573 painting record] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
The Adoration of the Child shows a moonlit scene with Mary laying the Child in swaddling clothes. Joseph is looking over her shoulder and two angels are leaning over the crib. The moonlight is reflected off the faces in such a way that suggests the Child as a light source. The composition is reminiscent of much earlier versions, such as the 1490 ''[[Nativity at Night]]'' by [[Geertgen tot Sint Jans]]. The "Child as light source" aspect was used again and further exaggerated by Honthorst the next year when he painted the same subject, today held by the [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Provenance==
This painting is one of five paintings by Honthorst in the Uffizi, and all of them feature a [[tenebrist]] style that shows why the Italians call him ''Gherardo delle Notti'' or "Gerard of the Night".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polomuseale.firenze.it/inv1890/scheda.asp?position=1&amp;ninv=739 739] in Florentine museum&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably these were all purchased in 1628 by [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], who had just returned from a trip to Northern Europe and sent an intermediary to inquire after "6 paintings" that were for sale in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/42718380 Florentijnsche Gegevens II] by J.A.F.

'''Aline Bernstein''' (December 22, 1880 – September 7, 1955) was an American set designer and [[costume designer]]. She and [[Irene Lewisohn]] founded the [[Museum of Costume Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1944 |publisher=[[Playbill]] |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/68652.html |accessdate=December 16, 2008 |quote=Philanthropist Irene Lewisohn died today in New York City. She and her sister Alice built and endowed the Neighborhood Playhouse. With Aline Bernstein she founded the Museum of Costume Art on Fifth Avenue in 1937 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090408051558/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/68652.html |archivedate=April 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bernstein was the lover, patron, and muse of novelist [[Thomas Wolfe]].&lt;ref name=UNC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.uncpress.org/book/9780807841174/my-other-loneliness/ |title=My Other Loneliness [book description] |author= |date= |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |accessdate=November 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
She was born in 1880 in New York City, the daughter of Rebecca (Goldsmith) and Joseph Frankau, an actor. Joseph was a cousin of London cigar importer [[Arthur Frankau]] and thus, by marriage, of novelist and art historian [[Julia Frankau|Frank Danby]], whom Aline recalled visiting as a child when Joseph Frankau was performing in London.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Aline (1941) ''An Actor's Daughter'', A. A. Knopf – Ch. 7 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Her family was Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/bernstein-aline&lt;/ref&gt; By the time she was 17, both of her parents had died and she was raised by her aunt, Rachel Goldsmith. Goldsmith had a theatrical boarding house on West 44th Street in New York City.

==Career==
[[File:Wish-To-Be-Alone-Grand-Hotel-1930.jpg|thumb|One of Bernstein's set designs for the original Broadway production of ''Grand Hotel'' (1930)]]
[[File:The-Children's-Hour-1935-1.jpg|thumb|Bernstein's setting for the original Broadway production of ''[[The Children's Hour (play)|The Children's Hour]]'' (1934)]]
Between 1916 and 1951, Bernstein would do set design, costuming, or both for 51 productions.&lt;ref name ="IBDB"/&gt;

Bernstein was a theater set and costume designer for the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] on the Lower East Side, volunteering her work to make her name.

In 1926 she struggled but prevailed in becoming the first female member of the designers union. This membership opened up opportunities for Broadway commissions. However, as a woman, she still found that it was much easier to find work as a costume designer rather than as a set designer.&lt;ref name="Essin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Essin|first1=Christin|title=Stage Designers in Early Twentieth-Century America: Artists, Activists, Cultural Critics|date=2012|publisher=Publshr|location=Loc|page=43| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0M-cNuICBMoC&amp;pgn=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her career ran in phases; early on, she focused largely on costume design. After about 14 years of work, in 1930, she was able to move into set design. For about a decade, she primarily did set design work, only to return to costume design again around 1940 for the final phase of her career.&lt;ref name ="IBDB"/&gt;

In the 1930s she also began to write, with two books published by [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], a highly respected publisher at that time.&lt;ref name="Essin" /&gt; She was personal friends with [[Alfred A. Knopf, Sr.|Arthur]] and [[Blanche Knopf]].&lt;ref name="marshall 229"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mauldin |first=Joanne Marshall |year=2007 |title=Thomas Wolfe: When Do the Atrocities Begin? |publisher=University of Tennessee Press |isbn=1-57233-494-0 |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first book, ''Three Blue Suits'', helped to more firmly establish her as a designer in New York. The book included a series of three stories in which three very different men wear the same blue serge suit. The details regarding how each man wears – or drags (the jacket on the floor) – his suit, reveal aspects of each man's character in subtle ways. A common trope among costume designer is that costumes, if they are good, should ultimately not be noticed. In contrast, the blue suit stories reveal Bernstein's ability to discern how critical details of costume evoke, and interact with, a character, and ultimately her skill as a costume designer at making this happen effectively.&lt;ref name= "Essin" /&gt;

Some of her publications include:
* "Three Blue Suits" (collection of short stories), 1933
* ''The Journey Down'' (over her relationship with Wolfe), Knopf, 1938
* ''Miss Condon'', Knopf, 1947
* ''An Actor's Daughter'' (memoir), 1940
* ''The Martha Washington Doll Book'', 1945
* ''Masterpieces of Women's Costume of the 18th and 19th Centuries'', 1959 (published posthumously)

In 1950, Aline Bernstein finally won some hard earned recognition. In 1949 she had designed costumes for the [[opera]] ''Regina''. The music and [[libretto]] were written [[Marc Blitzstein]] but based on the play ''[[The Little Foxes]]'' by [[Lillian Hellman]], a play for which Bernstein had previously designed costumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grout|first =Donald Jay|authorlink = Donald Jay Grout|author2=Hermine Weigel Williams|title=A Short History of Opera|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2003|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11958-5|page=742}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IBDB" /&gt; Although that production of ''Regina'' (it would be regularly revived in the 20th century) only ran for a month and a half, Bernstein won a [[Tony Award|Tony]] for her costume design in 1950.&lt;ref name="IBDB"&gt;{{cite web|title=Aline Bernstein|url=http://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/Aline-Bernstein-24670|website=Internet Broadway Database|publisher=The Broadway League, Inc.|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Aline married Theodore F.

===Relationship with Thomas Wolfe===

Wolfe immortalized Bernstein as the character Esther Jack in his novels ''[[Of Time and the River]]'', ''[[The Web and the Rock]]'', and ''[[You Can't Go Home Again]]''. Bernstein, in turn, centered her autobiographical novel ''The Journey Down'' around her affair with Wolfe.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Bernstein's and Wolfe's affair ended after a few years, but their friendship continued. One of Wolfe’s last phone calls, when he was dying of a brain tumor at age 37, was to tell Bernstein he loved her.&lt;ref name=UNC/&gt; At the time of Wolfe's death in 1938, Bernstein possessed some of Wolfe's unpublished manuscripts.&lt;ref name="marshall 229"/&gt;

In the 2016 biographical drama film ''[[Genius (2016 film)|Genius]]'', Bernstein was portrayed by [[Nicole Kidman]], while Wolfe was portrayed by [[Jude Law]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42754">{{Maya civilization}}
'''Ancient Maya art''' refers to the material arts of the [[Maya civilization]], an eastern and south-eastern [[Mesoamerica]]n culture that took shape in the course of the later [[Preclassic Maya|Preclassic Period]] (500 BCE to 200 CE). Its greatest artistic flowering occurred during the seven centuries of the {{C|Mayan Classic Period|Classic Period}} (c. 200 to 900 CE). Ancient Maya art then went through an extended Post-Classic phase before the upheavals of the sixteenth century destroyed courtly culture and put an end to the Mayan artistic tradition. Many regional styles existed, not always coinciding with the changing boundaries of Maya polities. [[Olmec]]s, [[Teotihuacan]] and [[Toltec]]s have all influenced Maya art. Traditional art forms have mainly survived in weaving and the design of peasant houses.

==Mayan art history==
Following the nineteenth and early-twentieth century publications on Maya art and archaeology by [[John Lloyd Stephens|Stephens]], [[Frederick Catherwood|Catherwood]], [[Alfred Maudslay|Maudslay]], [[Teoberto Maler|Maler]] and [[Désiré Charnay|Charnay]] that for the first time made available reliable drawings and photographs of major Classic Maya monuments, the 1913 publication of Herbert Spinden´s 'A Study of Maya Art' - now over a century ago - laid the foundation for all later developments of Maya art history (including iconography).&lt;ref&gt;Spinden 1975&lt;/ref&gt; The book gives an analytical treatment of themes and motifs, particularly the ubiquitous serpent and dragon motifs, and a review of the ´material arts´, such as the composition of temple facades, roof combs and mask panels. Spinden's chronological treatment of Maya art was later (1950) refined by the motif analysis of the architect and specialist in archaeological drawing, [[Tatiana Proskouriakoff]], in her book 'A Study of Classic Maya Sculpture'.&lt;ref&gt;Proskouriakoff 1950&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Kubler|Kubler's]] 1969 inventory of Maya iconography, containing a site-by-site treatment of 'commemorative' images and a topical treatment of ritual and mythical images (such as the 'triadic sign'), concluded a period of gradual increase of knowledge that was soon to be overshadowed by new developments.

Starting in the early 1970s, the historiography of the Mayan kingdoms - first of all Palenque - came to occupy the forefront. Art-historical interpretation joined the historical approach pioneered by Proskouriakoff as well as the mythological approach initiated by [[Michael D. Coe|M.D. Coe]], with a professor of art, Linda Schele, serving as a driving force. Schele's seminal interpretations of Maya art are found throughout her work, especially in ''The Blood of Kings'', written together with art historian [[Mary Miller (art historian)|M. Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Miller 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Maya art history was also spurred by the enormous increase in sculptural and ceramic imagery, due to extensive archaeological excavations, as well as to organized looting on an unprecedented scale. On from 1973, M.D. Coe published a series of books offering pictures and interpretations of unknown Maya vases, with the Popol Vuh Twin myth for an explanatory model.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1973, 1975, 1978, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Robicsek and Hales added an inventory and classification of Maya vases painted in codex style,&lt;ref&gt;Robicsek and Hales 1981&lt;/ref&gt; thereby revealing even more of a hitherto barely known spiritual world.

As to subsequent developments, important issues in Schele's iconographic work have been elaborated by [[Karl Taube]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Miller and Taube 1993; Taube et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; New approaches to Maya art include studies of ancient Maya ceramic workshops,&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet 1994&lt;/ref&gt; the representation of bodily experience and the senses in Maya art,&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and of hieroglyphs considered as iconographic units.&lt;ref name="Stone and Zender 2011"&gt;Stone and Zender 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the number of monographs devoted to the monumental art of specific courts is growing.&lt;ref&gt;Tate 1992, Looper 2003, Simmons Clancy 2009, O'Neil 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A good impression of recent Mexican and North American art historical scholarship can be gathered from the exhibition catalogue 'Courtly Art of the Ancient Maya' (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Miller and Martin 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
{{main|Maya architecture}}

[[File:Copan T11-2.jpg|thumb|Copan, 'Reviewing Stand' with simian musicians]] 
[[File:Labna-Palace-Vaulted-Passage.jpg|thumb|Labna, Palace, vaulted passage]]

The layout of the Maya towns and [[Maya city|cities]], and more particularly of the ceremonial centers where the royal families and courtiers resided, is characterized by the rhythm of immense horizontal stucco floors of plazas often located at various levels, connected by broad and often steep stairs, and surmounted by temple pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;Stierlin 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Under successive reigns, the main buildings were enlarged by adding new layers of fill and stucco coating. Irrigation channels, reservoirs, and drains made up the hydraulic infrastructure. Outside the ceremonial center (especially in the southern area sometimes resembling an [[acropolis]]) were the structures of lesser nobles, smaller temples, and individual shrines, surrounded by the wards of the commoners. Dam-like causeways ([[sacbe]]ob) spread from the 'ceremonial centers' to other nuclei of habitation. Fitting in with the concept of a '[[theatre state]]', more attention appears to have been given to aesthetics than to solidity of construction. Careful attention, however, was placed on directional orientation.

Among the various types of structures should be mentioned:
*Ceremonial platforms (usually less than 4 meters in height).
*Courtyards and palaces.
*Other residential buildings, such as a writers' house &lt;ref&gt;Coe and Kerr 1997: 100-101&lt;/ref&gt; and a possible council house in Copan.
*Temples and temple pyramids, the latter often containing burials in their base or fill, with sanctuaries on top. The outstanding example are the many clustered dynastic burial temples of Tikal's [[North Acropolis, Tikal|North Acropolis]].   
*[[Mesoamerican ball court|Ball courts]].
 
Among the structural ensembles are:
*'[[Triadic pyramid]]s' consisting of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform;
*'[[E-Group|E-groups]]' consisting of a square platform with a low four-stepped pyramid on the west side and an elongated structure, or, alternatively, three small structures, on the eastern side;
*'[[Twin pyramid complex]]es', with identical four-stepped pyramids on the east and west sides of a small plaza; a building with nine doorways on the south side; and a small enclosure on the north side housing a sculpted stela with its altar and commemorating the king's performance of a [[k'atun]]-ending ceremony.

In the palaces and temple rooms, the '[[corbelled vault]]' was often applied. Though not an effective means to increase interior space, as it required thick stone walls to support the high ceiling, some temples utilized repeated arches, or a corbelled vault, to construct an inner sanctuary (e.g., that of the Temple of the Cross at Palenque).

The northern Maya area (Campeche and Yucatan) shows characteristics of its own. Its Classic [[Puuc]], Chenes, and [[Rio Bec]] architecture&lt;ref&gt;Gendrop 1983&lt;/ref&gt; is characterized by the geometrical reduction of realistic decoration; the stacking of rain god snouts to build facades; the use of portals shaped like serpent mouths; and, in the Rio Bec area, the use of solid pseudo temple-pyramids. The most important Puuc site is [[Uxmal]]. [[Chichen Itza]], dominating Yucatan from the Late Classic to well into the Post-Classic, features Classic buildings in Chenes and Puuc style as well as Post-Classic building types of Mexican derivation, such as the radial four-staircase pyramid, the colonnaded hall, and the circular temple. The latter features were inherited by the succeeding kingdom of [[Mayapan]].

==Stone sculpture==
{{see also|Maya stelae}}
[[File:Cancuenpanel3.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Cancuen]], panel 3, seated king with two subordinates. Second half 8th century.]]
[[File:Stela A Copan 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|180px|Copan stela A, Maudslay cast]] 
The main Preclassic sculptural style from the Maya area is that of [[Izapa]], a large settlement on the Pacific coast where many stelas and (frog-shaped) altars were found showing motifs also present in [[Olmec]] art.&lt;ref&gt;Guernsey 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The stelas, mostly without inscriptions, often show mythological and narrative subjects, some of which appear to relate to the Twin myth of the [[Popol Vuh]]. Nonetheless, it remains uncertain if the inhabitants of Izapa were ethnically Mayan. For the Classic Period of the Mayas, the following major classes of stone sculpture may be distinguished.

*'''Stelas'''. These are large, elongated stone slabs usually covered with carvings and inscriptions, and often accompanied by round altars. Typical of the Classical period, most of them depict the rulers of the cities they were located in, often disguised as gods. Although the rulers' faces, particularly during the later Classic Period, are naturalistic in style, they usually do not show individual traits; but there are notable exceptions to this rule (e.g., [[Piedras Negras (Maya site)|Piedras Negras]], stela 35). The most famous stelas are from [[Copan]] and nearby [[Quirigua]]. These are outstanding for their intricateness of detail, those of Quirigua also for sheer height (stela E measuring over 7 metres above ground level and 3 below). Both the Copan and [[Tonina]] stelas approach sculptures in the round. From [[Palenque]], otherwise a true Maya capital of the arts, no significant stelae have been preserved.
*'''[[lintel (architecture)|Lintels]]''', spanning doorways or jambs. Particularly [[Yaxchilan]] is renowned for its long series of lintels in deep relief, some of the most famous of which show meetings with [[Maya religion|ancestors]] or, perhaps, local deities.&lt;ref&gt;Tate 1992&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Panels and tablets''', set in the walls and piers of buildings and the sides of platforms. Particularly [[Palenque]] is famous for the large tablets adorning the inner sanctuaries of the Cross Group temples, and for refined masterworks such as the 'Palace Tablet', the 'Tablet of the Slaves', and the multi-figure panels of the temple XIX and XXI platforms.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart and Stuart 2008&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Pakal]]'s carved sarcophagus lid - without equal in other Maya kingdoms - might also be included here.
*'''Altars''', rounded or rectangular, sometimes resting on three or four boulder-like legs. They may be wholly or partly figurative (e.g., Copan turtle altar) or have a relief image on top, sometimes consisting of a single ''[[Ajaw|Ahau]]'' day sign (Caracol, Tonina).&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000: 89&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Zoomorphs''', or large boulders sculpted to resemble living creatures and covered with highly complicated relief ornamentation. Zoomorphs seem to be restricted to the kingdom of [[Quirigua]] during the Late Classic period&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2003: 172-178, 186-192&lt;/ref&gt; and may have functioned as altars.
*'''Ball court markers''', or rounded relief carvings placed in the central axis of the floors of ball courts (such as those of Copan, [[Chinkultic]], Tonina), and usually showing royal ball game scenes. 
*'''Monumental stairs''', most famously the giant hieroglyphic stairway of Copan. The hewn stone blocks of hieroglyphic stairways together constitute an extensive text. Stairways can also be decorated with a great variety of scenes ([[La Corona]]), particularly the ball game. Sometimes, the ball game becomes the stairs' chief theme ([[Yaxchilan]]), with a captive depicted inside the ball, or, elsewhere ([[Tonina]]), a full-figure captive stretched out along the step.
*'''Thrones''', with a broad, square seat, and a back sometimes iconically shaped like the wall of a cave, and worked open to show human figures. Examples from Palenque and Copan have supports showing cosmologic carriers ([[Bacab]]s, [[Chaak]]s).
*'''Stone sculpture in the round''', represented by statuary, such as the seated Copan scribe and small stelas from Toniná; by certain figurative architectural elements, such as the maize deities from a Copan façade; and by giant sculptures such as the symmetrically-positioned jaguars and simian musicians of Copán, that were integral parts of architectural design.

==Wood carving==
[[File:WLA metmuseum Maya Wood Mirror Bearer 6th century.jpg|thumb|upright|120px|Possible mirror bearer, wood, 6th century]]
It is believed that carvings in wood were once extremely common, but only a few examples have survived. Most 16th-century wood carvings, considered objects of idolatry, were destroyed by the Spanish colonial authorities. The most important Classic examples consist of intricately worked lintels, mostly from the main [[Tikal]] pyramid sanctuaries,&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Coe et al. 1961&lt;/ref&gt; with one specimen from nearby [[El Zotz]]. The Tikal wood reliefs, each consisting of several beams, and dating to the 8th century, show a king on his seat with a protector figure looming large behind, in the form of a Teotihuacan-style 'war serpent' (Temple I lintel 2), a jaguar (Temple I lintel 3), or a human impersonator of the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar god of terrestrial fire]] (Temple IV lintel 2). Other Tikal lintels depict an obese king wearing a jaguar dress and standing in front of his seat (Temple III lintel 2); and most famously, a victorious king, dressed as an astral death god, and standing on a palanquin underneath an arching feathered serpent ([[Tikal Temple IV|Temple IV lintel 3]]). A rare utility object is a tiny lidded box covered with a long hieroglyphic inscription from [[Tortuguero (Maya site)| Tortuguero]]. Free sculpture in wood, dating back to the 6th century, is represented by a dignified seated man possibly functioning as a mirror bearer.

==Stucco modeling==
[[Image:PyramideDesMasquesKohunlich.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Stucco mask panels, Early Classic, Kohunlich]]
[[Image:K'inich Janaab Pakal I v2.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Stucco portrait of king [[Pakal]], Palenque]]
At least since Late Preclassic times, modeled and painted stucco plaster covered the floors and buildings of the town centers and provided the setting for their stone sculptures. Often, large mask panels with the plastered heads of deities in high relief (particularly those of sun, rain, and earth) are found attached to the sloping retaining walls of temple platforms flanking stairs (e.g., [[Kohunlich]]). Stucco modeling and relief work can also cover the entire building, as shown by Temple 16 of [[Copan]], in its 6th-century form (known as 'Rosalila'). Dedicated to the first king, [[Yax K'uk' Mo']], this early temple has preserved plastered and painted facades. The stuccoed friezes, walls, piers, and roof combs of the Late Preclassic and Classic periods show varying and sometimes symbolically complicated decorative programs.
 
Several solutions for dividing up and ordering the stuccoed surfaces of buildings were applied, serialization being one of them. The Early Classic walls of the 'Temple of the [[Maya jaguar gods#The Jaguar God of Terrestrial Fire and War ('Night Sun')|Night Sun]]' in [[El Zotz]] consist of a series of subtly varied deity mask panels, whereas the frieze of a [[Balamku]] palace, also from the Early Classic, originally had a series of four rulers enthroned above the open ophidian mouths of four different animals (a toad among them) associated with symbolic mountains. Conversely, friezes may be centered on a single ruler again sitting on a symbolic (maize) mountain, such as a frieze from [[Holmul]], with two feathered serpents emanating from below the ruler's seat, and another one from [[Xultun]], on which the ruler carries a large ceremonial bar with emerging jaguar-like figures.&lt;ref&gt;newmedia.ufm.edu/gsm/index.php/Saturnoxultun&lt;/ref&gt; An Early-Classic temple frieze from Placeres, Quintana Roo, has the large mask panel of a young lord or deity in the middle, with two lateral [[Mam (Maya mythology)|'Grandfather']] deities extending their arms.

Often, a frieze is divided into compartments. Late Preclassic friezes of [[El Mirador]], for example, show the intervening spaces of an undulating serpent's body filled out with aquatic birds, and the sections of an aquatic band with swimming figures.&lt;ref&gt;Doyle and Houston 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a Classic palace frieze in [[Acanceh]] is divided into panels holding different animal figures&lt;ref&gt;V.E. Miller 1991&lt;/ref&gt; reminiscent of [[wayob]], while a wall in [[Tonina]] has lozenge-shaped fields suggesting a scaffold and presenting continuous narrative scenes that relate to human sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;see Yadeun 1993:108-115&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastered temple roof combs are similar to some of the friezes above in that they usually show large representations of rulers, who may again be seated on a symbolic mountain, and also, as on Palenque's Temple of the Sun, set within a cosmological framework. Further examples of Classic stucco modeling include the piers of the Palenque Palace, embellished with a series of lords and ladies in ritual dress, and the 'baroque', Late-Classic [[Chenes]]-style stucco entrance, beset with naturalistic human figures, on the Acropolis (Str. 1) of [[Ek' Balam]].

Unique in Mesoamerica, Classic Period stucco modeling includes realistic portraiture of a quality equalling that of Roman ancestral portraits, with the lofty stucco heads of Palenque rulers and portraits of dignitaries from [[Tonina]] as outstanding examples. Some of these portrait heads were part of life-size stucco figures adorning temple crests.&lt;ref&gt;Martin and Grube 2000: 168&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait modeling recalls that of certain Jaina ceramic statuettes.

==Mural painting==
[[Image:Bonampak painting.jpg|thumbnail|left|300px|Bonampak mural, room 1, east wall: Musicians]]
[[File:SBmural.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|San Bartolo mural: The king as Hunahpu]]
Although, due to the humid climate of [[Central America]], relatively few Mayan paintings have survived to the present day integrally, important remnants have been found in nearly all major court residences. This is especially the case in substructures, hidden under later architectural additions. Mural paintings may show more or less repetitive motifs, such as the subtly varied flower symbols on walls of House E of the Palenque Palace; scenes of daily life, as in one of the buildings surrounding the central square of [[Calakmul]] and in a palace of Chilonche; or ritual scenes involving deities, as in the Post-Classic temple murals of Yucatán's and Belize's east coast ([[Tancah]], [[Tulum]], Santa Rita).&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1982; Gann 1900&lt;/ref&gt;

They may also evince a more narrative character, usually with hieroglyphic captions present. The colourful [[Bonampak]] murals, for example, dating from 790 AD, and extending over the walls and vaults of three adjacent rooms, show spectacular scenes of nobility, battle and sacrifice, as well as a group of ritual impersonators in the midst of a file of [[Maya music|musicians]].&lt;ref&gt;M.E. Miller 1986; M.E. Miller and Brittenham 2013&lt;/ref&gt; At [[San Bartolo (Maya site)|San Bartolo]], murals dating from 100 BCE relate to the myths of the [[Maya maize god]] and the hero twin [[Hunahpu]], and depict a double inthronization; antedating the Classic Period by several centuries, the style is already fully developed, with colours being subtle and muted as compared to those of Bonampak or Calakmul.&lt;ref&gt;Saturno et al. 2005; Taube et al. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Outside the Mayan area, in a ward of East-Central Mexican [[Cacaxtla]], murals painted in a predominantly Classic Mayan style, with often stark colors, have been found, such as a savage battle scene extending over 20 meters; two figures of Mayan lords standing on serpents; and an irrigated maize and cacao field visited by [[God L|the Maya merchant deity]].&lt;ref&gt;Lozoff Brittenham and Uriarte 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Wall painting also occurs on vault capstones, in tombs (e.g., [[Río Azul]]), and in caves (e.g., [[Naj Tunich]]),&lt;ref&gt;Stone 1995&lt;/ref&gt; usually executed in black on a whitened surface, at times with the additional use of red paint. Yucatec vault capstones often show a depiction of the enthroned [[god K|lightning deity]] (e.g., [[Ek' Balam]]).

A bright turquoise blue colour - '[[Maya Blue]]' - has survived through the centuries due to its unique chemical characteristics; this color is present in [[Bonampak]], [[Cacaxtla]], Jaina, [[El Tajín]], and even in some Colonial Convents. The use of Maya Blue survived until the 16th century, when the technique was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Reyes-Valerio 1993; Houston et al. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing and bookmaking==
{{main|Maya script|Maya codices}}
[[File:Mexico - Museo de antropologia - Livre maya.JPG|thumb|Madrid Codex]]
The Maya writing system consists of about 1000 distinct characters or hieroglyphs ('glyphs'), and like many ancient writing systems is a mixture of syllabic signs and [[logogram]]s. This script was in use from the 3rd century BCE until shortly after the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. As of now (2017), a considerable proportion of the characters has a reading, but their meaning and configuration as a text is not always understood. The books were folded and consisted of bark paper or leather leaves with an adhesive stucco layer on which to write; they were protected by jaguar skin covers or, perhaps, wooden boards.&lt;ref&gt;Coe and Kerr 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Since every diviner probably needed a book, there must have existed large numbers of them. Today, [[Maya codices|three codices]] (the [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]], [[Paris Codex|Paris]], and [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid]] codices), all of the Post-Classic period, are still in existence; the authenticity of a fourth one (the [[Grolier Codex]]) remains doubtful.&lt;ref&gt;Love 2017&lt;/ref&gt; They are largely of a divinatory and priestly nature, containing almanacs, astrological tables, and ritual programs; the Paris Codex also includes [[Katun (Maya calendar)|katun]]-prophecies. Great attention was paid to a harmonious balance of texts and (partly coloured) illustrations.

Besides the codical glyphs, there existed a cursive script of an often dynamic character, found in wall-paintings and on ceramics, and imitated in stone on panels from Palenque (such as the 'Tablet of the 96 glyphs'). Often, written captions are enclosed in square 'boxes' of various shapes within the representation. Wall paintings may also entirely consist of texts ([[Ek' Balam]], [[Naj Tunich]]), or, more rarely, contain astrological computations ([[Xultun]]); sometimes, written on a white stuccoed surface, and executed with particular care and elegance, these texts are like enlargements of book pages.
 
Hieroglyphs are ubiquitous and were written on every available surface, including the human body. The glyphs themselves are highly detailed, and particularly the [[logogram]]s are deceivingly realistic. As a matter of fact, from an art-historical point of view, they should also be viewed as art motifs, and ''vice versa''.&lt;ref name="Stone and Zender 2011"/&gt; Sculptors at Copan and Quirigua have consequently felt free to convert hieroglyphic elements and calendrical signs into animated, dramatic miniature scenes ('full figure glyphs').

==Ceramics and 'ceramic codex'==
{{main|Maya ceramics}}
[[File:Codex vase Collection Henry Law 154.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Codex style cylinder vessel, courtly ritual]]
[[File:Maya Reicher Mann.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jaina, nobleman]]
Unlike utility ceramics found in such large numbers among the debris of archaeological sites, most of the decorated pottery (cylinder vessels, lidded dishes, vases, bowls) once was '[[social currency]]' among the Maya nobility, and, preserved as heirlooms, also accompanied the nobles into their graves.&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet 1994: 72ff&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocratic tradition of gift-giving feasts&lt;ref&gt;Tozzer 1941: 92&lt;/ref&gt; and ceremonial visits, and the emulation that inevitably went with these exchanges, goes a long way towards explaining the high level of artistry reached in Classical times.

Made without a potter's wheel, decorated pottery was delicately painted, carved into relief, incised, or - chiefly during the Early Classic period - made with the Teotihuacan [[fresco]] technique of applying paint to a wet clay surface. The precious objects were manufactured in numerous workshops distributed over the Mayan kingdoms, some of the most famous being associated with the [[Chama (Maya site)|'Chama-style']], the [[Holmul#Holmul-style|'Holmul-style']], the so-called [[Motul de San Jose#Ik style ceramics|'Ik-style']]&lt;ref&gt;Just 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and, for carved pottery, the 'Chochola-style.'&lt;ref&gt;Tate 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Vase decoration shows great variation, including palace scenes, courtly ritual, mythology, divinatory glyphs, and even dynastical texts taken from chronicles, and plays a major role in reconstructing Classical Maya life and beliefs. Ceramic scenes and texts painted in black and red on a white underground, the equivalents of pages from the lost folding books, are referred to as being in 'codex style' (e.g., the so-called [[Princeton Vase]]). The hieroglyphical and pictural overlap with the three extant books is (at least up to now) relatively small.

Sculptural ceramic art includes [[censer|incense burners]] and hand or mold-made figurines sometimes used as ocarinas. The profusely decorated, elongated Classic incense burners from the kingdom of Palenque - evolved from Early-Classic models - show the modeled face of a deity (usually the [[Maya jaguar gods|jaguar deity of terrestrial fire]]) or of a king. The elaborate Post-Classic, mold-made effigy incense burners especially associated with [[Mayapan]] represent standing deities (or priestly deity impersonators) often carrying offerings.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1957; Milbrath 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Figurines, many of them mold-made, are often of an amazing liveliness and realism. Apart from deities, [[Maya religion#Animal persons|animal persons]], rulers and dwarfs, they show many other characters as well as scenes taken from daily life. Some of these figurines may have been used in rituals. The most impressive examples stem from [[Jaina Island]].

==Precious stone and other sculpted materials==
[[File:Palenque - Pakal - Grabbeigabe.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Jade belt assemblage with celt pendants, from the tomb of king [[Pakal]], Palenque]]
[[File:Placa de jade, Nebaj, museu Nacional d'Arqueologia i Etnologia, Guatemala.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Jade plaque from Nebaj]]
It is remarkable that the Maya, who had no metal tools, created many objects from a very thick and dense material, jade ([[jadeite]]), particularly all sorts of (royal) dress elements, such as [[Maya belt plaques|belt plaques]] - or celts - ear spools, pendants, and also masks. Celts (i.e., flat, celt-shaped ornaments) were sometimes engraved with a stela-like representation of the king (e.g., the Early-Classic 'Leyden Plate'). The best-known example of a mask is probably the death mask of the Palenque king [[Pakal]], covered with irregularly-shaped jade plaques and having eyes made from [[Nacre|mother-of-pearl]] and obsidian; another death mask, belonging to a Palenque queen, consists of malachite plaques. Similarly, certain cylindrical vases from Tikal have an outer layer of square jade discs. Many stone carvings had jade inlays.

Among other sculpted and engraved materials are flint, shell, and bone, often found in caches and burials. The so-called '[[eccentric flint]]s' are ceremonial objects of uncertain use, in their most elaborate forms of elongated shape with usually various heads extending on one or both sides, sometimes those of the [[God K|lightning deity]], but more often of an anthropomorphic lightning probably representing the [[Maya maize god|Tonsured Maize God]].&lt;ref&gt;Agurcia, Sheets, Taube 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Shell was worked into disks and other decorative elements showing human, possibly ancestral heads and deities; [[conch]] trumpets were similarly decorated.&lt;ref&gt;Finamore and Houston 2010: 124-131&lt;/ref&gt; Human and animal bones were decorated with incised symbols and scenes. A collection of small and modified, tubular bones from an 8th-century royal burial under [[Tikal Temple I]] contains some of the most subtle engravings known from the Maya, including several scenes with the [[Maya maize god|Tonsured maize god]] in a canoe.&lt;ref&gt;Trik 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied arts and body decoration==
{{see also|Maya textiles}}
Textiles from the Classic period, made of cotton, have not survived, but Maya art provides detailed information about their appearance and, to a lesser extent, their social function.&lt;ref&gt;Looper 2000&lt;/ref&gt; They include delicate fabrics used as wrappings, curtains and canopies furnishing palaces, and garments. Among the dyeing techniques may have been [[ikat]]. Daily costume depended on social standing. Noblewomen usually wore long dresses, noblemen girdles and breechcloths, leaving legs and upper body more or less bare, unless jackets or mantles were worn. Both men and women could wear turbans. Costumes worn on ceremonial occasions and during the many festivities were highly expressive and exuberant; animal headdresses were common. The most elaborate costume was the formal apparel of the king, as depicted on the royal stelae, with numerous elements of symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Dillon and Christensen 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Wickerwork, only known from incidental depictions in sculptural and ceramic art,&lt;ref&gt;Reents-Budet 1994: 331&lt;/ref&gt; must once have been ubiquitous; the well-known ''pop'' ('mat') motif testifies to its importance.&lt;ref&gt;Robicsek 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

Body decorations often consisted of painted patterns on face and body, but could also be of a permanent character marking status and age differences. The latter type included artificial deformation of the skull, filing and incrustation of the teeth, and tattooing of the face.&lt;ref&gt;Houston et al. 2006: 18-25&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum collections==
[[File:Nationalmuseum für Archäologie und Ethnologie, Guatemala-20.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología]], in [[Guatemala City]]]]
There are a great many museums across the world with Maya artifacts in their collections. The [[Foundation for the Advancement of Mesoamerican Studies]] lists over 250 museums in its Maya Museum database,&lt;ref&gt;Ros.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Association of Mayanists]] lists just under 50 museums in Europe alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wayeb.org/resources-links/museums-collections/|title=Museums &amp; Collections - Wayeb|author=|date=|website=wayeb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mexico City]], the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Mexico)|Museo Nacional de Antropología]] contains an especially large selection of Maya artifacts.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p451"&gt;Wagner 2011, p. 451.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of regional museums in Mexico hold important collections, including the [[Museo de las Estelas "Román Piña Chan"]] in [[Campeche, Campeche|Campeche]],&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p450"/&gt; the [[Museo Regional de Yucatán "Palacio Cantón"]] in [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]], and the [[Museo Regional de Antropología "Carlos Pellicer Camera"]] in [[Villahermosa]], Tabasco.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p452"&gt;Wagner 2011, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important museum collections in Guatemala are those of the [[Museo Popol Vuh]] and the [[Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología]], both in [[Guatemala City]].&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p451"/&gt; Notable museums with collections of Maya artifacts include the [[British Museum]] in [[London]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]], the [[Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]], and the [[University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology]]. The [[Museum of Cultures (Basel)|Museum der Kulturen]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], holds a number of wooden lintels from Tikal; the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin|Ethnologisches Museum]] in [[Berlin]] holds a broad selection of Maya artifacts. In [[Belgium]], the [[Royal Museums of Art and History|Musées royaux d'art et d'histoire]] in [[Brussels]] houses an important collection.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p450"&gt;Wagner 2011, p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Field Museum of Natural History]] in [[Chicago]] contains a notable selection of Maya ceramics,&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p450"/&gt; while the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] in [[Ohio]] has one of the most extensive Maya collections in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p451"/&gt; The [[Museum of the Americas (Madrid)|Museo de América]] in [[Madrid]] hosts a large selection of artifacts from Palenque; it is also home to the Madrid Codex.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p452"/&gt; Other notable European museums are the [[National Museum of Ethnology (Netherlands)|Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde]] in [[Leiden]], [[Netherlands]], home to the Leyden Plate, and the [[Rietberg Museum]] in [[Zürich]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Wagner2011p452"/&gt;

'''ArtBakery''' is an art centre based in the village of [[Bonendale]] a few kilometers from [[Douala]] and founded by [[Goddy Leye]]. The centre offers trainings for emerging artists (Master Class), journalists (Art Daily) and residency programs for young artists (Portfolio). ArtBakery is specifically designed to technically support the production of multimedia artworks, video and digital art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.powerofculture.nl/uk/specials/rain/artbakery.html ArtBakery] on "The Power of Culture"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
ArtBakery is founded in 2002 after the artist [[Goddy Leye]] moves back to [[Cameroon]] from the [[Netherlands]]. The centre is part of the [[Rijksakademie]] International Network (RAIN), a network of artists who support contemporary cultural practices in their countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.r-a-i-n.net|title=R-A-I-N|website=www.r-a-i-n.net|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; RAIN supports ArtBakery and its first project ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Bessengue_City_Douala Bessengue City]''.

== Activities ==
=== Bessengue City ===
''Bessengue City'' is a project designed and coordinated by [[Goddy Leye]] and organised in [[Bessengue]] [[Douala]] in October 2002. The project involved the artists [[James Beckett (artist)|James Beckett]], [[Goddy Leye]], [[Hartanto]], [[Jesus Palomino]] and the local community and it was produced with the support of [[Rijksakademie|Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten]] of [[Amsterdam]] and by the programme R.A.I.N. Rain Artists’ Initiative Network. 
James Beckett produces in the neighbourhood of [[Bessengue]] an experimental radio, with a range of one kilometre and the collaboration of a group of young people which made interviews and recordings. The radio was called ''Radio Bessengue City'', or ''Dikalo la Bessengue'' (the messenger of Bessengue) becomes, as one listener said, “the radio of the people by the people”.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Goddy Leye takes pictures of twenty smiling people from the neighbourhood and makes some digital manipulation. The portraits are printed and arranged in random groups and positioned as posters in the estate. Produced from the same footage, the 6-minute video called ''Bouquet de Sourires'' (Bouquet of Smiles), is shown in the neighbourhood.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Hartanto builds the website of the project and he connects one person from Bessengue with another from [[Bandung]]. The messages, written in French (Bessengue) and Indonesian (Bandung), are scanned and sent with their translation in both directions. News on everyday life and the local environment are exchanged on a daily basis.

=== Exit Tour ===
''Exit Tour - [[Douala]], [[Cotonou]], [[Lomé]], [[Accra]], [[Ouagadougou]], [[Bamako]], [[Dakar]]'' is a collaborative artistic project organised in 2006. In occasion of [[Dak'art 2006]], seven artists ([[Ginette Daleu]], [[Justine Gaga]], [[Dunja Herzog]], [[Lucfosther Diop]], [[Achillekà|Achillekà Komguem]], [[Alioum Moussa]] and [[Goddy Leye]]) departed from Douala and reached Dakar using only public transportation. During the three-months journey, the artists visited galleries, artists and participated to workshops in [[Cotonou]], [[Lomé]], [[Accra]], [[Ouagadougou]], [[Bamako]], [[Dakar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://africanartists.blogspot.com/2011/02/dairy-to-dakart-2006.html|title=Unseen Art Scene: Journey from Douala to Dak'Art 2006|last=Scene|first=Unseen Art|date=2011-02-24|website=Unseen Art Scene|access-date=2017-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through a programme of advocacy, exhibitions and publication, Autograph went on to assist in the career development of a number of black and "culturally diverse" photographers, including [[Faisal Abdu'Allah]], [[Gayle Chong Kwan]], Roshini Kempadoo and [[Yinka Shonibare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carlagirl.net/writing/rbp.html |title=Recent Black Photographers.

In 1991 [[Mark Sealy]] became the director of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africultures.com/php/?nav=personne&amp;no=14457 Mark Sealy biography], Africultures.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the board changed the name to "Autograph ABP".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intute.ac.uk/artsandhumanities/cgi-bin/fullrecord.pl?handle=artifact141 |title=Full record - Autograph ABP |publisher=Intute |date= |accessdate=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the organisation moved into its new home [[Rivington Place]], which it shares with [[Iniva]]. Renowned Cultural Studies theorist [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] served as chair on the boards of both organisations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iniva.org/library/archive/people/h/hall_stuart "Stuart Hall"], Iniva.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the honorary patrons of Autograph ABP are [[David Lammy]] MP, Professor [[Catherine Hall]], [[Lola Young]] (Baroness Young of Hornsey) OBE, and [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://autograph-abp.co.uk/who-we-are/ "Who We Are"], Autograph ABP.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Autograph ABP received a grant of £660,500 from the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] (HLF) to "preserve the history of culturally diverse Britain through photography".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ephotozine.com/article/autograph-abp-receive-grant-from-heritage-lottery-fund-8761 |title=Autograph ABP receive grant from Heritage Lottery Fund

==Role==
Today, Autograph continues to develop, exhibit and publish the work of photographers and artists from culturally diverse backgrounds and to act as an advocate for their inclusion in mainstream areas of exhibition, publishing, training, education and commerce. Autograph produces its own programme of activities, as well as collaborating with other arts organisations nationally and internationally, such as the [[Liverpool Biennial]]. It also sees itself as playing a role in the advocacy of human rights worldwide, hosting exhibitions on the subjects of Roma/Gypsy peoples in Europe, as well as the photographic legacy of lynching in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rivingtonplace.org/WithoutSanctuary "Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America"].

'''Color''' ([[American English]]), or '''colour''' ([[English in the Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth English]]), is the characteristic of [[humans|human]] [[Color vision|visual perception]] described through color ''categories'', with names such as [[red]], [[orange (colour)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], or [[purple]]. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of [[cone cell]]s in the human eye by [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the [[visible spectrum]]. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc.

By defining a [[color space]], colors can be identified numerically by coordinates, which in 1931 were also named in global agreement with internationally agreed color names like mentioned above (red, orange, etc.) by the [[International Commission on Illumination]]. The [[RGB color space]] for instance is a color space corresponding to human [[trichromacy]] and to the three cone cell types that respond to three bands of light: long wavelengths, peaking near 564–580 [[nanometre|nm]] (''red''); medium-wavelength, peaking near 534–545&amp;nbsp;nm (''green''); and short-wavelength light, near 420–440&amp;nbsp;nm (''blue'').&lt;ref name="Wyszecki"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;    There may also be more than three color dimensions in other color spaces, such as in the [[CMYK color model]], wherein one of the dimensions relates to a color's [[colorfulness]]).

The photo-receptivity of the "eyes" of other species also varies considerably from that of humans and so results in correspondingly [[Color vision#In other animal species|different ''color'' perceptions]] that cannot readily be compared to one another.  [[Honey bee|Honeybees]] and [[bumblebees]] for instance have trichromatic color vision sensitive to [[ultraviolet]] but is insensitive to red.

The science of color is sometimes called '''chromatics''', '''[[colorimetry]]''', or simply '''color science'''. It includes the study of the perception of color by the [[human eye]] and brain, the origin of color in materials, [[color theory]] in [[art]], and the [[physics]] of [[electromagnetic radiation]] in the visible range (that is, what is commonly referred to simply as ''[[light]]'').

[[Electromagnetic radiation]] is characterized by its [[wavelength]] (or [[frequency]]) and its [[Luminous intensity|intensity]]. When the wavelength is within the visible spectrum (the range of wavelengths humans can perceive, approximately from 390&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] to 700&amp;nbsp;nm), it is known as "visible light".

Most light sources emit light at many different wavelengths; a source's ''spectrum'' is a distribution giving its intensity at each wavelength. Although the spectrum of light arriving at the eye from a given direction determines the color [[Wikt:sensation|sensation]] in that direction, there are many more possible spectral combinations than color sensations. In fact, one may formally define a color as a class of spectra that give rise to the same color sensation, although such classes would vary widely among different species, and to a lesser extent among individuals within the same species. In each such class the members are called ''[[Metamerism (color)|metamers]]'' of the color in question.

=== Spectral colors ===

The familiar colors of the [[rainbow]] in the [[Optical spectrum|spectrum]]—named using the [[Latin]] word for ''appearance'' or ''apparition'' by [[Isaac Newton]] in 1671—include all those colors that can be produced by [[visible light]] of a single wavelength only, the [[spectral color|''pure spectral'' or ''monochromatic'' colors]]. The table at right shows approximate frequencies (in [[hertz|terahertz]]) and wavelengths (in [[nanometre|nanometers]]) for various pure spectral colors. The wavelengths listed are as measured in air or [[vacuum]] (see [[refractive index]]).

The color table should not be interpreted as a definitive list—the pure spectral colors form a continuous spectrum, and how it is divided into distinct colors [[language|linguistically]] is a matter of culture and historical contingency (although people everywhere have been shown to ''perceive'' colors in the same way&lt;ref&gt;[[Brent Berlin|Berlin, B.]] and [[Paul Kay|Kay, P.]], ''[[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution]]'', Berkeley: [[University of California Press]], 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;). A common list identifies six main bands: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. Newton's conception included a seventh color, [[indigo]], between blue and violet. It is possible that what Newton referred to as blue is nearer to what today is known as [[cyan]], and that indigo was simply the dark blue of the [[indigo dye]] that was being imported at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waldman|first=Gary|title=Introduction to light : the physics of light, vision, and color|year=2002|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-42118-6|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbsoAXWbnr4C&amp;pg=PA193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''intensity'' of a spectral color, relative to the context in which it is viewed, may alter its perception considerably; for example, a low-intensity orange-yellow is [[brown]], and a low-intensity yellow-green is [[olive green]].

=== Color of objects ===

The color of an object depends on both the physics of the object in its environment and the characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain. Physically, objects can be said to have the color of the light leaving their surfaces, which normally depends on the spectrum of the incident illumination and the reflectance properties of the surface, as well as potentially on the angles of illumination and viewing. Some objects not only reflect light, but also transmit light or emit light themselves, which also contributes to the color. A viewer's perception of the object's color depends not only on the spectrum of the light leaving its surface, but also on a host of contextual cues, so that color differences between objects can be discerned mostly independent of the lighting spectrum, viewing angle, etc. This effect is known as [[color constancy]].

[[File:Optical grey squares orange brown.svg|right|thumb|250px|The upper disk and the lower disk have exactly the same objective color, and are in identical gray surroundings; based on context differences, humans perceive the squares as having different reflectances, and may interpret the colors as different color categories; see [[checker shadow illusion]].]]

Some generalizations of the physics can be drawn, neglecting perceptual effects for now:
* Light arriving at an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] surface is either [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] "[[Specular reflection|specularly]]" (that is, in the manner of a mirror), [[scattering|scattered]] (that is, reflected with diffuse scattering), or [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] – or some combination of these.
* Opaque objects that do not reflect specularly (which tend to have rough surfaces) have their color determined by which wavelengths of light they scatter strongly (with the light that is not scattered being absorbed). If objects scatter all wavelengths with roughly equal strength, they appear white. If they absorb all wavelengths, they appear black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pastoureau|first=Michael|title=Black: The History of a Color|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=216|isbn=978-0691139302}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Opaque objects that specularly reflect light of different wavelengths with different efficiencies look like mirrors tinted with colors determined by those differences. An object that reflects some fraction of impinging light and absorbs the rest may look black but also be faintly reflective; examples are black objects coated with layers of enamel or lacquer.
* Objects that [[Transparency and translucency|transmit light]] are either ''translucent'' (scattering the transmitted light) or ''transparent'' (not scattering the transmitted light). If they also absorb (or reflect) light of various wavelengths differentially, they appear tinted with a color determined by the nature of that absorption (or that reflectance).
* Objects may emit light that they generate from having excited electrons, rather than merely reflecting or transmitting light. The electrons may be excited due to elevated temperature (''[[incandescence]]''), as a result of chemical reactions (''[[chemoluminescence]]''), after absorbing light of other frequencies ("[[fluorescence]]" or "[[phosphorescence]]") or from electrical contacts as in [[light emitting diodes]], or other [[list of light sources|light sources]].

To summarize, the color of an object is a complex result of its surface properties, its transmission properties, and its emission properties, all of which contribute to the mix of wavelengths in the light leaving the surface of the object. The perceived color is then further conditioned by the nature of the ambient illumination, and by the color properties of other objects nearby, and via other characteristics of the perceiving eye and brain.

=== Development of theories of color vision ===
{{Main|Color theory}}

Although [[Aristotle]] and other ancient scientists had already written on the nature of light and [[color vision]], it was not until [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] that light was identified as the source of the color sensation. In 1810, [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] published his comprehensive ''[[Theory of Colours|Theory of Colors]]'' in which he ascribed physiological effects to color that are now understood as psychological.

In 1801 [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] proposed his [[Trichromacy|trichromatic theory]], based on the observation that any color could be matched with a combination of three lights. This theory was later refined by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]. As Helmholtz puts it, "the principles of Newton's law of mixture were experimentally confirmed by Maxwell in 1856. Young's theory of color sensations, like so much else that this marvelous investigator achieved in advance of his time, remained unnoticed until Maxwell directed attention to it."&lt;ref&gt;Hermann von Helmholtz, ''Physiological Optics – The Sensations of Vision'', 1866, as translated in ''Sources of Color Science'', David L. MacAdam, ed., Cambridge: [[MIT Press]], 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time as Helmholtz, [[Ewald Hering]] developed the [[opponent process]] theory of color, noting that [[color blindness]] and afterimages typically come in opponent pairs (red-green, blue-orange, yellow-violet, and black-white). Ultimately these two theories were synthesized in 1957 by Hurvich and Jameson, who showed that retinal processing corresponds to the trichromatic theory, while processing at the level of the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] corresponds to the opponent theory.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S.E. (1999). ''Vision Science: Photons to Phenomenology'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. {{ISBN|0-262-16183-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, an international group of experts known as the ''Commission internationale de l'éclairage'' ([[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]]) developed a mathematical color model, which mapped out the space of observable colors and assigned a set of three numbers to each.

=== Color in the eye ===
{{Main|Color vision}}

[[File:Cones SMJ2 E.svg|thumb|300px|right|Normalized typical human [[cone cell]] responses (S, M, and L types) to monochromatic spectral stimuli]]

The ability of the [[human eye]] to distinguish colors is based upon the varying sensitivity of different cells in the [[retina]] to light of different [[wavelengths]]. Humans are [[Trichromacy|trichromatic]]—the retina contains three types of color receptor cells, or [[cone cell|cones]]. One type, relatively distinct from the other two, is most responsive to light that is perceived as blue or blue-violet, with wavelengths around 450 [[nanometre|nm]]; cones of this type are sometimes called ''short-wavelength cones'', ''S cones'', or ''blue cones''. The other two types are closely related genetically and chemically: ''middle-wavelength cones'', ''M cones'', or ''green cones'' are most sensitive to light perceived as green, with wavelengths around 540&amp;nbsp;nm, while the ''long-wavelength cones'', ''L cones'', or ''red cones'', are most sensitive to light is perceived as greenish yellow, with wavelengths around 570 &amp;nbsp;nm.

Light, no matter how complex its composition of wavelengths, is reduced to three color components by the eye. Each cone type adheres to the [[principle of univariance]], which is that each cone's output is determined by the amount of light that falls on it over all wavelengths. For each location in the visual field, the three types of cones yield three signals based on the extent to which each is stimulated. These amounts of stimulation are sometimes called ''tristimulus values''.

The response curve as a function of wavelength varies for each type of cone. Because the curves overlap, some tristimulus values do not occur for any incoming light combination. For example, it is not possible to stimulate ''only'' the mid-wavelength (so-called "green") cones; the other cones will inevitably be stimulated to some degree at the same time. The set of all possible tristimulus values determines the human ''color space''. It has been estimated that humans can distinguish roughly 10 million different colors.&lt;ref name="business" /&gt;

The other type of light-sensitive cell in the eye, the [[rod cell|rod]], has a different response curve. In normal situations, when light is bright enough to strongly stimulate the cones, rods play virtually no role in vision at all.&lt;ref&gt;"Under well-lit viewing conditions (photopic vision), cones&amp;nbsp; ...are highly active and rods are inactive." {{cite conference|last=Hirakawa |first=K. |author2=Parks, T.W. |title=Chromatic Adaptation and White-Balance Problem |conference=IEEE ICIP |year=2005 |doi=10.1109/ICIP.2005.1530559 |url=http://www.accidentalmark.com/research/papers/Hirakawa05WBICIP.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128184104/http://www.accidentalmark.com/research/papers/Hirakawa05WBICIP.pdf |archivedate=November 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in dim light, the cones are understimulated leaving only the signal from the rods, resulting in a [[Black-and-white|colorless]] response. (Furthermore, the rods are barely sensitive to light in the "red" range.) In certain conditions of intermediate illumination, the rod response and a weak cone response can together result in color discriminations not accounted for by cone responses alone. These effects, combined, are summarized also in the [[Kruithof curve]], that describes the change of color perception and pleasingness of light as function of temperature and intensity.

=== Color in the brain ===
{{Main|Color vision}}

[[File:Ventral-dorsal streams.svg|thumb|right|300px|The visual [[dorsal stream]] (green) and [[ventral stream]] (purple) are shown. The ventral stream is responsible for color perception.]]

While the mechanisms of color vision at the level of the retina are well-described in terms of tristimulus values, color processing after that point is organized differently. A dominant theory of color vision proposes that color information is transmitted out of the eye by three [[opponent processes]], or opponent channels, each constructed from the raw output of the cones: a red–green channel, a blue–yellow channel, and a black–white "luminance" channel. This theory has been supported by neurobiology, and accounts for the structure of our subjective color experience. Specifically, it explains why humans cannot perceive a "reddish green" or "yellowish blue", and it predicts the [[color wheel]]: it is the collection of colors for which at least one of the two color channels measures a value at one of its extremes.

The exact nature of color perception beyond the processing already described, and indeed the status of color as a feature of the perceived world or rather as a feature of our ''perception'' of the world – a type of [[qualia]] – is a matter of complex and continuing philosophical dispute.

=== Nonstandard color perception ===

==== Color deficiency ====
{{Main|Color blindness}}

If one or more types of a person's color-sensing cones are missing or less responsive than normal to incoming light, that person can distinguish fewer colors and is said to be ''color deficient'' or ''[[color blindness|color blind]]'' (though this latter term can be misleading; almost all color deficient individuals can distinguish at least some colors). Some kinds of color deficiency are caused by anomalies in the number or nature of cones in the retina. Others (like ''central'' or ''cortical'' ''[[achromatopsia]]'') are caused by neural anomalies in those parts of the brain where visual processing takes place.

==== Tetrachromacy ====
{{Main|Tetrachromacy}}

While most humans are ''trichromatic'' (having three types of color receptors), many animals, known as ''[[Tetrachromacy|tetrachromats]]'', have four types. These include some species of [[spider]]s, most [[marsupial]]s, [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, and many species of [[fish]]. Other species are sensitive to only two axes of color or do not perceive color at all; these are called ''dichromats'' and ''monochromats'' respectively. A distinction is made between ''retinal tetrachromacy'' (having four pigments in cone cells in the retina, compared to three in trichromats) and ''functional tetrachromacy'' (having the ability to make enhanced color discriminations based on that retinal difference). As many as half of all women are retinal tetrachromats.&lt;ref name="Jameson"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jameson |first= K. A. |last2= Highnote |first2= S. M. |last3= Wasserman |first3= L. M.|year = 2001|title = Richer color experience in observers with multiple photopigment opsin genes.|doi = 10.3758/BF03196159|journal = Psychonomic Bulletin and Review|volume = 8|issue = 2|pages = 244–61|url = https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03196159.pdf|format = PDF|pmid = 11495112}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.256}} The phenomenon arises when an individual receives two slightly different copies of the gene for either the medium- or long-wavelength cones, which are carried on the [[X&amp;nbsp;chromosome]]. To have two different genes, a person must have two X&amp;nbsp;chromosomes, which is why the phenomenon only occurs in women.&lt;ref name="Jameson" /&gt; There is one scholarly report that confirms the existence of a functional tetrachromat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=G.|last2=Deeb|first2=S. S.|last3=Bosten|first3=J. M.|last4=Mollon|first4=J.

==== Synesthesia ====

In certain forms of [[synesthesia]]/[[ideasthesia]], perceiving letters and numbers ([[grapheme-color synesthesia|grapheme–color synesthesia]]) or hearing musical sounds (music–color synesthesia) will lead to the unusual additional experiences of seeing colors. Behavioral and [[functional neuroimaging]] experiments have demonstrated that these color experiences lead to changes in behavioral tasks and lead to increased activation of brain regions involved in color perception, thus demonstrating their reality, and similarity to real color percepts, albeit evoked through a non-standard route.

=== Afterimages ===

After exposure to strong light in their sensitivity range, [[Photoreceptor cell|photoreceptors]] of a given type become desensitized. For a few seconds after the light ceases, they will continue to signal less strongly than they otherwise would. Colors observed during that period will appear to lack the color component detected by the desensitized photoreceptors. This effect is responsible for the phenomenon of [[afterimage]]s, in which the eye may continue to see a bright figure after looking away from it, but in a [[complementary color]].

Afterimage effects have also been utilized by artists, including [[Vincent van Gogh]].

=== Color constancy ===
{{Main|Color constancy}}

When an artist uses a limited [[color scheme|color palette]], the [[Human eye|eye]] tends to compensate by seeing any gray or neutral color as the color which is missing from the color wheel. For example, in a limited palette consisting of red, yellow, black, and white, a mixture of yellow and black will appear as a variety of green, a mixture of red and black will appear as a variety of purple, and pure gray will appear bluish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Depauw|first=Robert C.|title=United States Patent|url=http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT3815265&amp;id=tSEzAAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;dq=mixing+paint+colors&amp;printsec=abstract#v=onepage&amp;q=mixing%20paint%20colors&amp;f=false|accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- not due to black pigment being dark blue therefore reflecting more blue light? This is a real physical phenomenon and not a perceptual one. Is this paragraph not irrelevant to color constancy? --&gt;

The trichromatic theory is strictly true when the visual system is in a fixed state of adaptation. In reality, the visual system is constantly adapting to changes in the environment and compares the various colors in a scene to reduce the effects of the illumination. If a scene is illuminated with one light, and then with another, as long as the difference between the light sources stays within a reasonable range, the colors in the scene appear relatively constant to us. This was studied by [[Edwin Land]] in the 1970s and led to his retinex theory of [[color constancy]].

Both phenomena are readily explained and mathematically modeled with modern theories of chromatic adaptation and color appearance (e.g. [[CIECAM02]], iCAM).&lt;ref name="CAM"&gt;M.D. Fairchild, [http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470012161.html Color Appearance Models] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505034940/http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470012161.html |date=May 5, 2011 }}, 2nd Ed., Wiley, Chichester (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; There is no need to dismiss the trichromatic theory of vision, but rather it can be enhanced with an understanding of how the visual system adapts to changes in the viewing environment.

=== Color naming ===
{{Main|Color term}}
{{See also|Lists of colors|Web colors}}
[[File:1Mcolors.png|thumb|This picture contains one million pixels, each one a different color]]
Colors vary in several different ways, including [[hue]] (shades of [[red]], [[Orange (colour)|orange]], [[yellow]], [[green]], [[blue]], and [[Violet (color)|violet]]), [[saturation (color theory)|saturation]], [[brightness]], and [[Gloss (material appearance)|gloss]]. Some color words are derived from the name of an object of that color, such as "[[Orange (fruit)|orange]]" or "[[Salmon (color)|salmon]]", while others are abstract, like "red".

In the 1969 study ''[[Basic Color Terms: Their Universality and Evolution]]'', [[Brent Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay]] describe a pattern in naming "basic" colors (like "red" but not "red-orange" or "dark red" or "blood red", which are "shades" of red). All languages that have two "basic" color names distinguish dark/cool colors from bright/warm colors. The next colors to be distinguished are usually red and then yellow or green. All languages with six "basic" colors include black, white, red, green, blue, and yellow. The pattern holds up to a set of twelve: black, gray, white, pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, and [[azure (color)|azure]] (distinct from blue in [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]], but not English).

=== Associations ===

Individual colors have a variety of cultural associations such as [[national colors]] (in general described in individual color articles and [[color symbolism]]). The field of [[color psychology]] attempts to identify the effects of color on human emotion and activity. [[Chromotherapy]] is a form of [[alternative medicine]] attributed to various Eastern traditions. Colors have different associations in different countries and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalization-group.com/edge/resources/color-meanings-by-culture/|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20101012003744/http://www.globalization-group.com/edge/resources/color-meanings-by-culture/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-10-12|title= Chart: Color Meanings by Culture|accessdate=2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different colors have been demonstrated to have effects on cognition. For example, researchers at the University of Linz in Austria demonstrated that the color red significantly decreases cognitive functioning in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gnambs | first1 = Timo | last2 = Appel | first2 = Markus | last3 = Batinic | first3 = Bernad | year = 2010 | title = Color red in web-based knowledge testing | url = | journal = Computers in Human Behavior | volume = 26 | issue = 6| pages = 1625–1631 | doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spectral colors and color reproduction ==

[[File:CIExy1931 fixed.svg|right|thumb|upright|The [[CIE 1931 color space]] [[chromaticity diagram]]. The outer curved boundary is the spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers. The colors depicted depend on the [[color space]] of the device on which you are viewing the image, and therefore may not be a strictly accurate representation of the color at a particular position, and especially not for monochromatic colors.]]

Most light sources are mixtures of various wavelengths of light. Many such sources can still effectively produce a spectral color, as the eye cannot distinguish them from single-wavelength sources. For example, most computer displays reproduce the spectral color orange as a combination of red and green light; it appears orange because the red and green are mixed in the right proportions to allow the eye's cones to respond the way they do to the spectral color orange.

A useful concept in understanding the perceived color of a non-monochromatic light source is the [[dominant wavelength]], which identifies the single wavelength of light that produces a sensation most similar to the light source. Dominant wavelength is roughly akin to [[hue]].

There are many color perceptions that by definition cannot be pure spectral colors due to [[Saturation (color theory)|desaturation]] or because they are [[purple]]s (mixtures of red and violet light, from opposite ends of the spectrum). Some examples of necessarily non-spectral colors are the achromatic colors (black, gray, and white) and colors such as [[pink]], [[Tan (color)|tan]], and [[magenta]].

Two different light spectra that have the same effect on the three color receptors in the [[human eye]] will be perceived as the same color. They are [[Metamerism (color)|metamers]] of that color. This is exemplified by the white light emitted by fluorescent lamps, which typically has a spectrum of a few narrow bands, while daylight has a continuous spectrum. The human eye cannot tell the difference between such light spectra just by looking into the light source, although reflected colors from objects can look different. (This is often exploited; for example, to make [[fruit]] or [[tomato]]es look more intensely red.)

Similarly, most human color perceptions can be generated by a mixture of three colors called ''primaries''. This is used to reproduce color scenes in photography, printing, television, and other media. There are a number of methods or [[color space]]s for specifying a color in terms of three particular primary colors. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages depending on the particular application.

No mixture of colors, however, can produce a response truly identical to that of a spectral color, although one can get close, especially for the longer wavelengths, where the [[CIE 1931 color space]] chromaticity diagram has a nearly straight edge. For example, mixing green light (530&amp;nbsp;nm) and blue light (460&amp;nbsp;nm) produces cyan light that is slightly desaturated, because response of the red color receptor would be greater to the green and blue light in the mixture than it would be to a pure cyan light at 485&amp;nbsp;nm that has the same intensity as the mixture of blue and green.

Because of this, and because the ''primaries'' in [[color printing]] systems generally are not pure themselves, the colors reproduced are never perfectly saturated spectral colors, and so spectral colors cannot be matched exactly. However, natural scenes rarely contain fully saturated colors, thus such scenes can usually be approximated well by these systems. The range of colors that can be reproduced with a given color reproduction system is called the [[gamut]]. The [[International Commission on Illumination|CIE]] chromaticity diagram can be used to describe the gamut.

Another problem with color reproduction systems is connected with the acquisition devices, like cameras or scanners. The characteristics of the color sensors in the devices are often very far from the characteristics of the receptors in the human eye. In effect, acquisition of colors can be relatively poor if they have special, often very "jagged", spectra caused for example by unusual lighting of the photographed scene.
A color reproduction system "tuned" to a human with normal color vision may give very inaccurate results for other observers.

The different color response of different devices can be problematic if not properly managed. For color information stored and transferred in digital form, [[color management]] techniques, such as those based on [[ICC profile]]s, can help to avoid distortions of the reproduced colors. Color management does not circumvent the gamut limitations of particular output devices, but can assist in finding good mapping of input colors into the gamut that can be reproduced.

=== Additive coloring ===

[[File:AdditiveColor.svg|thumb|Additive color mixing: combining red and green yields yellow; combining all three primary colors together yields white.]]

[[Additive color]] is light created by mixing together [[light]] of two or more different colors. [[Red]], [[green]], and [[blue]] are the additive [[primary color]]s normally used in additive color systems such as projectors and computer terminals.

=== Subtractive coloring ===

[[File:SubtractiveColor.svg|thumb|Subtractive color mixing: combining yellow and magenta yields red; combining all three primary colors together yields black]]

[[Subtractive color]]ing uses dyes, inks, pigments, or filters to absorb some wavelengths of light and not others. The color that a surface displays comes from the parts of the visible spectrum that are not absorbed and therefore remain visible. Without pigments or dye, fabric fibers, paint base and paper are usually made of particles that scatter white light (all colors) well in all directions. When a pigment or ink is added, wavelengths are absorbed or "subtracted" from white light, so light of another color reaches the eye.

If the light is not a pure white source (the case of nearly all forms of artificial lighting), the resulting spectrum will appear a slightly different color. [[Red]] paint, viewed under [[blue]] light, may appear [[black]]. Red paint is red because it scatters only the red components of the spectrum. If red paint is illuminated by blue light, it will be absorbed by the red paint, creating the appearance of a black object.

=== Structural color ===
{{further|Structural coloration|Animal coloration}}

Structural colors are colors caused by interference effects rather than by pigments. Color effects are produced when a material is scored with fine parallel lines, formed of one or more parallel thin layers, or otherwise composed of microstructures on the scale of the color's [[wavelength]]. If the microstructures are spaced randomly, light of shorter wavelengths will be scattered preferentially to produce [[Tyndall effect]] colors: the blue of the sky (Rayleigh scattering, caused by structures much smaller than the wavelength of light, in this case air molecules), the luster of [[opal]]s, and the blue of human irises. If the microstructures are aligned in arrays, for example the array of pits in a CD, they behave as a [[diffraction grating]]: the grating reflects different wavelengths in different directions due to [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] phenomena, separating mixed "white" light into light of different wavelengths. If the structure is one or more thin layers then it will reflect some wavelengths and transmit others, depending on the layers' thickness.

Structural color is studied in the field of [[thin-film optics]]. The most ordered or the most changeable structural colors are [[iridescence|iridescent]]. Structural color is responsible for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the blue jay, for example), as well as certain butterfly wings and beetle shells. Variations in the pattern's spacing often give rise to an iridescent effect, as seen in [[peacock]] feathers, [[soap bubbles]], films of oil, and [[mother of pearl]], because the reflected color depends upon the viewing angle. Numerous scientists have carried out research in butterfly wings and beetle shells, including Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke. Since 1942, [[Electron microscope|electron micrography]] has been used, advancing the development of products that exploit structural color, such as "[[photonic]]" cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrc.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/events/FSS/2006/science.aspx?ComponentId=14867&amp;SourcePageId=14865 |title=Economic and Social Research Council – Science in the Dock, Art in the Stocks |accessdate=2007-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102025015/http://www.esrc.ac.uk/ESRCInfoCentre/about/CI/events/FSS/2006/science.aspx?ComponentId=14867&amp;SourcePageId=14865 |archivedate=November 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Death of the Poet"''' ({{lang-ru|Смерть Поэта}}) is an 1837 poem by [[Mikhail Lermontov]], written in reaction to the death of [[Alexander Pushkin]].

Pushkin was mortally wounded in a duel on January 27, 1837, and died on the 29th. Lermontov began his first formulation of the poem (ending with the phrase "...his lips forever sealed") as soon as he heard of the event, and within a short time copies of the poem began to be circulated in [[St. Petersburg]].

Within days the doctor [[Nikolai Arendt]] visited Lermontov (who was ill) and told him the details of the death of Pushkin, whom Arendt had tried to save.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chmielewska |first1=E. M. |title=Лермонтовская энциклопедия |trans-title=Lermontov Encyclopedia |publisher=Soviet Encyclopedia |trans-chapter=Arendt, Nikolai Fedorovich |chapter=А́РЕНДТ Николай Федорович |chapterurl=http://feb-web.ru/feb/lermenc/lre-abc/lre/lre-0363.htm}} {{language icon|ru}} Mikhail Iurevich Lermontov (1814-1841)&lt;/ref&gt; Arendt's story likely influenced Lermontov's development of the poem.

[[Pyotr Vyazemsky]] described the reaction of Arendt to the death of Pushkin:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Пушкин А. С. Сочинения |trans-title=Works of A. S. Pushkin |year=1999 |publisher=ИД Синергия |location=Moscow}} Mikhail Iurevich Lermontov (1814-1841)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mikhail lermontov.jpg|thumb|upright|Mikhail Lermontov. 1837 portrait by Pyotr Zabolotsky.]]
On February 7, Lermontov added an acerbic final sixteen lines (beginning "And you, the arrogant descendants of infamous scoundrels...") to the poem. These lines called for divine justice upon the heads of the "greedy horde" of the court aristocracy, whom Lermontov condemned as executioners of freedom and the true culprits of the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homeenglish.ru/ArticlesLermontov.htm |title=Mikhail Yuryevich Lermontov Biography |author= |year=2005 |work=Home English |accessdate=March 4, 2011}} {{language icon|en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hand-written copies of this version of the poem circulated among the Petersburg intelligentsia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/HIS241/Notes/Lermontov.html |title=Mikhail Iurevich Lermontov (1814-1841) |author=C. T. Evans |year=2010 |work=Nova Online |accessdate=March 4, 2011}} {{language icon|en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and came to the attention of the authorities. Those final sixteen lines were regarded by the authorities as seditious [[freethought|free thinking]], and Lermontov was arrested. After a brief investigation he was, on the orders of the Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]], exiled to a regiment in the [[Caucasus Region|Caucasus]] on February 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rulex.ru/01120263.htm |title=Лермонтов Михаил Юрьевич |trans-title=Mikhail Lermontov |author= |date= |work=Russian Biographical Dictionary a|accessdate=March 4, 2011}} {{language icon|ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was only published long after Lermontov's death. The first publication (a German translation under the title "Lermontov's lament at the grave of Alexander Pushkin") was in 1852 in [[Friedrich von Bodenstedt]]'s ''Mikhail Lermontoff's Poetic Legacy''. The first published English translation (under the title "On the death of Pushkin") was in 1856, in [[Alexander Herzen]]'s London periodical ''Polar Star''.

[[Image:Dimanche.jpg|thumb|250px|''Dimanche'', 1960]]
'''''Dimanche''''' (''Sunday''), also known as '''''Dimanche - Le Journal d'un Seul Jour''''' (''Sunday - The Newspaper for Only One Day'') is an [[artist's book]] by the French artist [[Yves Klein]]. Taking the form of a 4-page Sunday [[broadsheet]], the piece was published on Sunday 27 November 1960 and sold on newsstands throughout [[Paris]] for one day only, as well as being handed out at a press conference held by Klein at the Galerie Rive Droite at 11.00am on the same day.

An early example of [[conceptual art]], it is most famous for being the first time that the photo-montage commonly known as ''The Leap Into The Void'' was published.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Dimanche combines appropriation, performance, actionism, conceptual art, and photo-montage all in one, and hints at this range of art movements just then coming into existence. It takes the form of a one-day newspaper, designed as an alternative to the regular Sunday paper, and includes texts and visual works by Klein, including his manifesto, "Theatre du Vide" (Theater of the Void). The photograph, captioned "Un homme dans l'espace" (A man in open space) depicts the artist leaping from his dealer's second-story window into the void. It inspired numerous artists to explore their bodies as a medium for art.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/84870/dimanche Artsconnected.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The festival of avant-garde art==
[[Image:Klein-newsstand.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A parisian news stand selling ''Dimanche'', November 27, 1960]]
The work was part of the second ''Festival d’Art d’Avant-Garde'' (''Festival of Avant-garde Art'') at the Palais des Expositions, Porte de Versailles, Paris. Taking the form of a parody of the French newspaper 'Journal du Dimanche', the Sunday edition of [[France Soir]], the book presents Klein’s ideas about the ''Théâtre du Vide'' (''Theatre of the Void'') and was the first time the famous photo ''Un Homme Dans L’Espace-Le Peintre de l’Espace se Jette Dans le Vide!'' (''Man In Space! The Painter of Space Throws Himself into The Void!'') was published.

According to Klein, the intention was to declare the entire 24-hour period an international theatrical happening, 'a holiday, a veritable spectacle of the void, at the culminating point of my theories.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Dimanche&lt;/ref&gt;' Merging art and life seamlessly, Klein's theatre would encapsulate each spectator's life as they lived it on that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coskunfineart.com/biography.asp?artistID=35 Yves Klein (1928 - 1962 - Biographical information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Several thousand copies were printed and distributed to news stands throughout Paris, with the help of Klein's friends. The artwork cost 0.35 [[French franc#The new franc|Francs]] and sold well.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Hannah Weitemeier, Taschen, p51&lt;/ref&gt;

==The book itself==

===The ''Leap into the Void''===
The most famous section of the book was the photographic collage, published with the caption 'The painter of space throws himself into the void! &lt;ref&gt;French; 'Le peintre de l'espace se jette dans le vide'&lt;/ref&gt;' but usually known as the ''Leap Into The Void''. This photomontage, taken by [[Harry Shunk]], was montaged from a number of photos. The leap itself took place at 3 Rue Gentil Bernard, Fontenay-Aux_Roses, in October 1960, using about a dozen [[Judoka]]s from a Judo School opposite, holding a large tarpaulin to land on.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p220&lt;/ref&gt; Klein himself was a 4th Dan Judo Master. Shunk then montaged a shot of the empty street onto the photo. In fact there were 3 versions of this photo produced; one with Klein’s 2CV was never used; the one with a train and a cyclist was used for Dimanche; the third with an empty street and without the train was requested by Klein himself the next day to be used in the forthcoming catalogue for his retrospective at [[Krefeld]]. This strategy of employing two versions of the same montage, effectively bringing attention to the deception was typical of Klein's artistic strategy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I am the painter of Space. I am not an abstract painter but, on the contrary, a figurative and realist painter. Let's be honest, in order to paint space, I must put myself on the spot, in space itself." Yves Klein, quoted underneath the photo 'Man In Space' on the front cover of Dimanche&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p217&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Theatre of the Void''===
As well as declarations of intent, the book contains a series of theatre pieces, ''Théâtre du Vide'' (''Theatre of the Void'') that prefigure various [[Fluxus|Fluxus scores]] of a kind that would later come to be known as [[happenings]].
Pieces contained within the book include;

''Sleep''; The setting is a bedroom. The scene opens with a man asleep in a big bed. The actor must really be sleeping. Each performance lasts about 10 minutes and in silence. There is to be applause at the end.

''Inversion''; For one performance, any play will be presented upside down. All the actors will have their feet on the ceiling and their heads hanging down. This will be possible by trickery. All the furniture will also be on the ceiling, which will really be the floor. A chandelier will therefore levitate in space.

''The Five Rooms''; In order to promote the feeling and matter without the intermediary of energy,  spectators pass through 5 rooms, their feet bound by ball and chain. 9 monochrome blue paintings of the same format are in the first room; the second room is empty and entirely white; nine monogold paintings of the same format are in the third room; the fourth room is empty and dark, almost black; 9 monopink paintings of the same format are in the fifth room.

''From Dizziness to Prestige''; Having practiced levitation and attempted a kind of purifying sublimation by which he would free himself from the exasperation of the ego, and having created or proposed various aerostatic sculptures that were free from the enslavement of pedestals, Klein presents himself on stage stretched out in space a few meters above the ground for 5 or 10 minutes. The performance takes place without commentary.

These pieces hover between the possible and the imaginary, establishing that the pieces aren’t meant to exist literally, but in the mind of the reader. This prefigures many of the concerns of [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name="weitemeier"&gt;Klein By Hannah Weitemeier, Taschen, p51&lt;/ref&gt; The book also contained a b/w reproduction of an [[International Klein Blue]] monochrome painting, and some sketches of [[Judo]] manoeuvres.

Whilst some of the pieces relate to earlier writings and statements by Klein, most were written in a hectic four-day period immediately prior to publication, in a bar with friends.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Berggruen, Hollein, Pfeiffer, Hatje Kantz&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[[Joseph Kosuth]] hailed him as the father of conceptual art; the [[fluxus]] movement, happenings, performances, and body art, each in its own way, was structurally related to [Klein's] work. What these streams had in common was an incentive to discover a mode of creativity that transcended national frontiers, to define its aesthetic criteria, and to disseminate the results. In this process, Klein figured in the classical role of emissary, heralding a new culture to come- invisible to the eye, yet universally present nonetheless." Hannah Weitemeier &lt;ref name="weitemeier"/&gt;

'''The Eight Views of Pyangyang''' are a collection of beautiful scenery of [[Pyongyang]], [[Korea]], that are alleged to have been handed down from the time of the [[Joseon]] dynasty, in the Korean poetry and paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.piks.or.tv/info/134.htm Eight Views of Pyongyang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914222852/http://www.piks.or.tv/info/134.htm |date=2007-09-14 }} (in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13574">[[File:Wainwright building st louis USA.jpg|thumb|The [[Wainwright Building]] in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], designed by [[Louis Sullivan]], is emblematic of his famous maxim "form follows function".|300x300px]]
'''Form follows function''' is a principle associated with 20th-century [[modern architecture|modernist architecture]] and [[industrial design]] which says that the shape of a building or object should primarily relate to its intended function or purpose.

== Origins of the phrase ==
The architect [[Louis Sullivan]] coined the [[Saying|maxim]], although it is often incorrectly attributed to the sculptor [[Horatio Greenough]] (1805{{en dash}}1852),&lt;ref&gt;Horatio Greenough, ''Form and Function: Remarks on Art'', edited by Harold A. Small (Berkeley, Univ. of California Press, 1947), although the theory of inherent forms, of which the ijaz phrase is a fitting summary, informs all of Greenough's writing on art, design, and architecture.

Greenough was in his architectural writings influenced by the [[transcendentalist]] thinking and the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] protestantism of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].&lt;/ref&gt; whose thinking mostly predates the later [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] approach to architecture. Greenough's writings were for a long time largely forgotten, and were rediscovered only in the 1930s. In 1947, a selection of his essays was published as ''Form and Function: Remarks on Art by Horatio Greenough''.

Sullivan was Greenough's much younger compatriot, and admired rationalist thinkers such as [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], [[Walt Whitman|Whitman]], and [[Herman Melville|Melville]], as well as Greenough himself. In 1896, Sullivan coined the phrase in an article titled ''The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/tallofficebuildi00sull|title=The tall office building artistically considered|last=Sullivan|first=Louis H.|date=1896|others=Getty Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he later attributed the core idea to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] architect, engineer, and author [[Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]], who first asserted in his book ''[[De architectura]]'' that a structure must exhibit the three qualities of firmitas, utilitas, venustas – that is, it must be solid, useful, beautiful.&lt;ref name="idea"&gt;{{cite book |title=Autobiography of an Idea |last=Sullivan |first=Louis |year=1924 |publisher=Press of the American institute of Architects, Inc. |location=New York City |page=108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan actually wrote "form ever follows function", but the simpler and less emphatic phrase is more widely remembered. For Sullivan this was distilled wisdom, an aesthetic credo, the single "rule that shall permit of no exception". The full quote is:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
"Whether it be the sweeping eagle in his flight, or the open apple-blossom, the toiling work-horse, the blithe swan, the branching oak, the winding stream at its base, the drifting clouds, over all the coursing sun, '''''form ever follows function''''', and this is the law.  Where function does not change, form does not change. The granite rocks, the ever-brooding hills, remain for ages; the lightning lives, comes into shape, and dies, in a twinkling. 
It is the pervading law of all things organic and inorganic, of all things physical and metaphysical, of all things human and all things superhuman, of all true manifestations of the head, of the heart, of the soul, that the life is recognizable in its expression, '''that form ever follows function.''' ''This is the law.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sullivan | first=Louis H. | title=The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered | journal=Lippincott's Magazine | issue=March 1896 | pages=403–409 | year=1896 |url= https://archive.org/details/tallofficebuildi00sull }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sullivan developed the shape of the tall steel [[skyscraper]] in late 19th Century [[Chicago]] at a moment in which technology, taste and economic forces converged and made it necessary to break with established styles. If the shape of the building was not going to be chosen out of the old pattern book, something had to determine form, and according to Sullivan it was going to be the purpose of the building. Thus, "form follows function", as opposed to "form follows precedent". Sullivan's assistant [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] adopted and professed the same principle in a slightly different form—perhaps because shaking off the old styles gave them more freedom and latitude.

== Debate on the functionality of ornamentation ==

In 1908, the Austrian architect [[Adolf Loos]] wrote an allegorical essay titled "[[Ornament and Crime]]" in reaction to the excessive invented ornament used by the [[Vienna Secession]] architects. Modernists adopted Loos's moralistic argument as well as Sullivan's maxim. Loos had worked as a carpenter in the USA. He celebrated efficient plumbing and industrial artifacts like corn silos and steel water towers as examples of functional design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Loos, A.|year=1908|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~art/Temporary_SL/177/pdfs/Loos.pdf|title=Ornament and Crime|location=Innsbruck, reprint Vienna, 1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary-inline|date=May 2014}}

== Application in different fields ==

=== Architecture ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
The phrase '''"form (ever) follows function"''' became a [[battle cry]] of Modernist architects after the 1930s. The credo was taken to imply that decorative elements, which architects call "ornament", were superfluous in modern buildings. However, Sullivan himself neither thought nor designed along such lines at the peak of his career. Indeed, while his buildings could be spare and crisp in their principal masses, he often punctuated their plain surfaces with eruptions of lush [[Art Nouveau|art nouveau]] and [[Celtic Revival|celtic revival]] decorations, usually cast in iron or terracotta, and ranging from organic forms like vines and ivy, to more geometric designs, and interlace, inspired by his Irish design heritage. Probably the most famous example is the writhing green ironwork that covers the entrance canopies of the [[Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building]] on South State Street in Chicago. These ornaments, often executed by the talented younger draftsman in Sullivan's employ, would eventually become Sullivan's trademark; to students of architecture, they are his instantly recognizable signature.

=== Product design ===

One episode in the history of the inherent conflict between functional design and the demands of the marketplace took place in 1935, after the introduction of the streamlined [[Chrysler Airflow]], when the American auto industry temporarily halted attempts to introduce optimal aerodynamic forms into mass manufacture. Some car-makers thought aerodynamic efficiency would result in a single optimal auto-body shape, a "teardrop" shape, which would not be good for unit sales.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Meikle's "Twentieth Century Limited:  Industrial Design in America, 1925 &amp;ndash; 1939"&lt;/ref&gt; [[General Motors]] adopted two different positions on streamlining, one meant for its internal engineering community, the other meant for its customers. Like the annual model year change, so-called aerodynamic styling is often meaningless in terms of technical performance. Subsequently, [[drag coefficient]] has become both a marketing tool and a means of improving the sale-ability of a car by reducing its fuel consumption, slightly, and increasing its top speed, markedly.

The American industrial designers of the 1930s and '40s like [[Raymond Loewy]], [[Norman bel Geddes]] and [[Henry Dreyfuss]] grappled with the inherent contradictions of "form follows function" as they redesigned blenders and locomotives and duplicating machines for mass-market consumption. Loewy formulated his &lt;span id="MAYA"&gt;"MAYA" (Most Advanced Yet Acceptable)&lt;/span&gt; principle to express that product designs are bounded by functional constraints of math and materials and logic, but their acceptance is constrained by social expectations. His advice was that for very new technologies, they should be made as familiar as possible, but for familiar technologies, they should be made surprising.

By honestly applying "form follows function", industrial designers had the potential to put their clients out of business.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Some simple single-purpose objects like screwdrivers and pencils and teapots might be reducible to a single optimal form, precluding [[product differentiation]]. Some objects made too durable would prevent sales of replacements. (''cf.'' [[planned obsolescence]]) From the standpoint of functionality, some products are simply unnecessary.

[[Victor Papanek]] (died 1998) was an influential recent designer and design philosopher who taught and wrote as a proponent of "form follows function."

=== Software engineering ===
It has been argued that the structure and internal quality attributes of a working, non-trivial software artifact will represent first and foremost the engineering requirements of its construction, with the influence of process being marginal, if any. This does not mean that process is irrelevant, but that processes compatible with an artifact's requirements lead to roughly similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle can also be applied to Enterprise Application Architectures of modern business where "function" is the Business processes which should be assisted by the enterprise architecture, or "form". If the architecture dictates how the business operates then the business is likely to suffer from inflexibility unable to adapt to change. SOA [[Service-Oriented Architecture]] enables an [[Enterprise Architect]] to rearrange the "form" of the architecture to meet the functional requirements of a business by adopting standards based communication protocols which enable interoperability.

Furthermore, [[Domain-Driven Design]] postulates that structure ([[Software architecture]], [[Design Pattern]], [[Implementation]]) should emerge from constraints of the modeled domain ([[Functional requirement]]).

While "form" and "function" may be more or less explicit and invariant concepts to the many engineering doctrines, [[Metaprogramming]] and the [[Functional programming]] paradigm lend themselves very well to explore, blur and invert the essence of those two concepts.

The [[Agile software development]] movement espouses techniques such as 'test driven development' in which the engineer begins with a minimum unit of user oriented functionality, creates an automated test for such and then implements the functionality and iterates, repeating this process. The result and argument for this discipline are that the structure or 'form' emerges from actual function and in fact because done organically, makes the project more adaptable long term as well of as higher quality because of the functional base of automated tests.

=== Automobile designing ===

If the design of an automobile conforms to its function—for instance the [[Fiat Multipla]]'s shape, which is partly due to the desire to sit six people in two rows—then its form is said to follow its function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/19990719/ANE/907190815/multipla-designer-shows-that-form-follows-function|title=MULTIPLA DESIGNER SHOWS THAT FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION|work=Automotive News|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution ===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
According to [[Lamarck]]'s long-discredited [[Lamarckism|theory of evolution]], anatomy will be structured according to functions associated with use; for instance, [[giraffe]]s are taller to reach the leaves of [[tree]]s. By contrast, in [[evolution|Darwinian evolution]], form ([[mutation|variation]]) ''precedes'' function (as determined by [[natural selection|selection]]). This is to say, in Lamarckian evolution the form is altered by the required function, whereas in Darwinian evolution small variations in form allow some parts of the population to function "better", and are therefore more successful reproductively.

'''''Frozen''''' is a play by [[Bryony Lavery]] that tells the story of the disappearance of a 10-year-old girl, Rhona.  The play follows Rhona's mother and killer over the years that follow.  They are linked by a doctor who is studying what causes men to commit such crimes.  The themes of the play include emotional paralysis and forgiveness.

==Productions==
The play was first performed at [[Birmingham Repertory Theatre]] in 1998 and won the Best New Play Award from the Theatrical Management Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kate Kellaway |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/jun/23/features.review27 |title=Interview with Bryony Lavery, author of Frozen &amp;#124; From the Observer &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= June 23, 2002|accessdate=2011-10-27 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It later made its debut at the Royal National Theatre's Cottesloe Theatre on 3 July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/8213/past-events/past-productions-20012003.html |title=Past productions 2001-2003 - Past Events |publisher=National Theatre |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The play was revived at The [[Theatre Royal Haymarket]] starring [[Jason Watkins (actor)|Jason Watkins]], [[Suranne Jones]] and [[Nina Sosanya]] for a strictly limited season from February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trh.co.uk/whatson/frozen/&lt;/ref&gt;

''Frozen'' opened [[Off-Broadway]] in February 2004 at the Manhattan Class Company Theatre starring [[Swoosie Kurtz]], [[Brian F. O'Byrne]] and [[Laila Robins]]. It transferred to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in May and closed in August 2004.&lt;ref name=talkin&gt;[http://www.talkinbroadway.com/regional/sfla/sfla52.html "Talkin' Broadway Regional News &amp; Reviews - "Frozen" in Southern Florida"] talkinbroadway.com, October 24, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; ''Frozen'' was nominated for a [[Tony Award for Best Play]] in 2004, and earned a [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play]] (Brian F. O'Byrne).

==Plot and characters==
The story is set in present-day [[England]] and involves three main characters: a [[serial killer]] named Ralph, who kidnaps and murders a young girl; the murdered girl's mother, Nancy; a New York [[psychiatrist]], Agnetha, who travels to England to examine Ralph. The three lives slowly intersect &amp;mdash; and the characters gradually change and become "unfrozen" as they come to terms with the idea of forgiveness. 

The script begins in [[monologue]]s, each person showing his or her side of the story; the audience sees each person's story intertwine as they connect with one another.

==Allegations of plagiarism==
In September 2004, papers around the world (including ''[[The Times (London)|The Times]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'', the ''[[New York Times]]'', and the [[Associated Press]]) reported that Lavery had allegedly [[plagiarism|plagiarized]] significant portions (nearly 675 words) of the play from a 1997 ''[[The New Yorker]]'' article by [[Malcolm Gladwell]] about psychiatrist [[Dorothy Otnow Lewis|Dorothy Lewis]], and from Lewis' own 1998 book ''Guilty by Reason of Insanity.'' 

Lewis claimed that ''Frozen'' was based in large part on her life and that the play lifted both themes and verbatim passages from both sources.  However, after interviewing Lavery, Gladwell wrote a second ''New Yorker'' article in which he characterized Lavery’s appropriation as "permissible borrowing." Lavery, for her part, acknowledged that all three characters were drawn heavily from external sources. For the character of Ralph, she drew on the book ''[[The Murder of Childhood]]'' by Ray Wyre and Tim Tate. For the character of Nancy, she drew on an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' by Marian Partington, whose sister Lucy had been murdered by the serial killers [[Fred West|Fred and Rosemary West]]. And, for the character of Agnetha, Lavery drew on the Gladwell article. "I wanted [the play] to be accurate", she told Gladwell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gladwell.com/something-borrowed/ Gladwell - Something Borrowed] Nov 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
*"[A] big, brave, compassionate play about [[grief]], revenge, forgiveness and bearing the unbearable." -- ''[[The Guardian]]''

The ''TalkinBroadway'' reviewer of a Florida production wrote: "[A] powerful drama ... about three people living the human condition... a story that needs to continue to be told."&lt;ref name=talkin/&gt;

[[Image:CIExy1931 srgb gamut.png|240px|right|thumb|'''Typical CRT gamut'''&lt;br&gt;The grayed-out horseshoe shape is the entire range of possible [[chromaticity|chromaticities]], displayed in the [[CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram]] format (see below). The colored triangle is the gamut available to the [[sRGB]] color space typically used in computer monitors; it does not cover the entire space. The corners of the triangle are the [[primary color]]s for this gamut; in the case of a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], they depend on the colors of the phosphors of the monitor. At each point, the brightest possible RGB color of that chromaticity is shown, resulting in the bright [[Mach band]] stripes corresponding to the edges of the RGB color cube.]]
In color reproduction, including [[computer graphics]] and [[photography]], the '''gamut''', or '''color gamut''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|æ|m|ə|t}}, is a certain ''complete subset'' of [[color]]s. The most common usage refers to the subset of colors which can be accurately represented in a given circumstance, such as within a given [[color space]] or by a certain [[output device]].

Another sense, less frequently used but still correct, refers to the complete set of colors found within an image at a given time. In this context, digitizing a photograph, converting a digitized image to a different color space, or outputting it to a given medium using a certain output device generally alters its gamut, in the sense that some of the colors in the original are lost in the process.

==Introduction==
The term ''gamut'' was adopted from the field of music, where it means the set of pitches of which musical melodies are composed; [[Shakespeare]]'s use of the term in ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' is sometimes attributed to the author/musician [[Thomas Morley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Long |first1=John H. |title=Shakespeare and Thomas Morley |journal=Modern Language Notes |date=1950 |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=17–22 |doi=10.2307/2909321 |jstor=2909321}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, the term was applied to a range of colors or hue, for example by [[Thomas De Quincey]], who wrote "[[Porphyry (geology)|Porphyry]], I have heard, runs through as large a gamut of hues as marble."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = De Quincey's works | author = Thomas De Quincey | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5TACAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=gamut-of-hues+date:0-1856#PPA35,M1 | publisher = James R. Osgood | year = 1854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[color theory]], the gamut of a device or process is that portion of the [[color space]] that can be represented, or reproduced.  Generally, the color gamut is specified in the [[hue]]–[[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]] plane, as a system can usually produce colors over a wide [[intensity (disambiguation)|intensity]] range within its color gamut; for a [[subtractive color]] system (such as used in [[printing]]), the range of intensity available in the system is for the most part meaningless without considering system-specific properties (such as the [[Optics|illumination]] of the ink).

When certain colors cannot be expressed within a particular color model, those colors are said to be ''out of gamut''. For example, while pure [[red]] can be expressed in the [[RGB]] color space, it cannot be expressed in the [[CMYK]] color space; pure red is out of gamut in the [[CMYK]] color space.

A device that can reproduce the entire visible color space is an unrealized goal within the [[engineering]] of [[Display device|color displays]] and printing processes. Modern techniques allow increasingly good approximations, but the complexity of these systems often makes them impractical.

While processing a digital image, the most convenient color model used is the RGB model. Printing the image requires transforming the image from the original RGB color space to the printer's CMYK color space. During this process, the colors from the RGB which are out of gamut must be somehow converted to approximate values within the CMYK space gamut. Simply trimming only the colors which are out of gamut to the closest colors in the destination space would [[burned (image)|burn]] the image. There are several algorithms approximating this transformation, but none of them can be truly perfect, since those colors are simply out of the target device's capabilities. This is why identifying the colors in an image which are out of gamut in the target color space as soon as possible during processing is critical for the quality of the final product.

==Representation of gamuts==

Gamuts are commonly represented as areas in the [[CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram]] as shown at right, with the curved edge representing the [[monochromatic]] (single-wavelength) or [[spectral color]]s.

The accessible gamut depends on the brightness; a full gamut must therefore be represented in 3D space, as below:

The pictures at left show the gamuts of RGB color space (top), such as on computer monitors, and of reflective colors in nature (bottom). The cone drawn in grey corresponds roughly to the CIE diagram at right, with the added dimension of brightness.

The axes in these diagrams are the responses of the short-wavelength (''S''), middle-wavelength (''M''), and long-wavelength (''L'') cones in the [[human eye]]. The other letters indicate black (''Blk''), red (''R''), green (''G''), blue (''B''), cyan (''C''), magenta (''M''), yellow (''Y''), and white colors (''W''). (Note: These pictures are not exactly to scale.)

The top left diagram shows that the shape of the RGB gamut is a triangle between red, green, and blue at lower luminosities; a triangle between cyan, magenta, and yellow at higher luminosities, and a single white point at maximum luminosity. The exact positions of the apexes depends on the emission spectra of the [[phosphor]]s in the computer monitor, and on the ratio between the maximum luminosities of the three phosphors (i.e., the color balance).

The gamut of the CMYK color space is, ideally, approximately the same as that for RGB, with slightly different apexes, depending on both the exact properties of the dyes and the light source. In practice, due to the way raster-printed colors interact with each other and the paper and due to their non-ideal absorption spectra, the gamut is smaller and has rounded corners.

The gamut of reflective colors in nature has a similar, though more rounded, shape. An object that reflects only a narrow band of wavelengths will have a color close to the edge of the CIE diagram, but it will have a very low luminosity at the same time. At higher luminosities, the accessible area in the CIE diagram becomes smaller and smaller, up to a single point of white, where all wavelengths are reflected exactly 100 per cent; the exact coordinates of white are determined by the color of the light source.

==Limitations of color representation==
===Surfaces===
[[Image:Rechteckspektrum sRGB.svg|right|thumb|300px|Spectrum of a color-optimal reflective material.]]
[[Image:Optimal-color-solid,FL4,XYZ.gif|right|frame|MacAdam limits for illuminant [[Standard illuminant#Illuminant series F|CIE FL4]] in CIE xyY.]]

In the beginning of the 20th century, industrial demands for a controllable way to describe colors and the new possibility to measure light spectra initiated intense research on mathematical descriptions of colors.

The idea of optimal colors was introduced by the Baltic German chemist [[Wilhelm Ostwald]]. [[Erwin Schrödinger]] showed in his 1919 article ''{{lang|de|Theorie der Pigmente von größter Leuchtkraft}}'' (Theory of Pigments with Highest Luminosity)&lt;ref name=sch&gt;{{cite journal | last = Schrödinger | first = Erwin | title = Theorie der Pigmente größter Leuchtkraft | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 367  | issue = 15 | pages = 603–622 | year = 1919 | doi = 10.1002/andp.19203671504|bibcode = 1920AnP...367..603S }}&lt;/ref&gt; that the most-saturated colors that can be created with a given total reflectivity are generated by surfaces having either zero or full reflectance at any given wavelength, and the reflectivity spectrum must have at most two transitions between zero and full. Thus two types of "optimal color" spectra are possible: Either the transition goes from zero at both ends of the spectrum to one in the middle, as shown in the image at right, or it goes from one at the ends to zero in the middle. The first type produces colors that are similar to the spectral colors and follow roughly the horseshoe-shaped portion of the [[Chromaticity diagram#The CIE xy chromaticity diagram|CIE xy chromaticity diagram]], but are generally less saturated. The second type produces colors that are similar to (but generally less saturated than) the colors on the straight line in the [[Chromaticity diagram#The CIE xy chromaticity diagram|CIE xy chromaticity diagram]], leading to magenta-like colors. Schrödinger's work was further developed by [[David MacAdam]] and [[Siegfried Rösch]].&lt;ref name=lee&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CzAbJrLin_AC&amp;pg=PA469&amp;dq=Introduction+to+Color+Imaging+Science+%22optimal+color%22 |title=Introduction to Color Imaging Science|first=Hsien-Che|last=Lee|page=468|chapter=18.7: Theoretical color gamut|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=0-521-84388-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacAdam was the first person to calculate precise coordinates of selected points on the boundary of the optimal color solid in the CIE 1931 color space for lightness levels from Y = 10 to 95 in steps of 10 units. This enabled him to draw the optimal color solid at an acceptable degree of precision. Because of his achievement, the boundary of the optimal color solid is called the ''MacAdam limit''. On modern computers, it is possible to calculate an optimal color solid with great precision in seconds or minutes. The MacAdam limit, on which the most saturated (or "optimal") colors reside, shows that colors that are near monochromatic colors can only be achieved at very low luminance levels, except for yellows, because a mixture of the wavelengths from the long straight-line portion of the spectral locus between green and red will combine to make a color very close to a monochromatic yellow.

===Light sources===
Light sources used as primaries in an additive color reproduction system need to be bright, so they are generally not close to monochromatic.  That is, the color gamut of most variable-color light sources can be understood as a result of difficulties producing pure [[monochromatic]] (single [[wavelength]]) light.  The best technological source of monochromatic light is the [[laser]], which can be rather expensive and impractical for many systems. However, as [[optoelectronic]] technology matures, single-longitudinal-mode diode lasers are becoming less expensive, and many applications can already profit from this; such as Raman spectroscopy, holography, biomedical research, fluorescence, reprographics, interferometry, semiconductor inspection, remote detection, optical data storage, image recording, spectral analysis, printing, point-to-point free-space communications, and fiber optic communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalaser.com/laser/single-frequency-laser.html |title=Single Frequency Laser - Single Longitudinal Mode Laser |deadurl=no |accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jdsu.com/en-us/Lasers/Products/A-Z-Product-List/Pages/diode-laser-810-or-830-or-852nm-50-200mw-single-mode-54xx-series.aspx |title=JDSU - Diode Laser, 810 or 830 or 852 nm, 50-200 mW, Single-Mode (54xx Series) |deadurl=no |accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laserglow.com/S53 |title=Laserglow Technologies - Handheld Lasers, Alignment Lasers and Lab / OEM Lasers |deadurl=no |accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fiberoptics4sale.com/wordpress/laser-diode-characteristics/ |title=Laser Diode Characteristics |deadurl=no |accessdate=26 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems that use additive color processes usually have a color gamut which is roughly a [[convex polygon]] in the hue-saturation plane. The vertices of the polygon are the most saturated colors the system can produce. In subtractive color systems, the color gamut is more often an irregular region.

Following is a list of representative color systems more-or-less ordered from large to small color gamut:

* [[Laser video projector]] uses 3 lasers to produce the broadest gamut available in practical display equipment today, derived from the fact that lasers produce truly monochromatic primaries. The systems work either by scanning the entire picture a dot at a time and modulating the laser directly at high frequency, much like the electron beams in a [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]], or by optically spreading and then modulating the laser and scanning a line at a time, the line itself being modulated in much the same way as in a [[Digital Light Processing|DLP]] projector.  Lasers can also be used as a light source for a DLP projector.&lt;!-- ref to Mitsubishi DLPs --&gt;  More than 3 lasers can be combined to increase the gamut range, a technique sometimes used in [[holography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=ao-47-4-A123 | title = Color holography to produce highly realistic three-dimensional images}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Digital Light Processing]] or DLP technology is a trademarked technology from Texas Instruments. The DLP chip contains a rectangular array of up to 2 million hinge-mounted microscopic mirrors. Each of the micromirrors measures less than one-fifth the width of a human hair. A DLP chip's micromirror tilts either toward the light source in a DLP projection system (ON) or away from it (OFF). This creates a light or dark pixel on the projection surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dlp.com/technology/how-dlp-works/default.aspx | title = DLP Technology | accessdate = 2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current DLP projectors use a quickly rotating wheel with transparent colored "pie slices" to present each color frame successively. One rotation shows the complete image.
* [[Photographic film]] can reproduce a larger color gamut than typical television, computer, or [[home video]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamutvision.com/docs/camera_scanner.html | title = Film gamut, apples, and oranges | accessdate = 2007-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[cathode ray tube|CRT]] and similar video displays have a roughly triangular color gamut which covers a significant portion of the visible color space.  In CRTs, the limitations are due to the phosphors in the screen which produce red, green, and blue light.
* [[Liquid crystal display]] (LCD) screens filter the light emitted by a [[backlight]]. The gamut of an LCD screen is therefore limited to the emitted spectrum of the backlight. Typical LCD screens use cold-cathode fluorescent bulbs ([[CCFL]]s) for backlights. LCD Screens with certain [[light-emitting diode|LED]] or wide-gamut CCFL backlights yield a more comprehensive gamut than CRTs. However, some LCD technologies vary the color presented by viewing angle. [[In Plane Switching]] or [[Patterned vertical alignment]] screens have a wider span of colors than [[Twisted nematic field effect|Twisted Nematic]].
* [[Television]] normally uses a CRT, LCD or [[Plasma display|plasma]] display, but does not take full advantage of its color display properties, due to the limitations of [[broadcasting]].  [[High-definition television|HDTV]] is less restrictive{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}, but still somewhat less than, for example, computer displays using the same display technology.
* [[Paint]] mixing, both artistic and for commercial applications, achieves a reasonably large color gamut by starting with a larger palette than the red, green, and blue of CRTs or cyan, magenta, and yellow of printing.  Paint may reproduce some highly saturated colors that cannot be reproduced well by CRTs (particularly violet), but overall the color gamut is smaller.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
* [[Printing]] typically uses the [[CMYK]] color space (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black). Very few printing processes do not include black; however, those processes (with the exception of [[dye-sublimation printer]]s) are poor at representing low saturation, low intensity colors. Efforts have been made to expand the gamut of the printing process by adding inks of non-primary colors; these are typically orange and green (see [[Hexachrome]]) or light cyan and light magenta (see [[CcMmYK color model]]). [[Spot color]] inks of a very specific color are also sometimes used.
* A [[monochrome]] display's color gamut is a one-dimensional curve in color space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OQffvaCaZlgC&amp;pg=PA137&amp;dq=A+monochrome+display+color+gamut+is+a+one-dimensional+curve+in+color+space.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvoKnhxIzVAhUX9mMKHQ92D1cQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20monochrome%20display%20color%20gamut%20is%20a%20one-dimensional%20curve%20in%20color%20space.&amp;f=false|title=Image Processing for Computer Graphics and Vision|last=Velho|first=Luiz|last2=Frery|first2=Alejandro C.|last3=Gomes|first3=Jonas|date=2009-04-29|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781848001930|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wide color gamut==
The [[Ultra HD Forum]] defines wide color gamut (WCG) as a color gamut that is wider than [[Rec. 709]].&lt;ref name=PhaseAGudelinesJuly2016UltraHDForum&gt;{{cite news |title=Ultra HD Forum: Phase A Guidelines |publisher=Ultra HD Forum |url=http://ultrahdforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Ultra-HD-Forum-Deployment-Guidelines-V1.1-Summer-2016.pdf |format=PDF |date=2016-07-15 |accessdate=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; WCG would include [[DCI-P3]] and [[Rec. 2020]].&lt;ref name=PhaseAGudelinesJuly2016UltraHDForum/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], two quantities are in the '''golden ratio''' if their [[ratio]] is the same as the ratio of their [[summation|sum]] to the larger of the two quantities. The figure on the right illustrates the geometric relationship. The golden ratio is also called the '''golden mean''' or '''golden section''' (Latin: ''sectio aurea'').{{sfn|Livio|2003|pp=3, 81}}&lt;ref name="Sadowski"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dunlap"&gt;Richard A Dunlap, ''The Golden Ratio and Fibonacci Numbers'', World Scientific Publishing, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Other names include '''extreme and mean ratio''',&lt;ref name="Elements 6.3"&gt;Euclid, ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', [https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVI/defVI3.html Book 6, Definition 3].&lt;/ref&gt; '''medial section''', '''divine proportion''', '''divine section''' (Latin: ''sectio divina''), '''golden proportion''', '''golden cut''',&lt;ref&gt;Summerson John, ''Heavenly Mansions: And Other Essays on Architecture'' (New York: W.W.

The sole value of these ratios is that they are intellectually fruitful and suggest the rhythms of modular design."&lt;/ref&gt; and '''golden number'''.&lt;ref&gt;Jay Hambidge, ''Dynamic Symmetry: The Greek Vase'', New Haven CT: Yale University Press, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Lidwell, Kritina Holden, Jill Butler, ''Universal Principles of Design: A Cross-Disciplinary Reference'', Gloucester MA: Rockport Publishers, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pacioli"&gt;Pacioli, Luca.

[[Mathematician]]s since [[Euclid]] have studied the properties of the golden ratio, including its appearance in the dimensions of a [[regular pentagon]] and in a golden rectangle, which may be cut into a square and a smaller rectangle with the same [[aspect ratio]]. The golden ratio has also been used to analyze the proportions of natural objects as well as man-made systems such as [[financial market]]s, in some cases based on dubious fits to data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Steven|last=Strogatz|authorlink=Steven Strogatz|title=Me, Myself, and Math: Proportion Control|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 24, 2012|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/24/proportion-control/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden ratio appears in some [[patterns in nature]], including the [[phyllotaxis|spiral arrangement of leaves]] and other plant parts.

Some twentieth-century [[artist]]s and [[architect]]s, including [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Salvador Dalí]], have proportioned their works to approximate the golden ratio—especially in the form of the [[golden rectangle]], in which the ratio of the longer side to the shorter is the golden ratio—believing this proportion to be [[aesthetics|aesthetically]] pleasing.

==History==
{{further|Fibonacci number#Origins}}

The golden ratio has a wide range of demonstrations throughout history. According to [[Mario Livio]]:
{{quote|Some of the greatest mathematical minds of all ages, from [[Pythagoras]] and [[Euclid]] in [[ancient Greece]], through the medieval Italian mathematician &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Fibonacci]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the Renaissance astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]], to present-day scientific figures such as Oxford physicist [[Roger Penrose]], have spent endless hours over this simple ratio and its properties. ... it is probably fair to say that the Golden Ratio has inspired thinkers of all disciplines like no other number in the history of mathematics.{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=6}}}}

[[File:Pentagram-phi.svg|right|thumb|A pentagram colored to distinguish its line segments of different lengths. The four

==Applications and observations==

===Aesthetics===
{{See also|History of aesthetics (pre-20th-century)|Mathematics and art}}

''De Divina Proportione'', a three-volume work by [[Luca Pacioli]], was published in 1509. Pacioli, a [[Franciscan]] [[friar]], was known mostly as a mathematician, but he was also trained and keenly interested in art. ''De Divina Proportione'' explored the mathematics of the golden ratio. Though it is often said that Pacioli advocated the golden ratio's application to yield pleasing, harmonious proportions, Livio points out that the interpretation has been traced to an error in 1799, and that Pacioli actually advocated the [[Vitruvius|Vitruvian]] system of rational proportions.{{sfn|Livio|2003|pp=134-35}} Pacioli also saw Catholic religious significance in the ratio, which led to his work's title. ''De Divina Proportione'' contains illustrations of regular solids by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], Pacioli's longtime friend and collaborator; these are not directly linked to the golden ratio.

[[File:7234014 Parthenonas (cropped).jpg|thumb|x150px|right|Many of the proportions of the [[Parthenon]] are alleged to exhibit the golden ratio.]]

The [[Parthenon]]'s façade as well as elements of its façade are said by some to be circumscribed by golden rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;Van Mersbergen, Audrey M., "Rhetorical Prototypes in Architecture: Measuring the Acropolis with a Philosophical Polemic", ''Communication Quarterly'', Vol. 46 No. 2, 1998, pp 194–213.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars deny that the Greeks had any aesthetic association with the golden ratio. For example, Midhat J. Gazalé says, "It was not until Euclid, however, that the golden ratio's mathematical properties were studied. In the ''Elements'' (308&amp;nbsp;BC) the Greek mathematician merely regarded that number as an interesting irrational number, in connection with the middle and extreme ratios. Its occurrence in regular pentagons and [[decagon]]s was duly observed, as well as in the [[dodecahedron]]".&lt;ref&gt;Midhat J. Gazalé , ''Gnomon'', Princeton University Press, 1999. {{isbn|0-691-00514-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Keith Devlin]] says, "Certainly, the oft repeated assertion that the Parthenon in Athens is based on the golden ratio is not supported by actual measurements. In fact, the entire story about the Greeks and golden ratio seems to be without foundation. The one thing we know for sure is that Euclid, in his famous textbook ''Elements'', written around 300&amp;nbsp;BC, showed how to calculate its value."&lt;ref&gt;Keith J. Devlin ''The Math Instinct: Why You're A Mathematical Genius (Along With Lobsters, Birds, Cats, And Dogs)'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=eRD9gYk2r6oC&amp;pg=PA108 p.&amp;nbsp;108]. New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 2005, {{isbn|1-56025-672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later sources like [[Vitruvius]] exclusively discuss proportions that can be expressed in whole numbers, i.e. commensurate as opposed to irrational proportions. One researcher concluded that the golden ratio was totally absent from Greek architecture of the classical fifth century&amp;nbsp;BC, and almost absent during the following six centuries, based on measurements of 15 temples, 18 monumental tombs, 8 sarcophagi, and 58 grave stelae.&lt;ref&gt;Patrice Foutakis, "Did the Greeks Build According to the Golden Ratio?", ''Cambridge Archaeological Journal'', vol. 24, n° 1, February 2014, pp.&amp;nbsp;71–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent book, author Jason Elliot speculated that the golden ratio was used by the designers of the [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]] and the adjacent Lotfollah mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author = Jason Elliot | title = Mirrors of the Unseen: Journeys in Iran | year = 2006 | pages = 277, 284 | publisher = Macmillan | isbn = 978-0-312-30191-0 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=Gcs4IjUx3-4C&amp;pg=PA284}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 geometrical analysis of earlier research into the [[Mosque of Oqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] reveals a consistent application of the golden ratio throughout the design, according to Boussora and Mazouz.&lt;ref&gt;Boussora, Kenza and Mazouz, Said, ''The Use of the Golden Section in the Great Mosque of Kairouan'', Nexus Network Journal, vol. 6 no. 1 (Spring 2004), [http://www.emis.de/journals/NNJ/BouMaz.html]&lt;/ref&gt; They found ratios close to the golden ratio in the overall proportion of the plan and in the dimensioning of the prayer space, the court, and the [[minaret]]. The authors note, however, that the areas where ratios close to the golden ratio were found are not part of the original construction, and theorize that these elements were added in a reconstruction.

The Swiss [[architect]] [[Le Corbusier]], famous for his contributions to the [[modernism|modern]] [[International Style (architecture)|international style]], centered his design philosophy on systems of harmony and proportion. Le Corbusier's faith in the mathematical order of the universe was closely bound to the golden ratio and the Fibonacci series, which he described as "rhythms apparent to the eye and clear in their relations with one another. And these rhythms are at the very root of human activities. They resound in man by an organic inevitability, the same fine inevitability which causes the tracing out of the Golden Section by children, old men, savages and the learned."&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'' p.&amp;nbsp;25, as cited in Padovan, Richard, ''Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture'' (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;316, Taylor and Francis, {{isbn|0-419-22780-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Frings: The Golden Section in Architectural Theory, Nexus Network Journal vol. 4 no. 1 (Winter 2002), available online [http://belveduto.de/text-nnj.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|Leonardo da Vinci's ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'']]
Le Corbusier explicitly used the golden ratio in his [[Modulor]] system for the [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[Proportion (architecture)|architectural proportion]]. He saw this system as a continuation of the long tradition of Vitruvius, [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and others who used the proportions of the human body to improve the appearance and function of [[architecture]]. In addition to the golden ratio, Le Corbusier based the system on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], [[Fibonacci number]]s, and the double unit. He took suggestion of the golden ratio in human proportions to an extreme: he sectioned his model human body's height at the navel with the two sections in golden ratio, then subdivided those sections in golden ratio at the knees and throat; he used these golden ratio proportions in the [[Modulor]] system. Le Corbusier's 1927 Villa Stein in [[Garches]] exemplified the Modulor system's application. The villa's rectangular ground plan, elevation, and inner structure closely approximate golden rectangles.&lt;ref&gt;Le Corbusier, ''The Modulor'', p.&amp;nbsp;35, as cited in Padovan, Richard, ''Proportion: Science, Philosophy, Architecture'' (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;320. Taylor &amp; Francis. {{isbn|0-419-22780-6}}: "Both the paintings and the architectural designs make use of the golden section".&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Swiss architect, [[Mario Botta]], bases many of his designs on geometric figures. Several private houses he designed in Switzerland are composed of squares and circles, cubes and cylinders. In a house he designed in [[Origlio]], the golden ratio is the proportion between the central section and the side sections of the house.&lt;ref&gt;Urwin, Simon.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a time when deviations from the truly beautiful page proportions 2:3, 1:√3, and the Golden Section were rare. Many books produced between 1550 and 1770 show these proportions exactly, to within half a millimeter.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Design===
Some sources claim that the golden ratio is commonly used in everyday design, for example in the shapes of postcards, playing cards, posters, wide-screen televisions, photographs, light switch plates and cars.&lt;ref&gt;

===Music===
[[Ernő Lendvai]] analyzes [[Béla Bartók]]'s works as being based on two opposing systems, that of the golden ratio and the [[acoustic scale]],&lt;ref&gt;Lendvai, Ernő (1971). ''Béla Bartók: An Analysis of His Music''. London: Kahn and Averill.&lt;/ref&gt; though other music scholars reject that analysis.{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=190}} French composer [[Erik Satie]] used the golden ratio in several of his pieces, including ''[[Sonneries de la Rose+Croix]]''. The golden ratio is also apparent in the organization of the sections in the music of [[Debussy]]'s ''[[Reflets dans l'eau]] (Reflections in Water)'', from ''Images'' (1st series, 1905), in which "the sequence of keys is marked out by the intervals 34, 21, 13 and 8, and the main climax sits at the phi position".&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;Smith, Peter F.

[[Adolf Zeising]], whose main interests were mathematics and philosophy, found the golden ratio expressed in the [[phyllotaxis|arrangement of parts]] such as leaves and branches along the stems of plants and of [[Leaf#Veins|veins]] in leaves. He extended his research to the [[skeleton]]s of animals and the branchings of their veins and nerves, to the proportions of chemical compounds and the geometry of [[crystal]]s, even to the use of proportion in artistic endeavors. In these [[patterns in nature]] he saw the golden ratio operating as a universal law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Proportion

Since 1991, several researchers have proposed connections between the golden ratio and [[human genome]] [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;J.C. Perez (1991), [http://golden-ratio-in-dna.blogspot.com/2008/01/1991-first-publication-related-to.html "Chaos DNA and Neuro-computers: A Golden Link"], in ''Speculations in Science and Technology'' vol. 14 no. 4, {{ISSN|0155-7785}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yamagishi, Michel E.B., and Shimabukuro, Alex I.

However, some have argued that many apparent manifestations of the golden ratio in nature, especially in regard to animal dimensions, are fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;Pommersheim, James E., Tim K. Marks, and [[Erica Flapan|Erica L. Flapan]], eds. 2010. "Number Theory: A Lively Introduction with Proofs, Applications, and Stories". John Wiley and Sons: 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perceptual studies===
Studies by psychologists, starting with [[Gustav Fechner]], have been devised to test the idea that the golden ratio plays a role in human perception of [[beauty]]. While Fechner found a preference for rectangle ratios centered on the golden ratio, later attempts to test such a hypothesis have been inconclusive.{{sfn|Livio|2003|p=7}}&lt;ref name=livio/&gt;

===Disputed observations===
Examples of disputed observations of the golden ratio include the following:
*Historian [[John Man (author)|John Man]] states that the pages of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] were "based on the golden section shape". However, according to Man's own measurements, the ratio of height to width was 1.45.&lt;ref&gt;Man, John, ''Gutenberg: How One Man Remade the World with Word'' (2002) pp. 166–167, Wiley, {{isbn|0-471-21823-5}}. "The half-folio page (30.7 × 44.5 cm) was made up of two rectangles—the whole page and its text area—based on the so called 'golden section', which specifies a crucial relationship between short and long sides, and produces an irrational number, as pi is, but is a ratio of about 5:8."&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some specific proportions in the bodies of many animals (including humans)&lt;ref name=pheasant&gt;{{Cite book |first=Stephen |last=Pheasant |title=Bodyspace |location=London |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1998 |isbn=0-7484-0067-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vanLaack&gt;{{Cite book |first=Walter |last=van Laack |title=A Better History Of Our World: Volume 1 The Universe |location=Aachen |publisher=van Laach GmbH |year=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and parts of the shells of mollusks&lt;ref name="dunlap"/&gt; are often claimed to be in the golden ratio. There is a large variation in the real measures of these elements in specific individuals, however, and the proportion in question is often significantly different from the golden ratio.&lt;ref name=pheasant/&gt; The ratio of successive phalangeal bones of the digits and the metacarpal bone has been said to approximate the golden ratio.&lt;ref name=vanLaack/&gt; The [[nautilus]] shell, the construction of which proceeds in a [[logarithmic spiral]], is often cited, usually with the idea that any logarithmic spiral is related to the golden ratio, but sometimes with the claim that each new chamber is proportioned by the golden ratio relative to the previous one;&lt;ref name=moscovich&gt;[[Ivan Moscovich]], ''Ivan Moscovich Mastermind Collection: The Hinged Square &amp; Other Puzzles,'' New York: Sterling, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; however, measurements of nautilus shells do not support this claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Sea shell spirals|last=Peterson|first=Ivars|journal=Science News|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/6030/title/Sea_Shell_Spirals}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In investing, some practitioners of [[technical analysis]] use the golden ratio to indicate support of a price level, or resistance to price increases, of a stock or commodity; after significant price changes up or down, new support and resistance levels are supposedly found at or near prices related to the starting price via the golden ratio.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Osler writes that "38.2 percent and 61.8 percent retracements of recent rises or declines are common," in {{Cite journal|author=Osler, Carol|title=Support for Resistance: Technical Analysis and Intraday Exchange Rates|journal=Federal Reserve Bank of New York Economic Policy Review|year=2000|volume=6|issue=2|pages= 53–68| url=http://ftp.ny.frb.org/research/epr/00v06n2/0007osle.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the golden ratio in investing is also related to more complicated patterns described by [[Fibonacci numbers]] (e.g. [[Elliott wave principle]] and [[Fibonacci retracement]]).  However, other market analysts have published analyses suggesting that these percentages and patterns are not supported by the data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roy Batchelor]] and Richard Ramyar, "[https://www.webcitation.org/5reh6NujR?url=http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/media/stories/resources/Magic_Numbers_in_the_Dow.pdf Magic numbers in the Dow]," 25th International Symposium on Forecasting, 2005, p.  13, 31.

====Pyramids====
[[File:Mathematical Pyramid.svg|right|thumb|250px|A regular square pyramid is determined by its medial right triangle, whose edges are the pyramid's apothem (a), semi-base (b), and height (h); the face inclination angle is also marked. Mathematical proportions b:h:a of &lt;math&gt;1:\sqrt{\varphi}:\varphi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;3:4:5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1:4/\pi:1.61899&lt;/math&gt; are of particular interest in relation to Egyptian pyramids.]]
Both Egyptian pyramids and the regular [[square pyramid]]s that resemble them can be analyzed with respect to the golden ratio and other ratios.

=====Mathematical pyramids and triangles=====
A pyramid in which the apothem (slant height along the bisector of a face) is equal to {{φ}} times the semi-base (half the base width) is sometimes called a ''golden pyramid''. The isosceles triangle that is the face of such a pyramid can be constructed from the two halves of a diagonally split golden rectangle (of size semi-base by apothem), joining the medium-length edges to make the apothem. The height of this pyramid is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; times the semi-base (that is, the slope of the face is &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt;); the square of the height is equal to the area of a face, {{φ}} times the square of the semi-base.

The medial [[right triangle]] of this "golden" pyramid (see diagram), with sides &lt;math&gt;1:\sqrt{\varphi}:\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is interesting in its own right, demonstrating via the [[Pythagorean theorem]] the relationship &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi} = \sqrt{\varphi^2 - 1}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\varphi = \sqrt{1 + \varphi}&lt;/math&gt;. This [[Kepler triangle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Best of Astraea: 17 Articles on Science, History and Philosophy | url = https://books.google.com/?id=LDTPvbXLxgQC&amp;pg=PA93 | publisher = Astrea Web Radio | isbn = 1-4259-7040-0 | year = 2006 | author1 = Radio, Astraea Web }}&lt;/ref&gt;
is the only right triangle proportion with edge lengths in [[geometric progression]],&lt;ref name=herz&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Shape of the Great Pyramid | author = Roger Herz-Fischler | publisher = Wilfrid Laurier University Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-88920-324-5 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=066T3YLuhA0C&amp;pg=PA81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; just as the 3–4–5 triangle is the only right triangle proportion with edge lengths in [[arithmetic progression]]. The angle with tangent &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the angle that the side of the pyramid makes with respect to the ground, 51.827... degrees (51° 49' 38").&lt;ref&gt;Midhat Gazale, ''Gnomon: From Pharaohs to Fractals'', Princeton Univ. Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

A nearly similar pyramid shape, but with rational proportions, is described in the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (the source of a large part of modern knowledge of ancient [[Egyptian mathematics]]), based on the 3:4:5 triangle;&lt;ref name = "maor"/&gt; the face slope corresponding to the angle with tangent 4/3 is 53.13 degrees (53 degrees and 8 minutes).&lt;ref name=Herkommer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petrospec-technologies.com/Herkommer/pyramid/pyramid.htm |title=The Great Pyramid, The Great Discovery, and The Great Coincidence |accessdate=2007-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102194148/http://www.petrospec-technologies.com/Herkommer/pyramid/pyramid.htm |archivedate=2014-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The slant height or apothem is 5/3 or 1.666... times the semi-base. The Rhind papyrus has another pyramid problem as well, again with rational slope (expressed as run over rise). Egyptian mathematics did not include the notion of irrational numbers,&lt;ref&gt;Lancelot Hogben, ''Mathematics for the Million'', London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1942, p.&amp;nbsp;63., as cited by Dick Teresi, ''Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science—from the Babylonians to the Maya'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; and the rational inverse slope (run/rise, multiplied by a factor of 7 to convert to their conventional units of palms per cubit) was used in the building of pyramids.&lt;ref name = "maor"/&gt;

Another mathematical pyramid with proportions almost identical to the "golden" one is the one with perimeter equal to 2{{pi}} times the height, or h:b = 4:{{pi}}. This triangle has a face angle of 51.854° (51°51'), very close to the 51.827° of the Kepler triangle. This pyramid relationship corresponds to the [[mathematical coincidences|coincidental relationship]] &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\varphi} \approx 4/\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

Egyptian pyramids very close in proportion to these mathematical pyramids are known.&lt;ref name=Herkommer/&gt;

=====Egyptian pyramids=====
In the mid-nineteenth century, Röber studied various Egyptian pyramids including Khafre, Menkaure and some of the Giza, Sakkara, and Abusir groups, and was interpreted as saying that half the base of the side of the pyramid is the middle mean of the side, forming what other authors identified as the Kepler triangle; many other mathematical theories of the shape of the pyramids have also been explored.&lt;ref name=herz/&gt;

One Egyptian pyramid is remarkably close to a "golden pyramid"—the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] (also known as the Pyramid of Cheops or Khufu). Its slope of 51° 52' is extremely close to the "golden" pyramid inclination of 51° 50' and the {{pi}}-based pyramid inclination of 51° 51'; other pyramids at Giza (Chephren, 52° 20', and Mycerinus, 50° 47')&lt;ref name="maor"&gt;[[Eli Maor]], ''Trigonometric Delights'', Princeton Univ. Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; are also quite close. Whether the relationship to the golden ratio in these pyramids is by design or by accident remains open to speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Adding fuel to controversy over the architectural authorship of the Great Pyramid, [[Eric Temple Bell]], mathematician and historian, claimed in 1950 that Egyptian mathematics would not have supported the ability to calculate the slant height of the pyramids, or the ratio to the height, except in the case of the 3:4:5 pyramid, since the 3:4:5 triangle was the only right triangle known to the Egyptians and they did not know the Pythagorean theorem, nor any way to reason about irrationals such as {{pi}} or {{φ}}.{{Disputed inline|Egyptian Pyramids|date=November 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bell |first=Eric Temple |title=The Development of Mathematics |location=New York |publisher=Dover |year=1940 |page=40 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_5KAnw3QMC8C&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Rice&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Michael, ''Egypt's Legacy: The Archetypes of Western Civilisation, 3000 to 30 B.C'' pp. 24 Routledge, 2003, {{isbn|0-415-26876-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; asserts that principal authorities on the history of [[Egyptian architecture]] have argued that the Egyptians were well acquainted with the golden ratio and that it is part of mathematics of the Pyramids, citing Giedon (1957).&lt;ref&gt;S. Giedon, 1957, The Beginnings of Architecture, The A.W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts, 457, as cited in Rice, Michael, ''Egypt's Legacy: The Archetypes of Western Civilisation, 3000 to 30 B.C'' pp.24 Routledge, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Historians of science have always debated whether the Egyptians had any such knowledge or not, contending rather that its appearance in an Egyptian building is the result of chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Markowsky | first = George | date = January 1992 | title = Misconceptions about the Golden Ratio | journal = College Mathematics Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | doi = 10.2307/2686193 | url = http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/teaching/maa/markowsky.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = | jstor = 2686193 | publisher = Mathematical Association of America | pages = 2–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, the [[Pyramidology|pyramidologist]] [[John Taylor (1781–1864)|John Taylor]] claimed that, in the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], the golden ratio is represented by the ratio of the length of the face (the slope height), inclined at an angle [[θ]] to the ground, to half the length of the side of the square base, equivalent to the [[Cosecant|secant]] of the angle θ.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, ''The Great Pyramid: Why Was It Built and Who Built It?'', 1859&lt;/ref&gt; The above two lengths were about 186.4 and 115.2 meters respectively. The ratio of these lengths is the golden ratio, accurate to more digits than either of the original measurements. Similarly, [[Richard William Howard Vyse|Howard Vyse]], according to Matila Ghyka,&lt;ref&gt;Matila Ghyka ''The Geometry of Art and Life'', New York: Dover, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; reported the great pyramid height 148.2 m, and half-base 116.4 m, yielding 1.6189 for the ratio of slant height to half-base, again more accurate than the data variability.

==Mathematics==
Usually, the lowercase form of phi (φ or {{math|''φ''}}) is used to symbolize the golden ratio. Sometimes the uppercase form (&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;) is used for the [[Reciprocal (mathematics)|reciprocal]] of the golden ratio, 1/{{math|''φ''}}.&lt;ref name="MathWorld GR Conjugate"/&gt;

Two quantities ''a'' and ''b'' are said to be in the ''golden ratio'' {{math|''φ''}} if

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{a+b}{a} = \frac{a}{b} = \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

One method for finding the value of {{math|''φ''}} is to start with the left fraction. Through simplifying the fraction and substituting in b/a = 1/{{math|''φ''}},

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a+b}{a} = \frac{a}{a}+\frac{b}{a} = 1 + \frac{b}{a} = 1 + \frac{1}{\varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt; 1 + \frac{1}{\varphi} = \varphi. &lt;/math&gt;

Multiplying by {{math|''φ''}} gives

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi + 1 = \varphi^2&lt;/math&gt;

which can be rearranged to

:&lt;math&gt;{\varphi}^2 - \varphi - 1 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[quadratic formula]], two solutions are obtained:
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.61803\,39887\dots&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = -0.6180\,339887\dots&lt;/math&gt;

Because {{math|''φ''}} is the ratio between positive quantities {{math|''φ''}} is necessarily positive:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1.61803\,39887\dots&lt;/math&gt; .

The golden ratio is an [[irrational number]]. Below are two short proofs of irrationality:

====Contradiction from an expression in lowest terms====
[[File:Whirling squares.svg|thumb|right|If &amp;phi; were [[Rational number|rational]], then it would be the ratio of sides of a rectangle with integer sides (the rectangle comprising the entire diagram). But it would also be a ratio of integer sides of the smaller rectangle (the rightmost portion of the diagram) obtained by deleting a square. The sequence of decreasing integer side lengths formed by deleting squares cannot be continued indefinitely because the integers have a lower bound, so &amp;phi; cannot be rational.]]

Recall that:

: the whole is the longer part plus the shorter part;
: the whole is to the longer part as the longer part is to the shorter part.

If we call the whole ''n'' and the longer part ''m'', then the second statement above becomes

: ''n'' is to ''m'' as ''m'' is to ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'',

or, algebraically

: &lt;math&gt; \frac nm = \frac{m}{n-m}.\qquad (*) &lt;/math&gt;

To say that the golden ratio {{math|''φ''}} is rational means that {{math|''φ''}} is a fraction ''n''/''m'' where ''n'' and ''m'' are integers.  We may take ''n''/''m'' to be in [[lowest terms]] and ''n'' and ''m'' to be positive. But if ''n''/''m'' is in lowest terms, then the identity labeled (*) above says ''m''/(''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''m'') is in still lower terms. That is a contradiction that follows from the assumption that {{math|''φ''}} is rational.

====By irrationality of {{radic|5}}====
Another short proof—perhaps more commonly known—of the irrationality of the golden ratio makes use of the [[closure (mathematics)|closure]] of rational numbers under addition and multiplication. If &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is rational, then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle2\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right) - 1= \sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt; is also rational, which is a contradiction if it is already known that the square root of a non-[[square number|square]] [[natural number]] is irrational.

===Minimal polynomial===
The golden ratio is also an [[algebraic number]] and even an [[algebraic integer]]. It has [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]]

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 - x - 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Having degree 2, this polynomial actually has two roots, the other being the golden ratio conjugate.

===Golden ratio conjugate===
The conjugate root to the minimal polynomial x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − x − 1 is

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{1}{\varphi}=1-\varphi = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = -0.61803\,39887\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

The absolute value of this quantity (≈ 0.618) corresponds to the length ratio taken in reverse order (shorter segment length over longer segment length, ''b/a''), and is sometimes referred to as the ''golden ratio conjugate''.&lt;ref name="MathWorld GR Conjugate"&gt;{{MathWorld|title=Golden Ratio Conjugate|urlname=GoldenRatioConjugate}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is denoted here by the capital Phi ('''&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;'''):

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = {1 \over \varphi} = \varphi^{-1} = 0.61803\,39887\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, '''&lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;''' can be expressed as

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi = \varphi -1 = 1.61803\,39887\ldots -1 = 0.61803\,39887\ldots.&lt;/math&gt;

This illustrates the unique property of the golden ratio among positive numbers, that

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \varphi} = \varphi - 1,&lt;/math&gt;

or its inverse:

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \Phi} = \Phi + 1.&lt;/math&gt;

This means 0.61803...:1 = 1:1.61803....

The formula {{math|''φ''}} = 1 + 1/{{math|''φ''}} can be expanded recursively to obtain a [[continued fraction]] for the golden ratio:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Concrete Abstractions: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Scheme

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = [1; 1, 1, 1, \dots] = 1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \ddots}}}&lt;/math&gt;

and its reciprocal:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^{-1} = [0; 1, 1, 1, \dots] = 0 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \ddots}}}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Convergent (continued fraction)|convergent]]s of these continued fractions (1/1, 2/1, 3/2, 5/3, 8/5, 13/8, ..., or 1/1, 1/2, 2/3, 3/5, 5/8, 8/13, ...) are ratios of successive [[Fibonacci numbers]].

The equation {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 + {{math|''φ''}} likewise produces the [[Nested radical|continued square root]], or infinite surd, form:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 + \cdots}}}}.&lt;/math&gt;

An infinite series can be derived to express phi:&lt;ref&gt;Brian Roselle, [http://sites.google.com/site/goldenmeanseries/ "Golden Mean Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi=\frac{13}{8}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{(n+1)}(2n+1)!}{(n+2)!n!4^{(2n+3)}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Also:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = 1+2\sin(\pi/10) = 1 + 2\sin 18^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = {1 \over 2}\csc(\pi/10) = {1 \over 2}\csc 18^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = 2\cos(\pi/5)=2\cos 36^\circ&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \varphi = 2\sin(3\pi/10)=2\sin 54^\circ. &lt;/math&gt;

These correspond to the fact that the length of the diagonal of a regular pentagon is {{math|''φ''}} times the length of its side, and similar relations in a [[pentagram]].

Overlapping portions appear &lt;span style="color:olive;"&gt;yellow&lt;/span&gt;. The length of the side of one square divided by that of the next smaller square is the golden ratio.]]
The number {{math|''φ''}} turns up frequently in [[geometry]], particularly in figures with pentagonal [[symmetry]].
The length of a regular [[pentagon]]'s [[diagonal]] is {{math|''φ''}} times its side.
The vertices of a regular [[icosahedron]] are those of [[3|three]] mutually [[orthogonal]] golden rectangles.

There is no known general [[algorithm]] to arrange a given number of nodes evenly on a sphere, for any of several definitions of even distribution (see, for example, ''[[Thomson problem]]''). However, a useful approximation results from dividing the sphere into parallel bands of equal [[surface area]] and placing one node in each band at longitudes spaced by a golden section of the circle, i.e. 360°/{{math|''φ''}} ≅ 222.5°. This method was used to arrange the 1500 mirrors of the student-participatory [[artificial satellite|satellite]] [[STARSHINE|Starshine-3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast09oct_1/ |title=A Disco Ball in Space |publisher=NASA |date=2001-10-09 |accessdate=2007-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Golden triangle, pentagon and pentagram====
[[File:Golden triangle (math).svg|right|thumb|[[Golden triangle (mathematics)|Golden triangle]]. The double-red-arched angle is 36 degrees, or &lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{5}&lt;/math&gt; radians.]]

=====Golden triangle=====
The [[Golden triangle (mathematics)|golden triangle]] can be characterized as an [[isosceles triangle]] ABC with the property that [[bisection|bisecting]] the angle C produces a new [[triangle]] CXB which is a [[similar triangle]] to the original.

If angle BCX = α, then XCA = α because of the bisection, and CAB = α because of the similar triangles; ABC = 2α from the original isosceles symmetry, and BXC = 2α by similarity. The angles in a triangle add up to 180°, so 5α = 180, giving α = 36°. So the angles of the golden triangle are thus 36°-72°-72°. The angles of the remaining obtuse isosceles triangle AXC (sometimes called the golden gnomon) are 36°-36°-108°.

Suppose XB has length 1, and we call BC length {{math|''φ''}}. Because of the isosceles triangles XC=XA and BC=XC, so these are also length&amp;nbsp;φ. Length AC&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;AB, therefore equals {{math|''φ''}}&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1. But triangle ABC is similar to triangle CXB, so AC/BC&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;BC/BX, AC/{{math|''φ''}}&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;φ/1, and so AC also equals {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus {{math|''φ''}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; =&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, confirming that {{math|''φ''}} is indeed the golden ratio.

Similarly, the ratio of the area of the larger triangle AXC to the smaller CXB is equal to {{math|''φ''}}, while the [[Multiplicative inverse|inverse]] ratio is&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1.

=====Pentagon=====
In a [[pentagon#Regular pentagons|regular pentagon]] the ratio of a diagonal to a side is the golden ratio, while intersecting diagonals section each other in the golden ratio.&lt;ref name = "Pacioli"/&gt;

=====Odom's construction=====
[[File:Odom.svg|thumb|218 px|Let A and B be midpoints of the sides EF and ED of an equilateral triangle DEF. Extend AB to meet the circumcircle of DEF at C.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{|AB|}{|BC|}=\tfrac{|AC|}{|AB|}=\phi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[George Phillips Odom, Jr|George Odom]] has given a remarkably simple construction for {{φ}} involving an equilateral triangle: if an equilateral triangle is inscribed in a circle and the line segment joining the midpoints of two sides is produced to intersect the circle in either of two points, then these three points are in golden proportion. This result is a straightforward consequence of the [[intersecting chords theorem]] and can be used to construct a regular pentagon, a construction that attracted the attention of the noted Canadian geometer [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]] who published it in Odom's name as a diagram in the ''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'' accompanied by the single word "Behold!" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quandaries and Queries|url=http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/qq/database/QQ.09.02/mary1.html|publisher=Math Central|accessdate=23 October 2011|author=Chris and Penny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Pentagram=====
The golden ratio plays an important role in the geometry of [[pentagram]]s. Each intersection of edges sections other edges in the golden ratio. Also, the ratio of the length of the shorter segment to the segment bounded by the two intersecting edges (a side of the pentagon in the pentagram's center) is {{φ}}, as the four-color illustration shows.

The pentagram includes ten [[isosceles triangle]]s: five [[acute triangle|acute]] and five [[obtuse triangle|obtuse]] isosceles triangles. In all of them, the ratio of the longer side to the shorter side is {{φ}}. The acute triangles are golden triangles. The obtuse isosceles triangles are golden gnomons.

=====Ptolemy's theorem=====
[[File:Ptolemy Pentagon.svg|thumb|The golden ratio in a regular pentagon can be computed using [[Ptolemy's theorem]].]]

The golden ratio properties of a regular pentagon can be confirmed by applying [[Ptolemy's theorem]] to the quadrilateral formed by removing one of its vertices. If the quadrilateral's long edge and diagonals are ''b'', and short edges are ''a'', then Ptolemy's theorem gives ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''ab'' which yields

:&lt;math&gt;{b \over a}={{1+\sqrt{5}}\over 2}.&lt;/math&gt;

====Scalenity of triangles====
Consider a [[triangle]] with sides of lengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' in decreasing order. Define the "scalenity" of the triangle to be the smaller of the two ratios ''a''/''b'' and ''b''/''c''. The scalenity is always less than {{φ}} and can be made as close as desired to {{φ}}.&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Mathematical Monthly]]'', pp.&amp;nbsp;49–50, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Triangle whose sides form a geometric progression====
If the side lengths of a triangle form a [[geometric progression]] and are in the ratio 1 : ''r'' : ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''r'' is the common ratio, then ''r'' must lie in the range {{φ}}−1 &lt; ''r'' &lt; {{φ}}, which is a consequence of the [[triangle inequality]] (the sum of any two sides of a triangle must be strictly bigger than the length of the third side). If ''r'' = {{φ}} then the shorter two sides are 1 and {{φ}} but their sum is {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, thus ''r'' &lt; {{φ}}. A similar calculation shows that ''r'' &gt; {{φ}}−1. A triangle whose sides are in the ratio 1 : {{radic|{{φ}}}} : {{φ}} is a right triangle (because 1 + {{φ}} = {{φ}}&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) known as a [[Kepler triangle]].&lt;ref name=herz/&gt;

====Golden triangle, rhombus, and rhombic triacontahedron====
[[File:GoldenRhombus.svg|thumb|One of the rhombic triacontahedron's rhombi]]

[[File:Rhombictriacontahedron.svg|thumb|All of the faces of the rhombic triacontahedron are golden rhombi]]

A [[golden rhombus]] is a [[rhombus]] whose diagonals are in the golden ratio. The [[rhombic triacontahedron]] is a [[convex polytope]] that has a very special property: all of its faces are golden rhombi.  In the [[rhombic triacontahedron]] the [[dihedral angle]] between any two adjacent rhombi is 144°, which is twice the isosceles angle of a golden triangle and four times its most acute angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Catalan solids derived from three-dimensional-root systems and quaternions|first1=Mehmet|last1=Koca|first2=Nazife Ozdes|last2=Koca|first3=Ramazan|last3=Koç|journal=	Journal of Mathematical Physics|volume=51|year=2010|page=043501|doi=10.1063/1.3356985|arxiv=0908.3272|bibcode=2010JMP....51d3501K}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to Fibonacci sequence===
The mathematics of the golden ratio and of the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]] are intimately interconnected. The Fibonacci sequence is:

:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, ...

A [[closed-form expression]] for the Fibonacci sequence involves the golden ratio:

:&lt;math&gt;F\left(n\right)
 = {{\varphi^n-(1-\varphi)^n} \over {\sqrt 5}}
 = {{\varphi^n-(-\varphi)^{-n}} \over {\sqrt 5}}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Golden Square fractal with T-branching 8.svg|thumb|Golden squares with [[T-square (fractal)|T-branching]]]]
[[File:Golden Square fractal 6.svg|thumb|Golden square fractal]]

The golden ratio is the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the ratios of successive terms of the Fibonacci sequence (or any Fibonacci-like sequence), as originally shown by [[Kepler]]:&lt;ref name="tatt"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}=\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, if a Fibonacci number is divided by its immediate predecessor in the sequence, the quotient approximates {{φ}}; e.g., 987/610&amp;nbsp;{{math|≈}}&amp;nbsp;1.6180327868852. These approximations are alternately lower and higher than {{φ}}, and converge to {{φ}} as the Fibonacci numbers increase, and:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}|F_n\varphi-F_{n+1}|

= \varphi.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{F_{n+a}}{F_n} = \varphi^a,&lt;/math&gt;

where above, the ratios of consecutive terms of the Fibonacci sequence, is a case when &lt;math&gt;a = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, the successive powers of {{φ}} obey the Fibonacci [[recurrence relation|recurrence]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^{n+1} = \varphi^n + \varphi^{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This identity allows any polynomial in {{φ}} to be reduced to a linear expression. For example:
: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
3\varphi^3 - 5\varphi^2 + 4 &amp; = 3(\varphi^2 + \varphi) - 5\varphi^2 + 4 \\
&amp; = 3[(\varphi + 1) + \varphi] - 5(\varphi + 1) + 4 \\
&amp; = \varphi + 2 \approx 3.618.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The reduction to a linear expression can be accomplished in one step by using the relationship
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^k=F_k \varphi +F_{k-1},&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;F_k&lt;/math&gt; is the ''k''th Fibonacci number.

However, this is no special property of {{φ}}, because polynomials in any solution ''x'' to a [[quadratic equation]] can be reduced in an analogous manner, by applying:
:&lt;math&gt;x^2=ax+b&lt;/math&gt;
for given coefficients ''a'', ''b'' such that ''x'' satisfies the equation. Even more generally, any [[rational function]] (with rational coefficients) of the root of an irreducible ''n''th-degree polynomial over the rationals can be reduced to a polynomial of degree {{nowrap|''n'' ‒ 1.}}  Phrased in terms of [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]], if α is a root of an irreducible ''n''th-degree polynomial, then &lt;math&gt;\Q(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; has degree ''n'' over &lt;math&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt;, with basis &lt;math&gt;\{1, \alpha, \dots, \alpha^{n-1}\}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Symmetries===
The golden ratio and inverse golden ratio &lt;math&gt;\varphi_\pm = (1\pm \sqrt{5})/2&lt;/math&gt; have a set of symmetries that preserve and interrelate them. They are both preserved by the [[fractional linear transformation]]s &lt;math&gt;x, 1/(1-x), (x-1)/x,&lt;/math&gt; – this fact corresponds to the identity and the definition quadratic equation.
Further, they are interchanged by the three maps &lt;math&gt;1/x, 1-x, x/(x-1)&lt;/math&gt; – they are reciprocals, symmetric about &lt;math&gt;1/2&lt;/math&gt;, and (projectively) symmetric about 2.

More deeply, these maps form a subgroup of the [[modular group]] &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{PSL}(2,\mathbf{Z})&lt;/math&gt; isomorphic to the [[symmetric group]] on 3 letters, &lt;math&gt;S_3,&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the [[stabilizer subgroup|stabilizer]] of the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1,\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; of 3 standard points on the [[projective line]], and the symmetries correspond to the quotient map &lt;math&gt;S_3 \to S_2&lt;/math&gt; – the subgroup &lt;math&gt;C_3 &lt; S_3&lt;/math&gt; consisting of the 3-cycles and the identity &lt;math&gt;() (0 1 \infty) (0 \infty 1)&lt;/math&gt; fixes the two numbers, while the 2-cycles interchange these, thus realizing the map.

===Other properties===
The golden ratio has the simplest expression (and slowest convergence) as a continued fraction expansion of any irrational number (see ''Alternate forms'' above). It is, for that reason, one of the [[continued fraction#A property of the golden ratio φ|worst cases]] of [[Lagrange's approximation theorem]] and it is an extremal case of the [[Hurwitz's theorem (number theory)|Hurwitz inequality]] for [[Diophantine approximation]]s. This may be why angles close to the golden ratio often show up in [[phyllotaxis]] (the growth of plants).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibnat2.html Fibonacci Numbers and Nature – Part 2 : Why is the Golden section the "best" arrangement?], from [http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/ Dr. Ron Knott's] [http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/ Fibonacci Numbers and the Golden Section], retrieved 2012-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The defining quadratic polynomial and the conjugate relationship lead to decimal values that have their fractional part in common with {{φ}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi^2 = \varphi + 1 = 2.618\dots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \varphi} = \varphi - 1 = 0.618\dots.&lt;/math&gt;

The sequence of powers of {{φ}} contains these values 0.618..., 1.0, 1.618..., 2.618...; more generally,
any power of {{φ}} is equal to the sum of the two immediately preceding powers:

: &lt;math&gt;\varphi^n = \varphi^{n-1} + \varphi^{n-2} = \varphi \cdot \operatorname{F}_n + \operatorname{F}_{n-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

As a result, one can easily decompose any power of {{φ}} into a multiple of {{φ}} and a constant. The multiple and the constant are always adjacent Fibonacci numbers. This leads to another property of the positive powers of {{φ}}:

If &lt;math&gt; \lfloor n/2 - 1 \rfloor = m &lt;/math&gt;, then:

:&lt;math&gt; \!\ \varphi^n = \varphi^{n-1} + \varphi^{n-3} + \cdots + \varphi^{n-1-2m} + \varphi^{n-2-2m} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \!\ \varphi^n - \varphi^{n-1} = \varphi^{n-2} . &lt;/math&gt;

When the golden ratio is used as the base of a [[numeral system]] (see [[Golden ratio base]], sometimes dubbed ''phinary'' or {{φ}}''-nary''), every integer has a terminating representation, despite {{φ}} being irrational, but every fraction has a non-terminating representation.

The golden ratio is a [[Fundamental unit (number theory)|fundamental unit]] of the [[algebraic number field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})&lt;/math&gt; and is a [[Pisot–Vijayaraghavan number]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|urlname=PisotNumber |title=Pisot Number}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5})&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\varphi^n = {{L_n + F_n \sqrt{5}} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;L_n&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-th [[Lucas number]].

The golden ratio also appears in [[hyperbolic geometry]], as the maximum distance from a point on one side of an [[ideal triangle]] to the closer of the other two sides: this distance, the side length of the [[equilateral triangle]] formed by the points of tangency of a circle inscribed within the ideal triangle, is &lt;math&gt;4\log(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabri.net/abracadabri/GeoNonE/GeoHyper/KBModele/Biss3KB.html Horocycles exinscrits : une propriété hyperbolique remarquable], cabri.net, retrieved 2009-07-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decimal expansion===
The golden ratio's decimal expansion can be calculated directly from the expression
:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = {1+\sqrt{5} \over 2}&lt;/math&gt;

with {{radic|5}} ≈ 2.2360679774997896964 {{OEIS2C|id=A002163}}. The [[square root of 5]] can be calculated with the [[Babylonian method]], starting with an initial estimate such as ''x''{{φ}} = 2 and [[iterative method|iterating]]

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{(x_n + 5/x_n)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, ..., until the difference between ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt; becomes zero, to the desired number of digits.

The Babylonian algorithm for {{radic|5}} is equivalent to [[Newton's method]] for solving the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;5 = 0. In its more general form, Newton's method can be applied directly to any [[algebraic equation]], including the equation ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;x&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 = 0 that defines the golden ratio. This gives an iteration that converges to the golden ratio itself,

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2 + 1}{2x_n - 1},&lt;/math&gt;

for an appropriate initial estimate ''x''{{φ}} such as ''x''{{φ}} = 1. A slightly faster method is to rewrite the equation as ''x''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1/''x'' = 0, in which case the Newton iteration becomes

:&lt;math&gt;x_{n+1} = \frac{x_n^2 + 2x_n}{x_n^2 + 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

These iterations all [[quadratic convergence|converge quadratically]]; that is, each step roughly doubles the number of correct digits. The golden ratio is therefore relatively easy to compute with [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic|arbitrary precision]]. The time needed to compute ''n'' digits of the golden ratio is proportional to the time needed to divide two ''n''-digit numbers. This is considerably faster than known algorithms for the [[transcendental number]]s '''[[pi|{{pi}}]]''' and [[e (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|'''e'''}}]].

An easily programmed alternative using only integer arithmetic is to calculate two large consecutive Fibonacci numbers and divide them. The ratio of Fibonacci numbers ''F'' &lt;sub&gt;25001&lt;/sub&gt; and ''F'' &lt;sub&gt;25000&lt;/sub&gt;, each over 5000 digits, yields over 10,000 significant digits of the golden ratio.

The decimal expansion of the golden ratio {{φ}}&lt;ref name="a001622"/&gt; has been calculated to an accuracy of two trillion ({{val|2|e=12}} = 2,000,000,000,000) digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.numberworld.org/digits/GoldenRatio/ |title=Golden Ratio |first= Alexander J. |last=Yee |date=17 August 2015 |website=numberword.org}}  Independent computations done by Ron Watkins and Dustin Kirkland.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomasson''' or '''Hyperart Thomasson''' (Japanese: ''Tomason'' トマソン or ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason'' 超芸術トマソン) is a type of [[conceptual art]] named by the Japanese artist [[Akasegawa Genpei]] in the 1980s. It refers to a useless relic or structure that has been preserved as part of a building or the built environment, which has become a piece of art in itself. These objects, although having the appearance of pieces of conceptual art, were not created to be viewed as such. Akasegawa deemed them even more art-like than art itself, and named them "hyperart." In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in Thomasson, especially since the publication of Akasegawa's work on the subject in English in 2010.&lt;ref name=fargo&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, [http://kaya.com/books/hyperart-thomasson/ ''Hyperart: Thomasson,''] translated by Matt Fargo, Kaya Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Origin of the term==

The term Thomasson comes from the professional baseball player [[Gary Thomasson]], who was signed by the [[Yomiuri Giants]] for a record-breaking sum of money, and spent his final two seasons with the team (1981–1982) coming close to setting the league strikeout record before being benched.&lt;ref name=Prakash&gt;Prakash, Gyan and Kevin Michael Kruse, [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=rDGd7HDMFp4C&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;dq=tomason%20art&amp;pg=PA397#v=onepage&amp;q=tomason%20art&amp;f=false ''The Spaces of the Modern City: Imaginaries, Politics, and Everyday Life''], 2008 p. 397 n25&lt;/ref&gt; Akasegawa viewed Thomasson's useless position on the team as a fitting analogy for "an object, part of a building, that was maintained in good condition, but with no purpose, to the point of becoming a work of art." &lt;ref name="Akasegawa"&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480021892/ ''Chōgeijutsu tomason,''] Chikuma Shobō, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japanese there is no differentiation between singular and plural versions of the noun ''Tomason'', therefore in English too, Thomasson can refer to one or many of these objects. In English, the term is sometimes spelled '''Tomason''', or '''Thomason'''.

==History==

Akasegawa discovered the first Thomasson in 1972, in [[Yotsuya]], [[Tokyo]] when he noticed a staircase that had no entranceway when one reached the top. The handlerail of the staircase, however, showed signs of repair, suggesting it was still being maintained despite the apparent uselessness of the staircase itself. The following year, Akasegawa discovered a boarded up ticket window at Ekoda station on the [[Seibu Ikebukuro Line]]. The plywood used to board up the window had been cut neatly to fit the curved stone tray of the ticket window, where it had been worn through years of use. Minami Shindō, a fellow artist and friend of Akasegawa also found a gateway at a hospital in [[Ochanomizu]] that had been completely filled up with concrete, whilst the gateway itself was still in good condition.

The artists gave these objects names such as "The pure staircase of Yotsuya," "The useless window of Ekoda" and "The useless gate of Ochanomizu" and referred to them collectively as "hyperart": their similar characteristics being "an object which, just like a piece of art, has no purpose in society, but also, just like a piece of art is preserved with care, to the point where it appears to be on display. However, these objects do not appear to have a creator, making them even more art-like than regular art."&lt;ref name="Akasegawa"/&gt; Hyperart cannot be created by an artist, but only found and recognized as such by an observer.

Those pieces of hyperart that were part of buildings or the built environment were given the name "Thomasson." The name was decided upon during a discussion between Akasegawa and his students during his class on "Modernology" (a concept created by [[Wajiro Kon]]). At that time, Gary Thomasson's strikeout record was at 132.

The concept of Thomasson was introduced to the general public in 1982, via a series of articles in the magazine ''Shashin Jidai'' (Photo Times), published by Byakuya-Shobō. The articles featured findings by Akasegawa's students from his "Modernology" class as well as photographs of those "objects" catalogued by Akasegawa himself, and those sent in by readers. The articles created a "Thomasson Boom" and the concept soon spread. The early Thomasson articles featured in ''Shashin Jidai'' were published by Byakuya-Shobō as a book entitled ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason''.&lt;ref name=byakuya&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, ''Chogeijutsu Tomason,'' Byakuya Shobō, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; The complete series of articles was later published as a paperback by [[Chikuma Shobō]] in 1987, using the same title.

==Influence==

The Thomasson boom after the publication of articles in ''Shashin Jidai'' had a big effect on students and young people interested in arts and the avant-garde. The word Thomasson even spread to people who did not understand what it referred to, in a kind of social phenomenon. The cover of ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason'' featured a lost neighborhood of Minato-ku in Tokyo, Tani-cho, which vanished due to land redevelopment. Whilst not directly related to Thomasson, the story of Tani embodied its spirit. Its use on the cover of the book had a large effect on the "Thomasson Boom." This case also showed the effects of the bubble economy on the city landscape.&lt;ref name=tanaka&gt;Jun Tanaka [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09555803.2011.599125 "Decaying ‘swamp city’: the death of Shōwa and Tokyo"], Japan Forum, 23:2, 2011, 273-285&lt;/ref&gt; As historian Jordan Sand notes, cataloguing Thomasson was "a way of regaining some sense of the human imprint on the city in an era when that imprint was being rapidly erased."&lt;ref name=fargo/&gt;

In 1983 the Thomasson Observation Center held an exhibition entitled "Cityscape in Anguish" at Gallery 612 in [[Shinjuku]], displaying Akasegawa's paintings and photographs of Thomasson by Akasegawa, his students, and those sent in by readers of the magazine.  Various tie-in events such as Thomasson bus tours, lectures by Akasegawa, as well as coverage on the Japanese national broadcaster [[NHK]], and the publication, in 1987 of the complete "Chōgeijutsu Tomason," were the peak of the Thomasson Boom.

Around the same time, other artists and intellectuals were pursuing similar projects. [[Terunobu Fujimori]]'s work on Architecture Detectives, Hayashi Jōji's work cataloguing manhole covers, Minami Shinbo's collections of paper stickers, Ichigi Tsutomu's work on architectural fragments and other such collections, led to Chikuma Shobō publishing a book entitled ''Rojō kansatsugaku nyūmon,'' or "Manual on Street Observation" in 1986.&lt;ref name="Street Observation"&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, Minami Shinbō, Fujimori Terunobu (Editors) [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480028181/ ''Rojō kansatsugaku nyūmon,''] Chikuma Shobō, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;  Alongside this, a Street Observation Society event was held to promote their work, along with a press conference.&lt;ref name=Daniell&gt;Daniell, Thomas “Just Looking: The Origins of the Street Observation Society”. [http://aabookshop.net/?wpsc-product=aa-files-64 ''AA Files'', no. 64], Architectural Association School of Architecture, 2012: 59–68&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Street Observation did appear to be something of a boom, it was not the same type of movement that had surrounded the activities of Akasegawa, his students, and their magazine articles.  After the arrival of the Street Observation Society, Thomasson disappeared from the public eye for a while, due in part to the fact that the Thomasson Observation Center, run by Akasegawa and his students, overwhelmed by press and public attention, stopped its activities soon after the boom reached its peak.

In the years immediately after the Thomasson boom, the concept was referenced in cinema and literature. In the film [[Patlabor: The Movie]] (1989) a scene featured the "Atom-bomb type" Thomasson. [[William Gibson]]'s 1993 SF novel [[Virtual Light]] also makes multiple references to Thomasson.&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;William Gibson, [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=HHYUGVbVUZYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=tomason%20%2B%20akasegawa&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Virtual Light,''] Bantam, 1993 pp. 70, 72, 136, 352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apache&gt;Takayuki Tatsumi, [https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=0Dcxkm5u05YC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Full%20Metal%20Apache%3A%20Transactions%20Between%20Cyberpunk%20Japan%20and%20Avant-Pop%20America&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=thomasson&amp;f=false ''Full Metal Apache: Transactions Between Cyberpunk Japan and Avant-Pop America,''] Duke University Press, 2006, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==

In 2010 the Chikuma Shobō edition of ''Chōgeijutsu Tomason'' was translated into English by Matt Fargo and published as ''Hyperart:Thomasson.''&lt;ref name=fargo/&gt;  In 2012, the Thomasson Observation Center created a Facebook page, and started accepting posts on Thomasson via the internet. The posts were shared widely, and a special form was made available for download to fill out with details of newly discovered Thomasson. A new, internet-era Thomasson movement began. The book and concept have been covered by several English-language media outlets.&lt;ref name=citylab&gt;Citylab [http://www.citylab.com/design/2012/05/useless-and-defunct-city-objects-are-named-thomassons/2075/ Useless and Defunct City Objects Should Be Called... 'Thomassons'], August 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=percent&gt;99% Invisible, [http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/thomassons/ Episode 129, ''Thomassons,''] August 26, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neojaponisme&gt;[http://neojaponisme.com/2008/01/28/roadside-observation/ Darryl Jingwen Wee, "Roadside Observation" ''Neojaponisme'' January 28th, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Thomasson Observation Center held a Grand Thomasson Exhibition at a gallery in [[Shinjuku]], [[Tokyo]] to celebrate the 31st anniversary of its founding.&lt;ref name=thomassonten&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/events/528018727281950/ Grand Thomasson Exhibition]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian of modern Japan Jordan Sand's 2013 work, ''Tokyo Vernacular: Common Spaces, Local Histories, Found Objects,'' also discusses the Thomasson phenomenon in its third chapter, entitled "Deviant Properties: Street Observation Studies." &lt;ref name=sand&gt;Jordan Sand, [https://books.google.co.jp/books/about/Tokyo_Vernacular.html?id=CZqygyfqnpkC&amp;redir_esc=y ''Tokyo Vernacular: Common Spaces, Local Histories, Found Objects,''] University of California Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Sand also contributed an essay to the 2010 translation of ''Hyperart: Thomasson''.

In 2013 “La Poussière de soleils,” an exhibition in [[Brooklyn]] gallery Real Fine Arts, featured Thomasson in the form of a photocopy of Akasegawa's photograph of a door handle sticking out of a cement wall.&lt;ref name=artforum&gt;Lauren O'Neill-Butler, [https://artforum.com/inprint/issue=201309&amp;id=43560 "La Poussière de soleils,"] Artforum international 52.3, Nov 2013, p.290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Thomasson==
Based on the categories in Chikuma Shobō's "Thomasson Illustrated Encyclopedia" (''Tomason Daizukan'' トマソン大図鑑)&lt;ref name=Daizukan&gt;Akasegawa Genpei, [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480032010/ ''Tomason daizukan: mu no maki,''] Chikuma Shobō, 1996; Akasegawa Genpei [https://www.chikumashobo.co.jp/product/9784480032027/ ''Tomason daizukan: kū no maki,']' Chikuma Shobō, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Useless Staircase===
(Japanese: ''Muyō kaidan'' 無用階段)

Also known as a Pure Staircase. A staircase that only goes up and down. Most used to have a door at the top. Some useless staircases exist that were useless right from completion, due to changes or mix-ups in the design.

===The Useless Doorway===
[[File:非常ドア (8401452825).jpg|thumb|Example of a Useless Doorway]]
(Japanese: ''Muyō mon'' 無用門)

Even though it has been blocked up, a Useless Doorway still maintains the majesty of its original purpose. In other cases, a Useless Doorway exists in a place that has no need for it, with no wall or fence around it.

===The Hisashi===
(Japanese: ''Hisashi'' ヒサシ)

Hisashi is the word for "eaves" in Japanese. This refers to useless eaves: ones that no longer have a window or door underneath them to protect from the rain.

===The Useless Window===
(Japanese: ''Muyō mado'', 無用窓)

A blocked up window: one which is still beautiful due to the care taken in blocking it up.

===The Nurikabe===
(Japanese: ''Nurikabe'' ヌリカベ)

Nurikabe is the word for "plaster wall" in Japanese. This overlaps with the Useless Doorway and Useless Window categories. It refers to a door or window that was meant to be completely sealed up with concrete, but a difference can still be seen between it and the surrounding area.

===The A-bomb type===
[[File:Genbaku Type Thomasson in Suruga Word.JPG|thumb|Example of an A-bomb Type Thomasson]]
(Japanese: ''Genbaku taipu'' 原爆タイプ)

A 2-D Thomasson. The outline of a building that remains in silhouette on a wall. This can be seen when a section of a tightly packed row of buildings is torn down. Cases that appear due to water are known as '''Hydrogen bombs''' (''Suibaku'' 水爆). Cases that appear when a hoarding or sign is torn down are known as '''Neutron bombs''' (''Chūseishibakudan'' 中性子爆弾).

===The Elevated type===
(Japanese: ''Kōsho'' 高所)

These objects are normal themselves, but exist in a higher than normal place, therefore seeming strange. For example, a door with a handle on the second floor of a wall. These often appear when staircases are torn down. They can also appear when a winch or crane is kept inside the building, but a standard door is used on the outside.

===The Outie===
(Japanese: ''Debeso'' でべそ)

A protrudence from a sealed up wall, such as a door knob or tap.

===The Uyama===
(Japanese: ''Uyama'' ウヤマ)

A sign or hoarding with letters missing. The first example of this was a shop sign which contained the words Uyama, but the rest of the lettering was missing, hence the name.

===The Castella===
(Japanese: ''Kasutera'' カステラ)

A cuboid protuberance from a wall, named after [[Castella]], a Japanese sponge cake. For example, a blocked up window which sticks out from the wall. The opposite of this, a sunken blocked up section, is known as a '''Reverse Castella'''.

===The Atago===
(Japanese: ''Atago'' アタゴ)

An object sticking out at the side of the road, with no clear purpose, possibly used to stop cars parking. The first example of this was found by Akasegawa whilst walking from [[Shinbashi]] to [[Atago, Minato, Tokyo|Atago]], hence the name.

===The Live Burial===
(Japanese: ''Ikiume'' 生き埋め)

A roadside object which is partly submerged in concrete.

===The Geological layer===
(Japanese: ''Chisō'' 地層)

A patch of ground that is different in height from that around it, usually where multiple construction works have taken place.

===The Boundary===
(Japanese: ''Kyōkai'' 境界)

A guardrail, fence or wall whose purpose is not immediately clear.

===The Twist===
(Japanese: ''Nejire'' ねじれ)

A part of a building which is normally meant to be straight, but is slightly twisted. Often seen when an object that was created to be used straight is used at an angle.

===The Abe Sada===
(Japanese: ''Abe Sada'' 阿部定)

The remains of a telephone pole cut down. The name refers to the [[Abe Sada]] Incident; a famous case from 1930s Japan in which a woman strangled her lover and then severed his genitalia with a kitchen knife.

===The Devouring Tree===
(Japanese: ''Monokūki'' もの喰う木)

A tree which absorbs part of a fence or wire whilst still growing. However, this is not a particularly rare phenomenon, and occurs quite often. If there is no human involvement then it cannot be called a Thomasson, just a natural phenomenon. This is also known as the '''Stubborn Nature Type''' (''shizen kohashi taipu'' 自然強しタイプ).

===The Useless Bridge===
[[File:Nikaryo Futago 06c2902qs.jpg|thumb|Example of a Useless Bridge]]
(Japanese: ''Muyō bashi'' 無用橋)

A bridge over a filled-in river, or a bridge that has become useless. In the case of some covered drains, a bridge is still necessary for cars or heavy vehicles to cross. In this case these could not be called Useless Bridges, as they only appear useless.

===The Pure type===
[[File:Tomason tunnel KaifuStation.JPG|thumb|Example of a Pure Tunnel]]
(Japanese: ''Junsui taipu'' 純粋タイプ)

An uncategorizable object whose use it is impossible to fathom. For example, the Pure Shutters, which open to reveal a blank wall, and the Pure Tunnel that exists without a surrounding hill. The Pure Staircase of Yotsuya belongs in this category.

===Evaporation===
(Japanese: ''Jōhatsu'' 蒸発)

The fading of color on a sign, or a monument with parts missing: an object whose meaning has become hard to work out. Cases often appear due to the long-lasting material of the object. This also often occurs when a sign's key phrases, painted in red for emphasis, disappear, leaving the rest of the sign hard to understand.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5686">'''Jacaranda Music''' is a non-profit organization founded by impresario Patrick Scott and conductor/organist Mark Alan Hilt. Jacaranda produces an annual classical music concert series, mostly of modern music and works written since 2000 as well as rare older classical music with potential interest for contemporary listeners. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jacarandamusic.org/program-history/ |title=Program History|publisher=Jacaranda |access-date=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jacaranda has been based in [[Santa Monica]], California since 2003. In 2016, the series was named by ''[[L.A. Weekly]]'' as the Best Contemporary Classical Series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Payne |first1=John |title=Best Contemporary Classical Series |url=https://www.laweekly.com/best-of/2016/music-and-nightlife/best-rapper-7407206 |website=Best of L.A. |publisher=L.A. Weekly |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Throughout its 16 seasons, Jacaranda has presented the compositions of [[Philip Glass]], [[John Cage]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Lou Harrison]], [[Dylan Mattingly]], [[Mark Grey]], [[Florence Price]], [[Lukas Foss]], [[Julius Eastman]], [[Frederic Rzewski]], [[David Lang (composer)|David Lang]], [[Peter Maxwell Davies]], [[Horatiu Radulescu]], [[Franz Liszt]] and [[George Enescu]], among many others. Musicians have included [[Grammy]] and [[Emmy]] winner [[Gloria Cheng]], [[Anonymous 4]], Quatuor Diotima, Scott Dunn, [[Kathleen Supové]], [[Christopher Taylor (pianist)|Christopher Taylor]], and [[Billy Childs]].
Jacaranda's concerts have been reviewed by several publications, including the [[LA Times]], [[Classical Voice North America]], and [[BBC Music Magazine]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jacarandamusic.org/news/ |title=News|publisher=Jacaranda |access-date=September 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, The ''San Francisco Classical Voice'' said of Jacaranda: "To actually curate a concert is an art. It is one of the qualities that sets apart the Los Angeles music series Jacaranda. For more than 10 years… Jacaranda's concerts have been conceived as musical journeys of discovery…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Farber |first1=Jim |title=A Flock of Oiseaux exotiques Reveals Jacaranda's Charms |url=https://www.sfcv.org/reviews/jacaranda/a-flock-of-oiseaux-exotiques-reveals-jacarandas-charms |website=San Francisco Classical Voice |publisher=San Francisco Classical Voice |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[LA Times]]'' has said of Jacaranda that it "is known for imaginative programs of challenging contemporary music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schultz |first1=Rick |title=15 ways to hear chamber music magic in L.A. this spring |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-spring-preview-chamber-20180325-htmlstory.html |website=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Los Angeles Times'' music critic Mark Swed said of Jacaranda in 2013, "With demanding pieces by [[Péter Eötvös|Eötvös]] and the famed late Hungarian composer [[György Ligeti]], "Fierce Beauty" was the most ambitious undertaking so far and by far for Jacaranda.…With this concert, Jacaranda grew up, moving beyond local to national significance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Swed |first1=Mark |title=Review: Jacaranda gives an important concert featuring Peter Eotvos |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/14/entertainment/la-et-cm-jacaranda-etvs-review-20130114 |website=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former dean of American music critics [[Alan Rich]] regularly wrote about Jacaranda, saying that they produce, "a kind of personalized programming so that you leave each event with the sense of having visited some very smart programming."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rich |first1=Alan |title=DUTCH TREAT: SPHERES AND COOKIES |url=http://www.soiveheard.com/ |website=So I've Heard |publisher=Alan Rich |accessdate=27 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2011, the Lyris Quartet has been its resident ensemble.

[[File:Wamps-Harvest.jpg|thumb|200px|Harvesting the [[Manna]]]]

'''Bernard-Joseph Wamps''' (30 November 1689, [[Lille]] - 9 August 1744, Lille) was a French painter; mostly of religious subjects.

== Biography ==
His father was listed in the "Registre aux Bourgeois" and he received his first lessons in his hometown from [[Arnould de Vuez]].&lt;ref name="G"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=V6IZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA693&amp;dq=Bernard-Joseph+Wamps&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAWoVChMIyJTYnIDcxwIVApqICh1kawpI#v=onepage&amp;q=Bernard-Joseph%20Wamps&amp;f=false Biographical notes] from the ''Dictionary of Painters and Engravers: Biographical and Critical, Volume 2'' @ Google books.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he studied [[porcelain painting]] at the local manufactory and went to Paris, where he worked in the studios of [[Pierre-Jacques Cazes]]. Around 1706, he painted his first major work: "Saint John Preaching in the Wilderness", commissioned by the Lancry family. 

In 1715, he was awarded the [[Prix de Rome]] of the [[Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture]] with his rendering of [[Judith beheading Holofernes]],&lt;ref name="G" /&gt; and received a pension to study at the [[French Academy in Rome]], where he spent five years.

After returning in 1720, he received numerous commissions from religious institutions and created decorations for the Governor's residence. He worked throughout the area, painting murals and other works at churches and convents in [[Douai]], [[Cambrai]], [[Arras]], [[Tournai]], [[Ghent]] and [[Valenciennes]]. Eventually, he acquired enough money to purchase the home of his former teacher, Vuez.

In, the loom-worker Guillaume Werniers produced a series of tapestries on the life of Christ, after drawings by Wamps. These were installed in the choir room of the "Église Saint-Sauveur". Most were later moved to museums, but one went to the "Église Saint Pierre d'Antioche" in [[Villeneuve-d'Ascq]].

His paintings for [[Anchin Abbey]] were destroyed during World War II and are now preserved only as sketches. Other major works include "The Dream of Saint Joseph" and "The Resurrection of Christ" at the [[Hospice Comtesse]] and "The Judgment of David" at the [[Palais des beaux-arts de Lille]].

Sculpture could be found at the [[1893 World's Columbian Exposition]] in various different places and serving a diverse number of functions.  The works displayed in the specially designed sculpture exhibition halls tended to be by the better known artists of the day but the visitors to the Expo did not need to enter the buildings to find sculpture.   The grounds, especially around the lagoon areas and decorating the various bridges were liberally sprinkled with sculpture, most of it made out of [[staff (building material)|staff]], an impermanent material. Also to be found were a number of fountains. Another form of sculpture at the Fair, also made of staff, was the [[architectural sculpture]] that adorned a large number of the buildings.

==Architectural sculpture==
&lt;blockquote&gt;But here it might be well to say something of the material of which they are constructed, the new and wonderful "staff." It has the properties of both common plaster and cement, and can be worked into any required design; in hardening it shows an ivory-like surface, which, however, can be colored in any desired tint. Thus the most ornate architectural effects are produced, and all the buildings, being covered with this decorative substance, present the appearance of veritable palaces. For the designs, etc., it is modeled into plates the required size and joined invisibly, and it is estimated that about 500,000 of these pieces have been used in the large buildings alone.&lt;ref name="Truman"&gt;Benjamin C. Truman, ''History of the World's Fair, Being a Complete Description of the World's Columbian Exposition from Its Inception'' (Chicago &amp; Philadelphia: Mammoth Publishing Company, 1893).[https://books.google.com/books?id=y8jPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA451&amp;lpg=PA451&amp;dq=M.+A.+Waagen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hC6iNeI217&amp;sig=JeqaIhmhR9G4pQ-kB6wEvkHdPo4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQ77aMx6PcAhWHnOAKHVrFAF4Q6AEIdDAR#v=onepage&amp;q=M.%20A.%20Waagen&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|452–53}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sixteen bridges spanned the lagoons that meandered through the fairgrounds. Four statues of native American mammals, also made of staff, decorated the piers at each end of a bridge.&lt;ref name="Truman"/&gt;{{rp|453}}

==Reception==
The film has received positive reception from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 100% of 20 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.7 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Maidan (2014)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/maidan/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean]] rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, the film holds an average score of 86, based on 9 reviews, indicating a 'Universal acclaim' response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/maidan |title=Maidan (2014): Reviews |work=Metacritic |publisher=CNET Networks |accessdate=2014-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leslie Felperin of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a positive review and said that "[t]his stunning, epic-scaled film harkens back to the heroic, journalistic roots of documentary-making and yet feels ineffably modern and formally daring."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/maidan-cannes-review-706197|title='Maidan': Cannes Review|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Jay Weissberg wrote that "In contrast with most documentaries made in the wake of an historic event, "Maidan" will last beyond the current Ukrainian upheaval to stand as compelling witness and a model response to a seminal moment too fresh to be fully processed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/cannes-film-review-maidan-1201192882/|title=Film Review: 'Maidan'|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee Marshal, reviewing the film for [[Screen International]],  said that "[e]ven in the midst of the molotovs, Loznitsa's sincere and memorable document retains its fascination with those small details that make us human, and make democracy worth fighting for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/maidan/5072357.article|title=Maidan|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Atkinson of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' called it "Easily the most rigorous, vital, and powerful movie of 2014, Sergei Loznitsa's ''Maidan'' may be a perfect [[André Bazin|Bazinian]] cinema-machine - reality is captured, crystallized, honored for its organic complexity, and delivered unpoisoned by exposition or emphasis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2014-12-10/film/maidan/|title=Maidan Reveals a Ukrainian Uprising -- and the Crackdown|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Pulver, in a review for ''[[The Guardian]]'', stated: "[i]n some ways it's perfect, in its Eisenstein-esque refusal to compromise on the idea of the crowd as the key participant. In other ways, though, its sternness hampers it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/21/cannes-2014-maidan-film-review-ukraine1|title=Cannes 2014: Maidan review – an unblinking look at Ukraine's history in action|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard Feinstein of ''[[Filmmaker (magazine)|Filmmaker Magazine]]'' wrote that "''Maidan'' is gorgeous if stark. It never crosses the line into aestheticizing the revolution, the suffering and brutality that come along with it. Its artfulness stems from obsessive precision. You register ''Maidan'' just as you do the well-known paintings of horror from, say, the Spanish Civil War and the French Revolution: Not an interpretation, but an artwork capturing the truth of a historic moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmakermagazine.com/88644-never-the-twain-shall-meet-maidan/|title=Never the Twain Shall Meet: Maidan|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Walber of Nonfics, called the film "a portrait of a people, a place and a moment rather than a dissertation on its context or implications. It is raw, unflinching cinema for a troubled nation in a great and terrible moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nonfics.com/maidan-review/|title='Maidan' Review: A Grand, Unflinching Epic of the Ukrainian Revolution|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oleg Ivanov of ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, writing that "[i]t puts the viewer inside Maidan, allowing them to draw their own conclusions about the ideas and agendas espoused by the movement's leaders and participants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/maidan|title=FILM REVIEW|accessdate=January 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden''''' ({{lang|zh|芥子園畫傳}}, '''{{transl|zh|Jieziyuan Huazhuan}}'''), sometimes known as '''{{transl|zh|Jieziyuan Huapu}}''' ({{lang|zh|芥子園畫譜}}), is a printed manual of [[Chinese painting]] compiled during the early-[[Qing Dynasty]]. Many renowned later Chinese painters, like [[Qi Baishi]], began their drawing lessons with the manual.  It is an important early example of [[colour printing]].

The work was commissioned by Shen Xinyou ({{lang|zh|沈心友}}), son-in-law of the famous playwright [[Li Yu (author)|Li Yu]], whose mansion in [[Lanxi, Zhejiang|Lanxi]], [[Zhejiang]] province was known as Jieziyuan, or Mustard Seed Garden. Shen possessed the teaching materials of Li Liufang (李流芳), a painter of the late-[[Ming dynasty]], and commissioned Wáng Gài ({{lang|zh|王概}}), Wáng Shī ({{lang|zh|王蓍}}), Wáng Niè ({{lang|zh|王臬}}) and Zhū Shēng ({{lang|zh|诸升}}) to edit and expand those materials with the aim of producing a manual for landscape painting. The result was the first part of {{transl|zh|Jieziyuan Huazhuan}}, which, published in 1679 in five colours, comprises five {{transl|zh|juan}} ({{lang|zh|卷}}) or [[Serial (literature)|fascicles]]. Li Yu, as the publisher, wrote a preface for this part. The first fascicle deals with the general principles of landscape painting, the second the painting of trees, the third that of hills and stones, the fourth that of people and houses, and the fifth comprises the selected works of great landscape painters.

[[File:Jieziyuan Huazhuan 2.jpg|thumb|alt=Scan of page from book depicting instructions for drawing people|Teaching how to draw people]]

The volume also entered [[Edo period]] Japan, where [[woodblock printed]] copies became relatively easily accessible in all the major cities; the ''Mustard Seed Garden Manual'' came to be used by a great many Japanese artists and was a major element in the training of artists and the development of Edo period painting.

Two more parts, which deal with the painting of flora and fauna, were produced by Wang and his two brothers and published 1701. Shen promised a fourth part, but never published it. A fourth part, which deals with portraits, was produced by some quick profit-seeking publisher, though. Chao Xun ({{lang|zh|巢勛}}) (1852–1917), dissatisfied with the fake, produced his own sequel, as well as carefully reproduced the first three volumes. Reprints of the first three volumes are usually based on Chao's reproduction.

An English translation of the work, ''The Tao of Painting – A study of the ritual disposition of Chinese painting. With a translation of the Chieh Tzu Yuan Hua Chuan or Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting 1679–1701'', was made by [[Mai-mai Sze]] and published in New York in 1956.

'''''Marley &amp; Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog''''' is a ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' bestselling autobiographical book by journalist [[John Grogan (journalist)|John Grogan]], published in 2005, about the thirteen years he and his family spent with their yellow [[Labrador Retriever]], Marley. The dog is poorly behaved and destructive, and the book covers the issues this causes in the family as they learn to accept him in addition to their grief following Marley's death. It has subsequently been adapted by the author in three separate books, as well as separately into a [[Marley &amp; Me (film)|comedy-drama film]] released in 2008.

==Story==
Told in [[first-person narrative]], the book portrays Grogan and his family's life during the thirteen years that they lived with their dog Marley, and the relationships and lessons from this period. Marley, a yellow [[Labrador Retriever]], is described as a high-strung, boisterous,  and somewhat uncontrolled dog. He is strong, powerful, endlessly hungry, eager to be active, and often destructive of their property (but completely without malice). Marley routinely fails to "get the idea" of what humans expect of him; at one point, mental illness is suggested as a plausible explanation for his behavior. His acts and behaviors are forgiven, however, since it is clear that he has a heart of gold and is merely living within his nature.

Marley was filmed for a two-minute credited appearance in the 1996 movie ''[[The Last Home Run]]''.

The strong contrast between the problems and tensions caused by his neuroses and behavior, and the undying devotion, love and trust shown towards the human family as they themselves have children and grow up to accept him for what he is, and their grief when he finally dies from [[gastric dilatation volvulus]] (a stomach torsion condition) in old age, form the backdrop for the biographical material of the story.

In the autobiography, the author states that the eulogy he wrote in his [[The Philadelphia Inquirer|newspaper]] following the death of his dog received more responses than any other column he had written in his professional life up until that point.&lt;ref&gt;"Marley &amp; Me" ch. 29 p. 281-282: ''A recorded warning I had never heard before. "Your mailbox is full" [...]. I logged onto my computer and opened my e-mail. Same story. [...] This morning there were hundreds, far more than anything I had received before.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
''Marley &amp; Me'' has been rewritten into three different books:
* ''Marley: A Dog Like No Other'', for younger readers who would enjoy reading about Marley's story, without the sexual content in the original
* ''Bad Dog, Marley!'', a picture book for readers learning to read in lower grade levels
* ''A Very Marley Christmas''

In 2008, the novel was adapted into a family comedy-drama motion picture, also titled ''[[Marley &amp; Me (film)|Marley &amp; Me]]''. Released on December 25, 2008, the film stars [[Owen Wilson]] and [[Jennifer Aniston]] and is directed by [[David Frankel]]. A prequel followed in 2011, ''[[Marley &amp; Me: The Puppy Years]]''.

==Author's comments==
In a discussion on his website devoted to the book, Grogan looks back on his family's time with Marley, and the lessons learned, and concludes that: "[C]ommitment matters. That 'in good times and bad, in sickness and in health' really means something. We didn't give up on Marley when it would have been easy to, and in the end he came through and proved himself a great and memorable pet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johngroganbooks.com/marley/qanda.html|title=Marley &amp; Me Q&amp;A|last=Grogan|first=John|publisher=John Grogan's "Marley &amp; Me" website|accessdate=2009-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Murals in Northern Ireland''' have become symbols of [[Northern Ireland]], depicting the region's past and present political and religious divisions.

[[Belfast]] and [[Derry]] contain arguably the most famous political [[murals]] in [[Europe]]. It is believed that almost 2,000 murals have been documented since the 1970s. In 2014, the book, ''The Belfast Mural Guide'' estimated that, in Belfast, there were approximately 300 quality murals on display, with many more in varying degrees of age and decay. Murals commemorate, communicate and display aspects of culture and history. The themes of murals often reflect what is important to a particular community. A mural therefore exists to express an idea or message and could generally be seen as reflecting values held dear to that community.

In [[Irish republican]] areas the themes of murals can range from the [[1981 Irish hunger strike]], with particular emphasis on strike leader [[Bobby Sands]]; murals of international solidarity with revolutionary groups are equally common, as are those which highlight a particular issue, for example the [[Ballymurphy Massacre]] or the [[McGurk's Bar bombing]]. In working class [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] communities, murals are used to promote [[Ulster loyalist]] paramilitary groups such as the [[Ulster Defence Association]] and [[Ulster Volunteer Force]] and commemorate their deceased members. However traditional themes such as [[William III of England]] and the [[Battle of the Boyne]], the [[Battle of the Somme]] and the [[36th Ulster Division]] are equally common.&lt;ref&gt;Maxamillian Rapp: Murals in Ulster: Symbol kultureller Revolution im nordirischen Bürgerkrieg. In: KultuRRevolution Nr. 61/62 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Early loyalist mural.jpg|thumb|A Loyalist political mural in Londonderry circa 1920]]
Murals can be described as a mirror of political change, as they have been painted throughout the last century and display all important historic as well as political developments in the scope of unique wall paintings. In 1908 [[Ulster loyalist]]s started to portray [[William III of England]] on a white horse in order to strengthen the [[Orange Order|Orange identity]] of [[Ulster Protestants]]. [[Irish republican]] wall-paintings started in the late 1970s and can be seen in particular as a visual display of a social movement, which was radicalized after the IRA began to fight for a greater political voice and a [[United Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;Maximilian Rapp and Markus Rhomberg: The importance of Murals during the Troubles: Analyzing the republican use of wall paintings in Northern Ireland. In: Machin, D. (Ed.) Visual Communication Reader. De Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt;

Murals are for the most part located in working class areas of Northern Ireland, primarily in [[Belfast]] and [[Derry]].  Arguably the most well-known and easily identified mural is that of [[Bobby Sands]], on the side wall of [[Sinn Féin]]'s [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]] office.  A close second is the collection of Irish republican and international-themed murals which are located at what is known as 'The International Wall', also in Belfast. In Derry, [[Free Derry Corner]], where the slogan "You Are Now Entering Free Derry" was painted in 1969 shortly after the [[Battle of the Bogside]], is prominent. Not everyone considers Free Derry Corner to be a true mural, as it consists only of words and not images. Free Derry Corner has been used as a model for other murals in Northern Ireland, including the "You Are Now Entering Loyalist Sandy Row" mural in Belfast, which was a response to the republican message of Free Derry Corner, and the "You Are Now Entering ''[[Derry Journal]]'' Country" mural, which is an advertisement for a Derry publication.

Not all murals in Northern Ireland are directly political or sectarian in nature, with some commemorating events such as the [[Great Irish Famine|Great Irish Famine (1845–1849)]], and other moments in [[History of Ireland|Irish history]]. Many portray events from [[Irish mythology]], and images from Irish myths are often incorporated into political murals. A few murals avoid the subject of Ireland altogether, instead focusing on such neutral subjects as litter prevention and the [[C. S. Lewis]] novel ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]''. Murals representing peace and tolerance are becoming increasingly popular with school groups who have children either design or actually paint murals in areas around their schools. With many paramilitaries now involved in community work, there has been a move to decommission many of the hard-edged murals across Northern Ireland (although this trend is reversed in times of tension).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4562793.stm |title= Old masters change murals |accessdate=28 November 2008 |last=  |first= |coauthors= |date= 31 May 2005 |work= |publisher= [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change was further highlighted in 2007, when the [[Bogside Artists]] were invited to Washington, D.C. for the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]] Folk Life Festival. The three artists were invited to recreate murals in the [[National Mall|Washington Mall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/6231216.stm |title= Painting a New Image of NI |accessdate=28 November 2008 |last= Taggart |first= Maggie |coauthors= |date= 22 June 2007 |work= |publisher= [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nina Dotti''' is a character created and interpreted by Venezuelan-born conceptual and performance artist, [[Nina Fuentes]].

== Character profile ==
In her role as Nina Dotti, Fuentes employs a multi-dimensional approach to critically exploring social, cultural and political issues confronting contemporary society.

Dotti was a multimedia, Miami-based contemporary artist. A pioneering artist in her native [[Venezuela]] working for the rights of the [[LGBT community]], she has been described as a feminist artist. Her message is critical, intimate and personal. Her work is neo-conceptual, influenced by [[Marcel Duchamps]], with a pop and surrealistic aesthetic. Her installations are characterized by the use of non-traditional materials and domestic items, making them particularly political.

== Early career ==
Nina was interested in the representation of social stereotypes (especially feminist issues) and the defense of sexual minorities. This gave her the opportunity to assume an artistic alter-ego who would make a blunt statement regarding her identity: Nina Dotti would be her new name, inspired by Italian photographer [[Tina Modotti]], who had to change her identity to work as an artist. This represented an analogy for what Nina had always stood for: equal rights, end of discrimination and the opportunity for people to be whoever they want to be. She signed her new work "Plataforma: Forma de hacer plata" (Money-making Platform) (2005) produced for the "Transito" NGO (2005) and inspired from the [[platform shoes]] used by [[transsexual]]s. That year, Nina performed the streets of Chicago wearing a wedding dress, during which symbolic blessings were given to both [[homosexual]] and [[heterosexual]] couples as a way to express equality.

== Performances, exhibits and installations 2006–2014 ==
[[File:Let it Go the Best is yet to come.jpg|thumb|right|Let it Go the Best is yet to come]]

=== Pastel de Boda (Wedding Cake) ===
"Pastel de Boda" (Wedding Cake) was presented in Miami's Hardcore Art Contemporary Spaces (HACS), in a performance in which Dotti would "marry" her crowd. This was followed by "Hot Flashes Bar", presented during the Arte Americas Art Fair in 2006 where Dotti shared her positive views of [[menopause]] with women in a bar, suggesting humor as a way to replace unhealthy medical treatment like [[hormone replacement therapy]] in what she called Humor Replacement Therapy, thus empowering women to face menopause as a normal part of life and experience a new kind of sexuality. 

Other installations such as The Wedding Cake were presented in the gardens of the International Community Church at [[Lincoln Road]] in [[South Beach]], Miami during the city's [[Art Basel]] 2006. This piece consisted of an immense wedding cake topped with real couples. From here onwards, "Picture Perfect Wedding Toppers" would become her means to express her firm belief that anyone can stand atop a wedding cake and experience life from above, from the most idealistic and [[romance (love)|romantic]] vantage point. The cake had three huge tiers that people climbed up to, "Groom" and "Bride" accessories and wedding rings were available to wear and exchange. Couples from all sexual orientations and entire families climbed up the challenging wooden stairs situated behind the decorated cake. The piece was accompanied by a music piece created in collaboration with Franchesca Saiden and Iris Cegarra with more than 480 wedding songs of all religions and many countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://av.celarg.org.ve/Albumdebodas/portalAlbum.htm CELARG]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In March 2007 she performed at the "Circa '07" art in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], in which she received favorable critical reviews with "Blue Pillar Bar", calling it a Celebration of Menopause and Andropause. This was followed by "Dotti's 99 Cent Clichés" presented at Miami's Hard Core Art Space (HCAS), with a kitsch ensemble of the now famous Dollar stores, Dotti mocks consumer frenzy in society.

=== Superwoman ===
Her Superwoman project was based on the [[Supergirl]] [[comics]], transformed into her own interpretation of what a [[superwoman]] should be: "free, capable of living with her complexity in a non-conflictive way". Also in 2006, and as the result of her simultaneous endeavors as art merchant and gallery owner, Nina was invited to exhibit two of her best-known installations "Wedding Cake" and "P.M.S." at Gallerie 13 Jeanette Mariani in Paris. 

Her pieces revealed a three-edged speech symbolized by the three roles a modern woman must juggle simultaneously: a princess to her parents, a mother to her children and a superwoman in front of life. Nina has explored all major artistic disciplines from [[sculpture]] to [[photography]] and from [[mixed media]] to [[painting]]. She uses diverse materials freely on her installations and this pattern is consistent with her attitude towards life, where freedom to choose always prevails. 

In 2008 Nina took part in an exhibition called "Cartografías Meridionales" (Southern Cartography) presented at the Museum of Contemporary Art of Rosario, in the city of Rosario, Argentina, in which her P.M.S. performance was shown again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macromuseo.org.ar/archivo/2008/08/cartografias.htm Romer, Marcella.

=== Golden Nina ===

ARTPULSE Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; was showcased, presenting a blend of different techniques ranging from video installations to sculpture and photography, all encased in gold, a metaphor for the power of wealth and its impact on everyday life, as expressed on Dotti's series of photographs titled Golden Nina.

=== Doña Delincuente ===
[[File:D Delincuente.png|right|thumb|D Delincuente]]
During one of Dotti's many trips to Colombia, she spoke with her grandmother about her origins. She learned that her great-grandfather owned brothels, that some lands under her family's name are yet to be claimed, as well as learning of her origins as a [[Sephardic Jew]]. This generated an exhibit in the city of Bucaramanga (2014) titled "Doña Delincuente – 13 historias" (Madame Delinquent – 13 Stories),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senalradiocolombia.gov.co/noticia/do-delincuente-y-el-secreto-de-la-familia-mac. Cristancho, Andres. Señal Radio Colombia. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; and later her works are represented by Artemisia gallery. This new character created by Nina is inspired by modern Latin American [[Syncretism]] in which criminals are revered as saints, with statues for veneration and prayer, as well as a prayer dedicated to Doña Delincuencia. This captured the attention of the citizens, leading to the production of a brand of drink, as well as a local tobacco brand.

=== Miss Wynwood ===
[[File:Miss Wynwood.png|right|thumb|Miss Wynwood]]
Nina developed a character based on the story of a Venezuelan [[Miss Universe]]-turned-politician called Irene Sáez, who after serving as Mayor of Chacao (Caracas' highest-end municipality), was lured by one of the old establishment parties to oppose [[Hugo Chávez]] only to later be dumped by her party shortly before Election Day. Nina turned herself into a beauty queen elected as the Mayor of Wynwood and walking the streets in a provocative performance called "Miss Wynwood", presented at Miami's [[Art Basel]] 2014 edition.

== Wynwood Times ==
In May 2015, Nina started editing a newspaper, ''The Wynwood Times'' that covers news, art, dining, trends and social issues with humor and irony.

== Depójate ==
In July 2015, Nina took her exhibit Depójate/Take The Load Off to Kiosco Galería in Santa Cruz de La Sierra, Bolivia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eldeber.com.bo/escenas/nina-dotti-y-obra-invita.html Manjón, Adhemar. "Nina Dotti y una obra que invita a olvidar el pasado" Diario El Deber, Bolivia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
* On 16 February 2015, [[President Day]], "Nina Fuentes Day" was declared by the Board of [[Miami-Dade]] County Commissioners, recognizing the artist as an "ambassador of the arts" in the South Florida community and accepted by Miss Wynwood during a performance at The Chill Concept, where a copy of the document is buried on the grounds in a time capsule before a live audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariolasamericas.com/5021_tiempo-libre/2825682_nina-dotti-sera-alcalde-de-wynwood-en-un-performance.html miss wynwood performance]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculptural installations===
In the 1980s, Harding built several installations around the theme of agriculture and the environment. In 1980 he was commissioned by the [[Ikon Gallery]] in [[Birmingham]], England to produce the work ''Scenic Events on A Path of Upheaval''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Umbrella|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tmhUAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Umbrella Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCCA-Scenic-events-path"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scenic Events on a Path of Upheaval, (view 5 of 5)|url=http://ccca.concordia.ca/artists/work_detail.html?languagePref=en&amp;mkey=5713&amp;title=Scenic+Events+on+a+Path+of+Upheaval%2C+(view+5+of+5)&amp;artist=Noel+Harding&amp;link_id=204|website=CCCA|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Scenic Events'', a small cart carrying live heads of lettuce traverses the gallery while goldfish swim in a wraparound tank along the gallery walls, and an overhead speaker relays the sound of bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vanguard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x1BUAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=Vancouver Art Gallery.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harding is reported to have made the work as a response to the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] that began in late 1979.&lt;ref name="Globe-scenic-review-1993"&gt;{{cite web|title=The art that refreshes|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/the-art-that-refreshes/article752234/|website=The Globe and Mail|last1=Milroy|first1=Sarah|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1981 piece ''Enclosure for a Conventional Habitat'', he created a work that placed six live chickens on a conveyor belt with an automatic feeding mechanism.

===Public art===
From the 1990s until his death, Harding produced primarily public artworks. In 1990 he completed and installed "The Potato Eaters" at the [[Mississauga Civic Centre]].&lt;ref name="Murray1999"/&gt; This was followed by ''The Elevated Wetlands'' in 1997 and 1998. Installed in Taylor Creek park, Toronto, the piece consists of a set of elevated gardens supported on sculptures made of recycled polystyrene and acrylic.&lt;ref name="ElevatedWetlands-Toronto" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Treehugger-wetlands"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alter|first1=Lloyd|title=Art and function combined|url=http://www.treehugger.com/sustainable-product-design/elevated-wetlands-art-and-function-combined.html|website=Treehugger|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="France2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Lawrence France|title=Facilitating Watershed Management: Fostering Awareness and Stewardship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSaARmkEMdIC&amp;pg=PA289|year=2005|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-3364-6|pages=289–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PearsonNasby2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Craig Pearson|author2=Judith Nasby|title=The Cultivated Landscape: An Exploration of Art and Agriculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Vg0FAHCPUpoC&amp;pg=PT316|date=11 August 2008|publisher=MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-7837-1|pages=316–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculptures act as a water filtration system, using [[solar panels]] to pump water from the adjacent [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] into the sculpture's elevated wetlands, where the water is purified organically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Landscape Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rXlMAAAAYAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Lay, Hubbard &amp; Wheelright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Harvard Design Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oJJMAAAAYAAJ|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Graduate School of Design}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rampike|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gDtAAQAAIAAJ|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Elevated Wetlands is his most well known work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Micaleff|first1=Shawn|title=Remembering artist and urban innovator Noel Harding’s legacy|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/2016/06/18/remembering-artist-and-urban-innovator-noel-hardings-legacy.html|accessdate=19 June 2016|work=[[The Toronto Star]]|date=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 he installed the public sculpture ''Dawes Crossing'' at the intersection of Dawes Road and Victoria Park Avenue in Toronto, Ontario. The piece integrates the outline of a traditional barn with a solar wand wind-powered system that irrigates a small garden beneath the barn.&lt;ref name="Sun-Dawes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levy|first1=Sue-Ann|title=Public art failure|url=http://www.torontosun.com/2011/11/13/public-art-failure|website=Toronto Sun|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was negatively received by some local residents, who were confused as to what the purpose of the structure was.&lt;ref name="NatPost-Dawes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hudes|first1=Sammy|title=With 200 pieces of city-owned art, some are bound to raise eyebrows|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/toronto/with-200-pieces-of-city-owned-art-some-are-bound-to-raise-eyebrows|website=National Post|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Observer-Dawes-Crossing"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Korhani|first1=Vida|title=New art barn at Dawes Road ‘confusing’: residents|url=http://torontoobserver.ca/2013/02/07/public-art-on-display-at-dawes-road-barn-raising/|website=Toronto Observer|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Harding completed the public sculpture ''Reverb'' outside the [[General Motors Centre]] in [[Oshawa]], Ontario.&lt;ref name="Oshawa-public" /&gt;

Just prior to his death in 2016, Harding had been selected to create a public artwork outside the [[Royal York (TTC)]] subway station in Toronto Ontario.&lt;ref name="Metro-RoyalYork"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bateman|first1=Chris|title=Artistic overhaul coming to five TTC subway stations|url=http://www.metronews.ca/news/toronto/2015/12/09/artistic-overhaul-coming-to-five-ttc-subway-stations.html|website=Metronews.ca|accessdate=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pavilion by the Lake''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''{{lang|zh|湖边凉亭}}'') is a painting during [[Korean peninsula]]’s [[Joseon dynasty]] period. Created in the late 18th century AD, this painting measures 45.4 cm in height and 27.6 cm in width. This painting is created by an unknown artist whose style name is ''Samoje'' (literally, "Studio of Three-Five"). The artist, probably a professional painter from the ''jungin'' (middle people) class of [[Joseon dynasty]] cannot be ascertained due to lack of documentation. So it is difficult to confirm the identity and the given name of the artist.&lt;ref name=met&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/40429 |title=Pavilion by the Lake |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The composition of the "Pavilion by the Lake" were likely adapted from popular painting manuals of [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) imported from [[China]]. One of the most prominent examples for those painting manuals was the ''[[Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden|Mustard Seed Garden]]'' ({{zh|芥子園畫傳}}, Jieziyuan Huazhuan) manual of painting.&lt;ref name=jour&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Hiscox M J |author2=Sze M |title=The Mustard Seed Garden Manual of Painting[M] |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1977 |access-date=2017-11-22|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/chapter/1548966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dsecription==
With Chinese influence, [[Korean peninsula]]’s painting originated during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms period]] in the form of mural painting. It eventually developed into monochrome painting or light painting. Naturalistic themes became popular subjects for Korean painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.artxun.com/guohua-1730-8647937.shtml |title=崔成龙朝鲜国画赏析 和谐清雅的审美世界 |date=2013-08-26 |publisher=博宝资讯网 |accessdate=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Pavilion by the Lake‍", belonging to the late 18th century, was created during [[Korean peninsula]]’s [[Joseon dynasty]] period. It might be painted by a professional painter belonging to ''jungin'' or the middle people of Joseon. This painting measures 45.4 cm in height and 27.6 cm in width. The painter has used the term ''Samoje'' (literally, "Studio of Three-Five") as his style name. But neither definite identity nor the given name of the painter has ascertained.&lt;ref name=met /&gt; Current view is that "Pavilion by the Lake" was probably adapted from a popular [[Ming dynasty]] painting manual imported from [[China]], such as the famous "''Mustard Seed Garden''" painting manual.&lt;ref name=jour /&gt; In 1915, the painting was donated to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] by Rogers foundation. The painting was exhibited at the Korean Art exhibition of Metropolitan Museum in 2006 and 2010 respectively.&lt;ref name=met /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10727">[[Image:Pierre Lévy.jpg|250px|thumb|Pierre Lévy]]
'''Pierre Lévy''' ({{IPA-fr|levi|lang}}; born 1956 in [[Tunis]]) is a [[French people|French]] philosopher, [[Culture theory|cultural theorist]] and [[media scholar]] who specializes in the understanding of the cultural and cognitive implications of digital technologies and the phenomenon of human collective intelligence.

He introduced the [[collective intelligence]] concept in his 1994 book ''L'intelligence collective: Pour une anthropologie du cyberspace'' (''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace'').&lt;ref&gt;L'intelligence collective. Pour une anthropologie du cyberspace, Paris, La Découverte, 1994 ({{ISBN|2-7071-2693-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; Lévy's 1995 book, ''Qu'est-ce que le virtuel?'' (translated as ''Becoming Virtual: Reality in the Digital Age'') develops philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]]'s conception of "the virtual" as a dimension of reality that subsists with the actual but is irreducible to it. In 2001, he wrote the  book ''Cyberculture''.

Pierre Lévy currently teaches at the communication department of the [[University of Ottawa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article13 |title=ieml |publisher=ieml |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032913/http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article13 |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; where he holds a Canada Research Chair in Collective Intelligence. Lévy is fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] and received several awards and academic distinctions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Life and work==
Pierre Lévy is one of the major philosophers working on the implications of [[cyberspace]] and digital communications. Lévy has written a dozen of books that have been translated in more than 12 languages and are studied in many universities all over the world. His principal work, published in French in 1994 and translated into English, is entitled ''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace''.&lt;ref&gt;''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace'' {{ISBN|0-7382-0261-4}} Perseus, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1990 Lévy published a book about the merging of digital networks and [[Hypertext|hypertextual]] communication. Levy's theory of knowledge spaces and the cosmopedia foreshadowed the emergence of Wikipedia and anticipates [[wikinomics]], and the efficacy of shared distributed knowledge systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levy|first=Pierre|title=Collective Intelligence|year=1997|publisher=Plenium Trade|location=New York and London|isbn=0306456354|pages=215–220|quote=.  In the fourth space, "the subject of knowledge is shaped by its encyclopedia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993 to 1998 Lévy was Professor at the [[University of Paris VIII: Vincennes—Saint-Denis|University of Paris VIII]], where he studied the concept of collective intelligence and knowledge-based societies. He has contributed to many scholarly discourses about [[cyberculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cochran|first=Terry|title=Thinking at the Edge of the Galaxy: Pierre Levy's World Projection|journal=Boundary|year=1999|volume=2|series=26|issue=3|pages=63–85|url=http://muse.jhu.edu.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/journals/boundary/v026/26.3cochran.html|accessdate=July 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the editorial board of the ''[[Revue virtuelle]]'' project of the [[Pompidou Center]] in Paris from 1995 to 1997 and was the author of a report on cyberculture for the Council of Europe in 1996.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In the chapter [[Interactivity]] from his book ''Cyberculture'' (2001), Lévy argues that analogue communication (telephone, mail) differs from digital communication (email, chat) in terms of temporal organization and material involvement of their communication systems. He claims that [[interactivity]] is a vague term that "has more to do with finding the solution to a problem, the need to develop new ways to observe, design, and evaluate methods of communication, than it does with identifying a simple, unique characteristic that can be assigned to a given system".&lt;ref&gt;Lévy, Pierre. "Cyberculture". Univ. of Minnesota Press. 2001, p. 228. ({{ISBN|0816636109}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Jenkins]], among others, cites him as an important influence on theories of online collective intelligence.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In ''Becoming Virtual: Reality in the Digital Age'' Lévy explores the way we virtualise every aspect of our lives, from [[real time (media)]] interaction through language, to our actions through technology, and our social relations through institutions.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} And in each case the mechanism is the same: we create some artifact, more or less material, which allows us to shift what's at stake away from the immediate here-and-now and towards a problematic where new possibilities open up.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Current project==
Lévy's current project focuses on the development of an [[Information Economy MetaLanguage]] (IEML) for the purposes of improving knowledge management as part of his works on the design of a universal system for [[semantic]] addressing of digital documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article9&amp;lang=en |title=ieml |publisher=ieml |date= |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924032920/http://www.ieml.org/spip.php?article9&amp;lang=en |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Álvaro |first=Sandra |url=http://blogs.cccb.org/lab/en/article_ieml-projecte-per-a-un-nou-humanisme-entrevista-a-pierre-levy/ |title=IEML: A PROJECT FOR A NEW HUMANISM.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13338">A '''pornographic parody film''' is a subgenre of the [[pornography|pornographic film industry]] genre where the basis for the production's story or [[plotline]] is the parody of a [[mainstream]] [[television show]], [[feature film]], [[public figure]], [[video game]] or literary works. This subgenre also includes parody of historical or contemporary events such as [[political scandal]]s. The subgenre has gained acceptance by the adult industry to the extent that major awards are presented in  this category by organizations such as [[31st AVN Awards#Major Awards|AVN]] and [[XRCO Award#Best Comedy or Parody|XRCO]].

==Origin==
''PornParody.com'', a website dedicated to reviewing porn parodies, cites the 1973 ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' spoof ''[[Bat Pussy]]'' as possibly the earliest known pornographic parody film,&lt;ref name="BPPornParody"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pornparody.com/2014/10/bat-pussy-the-first-superhero-porn-parody/ |title=Bat Pussy – the first superhero porn parody? |date=October 6, 2014 |publisher=PornParody.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008174205/http://pornparody.com/2014/10/bat-pussy-the-first-superhero-porn-parody/ |archivedate=October 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a title which is also shared with the 1973 German animated short ''[[Snow White and the Seven Perverts]]''.&lt;ref name=1973Snow&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Snow White and the Seven Perverts (1973) 11 min - Animation : Short : Comedy|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0782084/|publisher=Amazon via IMDb|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subgenre began taking off in the 1990s,&lt;ref name=Brilliant&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=The 14 Most Brilliant Porn Parodies of All Time|url=http://www.details.com/sex-relationships/porn-and-perversions/201002/the-most-brilliant-porn-parodies-of-all-time#/slide=4|publisher=Conde Nast via Details.com|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; experiencing a surge in popularity during the 2000s and 2010s.&lt;ref name=Wave&gt;{{cite web|last=Rutter|first=Jarod|title=The Big New Wave of Porn Parodies|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/The-Big-New-Wave-of-Porn-Parodies-348804.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
In 2002, ''Shaving Ryan's Privates'', a movie starring actor-turned-infosec analyst Jeff Bardin, was released. The movie documented porn films that parody classic Hollywood movies. There have been porn parodies produced of [[sitcoms]] such as ''[[Who's The Boss]]'' and ''[[Parks and Recreation]]'', horror and drama movies such as ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|Silence of the Lambs]]'', [[sci-fi]] and [[action movie]] blockbusters such as ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', and of [[Costume drama|period drama]] such as ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', titled ''[[Down on Abby]]''. The genre includes both [[heterosexual]] as well as [[homosexual]] versions as a "gay porn parody" of the [[reality television series]] ''[[Duck Dynasty]]'' has been produced among others. Parodies also include non-story or event specific productions such as the [[Who's Nailin' Paylin?|several parodies]] that feature a [[Sarah Palin]]-like character.&lt;ref name=AVNPalinPorn&gt;{{cite web|last=Krasner|first=Paul|title=Behind the Sarah Palin Porn Movie|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/technology/Behind-the-Sarah-Palin-Porn-Movie-56373.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VH1&gt;{{cite web|last=Spencer|first=Kate|title=The Complete Guide To Porn Parodies of Movies,TV, Celebrities and Politicians|url=http://www.vh1.com/celebrity/2013-12-19/porn-parody/|publisher=[[VH1]]|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=io9Guide&gt;{{cite web|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|title=The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction and Fantasy Porn Parodies [NSFW]|url=http://io9.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-science-fiction-and-fantasy-porn-1217176178|publisher=io9.com|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Some parodies utilize techniques such as [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]].&lt;ref name=HuffSW&gt;{{cite web|last=Zakarin|first=Jordan|title='Star Wars XXX: A Porn Parody' Trailer (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/09/star-wars-xxx-a-porn-paro_n_1194950.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One movie reviewer commented that the costume of a particular [[comic book]] character in a porn parody was a "better version" of the one used in the mainstream movie.&lt;ref name=BaDigest&gt;{{cite web|last=Faraci|first=Devin|title=The Porno Version Of Quicksilver Looks Better Than The X-MEN Version|url=http://badassdigest.com/2014/02/02/the-porno-version-of-quicksilver-looks-better-than-the-x-men-version/|publisher=Badass Digest|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and review==
Journalist and author [[Charlie Jane Anders]] wrote, prior to blogging on the subject, "I didn't realize just how many porn parodies there are — and how terrible most of them actually are."&lt;ref name=io9&gt;{{cite web|last=Anders|first=Charlie Jane|title=The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction and Fantasy Porn Parodies [NSFW]|url=http://io9.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-science-fiction-and-fantasy-porn-1217176178|publisher=io9.com|accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[New York (magazine)|''New York'' magazine]] writer commented that although the parody of the [[PBS]] series ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' titled ''Down on Abby'' starring Lexi Lowe is humorous, it is "rife with historical inaccuracies" and "not recommended for those who get distracted by historically inaccurate details like squared-off [[French manicure|French tips]] and [[Thong (clothing)|thongs]]."&lt;ref name=NYMag&gt;{{cite web|last=Stoeffel|first=Kat|title=Downton Abbey Porn Parody Rife With Historical Inaccuracies|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2014/01/downton-abbey-porn-rife-with-inaccuracies.html|publisher=New York Magazine|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry acceptance===
Acknowledging its origins and public appeal,&lt;ref name=parody/&gt; several industry publications and trade groups have created award categories for the genre. Two of the industry's major award programs offer recognition for this category of adult film.

===Mainstream media===
The genre has gained the attention of the [[mainstream press]]. In 2009 director Jeff Mullen (a.k.a. [[Will Ryder]]) was interviewed by ''[[Newsweek]]'' writer Joshua Alston about his leading role in the resurgence of porn parodies.&lt;ref name=AVNNewsweek&gt;{{cite web|last=Warren|first=Peter|title='Newsweek' Talks to Jeff Mullen About Porn Parodies|url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Newsweek-Talks-to-Jeff-Mullen-About-Porn-Parodies-357597.html|publisher=Adult Video News|accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;{{cite news|last=Alston|first=Joshua|title=Porn Parody of TV Sitcoms Is Adult Entertainment's 'New Gold Rush'|url=http://www.newsweek.com/porn-parody-tv-sitcoms-adult-entertainments-new-gold-rush-220586 |accessdate=25 February 2014|publisher=''Newsweek''|date=27 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''[[Adult Video News]]'' writer Tom Hymes observed, "I have come to the realization that a very real expectation is being created among the celebrity elite: Will my show be the next XXX parody... please?" "What is kind of brilliant about the whole thing is the fact that these mainstream shows and the actors on them now get to rub shoulders with the porn industry without any actual rubbing. That's why I call them the new celebrity-safe sex tapes for safe-sex celebrities."&lt;ref name=CelebSafe&gt;{{cite web |last=Hymes |first=Tom |title=Are Porn Parodies the New Celebrity-Safe Sex Vid? |url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Are-Porn-Parodies-the-New-Celebrity-Safe-Sex-Vid-366766.html |publisher=Adult Video News |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' interview with [[Alan Ball (screenwriter)|Alan Ball]], creator of the [[HBO]] original series ''True Blood'', he stated, "We just found out that they're doing a porn parody of ''[[True Blood]]''. That's certainly a moment of going 'Wow, we've arrived.'"&lt;ref name=2010PaquinTruXXX&gt;{{cite web |last=Javors |first=Steve |title=Ann Paquin Gifts 'True Blood' Porn Parody to Cast, Crew |url=http://business.avn.com/articles/video/Ann-Paquin-Gifts-True-Blood-Porn-Parody-to-Cast-Crew-407676.html |work=[[Adult Video News]] |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, actress [[Anna Paquin]] talked about the porn parody of her own show, ''[[True Blood]]'', on the [[TBS (TV network)|TBS]] late night [[talk show]] ''[[Lopez Tonight]]''. Paquin stated, "You know, actually what's interesting is that [fellow cast member] [[Stephen Moyer|Steve]] [Moyer] and I were so amused by it that we got it for everyone on our cast and crew as a wrap gift so I think we probably bought every copy in existence." Copies of ''Tru: A XXX Parody'' were given to the entire cast and crew at the [[wrap party]] for the show's [[True Blood (season 3)|third season]].&lt;ref name=2010PaquinTruXXX/&gt;

==Fictional pornography==

Fictional pornography is sometimes used for plot or humor in mainstream film and TV. In ''[[Friends]]'', [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe's]] twin sister starred in ''Buffay, the Vampire Layer'' among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alloy.com/entertainment/the-7-best-instances-of-doppelganger-sex/4/|title=The 7 Best Instances of Doppelganger Sex - Page 4 of 4|date=7 July 2011|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List_of_Two_and_a_Half_Men_characters#Lyndsey_McElroy|Lyndsey]] in ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'' was the title role of ''Cinnamon's Buns'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/two-and-a-half-men-keeps-getting-worse-cinnamons-buns-and-master-bakin-1848199441.html|title='Two And A Half Men' Keeps Getting Worse – 'Cinnamon's Buns And Master Baking' Recap|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James Wilson (House)|Wilson]] in ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' acted in ''Feral Pleasures''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/article/2010/03/09/house-wilson-and-wood-nymphs-made-a-porno/|title='House': Wilson and wood nymphs made a porno|date=9 March 2010|publisher=|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Stormare]]'s character in ''[[The Big Lebowski]]'' can be seen in ''Logjammin'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.moviefone.com/2010/04/07/does-the-big-lebowski-porn-parody-actually-look-good/|title=Does 'The Big Lebowski' Porn Parody Actually Look Good?|first=Alison|last=Nastasi|date=7 April 2010|website=AOL Moviefone|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Portrait of a man with a beer jug''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Frans Hals]], painted in the early 1630s, now in a private collection.

==Painting ==
This painting was documented by [[Seymour Slive]] in 1974, who claimed that it was in the collection of [[Henry Reichhold]] in White Plains, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Frans Hals, by Seymour Slive, 1974 a catalog raisonné of Hals works by Seymour Slive: Volume Three, the catalogue, National gallery of Art: Kress Foundation, Studies in the History of European Art, London - Phaidon Press, 1974, catalog #74, pp. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of a red deer on the front of the beer jug corresponds with the house name "Het Rode Hert" of the Haarlem beer brewer [[Cornelis Guldewagen]], whose portrait was painted by Hals in 1660. Though the genre of the work is similar to works painted by Hals in the early thirties, the rough brush strokes are more similar to his work in the sixties. Possibly, the man with the jug and Guldewagen himself are the same:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In an old genre painting of [[Haarlem]] from the 1650s, a man is transporting beer jugs with a horse-drawn sled. The jugs have a red deer on them, the symbol of Guldewagen's brewery:&lt;ref&gt;Research on catalog nr. 67 "Cornelis Guldewagen", by C.A. van Hees for ''Frans Hals'', Exhibition catalog, 1962 for the Frans Hals Museum, title : Exhibition on the Occasion of the Centenary of the Municipal Museum at Haarlem, 1862-1962, exhibition committee: H.P.

==Development==
Wilkinson was interviewed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' during production. He stated that he was making a documentary for cinematic release rather than TV broadcast because "I would be forced to put the leavers’ side as well. That's not what the film is about.

'''''Queloides''''' is an ongoing cultural and curatorial project in [[Cuban art]] that seeks to highlight the persistence of racist stereotypes and ideas of racial difference in Cuban society and culture. Initiated in 1997 by artist Alexis Esquivel and by art critic Omar Pascual Castillo, who organized the exhibit ''Queloides I Parte'', the project was later led by the late art critic Ariel Ribeaux Diago, who organized two important additional exhibits: ''Ni músicos ni deportistas'' (“Neither musicians nor athletes,” 1997), for which he wrote an award-winning essay, and ''Queloides'' (1999). Queloides or [[keloids]] are raised scars that, many in Cuban believe, appear most frequently on the black skin. The title makes reference to the scars of [[racism]], on the one hand, and to persistent popular beliefs that there are "natural" differences between whites and blacks.

The main purpose of these exhibits was to initiate a public conversation around topics that had been [[taboo]] in Cuban public spaces for decades. As Alexis Esquivel (2005) explained, “I, as well as other colleagues had many questions and concerns about racial prejudice in Cuba, and I was convinced that through art we could express a valuable and instructive point of view... In Queloides we paid attention to… a non-romanticized vision of the daily existence of Cuban blacks… The artists focused on the black person as a marginalized individual faced with economic disadvantages, traumas, and self reflection.”&lt;ref&gt;Alexis Esquivel, “Queloide, la cicatriz dormida (Keloid, the Dormant Scar),” in Judith Bettelheim, ''Afrocuba Works on Paper 1968–2003''. San Francisco: San Francisco State University, 2005, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Although these were groundbreaking cultural events that addressed issues of race and discrimination in Cuban society, they received very little coverage in the Cuban press and were quickly forgotten. In 2010 historian Alejandro de la Fuente and artist Elio Rodríguez Valdés organized a new edition of the exhibit, titled ''[http://www.queloides-exhibit.com Queloides: Race and Racism in Cuban Contemporary Art]''. This exhibit opened at the Centro [[Wifredo Lam]] in [[Havana]] in April 2010 and was later presented at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140829010840/http://www.mattress.org/index.cfm?event=ShowExhibition&amp;eid=96 Mattress Factory Museum] in Pittsburgh, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130208154759/http://the8thfloor.org/2011/02/queloides/ The 8th Floor Gallery] in New York City, and the Neil L. and Angelica Zander [https://web.archive.org/web/20120722014727/http://dubois.fas.harvard.edu/spring-2012-queloides-race-and-racism-cuban-contemporary-art Rudenstine Gallery] at the [[W.E.B. Du Bois Institute]] for [[African American]] Research at [[Harvard University]]. The Cuban media ignored the exhibit again, but Queloides received widespread press coverage outside Cuba, including favorable reviews in leading art journals such as ''[http://www.artnews.com/2011/04/01/cuban-art-on-the-move/ ArtNews]'', ''[http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-opinion/news/2010-10-25/us-welcomes-cuban-artists/ Art in America]'', ''[http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=43776&amp;int_modo=2#.UUkEKBzrxBw ArtDaily]'' and ''[http://www.artnexus.com/Notice_View.aspx?DocumentID=22787 ArtNexus]''. The ''Pittsburgh Post-Gazette'' called it "a ground-breaking exhibition"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cuban art exhibit at Mattress Factory winning accolades|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/art-architecture/cuban-art-exhibit-at-mattress-factory-winning-accolades-285302/|accessdate=April 5, 2013|newspaper=Pittsburgh Gazette|date=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and listed it as number four in the " year's best art"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/art-architecture/mary-thomas-weighs-in-on-the-years-best-art-279292/&lt;/ref&gt; in the city in 2010. In 2011 the important Cuban journal ''Artecubano'' published its own review of ''Queloides''.

Referring to ''Queloides: Race and Racism in Cuban Contemporary Art'', literary scholar Ana Belén Martín-Sevillano (2011) has written: "The impact of the ''Queloides'' sequence in the cultural field has made the term synonymous with the racial debate in Cuba. Designed with a comprehensive and inclusive view, one of the exhibit's major achievements has been to include representative artwork that covers the diverse array of techniques and strategies used in contemporary Cuban art to address the complexity of the cultural and social processes of [[racialization]]. Furthermore, the 2010 ''Queloides'' exhibit included the work of three women artists who had not participated in the previous shows: [[Belkis Ayón]], [[Maria Magdalena Campos Pons]], and [[Marta María Pérez Bravo]]. The work of these artist offers a compelling approach to issues of race and gender."&lt;ref&gt;Ana Belén Martín-Sevillano,"Crisscrossing Gender, Ethnicity and Race: African Religious Legacy in Cuban Contemporary's Women's Art," ''Cuban Studies'' 42 (2011), p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1580">'''Resinoids''' are [[extract]]s of [[resin]]ous plant exudates ([[balsam]]s, [[oleo gum resin]]s, and natural [[oleoresin]]s).

== Production ==
Resinous plant exudates ([[balsam]]s, [[oleo gum resin]]s, and natural [[oleoresin]]s) and animal secretions ([[ambergris]], [[castoreum]], [[musk]], and [[Civet (perfumery)|civet]]) are extracted with solvents such as [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[toluene]], or [[acetone]]. Yields range from 50 to 95&amp;nbsp;%. The products mainly consist of nonvolatile, resinous compounds. They are usually highly viscous and are sometimes diluted (e.g., with [[phthalates]] or [[benzyl benzoate]]) to improve their flow and processing properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Karl-Georg Fahlbusch | contribution=Flavors and Fragrances | title=[[Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry]] | edition=7th | publisher=Wiley | year=2007 | page=83|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Resinoids are mainly used as [[Fixative (perfumery)|perfume fixatives]].

== Oleoresins ==
The resinoids described above should be distinguished from prepared [[oleoresin]]s (e.g., [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[ginger]], [[vanilla]] oleoresins), which are concentrates prepared from spices by solvent extraction. The solvent that is used depends on the spice; currently, these products are often obtained by extraction with supercritical [[carbon dioxide]]. Pepper and ginger oleoresins contain not only volatile aroma compounds, but also substances responsible for pungency.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2840">'''Rita Boley Bolaffio''' ([[Trieste]], Italy, 7 June 1898 - [[New York City]], United States, 20 May 1995) was an [[artist]] who was instrumental in reintroducing [[collage]] and [[decoupage]] into the United States. She created powerful artwork that underscored the importance of grace and imagination.

==Early years==
Rita was born Margherita Luzzatto to Angelo Luzzatto and Olga Senigaglia in [[Trieste]], Italy.

Her family moved to [[Vienna]], where she passed [[World War I]]. She studied [[art]] under [[Josef Hoffmann]] at the [[Kunstgewerbeschule]] and did [[textile]] designs for the renowned [[Wiener Werkstaette]] under the name Grete Luzzatto. She also studied [[violin]] under the famous violinist [[František Ondříček]].

In 1919 she married Oscar Bolaffio, an architect and engineer, and cousin of painter [[Vittorio Bolaffio]]. They moved to [[Milan]] in 1928, where Rita became one of the first horsewomen in Italy, riding [[sidesaddle]], and won the "Premio Ciglione della Malpensa" (the Ciglione della Malpensa Prize) in 1936.

==American career==
[[Image:Ritaboley2.gif|thumb|right|200px|''Machine for Writing Poetry'', circa 1955]]
[[Image:Ritaboley4.gif|thumb|left|200px|''Arabesque'', circa 1963]]

In 1939, the [[Fascist]] anti-[[Jewish]] policies forced the family to flee to [[United States|America]]. She began a career as an [[artist]], specializing in imaginative [[collages]] that were displayed in the windows of most major department stores in America, including [[Lord &amp; Taylor]], [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], [[Bergdorf Goodman]], [[Neiman Marcus]], [[Carson Pirie Scott]], and many more, as well as many private commissions. She regularly contributed covers for such magazines as [[Harper's Bazaar]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], [[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Town &amp; Country]], [[Good Housekeeping]], and [[Woman's Day]].

She had many awards and one-woman exhibitions at [[museums]] and [[art museum|galleries]] (e.g. [[James Pendleton Gallery]] in [[New York City]], [[J.L. Hudson Gallery]], [[Detroit]], [[Guild Hall Museum]], [[East Hampton (town), New York|East Hampton]], N.Y. and the [[Columbia Museum of Art]] in [[South Carolina]]). Her work was showcased in the [[New York Times]], as well as European reference works on [[modern art]].

She received the [[Premio di Sorrento]] 1965 for her poem "Nell'afa".

[[File:Fauteuil racine Chine Quianlong musee arts asiatiques Nice.jpg|thumbnail|Chinese armchair made from roots. [[Qing dynasty]], [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong era]], 18th century]]
'''Root carving''' is a traditional [[Chinese art]] form. It consists of carving and polishing tree [[root]]s into various artistic creations.

==History==
Using roots to make necessities has been practiced since primitive society. Like other artistic crafts, art of roots produced from primitive labor. The earliest root carvings are “辟邪” and “角形器” showing up in the [[Warring States period]].

In the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, root carving works not only prevailed in folk, but they were also cherished by the governing class. In the Tang dynasty, people laid emphasis on the natural forms of roots, cleverly taking advantage of the effect of corrosion and moth-eaten.

In the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasties, art of root carving not only developed in the court and folk, but also appeared in grottoes and temples. Roots were used to carve the statues of the [[Buddha]], always comparing favorably with the clay.

==Features==
[[File:Root carving in Haikou - 06.JPG|thumb|150px|A craftsman works on a piece in [[Haikou]] City, [[Hainan]] Province. His shop is located in an area beside East Lake, part of [[Haikou People's Park]]. The area contains dozens of small shops dedicated to producing root carvings.]]

Root carving preserves natural beauty.{{or-inline|date=December 2017}} Ancient artists created lifelike and vivid works by a special technique using expression based on the roots' natural forms. This kind of creation is not completely artificial, but created by both human beings and nature.

Root carving is different from [[engraving]]. It combines peculiarity with ingeniousness. Although its aesthetic principals share common ground with engraving, at the same time they are applied uniquely. The common ground is that they share expressive techniques of [[wood carving]], [[sculpture]], [[stone carving]] and so on, overcoming weaknesses by acquiring others strong points. The difference lies in the natural shape of roots. During the creative process, root carving mostly maintains the natural form of the root, adding some artificial polishing. In other words, root carving is guided by the inherent qualities of the root, rather than by shaping images merely through carving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.genpen.com/genyi/jieshao/9661.html |title=根雕艺术的特点 |publisher=News.genpen.com |date=2010-03-07 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gzzhuhai.com/news-22.aspx |title=根雕艺术发展史 |publisher=Gzzhuhai.com |date=2011-06-23 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Necessities==
{{peacock|date=May 2015}}
Creative effect achieved from the same material can vary from artist to artist. Within the field three factors are considered of major importance.

*Uniqueness of the root - To some degree, root carving is an act of discovery. Finding and working with a unique root is half of the task and requires experience and a keen aesthetic vision.{{or-inline|date=December 2017}}

*Cultural foundation - Rich cultural foundation, referring to the overall creative process, highlights the natural beauty of the root.{{or-inline|date=December 2017}}

*Craftsmanship - The natural beauty of roots can be realized from a fertile imagination and a high degree of composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pic.yesky.com/sucai/szwfj/shumumo/238/520738.shtml |title=根雕艺术（三）图1_树木果实_天极图片 |publisher=Pic.yesky.com |date=2010-12-05 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pic.yesky.com/sucai/szwfj/shumumo/238/520738_2.shtml |title=根雕艺术（三）图2_树木果实_天极图片 |publisher=Pic.yesky.com |date=2010-12-05 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hb.xinhuanet.com/zhuanti/200802/29/content_15455072.htm ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jkpa.net/news_show.php?nid=740l |title=用树根雕塑人生-健康平安网 |publisher=Jkpa.net |date=2010-05-11 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sh1800.net/hongmu/woodintro/960.htm |title=缅甸黄金樟树瘤 让根雕艺术焕发无穷魅力 树瘤- 红木知识、红木种类 |publisher=Sh1800.net |date=2011-08-23 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tynet.gov.cn/HXTou/gdysnljm_4/ |title=根雕艺术你了解吗 - 头头外挂网 |publisher=Tynet.gov.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ya.newssc.org/system/20110325/001211581.html |title=四川芦山第四届根雕艺术节开幕_四川新闻网-雅安频道 |publisher=Ya.newssc.org |date=2011-03-25 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sznews.zjol.com.cn/sznews/ztpd/gdysz/index.shtml |title=嵊州新闻网-中国根雕艺术精品展 |publisher=Sznews.zjol.com.cn |date= |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.craaw.com/ljrw1.htm |title=根雕艺术概述 |publisher=Craaw.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel Daniell''' (born 1775 in [[Chertsey]]; died in [[Sri Lanka]] on 16 December 1811) was an English painter of natural history and other scenes in Africa and [[Ceylon]].&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite DNB|no-icon=1|prescript=|url=https://archive.org/stream/dictionaryofnati14stepuoft#page/33/mode/1up|title=Daniell, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Daniell is perhaps best known as the appointed artist for an expedition to Africa and the renderings he did there of African animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samuel Daniell – African scenery and animals, 1804–1805|url=http://www.sil.si.edu/imagegalaxy/imagegalaxy_imageDetail.cfm?id_image=10848|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Libraries|work=Galaxy of Images}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December, 1799, he went to [[South Africa]] for the first time.&lt;ref name="WDL"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/4323/ |title = Sketches Representing the Native Tribes, Animals, and Scenery of Southern Africa: From Drawings Made by the Late Mr. Samuel Daniell |website = [[World Digital Library]] |year = 1820 |accessdate = 2013-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings he made in southern Africa including a journey to [[Bechuanaland]] were published by his brother [[William Daniell]] in London.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; During the trip to Bechuanaland he was named the official secretary and artist for the trip. The trip went from [[Cape of Good Hope]] to Bechuanaland.&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt; He returned to England from the trip and co-published with [[William Daniell]] and [[Thomas Daniell]], ''African Scenery and Animals,'' in 1804.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;

He later on lived in [[Sri Lanka]], then called [[Ceylon]], from 1806 to his death from [[tropical fever]].&lt;ref name="WDL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5y42AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22Samuel+Daniell&amp;as_brr=3 Catalogue of drawings by British artists and artists of foreign origin, pg 17]&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve of his drawings also were published by his brother in 1806 with the title: ''A Picturesque Illustration of the Scenery, Animals and Native Inhabitants of Ceylon''.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

After Samuel Daniell's death, further engravings based on his drawings were published: In 1820, forty-eight [[lithograph]]s titled ''Sketches Representing the Native Tribes and Scenery of Southern Africa'', and in 1832, ''Twenty Varied Subjects of the Tribe of Antelopes''.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

Starting in May 2017, a sequel miniseries, '''''Saucer State''''', began publication at [[IDW Publishing|IDW]]. ''Saucer State'' lasted for six issues, and will have a six issue follow-up miniseries that will serve as a conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbr.com/saucer-state-paul-cornell-interview-saucer-country-return/ Politics Not Weird Enough? Saucer State Pits the President vs. Aliens]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The main plot of ''Saucer Country'' is about Arcadia Alvarado, the [[Hispanic]] governor of [[New Mexico]]  now running for presidency. Arcadia believes that she had been abducted by aliens one night, and embarks on a mission to get to the bottom of the mystery while running for the position of President at the same time.&lt;ref name="newsarama1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McMillan|first=Graeme|title=Development Deal: Saucer Country|url=http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2012/11/24/development-deal-saucer-country/|publisher=Spinoff Online|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Describing the series on his website, Cornell wrote-&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cornell|first=Paul|title=Saucer Country|url=http://www.paulcornell.com/2011/10/saucer-country.html|publisher=PaulCornell.com|accessdate=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|text=Saucer Country is a trip through UFO mythology, a subject I've always been fascinated with. It's a dark, suspenseful, serious thriller with, I hope, some warm, very human characters at the heart of it.}}

The series also features short stand-alone stories besides the main plot. These stories are "true stories"- accounts of people who claim to have been abducted by aliens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Vaneta|title=Presidential Election Meets Sci-Fi in SAUCER COUNTRY|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/paul-cornell-saucer-country-election.html|publisher=Newsarama.com|accessdate=6 November 2012|quote="The comic also includes accounts of "true stories" about people who claim to have been abducted by aliens, as Saucer Country examines the mythology surrounding UFOs in both the real world and its fictional one."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Arcadia Alvarado functions as the governor of New Mexico and is considered to be the primary [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate for the position of the President of the United States. Arcadia is caught in the middle of a volatile political situation as she is running for Presidency and dealing with her duties as governor at the same time. Arcadia also has to deal with her alcoholic ex-husband Michael. However, Arcadia claims to have been "abducted by aliens" one night, but only retains glimpses of her encounter with the extraterrestrial beings and does not remember the entire story. Thus, with the help of her fellow workers and staff, Arcadia tries to solve the mystery about her apparent abduction by the aliens. A former Harvard professor, Professor Kidd, is also keen on getting to the bottom of Arcadia's claim.&lt;ref name="newsarama1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bookreporter1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Saucer Country|url=http://www.bookreporter.com/reviews/saucer-country|publisher=Bookreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
* '''Governor Arcadia Alvarado''': Arcadia is the main character of the series. She is the governor of New Mexico and is of Mexican-American heritage. She is the one who claims to have been abducted by aliens, but is not able to fully justify it due to her not retaining the complete story. She has a determined and focused personality.&lt;ref name="newsarama1" /&gt;
* '''Professor Kidd''': Professor Kidd is a former Harvard professor and has a deep interest in UFO mythology, even though he carries a skeptical approach towards it. He has strange encounters with a mysterious couple who provide him with advice and instructions occasionally.&lt;ref name="newsarama1" /&gt;
* '''Michael''': Michael is Arcadia's ex-husband. Michael is addicted to alcohol&lt;ref name="bookreporter1" /&gt; and lacks the heroism Arcadia usually displays. He is present in the car the night Arcadia claims to have been abducted.&lt;ref name="newsarama1" /&gt;

==Reception==
The series received generally positive reviews. James Hunt of Comic Book Resources commented on the first issue, noting "Doubtlessly, "Saucer Country's" success is due to the combined and prodigious talents of Cornell and Kelly. " but also criticized the issue for ending too quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunt|first=James|title=Review: Saucer Country #1|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=user_review&amp;id=4548|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geeks of Doom described it as "what’s sure to become a beloved classic comic book series and that one day we will look back on this first issue in wonderment and think 'I can’t believe all that’s happened since then"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saucer Country #1|url=http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/03/14/comic-review-saucer-country-1/|publisher=Geeks of Doom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comics reviewer and writer Joey Esposito of IGN have the first issue an 8 out of a possible 10, and summarised- "Out of the gate, Saucer Country looks to be another solid entry worthy of the pedigree of Vertigo Comics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Esposito|first=Joey|title=Saucer Country #1 Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/15/saucer-country-1-review|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also pointed out that writer Paul Cornell focuses too much attention on Arcadia and "bizarre elements" and in doing so "ultimately subtracts from the grounded base that is established here."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Esposito|first=Joey|title=Saucer Country #1 Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/15/saucer-country-1-review|publisher=IGN|accessdate=14 March 2012| quote=" Because this issue focuses so intently on Arcadia, the brief two-page scene that leads us across the US to Harvard feels a bit out of place. While it clearly sets up another major player in the series to come, his role falls firmly in the more bizarre elements that will come to play a role but ultimately subtracts from the grounded base that is established here."}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also praised Ryan Kelly's art, especially his characters' body language and expressions, but criticized the colouring of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Esposito|first=Joey|title=Saucer Country #1 Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/15/saucer-country-1-review|publisher=IGN|accessdate=14 March 2012| quote="Kelly's figures are incredibly strong, accurately structured, and varied in design, offering solid body language and emotion that sells every scene, no matter the tone. However, one fairly major gripe with the art on this book is the coloring, which often muddies the texture of Kelly's inks as well as flattens the depth of the backgrounds."}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series was cancelled after 14 issues.

The first volume was nominated for the 2013 [[Hugo Award for Best Graphic Story]], but lost to the first volume of ''[[Saga (comic book)|Saga]]''.

'''''Still Life with Head-Shaped Vase and Japanese Woodcut''''' is an 1889 [[still life]] painting by French artist, [[Paul Gauguin]]. It is currently in the collection of the [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~museum/armory/galleryR/gauguin.176.html | title=Paul Gauguin | accessdate=6 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1888 and 1889 [[Paul Gauguin|Gauguin's]] enthusiasm for Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] [[woodcut]]s emerged. Japanese prints appeared in the background of his ''Apple and Vase'' painting, his portrait of ''The [[Émile Schuffenecker|Schuffenecker]] Family'' and also ''Still Life with Head-Shaped Vase and Japanese Woodcut'', which depicts an ukiyo-e portrait of an actor.{{sfn | Ives | 1980 | p=96}}

The painting was formerly owned by [[Josef Rosensaft]], a [[Holocaust]] survivor who led the community of Jewish displaced persons, who died in September 1975. He left a formidable art collection that had to be sold to settle debts related to the acquisition of the art and by some accounts an extravagant lifestyle. The 1976 sale arranged by Sotheby’s was bought in its entirety by the [[Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art]], where it all remains today and is one of the oldest paintings in the museum's collection.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-tehran-museum-of-contemporary-art/ "Iran Has Been Hiding One of the World’s Great Collections of Modern Art"]. ''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''. Retrieved December 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This sale set a record for '''Still Life with Japanese Woodcut''' at $1.4 million, and the work is currently valued at $45 million.&lt;ref name="Bloomberg" /&gt;

During the direction of [[Mahmoud Shalouithe]], the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and the [[Tate Modern]] in [[London]] tried to borrow the painting but the requests were rejected.{{sfn | موسوی | 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5103">'''Sturgeon's revelation''' (as originally expounded by [[Theodore Sturgeon]]), commonly referred to as '''Sturgeon's law''', is an [[adage]] commonly cited as "ninety percent of everything is crap". It is derived from quotations by Sturgeon, an American [[science fiction author]] and critic; while Sturgeon coined another adage that he termed "Sturgeon's law", it is the "ninety percent crap" remark that is usually referred to by that term.

The phrase was derived from Sturgeon's observation that while science fiction was often derided for its low quality by critics, the majority of examples of [[artistic work|works]] in other fields could equally be seen to be of low quality, and that science fiction was thus no different in that regard from other art forms.

== History ==
A similar adage appears in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Light that Failed]]'', published in 1890. "Four-fifths of everybody's work must be bad. But the remnant is worth the trouble for its own sake."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Writings in Prose and Verse of Rudyard Kipling|author=Rudyard, K.|isbn=9785874724696|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kRELAwAAQBAJ|accessdate=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first written reference to the adage appears in the March 1958 issue of ''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine|Venture]]'', where Sturgeon wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I repeat Sturgeon's Revelation, which was wrung out of me after twenty years of wearying defense of science fiction against attacks of people who used the worst examples of the field for ammunition, and whose conclusion was that ninety percent of SF is crud. Using the same standards that categorize 90% of science fiction as trash, crud, or crap, it can be argued that 90% of film, literature, consumer goods, etc. is crap. In other words, the claim (or fact) that 90% of science fiction is crap is ultimately uninformative, because science fiction conforms to the same trends of quality as all other artforms.&lt;ref name="venture" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Philip Klass ([[William Tenn]]), Sturgeon made this remark circa 1951, at a talk at [[New York University]] attended by Tenn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/328 |title=&amp;#39;SF Citations for OED&amp;#39; |publisher=Jessesword.com |date=6 July 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310213832/http://www.jessesword.com/sf/view/328 |archivedate=10 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was subsequently included in a talk Sturgeon gave at a 1953 [[Labor Day]] weekend  session of the [[World Science Fiction Convention]] in [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/misc/slaw.html|title=James Gunn, 'Addendum: Sturgeon's Law' |publisher=Physics.emory.edu |date= |accessdate=6 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] championed Sturgeon's law as one of his seven tools for critical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.openculture.com/2013/05/philosopher_daniel_dennett_presents_seven_tools_for_critical_thinking.html |title=Daniel Dennett Presents Seven Tools For Critical Thinking&amp;#39; |date=21 May 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "90% of everything is crap.  That is true, whether you are talking about physics, chemistry, evolutionary psychology, sociology, medicine—you name it—rock music, country western.  90% of everything is crap."  Its re-introduction to a modern audience received a positive reception, according to Dennett.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pointofinquiry.org/daniel_dennett_tools_for_thinking/ |title=Point of Inquiry | quote=Audio segment starting at minute 39|date=10 June 2013 |accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The original Sturgeon's law ==
Sturgeon had originally deemed Sturgeon's law to mean that "nothing is always absolutely so" in the story "The Claustrophile" in a 1956 issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"The Claustrophile", ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'' August 1956&lt;/ref&gt; The second adage, variously rendered as "ninety percent of everything is crud" or "ninety percent of everything is crap", was originally known as "Sturgeon's Revelation", formulated as such in his book review column for ''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine|Venture]]''&lt;ref name="venture"&gt;''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine|Venture]]'' 49, September 1957&lt;/ref&gt; in 1957. However, almost all modern uses of the term Sturgeon's law actually refer to the second, including the definition listed in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9431">'''Technology transfer''', also called '''transfer of technology''' ('''TOT'''), is the process of transferring (disseminating) [[technology]] from the places and [[ingroups and outgroups|ingroups]] of its origination to wider distribution among more people and places. It occurs along various axes: among [[universities]], from universities to businesses, from large businesses to smaller ones, from [[government]]s to businesses, across [[border]]s, both formally and informally, and both openly and surreptitiously. Often it occurs by concerted effort to share skills, knowledge, technologies, methods of manufacturing, samples of manufacturing, and facilities among [[government]]s or [[University|universities]] and other institutions to ensure that scientific and technological developments are accessible to a wider range of users who can then further develop and exploit the technology into new products, processes, applications, materials, or services. It is closely related to (and may arguably be considered a subset of) [[knowledge transfer]]. Horizontal transfer is the movement of technologies from one area to another. At present{{when|date=July 2014}} transfer of technology (TOT) is primarily horizontal. Vertical transfer occurs when technologies are moved from applied research centers to research and development departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grosse|first=Robert|title=international Technology Transfer in Services|journal=Journal of International Business Studies|date=1996|volume=27|page=782|jstor=155512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology transfer is promoted at conferences organized by such groups as the [[Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation]] and the Association of University Technology Managers, and at "challenge" competitions by organizations such as the [[Center for Advancing Innovation]] in Maryland. Local venture capital organizations such as the Mid-Atlantic Venture Association (MAVA) also sponsor conferences at which  investors assess the potential for commercialization of technology.

[[Technology brokering|Technology brokers]] are people who discovered how to bridge the emergent worlds and apply scientific concepts or processes to new situations or circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Hargadon, Andrew. [http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/3613.html ''Harvard Business School Working Knowledge for Business Leaders''], August 4, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  A related term, used almost synonymously, is "technology [[valorisation]]". While conceptually the practice has been utilized for many years (in ancient times, [[Archimedes]] was notable for applying science to practical problems), the present-day volume of research, combined with high-profile failures at [[Xerox PARC]] and elsewhere{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, has led to a focus on the process itself.

Whereas technology transfer can involve the dissemination of [[high tech|highly complex technology]] from capital-intensive origins to low-capital recipients (and can involve aspects of dependency and fragility of systems), it also can involve [[appropriate technology]], not necessarily high-tech or expensive, that is better disseminated, yielding [[robustness]] and [[autonomy|independence]] of systems.

==Transfer process==
Many companies, universities and governmental organizations now have an Office of Technology Transfer (TTO, also known as "Tech Transfer" or "TechXfer") dedicated to identifying research which has potential commercial interest and strategies for how to exploit it.  For instance, a research result may be of scientific and commercial interest, but [[patent]]s are normally only issued for practical processes, and so someone—not necessarily the researchers—must come up with a specific practical process.&lt;ref&gt;Miron-Shatz, T., Shatz, I., Becker, S., Patel, J., &amp; Eysenbach, G. (2014). [http://itamarshatz.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Promoting-Business-and-Entrepreneurial-Awareness-in-Health-Care-Professionals.pdf "Promoting business and entrepreneurial awareness in health care professionals: lessons from venture capital panels at medicine 2.0 conferences"]. Journal of Medical Internet Research, 16(8), e184.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another consideration is commercial value; for example, while there are many ways to accomplish [[nuclear fusion]], the ones of commercial value are those that generate more energy than they require to operate.

The process to commercially exploit research varies widely.  It can involve licensing agreements or setting up joint ventures and partnerships to share both the risks and rewards of bringing new technologies to market.  Other corporate vehicles, e.g. spin-outs, are used where the host organization does not have the necessary will, resources or skills to develop a new technology.  Often these approaches are associated with raising of [[venture capital]] (VC) as a means of funding the development process, a practice more common in the [[United States]] than in the [[European Union]], which has a more conservative approach to VC funding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/invest-in-research/monitoring/statistical01_en.htm EU Report on EU/global comparisons in the commercialisation of new technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Research spin-off]] companies are a popular vehicle of commercialisation in [[Canada]], where the rate of licensing of Canadian university research remains far below that of the US.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stic-csti.ca/eic/site/stic-csti.nsf/eng/h_00011.html State of The Nation 2008 - Canada's Science, Technology and Innovation System]&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology transfer offices may work on behalf of research institutions, governments and even large multinationals.  Where start-ups and spin-outs are the clients, commercial fees are sometimes waived in lieu of an equity stake in the business.  As a result of the potential complexity of the technology transfer process, technology transfer organizations are often multidisciplinary, including economists, engineers, lawyers, marketers and scientists. The dynamics of the technology transfer process has attracted attention in its own right, and there are several dedicated societies and journals.

There has been a marked increase in technology transfer intermediaries specialized in their field since 1980, stimulated in large part by the [[Bayh-Dole Act]] and equivalent legislation in other countries, which provided additional incentives for research exploitation.

== Drawbacks ==

Despite incentives to move research into production, the practical aspects are sometimes difficult to perform in practice.  Using DoD Technology Readiness Levels as a criterion (for example), research tends to focus on TRL (technology readiness level) 1–3 while readiness for production tends to focus on TRL 6–7 or higher.  Bridging TRL-3 to TRL-6 has proven to be difficult in some organizations.  Attempting to rush research (prototypes) into production (fully tested under diverse conditions, reliable, maintainable, etc.) tends to be more costly and time-consuming than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08467sp.pdf|title= Assessments of Selected Weapon Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first such catalogue was issued by Georg Willer in Augsburg in 1564. Several projects followed the model including the series of English Term Catalogues issued by [[John Starkey (publisher)|John Starkey]] and [[Robert Clavell]] under the title ''Mercurius Librarius, or, a catalogue of books'' from 1668 to 1711.&lt;ref&gt;''The Term Catalogues, 1668-1709, With a Number for Easter Term, 1711 A.D. A Contemporary Bibliography of English Literature in the Reigns of Charles II, James II, William and Mary, and Anne.'' Ed. by Edward Arber, vols. 1-3. London: Edward Arber, 1903/ 1905/ 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; "Term" referred to the dates of the fairs that would be held as platforms of the trade. 

The catalogues are a valuable source to researchers today, because they often give dates of the publication processes and information about working titles that were eventually dropped. The segmentation is of interest for its contemporary perspective on the market: a perspective modern literary histories no longer share.

The book trade of the German-speaking territories was for more than a century the model of all further European developments. The technological achievement of the printing press spread in Germany without the focus on a capital. Germany had cultural centre but a network of cities and territories in different affiliations. A fragmented decentralised geographical space had to be provided with books. Relatively small towns of 20.000 to 40.000 inhabitants created as early as the 1470s and 1480s the basic network of the new trade. Central fairs in [[Nördlingen]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Leipzig]] offered publishers from all over Germany, Austria and Switzerland in the course of the 16th century the option to change books they had published and thus to widen the scope of titles they could sell in their respective shops at home.

The first Term Catalogue published by [[Georg Willer]] in Augsburg in 1564 was supposed to inform his customers in Augsburg about books he had brought home from the last Frankfurt fair. Within the next two years his catalogue became an interesting platform Frankfurt traders would use to observe the market. Willer arranged to have his catalogue printed in Frankfurt where it soon turned from a retrospective into a prospective medium, into a catalogue issued to list all the books that would be offered on the upcoming fair.

His first catalogue showed a strong Latin production. Almost 73% percent of the titles he listed were published in the language of erudition. Most of the books fell into the theology sections. The four university faculties theology, law, medicine and - embracing all other subjects - philosophy set the catalogue's basic structure. Literature in the modern sense had no category of its own.

Willer's project attracted competitors, three of whom gained the power to challenge his project at the turn into the 17th century: An independent catholic platform appeared first in Mainz and then in Frankfurt. The city of Frankfurt began to promote a "privileged" imperial catalogue trying to use the catalogues as a platform of censorship. The 1590 saw, thirdly, the arrival of a new catalogue designed to serve the Frankfurt and Leipzig book fairs - published from 1594 to 1860 in Leipzig.

The Leipzig fairs won the competition in the course of the 17th century. The unified catalogue issued in Leipzig became the central platform of information about books published in the course of this competition.

== English Term Catalogues, 1668 to 1711 ==
Catalogues had their own history on the English market long before the series initiated by John Starkey in 1668.&lt;ref&gt;Growoll, ''A. Three centuries of English book trade bibliography''. New York, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's catalogues had served as a model of a series of continental catalogues published by [[John Bill]] between 1617 and 1628. Bill's catalogues appeared twice a year as a digest of the Frankfurt Messkatalog. Between 1622 and 1626 it included supplements designed to add the English production.&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature'' (Cambridge, 1907–21), Volume IV. Prose and Poetry: Sir Thomas North to Michael Drayton, Chapter XVIII. The Book-Trade, 1557–1625, § 26. Early Catalogues. [http://www3.bartleby.com/214/1826.html Bartleby]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The project of an independent conclusive English catalogue began, however, only in 1668 with Starkey's catalogues soon co-edited and then taken over by Robert Clavell. Clavell died on 8 August 1711. His death seems to have terminated the series. The publication had already become unstable in 1708 and 1709. A new catalogue appeared in 1711 under Clavell's mentorship after a gap of more than a year but it remained without a successor. 

The usual rhythm of editions yielded four catalogues per year with issues sold at:
* [[Hilary term|Hillary]] (February)
* [[Easter]] (May)
* [[Trinity Sunday|Trinity]] (June or July)
* [[Michaelmas]] (November or December)
The entire collection consists today of 161 catalogues. Some years have not reached the full number of four catalogues. The last catalogues printed in 1708 and 1709 were double editions covering two terms. 1670 saw two rival editions for both Easter and Trinity to mend a perceived deficiency in the official Starkey and Clavell catalogues. London's booksellers complained that their project had focused on publications that sold for more than a [[shilling (British coin)|shilling]], and that it lacked diligence. The complaint reveals that Starkey and Clavell were paid for each title they listed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Publishers of ''Mercurius Librarius,'' by their unreasonable demands for inserting the titles of Books; and also their imperfect Collecting; omitting many; and refusing all under 1sh[illing] [in] Price; hath occasioned the Printing of this Catalogue: wherein those defects are rectified.
&lt;center&gt;Collected by, and printed for, the Booksellers of ''London''.&lt;ref&gt;Easter Catalogue No.1, in ''The Term Catalogues, 1668-1709, With a Number for Easter Term, 1711 A.D.'' Ed. by Edward Arber, vols. 1. London: 1903, p.I.41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A comparison of the numbers of titles listed in the late 17th and early 18th century term catalogues and numbers the [[English Short Title Catalogue]] provides justification for these complaints.

The 161 catalogues printed between 1668 and 1711 show an increase in the number of titles. The average catalogue listed 109 books under 10 headings. Some catalogues had up to 13 headings; the minimum was six in the small catalogue that appeared for Hillary 1708. The first catalogues had begun with 40 to 50 titles; later catalogues reached 150 to 200 titles. The Easter catalogue of 1689 listed the exceptional number of 293 books.

All catalogues opened with a Divinity section and closed with a section of books reprinted. Most of the catalogues offered additional advertisements at the end to announce ongoing projects looking for subscribers and sponsors. The sequence of categories in between varied. History was most often the second heading, Miscellanies usually the one before the Reprinted section. Other prominent headings were Physick (medicine), Mathematicks (comprising Architecture and Navigation in several of the catalogues), Poetry and Plays, Musick, Navigation, Globes, Maps, Cards, Charts, Plates (in the sense of illustrations), Law, Libri Latini (&amp; François), Headings such as Architecture, Heraldry and Astrology remained rare.

None of the catalogues offered a unified section for fiction, or for literature in the modern sense. Novels were customarily listed among the "Histories"—the majority of which were non-fictional—and sometimes as "[[Miscellanies]]". The category "Poetry and Plays" was reserved for verse and stage plays.

The following table looks at all titles under the eleven most prominent headings, with a perspective on the decades and the overall trends:&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Cambridge History of the Book in Britain'' vol. 4.

A comparison with modern [[English Short Title Catalogue|ESTC]] data proves that the ''Term Catalogues'' remained highly selective. The ESTC lists between more than 13,000 and almost 23,000 titles for the individual decades. The ''Term Catalogue'' numbers range at 20%-30% of that. Catalogues of the 1690s had the greatest average numbers of titles, but ESTC data imply that the 1690s actually saw a slight drop in total title numbers. The distortions are partly the result of the project's instability in 1708 and 1709. They reflect, in part, the continuous neglect of ephemeral publications such as short political pamphlets.   

The series ended in 1708 and 1709 with double editions. The remaining catalogue for Easter 1711 began with a new number 1 issue, and remains remarkable with its attempt to establish a new structure. The long category of reprinted books was split and brought under the respective headings of the new major categories: 1)&amp;nbsp;Divinity, 2)&amp;nbsp;History &amp; Politicks, 3)&amp;nbsp;Mathematical Sciences, 4)&amp;nbsp;Physick &amp; Natural Philosophy, 5)&amp;nbsp;Philology, and 6)&amp;nbsp;Poetry. The new arrangement confirmed the position of the two categories of religious and political publications. "History and Politikcs" stresses the interest in ongoing—religio-political—debates. 1711 is still marked by the [[Henry Sacheverell|Sacheverell]] affair.&lt;ref&gt;Data again retrieved from Edward Arber's edition vol. 3, Catalogue for Easter 1711. See for the following table and a brief discussion of the data with a look at the German Messkataloge for 1711: Olaf Simons, ''Marteaus Europa oder Der Roman, bevor er Literatur wurde'' (Amsterdam/ Atlanta: Rodopi, 2001), p.36-50, 61-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Book Thief''''' is a 2013 [[World War II]] [[War film|war]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Brian Percival]] and starring [[Geoffrey Rush]], [[Emily Watson]], and [[Sophie Nélisse]]. The film is based on the [[The Book Thief|2005 novel of the same name]] by [[Markus Zusak]] and adapted by [[Michael Petroni]].

==Plot==
In February 1938, a voice representing [[Death (personification)|Death]] tells about how the young Liesel Meminger has piqued his interest. In one of the opening scenes, Liesel is traveling with her mother and younger brother on a train. On the way, her brother dies and is buried next to the tracks. Liesel steals her first book, titled ''The Grave Digger's Handbook'', when it falls out of the gravedigger's pocket. Liesel is then brought to her new home in Munich, where she meets her new foster parents Rosa Hubermann and Hans Hubermann. Rudy Steiner, a boy who lives next door, accompanies her on her first day of school. When the teacher asks Liesel to write her name on the chalkboard, she is only able to write three Xs, revealing to her classmates that she is unable to write. She is taunted by her schoolmates who chant "''dummkopf''" ("dunce") at her. One of the boys, Franz Deutscher, challenges her to read just one word to which Liesel responds by beating him up. She impresses Rudy, and they become fast friends. When Hans, her foster father, realizes that Liesel cannot read, he begins to teach her, using the book that she took from the graveside, and a giant chalkboard. Liesel becomes captivated with reading anything she can.

Liesel and Rudy become members of the [[Hitler Youth|Hitler Youth movement]]. While at a [[Nazi book burnings|Nazi book burning]] ceremony, Liesel and Rudy are harassed into throwing books onto the bonfire by Franz, but Liesel is upset to see the books being burned. When the bonfire ends and everyone leaves, Liesel is still there and she grabs a book that has been only singed. She is seen by Ilsa Hermann, wife of the [[burgermeister]] (mayor). When Rosa asks Liesel to take the laundry to the mayor's spacious, gated house, she realizes that the woman who saw her taking the book is the mayor's wife. Instead, Ilsa takes her into their library and tells Liesel she can come by anytime and read as much as she'd like. One day Liesel is found reading by the mayor who not only puts a stop to her visits but dismisses Rosa as their laundress.

During [[Kristallnacht]], Max Vandenburg and his mother, who are Jewish, are told by a friend that only one of them can escape, and Max's mother forces him to go. Max's father had saved Hans' life in World War I, and hence he goes to the Hubermanns' house where Rosa and Hans give him shelter. Max initially stays in Liesel's room while recovering from his trip, and they begin to become friends over their mutual hatred of Hitler. World War II begins, initially making most of the children in Liesel's neighborhood very happy. Max is moved to the basement so that he can move around more, but it is cold and Max becomes dangerously ill. Liesel helps Max recover by reading to him books "borrowed" from the mayor's library with every spare moment.

One day while "borrowing" a book from the mayor's home, Liesel is followed by Rudy. He discovers the secret of Max, whose name he reads on a journal Max gave to Liesel for Christmas. Rudy guesses that her family is hiding someone, and he swears to never tell anyone. Franz overhears Rudy's last words of keeping it a secret and violently pushes Rudy to reveal the secret. Rudy throws the journal into the river to keep it away from Franz. After Franz leaves, Rudy plunges into the icy river to rescue the journal, and Liesel realizes that she can truly trust him. Soon, a local party member comes by to check the Hubermanns' basement, and they have to hide Max.

While working, Hans sees a neighbor and friend named Lehman being taken away by the police because he is a Jew. Hans tries to intervene, telling the officer that Lehman is a good man, but Hans's name is taken by the soldiers and he is thrown to the ground. Hans realizes what a mistake he has made, since this has made his family visible. He tells the family, and Max realises he must leave in order to protect them. Hans then receives a telegram that he has been conscripted into the army and must leave immediately.

On the way home from school, Liesel believes she has seen Max in a line of Jews being forcibly marched through town, and she begins screaming his name, running through the line. She is thrown to the sidewalk twice by German soldiers and finally gives up when Rosa picks her up and takes her home.

Hans returns home after being injured, and the family is reunited only for a short time. One night the city is bombed by accident, and the air raid sirens fail to go off. Hans, Rosa, and Rudy's family are killed in the blast. Liesel was spared from the bombing because she fell asleep in the basement while writing in the journal given to her by Max. She sees her foster family on the ground, dead, she cries and hugs them.  Neighbors bring Rudy out of his house, barely alive. He begins to tell Liesel that he loves her, but he dies before he can finish the sentence. During this scene, Death is heard speaking again about how he received the souls of the dead. Liesel passes out, and one of the soldiers carries her to a stretcher. When she wakes up, she sees a book among the rubble and picks it up. She then sees the mayor and Ilsa drive up. With Ilsa being the only friend she has left, Liesel runs up to her and hugs her.

Two years later, after Germany has fallen to the Allies, Liesel is working in the tailor shop owned by Rudy's father. Max enters. Overjoyed by his survival and return, she runs to hug him. The final scene is Death speaking again about Liesel's life and her death at the age of 90, mentioning her husband, children, and grandchildren, as we look over her modern day Manhattan Upper East Side apartment with pictures of her past and a portrait of her, upon which the camera lingers. The narrator does not state whom she married but implies that she became a writer.

==Production==
A search for an actress to play the eponymous book thief, Liesel Meminger, occurred across the world. On February 4, 2013, it was announced that Canadian actress [[Sophie Nélisse]] was cast in the role and that Australian actor [[Geoffrey Rush]] and English actress [[Emily Watson]] would be playing Meminger's foster parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kit |first=Borys |title=Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson to Star in 'The Book Thief' Movie (Exclusive) |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/book-thief-movie-geoffrey-rush-418001 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |date=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Principal photography began in early March 2013 at [[Babelsberg Studio]] in [[Potsdam]]-[[Babelsberg]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Roxborough |first=Scott |title='The Book Thief' Begins Shooting in Germany |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/book-thief-begins-shooting-germany-427216 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=August 6, 2013 |date=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first trailer was released on August 21,&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|92EBSmxinus}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Bastille (band)|Bastille]] song "Haunt" as the music.

[[Markus Zusak]], Australian author of [[The Book Thief|the best-selling, award-winning book on which the film is based]], confirmed on his blog that the film would be narrated by the character of "Death", as was the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zusakbooks.tumblr.com/post/58924637693/first-book-thief-trailer-the-girl-the-books|title=FIRST BOOK THIEF TRAILER: the Girl, the books &amp;... - THE CITY AT OUR FEET...|work=THE CITY AT OUR FEET...}}&lt;/ref&gt; After some speculation that Death might be voiced by the anonymous American actor who was used in the official trailer, it was announced that English actor [[Roger Allam]] of ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' would portray Death in the film.

==Soundtrack==
The music for the film was composed by [[John Williams]], and the soundtrack album containing the score was released by [[Sony Classical]]. The album was released in the United States on November 19, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2013/10/19/the-book-thief-soundtrack-details/|title=‘The Book Thief’ Soundtrack Details -  Film Music Reporter|work=filmmusicreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was nominated for an Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe for Best Original Score. It won Best Instrumental Album at the 57th Grammy Awards.

''The Book Thief'' marked the first time since 2005 that Williams had scored a film not directed by [[Steven Spielberg]].

==Release==
Originally scheduled for January 17, 2014, ''The Book Thief''{{-'}}s limited theatrical release was moved forward to November 8, 2013, due to the fact that it was finished ahead of schedule and in order to compete in the 2013–14 award season. It premiered at the [[Mill Valley Film Festival]] on October 3, 2013, and was screened at the Savannah Film Festival on October 29, 2013. It expanded to a wide release on November 27, 2013.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
''The Book Thief'' received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 46%, based on 134 reviews, with an average score of 5.6/10. The site's consensus states, "A bit too safe in its handling of its Nazi Germany setting, ''The Book Thief'' counters its constraints with a respectful tone and strong performances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_book_thief/|title=The Book Thief|date=November 8, 2013|work=rottentomatoes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 53 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-book-thief/|title=The Book Thief|work=Metacritic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review for the ''New Empress Magazine'', Mairéad Roche praised the film for providing a "fresher perspective on the war" through the experiences of ordinary Germans who lived through the Nazi era.&lt;ref name="nem"&gt;{{cite web|last=Roche |first=Mairéad |title=In Review: The Book Thief |work=New Empress Magazine |date=February 28, 2014 |url=http://newempressmagazine.com/2014/02/in-review-the-book-thief/ |accessdate=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the "Oscar-baiting beautiful" cinematography and John Williams's film score that contribute to the film's emotional appeal, Roche singled out the performance of young Sophie Nélisse as Liesel that "matches the well-measured and seemingly effortless efforts of both Rush and Watson".&lt;ref name="nem"/&gt; Roche concluded,
{{quote|''The Book Thief'' weaves a consistent thread of humanity through its narrative via the commonality of Death, storytelling and the concept of free will. The disturbing sight of children in Hitler Youth uniforms and Allied blanket bombing, when shown through the innocence of a child, humanises the German generation just living their lives without the hindsight of history. A blurring of vision due to tears is to be expected, but that effect is delivered with respect and dignity to the audience.&lt;ref name="nem"/&gt;}}

In his review following the [[Mill Valley Film Festival]], Dennis Harvey at ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine wrote, "Rush generously provides the movie's primary warmth and humor; Watson is pitch-perfect as a seemingly humorless scold with a well-buried soft side."&lt;ref name="variety"/&gt; Harvey also praised the film's cinematography and film score, noting that "impeccable design contributions are highlighted by Florian Ballhaus'[s] somber but handsome widescreen lensing and an excellent score by John Williams that reps his first feature work for a director other than Steven Spielberg in years."&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvey|first=Dennis|title=Film Review: ‘The Book Thief’|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/the-book-thief-review-1200694271|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=February 23, 2014|date=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review for "MSN UK", Emma Roberts gave the film 5 out of 5 stars, stating,
{{quote|With incredible acting, a gripping story and fantastic direction, ''The Book Thief'' is a heart-warming yet chilling tale, which will nestle in your mind long after the credits finish rolling.}}

Stephanie Merry of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was less impressed with the film, giving it two and half out of four stars. Merry felt that the film "has its moments of brilliance, thanks in large part to an adept cast" but that the film ultimately shows the difficulties of bringing a successful novel to the screen.&lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite web|last=Merry|first=Stephanie|title=‘Book Thief’ movie review|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/movies/book-thief-movie-review/2013/11/13/ea0f896a-47db-11e3-a196-3544a03c2351_story.html|work=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=February 23, 2014|date=November 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Robert Abele was also unimpressed, describing the film as "just another tasteful, staid Hollywoodization of terribleness, in which a catastrophic time acts as a convenient backdrop for a wishful narrative rather than the springboard for an honest one".&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Abele|first=Robert|title=Review: 'The Book Thief' robs the truth from an evil time|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/08/entertainment/la-et-mn-the-book-thief-review-20131108|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=February 23, 2014|date=November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The Critic as Artist'''" is an essay by [[Oscar Wilde]], containing the most extensive statements of his [[aesthetic philosophy]]. A dialogue in two parts, it is by far the longest one included in his collection of essays titled ''Intentions'' published in May 1891. "The Critic as Artist" is a significantly revised version of articles that first appeared in the July and September issues of ''[[Nineteenth Century (periodical)|The Nineteenth Century]]'', originally entitled "'''The True Function and Value of Criticism'''." The essay is a conversation between its leading voice Gilbert and Ernest, who suggests ideas for Gilbert to reject.

==Summary==
The essay sets to collapse the distinction between fine art and criticism cherished by artists and critics such as [[Matthew Arnold]] and [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] - only critical faculty enables any artistic creation at all, while criticism is independent of the object it criticises and not necessarily subject to it. The essay champions contemplative life to the life of action. According to Gilbert, scientific principle of heredity shows we are never less free, never have more illusions than when we try to act with some conscious aim in mind. Critical contemplation is guided by conscious aesthetic sense as well as by the soul. The soul is wiser than we are, writes Wilde, it is the concentrated racial experience revealed by the imagination. Criticism is above reason, sincerity and fairness; it is necessarily subjective. It is increasingly more to criticism than to creation that future belongs as its subject matter and the need to impose form on chaos constantly increases. It is criticism rather than emotional sympathies, abstract ethics or commercial advantages that would make us cosmopolitan and serve as the basis of peace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilde-online.info/the-critic-as-artist-page44.html The Critic as Artist]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Lane that Had No Turning, and Other Tales Concerning the People of Pontiac''''' is a collection of short stories by [[Sir Gilbert Parker, 1st Baronet|Gilbert Parker]], published in 1900 by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Page &amp; Co.]] and also that same year by [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]] in London and by the Canadian publisher George N. Morang in Toronto. The first four stories in the collection (including the title story) had been published previously in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]''. Parker dedicated the book to Canadian prime minister [[Wilfrid Laurier|Sir Wilfrid Laurier]], declaring his "sincere sympathy with French life and character, as exhibited in the democratic yet monarchial province of Quebec."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Lane that Had No Turning|last = Parker|first = Gilbert|publisher = Doubleday, Page &amp; Co.|year = 1900|isbn = |location = New York|pages = v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book served as the basis for a [[The Lane That Had No Turning|silent film of the same title]], released in 1922.

The following stories are included in the collection:
* The Lane that Had No Turning
* The Absurd Romance Of P’tite Louison
* The Little Bell Of Honour
* A Son of the Wilderness
* A Worker in Stone
* The Tragic Comedy of Annette
* The Marriage of the Miller

** By That Place Called Peradventure
** The Singing of the Bees
** There Was a Little City
** The Forge in the Valley 
The final six pieces in the collection, the so-called "Parables of a Province," are different in tone from the other stories, had not been as well received upon magazine publication, and have not always been included in later reprints of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Note on the Text and Author in The Lane that Had No Turning and Other Tales Concerning the People of Pontiac|last = Rubio|first = Jen|publisher = Rock's Mills Press|year = 2015|isbn = 978-0-9881293-7-5|location = Oakville, ON|pages = 268–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''triangle group''' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] that can be realized geometrically by sequences of [[reflection (mathematics)|reflections]] across the sides of a [[triangle]].  The triangle can be an ordinary [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] triangle, a [[Schwarz triangle|triangle on the sphere]], or a [[hyperbolic triangle]]. Each triangle group is the [[symmetry group]] of a [[tessellation|tiling]] of the [[Euclidean plane]], the [[sphere]], or the [[Hyperbolic space|hyperbolic plane]] by [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] triangles called [[Möbius triangle]]s, each one a [[fundamental domain]] for the action.

==Definition==
Let ''l'', ''m'', ''n'' be [[integer]]s greater than or equal to 2. A '''triangle group''' Δ(''l'',''m'',''n'') is a group of motions of the Euclidean plane, the two-dimensional sphere, the real projective plane, or the hyperbolic plane generated by the [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s in the sides of a [[triangle]] with angles π/''l'', π/''m'' and π/''n'' (measured in [[radian]]s). The product of the reflections in two adjacent sides is a [[rotation]] by the angle which is twice the angle between those sides, 2π/''l'', 2π/''m'' and 2π/''n''. Therefore, if the generating reflections are labeled ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and the angles between them in the cyclic order are as given above, then the following relations hold:

# &lt;math&gt; a^{2}=b^{2}=c^{2}=1 &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; (ab)^{l}=(bc)^{n}=(ca)^{m}=1. &lt;/math&gt;

It is a theorem that all other relations between ''a, b, c'' are consequences of these relations and that Δ(''l,m,n'') is a [[discrete group]] of motions of the corresponding space. Thus a triangle group is a [[reflection group]] that admits a [[group presentation]]

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta(l,m,n) = \langle a,b,c \mid a^{2} =  b^{2} = c^{2} = (ab)^{l} = (bc)^{n} = (ca)^{m} =  1 \rangle. &lt;/math&gt;

An abstract group with this presentation is a [[Coxeter group]] with three generators.

==Classification==
Given any natural numbers ''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 exactly one of the classical two-dimensional geometries (Euclidean, spherical, or hyperbolic) admits a triangle with the angles (π/l, π/m, π/n), and the space is tiled by reflections of the triangle. The sum of the angles of the triangle determines the type of the geometry by the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]]: it is Euclidean if the angle sum is exactly π, spherical if it exceeds π and hyperbolic if it is strictly smaller than π. Moreover, any two triangles with the given angles are congruent. Each triangle group determines a tiling, which is conventionally colored in two colors, so that any two adjacent tiles have opposite colors.

In terms of the numbers ''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 there are the following possibilities.

===The Euclidean case===
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{l}+\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}=1.&lt;/math&gt;

The triangle group is the infinite [[symmetry group]] of a certain [[tessellation]] (or tiling) of the Euclidean plane by triangles whose angles add up to π (or 180°). Up to permutations, the triple (''l'',&amp;nbsp;''m'',&amp;nbsp;''n'') is one of the triples (2,3,6), (2,4,4), (3,3,3). The corresponding triangle groups are instances of [[wallpaper group]]s.

|}

===The spherical case===
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{l}+\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}&gt;1.&lt;/math&gt;

The triangle group is the finite symmetry group of a tiling of a unit sphere by spherical triangles, or [[Möbius triangle]]s, whose angles add up to a number greater than π. Up to permutations, the triple (''l'',''m'',''n'') has the form (2,3,3), (2,3,4), (2,3,5), or (2,2,''n''), ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1. Spherical triangle groups can be identified with the symmetry groups of [[platonic solid|regular polyhedra]] in the three-dimensional Euclidean space: Δ(2,3,3)  corresponds to the [[tetrahedron]], Δ(2,3,4)  to both the [[cube]] and the [[octahedron]] (which have the same symmetry group), Δ(2,3,5) to both the [[dodecahedron]] and the [[icosahedron]]. The groups Δ(2,2,''n''),  ''n''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 of [[dihedral symmetry]] can be interpreted as the symmetry groups of the family of [[dihedra]], which are degenerate solids formed by two identical [[regular polygon|regular ''n''-gons]] joined together, or dually [[hosohedra]], which are formed by joining ''n'' [[digon]]s together at two vertices.

The [[spherical tiling]] corresponding to a regular polyhedron is obtained by forming the [[barycentric subdivision]] of the polyhedron and projecting the resulting points and lines onto the circumscribed sphere. In the case of the tetrahedron, there are four faces and each face is an equilateral triangle that is subdivided into 6 smaller pieces by the medians intersecting in the center. The resulting tesselation has 4 × 6=24 spherical triangles (it is the spherical [[disdyakis cube]]).

These groups are finite, which corresponds to the compactness of the sphere – areas of discs in the sphere initially grow in terms of radius, but eventually cover the entire sphere.

The triangular tilings are depicted below:

|}

Spherical tilings corresponding to the octahedron and the icosahedron and dihedral spherical tilings with even ''n'' are [[central symmetry|centrally symmetric]]. Hence each of them determines a tiling of the real projective plane, an '''[[elliptic tiling]]'''. Its symmetry group is the quotient of the spherical triangle group by the [[reflection through the origin]] (-''I''), which is a central element of order 2. Since the projective plane is a model of [[elliptic geometry]], such groups are called ''elliptic'' triangle groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Magnus|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The hyperbolic case===
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{l}+\frac{1}{m}+\frac{1}{n}&lt;1.&lt;/math&gt;

The triangle group is the infinite symmetry group of a [[Uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane|tiling of the hyperbolic plane]] by hyperbolic triangles whose angles add up to a number less than π. All triples not already listed represent tilings of the hyperbolic plane. For example, the triple (2,3,7) produces the [[(2,3,7) triangle group]]. There are infinitely many such groups; the tilings associated with some small values:

Hyperbolic triangle groups are examples of [[non-Euclidean crystallographic group]] and have been generalized in the theory of [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Gromov]] [[hyperbolic group]]s.

== Von Dyck groups ==
Denote by ''D''(''l'',''m'',''n'') the [[subgroup]] of [[Index of a subgroup|index]] 2 in ''Δ(l,m,n)'' generated by words of even length in the generators. Such subgroups are sometimes referred to as "ordinary" triangle groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Gross |Tucker |2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''von Dyck groups''', after [[Walther von Dyck]]. For spherical, Euclidean, and hyperbolic triangles, these correspond to the elements of the group that preserve the [[Orientation (vector space)|orientation]] of the triangle – the group of rotations. For projective (elliptic) triangles, they cannot be so interpreted, as the projective plane is non-orientable, so there is no notion of "orientation-preserving". The reflections are however ''locally'' orientation-reversing (and every manifold is locally orientable, because locally Euclidean): they fix a line and at each point in the line are a reflection across the line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Magnus|1974|loc=p. 65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group ''D''(''l'',''m'',''n'') is defined by the following presentation:
:&lt;math&gt;D(l,m,n)=\langle x,y \mid x^l,y^m,(xy)^n\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;
In terms of the generators above, these are ''x = ab, y = ca, yx = cb''. Geometrically, the three elements ''x'', ''y'', ''xy'' correspond to rotations by 2π/''l'', 2π/''m'' and 2π/''n'' about the three vertices of the triangle.

Note that ''D''(''l'',''m'',''n'') ≅ ''D''(''m'',''l'',''n'') ≅ ''D''(''n'',''m'',''l''), so ''D''(''l'',''m'',''n'') is independent of the order of the ''l'',''m'',''n''.

A hyperbolic von Dyck group is a [[Fuchsian group]], a discrete group consisting of orientation-preserving isometries of the hyperbolic plane.

== Overlapping tilings ==
{{further|Schwarz triangle}}
Triangle groups preserve a tiling by triangles, namely a [[fundamental domain]] for the action (the triangle defined by the lines of reflection), called a [[Möbius triangle]], and are given by a triple of ''integers,'' (''l'',''m'',''n''), – integers correspond to (2''l'',2''m'',2''n'') triangles coming together at a vertex. There are also tilings by overlapping triangles, which correspond to [[Schwarz triangle]]s with ''rational'' numbers (''l''/''a'',''m''/''b'',''n''/''c''), where the denominators are [[coprime]] to the numerators. This corresponds to edges meeting at angles of ''a''π/''l'' (resp.), which corresponds to a rotation of 2''a''π/''l'' (resp.), which has order ''l'' and is thus identical as an abstract group element, but distinct when represented by a reflection.

For example, the Schwarz triangle (2 3 3) yields a [[density (polytope)|density]] 1 tiling of the sphere, while the triangle (2 3/2 3) yields a density 3 tiling of the sphere, but with the same abstract group. These symmetries of overlapping tilings are not considered triangle groups.

==History==
Triangle groups date at least to the presentation of the [[icosahedral group]] as the (rotational) (2,3,5) triangle group by [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1856, in his paper on [[icosian calculus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Triangle groups arise in [[arithmetic geometry]]. The [[modular group]] is generated by two elements, ''S'' and ''T'', subject to the relations ''S² = (ST)³ = 1'' (no relation on ''T''), is the rotational triangle group (2,3,∞) and maps onto all triangle groups (2,3,''n'') by adding the relation ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1. More generally, the [[Hecke group]] ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; is generated by two elements, ''S'' and ''T'', subject to the relations ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (''ST'')&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 (no relation on ''T''), is the rotational triangle group (2,''q'',∞), and maps onto all triangle groups (2,''q'',''n'') by adding the relation ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 the modular group is the Hecke group ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In [[Alexander Grothendieck|Grothendieck]]'s theory of [[dessins d'enfants]], a [[Belyi function]] gives rise to a tessellation of a [[Riemann surface]] by reflection domains of a triangle group.

All 26 [[sporadic group]]s are quotients of triangle groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Wilson|2001|loc = Table 2, p. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 12 are [[Hurwitz's automorphisms theorem|Hurwitz groups]] (quotients of the (2,3,7) group).

'''''{{lang|es|Voz viva de México}}''''' ("Living Voice of Mexico") is a collection of readings by authors from their own works. It has nearly one thousand audio documents by Spanish language writers and essayists, which have been recorded since 1959 and published in various formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Suman nuevos títulos a colección de "Voz viva de México"|url=http://eleconomista.com.mx/entretenimiento/2011/01/20/suman-nuevos-titulos-coleccion-voz-viva-mexico|work=El Economista|date=20 January 2011|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is produced by the Department of Literature of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|Autonomous National University of Mexico]] (UNAM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dirección de Literatura de la Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM) - Detalle de Instituciones|url = http://www.elem.mx/institucion/datos/330|work=Enciclopedia de la Literatura en México|publisher=Secretaria de Cultura|accessdate = 2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the authors represented in this collection are several winners of prestigious prizes such as the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel]], [[Miguel de Cervantes Prize|Cervantes]], and the [[Princess of Asturias Awards]] for Literature.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Las voces de grandes autores en español ya pueden escucharse en la biblioteca electrónica del Instituto Cervantes|url = http://www.cervantes.es/sobre_instituto_cervantes/prensa/2014/noticias/biblioteca-electronica-ic.htm|website = www.cervantes.es|accessdate = 2015-08-15|first = Instituto|last = Cervantes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 this collection was added to the ''Registro Memoria del Mundo de México'' (World Memorial Registry of Mexico), recognised by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Registro Memoria del Mundo Nacional  : Mexico en la memoria del mundo|url = http://www.memoriadelmundo.org.mx/?page_id=97|website = www.memoriadelmundo.org.mx|accessdate = 2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = México crece en la Memoria del Mundo|url = http://www.excelsior.com.mx/2012/08/18/nacional/854150|website = Excélsior|accessdate = 2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project began in 1959 on the initiative of Efrén del Pozo from Radio UNAM.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Voz Viva de México, las voces sin tiempo|url = http://66.7.195.211/index.html?tp=articulo&amp;id=1171&amp;ac=mostrar&amp;Itemid=300&amp;ct=414|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130801193431/http://66.7.195.211/index.html?tp=articulo&amp;id=1171&amp;ac=mostrar&amp;Itemid=300&amp;ct=414|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2013-08-01|accessdate = 2015-08-15}} &lt;/ref&gt; The first texts recorded were of Alfonso Reyes, followed by [[Jaime Torres Bodet]], [[Carlos Pellicer]], [[Martín Luis Guzmán]], [[:es:Artemio de Valle Arizpe]], [[José Gorostiza]] and [[Agustín Yáñez]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When [[Max Aub]] took over the project, he decided to subdivide it under the following headings:
* Mexican Literature (work of dead authors)
* Political Testimonies
* New Music
* Folklore
* Student Series 
* Music for the scene.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Later, the Union of Latin American Universities requested UNAM to expand the registry to include authors from the rest of Latin America. In response the collection was subdivided into "''Voz viva'' of Mexico" and "''Voz viva'' of Latin America",&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Voz viva: más títulos, nuevas voces|url = http://ns2241.dizinc.com/?tp=articulo&amp;id=2141&amp;ac=mostrar&amp;Itemid=103&amp;ct=0|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074538/http://ns2241.dizinc.com/?tp=articulo&amp;id=2141&amp;ac=mostrar&amp;Itemid=103&amp;ct=0|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2016-03-04|website = Coordinación de Difusión Cultural UNAM website|accessdate = 2015-08-15|last = Granados|first = Humberto}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter including recordings of texts by [[José Martí]], [[Rubén Darío]], [[Pablo Neruda]], and [[Julio Cortázar]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

By 2010, ''Voz viva de México'' had published 164 titles on [[Gramophone record|vinyl records]] and 170 [[compact disc]]s, many of which were remastered from the vinyl recordings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2014 UNAM signed an agreement with the [[Instituto Cervantes|Cervantes Institute]] permitting that Institute to incorporate the collection into its own archives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1496">'''Yves Apollinaire Pede''' (born 1959, in [[Abomey]]) is a Beninois Vodou artist. After being commissioned to reproduce reliefs for the [[Abomey Museum]], he made sand paintings of well-known personalities such as [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/artcollection/NavigationAction.do?idOeuvre=2763&amp;nouvelleLangue=fr|title=Yves Pede|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=24 June 2015|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gradually became oriented towards textile art, looking to Haitian and Cuban Vodou artists for inspiration. He is also noted for his large cement sculptures and bas-reliefs, and is stated to have a "special interest" in [[Kulito]], a Fon word which literally means "the one from the path of death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=African Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1TrAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=African Studies Center, University of California, Los Angeles|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=African Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1TrAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=African Studies Center, University of California, Los Angeles|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is based in [[Ouidah]], the world centre for [[Vodun art]], which has an annual festival.&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt;
