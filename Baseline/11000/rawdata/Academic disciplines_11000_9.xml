'''''An account of the lives and works of the most eminent Spanish painters, sculptors and architects''''' is a book written by the Spanish painter [[Antonio Palomino]] and dedicated to the biographies of the most eminent artists who worked in Spain during the so-called [[Siglo de Oro]], the golden age of Spanish art.

It was published for the first time in the original Spanish edition in 1724, entitled ''El parnaso español pintoresco y laureado'' and appearing as the third and last volume of Palomino's ''El museo pictorico y escala optica'', featuring also biographies of Italian artists who worked in Spain ([[Pietro Torrigiano]], [[Tiziano]], [[Sofonisba Anguissola]], [[Federico Zuccari]], [[Luca Giordano]] and many others) as well as Flemish artists ([[Antonio Moro]], [[Pieter Paul Rubens]]). The book includes the first biographies ever published of many Spanish artists, [[Diego Velázquez]] among others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/palominoa.htm|title=Palomino de Castro y Velasco, [Acisclo] Antonio|publisher=Dictionary of Art Historians|accessdate=29 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127122412/http://dictionaryofarthistorians.org/palominoa.htm|archive-date=2010-11-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Norbert, Velázquez, Taschen, Köln, 2000, p.95, (Italian edition) {{ISBN|3822864471}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was translated and published in English, French and German during the 18th century; the English translation appeared in 1739.

The book has been described as "the starting point for all students of Spanish painting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Enggas|first1=Robert|last2=Brown|first2=Jonathan|title=Italian and Spanish Art, 1600-1750: Sources and Documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JBYnVv2lKY4C&amp;lpg=PA192&amp;ots=NxmfpIbCQW&amp;dq=Palomino%20Velasquez&amp;pg=PA180#v=onepage&amp;q=Palomino&amp;f=false|year=1992|publisher=Northwestern University Press|isbn=0810110652|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Apologetics''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀπολογία}}, "speaking in defense") is the religious discipline of defending [[religious doctrine]]s through systematic [[argument]]ation and discourse.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G627 |title=ἀπολογία |work=Blue Letter Bible-Lexicon |accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01618a.htm |title=Apologetics |date= |website=The Advent |publisher= |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/apologetics |title=apologetics |date= |website=[[Merriam-Webster Dictionary]] |publisher= |accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of early Christian writers|Early Christian writers]] (c. 120–220) who defended their beliefs against [[criticism of Christianity|critics]] and recommended their [[faith]] to outsiders were called [[Christian apologists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Apologists |editor1-last=Cross |editor1-first=F.&amp;nbsp;L. |editor1-link=Frank Leslie Cross |work=The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church |location=New York |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 21st-century usage, ''apologetics'' is often identified with debates over [[religion]] and [[theology]].

==Etymology==
The term ''apologetics'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek]] word ''apologia''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the Classical Greek legal system, two key technical terms were employed: the prosecution delivered the ''kategoria'' (κατηγορία), and the defendant replied with an ''apologia''. To deliver an ''apologia'' meant making a formal speech or giving an explanation to reply and rebut the charges, as in the case of [[Socrates]]' [[Apology (Plato)|Apologia]] defense, as chronicled in [[Apology (Plato)|Plato's ''Apology'']] (the defense speech of [[Socrates]] at his trial).  This term appears in the [[Koine Greek]] of the [[New Testament]]. The [[Apostle Paul]] employs the term ''apologia'' in his trial speech to [[Porcius Festus|Festus]] and [[Agrippa I|Agrippa]] when he says "I make my defense" in [[Acts 26]]:2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/act/26/2/s_1044002|title=Acts 26:2|last=|first=|date=19 September 2016|website=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cognate]] form appears in Paul's [[Letter to the Philippians]] as he is "defending the gospel" in Philippians 1:7,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/phl/1/7/s_1104007|title=Phl 1:7|last=|first=|date=19 September 2016|website=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in "giving an answer" in 1 Peter 3:15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blueletterbible.org/kjv/1pe/3/15/s_1154015|title=1Pe 3:15|last=|first=|date=19 September 2016|website=Blue Letter Bible|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the term ''apologetics'' has Western, primarily Christian origins and is most frequently associated with the defense of Christianity, the term is sometimes used referring to the defense of any religion in formal debate involving religion.

== Apologetic positions ==

===Bahá'í===
{{main article|Bahá'í apologetics}}
Many [[Bahá'í literature#Apologia|apologetic books]] have been written in defence of the history or teachings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. The religion's founders wrote several books presenting proofs of their religion, among them are the [[Báb]]'s ''[[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Dalá'il-i-Sab'ih (The Seven Proofs)|Seven Proofs]]'' and [[Bahá'u'lláh]]'s ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]''.&lt;ref name="PSmith"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= apologetics |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |pages= 39–40 |isbn= 1-85168-184-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later Bahá'í authors wrote prominent apologetic texts, such as [[Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl]]'s ''The Brilliant Proof'' and [[Udo Schaefer]] et al.'s ''Making the Crooked Straight'';.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/cannuyer_schaefer_desinformation|title=Making the Crooked Straight, by Udo Schaefer, Nicola Towfigh, and Ulrich Gollmer|work=bahai-library.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
One of the earliest Buddhist apologetic texts is ''[[Milinda Panha|The Questions of King Milinda]]'', which deals with the Buddhist metaphysics such as the "no-self" nature of the individual and characteristics such as of wisdom, perception, volition, feeling, consciousness and the soul. In the mid-19th century, encounters between Buddhists and Christians in [[Religion in Japan|Japan]] prompted the formation of a Buddhist Propagation Society {{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. In recent times, A.&amp;nbsp;L. De Silva, an Australian convert to [[Buddhism]], has written a book, ''Beyond Belief'', providing Buddhist apologetic responses and a critique of Christian Fundamentalist doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/beyond-belief02.pdf|title=Beyond Belief, a Buddhist Critique of Fundamentalist Christianity|last=De Silva|first=A.&amp;nbsp;L.|publisher=Three Gems Publications, ebook link at Buddha Dharma Education Association Incorporated, also|year=1994|isbn=978-0-6462-1211-1|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gunapala Dharmasiri wrote an apologetic critique of the [[God in Christianity|Christian concept of God]] from a [[Theravada|Theravadan Buddhist]] perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Buddhist critique of the Christian concept of God : a critique of the concept of God in contemporary Christian theology and philosophy of religion from the point of view of early Buddhism|last=Dharmasiri|first=Gunapala|publisher=Colombo : Lake House Investments|year=1974|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=WorldCat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===

Christian apologetics combines [[Christian theology]], [[natural theology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/theo-nat/ | title=Natural Theology | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=10 March 2015 | author=Brent, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[philosophy]] to present a rational basis for the Christian faith, to defend the faith against objections and misrepresentation.

Christian apologetics has taken many forms over the centuries. In the [[Roman Empire]], Christians were severely persecuted, and many charges were brought against them. J. David Cassel&lt;ref&gt;J. David Cassel. "Defending the Cannibals: How Christians responded to the sometimes strange accusations of their critics." {{cite web|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ch/1998/issue57/57h012.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821133320/http://www.ctlibrary.com/ch/1998/issue57/57h012.html |archivedate=2011-08-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; gives several examples: [[Tacitus]] wrote that [[Nero]] fabricated charges that Christians started the [[Great Fire of Rome|burning of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, Annals XV.44&lt;/ref&gt; Other charges included [[cannibalism]] (due to a literal interpretation of the [[Eucharist]]) and [[incest]] (due to early Christians' practice of addressing each other as "brother" and "sister"). [[Saul of Tarsus]], [[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]] and others often defended Christianity against charges that were brought to justify persecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christianity.com/church/church-history/timeline/1-300/why-early-christians-were-despised-11629610.html|title=Why Early Christians Were Despised|last=|first=|date=|website=Christianity Today (Church history timeline).|publisher=|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later apologists have focused on providing reasons to accept various aspects of Christian belief. Christian apologists of many traditions, in common with Jews, Muslims, and some others, argue for the existence of a unique and personal God. [[Theodicy]] is one important aspect of such arguments, and [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s arguments have been highly influential in this area. Many prominent Christian apologists are scholarly philosophers or theologians, frequently with additional doctoral work in [[physics]], [[cosmology]], [[comparative religions]], or other fields. Others take a more popular or pastoral approach. Some prominent modern apologists are [[Douglas Groothuis]], [[Frederick Copleston]], [[John Lennox]], [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter R. Martin]], [[Dinesh D'Souza]], [[Douglas Wilson (theologian)|Douglas Wilson]], [[Cornelius Van Til]], [[Gordon Clark]], [[Francis Schaeffer]], [[Greg Bahnsen]], [[Edward John Carnell]], [[James White (theologian)|James White]], [[R.C. Sproul]], [[Hank Hanegraaff]], [[Ravi Zacharias]], [[Alister McGrath]], [[Lee Strobel]], [[Josh McDowell]], [[Peter Kreeft]], [[G. K. Chesterton]], [[C. S. Lewis]], [[William Lane Craig]], [[J. P. Moreland]], [[Hugh Ross (creationist)|Hugh Ross]], [[David Bentley Hart]], [[Gary Habermas]], [[Norman Geisler]] and [[Scott Hahn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0088.html/ Catholic Education Resource Center: ''The Scott Hahn Conversion Story''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718093548/http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0088.html/ |date=July 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable apologists within the [[Catholic Church]] include [[Robert Barron (bishop)|Bishop Robert Barron]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordonfire.org/about/fr-robert-barron/|title=Page Not Found - Word On Fire|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[G.

[[John Henry Newman]] (February 21, 1801 – August 11, 1890) was an English convert to [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], later made a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and [[beatified]] in 2010. In early life he was a major figure in the [[Oxford Movement]] to bring the [[Church of England]] back to its Catholic roots.  Eventually his studies in history persuaded him to become a Roman Catholic. When John Henry Newman entitled his spiritual autobiography ''[[Apologia Pro Vita Sua]]'' in 1864, he was playing upon both this connotation, and the more commonly understood meaning of an expression of contrition or regret.

Christian apologists employ a variety of philosophical and formal approaches, including [[Ontological argument|ontological]], [[Cosmological argument|cosmological]], and [[teleological argument]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bethinking.org/apologetics/an-introduction-to-christian-apologetics?Strongs=G627|title=An Introduction to Christian Apologetics|last=Coulter|first=Paul|date=|website=Bethinking|publisher=|access-date=21 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian presuppositionalist approach to apologetics utilizes the [[transcendental argument for the existence of God]].&lt;ref&gt;Apologetics: A Justification of Christian Belief
John Frame-Joseph Torres - P&amp;R Publishing - 2015 p. 67f&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tertullian]] was a notable early [[Christian]] apologist. He was born, lived and died in [[Carthage]]. He is sometimes known as the "Father of the [[Latin Church]]". He introduced the term ''[[Trinity]]'' ([[Latin]] ''trinitas'') to the Christian vocabulary&lt;ref&gt;''A History of Christian Thought'', [[Paul Tillich]], Touchstone Books, 1972. {{ISBN|0-671-21426-8}} (p. 43)&lt;/ref&gt; and also probably{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} the formula "three Persons, one Substance" as the Latin "tres [[Persona]]e, [[Consubstantial|una Substantia]]" (itself from the [[Koine Greek]] "treis [[Hypostasis (religion)|Hypostaseis]], [[Ousios|Homoousios]]"), and also the terms ''Vetus Testamentum'' ([[Old Testament]]) and ''Novum Testamentum'' ([[New Testament]]).

====Mormonism====
{{further information|Mormon studies#Apologetics}}
There are notable Latter-day Saint apologists who focus on the defense of [[Mormonism]], including early church leaders such as [[Parley P. Pratt]], [[John Taylor (1808-1887)|John Taylor]], [[B.&amp;nbsp;H. Roberts]], [[James E. Talmage]] and more modern figures such as [[Hugh Nibley]], [[Orson Scott Card]], and [[Jeff Lindsay (engineer)|Jeff Lindsay]].

Several well-known Mormon apologetic organizations, such as the [[Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (a group of scholars at [[Brigham Young University]]) and [[FairMormon]] (an independent, Mormon-run, not-for-profit group), have been formed to defend the doctrines and history of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] in general and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in particular.

=== Deism ===
[[Deism]] is a form of [[theism]] in which God created the universe and established rationally comprehensible moral and natural laws but no longer intervenes in human affairs. Deism is a [[natural religion]] where belief in God is based on application of reason and evidence observed in the designs and laws found in nature.&lt;sup&gt;[[Criticism of atheism#cite note-12|[12]]]&lt;/sup&gt;  The World Order of Deists maintains a web site presenting deist apologetics that demonstrate the existence of God based on evidence and reason, absent divine revelation.

===Hinduism===
Hindu apologetics began developing during the British colonial period.  A number of Indian intellectuals had become critical of the British tendency to devalue the Hindu religious tradition. As a result, these Indian intellectuals, as well as a handful of British [[Indology|Indologists]], were galvanized to examine the roots of the religion as well as to study its vast arcana and corpus in an analytical fashion. This endeavor drove the deciphering and preservation of [[Sanskrit]]. Many translations of Hindu texts were produced which made them accessible to a broader reading audience.

A range of Indian philosophers, including [[Swami Vivekananda]] and [[Aurobindo Ghose]], have written rational explanations regarding the values of the Hindu religious tradition. More modern proponents such as the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] have also tried to correlate recent developments from [[quantum physics]] and [[consciousness]] research with Hindu concepts. The late Reverend [[Pandurang Shastri Athavale]] has given a plethora of discourses regarding the symbolism and rational basis for many principles in the [[Veda|Vedic tradition]]. In his book ''The Cradle of Civilization'', David Frawley, an American who has embraced the Vedic tradition, has characterized the ancient texts of the Hindu heritage as being like "pyramids of the spirit". [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] translated over sixty volumes of classic Vedic scriptures including the biography and conclusions of the famous 16th century bhakti scholar [[Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]; many of these translations and commentaries have been further translated into as many as eighty languages, producing over half a billion books distributed throughout the world. Such individuals have tried to construct an intellectual defense of [[Hinduism]] during a phase when the [[Fundamentalism|fundamentalistic]] elements of other faiths have sought to denigrate the ancient religion in an effort to gain converts.

===Judaism===
{{See also|Jewish polemics and apologetics in the Middle Ages}}
Jewish apologetic literature can be traced back as far as [[Aristobulus of Paneas]], though some discern it in the works of [[Demetrius the chronographer]] (3rd century BCE) traces of the style of "questions" and "solutions" typical of the genre. Aristobulus was a Jewish philosopher of [[Alexandria]] and the author of an apologetic work addressed to [[Ptolemy VI Philometor]]. [[Josephus]]'s [[Contra Apion]] is a wide-ranging defense of [[Judaism]] against many charges laid against Judaism at that time, as too are some of the works of [[Philo of Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;John Granger Cook (2000) ''The Interpretation of the New Testament in Greco-Roman paganism'' p.4., Mohr Siebeck Verlag, Tuebingen, Germany&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1651-apologists|title=APOLOGISTS|work=Jewish Encyclopedia|year=1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature ==
Plato's ''Apology'' may be read as both a religious and literary apology; however, more specifically literary examples may be found in the [[preface]]s and [[dedication]]s, which proceed many [[Early modern period|Early Modern]] plays, novels, and poems. Eighteenth century authors such as [[Colley Cibber]], [[Frances Burney]], and [[William Congreve]], to name but a few, prefaced the majority of their poetic work with such apologies. In addition to the desire to defend their work, the apologetic preface often suggests the author's attempt to humble his- or herself before the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/30105/apology|title=Apology|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|work=Britannica Academic Edition|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''astrophysical maser''' is a naturally occurring source of [[Stimulated emission|stimulated]] [[spectral line]] emission, typically in the [[microwave]] portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This emission may arise in [[molecular cloud]]s, [[comet]]s, [[planet]]ary [[atmosphere]]s, [[stellar atmosphere]]s, or  various other conditions in [[interstellar space]].

==Background==
{{main|maser}}

===Discrete transition energy===
Like a [[laser]], the emission from a [[maser]] is [[Stimulated emission|stimulated]] (or ''seeded'') and monochromatic, having the [[frequency]] [[Max Planck|corresponding]] to the [[energy]] difference between two [[Quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] energy levels of the species in the gain medium which have been [[Laser pumping|pumped]] into a [[Statistical mechanics|non-thermal]] [[Population inversion|population distribution]]. However, naturally occurring masers lack the [[resonance|resonant]] [[Cavity resonator|cavity]] engineered for terrestrial laboratory masers. The emission from an astrophysical maser is due to a single pass through the gain medium and therefore generally lacks the spatial [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]] and [[Normal mode|mode]] purity expected from a laboratory maser.

===Nomenclature===
Due to the differences between engineered and naturally occurring masers, it is often stated &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/n823360t68138811/ Masers, Lasers and the Interstellar Medium], Vladimir Strelnitski 1997, Astrophysics and Space Science, vol. 252, pp. 279-287&lt;/ref&gt; that astrophysical masers are not "true" masers because they lack an oscillation cavity. The distinction between oscillator-based ''[[Laser#Terminology|laser]]s'' and single-pass ''lasers'' was intentionally disregarded by the laser community in the early years of the technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook/030908699X/html/202.html Biographical Memoirs V.83], [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This fundamental incongruency in language has resulted in the use of other paradoxical definitions in the field. For example, if the gain medium of a (misaligned) laser is emission-seeded but non-oscillating radiation, it is said to emit [[amplified spontaneous emission]] or ''ASE''. This ASE is regarded as unwanted or parasitic (some researchers would add to this definition the presence of insufficient [[feedback]] or unmet [[lasing threshold]]): that is, the users wish the system to behave as a laser. The emission from astrophysical masers is, in fact, ASE but is sometimes termed [[superradiant emission]] to differentiate it from the laboratory phenomenon. This simply adds to the confusion, since both sources are superradiant. In some laboratory lasers, such as a single pass through a [[Regenerative circuit|regeneratively]] amplified [[Ti-sapphire laser|Ti:Sapph]] stage, the physics is directly analogous to an amplified ray in an astrophysical maser.

Furthermore, the practical limits of the use of the ''m'' to stand for ''microwave'' in ''maser'' are variously employed. For example, when lasers were initially developed in the visible portion of the spectrum they were called ''optical masers.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v112/i6/p1940_1 Infrared and Optical Masers], A. L. Schawlow and C. H. Townes 1958 Physical Review 112, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Townes|Townes]] advocated that the ''m'' stand for ''molecule'' since energy states of molecules generally provide the masing transition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1964/townes-lecture.pdf C. H. Townes] [[Nobel Prize]] lecture&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, some will use the term ''laser'' to describe any system which exploits an electronic transition and the term ''maser'' to describe a system which exploits a [[Rotational transition|rotational]] or [[Vibrational transition|vibrational]] transition, regardless of the output frequency. Some [[astrophysicist]]s use the term ''iraser'' to describe a maser emitting at a [[wavelength]] of a few [[micrometre]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119074614/HTMLSTART?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 An ISO survey of possible water and hydroxyl IRASER transitions towards the star-forming regions W49, W3(OH) and Sgr B2M], M. D. Gray and J. A. Yates 1999 [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] 310, 1153&lt;/ref&gt; even though the [[optics]] community has similar sources which they call lasers. The term ''taser'' has been used to describe laboratory masers in the [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] regime&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=APPLAB000065000015001865000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes TASERs: Possible dc pumped terahertz lasers using interwell transitions in semiconductor heterostructures], A. N. Korotkov, D. V. Averin, and K. K. Likharev 1994 Applied Physics Letters 65, 1865&lt;/ref&gt; although [[astronomer]]s might call these ''sub-millimeter masers'' and laboratory [[physicist]]s generally call these ''gas lasers'' or specifically ''[[ethanol|alcohol]] lasers'' in reference to the gain species. The [[electrical engineering]] community typically limits the use of the word microwave to frequencies roughly between 1&amp;nbsp;[[GHz]] and 300&amp;nbsp;GHz, that is wavelengths between 1&amp;nbsp;mm and 33&amp;nbsp;cm.

===Astrophysical conditions===
The simple existence of a pumped population inversion is not sufficient for the observation of a maser. For example, there must be velocity coherence along the line of sight so that Doppler shifting does not prevent inverted states in different parts of the gain medium from radiatively coupling. Also, while [[Polarization (waves)|polarisation]] in laboratory lasers and masers may be achieved by selectively oscillating the desired modes, polarisation in natural masers will only arise in the presence of a polarisation-state dependent pump or of a [[magnetic field]] in the gain medium. Finally, the radiation from astrophysical masers can be quite weak and may escape detection due to the limited sensitivity (and relative remoteness) of astronomical observatories and due to the sometimes overwhelming spectral absorption from unpumped molecules of the maser species in the surrounding space. This latter obstacle may be partially surmounted through the judicious use of the spatial filtering inherent in [[interferometry|interferometric]] techniques, especially [[very long baseline interferometry]] (VLBI).

The major use of maser study is that they give valuable information on the conditions in space, such as temperature, number density, magnetic field, and velocity, in the most interesting of environments — including stellar birth and death, and the centres of galaxies containing [[black hole]]s.{{ref|11}}{{ref|12}} The conditions involved in these events still need more accurate measuring so that theoretical models can be refined or revised.

==Discovery==

===Historical background===
In 1965 an unexpected discovery was made by Weaver ''et al.'':{{ref|1}} emission lines in space, of unknown origin, at a frequency of 1665&amp;nbsp;MHz. At this time many researchers still thought that molecules could not exist in space, and so the emission was at first attributed to an unknown form of interstellar matter named ''Mysterium'', but the emission was soon identified as line emission from OH molecules in compact sources within molecular clouds.{{ref|2}} More discoveries followed, with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emission in 1969,{{ref|3}} CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH emission in 1970{{ref|5}} and SiO emission in 1974,{{ref|4}} all coming from within molecular clouds. These were termed "masers", as from their narrow line-widths and high effective temperatures it became clear that these sources were amplifying microwave radiation.

Masers were then discovered around highly evolved [[Late-type star]]s (named [[OH/IR star]]s). First was OH emission in 1968,{{ref|6}} then H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emission in 1969{{ref|7}} and SiO emission in 1974.{{ref|8}} Masers were also discovered in external galaxies in 1973,{{ref|9}} and in the [[Solar System]] in comet halos.

Another unexpected discovery was made in 1982 with the discovery of emission from an extra-galactic source with an unrivalled luminosity about 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; times larger than any previous source.{{ref|10}} This was termed a ''[[megamaser]]'' because of its great luminosity; many more megamasers have since been discovered.

A weak disk maser was discovered in 1995 emanating from the star MWC 349A, using NASA's [[Kuiper Airborne Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;Hydrogen Recombination Beta-Lines in MWC 349; C Thom, VS Strelnitski, J Martin-Pintado, HE Matthews, HA Smith; Astronomy and Astrophysics; v. 300, p.843&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for an ''anti-pumped'' ([[dasar]]) sub-thermal population in the 4830&amp;nbsp;MHz transition of formaldehyde (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO) was observed in 1969 by Palmer ''et al.''

===Detection===
The connections of maser activity with far Infra-red (FIR) emission has been used to conduct searches of the sky with optical telescopes (because optical telescopes are easier to use for searches of this kind), and likely objects are then checked in the radio spectrum. Particularly targeted are molecular clouds, OH-IR stars, and FIR active galaxies.

===Known interstellar species===
The following species have been observed in stimulated emission from astronomical environments: &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lachowicz | first=Paweł | date=16 May 2007 | title=Astrophysical masers | url=https://users.camk.edu.pl/ptz/wyklad/maser.pdf | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of maser radiation==
The amplification or ''gain'' of radiation passing through a maser cloud is exponential. This has consequences for the radiation they produce:

===Beaming===
Small path differences across the irregularly shaped maser cloud become greatly distorted by exponential gain. Part of the cloud that has a slightly longer path length than the rest will appear much brighter (as it is the exponent of the path length that is relevant), and so maser spots are typically much smaller than their parent clouds. The majority of the radiation will emerge along this line of greatest path length in a "beam"; this is termed ''beaming''.

===Rapid variability===
As the gain of a maser depends exponentially on the population inversion and the [[velocity]]-coherent path length, any variation of either will itself result in exponential change of the maser output.

===Line narrowing===
Exponential gain also amplifies the centre of the line shape ([[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] or [[Cauchy distribution|Lorentzian]], etc.) more than the edges or wings. This results in an emission line shape that is much taller but not much wider. This makes the line appear narrower relative to the unamplified line.

===Saturation===
The exponential growth in intensity of radiation passing through a maser cloud continues as long as pumping processes can maintain the population inversion against the growing losses by stimulated emission. While this is so the maser is said to be ''unsaturated''. However, after a point, the population inversion cannot be maintained any longer and the maser becomes ''saturated''. In a saturated maser, amplification of radiation depends linearly on the size of population inversion and the path length. Saturation of one transition in a maser can affect the degree of inversion in other transitions in the same maser, an effect known as ''competitive gain''.

===High brightness===
The ''[[brightness temperature]]'' of a maser is the temperature a [[black body]] would have if producing the same emission brightness at the wavelength of the maser. That is, if an object had a temperature of about 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;[[Kelvin|K]] it would produce as much 1665-MHz radiation as a strong interstellar OH maser. Of course, at 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;K the OH molecule would [[dissociate]] ([[KT (energy)|kT]] is greater than the [[covalent bond|bond]] energy), so the brightness temperature is not directly indicative of the [[temperature|kinetic temperature]] of the maser gas but is nevertheless useful in describing maser emission. Masers have huge effective temperatures, many around 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;K, but some of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;K and even 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;K.

===Polarisation===
An important aspect of maser study is [[Polarization (waves)|polarisation]] of the emission. Astronomical masers are often very highly polarised, sometimes 100% (in the case of some OH masers) in a [[Circular polarization|circular fashion]], and to a lesser degree in a [[Linear polarization|linear fashion]]. This polarisation is due to some combination of the [[Zeeman effect]], magnetic beaming of the maser radiation, and [[anisotropic]] pumping which favours certain [[magnetic quantum number|magnetic-state]] transitions.

It should be noted that many of the characteristics of [[megamaser]] emission are different.

==Maser environments==

===Comets===
[[Comet]]s are small bodies (5–15&amp;nbsp;km diameter) of frozen volatiles (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) embedded in a crusty silicate filler. They orbit the sun in eccentric orbits and as they approach the sun the volatiles vaporise to form a halo, and later a tail, around the nucleus. Once vaporised these molecules can form inversions and mase.

The impact of comet [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]] with [[Jupiter]] in 1994 resulted in maser emissions in the 22&amp;nbsp;GHz region from the water molecule.&lt;ref&gt;Cosmovici, C. B.; Montebugnoli, S.; Pogrebenko, S.; Colom, P. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1995DPS....27.2802C&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=412cca40f919078 Water MASER Detection at 22 GHz after the SL-9/Jupiter Collision], [[Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the apparent rarity of these events, observation of the intense maser emission has been suggested as a detection scheme for [[extrasolar planets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/impact2000/pdf/3002.pdf Radio Search for Extrasolar Cometary Impacts at 22 Ghz (water Maser Emission)], Catastrophic Events Conference, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultraviolet light from the sun breaks down some H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules forming OH molecules that can mase. In 1997, 1667-MHz maser emission from the OH molecule was observed from comet [[Hale-Bopp]].&lt;ref&gt;Ogley R.N., Richards A.M.S., Spencer R.E. "[http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/oldusers/rno/Research/ogley_IAJ_24_97.ps A Masing Hale-Bopp]", Irish Astr. J., 1997, 24, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planetary atmospheres===
It is predicted that masers exist in the atmospheres of gas giant planets, e.g. [http://www.atnf.csiro.au/news/newsletter/jun03/3and12mm_masers.htm]. Such masers would be highly variable due to planetary rotation (10-hour period for Jovian planets).

===Planetary systems===
In 2009, S. V. Pogrebenko et al.&lt;ref&gt;S. V. Pogrebenko et al., A&amp;A, 494, L1-L4 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; reported [http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2009/05/aa11186-08.pdf] the detection of water masers in the plumes of water associated with  the Saturnian  moons Hyperion, Titan, Enceladus, and Atlas.

===Stellar atmospheres===
[[File:Eso0725a.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Pulsations of the [[Mira variable]] [[S Orionis]], showing dust production and [[maser]]s (ESO)]]
The conditions in the atmospheres of [[late-type star]]s support the pumping of different maser species at different distances from the star.  Due to instabilities within the nuclear burning sections of the star, the star experiences periods of increased energy release.  These pulses produce a shockwave that forces the atmosphere outward.  Hydroxyl masers occur at a distance of about 1000 to 10000 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU), water masers at a distance of about 100 to 400 AU, and silicon monoxide masers at a distance of about 5 to 10 AU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vlemmings|author2=Diamond|author3=van Langevelde|author4=M Torrelles|title=The Magnetic Field in the Star-forming Region Cepheus a from Water Maser   Polarization Observations|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20054275|date=2006|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=448|issue=2|pages=597–611|arxiv=astro-ph/0510452|bibcode = 2006A&amp;A...448..597V }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both radiative and collisional pumping resulting from the shockwave have been suggested as the pumping mechanism for the silicon monoxide masers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Malcolm|year=2012|title=Maser Sources in Astrophysics|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] |pages=218–230|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These masers diminish for larger radii as the gaseous silicon monoxide condenses into dust, depleting the available maser molecules.  For the water masers, the inner and outer radii limits roughly correspond to the density limits for maser operation.  At the inner boundary, the collisions between molecules are enough to remove a population inversion.  At the outer boundary, the density and optical depth is low enough that the gain of the maser is diminished.  Additionally, the hydroxyl masers are supported chemical pumping.  At the distances where these masers are found water molecules  are disassociated by UV radiation.

===Star-forming regions===
{{main|Star formation}}
[[Young stellar objects]] and (ultra)compact [[H II region]]s embedded in [[molecular cloud]]s and [[Dark nebula|giant molecular clouds]], support the bulk of astrophysical masers. Various pumping schemes - both radiative and collisional and combinations thereof - result in the maser emission of multiple transitions of many species. For example, the OH molecule has been observed to mase at 1612, 1665, 1667, 1720, 4660, 4750, 4765, 6031, 6035, and 13441&amp;nbsp;MHz. Water and [[methanol]] masers are also typical of these environments. Relatively rare masers such as [[ammonia]] and [[formaldehyde]] may also be found in star-forming regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Fish|author2=Reid|author3=Argon|author4=Xing-Wu Zheng|title=Full-Polarization Observations of OH Masers in Massive Star-Forming   Regions: I.

===Supernova remnants===
[[Image:IC 443.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]] image of [[IC 443]], a [[supernova remnant]] with maser emission]]
The 1720&amp;nbsp;MHz maser transition of the OH molecule is known to be associated with [[supernova remnants]] that interact with [[molecular clouds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1068168 |title=Supernova Remnant OH Masers: Signposts of Cosmic Collision |date=2002 |last1=Wardle |first1=M. |journal=Science |volume=296 |issue=5577 |pages=2350–2354 |pmid=12089433 |last2=Yusef-Zadeh |first2=F|bibcode = 2002Sci...296.2350W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extragalactic sources===
While some of the masers in star forming regions can achieve luminosities sufficient for detection from external galaxies (such as the nearby [[Magellanic Clouds]]), masers observed from distant galaxies generally arise in wholly different conditions. Some galaxies possess central [[black hole]]s into which a disk of molecular material (about 0.5 [[parsec]] in size) is falling. Excitations of these molecules in the [[Active galaxy|disk]] or in a [[Relativistic jet|jet]] can result in ''[[megamaser]]s'' with large luminosities. Hydroxyl, water, and formaldehyde masers are known to exist in these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.41.011802.094927 |title=MEGA-MASERS AND GALAXIES |date=2005 |last1=Lo |first1=K.Y. |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=43 |pages=625–676|bibcode = 2005ARA&amp;A..43..625L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ongoing research==
Astronomical masers remain an active field of research in [[radio astronomy]] and laboratory astrophysics due, in part, to the fact that they are valuable diagnostic tools for astrophysical environments which may otherwise elude rigorous quantitative study and because they may facilitate the study of conditions which are inaccessible in terrestrial laboratories.

===Variability===
''Maser variability'' is generally understood to mean the change in apparent brightness to the observer. Intensity variations can occur on timescales from days to years indicating limits on maser size and excitation scheme. However, masers change in various ways over various timescales.

===Distance determinations===
Masers in star-forming regions are known to move across the sky along with the material that is flowing out from the forming star(s). Also, since the emission is a narrow spectral line, line-of-sight velocity can be determined from the [[Doppler shift]] variation of the observed frequency of the maser, permitting a three-dimensional mapping of the dynamics of the maser environment. Perhaps the most spectacular success of this technique is the dynamical determination of the distance to the galaxy [[NGC 4258]] from the analysis of the motion of the masers in the black-hole disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Herrnstein|author2=Moran|author3=Greenhill|author4=Diamond|author5=Inoue|author6=Nakai|author7=Miyoshi|author8=Henkel|author9=Riess|title=A 4% Geometric Distance to the Galaxy NGC4258 from Orbital Motions in a   Nuclear Gas Disk|doi=10.1038/22972|date=1999|journal=Nature|volume=400|issue=6744|pages=539–541|arxiv=astro-ph/9907013|bibcode = 1999Natur.400..539H }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Also, water masers have been used to estimate the distance and [[proper motion]] of galaxies in the [[Local Group]], including that of the [[Triangulum Galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/0503058|bibcode=2005Sci...307.1440B|doi=10.1126/science.1108342 |title=The Geometric Distance and Proper Motion of the Triangulum Galaxy (M33) |date=2005 |last1=Brunthaler |first1=A. |journal=Science |volume=307 |issue=5714 |pages=1440–1443 |pmid=15746420 |last2=Reid |first2=MJ |last3=Falcke |first3=H |last4=Greenhill |first4=LJ |last5=Henkel |first5=C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Very Long Baseline Interferometry|VLBI]] observations of maser sources in late type stars and star forming regions provide determinations of their [[trigonometric parallax]] and therefore their distance. This method is much more accurate than other distance determinations, and gives us information about the galactic distance scale (e.g. the distance of spiral arms).

===Open issues===
Unlike terrestrial lasers and masers for which the excitation mechanism is known and engineered, the reverse is true for astrophysical masers. In general, astrophysical masers are discovered empirically then studied further in order to develop plausible suggestions about possible pumping schemes. Quantification of the transverse size, spatial and temporal variations, and polarisation state (typically requiring VLBI telemetry) are all useful in the development of a pump theory. Galactic formaldehyde masing is one such example that remains problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hoffman|author2=Goss|author3=Patrick Palmer|author4=Richards|title=The Formaldehyde Masers in NGC 7538 and G29.96-0.02: VLBA, MERLIN, and   VLA Observations|doi=10.1086/379062|date=2003|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=598|issue=2|pages=1061–1075|arxiv=astro-ph/0308256|bibcode = 2003ApJ...598.1061H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some masers have been predicted to occur theoretically but have yet to be observed in nature. For example, the [[magnetic dipole]] transitions of the OH molecule near 53&amp;nbsp;MHz are expected to occur but have yet to be observed, perhaps due to a lack of sensitive equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Menon|author2=Anish Roshi|author3=Rajendra Prasad|title=A search for 53 MHz OH line near G48.4$-$1.4 using the National MST   Radar Facility|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2004.08517.x|date=2005|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=356|issue=3|pages=958–962|arxiv=astro-ph/0501649|bibcode = 2005MNRAS.356..958M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Backcrossing''' is a crossing of a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] with one of its [[parent]]s or an individual genetically similar to its parent, in order to achieve offspring with a genetic identity which is closer to that of the parent. It is used in horticulture, animal breeding and in production of [[gene knockout]] organisms.&lt;!-- explain how this is the same or different from inbreeding --&gt;

Backcrossed hybrids are sometimes described with [[acronym]] "BC", for example, an [[F1 hybrid]] crossed with one of its parents (or a genetically similar individual) can be termed a BC1 hybrid, and a further cross of the BC1 hybrid to the same parent (or a genetically similar individual) produces a BC2 hybrid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schweitzer, J.A. |author2=Martinsen, G.D. |author3=Whitham, T.G. |year=2002|title=Cottonwood hybrids gain fitness traits of both parents: a mechanism for their long-term persistence?|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=89|issue=6|pages=981–990|url=http://www.amjbot.org/content/89/6/981.abstract|doi=10.3732/ajb.89.6.981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages===
* If the recurrent parent is an elite [[genotype]], at the end of the backcrossing programme an elite genotype is recovered.
* As there is no "new" [[Genetic recombination|recombination]], the elite combination is not lost.

===Disadvantages===
* Works poorly for [[quantitative trait]]s
* Is more restricted for [[recessive trait]]s
* In practice, sections of [[genome]] from the non-recurrent parents are often still present and can have unwanted traits associated with them
* For very wide crosses, limited recombination may maintain thousands of ‘alien’ genes within the elite [[cultivar]]
* Many backcrosses are required to produce a new cultivar which can take many years

===Natural backcrossings===
York radiate groundsel (''[[Senecio eboracensis]]'') is a naturally occurring hybrid species of Oxford ragwort (''[[Senecio squalidus]]'') and common groundsel (''[[Senecio vulgaris]]''). It is thought to have arisen from a backcrossing of the F1 hybrid with ''S. vulgaris''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A new British species, ''Senecio eboracensis'' (Asteraceae), another hybrid derivative of ''S. vulgaris'' L. and ''S. squalidae'' L |url=http://www.watsonia.org.uk/Vol24p375.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Watsonia |last=Abbot |first=R.J. |author2=Lowe, A.J. |year=2003 |volume=24 |pages= 375–388 |accessdate=2007-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927221840/http://www.watsonia.org.uk/Vol24p375.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Again, the pure tall (TT) and pure dwarf (tt) pea plants when crossed in the parental generation, they produce all heterozygote (Tt) tall pea plants in the first filial generation. The cross between first filial heterozygote tall (Tt) pea plant and pure tall (TT) or pure dwarf (tt) pea plant of the parental generation is also an example for the back-crossing between two plants. In this case, the filial generation formed after the back cross may have a phenotype ratio of 1:1 if the cross is made with recessive parent or else all offspring may be having phenotype of dominant trait if back cross is with parent having dominant trait. The former of these traits is also called a test cross.

===Artificially recombinant lines===
In plants, ''inbred backcross lines'' (IBLs) refers to [[lineage (evolution)|line]]s (i.e. [[population]]s) of plants derived from the repeated backcrossing of a line with artificially [[recombinant DNA]] with the [[wild type]], operating some kind of [[Selection (biology)|selection]] that can be [[phenotype|phenotypical]] or through a [[molecular marker]] (for the production of [[introgression line]]s).

==Animals==

[[File:Backcrossing mice from chimera.svg|right|450px|thumb|This image demonstrates backcrossing of a heterozygous mouse from one genetic background onto another genetic background. In this example, the gene knockout is performed on 129/Sv cells and then backcrossed into the C57B/6J genetic background. With each successive backcross, there is an increase in the percentage of C57B/6J DNA that constitutes the genome of the offspring.]]

Backcrossing may be deliberately employed in animals to transfer a desirable trait in an animal of inferior genetic background to an animal of preferable genetic background. In gene knockout experiments in particular, where the knockout is performed on easily [[cell culture|cultured]] [[stem cell]] lines, but is required in an animal with a different genetic background, the knockout animal is backcrossed against the animal of the required genetic background. As the figure shows, each time that the mouse with the desired trait (in this case the lack of a gene (i.e. a knockout), indicated by the presence of a [[positive selectable marker]]) is crossed with a mouse of a constant genetic background, the average percentage of the genetic material of the offspring that is derived from that constant background increases. The result, after sufficient reiterations, is an animal with the desired trait in the desired genetic background, with the percentage of genetic material from the original stem cells reduced to a minimum (in the order of 0.01%).&lt;ref name="virginiauniversity"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/transgenic-mouse/aboutESC.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909215322/http://www.healthsystem.virginia.edu/internet/transgenic-mouse/aboutESC.cfm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-09 |title=Embryonic Stem Cell |accessdate=2008-01-01 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the nature of meiosis, in which chromosomes derived from each parent are randomly shuffled and assigned to each nascent gamete, the percentage of genetic material deriving from either cell-line will vary between offspring of a single crossing but will have an [[expected value]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10068">'''Bayesian tool for methylation analysis''', also known as '''BATMAN''', is a statistical tool for analysing [[methylated DNA immunoprecipitation]] (MeDIP) profiles. It can be applied to large datasets generated using either [[oligonucleotide]] arrays (MeDIP-chip) or [[next-generation sequencing]] (MeDIP-seq), providing a quantitative estimation of absolute [[methylation]] state in a region of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Down, T.A. et al. A Bayesian deconvolution strategy for immunoprecipitation-based DNA methylome analysis. ''Nature Biotechnology'' '''26''', 779–85 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Batman final diagram.tif|thumb|right|'''Batman workflow''']]

==Theory==
MeDIP (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation) is an experimental technique used to assess [[DNA]] methylation levels by using an [[antibody]] to isolate methylated DNA sequences. The isolated fragments of DNA are either hybridized to a microarray chip (MeDIP-chip) or sequenced by next-generation sequencing (MeDIP-seq). While this tells you what areas of the [[genome]] are methylated, it does not give absolute methylation levels. Imagine two different genomic regions, ''A'' and ''B''. Region ''A'' has six CpGs (DNA methylation in mammalian [[somatic cell]]s generally occurs at CpG [[dinucleotide]]s&lt;ref&gt;Lister, R. ''et al''. Human DNA [[methylome]]s at base resolution show widespread [[epigenomic]] differences. ''Nature'' '''462''', 315–22 (2009).&lt;/ref&gt;), three of which are methylated. Region ''B'' has three CpGs, all of which are methylated. As the antibody simply recognizes [[methylated DNA]], it will bind both these regions equally and subsequent steps will therefore show equal signals for these two regions. This does not give the full picture of methylation in these two regions (in region ''A'' only half the CpGs are methylated, whereas in region ''B'' all the CpGs are methylated). Therefore, to get the full picture of methylation for a given region you have to normalize the signal you get from the MeDIP experiment to the number of CpGs in the region, and this is what the Batman [[algorithm]] does. Analysing the MeDIP signal of the above example would give Batman scores of 0.5 for region ''A'' (i.e. the region is 50% methylated) and 1 for region ''B'' (i.e. The region is 100% methylated). In this way Batman converts the signals from MeDIP experiments to absolute methylation levels.

==Development of Batman==
The core principle of the Batman algorithm is to model the effects of varying density of CpG dinucleotides, and the effect this has on MeDIP enrichment of DNA fragments.
The basic assumptions of Batman:
# Almost all DNA methylation in [[mammal]]s happens at CpG dinucleotides.
# Most CpG-poor regions are constitutively methylated while most CpG-rich regions (CpG islands) are constitutively unmethylated.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, A. DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory. ''Genes &amp; Development'' '''16''', 6–21 (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;
# There are no fragment biases in MeDIP experiment (approximate range of DNA fragment sizes is 400–700 bp).
# The errors on the [[microarray]] are normally distributed with precision.
# Only methylated CpGs contribute to the observed signal.
# CpG methylation state is generally highly correlated over hundreds of bases,&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, F. ''et al''. DNA methylation profiling of human chromosomes 6, 20 and 22. ''Nature Genetics'' '''38''', 1378–85 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; so CpGs grouped together in 50- or 100-bp windows would have the same methylation state.

Basic parameters in Batman:
# C&lt;sub&gt;cp&lt;/sub&gt;: coupling factor between probe p and CpG dinucleotide ''c'', is defined as the fraction of DNA [[molecule]]s hybridizing to probe ''p'' that contain the CpG&amp;nbsp;''c''.
# C&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; : total CpG influence parameter, is defined as the sum of coupling factors for any given probe, which provides a measure of local CpG density
# m&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; : the methylation status at position ''c'', which represents the fraction of [[chromosome]]s in the sample on which it is methylated. m&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is considered as a [[continuous variable]] since the majority samples used in MeDIP studies contain multiple cell-types.
Based on these assumptions, the signal from the MeDIP channel of the MeDIP-chip or MeDIP-seq experiment depends on the degree of enrichment of DNA fragments overlapping that probe, which in turn depends on the amount of [[antibody binding]], and thus to the number of methylated CpGs on those fragments. In Batman model, the complete dataset from a MeDIP/chip experiment, A, can be represented by a statistical model in the form of the following [[probability distribution]]:

: &lt;math&gt; f(A \mid m) = \prod_p \phi \left(A_p \mid A_\text{base} + r\sum_c C_{cp}, \nu^{-1}  \right) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;(''x''|''μ'',&amp;nbsp;''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) is a [[normal distribution|Gaussian]] [[probability density function]]. Standard [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian]] techniques can be used to infer ''f''(''m''|''A''), that is, the distribution of likely methylation states given one or more sets of MeDIP-chip/MeDIP-seq outputs. To solve this inference problem, Batman uses [[nested sampling]] (http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/bayesys/) to generate 100 independent samples from ''f''(''m''|''A'') for each tiled region of the genome, then summarizes the most likely methylation state in 100-bp windows by fitting beta distributions to these samples. The modes of the most likely [[beta distribution]]s were used as final methylation calls.

==Work flow of Batman==
{{howto|section|date=October 2017}}
Batman prerequisites:
# Installation: install Batman(freely available from https://github.com/dasmoth/batman under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]]), Apache ANT, [[MySQL]] [[database server]], and MySQL database connector.
# Prepare dataset: break your [[dataset]] into small blocks, namely [[Region of interest|regions of interest]] (ROIs), each represented by a small number (typically about 100) probes on a microarray.
# Identify the database server: connect to a MySQL database server using both the MySQL administration tool, and many of the Batman programs.
# Initialize the Batman database: create a database on your database server.
# Register the experiments to be analysed.
# Register the array design: The array design (i.e. complete list of probes, with their genomic locations) should be provided as a GFF file.
# Load the array data.
# Load the genome sequence.

Run Batman:
# Calibrate the Batman model: Before any data can be analysed, it is necessary to calibrate each array by estimating how much extra array signal is produced by each methylated CpG. This step can give you a quick idea whether each of your arrays is giving sensible results.
# Sample methylation states from the Batman model: You’ll often have multiple arrays from the same experiment, and these should normally be analysed together to improve the confidence of the final calls. Each chromosome can take several days to process; therefore, if possible, run several in parallel.
# Summarize methylation states to generate the final calls: The “sample” files generated by Batman contain a large set of plausible methylation states for each region. For most purposes, you’ll actually want a single estimate of the likely methylation state at that position, and perhaps an estimate of how confident you can be that this is actually the correct value.

Visualization of Batman Data:
# The output is in [[General feature format|GFF format]]. For each window, a score (range: 0–1) is given which represents a likely fraction of methylation and the interquartile range is given as an estimate of confidence.
# Several [[genome browser]]s are available, such as [[Ensembl]] genome browser, which uses a colour gradient from 20 (bright yellow) to 80 (dark blue) to show the Batman methylation score for each probe in the ROI.
More details related to Batman procedure can be found in Batman manual freely online from https://web.archive.org/web/20110304143135/http://td-blade.gurdon.cam.ac.uk/software/batman/batmanual-alpha-0.2.3.pdf

==Limitations==
It may be useful to take the following points into account when considering using Batman:

# Batman is not a piece of [[software]]; it is an algorithm performed using the [[Command-line interface#Command prompt|command prompt]]. As such it is not especially user-friendly and is quite a computationally technical process.
# Because it is non-commercial, there is very little support when using Batman beyond what is in the manual.
# It is quite time consuming (it can take several days to analyse one chromosome). (Note: In one government lab, running Batman on a set of 100 Agilent Human DNA Methylation Arrays (about 250,000 probes per array) took less than an hour to complete in Agilent's Genomic Workbench software. Our computer had a 2GHz processor, 24 GB RAM, 64-bit Windows 7.)
# [[Copy number variation]] (CNV) has to be accounted for. For example, the score for a region with a [[CNV value]] of 1.6 in a [[cancer]] (a loss of 0.4 compared to normal) would have to be multiplied by 1.25 (=2/1.6) to compensate for the loss.
# One of the basic assumptions of Batman is that all DNA methylation occurs at CpG dinucleotides. While this is generally the case for [[vertebrate]] somatic cells, there are situations where there is widespread non-CpG methylation, such as in plant cells  and [[embryonic stem cell]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Dodge, J.E., Ramsahoye, B.H., Wo, Z.G., Okano, M. &amp; Li, E.

The '''bedding ceremony''' refers to the [[wedding]] custom of putting the [[newlywed]] couple together in the marital bed before numerous witnesses, thereby completing the [[marriage]]. In most traditions the newlyweds were put in bed by their family, friends, and neighbors.

The purpose of the ritual was to establish the [[consummation]] of the marriage, either by actually witnessing the couple's first [[sexual intercourse]] or symbolically, by leaving before consummation. It symbolized the [[community]]'s involvement in the marriage. The legally binding nature of the ceremony varied greatly from place to place and through time.

==Traditions==
[[File:Brauysegen im Bett.gif|thumb|Reymont and Melusina blessed by the bishop in their bed on their wedlock, 15th-century woodcut]]
[[File:Carl X Gustav of Sweden &amp; Hedwig Eleanor of Sweden c 1654 by Juriaen Ovens.jpg|thumb|After the wedding in 1654 between [[Charles X Gustav of Sweden]] and [[Hedvig Eleonora of Holstein-Gottorp]].]]

Bedding rituals have been practiced in various cultures, the ceremony differing from place to place. The people putting the newlyweds in bed have usually included their family, friends and wider community.{{sfn|Bailey|Barclay|2017|p=44}} The ritual is often associated with music, bawdy songs and jokes. It symbolised the community's involvement in the marriage and especially in the couple's [[sexual intimacy]], but also their [[marital fidelity]]. The consummation itself, i.e. the couple's first [[sexual intercourse]], was not witnessed in most of [[Western Europe]].{{sfn|Bailey|Barclay|2017|p=45}}

In England, the ceremony usually began with a priest [[Christian blessing|blessing]] the bed, after which the newlyweds prepared themselves for bed and drank [[sweet wine|sweet]] and [[spicy wine]]. The [[groomsmen]] and the [[bridesmaid]]s then sat on the sides of the bed and threw the couple's [[stocking]]s at them; a hit was believed to indicate that the thrower would soon marry. Finally the curtains were drawn around the bed and the couple were left alone. Some newlyweds refused to take part in the bedding ceremony. [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] of England ({{reign|1625|1649}}) notably barred the door of his bedroom; however, despite his rejection, the custom remained prevalent for another century among all social classes, including the royal family.{{sfn|Monger|2004|p=23}}{{refn|The bedding ritual was fully observed at the wedding of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]]'s niece and nephew, [[Mary II of England|Mary]] and [[William III of England|William]], with the King himself drawing the curtains.{{sfn|Monger|2004|p=24}}|group=nb}}

In the 16th century, in what is now Germany, the bedding ceremony was performed to the sound of [[Pipe (instrument)|pipes]], [[drums]] and "obscene noises", after which the couple were left alone and the guests continued celebrating loudly enough for the newlyweds not to be heard. In many places, the newlyweds were dressed for bed separately by their family or community and then led to the bedroom.{{sfn|Bailey|Barclay|2017|p=44}} In others, the couple were expected to rejoin the party afterwards.{{sfn|Korpiolla|2009|p=61}} During the [[Reformation era]], the bedding ceremony was associated with rituals that assigned socioeconomic rights and duties to the bride as [[housewife]].{{sfn|Bailey|Barclay|2017|p=45}}

In [[Scandinavia]], it was the most distinguished wedding guest who led the bride to bed in a festive procession.{{refn|The [[Mayor of Stockholm]] led the bride {{circa}} 1416. In 1528, the Swedish king [[Gustav Vasa]] performed the role at the wedding of his trusted servant.{{sfn|Korpiolla|2009|p=61}}|group=nb}} After putting them in bed, the guests offered dishes to the couple and quickly ate with them before leaving them alone. Due to the ritual's importance, specially decorated wedding beds were sometimes borrowed from friends, family or neighbours. The bedding eventually became merely symbolic, with the bride's parents covering the newlyweds with a blanket and then uncovering them.{{sfn|Korpiolla|2009|p=61}}

==Legal consequences==
The original purpose of the bedding ceremony was to establish the [[consummation]] of the marriage, without which the union could be [[annulled]]. The legally binding nature of the ritual was unclear to many, particularly to lower classes. One marriage in Britain was annulled on the pretext that the bride had run away within 15 minutes of the ritual, and in another case, a clandestine marriage was made public when the pregnant wife shared her husband's deathbed.{{sfn|Stone|1992|p=22}} Public bedding in 18th-century Britain was widely believed to give additional legitimacy to the marriage.{{sfn|Stone|1992|p=163}} In Scotland, although marriage was formed by simple consent and required no formalities or consummation,{{sfn|Bailey|Barclay|2017|p=47}} the bedding rituals were widespread but unstructured; a couple simply wanted someone to see them in bed together. A couple could also be pressured into marriage in this way: a person stumbling upon an unmarried couple in bed could pronounce them man and wife on the spot.{{sfn|Bailey|Barclay|2017|p=48}}

In medieval Scandinavia, the bedding ceremony was of great legal importance. Laws in many [[Swedish province]]s regarded public bedding as essential to the completion of a marriage,{{sfn|Korpiolla|2009|p=60}} but the legal importance later diminished due to new royal laws.{{sfn|Korpiolla|2009|p=61}} In Iceland, a marriage was only valid if it included the bedding ritual witnessed by at least six men.{{sfn|Korpiolla|2009|p=62}}

In the case of royal marriages, the ceremony took on added significance.

==In popular culture==
The bedding ritual has featured in popular culture for centuries. It has been hinted at in ''The Penny Wedding'', an 1818 painting by [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]], and possibly also in the homonymous 1819 painting by [[Alexander Carse]]. Numerous songs also make references to the ceremony.{{sfn|Bailey|Barclay|2017|p=47}}

In the television series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', a bedding ceremony features in several episodes. It is conceived as a "[[Westeros]]i tradition following the wedding feast", wherein the attendees forcibly undress and carry the newlyweds to their bed. The intention is to "celebrate a marriage's consummation".{{sfn|Lucas|2015}}

The '''Berlin School of Library and Information Science''' at [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt Universität zu Berlin]] (in German, "'''Institut für Bibliotheks- und Informationswissenschaft'''") offers study programmes at three levels: bachelors, masters (both a standard program and a postgraduate distant learning program), and doctoral. It is the only institute in Germany with a doctoral programme and the right to award doctorates. Research methods are also an integral part of the pre-doctoral curriculum.

The Berlin School is part of a growing [[list of i-schools]] devoted to the study of information as a discipline. It is one of two members in Germany and the only one in the iCaucus group.

==History==

The Berlin School traces its roots back to the early 20th century. It was closed for a time during the Nazi era. After [[German reunification]] in 1990, the two library programs at the [[Free University of Berlin]] and at [[Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin]] were combined. During the initial years of the 21st century the university had to decide whether to close the school or to transform it. The university decided on transformation and set about gathering the financial resources to make that happen.

In the past the School had offered a quality but fundamentally conventional German library program with a strong emphasis on history and the practical skills necessary to be effective in an entry-level position at a German library. The goal in 2006 became the creation of an internationally competitive “iSchool” on the explicit model of the School of Information at the University of Michigan. It was strengthened with the addition of Peter Schirmbacher and Michael Seadle as new professors at the highest (W3) rank. Schirmbacher brought a wealth of successful digital projects with him and Seadle brought experience with comparable projects plus US connections. Other new faculty included Stefan Gradmann (2008-2013) and Vivien Petras, both of whom led important parts of the Europeana project. Konrad Umlauf completes the spectrum as an expert on public libraries and library management.

Key elements of this transformation included a curriculum with significantly more emphasis on the digital future and the skills necessary to function within that environment. The curriculum put strong emphasis on research and research methods, partly because the Berlin School is the only library and information program at a research-oriented university in Germany, and partly because problem solving in the digital environment inherently involves research. The research emphasis was  also intended to distinguish Humboldt's program from those of the “universities of applied sciences” (''Fachhochschule'').&lt;ref&gt;Seadle, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berlin Library Science Colloquium==
The Berlin Library Science Colloquium ("Berlin Bibliothekswissenschaftliches Kolloquium", BBK). offers during each semester a range of international speakers on current topics of information science, innovative projects and library and information science research. Most presentations (either in English or German) are available as recordings from the BBK-Website .&lt;ref&gt;BBK, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
Below are only some of the national and international projects in which the Berlin School plays a significant role. For a full list of projects, see: http://www.ibi.hu-berlin.de/forschung/forschungsprojekte


'''Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana'''&lt;ref&gt;DM2E Project, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; (2012-2015) aims to technically enable as many content providers as possible to integrate their content into Europeana. 

'''re3data.org''' [[Registry_of_Research_Data_Repositories|registry of research data repositories]] (2012-2014) &lt;ref&gt;re3data.org (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
The goal of re3data.org is to create a global registry of research data repositories from different academic disciplines. re3data.org presents repositories for the permanent storage and access of data sets to researchers, funding bodies, publishers and scholarly institutions. In the course of this mission re3data.org aims to promote a culture of sharing, increased access and better visibility of research data.

'''LuKII''' ([[LOCKSS]] und KOPAL Infrastruktur und Interoperabilität) (2009-2012) was a project sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.&lt;ref&gt;LuKII, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The project proposes interoperability between the open-source elements of two existing archiving systems (LOCKSS and KOPAL) in order to combine cost-effective bitstream preservation with an established tool for usability maintenance and format migration.
The German National Library was a partner on LuKII.

'''IUWIS''' (Infrastruktur Urheberrecht für Wissenschaft und Bildung) (2009-2011) is also project sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.&lt;ref&gt;IUWIS, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It offers information and discussion opportunities about copyright for research and education, and aims both as the producers of copyright-protected information as well as users. The University of Constance was a partner on IUWIS.

==Building &amp; Location==

The School's home is a 1903 building by architects [[Cremer &amp; Wolffenstein|Wilhelm Cremer und Richard Wolffenstein]] and can be found Dorotheenstraße 26, directly across from the historic Main Building or Hauptgebäude of the university.&lt;ref&gt;IBI, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''biblical manuscript''' is any handwritten copy of a portion of the text of the [[Bible]]. The word ''Bible'' comes from the Greek ''biblia'' (books); ''[[manuscript]]'' comes from Latin ''manu'' (hand) and ''scriptum'' (written). Biblical manuscripts vary in size from tiny scrolls containing individual verses of the Jewish scriptures (see [[Tefillin]]) to huge [[Polyglot (book)|polyglot]] [[codices]] (multi-lingual books) containing both the Hebrew Bible ([[Tanakh]]) and the [[New Testament]], as well as [[Biblical canon|extracanonical]] works.

The study of biblical manuscripts is important because handwritten copies of books can contain errors. The science of [[textual criticism]] attempts to reconstruct the original text of books, especially those published prior to the [[movable type|invention of the printing press]].

==Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh) manuscripts==

{{main article|List of Hebrew Bible manuscripts}}

The [[Aleppo Codex]] (c. 920 CE) and [[Leningrad Codex]] (c. 1008 CE) were the oldest Hebrew language manuscripts of the [[Tanakh]]. In 1947 CE the finding of the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] at [[Qumran]] pushed the manuscript history of the Tanakh back a millennium from the two earliest complete codices. Before this discovery, the earliest extant manuscripts of the [[Old Testament]] were in Greek in manuscripts such as [[Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]]. Out of the roughly 800 manuscripts found at Qumran, 220 are from the Tanakh. Every book of the Tanakh is represented except for the [[Book of Esther]]; however, most are fragmentary. Notably, there are two [[scroll]]s of the [[Book of Isaiah]], one complete ([[1QIs-a|1QIs&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;]]), and one around 75% complete ([[1QIs-b|1QIs&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;]]). These manuscripts generally date between 150 BCE to 70 CE.{{sfn|Bruce|1964}}

==New Testament manuscripts==

[[File:Codex Alexandrinus f41v - Luke.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Folio 41v from [[Codex Alexandrinus]] contains the [[Gospel of Luke]] with decorative tailpiece.]]
The [[New Testament]] has been preserved in more manuscripts than any other ancient work of literature, with over 5,800 complete or fragmented [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts catalogued, 10,000 [[Latin]] manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. The dates of these manuscripts range from c. 125 (the {{Papyrus link|52}} papyrus, oldest copy of John fragments) to the introduction of printing in Germany in the 15th century.

Often, especially in monasteries, a manuscript cache was little more than a former manuscript recycling centre, where imperfect and incomplete copies of manuscripts were stored while the monastery or scriptorium decided what to do with them.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}} There were several options. The first was to simply "wash" the manuscript and reuse it. Such reused manuscripts were called [[palimpsest]]s and were very common in the ancient world until the [[Middle Ages]]. One notable palimpsest is the [[Archimedes Palimpsest]]. If not done within a short period of time after the papyri was made, washing it was less likely since the papyri might deteriorate and thus be unusable. When washing was no longer an option, the second choice was burning. Since the manuscripts contained the words of Christ, they were thought to have had a level of sanctity;{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}} burning them was considered more reverent than simply throwing them into a garbage pit, which occasionally happened (as in the case of [[Oxyrhynchus 840]]). The third option was to leave them in what has become known as a manuscript gravesite. When scholars come across manuscript caches, such as at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in the [[Sinai]] (the source of the [[Codex Sinaiticus]]), or Saint Sabbas Monastery outside [[Bethlehem]], they are finding not libraries but storehouses of rejected texts{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}} sometimes kept in boxes or back shelves in libraries due to space constraints. The texts were unacceptable because of their scribal errors and contain corrections inside the lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/ |title=Codex Sinaiticus |accessdate=2008-12-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081231104440/http://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/ |archivedate=2008-12-31 |website=Codex Sinaiticus Website }}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly evidence that monastery scribes compared them to a master text. In addition, texts thought to be complete and correct but had deteriorated for heavy usage or had missing [[wikt:folio|folios]] would also be placed in the [[Treasure trove|caches]]. Once in a cache, insects and humidity would often contribute to the continued deterioration of the documents.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}}

Complete and correctly-copied texts would usually be immediately placed in use and so wore out fairly quickly, which required frequent recopying. Manuscript copying was very costly when it required a scribe's attention for extended periods so a [[manuscript]] might be made only when it was commissioned. The size of the [[parchment]], [[writing system|script]] used, any illustrations (thus raising the effective cost) and whether it was one book or a collection of several would be determined by the one commissioning the work. Stocking extra copies would likely have been considered wasteful and unnecessary since the form and the presentation of a manuscript were typically customized to the aesthetic tastes of the buyer.

Due to the prevalence of manuscript caches, scholars today are more likely to find incomplete and sometimes conflicting segments of manuscripts rather than complete and largely consistent works.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005}}

===Transmission===
The task of copying manuscripts was generally done by [[scribe]]s who were trained professionals in the arts of writing and bookmaking. Some manuscripts were also proofread, and scholars closely examining a text can sometimes find the original and corrections found in certain manuscripts. In the 6th century, a special room devoted to the practice of manuscript writing and [[illuminated manuscript|illumination]] called the [[scriptorium]] came into use, typically inside medieval European monasteries. Sometimes a group of scribes would make copies at the same time as one individual read from the text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/mss_trans.html|title=Seid|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manuscript construction===

An important issue with manuscripts is preservation. The earliest New Testament manuscripts were written on [[papyrus]], made from a reed that grew abundantly in the [[Nile Delta]]. This tradition continued as late as the 8th century.{{sfn|Metzger|Ehrman|2005|p=3f}} Papyrus eventually becomes brittle and deteriorates with age. The dry climate of Egypt allowed some papyrus manuscripts to be partially preserved, but, with the exception of {{Papyrus link|77}}, no New Testament papyrus manuscript is complete; many consist only of a single fragmented page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/intro.html#MSTypes|title=Waltz|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the fourth century, [[parchment]] (also called [[vellum]]) began to be a common medium for New Testament manuscripts.{{sfn|Metzger|Ehrman|2005|pp=3-10}} It wasn't until the twelfth century that [[paper]] (made from cotton or plant fibers), which was invented in first-century [[China]], began to gain popularity in biblical manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 476 non-Christian manuscripts dated to the second century, 97% of the manuscripts are in the form of [[scroll]]s; however, eight Christian manuscripts are [[codex|codices]]. In fact, most New Testament manuscripts are codices. The adaptation of the codex form in non-Christian text did not become dominant until the fourth and fifth centuries, showing a preference for that form amongst early Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/codex.html|title=Seid|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The considerable length of some New Testament books (such as the [[Pauline epistles]]), and the New Testament itself, was not suited to the limited space available on a single scroll; in contrast a codex could be expanded to hundreds of pages.  On its own, however, length alone is an insufficient reason - after all, the Jewish scriptures would continue to be transmitted on scrolls for centuries to come.{{sfn|Kruger|2012|p=249}} Scholars have argued that the codex was adopted as a product of the formation of the New Testament canon, allowing for a specific collections of documents like the Gospels and the Pauline Epistles.{{sfn|Kruger|2012|p=250}} "Canon and codex go hand in hand in the sense that the adoption of a fixed canon could be more easily controlled and promulgated when the codex was the means of gathering together originally separate compositions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Elliott |first1=J.K. |title=Manuscripts, the Codex, and the Canon |journal=Journal for the Study of the New Testament |date=1996 |issue=63 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Script and other features===
[[Image:BookOfDurrowBeginMarkGospel.jpg|thumb|upright|The beginning of the [[Gospel of Mark]] from the [[Book of Durrow]].]]
The handwriting found in New Testament manuscripts varies. One way of classifying handwriting is by formality: book-hand vs. cursive. More formal, literary Greek works were often written in a distinctive style of even, capital letters called book-hand. Less formal writing consisted of cursive letters which could be written quickly. Another way of dividing handwriting is between [[uncial script]] (or majuscule) and [[Roman cursive#New Roman cursive|minuscule]]. The uncial letters were a consistent height between the [[baseline (typography)|baseline]] and the cap height, while the minuscule letters had [[Ascender (typography)|ascenders]] and [[descender]]s that moved past the baseline and cap height. Generally speaking, the majuscules are earlier than the minuscules, with a dividing line roughly in the 11th century.{{sfn|Metzger|Ehrman|2005|pp=17-18, 20}}

The earliest manuscripts had negligible punctuation and breathing marks. The manuscripts also lacked word spacing, so words, sentences, and paragraphs would be a continuous string of letters ([[scriptio continua]]), often with line breaks in the middle of words. Bookmaking was an expensive endeavor, and one way to reduce the number of pages used was to save space. Another method employed was to abbreviate frequent words, such as the ''[[nomina sacra]]''. Yet another method involved the [[palimpsest]], a manuscript which recycled an older manuscript. Scholars using careful examination can sometimes determine what was originally written on the material of a document before it was erased to make way for a new text (for example ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]]'' and the ''[[Syriac Sinaiticus]]'').

The original New Testament books did not have titles, section headings, or [[Chapters and verses of the Bible|verse and chapter divisions]]. These were developed over the years as "helps for readers". The [[Eusebian Canons]] were an early system of division written in the margin of many manuscripts. The Eusebian Canons are a series of tables that grouped parallel stories among the gospels. Starting in the fifth century, subject headings ([[:wikt:κεφαλαία|κεφαλαία]]) were used.

Manuscripts became more ornate over the centuries, which developed into a rich [[illuminated manuscript]] tradition, including the famous Irish [[Gospel Book]]s, the ''[[Book of Kells]]'' and the ''[[Book of Durrow]]''.

===Cataloging===
[[File:SinopeGospelsFolio29rChristHealingBlind.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A page from the [[Sinope Gospels]]. The miniature at the bottom shows [[Jesus]] healing the blind.]]
[[Desiderius Erasmus]] compiled the first printed edition of the Greek New Testament in 1516, basing his work on several manuscripts because he did not have a single complete work and because each manuscript had small errors. In the 18th century, [[Johann Jakob Wettstein]] was one of the first biblical scholars to start cataloging biblical manuscripts. He divided the manuscripts based on the writing used ([[uncial]], minuscule) or format ([[Lectionary|lectionaries]]) and based on content ([[Gospel]]s, [[Pauline epistles|Pauline letters]], [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] + [[General epistles]], and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]). He assigned the uncials letters and minuscules and lectionaries numbers for each grouping of content, which resulted in manuscripts being assigned the same letter or number.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

For manuscripts that contained the whole New Testament, such as [[Codex Alexandrinus]] (A) and [[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus]] (C), the letters corresponded across content groupings. For significant early manuscripts such as [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209]] (B), which did not contain Revelation, the letter B was also assigned to a later 10th-century manuscript of Revelation, thus creating confusion. [[Constantin von Tischendorf]] found one of the earliest, nearly complete copies of the Bible, [[Codex Sinaiticus]], over a century after Wettstein's cataloging system was introduced. Because he felt the manuscript was so important, Von Tischendorf assigned it the Hebrew letter [[aleph]] (א). Eventually enough uncials were found that all the letters in the [[Latin alphabet]] had been used, and scholars moved on to first the [[Greek alphabet]], and eventually started reusing characters by adding a [[superscript]]. Confusion also existed in the minuscules, where up to seven different manuscripts could have the same number or a single manuscript of the complete New Testament could have 4 different numbers to describe the different content groupings.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 72-73&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor | Von Soden}}Von Soden====

[[Hermann, Freiherr von Soden]] published a complex cataloging system for manuscripts in 1902-10.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann von Soden, ''Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments, in ihrer ältesten erreichbaren Textgestalt hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte'' 4 vols., Berlin: Glaue, 1902-1910.&lt;/ref&gt; He grouped the manuscripts based on content, assigning them a Greek prefix: δ for the complete New Testament, ε for the Gospels, and α for the remaining parts. This grouping was flawed because some manuscripts grouped in δ did not contain Revelation, and many manuscripts grouped in α contained either the general epistles or the Pauline epistles, but not both. After the Greek prefix, Von Soden assigned a numeral that roughly corresponded to a date (for example δ1-δ49 were from before the 10th century, δ150-δ249 for the 11th century). This system proved to be problematic when manuscripts were re-dated, or when more manuscripts were discovered than the number of spaces allocated to a certain century.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;

===={{anchor | Gregory-Aland}}Gregory–Aland====

[[Caspar René Gregory]] published another cataloging system in 1908 in ''Die griechischen Handschriften des Neuen Testaments'', which is the system still in use today. Gregory divided the manuscripts into four groupings: papyri, uncials, minuscules, and [[Lectionary|lectionaries]]. This division is partially arbitrary. The first grouping is based on the physical material ([[papyrus]]) used in the manuscripts. The second two divisions are based on script: uncial and minuscule. The last grouping is based on content: lectionary. Most of the papyrus manuscripts and the lectionaries before the year 1000 are written in uncial script. There is some consistency in that the majority of the papyri are very early because parchment began to replace papyrus in the 4th century (although the latest papyri dates to the 8th century). Similarly, the majority of the uncials date to before the 11th century, and the majority of the minuscules to after.&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 73-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory assigned the papyri a prefix of '''P''', often written in [[blackletter]] script ({{Papyrus|n}}), with a superscript numeral. The uncials were given a prefix of the number 0, and the established letters for the major manuscripts were retained for redundancy (''e.g.'' [[Codex Claromontanus]] is assigned both '''06''' and '''D'''). The minuscules were given plain numbers, and the lectionaries were prefixed with '''''l''''' often written in script ('''ℓ'''). [[Kurt Aland]] continued Gregory's cataloging work through the 1950s and beyond. Because of this, the numbering system is often referred to as "Gregory-Aland numbers". The most recent manuscripts added to each grouping are {{Papyrus link|131}}, [[Uncial 323|0323]], [[Minuscule 2928|2928]], and ''ℓ'' 2463.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntvmr.uni-muenster.de/liste New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room] at the [[University of Münster]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the cataloging heritage and because some manuscripts which were initially numbered separately were discovered to be from the same codex, there is some redundancy in the list (''i.e.'' the [[Magdalen papyrus]] has both the numbers of {{Papyrus|64}} and {{Papyrus|67}}).&lt;ref&gt;Aland 1995, pp. 73f&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of New Testament textual criticism deals with Greek manuscripts because scholars believe the original books of the New Testament were written in Greek. The text of the New Testament is also found both translated in manuscripts of many different languages (called ''versions'') and quoted in manuscripts of the writings of the [[Church Fathers]]. In the [[critical apparatus]] of the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], a series of abbreviations and prefixes designate different language versions (it for Old Latin, lowercase letters for individual Old Latin manuscripts, vg for [[Vulgate]], lat for Latin, sy&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; for [[Sinaitic Palimpsest]], sy&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt; for [[Curetonian Gospels]], sy&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt; for the [[Peshitta]], co for Coptic, ac for Akhmimic, bo for Bohairic, sa for Sahidic, arm for Armenian, geo for Georgian, got for Gothic, aeth for Ethiopic, and slav for Old Church Slavonic).&lt;ref&gt;NA&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt; 1996, pp. 64*-76*&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dating===
{{additional citations|section|date=October 2018}}
[[Image:Escribano.jpg|thumb|right|An illustration of a European [[scribe]] at work]]
The New Testament books appear to have been completed within the 1st century. The original manuscripts of the New Testament books are not known to have survived. The [[autograph]]s are believed to have been lost or destroyed a long time ago. What survives are copies of the original. Generally speaking, these copies were made centuries after the originals from other copies rather than from the autograph. [[Paleography]], a science of dating manuscripts by typological analysis of their scripts, is the most precise and objective means known for determining the age of a manuscript. Script groups belong typologically to their generation; and changes can be noted with great accuracy over relatively short periods of time. Dating of manuscript material by a [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dating test]] requires that a small part of the material be destroyed in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://original.britannica.com/eb/article-73398/biblical-literature#597996.hook|title=Britannica Online: Types of manuscript errors|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both radiocarbon and paleographical dating only give a range of possible dates, and it is still debated just how narrow this range might be. Dates established by radiocarbon dating can present a range of 10 to over 100 years. Similarly, dates established by paleography can present a range of 25 to over 125 years.&lt;ref&gt;F. V. Greifenhagen, ''Egypt on the Pentateuch's Ideological Map''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Earliest extant manuscripts====
The earliest manuscript of a New Testament text is a business-card-sized fragment from the [[Gospel of John]], [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], which may be as early as the first half of the 2nd century. The first complete copies of single New Testament books appear around 200, and the earliest complete copy of the New Testament, the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] dates to the 4th century.{{sfn|Ehrman|2004|pp=479-480}} The following table lists the earliest extant manuscript witnesses for the books of the [[New Testament]].

===Textual criticism===
{{main article|Textual Criticism}}
{{further|Textual variants in the New Testament|List of Bible verses not included in modern translations}}
[[Palaeography]] is the study of ancient writing, and [[textual criticism]] is the study of manuscripts in order to reconstruct a probable original text.

None of the original documents of the New Testament is known to scholars to be extant; and the existing manuscripts differ from one another. The textual critic seeks to ascertain from the divergent copies which form of the text should be regarded as most conforming to the original.{{sfn|Metzger|1992}} The [[New Testament]] has been preserved in three major manuscript traditions: the 4th-century-CE [[Alexandrian text-type]], the [[Western text-type]], and the [[Byzantine text-type]], which includes over 80% of all manuscripts, the majority comparatively very late in the tradition.

Since the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no ''a priori'' bias to a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament. This is reflected in the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], which since 2014 corresponds to both the United Bible Society, 5th edition and Nestle-Aland, 28th edition. In [[textual criticism]], eclecticism is the practice of examining a wide number of text witnesses and selecting the variant that seems best. The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence. Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the [[Alexandrian text-type]], are the most favored in these two publications; and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Barbara |last=Aland |first2=Joël |last2=Delobel |year=1994 |title=New Testament textual criticism, exegesis and church history: a discussion of methods |location=Kampen |publisher=Kok Pharos |p=138 |isbn=9-03-900105-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most English translations of the New Testament made in the 20th Century were based on these copies.

Textual scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]] writes: "It is true, of course, that the New Testament is abundantly attested in the manuscripts produced through the ages, but most of these manuscripts are many centuries removed from the originals, and none of them perfectly accurate. They all contain mistakes - altogether many thousands of mistakes. It is not an easy task to reconstruct the original words of the New Testament...."{{sfn|Ehrman|2004|p=449}} In reference to the textual evidence for the New Testament, [[Bruce M. Metzger]] wrote,

{{quote|In evaluating the significance of these statistics...one should consider, by way of contrast, the number of manuscripts which preserve the text of the ancient classics. Homer's ''[[Iliad]]''...is preserved by 457 papyri, 2 uncial manuscripts, and 188 minuscule manuscripts. Among the tragedians the witnesses to [[Euripides]] are the most abundant; his extant works are preserved in 54 papyri and 276 parchment manuscripts, almost all of the later dating from the Byzantine period...the time between the composition of the books of the New Testament and the earliest extant copies is relatively brief. Instead of the lapse of a millennium or more, as is the case of not a few classical authors, several papyrus manuscripts of portions of the New Testament are extant which were copies within a century or so after the composition of the original documents.{{sfn|Metzger|1992|pp=33-35}}{{efn|1=As a footnote to his comments, [[Bruce Metzger|Metzger]] also said, "Lest, however, the wrong impression be conveyed from the statistics given above regarding the total number of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, it should be pointed out that most of the [[New Testament papyrus|papyri]] are relatively fragmentary and that only about fifty manuscripts (of which the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] is the only [[Uncial script|Uncial manuscript]]) contain the entire New Testament."{{sfn|Metzger|1992|p=34}} }} }}

Biblical scholar [[Gary Habermas]] adds, 

{{quote|What is usually meant is that the New Testament has far more manuscript evidence from a far earlier period than other classical works. There are just under 6000 NT manuscripts, with copies of most of the NT dating from just 100 years or so after its writing. Classical sources almost always have fewer than 20 copies each and usually date from 700-1400 years after the composition of the work. In this regard, the classics are not as well attested. While this doesn't guarantee truthfulness, it means that it is much easier to reconstruct the New Testament text. Regarding genre, the Gospels are usually taken today to be examples of Roman biographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Reliability and Inspiration of the Bible  |website=Dr. Habermas Answers Important Questions |url=http://www.garyhabermas.com/qa/qa_index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Every year, several New Testament manuscripts handwritten in the original Greek format are discovered. The latest substantial find was in 2008, when 47 new manuscripts were discovered in [[Albania]]; at least 17 of them unknown to Western scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Michelle A |last=Vu |url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/nt.scholar.on.discovery.of.giant.trove.of.bible.manuscripts/18204.htm |title=NT scholar on discovery of giant trove of Bible manuscripts |work=[[Christianity Today]] |date=21 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been an estimate of 400,000 variations among all these manuscripts (from the 2nd to 15th century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Wallace |date=13 April 2009 |title=The Number of Textual Variants: An Evangelical Miscalculation |url=https://bible.org/article/number-textual-variants-evangelical-miscalculation}}&lt;/ref&gt; If you spread those 400,000 variations over 5,600 manuscripts, that comes out to only about 71 variations per manuscript, (400,000 divided by 5,600). And some of these manuscripts are the equivalent of several hundred pages of text, hand-written (see [[Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Alexandrinus]], et al.).  The number of variants is additionally less significant than may appear since it is a comparison across linguistic boundaries.  More important estimates focus on comparing texts within languages. Those variations are considerably fewer. The vast majority of these are accidental errors made by [[scribe]]s, and are easily identified as such: [[Haplography|an omitted word]], [[Homoioteleuton|a duplicate line]], a misspelling, a rearrangement of words. Some variations involve apparently intentional changes, which often make more difficult a determination of whether they were corrections from better exemplars, [[harmonization]]s between readings, or ideologically motivated.{{sfn|Ehrman|2004}} Variants are listed in critical editions of the text, the most important of which is the [[Novum Testamentum Graece]], which is the basis for most modern translations. For over 250 years, Christian scholars have argued that no textual variant affects key Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Daniel |date=3 June 2004 |url=https://bible.org/article/majority-text-and-original-text-are-they-identical |title=The Majority Text and the Original Text: Are They Identical? |access-date=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;c.f.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3055">The '''Center for Tropical Forest Science''', or CTFS, is a consortium of forest researchers who pursue long-term research on tree populations using comparable census method. The work developed out of a study of 50 hectares of forest on [[Barro Colorado Island]] in Panama begun in 1981. All individual trees larger than 1 centimeter in stem diameter were measured, mapped, and identified, which included 300 different species. This census has been repeated every five years since, most recently in 2010.

A total of 30 research institutions have now carried out parallel censuses of large forest plots. There are four such large-scale census projects in [[Africa]], nine in [[Latin America]], and 25 in [[Asia]]. Moreover, the census program has been expanded to include temperate and subtropical forests in [[China]]. Approximately 4.5 million individual trees of 8500 species are being monitored.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctfs.si.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scientific research reports on tree species [[Biodiversity|diversity]], [[range (biology)|distribution]], [[life expectancy|life span]], and growth rates have been published based on these plots.

CTFS is directed out of the [[Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute]] in [[Panama City]], Panama. Researchers and institutions in 14 other countries participate in the network.

The forest plots include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctfs.si.edu/plots/summary/ |title=Plots Summary |date= |work= |publisher= Center for Tropical Forest Science |accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2294">'''Commensurability''' is the property of two [[orbit]]ing objects, such as [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|satellites]], or [[asteroid]]s, whose [[orbital period]]s are in a [[rational number|rational]] [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]].

Examples include the 2:3 commensurability between the orbital periods of [[Neptune]] and [[Pluto]],&lt;ref name=Williams1971/&gt; the 3:4 commensurability between the orbital periods of the [[Saturn]]ian satellites [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] and [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]],&lt;ref name=Bevilacqua1980/&gt; the orbital periods associated with the [[Kirkwood gap]]s in the [[asteroid belt]] relative to that of [[Jupiter]],&lt;ref name=Moons1996/&gt; and the 2:1 commensurability between [[Gliese 876 b]] and [[Gliese 876 c]].

Commensurabilities are normally the result of an [[orbital resonance]], rather than being due to coincidence.

'''''Corpus Mysticum: Essai sur L'Eucharistie et l’Église au moyen âge''''' was a book written by [[Henri de Lubac]], published in [[Paris]] in 1944. The book aimed to, in de Lubac's words, retrieve the doctrine that "the Church makes the [[eucharist]] and the eucharist makes the church".&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''Twentieth-Century Catholic Theologians'' (2007), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book traces patristic and medieval uses of the Latin phrase ''corpus mysticum'' ("mystical body"). In de Lubac's time, especially as evidenced in [[Pope Pius XII]]'s 1943 encyclical ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]'', this phrase was typically used to refer to the Church as the "mystical body" of Christ.

From his historical study, however, de Lubac argued that the phrase ''corpus mysticum'' referred initially to Christ's ''eucharistic'' body, and not to the visible Church as an institution. This association had been lost in the late medieval period. De Lubac argued that it was important to recover the pre-modern understanding of ''corpus mysticum'', according to which Christ should be regarded as mystically present and at work where and when the eucharist was being celebrated.&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''Twentieth-Century Catholic Theologians'' (2007), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

De Lubac's argument did not have great immediate impact, but was hugely influential in the eucharistic ecclesiology developed (or rehabilitated) at [[Vatican II]].

'''Direct Visual Feedback''' is a method of training used in both practical and rehabilitative settings where the attention of the trainee is tied to an external visual cue in reference to the particular [[:wikt:movement|movement]], motor function or [[exercise]] that is being performed by the trainee. 

The principle to [[Biofeedback|Bio-Feedback]] is very similar to DVF.  Bio-Feedback, which is a process that enables an individual to learn how to change physiological activity for the purposes of improving health and performance by receiving rapid feedback from precise instruments which are measuring physiological activity such as [[Neural oscillation|brainwave]]s, heart function, [[breathing]], muscle activity, and skin temperature. 

Direct Visual Feedback's method applies more directly to improving exterior [[physical health]] and performance. Instead of using technically advanced [[measuring instrument]]s for feedback, DVF relies on the human eye. One method that has been used to test DVF is by placing a [[laser beam]] on the hand and connecting it to a monitor, when the trainee raises his arm from waist height to shoulder height he is focused on the external reference showing exactly what path the arm took from point A(waist height) to point B(shoulder height). Studies have shown that not only is a higher level of performance often achieved faster with an external rather than an internal attention focus, but the skill is retained better.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9403">'''Dualistic Petri nets''' (dPNs) are a process-class variant of [[Petri net]]s.
Like Petri nets in general and many related formalisms and notations, they are used to describe and analyze [[process architecture]].


==Process Modeling with dPNs ==
A simple, yet powerful way to model [[process architecture]] is using the dualistic extension of Petri nets called dualistic Petri nets (dPNs).&lt;ref&gt;Dawis, E. P., J. F. Dawis, Wei-Pin Koo (2001).  Architecture of Computer-based Systems using Dualistic Petri Nets.  Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, 2001 IEEE International Conference on Volume 3, 2001 Page(s):1554 - 1558 vol.3&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Petri net]] (PN) is a graphical, bipartite modeling language that intuitively and mathematically represent theoretical relationships of moving objects in a network of interconnected constructs.  Classical Place/Transition PNs can represent theoretical processes, where the movement of objects implies their transformation, but is too absolute to be pragmatic in representing real-world processes.  The real world is dualistic in nature and process is a dualistic phenomenon, this can not be easily represented using a digital-type modeling system.  Instead, dualistic extensions to Place/Transition PNs have been introduced and used successfully in modeling the architecture of computer-based systems&lt;ref&gt;Dawis, E. P. (2001).  Architecture of an SS7 Protocol Stack on a Broadband Switch Platform using Dualistic Petri Nets.  Communications, Computers and signal Processing, 2001. PACRIM. 2001 IEEE Pacific Rim Conference on Volume 1, 2001 Page(s):323 - 326 vol.1&lt;/ref&gt; and business processes.

:[[Image:DPNetSim.gif|frame|none|Animation of a Dualistic Petri Net Simulation: Rectangles = Transformations, Ovals = Places]]

Among the distinctions of dPNs from classical PNs is space and time (due to energy use) in both the place construct and transformation construct.  This results in the simulation effect of '''marked transformations''' that allow for the explicit representation of parallel processing, multiprocessing, and the implicit representation of deterioration of objects – all unique to dualistic Petri nets.

==Architecture==
Besides a propensity to modeling dualistic real-world behavior, PNs also offer a way to manage complex process systems hierarchically.  Using classical PN construction rules, Petri nets of Petri nets can be built and a hierarchical conception of a complex process system can be studied.  This structure of hierarchical abstraction is the heart of [[process architecture]]
===Bottom-Up: Starting with the manifested process===
Dualistic Petri nets are capable of modeling any process system at its manifested level.  When [[reverse engineering]] a manifested process, dPNs have a one-to-one correspondence of dPN construct to any manifested process piece, that is, it is [[isomorphic]] to the implementation language of the manifested process.  For example, several lines of software code could be represented by one dPN transformation construct.  Once the manifested process is completely represented by a network of dPNs, small, well-coupled groups of dPN constructs can be lumped together to form higher level dPN constructs – creating  a network of dPNs at a higher level of hierarchical abstraction.  Each level of abstraction is consistent with its adjacent levels of abstraction and the rules governing them at each level are the exactly the same because PN abstractions are [[homomorphic]].  Now the process design can be considered at various levels of abstraction as deemed appropriate by the process architect, allowing for studies in its dynamic behavior and performance.

A typical use of reverse engineering using dPNs in the business world is in the documentation of processes for quality certification against standards like [[ISO 9000]].  In this case, dPNs are used to model pieces of the business process, which are then combined to form an overall [[enterprise architecture]].  The process system can be studied to determine each piece's capability and show where risks occur.  Requirements are then reverse-engineered and applied at corresponding dPN constructs.  Trouble spot processes can be identified and slated for [[Business process reengineering|reengineering]].  The overall dPN map not only gives quality entities the necessary information about a business's current process, but it also gives the process architect a blue print from which to manage and [[kaizen|improve]] said processes.  This is a major portion of [[quality engineering]].
===Top-down: From Idea to Implementation===
dPN modeling of a new process system starts at a high level of hierarchical abstraction.  To design a complex process system, such as a sophisticated hardware component or a major project, the process architect must first define the problem space.  Since the problem space is itself a process system, dPNs can be used for its modeling.  Abstract dPNs that are yet to be implemented are specified within the context of the problem space.  These constructs define the solution space within its context network.  It is now up to the process architect to traverse down the hierarchical abstraction dimension, proposing new process designs for the solution space in an iterative manner until specifying the actual implementation in the specific implementation language.

This method for designing a complex process system is reflected in the general software development methodology known as the [[waterfall model]].  Actually, this method is not well-suited for the  development of complex software without adjusting it to handle the step-wise decomposition of the process architecture.  This decomposition occurs entirely within the domain of dPNs from the problem space context model down to the final mapping of the implementation language.
===Process Structure===
Whether a dPN hierarchical network map was created from the bottom up or from the top down, it shows the structure of the process system.  Complex process systems, such as large [[computer program]]s, will have several layers of hierarchical abstraction.  At the top of the structure is one process represented by a couple of dPN constructs.  Each subsequent layer below this process is the decomposition of the dPN constructs made up of more dPNs that are in turn decomposed.  The “parent” dPN of a set of decomposed dPNs has associated with it requirements that apply to the decomposed network.  These requirements were determined by studying the parent dPN's '''suprastructure''' or the hierarchical structure ''above'' the construct.  The decomposed “children” dPNs form the '''[[infrastructure]]''' or the hierarchical structure ''below'' the parent dPN.

:[[Image:DPNetStruct.gif|frame|none|Animation of a dPNet-modeled Process Architecture]]

In complex computer design, [[Requirements analysis|requirements are generated]] and infrastructures proposed.  Chosen infrastructures are then further decomposed by determining the new constructs' requirements and decomposing them further in this iterative fashion until the dPNs are decomposed into the implementation language of software or hardware specification.  The final hierarchical dPN map documents the architectural decisions that were accepted and a specification is in place that can be used to maintain the system's future evolution.

In [[business processes]], process requirements are [[policies]] that must be fulfilled by acceptable procedures.  Complex procedures can be specified by simpler procedures.  Since business processes are processes, dPNs are an ideal modeling language for them – especially when considering complex business processes like [[logistics]].

==Conclusion==
The entire network of dualistic Petri nets becomes the architecture specification of the process system.  If the problem and solution space are entirely in software, it is known as [[software architecture]].  If the problem and solution space are business processes, it is known as [[enterprise architecture]].  If the problem and solution space are networked equipment, it is known as [[network architecture]].  What is important to each of these applications and to any other process system of varying complexity is that the hierarchical map of the system's structure created by the network of dPNs allows the process architect to study the behavior and performance of the system, keeps architectural design decisions documented, and organizes process requirements along the architectural structure.

'''Ecological economics''' (also called '''eco-economics''', '''ecolonomy''' or '''bioeconomics''' of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen]]) is both a [[transdisciplinary]] and an [[interdisciplinary]] field of academic research addressing the interdependence and [[coevolution]] of human [[economy|economies]] and natural [[ecosystem]]s, both intertemporally and spatially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Anastasios Xepapadeas |year=2008 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/search_results?q=ecological+economics&amp;edition=current&amp;button_search=GO |title=Ecological economics |work=[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]] 2nd Edition |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan }}&lt;/ref&gt; By treating the economy as a subsystem of Earth's larger ecosystem, and by emphasizing the preservation of [[natural capital]], the field of '''ecological economics''' is differentiated from [[environmental economics]], which is the [[mainstream economics|mainstream economic]] analysis of the environment.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Environmental_and_ecological_economics Lead Author: Robert Nadeau Article Topics: Ecological economics and Environmental economics Last Updated: August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh (2001).

Ecological economics was founded in the 1980s as a modern discipline on the works of and interactions between various European and American academics (see the section on [[#History and development|History and development]] below). The related field of [[Green economy|green economics]] is, in general, a more politically applied form of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Paehlke|Paehlke R.]] (1995).

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and [[sustainable development]] guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber.

==History and development==
The antecedents of ecological economics can be traced back to the [[Romantics]] of the 19th century as well as some [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] political economists of that era. Concerns over population were expressed by [[Thomas Malthus]], while [[John Stuart Mill]] predicted the [[Steady-state economy #John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state|desirability of the ''stationary state'' of an economy]]. Mill thereby anticipated later insights of modern ecological economists, but without having had their experience of the social and ecological costs of the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]]. In 1880, [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] economist [[Sergei Podolinsky]] attempted to theorize a [[labor theory of value]] based on [[embodied energy]]; his work was read and critiqued by [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellamy Foster|first1=John|first2=Paul|last2=Burkett|title=Ecological Economics and Classical Marxism: The "Podolinsky Business" Reconsidered|journal=Organization &amp; Environment|date=March 2004|volume=Vol. 17, No. 1|pages=32-60|url=http://johnbellamyfoster.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/07/OandE-2004-Foster-Burkett-32-60.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The debate on energy in economic systems can also be traced back to [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel prize]]-winning [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Frederick Soddy]] (1877–1956). In his book ''[[Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt]]'' (1926), Soddy criticized the prevailing belief of the economy as a perpetual motion machine, capable of generating infinite wealth—a criticism expanded upon by later ecological economists such as Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/opinion/12zencey.html Zencey, Eric. (2009, April 12). Op-ed. ''New York Times'', p. WK9.] Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgescu-Roegen, who would later mentor Herman Daly at [[Vanderbilt University]], provided ecological economics with a modern conceptual framework based on the material and energy flows of economic production and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. His ''magnum opus'', ''[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|The Entropy Law and the Economic Process]]'' (1971), is credited by Daly as a fundamental text of the field, alongside Soddy's ''Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process. |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key concepts of what is now ecological economics are evident in the writings of [[Kenneth Boulding]] and [[E.F. Schumacher]], whose book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]] &amp;ndash; A Study of Economics as if People Mattered'' (1973) was published just a few years before the first edition of [[Herman Daly]]'s comprehensive and persuasive ''[[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|Steady-State Economics]]'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E.F. 1973.

The first organized meetings of ecological economists occurred in the 1980s. These began in 1982, at the instigation of Lois Banner,&lt;ref&gt;Røpke, I. (2004) The early history of modern ecological economics. Ecological Economics 50(3-4): 293-314.&lt;/ref&gt; with a meeting held in Sweden (including [[Robert Costanza]], [[Herman Daly]], [[Charles A S Hall|Charles Hall]], Bruce Hannon, [[H.T. Odum]], and David Pimentel).&lt;ref name=EarlyHistory/&gt; Most were ecosystem ecologists or mainstream environmental economists, with the exception of Daly. In 1987, Daly and Costanza edited an issue of ''Ecological Modeling'' to test the waters. A book entitled ''Ecological Economics'', by [[Joan Martinez Alier|Juan Martinez-Alier]], was published later that year.&lt;ref name=EarlyHistory&gt;Costanza R. (2003).

[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2 |Natural resources flow through the economy and end up as waste and pollution]]

A simple [[circular flow of income]] diagram is replaced in ecological economics by a more complex flow diagram reflecting the input of solar energy, which sustains natural inputs and environmental services which are then used as units of [[Production (economics)|production]]. Once consumed, natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste. The potential of an environment to provide services and materials is referred to as an "environment's source function", and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources. The "sink function" describes an environment's ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution: when waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function, long-term damage occurs.&lt;ref name=Harris2006&gt;Harris J. (2006). ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} Some persistent pollutants, such as some organic pollutants and nuclear waste are absorbed very slowly or not at all; ecological economists emphasize minimizing "cumulative pollutants".&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|28}} Pollutants affect human health and the health of the ecosystem.

The economic value of natural capital and [[ecosystem services]] is accepted by mainstream environmental economics, but is emphasized as especially important in ecological economics. Ecological economists may begin by estimating how to maintain a stable environment before assessing the cost in dollar terms.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|9}} Ecological economist [[Robert Costanza]] led an attempted valuation of the global ecosystem in 1997.

The open oceans, continental shelves, and estuaries had the highest total value, and the highest per-hectare values went to estuaries, swamps/floodplains, and seagrass/algae beds. The work was criticized by articles in ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]'' Volume 25, Issue 1, but the critics acknowledged the positive potential for economic valuation of the global ecosystem.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|129}}

The Earth's [[carrying capacity]] is a central issue in ecological economics. Early economists such as [[Thomas Malthus]] pointed out the finite carrying capacity of the earth, which was also central to the MIT study ''[[Limits to Growth]]''. [[Diminishing returns]] suggest that productivity increases will slow if major technological progress is not made. Food production may become a problem, as [[erosion]], an impending [[water crisis]], and [[soil salinity]] (from [[irrigation]]) reduce the productivity of agriculture. Ecological economists argue that [[industrial agriculture]], which exacerbates these problems, is not [[sustainable agriculture]], and are generally inclined favorably to [[organic farming]], which also reduces the output of carbon.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|26}}

Since [[animal]]s are higher on the [[trophic level]], they are less efficient sources of food energy. Reduced consumption of meat would reduce the demand for food, but as nations develop, they tend to adopt high-meat diets similar to that of the United States.

[[Global warming]] is now widely acknowledged as a major issue, with all national scientific academies [[scientific opinion on climate change|expressing agreement]] on the importance of the issue. As the population growth intensifies and energy demand increases, the world faces an [[energy crisis]]. Some economists and scientists forecast a global ecological crisis if energy use is not contained &amp;ndash; the [[Stern report]] is an example. The disagreement has sparked a vigorous debate on issue of [[discounting]] and intergenerational equity.

== Ethics ==
{{See also|Environmental ethics}}{{Renewable energy sources}}

[[Mainstream economics]] has attempted to become a value-free '[[hard and soft science|hard science]]', but ecological economists argue that value-free economics is generally not realistic. Ecological economics is more willing to entertain alternative conceptions of [[utility]], [[efficiency]], and [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefits]] such as positional analysis or multi-criteria analysis. Ecological economics is typically viewed as economics for [[sustainable development]],&lt;ref&gt;Soderbaum P. (2004).

Internet Encyclopaedia of Ecological Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; and may have goals similar to [[green politics]].

=== Green economics ===
In international, regional, and national policy circles, the concept of the ''green economy'' grew in popularity as a response to the financial predicament at first then became a vehicle for growth and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bina|first=O.|date=2011|title=Promise and shortcomings of a green turn in recent policy responses to the ‘double crisis’|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/geo2.36|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=70|pages=2308–2316|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[https://www.unenvironment.org/explore-topics/green-economy United Nations Environment Program]'' (UNEP) defines a ‘green economy’ as one that focuses on the human aspects and natural influences and an economic order that can generate high-salary jobs. In 2011, its definition was further developed as the word ‘green’ is made to refer to an economy that is not only resourceful and well-organized but also impartial, guaranteeing an objective shift to an [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/126GER_synthesis_en.pdf economy that is low-carbon, resource-efficient, and socially-inclusive].

The ideas and studies regarding the green economy denote a fundamental shift for more effective, resourceful, environment-friendly and resource‐saving technologies that could lessen emissions and alleviate the adverse consequences of climate change, at the same time confront issues about resource exhaustion and grave environmental dilapidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janicke|first=M.|date=2012|title=‘Green growth’: from a growing eco‐industry to economic sustainability|url=|journal=Energy Policy|volume=28|pages=13-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an indispensable requirement and vital precondition to realizing sustainable development, the [http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/green_economy_in_action_eng.pdf Green Economy] adherents robustly promote good governance. To boost local investments and foreign ventures, it is crucial to have a constant and foreseeable macroeconomic atmosphere. Likewise, such an environment will also need to be transparent and accountable. In the absence of a substantial and solid governance structure, the prospect of shifting towards a sustainable development route would be insignificant. In achieving a green economy, competent institutions and governance systems are vital in guaranteeing the efficient execution of strategies, guidelines, campaigns, and programmes. 

Shifting to a Green Economy demands a fresh mindset and an innovative outlook of doing business. It likewise necessitates new capacities, skills set from labor and professionals who can competently function across sectors, and able to work as effective components within multi-disciplinary teams. To achieve this goal, vocational training packages must be developed with focus on greening the sectors. Simultaneously, the educational system needs to be assessed as well in order to fit in the environmental and social considerations of various disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2012.

=== Green politics ===

== Schools of thought ==
Various competing schools of thought exist in the field. Some are close to resource and environmental economics while others are far more heterodox in outlook. An example of the latter is the ''European Society for Ecological Economics''.  An example of the former is the Swedish ''Beijer International Institute of Ecological Economics.'' [[Clive Spash]] has argued for the classification of the ecological economics movement, and more generally work by different economic schools on the environment, into three main categories.  These are the mainstream new resource economists, the new environmental pragmatists,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spash_NEP_2009_EV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the more radical social ecological economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clivespash.org/2011_Spash_AJES_Social_Ecol_Econ.pdf |title=Spash, C.L.

== Differentiation from mainstream schools ==
Some ecological economists prioritise adding natural capital to the typical [[capital asset]] analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These ecological economists then use tools from [[mathematical economics]] as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the [[precautionary principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Costanza R. (1989). What is ecological economics? ''Ecological Economics'' '''1''':1-7. [http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Costanza_EE_1989.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

The most cogent example of how the different theories treat similar assets is [[tropical rainforest]] ecosystems, most obviously the Yasuni region of [[Ecuador]].  While this area has substantial deposits of [[bitumen]] it is also one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and some estimates establish it has over 200 undiscovered medical substances in its genomes - most of which would be destroyed by logging the forest or mining the bitumen.  Effectively, the [[instructional capital]] of the genomes is undervalued by analyses which view the rainforest primarily as a source of wood, oil/tar and perhaps food. Increasingly the [[carbon credit]] for leaving the extremely carbon-intensive ("dirty") bitumen in the ground is also valued - the government of Ecuador set a price of US$350M for an oil lease with the intent of selling it to someone committed to never exercising it at all and instead preserving the rainforest.

While this natural capital and ecosystems services approach has proven popular amongst many it has also been contested as failing to address the underlying problems with mainstream economics, growth, market capitalism and monetary valuation of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Alier, J., 1994. Ecological economics and ecosocialism, in: O'Connor, M. (Ed.), Is Capitalism Sustainable? Guilford Press, New York, pp. 23-36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spash, C.L., Clayton, A.M.H., 1997.

Ecological Economics 25, 57-60&lt;/ref&gt;  Critiques concern the need to create a more meaningful relationship with Nature and the non-human world than evident in the instrumentalism of shallow ecology and the environmental economists [[commodification]] of everything external to the market system.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, J.F., 1993.

== Topics ==
Among the topics addressed by ecological economics are methodology, allocation of resources, weak versus strong sustainability, energy economics, energy accounting and balance, environmental services, cost shifting, and modeling.

=== Methodology ===
{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Laws of thermodynamics]]}}
A primary objective of ecological economics (EE) is to ground economic thinking and practice in physical reality, especially in the laws of physics (particularly the [[laws of thermodynamics]]) and in knowledge of biological systems.  It accepts as a goal the improvement of human well-being through development, and seeks to ensure achievement of this through planning for the sustainable development of ecosystems and societies. Of course the terms development and sustainable development are far from lacking controversy. [[Richard B. Norgaard]] argues traditional economics has hi-jacked the development terminology in his book ''Development Betrayed''.&lt;ref&gt;Norgaard, R. B. (1994) Development Betrayed: The End of Progress and a Coevolutionary Revisioning of the Future. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-being in ecological economics is also differentiated from welfare as found in mainstream economics and the 'new welfare economics' from the 1930s which informs resource and environmental economics.  This entails a limited preference utilitarian conception of value i.e., Nature is valuable to our economies, that is because people will pay for its services such as clean air, clean water, encounters with wilderness, etc.

Ecological economics is distinguishable from [[neoclassical economics]] primarily by its assertion that the economy is embedded within an environmental system. Ecology deals with the energy and matter transactions of life and the Earth, and the human economy is by definition contained within this system. Ecological economists argue that [[neoclassical economics]] has ignored the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy.

The neoclassical view ignores much of what the natural sciences have taught us about the contributions of nature to the creation of wealth e.g., the planetary endowment of scarce matter and energy, along with the complex and biologically diverse ecosystems that provide goods and [[ecosystem services]] directly to human communities: micro- and macro-climate regulation, water recycling, water purification, storm water regulation, waste absorption, food and medicine production, pollination, protection from solar and cosmic radiation, the view of a starry night sky, etc.

There has then been a move to regard such things as [[natural capital]] and ecosystems functions as goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Daily, G.C. 1997. ''Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems''. Washington, D.C.: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. 2005. ''Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Biodiversity Synthesis''. Washington, D.C.: World Resources Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this is far from uncontroversial within ecology or ecological economics due to the potential for narrowing down values to those found in mainstream economics and the danger of merely regarding Nature as a commodity.  This has been referred to as ecologists 'selling out on Nature'.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, D. J. (2006) Selling out on nature. Nature 443(7): 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;  There is then a concern that ecological economics has failed to learn from the extensive literature in [[environmental ethics]] about how to structure a plural value system.

=== Allocation of resources ===
[[File:Uneconomic Growth diagram.jpg|thumb|The marginal costs of a growing economy may gradually exceed the marginal benefits, however measured.]]
[[Resource economics|Resource]] and [[neoclassical economics]] focus primarily on the efficient allocation of resources and less on the two other problems of importance to ecological economics: [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] ([[equity (economics)|equity]]), and the scale of the economy relative to the ecosystems upon which it relies.&lt;ref name="Daly"&gt;Daly, H. and Farley, J. 2004. ''Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications''. Washington: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological economics makes a clear distinction between growth (quantitative increase in economic output) and development (qualitative improvement of the [[quality of life]]), while arguing that [[neoclassical economics]] confuses the two. Ecological economists point out that beyond modest levels, increased per-capita [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] (the typical economic measure of "standard of living") may not always lead to improvement in human well-being, but may have harmful effects on the environment and broader societal well-being. This situation is sometimes referred to as [[uneconomic growth]] (see diagram above).

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

Ecological economics challenges the conventional approach towards natural resources, claiming that it undervalues natural capital by considering it as interchangeable with human-made capital—labor and technology.

The impending depletion of natural resources and increase of climate-changing greenhouse gasses should motivate us to examine how political, economic and social policies can benefit from alternative energy. Shifting dependence on fossil fuels with specific interest within just one of the above-mentioned factors easily benefits at least one other. For instance, photo voltaic (or solar) panels have a 15% efficiency when absorbing the sun's energy, but its construction demand has increased 120% within both commercial and residential properties. Additionally, this construction has led to a roughly 30% increase in work demands (Chen).

The potential for the substitution of man-made capital for natural capital is an important debate in ecological economics and the economics of sustainability.
There is a continuum of views among economists between the strongly neoclassical positions of [[Robert Solow]] and [[Martin Weitzman]], at one extreme and the [[Pessimism #Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimists']], notably [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Herman Daly]], at the other.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U. 2007. On the practical limits of substitution. Ecological Economics 61: 115-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economists tend to maintain that man-made capital can, in principle, replace all types of natural capital.  This is known as the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|weak sustainability]] view, essentially that every technology can be improved upon or replaced by innovation, and that there is a substitute for any and all scarce materials.

At the other extreme, the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|strong sustainability]] view argues that the stock of natural resources and ecological functions are irreplaceable.  From the premises of strong sustainability, it follows that [[economic policy]] has a [[fiduciary]] responsibility to the greater ecological world, and that sustainable development must therefore take a different approach to valuing natural resources and ecological functions.

Recently, Stanislav Shmelev developed a new methodology for the assessment of progress at the macro scale based on multi-criteria methods, which allows consideration of different perspectives, including strong and weak sustainability or conservationists vs industrialists and aims to search for a 'middle way' by providing a strong neo-Keynesian economic push without putting excessive pressure on the natural resources, including water or producing emissions, both directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Shmelev, S.E. 2012. Ecological Economics. Sustainability in Practice, Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy economics ===
[[File:Cost and exergy for heating energy in Finland.jpg|thumb|275px|Exergy analysis can be performed to find connections between economic value and the physical world.

{{Main article|Energy economics}}
A key concept of energy economics is [[net energy gain]], which recognizes that all energy requires energy to produce.  To be useful the energy return on energy invested (''[[EROEI]]'') has to be greater than one.  The net energy gain from production coal, oil and gas has declined over time as the easiest to produce sources have been most heavily depleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Energy and Resource Quality: The ecology of the Economic Process |last1=Hall |first1=Charles A.S. |authorlink=

Ecological economics generally rejects the view of [[energy economics]] that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on [[biodiversity]] and [[creativity]] - or natural capital and [[individual capital]], in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of [[uneconomic growth]] and [[quality of life]]. Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge that much of what is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this.

[[Thermoeconomics]] is based on the proposition that the role of energy in [[biological evolution]] should be defined and understood through the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but also in terms of such economic criteria as [[productivity]], [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter A. Corning]] 1 *, Stephen J. Kline. (2000). [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/71007254/ABSTRACT Thermodynamics, information and life revisited, Part II: Thermoeconomics and Control information ] Systems Research and Behavioral Science, Apr. 07, Volume 15, Issue 6, Pages 453 – 482&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Corning|Corning, P.]] (2002). “[http://www.complexsystems.org/abstracts/thermoec.html Thermoeconomics – Beyond the Second Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922072349/http://www.complexsystems.org/abstracts/thermoec.html |date=2008-09-22 }}” – source: www.complexsystems.org&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, thermoeconomics is often discussed in the field of ecological economics, which itself is related to the fields of sustainability and sustainable development.

[[Exergy]] analysis is performed in the field of [[industrial ecology]] to use energy more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exergy.se/goran/thesis/ |title=Exergy - a useful concept |author=Wall, Göran |publisher=Exergy.se |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''exergy'', was coined by [[Zoran Rant]] in 1956, but the concept was developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]]. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, ecological economics, [[systems ecology]], and [[energetics]].

=== Energy accounting and balance ===
{{See also|Net energy gain}}

An [[Energy accounting|energy balance]] can be used to track energy through a system, and is a very useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts, using the First and Second laws of [[thermodynamics]], to determine how much energy is needed at each point in a system, and in what form that energy is a cost in various environmental issues.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Cutler" /&gt; --&gt; The energy accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus [[work done]], and transformations within the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |title=Environmental Decision making, Science and Technology |publisher=Telstar.ote.cmu.edu |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have written and speculated on different aspects of energy accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Stabile, Donald R. "Veblen and the Political Economy of the Engineer: the radical thinker and engineering leaders came to technocratic ideas at the same time," ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology (45:1) 1986, 43-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecosystem services and their valuation ===
{{see also|Ecosystem valuation|Price of life}}
Ecological economists agree that ecosystems produce enormous flows of goods and services to human beings, playing a key role in producing well-being. At the same time, there is intense debate about how and when to place values on these benefits&lt;ref&gt; Farley, Joshua. "Ecosystem services: The economics debate." Ecosystem services 1.1 (2012): 40-49. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2012.07.002 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kallis, Giorgos, Erik Gómez-Baggethun, and Christos Zografos. "To value or not to value? That is not the question." Ecological economics 94 (2013): 97-105. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2013.07.002&lt;/ref&gt;.

A study was carried out by Costanza and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Costanza, R. |author2=d'Arge, R. |author3=de Groot, R. |author4=Farber, S. |author5=Grasso, M. |author6=Hannon, B. |author7=Naeem, S. |author8=Limburg, K. |author9=Paruelo, J. |author10=O'Neill, R.V. |author11=Raskin, R. |author12=Sutton, P. |author13=and van den Belt, M. |year=1997 |title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital |journal=Nature |volume=387 |issue=6630 |pages=253–260 |url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |doi=10.1038/387253a0 |bibcode=1997Natur.387..253C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730185431/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the 'value' of the services provided by the environment. This was determined by averaging values obtained from a range of studies conducted in very specific context and then transferring these without regard to that context.  Dollar figures were averaged to a per hectare number for different types of ecosystem e.g. wetlands, oceans. A total was then produced which came out at 33 trillion US dollars (1997 values), more than twice the total [[GDP]] of the world at the time of the study.  This study was criticized by pre-ecological and even some [[Environmental economics|environmental economists]] - for being inconsistent with assumptions of [[financial capital]] [[valuation (finance)|valuation]] - and ecological economists - for being inconsistent with an ecological economics focus on biological and physical indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Norgaard, R.B.  |author2=Bode, C. |year=1998|title= Next, the value of God, and other reactions|journal=Ecological Economics|volume= 25|pages= 37–39|doi=10.1016/s0921-8009(98)00012-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The whole idea of treating ecosystems as goods and services to be valued in monetary terms remains controversial.  A common objection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brouwer|first1=Roy|title=Environmental value transfer: state of the art and future prospects|journal=Ecological Economics|date=January 2000|volume=32|issue=1|doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(99)00070-1|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800999000701|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gómez-Baggethun|first1=Erik|last2=de Groot|first2=Rudolf|last3=Lomas|first3=Pedro|last4=Montes|first4=Carlos|title=The history of ecosystem services in economic theory and practice: From early notions to markets and payment schemes|journal=Ecological Economics|date=1 April 2010|volume=69|issue=6|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.11.007|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180090900456X|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Farber|first1=Stephen|last2=Constanza|first2=Robert|last3=Wilson|first3=Matthew|title=Economic and ecological concepts for valuing ecosystem services|journal=Ecological Economics|date=June 2002|volume=41|issue=3|doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00088-5|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800902000885|accessdate=11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that life is precious or priceless, but this demonstrably degrades to it being worthless within cost-benefit analysis and other standard economic methods.  Reducing human bodies to financial values is a necessary part of mainstream economics and not always in the direct terms of [[insurance]] or [[wages]].  Economics, in principle, assumes that conflict is reduced by agreeing on voluntary contractual relations and prices instead of simply fighting or coercing or tricking others into providing goods or services.  In doing so, a provider agrees to surrender time and take bodily risks and other (reputation, financial) risks.  Ecosystems are no different from other bodies economically except insofar as they are far less replaceable than typical labour or commodities.

Despite these issues, many ecologists and conservation biologists are pursuing [[ecosystem valuation]]. [[Biodiversity]] measures in particular appear to be the most promising way to reconcile financial and ecological values, and there are many active efforts in this regard.  The growing field of [[biodiversity finance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialedge.org/features/opportunities/archive/2008/02/23/weblogentry.2008-02-20.6191038944 SocialEdge.org.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215083840/http://www.socialedge.org/features/opportunities/archive/2008/02/23/weblogentry.2008-02-20.6191038944 |date=2009-02-15 }} Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; began to emerge in 2008 in response to many specific proposals such as the Ecuadoran Yasuni proposal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sosyasuni.org/en/News/Ecuadors-Oil-Change-An-Exporters-Historic-Proposal.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621054850/http://www.sosyasuni.org/en/News/Ecuadors-Oil-Change-An-Exporters-Historic-Proposal.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/mm2007/092007/koenig.html Multinational Monitor, 9/2007.] Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or similar ones in the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]].  US news outlets treated the stories as a "threat"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/BUSINESS/12/10/ecuador.oil.ap/ |title=Ecuador threat to drill jungle oil|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218035742/http://www.cnn.com/2007/BUSINESS/12/10/ecuador.oil.ap/|archivedate=December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "drill a park"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3980994 |title=International News &amp;#124; World News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=4 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting a previously dominant view that NGOs and governments had the primary responsibility to protect ecosystems.  However [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]] and other commentators have recently argued that a guardianship/trustee/commons model is far more effective and takes the decisions out of the political realm.

Commodification of other ecological relations as in [[carbon credit]] and direct payments to farmers to preserve [[ecosystem services]] are likewise examples that enable private parties to play more direct roles protecting biodiversity, but is also controversial in ecological economics&lt;ref&gt;Spash, Clive L. "The brave new world of carbon trading." New Political Economy 15.2 (2010): 169-195 &lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] achieved near-universal agreement in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panna.org/jt/agAssessment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621193253/http://www.panna.org/jt/AgAssessment |archivedate=2008-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that such payments directly valuing ecosystem preservation and encouraging [[permaculture]] were the only practical way out of a food crisis.  The holdouts were all English-speaking countries that export [[GMO]]s and promote "[[free trade]]" agreements that facilitate their own control of the world transport network: The US, UK, Canada and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/04/17/do1702.xml | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=GM crops can save us from food shortages | first=Bill | last=Emmott | date=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Not 'externalities', but cost shifting ===

Ecological economics is founded upon the view that the neoclassical economics (NCE) assumption that environmental and community costs and benefits are mutually canceling ''"[[externalities]]"'' is not warranted. [[Joan Martinez Alier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Costanza|first=Robert|title=Getting Down to Earth: Practical Applications of Ecological Economics|year=1996|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1559635037|author2=Segura, Olman |author3=Olsen, Juan Martinez-Alier }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance shows that the bulk of consumers are automatically excluded from having an impact upon the prices of commodities, as these consumers are future generations who have not been born yet.  The assumptions behind future discounting, which assume that future goods will be cheaper than present goods, has been criticized by David Pearce&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, David "Blueprint for a Green Economy"&lt;/ref&gt; and by the recent [[Stern Report]] (although the Stern report itself does employ discounting and has been criticized for this and other reasons by ecological economists such as [[Clive Spash]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/EE2007_SpashonStern.pdf |title=Spash, C. L. (2007) The economics of climate change impacts à la Stern: Novel and nuanced or rhetorically restricted? Ecological Economics 63(4): 706-713 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202105133/http://www.clivespash.org/EE2007_SpashonStern.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning these externalities, some like the eco-businessman [[Paul Hawken]] argue an orthodox economic line that the only reason why goods produced unsustainably are usually cheaper than goods produced sustainably is due to a hidden subsidy, paid by the non-monetized human environment, community or future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul (1994) "The Ecology of Commerce" (Collins)&lt;/ref&gt;  These arguments are developed further by Hawken, Amory and Hunter Lovins to promote their vision of an environmental capitalist utopia in ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul; Amory and Hunter Lovins (2000) "Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution" (Back Bay Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, ecological economists, like Joan Martinez-Alier, appeal to a different line of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Alier, Joan (2002) The Environmentalism of the Poor: A Study of Ecological Conflicts and Valuation. Cheltenham, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than assuming some (new) form of capitalism is the best way forward, an older ecological economic critique questions the very idea of internalizing externalities as providing some corrective to the current system. The work by [[Karl William Kapp]] explains why the concept of "externality" is a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl William (1963) The Social Costs of Business Enterprise. Bombay/London, Asia Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the modern business enterprise operates on the basis of shifting costs onto others as normal practice to make profits.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl William (1971) Social costs, neo-classical economics and environmental planning. The Social Costs of Business Enterprise, 3rd edition. K. W. Kapp. Nottingham, Spokesman: 305-318&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Eisenstein]] has argued that this method of privatising profits while socialising the costs through externalities, passing the costs to the community, to the natural environment or to future generations is inherently destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein , Charles (2011), "Sacred Economics: Money, Gift and Society in an Age in Transition" (Evolver Editions)&lt;/ref&gt; As social ecological economist [[Clive Spash]] has noted, externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental and social problems are minor aberrations in an otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Spash, Clive L. |date= 16 July 2010 |title= The brave new world of carbon trading |journal= New Political Economy |volume= 15 |pages=169–195 |publisher= Taylor and Francis Online |issue= 2 |doi= 10.1080/13563460903556049 |url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19114/1/MPRA_paper_19114.pdf }} Copy also available at {{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/2010_Spash_Brave_New_World_NPE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510185658/http://clivespash.org/2010_Spash_Brave_New_World_NPE.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internalizing the odd externality does nothing to address the structural systemic problem and fails to recognize the all pervasive nature of these supposed 'externalities'.

=== Ecological-economic modeling ===

[[Mathematical model]]ing is a powerful tool that is used in ecological economic analysis. Various approaches and techniques include:&lt;ref&gt;Proops, J., and Safonov, P. (eds.) (2004), [http://www.e-elgar.co.uk/bookentry_main.lasso?id=2951 Modelling in Ecological Economics], Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faucheux, S., Pearce, D., and Proops, J. (eds.) (1995), Models of Sustainable Development, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary]], [[input/output model|input-output]], neo-Austrian modeling, [[entropy]] and [[thermodynamic]] models,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last = Chen|first = Jing|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[multi-criteria decision analysis|multi-criteria]], and [[agent-based]] modeling, the environmental [[Kuznets curve]], and [[Stock-Flow consistent model]] frameworks. [[System dynamics]] and [[GIS]] are techniques applied, among other, to spatial dynamic landscape simulation modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R., and Voinov, A. (eds.) (2004), Landscape Simulation Modeling.  A Spatially Explicit, Dynamic Approach, Springer-Verlag New-York, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Voinov|first=Alexey|title=Systems science and modeling for ecological economics|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0080886175|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Matrix accounting methods of Christian Felber provide a more sophisticated method for identifying "the common good"&lt;ref&gt;Felber, Christian (2012), "La economia del bien commun" (Duestro)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Assigning monetary value to natural resources such as [[biodiversity]], and the emergent [[ecosystem services]] is often viewed as a key process in influencing economic practices, policy, and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Mace GM. Whose conservation? Science (80- ). 2014 Sep 25;345(6204):1558–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta P. Nature’s role in sustaining economic development. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2010 Jan 12;365(1537):5–11.&lt;/ref&gt; While this idea is becoming more and more accepted among ecologists and conservationist, some argue that it is inherently false.
 
McCauley argues that ecological economics and the resulting ecosystem service based conservation can be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley D. Selling out on nature. Nature. 2006;443(September):7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes four main problems with this approach:

Firstly, it seems to be assumed that all ecosystem services are financially beneficial. This is undermined by a basic characteristic of ecosystems: they do not act specifically in favour of any single species. While certain services might be very useful to us, such as [[coastal protection]] from [[hurricanes]] by [[mangrove]]s for example, others might cause financial or personal harm, such as wolves hunting [[cattle]].&lt;ref&gt;Mech LD. The Challenge and Opportunity of Recovering Wolf Populations. Conserv Biol. 1995 Apr;9(2):270–8&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of Eco-systems makes it challenging to weigh up the value of a given species. Wolves play a critical role in regulating prey populations; the absence of such an apex predator in the Scottish Highlands has caused the over population of deer, preventing afforestation, which increases the risk of flooding and damage to property.
 
Secondly, allocating monetary value to nature would make its conservation reliant on markets that fluctuate. This can lead to [[devaluation]] of services that were previously considered financially beneficial. Such is the case of the bees in a forest near former [[coffee plantation]]s in Finca Santa Fe, [[Costa Rica]]. The [[pollination]] services were valued to over US$60,000 a year, but soon after the study, coffee prices dropped and the fields were replanted with pineapple.&lt;ref&gt;Ricketts TH, Daily GC, Ehrlich PR, Michener CD. Economic value of tropical forest to coffee production. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 24;101(34):12579–82&lt;/ref&gt; Pineapple does not require bees to be pollinated, so the value of their service dropped to zero.

Thirdly, conservation programmes for the sake of financial benefit underestimate human ingenuity to invent and replace ecosystem services by artificial means. McCauley argues that such proposals are deemed to have a short lifespan as the history of [[technology]] is about how Humanity developed [[artificial]] alternatives to nature’s services and with time passing the cost of such services tend to decrease. This would also lead to the devaluation of [[ecosystem services]].

Lastly, it should not be assumed that conserving ecosystems is always financially beneficial as opposed to alteration. In the case of the introduction of the [[Nile perch]] to [[Lake Victoria]], the ecological consequence was decimation of native [[fauna]]. However, this same event is praised by the local communities as they gain significant financial benefits from trading the fish.

McCauley argues that, for these reasons, trying to convince decision-makers to conserve nature for [[monetary]] reasons is not the path to be followed, and instead appealing to morality is the ultimate way to campaign for the protection of nature.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1548">'''''Esthesic''''' (UK ''aesthesic'') and '''''poietic''''' are terms used in [[semiotics]], the study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]], to describe perceptive and [[productive]] levels, processes, and analyses of [[symbol]]ic forms.

Like [[emic and etic|'emic' and 'etic']], both words appear to be derived from a suffix, ''-poietic'' (from {{lang-el|ποιητικός}} "creative") meaning productive or formative and ''-esthesic'' (from αἴσθησις "sense") being receptive or perceptive, in relation to the [[neutral level]]. The neutral level is the "trace" left behind, the physical or material creation of esthesic and poietic processes.

Thus, "a symbolic form... is not some 'intermediary' in a process of 'communication' that transmits the meaning intended by the author to the audience; it is instead the result of a complex ''process'' of creation (the poietic process) that has to do with the form as well as the content of the work; it is also the point of departure for a complex process of reception (the esthesic process) that ''reconstructs'' a 'message.'"

In the United States, '''Extended School Year''' ('''ESY''') services are designed to support a student with a [[disability]] as documented under the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) to maintain the academic, social/behavioral, communication, or other skills that they have learned as part of their [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) or [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 504]] accommodation plan. In order for a student to receive ESY services, the student must have evidenced substantial regression and recoupment issues during the previous IEP year and/or there is evidence of emerging skills which are often referred to as "breakthrough" skills. The focus of the services provided to the student as part of an ESY program are generally not upon learning new skills or "catching up" to grade level, but rather to provide practice to maintain previously acquired or learned skills. In some cases ESY is focused on continuing education for students whose rate of progress is insufficient to enable effective progress during the regular school year. If a student has received ESY services in previous years the student may not be eligible in future years as determinations for eligibility of ESY services are made annually by the IEP or 504 plan (which includes the parent and student of age 16 or older. NOTE: The mandatory age at which a student must be included varies by State but the Federal law states no later than age 16.)  

;(a) General.
# Under the re-authorization of IDEA, effective July 1, 2005, each public agency must ensure that extended school year services are available as necessary to provide [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] (FAPE), consistent with paragraph (a)(2).
# Extended school year services must be provided only if a child's IEP Team determines, on an individual basis, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.320 through 300.324, that the services are necessary for the provision of FAPE to the child.
# In implementing the requirements of this section, a public agency may not—
## Limit extended school year services to particular categories of disability; or
## Unilaterally limit the type, amount, or duration of those services.

;(b) Definition. 
As used in this section, the term extended school year services means special education and related services that--
# Are provided to a child with a disability—
## Beyond the normal school year of the public agency;
## In accordance with the child's IEP; and
## At no cost to the parents of the child; and
# Meet the standards of the [[State education agency]] (SEA).

'''Félix Thomas''' (1815-1875) was a French architect and painter born in [[Nantes]], France in 1815. After graduating from high school [[Lycée Georges Clemenceau (Nantes)|Clemenceau]], he studied  architecture and drafting at the Polytechnique before being admitted to the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|Beaux-Arts]] where he studied art under [[Louis-Hippolyte Lebas]]. His skills as a draftsman led him to work as project architect on several major archaeological excavations in Mesopotamia and Assyria during the early 1850s. Archaeological work provided opportunities for Thomas to demonstrate his skills as an illustrator and interpreter of historic architectural buildings and he co-authored an important early book on the archaeology of Nineveh in Assyria. He turned to full-time painting in his later life and is noted for works within the Orientalist genre.

==Career==

[[File:Gegenüsberstellung der Genien Nimrud-Khorsabad.jpg|thumb|Illustration from the book,''Nineveh and Assyria'' by Victor Place and Felix Thomas, 1867]]
Initially, Thomas trained as an architect or draftsman at l'Ecole Polytechnique (1834–35). He subsequently studied art at [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|Beaux-Arts]] where he was a pupil of [[Louis-Hippolyte Lebas]] who specialised in the history of architecture. In 1845, Thomas won the first [[Prix de Rome]] for a project in Architecture Cathedral. In 1849 he submitted 14 drawings of Neptune's Temple at Paestum which were very well received. In 1850, he travelled to Greece and on his way stopped at Constantinople and Smyrna.&lt;ref&gt;Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 923&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1850s, Thomas joined several archaeological expeditions in [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Assyria]] in his capacity as an architect. The first of these expeditions was led by [[Fulgence Fresnel]] and [[Julius Oppert]], commencing in 1851. Thomas was expected to describe the monuments and buildings that were discovered as well as to carry out quantity surveys, draw plans, prepare sketches and generally assist with documentation and drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, M.T., ''The Conquest of Assyria: Excavations in an Antique Land,'' Routledge, 2014, pp 307-08 and p. 315&lt;/ref&gt; He was also required to make casts and stampings of inscriptions, using the new and still secret procedure developed by Lattin de Laval. Due to ill-health, Thomas left Fresnel's Mesopotamian mission prematurely. In spite of that, he still managed to contribute twelve maps to the book of the expedition, ''Expedition Scientifique En Mésopotamie: Exécutée Par Ordre Du Gouvernement De 1851 À  1854'' by Julius Oppert.&lt;ref&gt;Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt;

After recovering from his illness, Thomas rejoined the archaeological team for the Assyrian excavation in 1852. The excavations, originally started by [[Paul-Emile Botta]] in 1843, were languishing, and the French government was determined to mount a large-scale operation in Assyria to showcase its dominance in the region. [[Victor Place]], the new French Consul in Mosul hired Thomas to join the expedition as the project designer. The mission which involved the excavation of the palace of the Assyrian King [[Sargon II]] in [[Dur-Sharrukin|Khorsabad]] (formerly [[Nineveh]]), would become the first systematic excavation of the site. Thomas made substantial contributions to the success of the excavation through his acute observations, the boldness of his reconstructions and the quality of his drawings which contributed to a rich understanding of the architecture of the Palace.&lt;ref&gt;Potts, D.T. (ed), ''A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East,'' Volume 1, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012, p. 51-52; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Assyrian antiquities were lost when the expedition's boat sank at Qnra, on the [[Tigris]], following an attack by local rebels in May, 1855. However, Thomas, who had left earlier, retained his sketches, plans and drawings which subsequently served to illustrate a pioneering text on Assyria and the Palace of King Sargon II entitled ''Ninevah and Assyria'', jointly authored by Victor Place and Felix Thomas in around 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Maisels, C.K., ''The Near East: Archaeology in the Cradle of Civilization,'' Routledge, 2005, pp 40-41; Tanner, J.P., “Ancient Babylon: From Gradual Demise to Archaeological Rediscovery,” ''Near East Archaeological Society Bulletin,'' Vol. 47 ,2002, pp 11-20; Library notes on ''Ninive et L'Assyrie, Consul General Avec Des Essais De Restauration,'' by Victor Place and Felix Thomas, [3 volume set],  Imprimerie Imperiale, Paris, 1857, Online: https://www.iberlibro.com/buscar-libro/primera-edicion/tapa-dura/precio-min/30/vi/960590/sortby/1/; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, Thomas became a major collaborator and co-author of an important archaeological treatise.

On his return to France, Thomas gave up archaeology and devoted himself to painting. He joined the studio of [[Charles Gleyre]] who became his mentor. His travels in Italy, Greece, and Turkey and the Middle East inspired his artistic vision and he began painting works in the Orientalist genre. He enjoyed only modest success in his second career as a painter. Towards the end of his life, he divided his time between his studio in Nantes and [[Pornic]] on the Atlantic coast.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, M.T., ''The Conquest of Assyria: Excavations in an Antique Land: 1840-1860,'' Psychology Press, 1996, p. 353; Pouillon, F., ''Dictionnaire des Orientalistes de Langue Française,'' KARTHALA, 2008, p. 924&lt;/ref&gt; The Baron de Girardot, in a book dedicated to him, said about him, "Modest to a fault, withdrawn and lonely, he painted for him." &lt;ref&gt;M. de Girardot, ''Felix Thomas, grand Prix de Rome Architecte, Peintre, Graveur, Sculpteur,'' Nantes, 1875&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas died in Nantes in April 1875.

The discipline of '''forensic epidemiology (FE)''' is a hybrid of principles and practices common to both [[forensic medicine]] and [[epidemiology]]. FE is directed at filling the gap between clinical judgment and epidemiologic data for determinations of causality in civil [[lawsuits]] and criminal prosecution and defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freeman|first1=Michael|last2=Zeegers|first2=Maurice|title=Forensic Epidemiology: Principles and Practices|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780124045842|url=http://store.elsevier.com/product.jsp?isbn=9780124045842}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koehler|first=Steven A.|last2=Freeman|first2=Michael D.|date=2014-06-01|title=Forensic epidemiology: a method for investigating and quantifying specific causation|journal=Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology|volume=10|issue=2|pages=217–222|doi=10.1007/s12024-013-9513-8|issn=1556-2891|pmid=24272789}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Michael D.|last2=Rossignol|first2=Annette M.|last3=Hand|first3=Michael L.|date=2009-02-01|title=Applied forensic epidemiology: the Bayesian evaluation of forensic evidence in vehicular homicide investigation|journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine|volume=16|issue=2|pages=83–92|doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2008.08.017|issn=1752-928X|pmid=19135003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Michael D.|last2=Rossignol|first2=Annette M.|last3=Hand|first3=Michael L.|date=2008-07-01|title=Forensic Epidemiology: a systematic approach to probabilistic determinations in disputed matters|journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine|volume=15|issue=5|pages=281–290|doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2007.12.009|issn=1752-928X|pmid=18511002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forensic epidemiologists formulate [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] probabilistic conclusions about the type and quantity of causal association between an antecedent harmful exposure and an injury or disease outcome in both populations and individuals. The conclusions resulting from an FE analysis can support legal decision-making regarding guilt or innocence in criminal actions, and provide an evidentiary support for findings of [[causation (law)|causal association]] in civil actions.

Applications of forensic epidemiologic principles are found in a wide variety of types of civil litigation, including cases of medical negligence, toxic or mass tort, pharmaceutical adverse events, medical device and consumer product failures, traffic crash-related injury and death, person identification and life expectancy.

== History of FE ==
The term Forensic Epidemiology was first associated with the investigation of bioterrorism in 1999, and coined by Dr. Ken Alibek, the former chief deputy of the Soviet bioweapons program. The scope of FE at that time was confined to the investigation of epidemics that were potentially man-made. After the US Anthrax attacks of 2001 the CDC defined forensic epidemiology as a means of investigating possible acts of bioterrorism.

At the present time FE is more widely known and described as the systematic application of epidemiology to disputed issues of causation that are decided in (primarily) civil, but also criminal courts. The use of epidemiologic data and analysis as a basis for assessing general causation in US courts, particularly in toxic tort cases, has been described for more than 30 years, beginning with the investigation of the alleged relationship between exposure to the Swine Flu vaccine in 1976 and subsequent cases of Guillain–Barré syndrome.[http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/SciMan3D12.pdf/$file/SciMan3D12.pdf]

More recently FE has also been described as an evidence-based method of quantifying the probability of specific causation in individuals. The approach is particularly helpful when a clinical differential diagnosis approach to causation is disputed. Examples covering a wide variety of applications of FE are listed below under Examples of Investigative Questions Addressed by Forensic Epidemiologists.

The metric of a case-specific FE analysis of cause is the comparative risk ratio (CRR).  The CRR is a unique metric to FE; it allows for the comparison of probabilities applicable to the investigated circumstances of an individual injury or disease.  Because a CRR is based on the unique circumstances surrounding the injury or disease of an individual, it may or may not be derived from a population-based [[relative risk]] (RR) or [[odds ratio]] (OR). An example of an RR analysis that could be used as a CRR  is as follows: for an unbelted driver who was seriously injured in a traffic crash, an important causal question might be what role the failure to use a seat belt played in causing his injury. A relevant RR analysis would consist of the examination of the frequency of serious injury in 1000 randomly selected unbelted drivers exposed to a 20&amp;nbsp;mph frontal collision versus the frequency of serious injury in 1000 randomly selected restrained drivers exposed to the same collision severity and type. If the frequency of serious injury in the group exposed to the presumptive hazard (failure to use a seat belt) was 0.15 and the frequency in the unexposed (belted) group was 0.05, then the CRR would be the same thing as the RR of 0.15/0.05. The RR design of the analysis dictates that the populations that the numerator and denominator of the CRR  are substantially similar in all respects, with the exception of the exposure to the investigated hazard, which was the failure to use a seat belt in the example.

In some instances encountered in a legal setting, however, the numerator and denominator risk must be derived from dissimilar populations in order to fit the circumstances of an investigated injury or disease. In such a case the CRR cannot be derived from either an RR or OR. An example of such a situation occurs when the numerator is a per event risk, and the denominator is a per-time risk (also known as a cumulative risk). An example of this type of analysis would be the investigation of a pulmonary embolism (PE) that occurred a week after a patient sustained a lower extremity fracture in a traffic crash. Such complications often result from blood clots forming in the legs and then traveling to the lungs. If the patient had a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the lower extremities prior to the crash, then a CRR might consist of the comparison between the risk of a PE following a lower extremity fracture (a per event rate) and  the 1-week risk of PE in a patient with DVT (a time-dependent probability).

Another example of a CRR based on dissimilar populations is when there are only a limited number of potential causes to be compared. An example is the investigation of the cause of an adverse reaction in a person who took two different drugs at the same time, both of which could have caused the reaction (and which, for the example, do not interact with each other). In such a situation, the CRR applicable to the unique circumstances experienced by the individual could be estimated by comparing the adverse reaction rate for the two drugs.

=== Attributable Proportion Under the Exposed ===
The attributable proportion under the exposed (AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; ) is an indication of the proportion of patients who were exposed to the potential cause and got sick because of this exposure. It can only be used if the RR &gt;1 and can be calculated by [(RR-1)/RR X 100%]. When the CRR is based on an RR, these formulae also apply to the CRR. The result of the analysis, given as an RR, CRR, or AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; , meets the legal standard of what is “''[[Legal burden of proof|more likely true than not]]'',”  when the RR or CRR is &gt;2.0 (with a 95% confidence interval lower boundary of &gt;1.0), or the AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is &gt;50%. The AP&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is also known as the "''Probability of Causation'' (PC)" a term that is defined in the US Code of Federal Regulations ([https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/pdfs/42cfr81/42cfr81.pdf Federal Register / Vol. 67, No. 85 / Thursday, May 2, 2002 / Rules and Regulations p. 22297]) and elsewhere.

=== Causal Methodology ===
Analysis of causation, particularly for injury or other conditions with a relatively short latency period between exposure and outcome, is accomplished using a 3-step approach, as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freeman|first=Michael D.|last2=Centeno|first2=Christopher J.|last3=Kohles|first3=Sean S.|date=2009-10-01|title=A systematic approach to clinical determinations of causation in symptomatic spinal disk injury following motor vehicle crash trauma|journal=PM &amp; R: the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation|volume=1|issue=10|pages=951–956|doi=10.1016/j.pmrj.2009.07.009|issn=|pmid=19854423|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Plausibility: This first step addresses whether it is biologically ''possible'' for the injury event to have caused the condition (a.k.a. general causation), and follows a special application of the viewpoints set forth by Hill (see below). A finding of plausibility is unrelated to the ''frequency'' of the injury, because even if the injury occurs in only 1 in 100 or fewer cases of exposure to the event, it is still ''plausibly'' caused by the event. Plausibility is a relatively low hurdle to clear in a causal analysis, and is largely satisfied by the lack of evidence of ''implausibility'' of the relationship. Plausibility is often, but not necessarily, established with epidemiologic data or information.
# Temporality: This second step examines the clinical and other evidence of the timing between the onset of the symptoms of injury and the injury event, and must be satisfied to assess specific causation. First, it must be established that the sequence of the injury and the event is appropriate; the symptoms cannot be identically present prior to the event. Further, the onset of the symptoms of injury cannot be either too latent or insufficiently latent, depending on the nature of the exposure and outcome.
# Lack of a more probable alternative explanation: This final step examines the probability of the injury condition occurring at the same point in time in the individual, given what is known about the individual from the review of medical records and other evidence, but in the absence of the injury event (a.k.a. differential diagnosis). First, evidence of competing injury events must be evaluated, and compared for risk (often via analysis of epidemiologic data). Then, the likelihood of the condition occurring spontaneously must be assessed, given the known history of the individual.

==== United States Case Law on Injury Causation Methodology ====
The 3-step methodology was challenged in United States District Court for the District of Colorado in ''Etherton v Auto-Owners Insurance Company.''[https://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/colorado/codce/1:2010cv00892/118960/145] The defendant challenged, among other things, the reliability and fit of the methods described by the expert. After an extensive examination and discussion of the 3-step process used by the expert, the Court found that the methodology appropriately fit the specific facts of the case, and that a population-based (epidemiologic) approach was an appropriate part of the causal methodology. The Court denied the Defendant’s motion to strike the expert’s testimony in the order, which was entered on 3/3l/l4.

The Defendant appealed the ruling from the District Court, and in July 2016, the Tenth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the 3-step causal methodology as generally accepted and well established for assessing injury causation, under the [[Daubert standard]].  See ''Etherton v. Auto-Owners Insurance Company'', No. 14-1164 (10th Cir, 7/l9/l6)[https://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/14/14-1164.pdf].

==== The Hill Viewpoints ====
[[Biological plausibility|Plausibility]] of an investigated association can be assessed in an FE investigation, in part, via application of the [[Bradford Hill criteria|Hill criteria]], named for a 1965 publication by Sir Austin Bradford-Hill, in which he described nine “viewpoints” by which an association described in an epidemiologic study could be assessed for causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=A. B.|date=1965-05-01|title=THE ENVIRONMENT AND DISEASE: ASSOCIATION OR CAUSATION?|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=58|pages=295–300|issn=0035-9157|pmc=1898525|pmid=14283879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill declined to call his viewpoints “criteria”  lest they be considered a checklist for assessing causation. The term “ Hill criteria”  is used widely in the literature, however, and for convenience is used in the present discussion. Of the nine criteria, there are seven that have utility for assessing the plausibility of an investigated specific causal relationship, as follows:
* Coherence: A causal conclusion should not contradict present substantive knowledge. It should “ make sense”  given current knowledge
* Analogy: The results of a previously described causal relationship may be translatable to the circumstances of a current investigation
* Consistency: The repeated observation of the investigated relationship in different circumstances or across a number of studies lends strength to a causal inference
* Specificity: The degree to which the exposure is associated with a particular outcome
* Biological plausibility: The extent to which the observed association can be explained by known scientific principles
* Experiment: In some cases there may be evidence from randomized experiments (''i.e.'', drug trials)
* Dose response: The probability, frequency, or severity of the outcome increases with increased amount of exposure
[[File:Assessing the role of a confounder.png|thumb|The triangular relationship between exposure, outcome, and confounder. When investigating whether there is a causal relationship between an exposure and outcome of interest, the influence of extraneous variables needs to be taken into account. A confounder is defined as a concurrent cause of the outcome under investigation that is related to, but not a consequence of, the exposure of interest.]]
Subsequent authors have added the feature of [[Challenge–dechallenge–rechallenge|Challenge/ Dechallenge/ Rechallenge]] for circumstances when the exposure is repeated over time and there is the ability to observe the associated outcome response, as might occur with an adverse reaction to a medication. Additional considerations when assessing an association are the potential impact of [[confounding]] and [[Bias of an estimator|bias]] in the data, which can obscure a true relationship. Confounding refers to a situation in which an association between an exposure and outcome is all or partly the result of a factor that affects the outcome but is unaffected by the exposure. Bias refers to a form of error that may threaten the validity of a study by producing results that are systematically different from the true results. Two main categories of bias in epidemiologic studies are [[selection bias]], which occurs when study subjects are selected as a result of another unmeasured variable that is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest; and [[Information bias (epidemiology)|information bias]], which is systematic error in the assessment of a variable. While useful when assessing a previously unexplored association, there is no combination or minimal number of these criteria that must be met in order to conclude that a plausible relationship exists between a known exposure and an observed outcome.

In many FE investigations there is no need for a causal plausibility analysis if a general causal relationship is well established. In large part, plausibility of a relationship is entertained once implausibility has been rejected. The two remaining Hill criteria are temporality  and strength of association. While both criteria have utility in assessing specific causation, temporality is the feature of an association that must be present, at least with regard to sequence (''i.e.'', the exposure must precede the outcome), in order to consider a relationship causal. Temporal proximity can also be useful in some specific causation evaluations, as the closer the investigated exposure and the outcome are in time the less opportunity there is for an intervening cause to act. Another feature of temporality that may have a role in a specific causation evaluation is latency. An outcome may occur too soon or too long after an exposure to be considered causally related. As an example, some food borne illnesses must incubate for hours or days after ingestion, and thus an illness that begins directly following a meal, and which is later found to be caused by a food borne microorganism that requires &gt;12 h incubation, was not caused by the investigated meal, even if an investigation were to reveal the microorganism in the ingested food. Strength of association is the criterion that is used in general causation to assess the impact of the exposure on the population, and is often quantified in terms of RR. In a specific causation evaluation the strength of the association between the exposure and the outcome is quantified by the CRR, as described above.
[[File:Contingency table of test accuracy metrics.png|thumb|A contingency table, also called a crosstabulation, of possible test outcomes, and the associated equations for evaluating test accuracy.]]

=== Test Accuracy ===
Test accuracy investigation is a standard practice in clinical epidemiology. In this setting, a diagnostic test is scrutinized to determine by various measures how often a test result is correct. In FE the same principles are used to evaluate the accuracy of proposed tests leading to conclusions that are central to fact finder determinations of guilt or innocence in criminal investigations, and of causality in civil matters. The utility of a test is highly dependent on its accuracy, which is determined by a measure of how often a positive or negative test result truly represents the actual status that is being tested. For any test or criterion there are typically four possible results: (1) a true positive (TP), in which the test correctly identifies tested subjects with the condition of interest; (2) a true negative (TN), in which the test correctly identifies test subjects who do not have the condition of interest; (3) a false positive (FP), in which the test is positive even though condition is not present, and; (4) a false negative (FN) in which the test is negative even though the condition is present. Fig. 3.19 is a contingency table illustrating the relationships between test results and condition presence, as well as the following test accuracy parameters:
* [[Sensitivity and specificity|Sensitivity]] (the rate at which the test is positive when the condition is present) TP/(TP + FN)
* [[Sensitivity and specificity|Specificity]] (the rate at which the test is negative when the condition is absent) TN/(TN + FP)
* [[Positive and negative predictive values|Positive predictive value]] (the rate at which the condition is present when the test is positive) TP/(TP + FP)
* [[Positive and negative predictive values|Negative predictive value]] (the rate at which the condition is absent when the test is negative) TN/(TN + FN)

=== Bayesian Reasoning ===
Probability is used to characterize the degree of belief in the truth of an assertion. The basis for such a belief can be a physical system that produces outcomes at a rate that is uniform over time, such as a gaming device like a roulette wheel or a die. With such a system, the observer does not influence the outcome; a fair six-sided die that is rolled enough times will land on any one of its sides 1/6th of the time. An assertion of a probability based in a physical system is easily tested with sufficient randomized experimentation. Conversely, the basis for a high degree of belief in an asserted claim may be a personally held perspective that cannot be tested. This does not mean that the assertion is any less true than one that can be tested. As an example, one might truthfully assert that “if I eat a banana there is a high probability that it will make me nauseous” based upon experience unknown to anyone but one’s self. It is difficult to test such assertions, which are evaluated through collateral evidence of plausibility and analogy, often based on similar personal experience. In forensic settings, assertions of belief are often characterized as probabilities, that is, ''what is most likely'', for a given set of facts. For circumstances in which a variety of conditions exist that may modify or “ condition”  the probability of a particular outcome or scenario, a method of quantifying the relationship between the modifying conditions and the probability of the outcome employs [[Bayesian probability|Bayesian reasoning]], named for [[Bayes' theorem|Bayes’ Theorem]] or Law upon which the approach is based. Most simply stated, Bayes’ Law allows for a more precise quantification of the uncertainty in a given probability. As applied in a forensic setting, Bayes’ Law tells us what we want to know given what we do know. Although Bayes’  Law is known in forensic sciences primarily for its application to DNA evidence, a number of authors have described the use of Bayesian reasoning for other applications in forensic medicine, including identification and age estimation.

=== Post-test Probability and Positive Predictive Value ===
The [[Pre- and post-test probability|post-test probability]] is a highly useful Bayesian equation that allows for the calculation of the probability that a condition is present when the test is positive, conditioned by the pretest prevalence of the condition of interest. This equation is given in box to the right:
[[File:Post-test probability.png|thumb|Post-test probability equation]]
The equation results in a positive predictive value for a given pre-event or pretest prevalence. In a circumstance in which the pretest prevalence is considered “indifferent” the prevalence and (1-prevalence) values cancel out, and the calculation is a simplified to a positive predictive value.

==Examples of Investigative Questions Addressed by Forensic Epidemiologists==
* What is likelihood that the asbestos exposure that Mr X experienced during his employment at company Z caused his lung cancer?
* How likely is it that the DNA found on the forensic scene belongs to Mr X? What is the chance that you are wrong? Could you in your probability calculation take into account the other evidence that points towards the identification of Mr X?   
* Could you estimate the probability that the leg amputation of Mrs Y could have been prevented if the delay in diagnosis would not have occurred?
* How likely is it that the heart failure of Mrs Y was indeed caused by the side effect of this drug?
* What is the chance that the death that followed the administration of the opiate by 20 minutes was due to the drug and not to other (unknown) factors?
* What is the chance that Mr. X would have needed neck surgery when he did if he had not been in a minor traffic crash the prior month?
* How likely is it that the bladder cancer of Mrs Y was caused by passive smoking during her imprisonment given the fact that she was an ex-smoker herself?
* Which liability percentage is reasonable in the given circumstance?
* What would be the life expectancy of Mr X at the time of his death if the wrongful death not occurred?  
* How long is Mr X expected to survive, given his brain/ spinal cord injury, on a more probable than not basis?
* Given the medical and non-medical evidence at hand regarding the circumstances of this traffic crash, what is the probability that Mrs Y was the driver?
* Given the medical and non-medical evidence at hand regarding the circumstances of this car accident, what is the probability that Mr X was wearing a seat belt?
* What is the probability that Mrs Y’s need for surgery resulted from the crash, vs. that it would have occurred at the same time if the crash had not happened?

Created in 2006, the GHI was initially published by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) and [[Welthungerhilfe]]. In 2007, the Irish NGO [[Concern Worldwide]] also became a co-publisher.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2006-4|[4]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2007-5|[5]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2008-6|[6]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2009-7|[7]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2010-8|[8]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2011-9|[9]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2012-10|[10]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2013-11|[11]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2014-12|[12]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2015-13|[13]]][[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI2016-14|[14]]]&lt;/sup&gt; In 2018, the GHI was a joint project of Welthungerhilfe and Concern Worldwide, with IFPRI stepping aside from its involvement in the report. 

The 2018 Global Hunger Index (GHI) report—the 13th in the annual series—presents a multidimensional measure of national, regional, and global hunger by assigning a numerical score based on several aspects of hunger. It then ranks countries by GHI score and compares current scores with past results. The 2018 report shows that in many countries and in terms of the global average, hunger and undernutrition have declined since 2000; in some parts of the world, however, hunger and undernutrition persist or have even worsened. Since 2010, 16 countries have seen no change or an increase in their GHI levels. 

Besides presenting GHI scores, each year the GHI report includes an essay addressing one particular aspect of hunger. The 2018 report considers the issue of forced migration and hunger.

In previous years, topics included: 

* In 2010: Early childhood undernutrition among children younger than the age of two.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI-Summary2010-16|[16]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
* In 2011: Rising and more volatile food prices of the recent years and the effects these changes     have on hunger and malnutrition.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI-Summary2011-17|[17]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
* In 2012: Achieving food security and sustainable use of natural resources, when the natural     sources of food become increasingly scarce.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI-Summary2012-18|[18]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
* In 2013: Strengthening community resilience against undernutrition and malnutrition.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI-Summary2013-19|[19]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
* In 2014: Hidden hunger, a form of undernutrition characterized by micronutrient deficiencies.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-GHI-Summary2014-20|[20]]]&lt;/sup&gt;

* In 2016: Reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger by 2030.
* In 2017: The challenges of inequality and hunger. 

In addition to the yearly GHI, the [[India State Hunger Index|Hunger Index for the States of India]] (ISHI) was published in 2008&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-India-GHI2009-22|[22]]]&lt;/sup&gt; and the Sub-National Hunger Index for Ethiopia was published in 2009.&lt;sup&gt;[[Global Hunger Index#cite%20note-Ethiopia-GHI2009-23|[23]]]&lt;/sup&gt; 

An [http://www.globalhungerindex.org/map.html interactive map] allows users to visualize the data for different years and zoom into specific regions or countries.

== Calculation of the Index ==
The Index ranks countries on a 100-point scale, with 0 being the best score (no hunger) and 100 being the worst, although neither of these extremes is reached in practice. Values from 0 to 9.9 reflect low hunger, values from 10.0 to 19.9 reflect moderate hunger, values from 20.0 to 34.9 indicate serious hunger, values from 35.0 to 49.9 reflect alarming hunger, and values of 50.0 or more reflect extremely alarming hunger levels.&lt;ref name="GHI-Summary2016"&gt;von Grebmer, Klaus; Bernstein, Jill; Hossain, Naomi; Brown, Tracy; Prasai, Nilam; Yohannes, Yisehac; Patterson, Fraser; Sonntag, Andrea; Zimmermann, Sophia-Marie; Towey, Olive; and Foley, Connell. 2017.

Washington, D.C.; Bonn; and Dublin: International Food Policy Research Institute, Welthungerhilfe, and Concern Worldwide.&lt;/ref&gt;

The GHI combines 4 component indicators: 
1) the proportion of the undernourished as a percentage of the population; 
2) the proportion of children under the age of five suffering from [[wasting]];
3) the proportion of children under the age of five suffering from [[Stunted Growth|stunting]]; 
4) the [[child mortality|mortality rate of children]] under the age of five.&lt;ref group="GHI2016"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/cdmref/p15738coll2/id/130707/filename/130918.pdf#page=7 Chapter 1: The Concept of the Global Hunger Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

The data and projections used for the 2017 GHI are for the period from 2011 to 2016—the most recent available data for the four components of the GHI. The data on the proportion of undernourished come from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN ([[FAO]]) and include authors' estimates.&lt;ref name=FAO2016&gt;FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). 2016. Food Security Indicators
((Updated February 9, 2016). [http://faostat3.fao.org/download/D/*/E]. Rome.&lt;/ref&gt; Data on child wasting and stunting are collected from [[UNICEF]], the [[World Health Organization]], the [[World Bank]], [[WHO]], [http://www.dhsprogram.com MEASURE DHS], the Indian Ministry of Women and Child Development, and also include the authors’ own estimates.&lt;ref group="GHI2016"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/cdmref/p15738coll2/id/130707/filename/130918.pdf#page=9 Chapter 1: The Concept of the Global Hunger Index]&lt;/ref&gt; Data on child mortality are from the UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation.&lt;ref name="IGME2015"&gt;UN IGME (UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation). 2015.

== Global and regional trends ==
[[File:BK 2016 GHI ch02 fig01.png|thumb|right|300x300px|Regional Hunger Index Scores, GHI 2016]]Although the 2017 GHI shows long-term progress in the reduction of hunger worldwide, millions are still experiencing chronic hunger and any places are suffering acute food crises and even famine. The 2017 GHI overall score is 27 percent lower than the 2000 score. Of the 119 countries assessed in this year's report, one falls in the extremely alarming range on the GHI Severity Scale; 7 are in the alarming range; 44 in the serious range; and 24 in the moderate range. Only 43 countries have scores considered low.

The regions of the world struggling most with hunger are South Asia and Africa south of the Sahara, with scores in the serious range (30.9 and 29.4, respectively). The scores of East and Southeast Asia, the Near East and North Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States range from low to moderate (between 7.8 and 12.8). These averages conceal some troubling results within each region, however, including scores in the serious range for Tajikistan, Guatemala, Haiti, and Iraq, and alarming in the case of Yemen, as well as scores in the serious range for half of all countries in East and Southeast Asia, whose average benefits from China's low score of 7.5.

Because data on the prevalence of undernourishment and, in some cases, data or estimates on child stunting and child wasting were unavailable, 2017 GHI scores could not be calculated for 13 countries. Yet the countries with missing data may be the ones suffering most. Based on the available data and information from international organizations that specialize in hunger and undernutrition, 9 of the 13 countries that lack sufficient data for calculating 2017 GHI scores still raise significant concern—Burundi, Comoros, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Libya, Papua New Guinea, Somalia, South Sudan, and Syria.

&lt;small&gt;— = Data are not available or not presented. Some countries did not exist in their present borders in the given year or reference period.

Countries are ranked according to 2018 GHI scores. Countries that have identical 2018 scores are given the same ranking (for example, Bulgaria and the Slovak Republic are both ranked 16th). The following countries could not be included because of lack of data: Bahrain, Bhutan, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Moldova, Qatar, Somaliland, South Sudan, the Syrian Arab Republic, and Tajikistan.&lt;/small&gt;

== Focus of the GHI 2018: Forced Migration and Hunger == 

The essay in the 2018 GHI report examines forced migration and hunger—two closely intertwined challenges that affect some of the poorest and most conflict-ridden regions of the world. Globally, there are an estimated 68.5 million displaced people, including 40.0 million internally displaced people, 25.4 million refugees, and 3.1 million asylum seekers. For these people, hunger may be both a cause and a consequence of forced migration. Support for food-insecure displaced people needs to be improved in four key areas:
•	recognizing and addressing hunger and displacement as political problems;
•	adopting more holistic approaches to protracted displacement settings involving development support;
•	providing support to food-insecure displaced people in their regions of origin; and
•	recognizing that the resilience of displaced people is never entirely absent and should be the basis for providing support.

The 2018 Global Hunger Index report presents recommendations for providing a more effective and holistic response to forced migration and hunger. These include focusing on those countries and groups of people who need the most support, providing long-term solutions for displaced people, and engaging in greater responsibility sharing at an international level.

== Focus 2017: The Inequalities of Hunger ==
The 2017 highlights the uneven nature of progress made in reducing hunger worldwide and the ways in which inequalities of power lead to unequal nourishment.

Achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals’ aim of “leaving no one behind” demands approaches to hunger and malnutrition that are both more sensitive to their uneven distribution and more attuned to the power inequalities that intensify the effects of poverty and marginalization on malnutrition. The report emphasizes the importance of using power analysis to name all forms of power that keep people hungry and malnourished; the significance of designing interventions strategically focused on where power is exerted; the need to empower the hungry and malnourished to challenge and resist loss of control over the food they eat.

== Focus 2016: Getting to zero hunger ==
The 2016 Global Hunger Index (GHI) presents a multidimensional measure of national, regional, and global hunger, focusing on how the world can get to Zero Hunger by 2030.

The developing world has made substantial progress in reducing hunger since 2000. The 2016 GHI shows that the level of hunger in developing countries as a group has fallen by 29 percent. Yet this progress has been uneven, and great disparities in hunger continue to exist at the regional, national, and subnational levels.

The 2016 GHI emphasizes that the regions, countries, and populations most vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition have to be identified, so improvement can be targeted there, if the world community wants to seriously [[Sustainable Development Goals#The goals|Sustainable Development Goal 2]] on [[Hunger#Global initiatives to end hunger|ending hunger]] and achieving [[food security]].&lt;ref group="GHI2016"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/cdmref/p15738coll2/id/130707/filename/130918.pdf#page=28 Chapter 4: Policy Recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus 2015: Armed Conflict and Chronic Hunger==
The chapter on hunger and conflict shows that the time of the great famines with more than 1 million people dead is over. There is, however, a clear connection between armed conflict and severe hunger. Most of the countries scoring worst in the 2015 GHI, are experiencing armed conflict or have in recent years. Still, severe hunger exists also without conflict present as the cases of several countries in South Asia and Africa show.

Since 2005 and increase in armed conflict can be seen. Unless armed conflicts can be reduced there is little hope for overcoming hunger.&lt;ref group="GHI2015"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/cdmref/p15738coll2/id/129681/filename/129892.pdf#page=21 Chapter 3: Armed Conflict and the Challenge of Hunger: Is an End in Sight?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Focus of the GHI 2014: Hidden Hunger ==
Hidden hunger concerns over 200 million people worldwide. This [[micronutrient deficiency]] develops when humans do not take in enough micronutrients such as zinc, folate, iron and vitamins, or when their bodies cannot absorb them. Reasons include an unbalanced [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], a higher need for micronutrients (e.g. during pregnancy or while breast feeding) but also health issues related to sickness, infections or parasites.

The consequences for individuals can be devastating: these often include mental impairment, bad health, low productivity and death caused by sickness. In particular, [[child malnutrition|children]] are affected if they do not absorb enough micronutrients in the first 1000 days of their lives (beginning with conception).&lt;ref group="GHI2014"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ghi14.pdf#page=21 Chapter 3: Addressing the Challenge of Hidden Hunger]&lt;/ref&gt;

Micronutrient deficiencies are responsible for an estimated 1.1 million of the yearly 3.1 million death caused by undernutrition in children. Despite the magnitude of the problem, it is still not easy to get precise data on the spread of hidden hunger. Macronutrient and micronutrient deficiencies cause a loss in global productivity of 1.4 to 2.1 billion US Dollars per year.&lt;ref name=FAO2013&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. 2013 [http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3300e/i3300e.pdf The State of Food and Agriculture: Food Systems for Better Nutrition]. Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different measures exist to prevent hidden hunger. It is essential to ensure that humans maintain a diverse diet. The quality of produce is as important as the caloric input. This can be achieved by promoting the production of a wide variety of nutrient-rich plants and the creation of house gardens.

Other possible solutions are the [[Fortification|industrial enrichment]] of food or [[biofortification]] of feedplants (e.g. vitamin A rich sweet potatoes).
In the case of acute nutrient deficiency and in specific life phases, food supplements can be used. In particular, the addition of vitamin A leads to a better child survival rate.&lt;ref group="GHI2014"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ghi14.pdf#page=21 Chapter 3: Addressing the Challenge of Hidden Hunger]&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the situation concerning hidden hunger can only be improved when many measures intermesh. In addition to the direct measures described above, this includes the education and empowerment of women, the creation of better [[sanitation]] and adequate hygiene, and access to clean drinking water and health services.

== Focus of the GHI 2013: Resilience to build food and nutrition security ==
Many of the countries, in which the [[hunger]] situation is "alarming" or "extremely alarming", are particularly prone to crises: In the African [[Sahel]] people experience yearly droughts. On top of that, they have to deal with violent conflict and natural calamities. At the same time, the global context becomes more and more volatile ([[Great Recession|financial and economic crises]], [[2007–08 world food price crisis|food price crises]]).

The inability to cope with these crises leads to the destruction of many development successes that had been achieved over the years. In addition, people have even less resources to withstand the next shock or crises. 2.6 billion people in the world live with less than 2 USD per day. For them, a sickness in the family, crop failure after a drought or the interruption of [[remittances]] from relatives who live abroad can set in motion a downward spiral from which they cannot free themselves on their own.

It is therefore not enough to support people in emergencies and, once the crises is over, to start longer term development efforts. Instead, emergency and development assistance has to be conceptualized with the goal of increasing [[Psychological resilience|resilience]] of poor people against these shocks.

The Global Hunger Index differentiates three coping strategies. The lower the intensity of the crises, the less resources have to be used to cope with the consequences:&lt;ref group="GHI2013"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ghi13.pdf#page=21 Chapter 3: Understanding Resilience for Food and Nutrition Security]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Absorption: Skills or resources, which are used to reduce the impact of a crisis without changing the lifestyle (e.g. selling some livestock)
* Adaptation: Once the capacity to absorb is exhausted, steps are taken to adapt the lifestyle to the situation without making drastic changes (e.g. using drought-resistant seeds).
* Transformation: If the adaptation strategies do not suffice to deal with the negative impact of the crises, fundamental, longer lasting changes to life and behavior have to be made (e.g. nomadic tribes become sedentary and become farmers because they cannot keep their herds).

Based on this analysis the authors present several policy recommendations:&lt;ref group="GHI2013"&gt;[http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ghi13.pdf#page=49 Chapter 5: Policy Recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Overcoming the institutional, financial and conceptual boundaries between humanitarian aid and development assistance.
* Elimination of policies that undermine people's resilience. Using the Right to Food as a basis for the development of new policies.
* Implementation of multi-year, flexible programs, which are financed in a way that enables multi-sectoral approaches to overcome chronic food crises.
* Communicating that improving resilience is cost effective and improves food and nutrition security, especially in fragile contexts.
* Scientific monitoring and evaluation of measures and programs with the goal to increase resilience.
* Active involvement of the local population in the planning and implementation of resilience increasing programs.
* Improvement of food especially of mothers and children through nutrition-specific and sensitive interventions to avoid that short-term crises lead to nutrition-related problems late in life or across generations.

== Focus of the GHI 2012: Pressures on land, water and energy resources ==
Increasingly, Hunger is related to how we use land, water and energy. The growing scarcity of these resources puts more and more pressure on food security.
Several factors contribute to an increasing shortage of natural resources:&lt;ref group="GHI2012"&gt;Chapter 3: 'Sustainable food security under land, water, and energy stresses', [http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ghi12.pdf#page=25 pages 25-26]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Demographic change: The world population is expected to be over 9 billion by 2050. Additionally, more and more people live in cities. Urban populations feed themselves differently than inhabitants of rural areas; they tend to consume less staple foods and more meat and dairy products.
# Higher income and non-sustainable use of resources: As the global economy grows, wealthy people consume more food and goods, which have to be produced with a lot of water and energy. They can afford not to be efficient and wasteful in their use of resources.
# Bad policies and weak institutions: When policies, for example energy policy, are not tested for the consequences they have on the availability of land and water it can lead to failures. An example are the biofuel policies of industrialized countries: As corn and sugar are increasingly used for the production of fuels, there is less land and water for the production of food. 
Signs for an increasing scarcity of energy, land and water resources are for example: growing prices for food and energy, a massive increase of large-scale investment in arable land (so-called [[land grabbing]]), increasing degradation of arable land because of too intensive [[land use]] (for example, increasing [[desertification]]), increasing number of people, who live in regions with lowering ground water levels, and the loss of arable land as a consequence of [[climate change]].
The analysis of the global conditions lead the authors of the GHI 2012 to recommend several policy actions:&lt;ref name="GHI-Summary2012"&gt;IFPRI/ Welthungerhilfe/ Concern. 2012. [http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ib70.pdf 2012 Global Hunger Index]. Issue Brief No. 70. Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;
* Securing land and water rights
* Gradual lowering of subsidies
* Creation of a positive macroeconomic framework
* Investment in agriculture technology development to promote a more efficient use of land, water and energy
* Support for approaches, that lead to a more efficient use of land, water and energy along the whole value chain
* Preventing and overuse of natural resources through monitoring strategies for water, land and energy, and agricultural systems
* Improvement of the access to education for women and the strengthening of their reproductive rights to address demographic change
* Increase incomes, reduce social and economic inequality and promotion of sustainable lifestyles
* Climate change mitigation and adaptation through a reorientation of agriculture

== Focus of the GHI 2011: Rising and volatile food prices ==
The report cites 3 factors as the main reasons for high [[volatility (finance)|volatility]], or price changes, and price spikes of food:
* Use of the so-called [[biofuel]]s, promoted by high [[oil price]]s, [[subsidies]] in the United States (&lt;!-- p. 25, graph --&gt;over one third of the corn harvest of 2009 and 2010 respectively) and quota for biofuel in gasoline in the European Union, India and others.
* [[Extreme weather events]] as a result of [[Climate Change]]
* [[Future trading]] of agricultural commodities, for instance investments in fonds,{{Clarify|date=July 2013}} which are speculating on price changes of agricultural products (2003: 13 Bn US Dollar, 2008: 260 Bn US Dollar), as well as increasing [[trade volume]] of these goods.

Volatility and prices increases are worsened according to the report by the concentration of staple foods in a few countries and [[export restriction]]s of these goods, the historical low of worldwide [[cereal]] reserves and the lack of timely information on food products, reserves and price developments. Especially this lack of information can lead to overreactions in the markets. Moreover, seasonal limitations on production possibilities, limited land for agricultural production, limited access to fertilizers and water, as well as the increasing demand resulting from population growth, puts pressure on food prices.

According to the Global Hunger Index 2011 price trends show especially harsh consequences for poor and under-nourished people, because they are not capable to react to price spikes and price changes. Reactions, following these developments, can include: reduced calorie intake, no longer sending children to school, riskier income generation such as [[prostitution]], criminality, or searching landfills, and sending away household members, who cannot be fed anymore. In addition, the report sees an all-time high in the instability and unpredictability of food prices, which after decades of slight decrease, increasingly show price spikes (strong and short-term increase).&lt;ref group="GHI2011"&gt;Chapter 3: ''Combating Hunger in a World of High and Volatile Food Prices''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="GHI2011"&gt;Chapter 4: ''The Impacts of Food Price Spikes and Volatility at Local Levels'', [http://www.welthungerhilfe.de/fileadmin/media/pdf/WHI/WHI2011/WHI-2011_final.pdf#page=22 pages 20–41]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a national level, especially food importing countries (those with a negative food [[trade balance]], are affected by the changing prices.

== Focus of the GHI 2010: Early Childhood Under-nutrition ==

Under-nutrition among children has reached terrible levels. About 195 million children under the age of five in the developing world—about one in three children—are too small and thus underdeveloped. Nearly one in four children under age five—129 million—is underweight, and one in 10 is severely underweight. The problem of child under-nutrition is concentrated in a few countries and regions with more than 90 percent of stunted children living in Africa and Asia. 42% of the world's undernourished children live in India alone.

The evidence presented in the report&lt;ref name="Victora2008"&gt;Victora, C. G., L. Adair, C. Fall, P. C. Hallal, R. Martorell, L. Richter und H. Singh Sachdev for the Maternal and Child Undernutrition Study Group. 2008. Maternal and child undernutrition: Consequences for adult health and human capital. "The Lancet" 371 (9609): 340–57&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Victora2010"&gt;Victora, C. G., M. de Onis, P. C. Hallal, M. Blössner und R. Shrimpton. 2010. Worldwide timing of growth faltering: Revisiting implications for interventions. "Pediatrics" 125 (3): 473.
&lt;/ref&gt; shows that the window of opportunity for improving nutrition spans is the 1,000 days between conception and a child's second birthday (that is the period from -9 to +24 months). Children who are do not receive adequate nutrition during this period have increased risks to experiencing lifelong damage, including poor physical and cognitive development, poor health, and even early death. The consequences of malnutrition that occurred after 24 months of a child's life are by contrast largely reversible.&lt;ref name="GHI2010"&gt;IFPRI/ Concern/ Welthungerhilfe: [http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ghi10.pdf 2010 Global Hunger Index The challenge of hunger: Focus on the crisis of child undernutrition].

The '''H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering''' is a department in the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]'s [[Georgia Institute of Technology College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] dedicated to education and research in [[industrial engineering]]. The school is named after [[H. Milton Stewart]], a local philanthropist and successful businessman who formerly graduated from the BSIE undergraduate program. 

Unlike similar programs at other schools, the School of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Georgia Tech focuses on core disciplines for both Industrial Engineering (such as manufacturing and quality control) and Systems Engineering (such as global logistics and system optimization). ''[[US News &amp; World Report]]'' consistently ranks the program at number 1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2619">'''The Institute for High Energy Physics (Institut de Fisica d'Altes Energies, IFAE)''' of [[Barcelona]], [[Spain]], is a Public Consortium between the
[[Generalitat de Catalunya]] (Government of the Autonomous Community of [[Catalonia]]) and the
[[Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona]] (UAB). It was formally created on July 16, 1991,
by Act number 159/1991 of the Generalitat. As an organization it is independent from both the
UAB and the Generalitat, ruled by its own Statutes, and governed by a Governing Board.
It is located on the campus of UAB in Bellaterra, Barcelona.

The IFAE has its own Titular Personnel as well as Associated Personnel consisting on members
of the Physics Department of UAB working on Particle Physics. It has also an agreement with
Universitat de Barcelona (dated 8/7/1992) which also allows the faculty of that university
working on Particle Physics to be Associated Personnel of IFAE.

The IFAE is also adscribed to the UAB as a University Institute (Act number 231/1995 of the
Generalitat) which allows its members to teach in its Doctoral Programme in Physics, and thus
benefits from a productive symbiotic relationship with this major education and research institution.

The institute is dedicated to forefront experimental and theoretical research in the fields of
high energy physics and high energy astrophysics as well as in related technologies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11910">In studies of the [[public understanding of science]], the '''information deficit model''' (or simply '''deficit model''') or '''science literacy/knowledge deficit model''' attributes public scepticism or hostility to science and technology to a lack of understanding, resulting from a lack of information.  It is associated with a division between experts who have the information and non-experts who do not.  The model implies that communication should focus on improving the transfer of information from experts to non-experts.

==Deficit model of science communication==

The original term ‘deficit model’ was coined in the 1980s by [[social scientists]] studying the public communication of science. The purpose of the phrase was not to introduce a new mode of science communication but rather it was to characterise a widely held belief that underlies much of what is carried out in the name of such activity. 

There are two aspects to this belief. The first is the idea that public uncertainty and scepticism towards modern science including environmental issues and technology is caused primarily by a lack of sufficient knowledge about science and the relevant subjects. The second aspect relates to the idea that by providing the adequate information to overcome this lack of knowledge, also known as a ‘knowledge deficit’, the general [[public opinion]] will change and decide that the information provided on the environment and science as a whole is reliable and accurate.&lt;ref name="Dickson"&gt;Dickson, D. 2005. [http://www.scidev.net/global/communication/editorials/the-case-for-a-deficit-model-of-science-communic.html The Case for a ‘deficit model’ of science communication]. ''Science and Development Network''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists are often heard to complain that the general public does not understand science, and that the public needs to be educated. In the deficit model scientists assume that there is a knowledge deficit that can be ‘fixed’ by giving the public more information: scientists often assume that “given the facts (whatever they are), the public will happily support new technologies.”&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, S. 2009. [http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v4/n10/full/nnano.2009.278.html The new deficit model]. ''Nature Nanotechnology'' '''4''':609-611.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The deficit model, however, has been discredited by a wealth of literature that shows that simply giving more information to people does not necessarily change their views.&lt;ref&gt;Kearnes M., Macnaghten P. &amp; Wilsdon, J. Governing at the Nanoscale (Demos, 2006); available at &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/governingatthenanoscale |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214083000/http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/governingatthenanoscale |archivedate=2007-12-14 |df= }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This is partly because people want to feel that they have had their say (and have been heard) in any decision-making process, and partly because people make decisions based on a host of factors as well as the scientific ‘facts’. These factors include [[ethical]] and religious beliefs, in addition to culture, history and personal experience. This amounts to a kind of gut feeling, which scientific facts are unlikely to change. Put another way, people’s sense of risk extends beyond the purely scientific considerations of conventional risk analysis, and the deficit model marginalises these ‘[[externalities]]’. It is now widely accepted that the best alternative to deficit model thinking is to genuinely engage with the public and take these externalities into account.&lt;ref&gt;Boykoff, MT (2009), Creating a Climate for Change: Communicating Climate Change and Facilitating Social Change. Glob. Environ. Polit. 9 (2) 123-128&lt;/ref&gt;

The deficit model sees the general population as the receiver of information and scientific knowledge. The information they receive, through whatever medium, has been prearranged to inform them of information that the distributors believe to be in the public’s interest. Due to the recent growth of scientific research and subsequent discoveries, the deficit model suggests that this has led to a decrease in interest surrounding certain areas of science. This can be down to the public feeling overwhelmed with information and becomes uninterested, as it appears too much to take in. 

The deficit model of scientific understanding makes assumptions about the public’s knowledge. The model perceives them to be “blank slates” where their knowledge of scientific discourse and research is almost non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Jane and Miller, Steve (2000), Science in Public: Communication, Culture and Credibility, (London: Perseus)&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this is the knowledge deficit that needs to be informed by a reliable, knowledgeable and hierarchical scientific community in the form of simple commands and generic instructions. But the increase in new information systems such as the Internet and their ease of accessibility has led to a greater knowledge of scientific research and this is evident as the public’s understanding can be seen to be growing.{{Citation needed|reason=Can this statement be validated?|date=August 2017}} This is a good thing in terms of the members of the public that can actively increase their own knowledge base, decrease the knowledge deficit and assess the truth and validity of what [[mass media]] outlets and [[governments]] are telling them. This should enhance and increase the relationship between the passive “blank slates” of the public, with the minority of the population who hold the ‘knowledge surplus’.

===Evidence for a deficit affecting opinion===
A 420 meta-analysis of 193 studies sought to interpret the link between science knowledge and attitude towards science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allum|first1=Nick|author2=Sturgis P, Tabourazi D, Brunton-Smith I|title=Science knowledge and attitudes across cultures: a meta-analysis|journal=Public Understanding of Science|date=2008|volume=17|pages=35–54|doi=10.1177/0963662506070159}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studies included were taken using nonuniform methods across the world between 1989 and 2004 to provide a cross-cultural analysis. Broad and specific science knowledge and attitude categories were correlated. General science and general biology knowledge was gauged using questions similar to those by the [[National Science Foundation]] used to capture "civil scientific literacy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=J.D.|title=Scientific Literacy: a Conceptual and Empirical Review|journal=Dedalus|date=1983|volume=11|pages=29–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data on general science and biology knowledge was then compared with attitudes towards general science, nuclear power, genetic medicine, [[genetically modified food]], and environmental science. From the raw data, it was found that a small positive correlation exists between general science knowledge and attitude towards science, indicating that increased scientific knowledge is related to a favorable attitude towards a science topic, and that this was not related to socioeconomic or technologic status of a country, but rather the number of individuals enrolled in tertiary education. However, some studies have found that high levels of science knowledge may indicate highly positive and highly negative attitudes towards specific topics such as agriculture [[biotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Durant |first=J. |title=Biotechnology in Public: a Review of Recent Research|publisher=Science Museum Publications|date=1992|location=London|pages=28–41|author2=Martin, S Tait, J.|authorlink=Attitudes of Selected Public Groups in the UK to Biotechnology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus knowledge may be a predictor of the attitude strength and not necessarily if the attitude is positive or negative.

==The role of the media==

[[Mass media]] representations, ranging from news to entertainment, are critical links between the everyday realities of how people experience certain issues and the ways in which these are discussed at a distance between science, policy and public actors.&lt;ref name="Dickson"/&gt; Numerous studies show that the public frequently learn about science and more specifically issues such as climate change from the mass media. 

There is perceived to be a trend within much of the world’s media that a traditional commitment to report the full facts is and has given way to a more obvious, less reliable tendency to concentrate coverage on interpretations of the facts. This so-called ‘spin’ is reported by the world’s press under a combination of commercial and political pressure. This can be dangerous as it ‘fills’ the knowledge deficit and the unsuspecting public with sometimes unreliable, agenda promoting information. The subjects of anthropogenic [[global warming]] and [[climate change]] are at the forefront of this. However, in all cases it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate out the factual basis of what is being reported from the ‘spin’ that is exerted on the way a story is reported and presented.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;

The mass media is accessible to the vast numbers of the global population and ranging from entertainment, to news media, and spanning books, films, televisions, newspapers, radio, games and the Internet. More modern forms of communication and receiving of information have given the public a much wider and accessible format in which to gain knowledge themselves. 

The actual processes behind the communication and dissemination of information from the experts to the public may be far more complex and deep running than the deficit model suggests.

The knowledge deficit model is important for science communicators to know about. This is particularly important with respect to the concept of [[framing (social sciences)|framing]] when communicating information. Framing can be used to reduce the complexity of an issue, or to persuade audiences, and can play into the underlying religious beliefs, moral values, prior knowledge, and even trust in scientists or political individuals. Further, the transmission of scientific ideas and technological adoption may be strongly linked to the passage of information between easily influenced individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watts|first1=Duncan J. |author2=Dodds, P.S.|title=Influentials, Networks, and Public Opinion Formation|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=2007|volume=34|pages=441–458|doi=10.1086/518527}}&lt;/ref&gt; versus the widely accepted "two-step flow" theory where a few opinion leaders acted as intermediaries between mass media and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Eliju|author2=Lazersfeld, P.F.|title=Personal Influence; the Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communication|date=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreasing the knowledge deficit is a complicated task, but if we know how the general public thinks, or how they go about learning and interpreting new information, we can better communicate our message to them in the most unbiased, objective way possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Scheufele |first=Dietram |title=MESSAGES AND HEURISTICS: HOW AUDIENCES FORM ATTITUDES ABOUT EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES|location=Engaging Science: Thoughts, deeds, analysis and action|pages=21–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative models==
In contrast to the knowledge-deficit model is the [[low-information rationality]] model that states humans minimize costs associated with making decisions and forming attitudes, thereby avoiding developing in-depth understandings.

The '''Institute of Mathematics''' ([[Armenian language|Armenian]]: {{lang|hy|Մաթեմատիկայի Ինստիտուտ}}) is owned and operated by the [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]], located in [[Yerevan]].

==History==
The '''Institute of Mathematics of National Academy of Sciences of Armenia''' originated as the Section for Mathematics and Mechanics, created within the newly formed [[Armenian Academy of Sciences]] in 1944.  The section later developed into an Institute of Mathematics and Mechanics of Armenian Academy of Sciences, whose first Director was academician [[Artashes Shahinian]], known for his results in [[complex analysis]]. The Institute of Mathematics of Armenian Academy of Sciences separated from the latter Institute in 1971. The bearer of the office of the Director of Institute has been academician [[Mkhitar Djrbashian]] (1971-1989, 1989-1994 Honorary Director).

The academicians [[Sergey Mergelyan]], [[Norair Arakelian]], [[Alexandr Talalyan]], [[Raphayel Alexandrian]], [[Rouben V. Ambartzumian]] and [[Anry Nersesyan]] also have greatly influenced the formation of the scientific profile of the Institute and largely contributed to mathematics in general. In particular [[Rouben V. Ambartzumian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.3103/S1068362313010019?no-access=true |doi= 10.3103/S1068362313010019 |volume=48 |title= Academician R. V. Ambartzumian |journal= Journal of Contemporary Mathematical Analysis |pages= 1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is famous for his work in [[Stochastic geometry|Stochastic Geometry]] and [[Integral geometry|Integral Geometry]], where he created a new branch called Combinatorial Integral Geometry.&lt;ref&gt;1982 – R.V. Ambartzumian. ''Combinatorial Integral Geometry with Applications to Mathematical [[Stereology]]'', John Wiley, Chichester, NY&lt;/ref&gt; He has provided solutions to a number of classical problems in particular the solution to the Buffon Sylvester problem as well as the [[Hilbert's fourth problem#cite note-5|Hilbert's fourth problem]] in dimensions 2&lt;ref&gt;R. V. Ambartzumian. "A note on pseudo-metrics on the plane". ''Zeitschrift für Wahrscheinlichkeitstheorie und Verwandte Gebiete''. 1976, Volume 37, Issue 2, pp. 145-155&lt;/ref&gt; and 3.&lt;ref&gt;R. V. Ambartzumian. "Remarks on Combinatorics of Planes in Euclidean Three Dimensions". ''SOP Transactions on Applied Mathematics''. Volume 1, Number 2, pp. 29-43. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years, the investigations carried out in the Institute concentrated on [[complex analysis|Function Theory]]. Gradually the sphere of investigations expanded and now includes [[differential equations|Differential]] and [[integral equation|Integral]] Equations, [[Functional Analysis]], [[Probability Theory]] and [[Mathematical Statistics]].

==Journals==
The institute has a journal, ''[[Izvestia NAS RA Matematika]]''. The founder and the first Editor in Chief (1971–1990) of the journal was [[Mkhitar Djrbashian]]; under [[Rouben V. Ambartzumian]] Editor in Chief (1990 - 2010) the journal obtained international recognition and obtained an English version, ''[[Journal of Contemporary Mathematical Analysis]]'', published initially by Allerton Press, Inc. New York and later by [[Springer Science+Business Media]]. Journal covers a host of topics including: [[real analysis]] and [[complex analysis]]; [[approximation theory]], [[boundary value problem]]s; [[integral geometry]] and [[stochastic geometry]]; [[differential equations]]; [[probability]] and [[statistics]]; [[integral equations]]; [[algebra]].

==Directors, faculty and members==
At present the Institute has about 30 main researchers as well as a number of associate researchers from [[Yerevan State University]].

[[Norair Arakelian]] in 1970 (Nice) and [[Mkhitar Djrbashian]], [[Rouben V. Ambartzumian]] in 1974 (Vancouver) were invited speakers at the 
[[International Congresses of Mathematicians]].

Traditionally, an '''Islamic garden''' is a cool place of rest and reflection, and a reminder of [[Jannah|paradise]].  The [[Qur'an]] has many references to gardens, and the garden is used as an earthly analogue for the life in paradise which is promised to believers:

:''Allah has promised to the believing men and the believing women gardens, beneath which rivers flow, to abide in them, and goodly dwellings in gardens of perpetual abode; and best of all is Allah's goodly pleasure; that is the grand achievement'' (Qur'an 9.72)

There are surviving formal Islamic gardens in a wide zone extending from Spain and Morocco in the west to India in the east. Famous Islamic gardens include those of the [[Taj Mahal]] in India and the [[Generalife]] and [[Alhambra]] in Spain.

The general theme of a traditional Islamic garden is water and shade, not surprisingly since Islam came from and generally spread in a hot and arid climate.  Unlike English gardens, which are often designed for walking, Islamic gardens are intended for rest and contemplation.  For this reason, Islamic gardens usually include places for sitting.

==Types==
[[D. Fairchild Ruggles|Fairchild Ruggles]] refers to the universal nature of gardening, and the basic human needs it fulfills; the needs to cultivate, to master the wild landscape, and to bring order to it.  The spiritual aspects of gardening, according to this view, were a later development.  She further points out the classic formal garden, known as the [[Charbagh]] (or Chahar Bagh), is but one form which exists in the Islamic civilization; a civilization which has traditionally included peoples of many faiths and cultures.&lt;ref name="Ruggles, D. Fairchild 2008"&gt;[[D. Fairchild Ruggles|Ruggles, D. Fairchild]]. ''Islamic Gardens and Landscapes''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clifford A. Wright, an author on Mediterranean cuisine, describes different garden types for different purposes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cliffordawright.com/caw/food/entries/display.php/topic_id/29/id/53/|title=Did You Know: Food History - The Muslim Gardens of Paradise|website=www.cliffordawright.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The Muslims had different kinds of gardens serving different purposes. The bustan was the garden of the inner court of a house, a formal garden with pools and water channels. The jannah was an orchard with palms, oranges, and vines irrigated by canals. The rawdah referred in particular to the vegetable garden that produced foods for the cooks.}}

==Persian, Arabic and Byzantine influence==
After the Arab invasions of the 7th century CE, the traditional design of the [[Persian garden]] was used in the Islamic garden. [[Persian gardens]] after that time were traditionally enclosed by walls and were designed to represent [[Jannah|paradise]]; the Persian word for enclosed space is 'pairi-daeza.'   In the [[Charbagh]], or [[paradise garden]], four water canals typically carry water into a central pool or fountain, interpreted as the four rivers in paradise, filled with milk, honey, wine and water.&lt;ref name="Gardens of Islam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic Arts|url=http://islamispeace.org.uk/itm.php?id_top=27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014025728/http://islamispeace.org.uk/itm.php?id_top=27|dead-url=yes|archive-date=14 October 2007|website=Islamispeace.org.uk|publisher=Islamispeace.org.uk|accessdate=2 February 2018|date=14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yves-Marie Allain and Janine Christiany, ''L'Art des jardins en Europe,'' Citadelles &amp; Mazenod, Paris, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hellenistic]] influences are also apparent; the Western use of straight lines in the plan is blended with [[Sassanid]] ornamental plantations and fountains.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marie-Luise Gothein]], ''A History of Garden Art'', Diederichs, 1914, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surviving gardens==
Many of the gardens of Islamic civilization are lost to us today. While most others may retain their forms, the original plantings have been replaced with modern ones.&lt;ref name="Ruggles, D. Fairchild 2008"/&gt; The garden is a transient form of architectural art dependent upon the climate, and the resources available to those who care for it.

===Albania===
[[Evliya Çelebi]]'s 17th century CE [[Seyahatname]] (travel book) contains descriptions of Paradise Gardens around the towns of Berat and Elbasan, Albania. According to Dr. [[Robert Elsie]], an expert on Albanian culture, very few traces of the refined oriental culture of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] era remain here today.&lt;ref name="Elsie"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elsie|first1=Robert|title=Texts and Documents of Albanian History|url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts16-18/AH1670_1.html|website=Albanian History|accessdate=3 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705153855/http://www.albanianhistory.net/texts16-18/AH1670_1.html|archivedate=5 July 2011|quote=Extract from: Robert Dankoff and Robert Elsie (ed.): Evliya Çelebi in Albania and Adjacent Regions (Kosovo, Montenegro, Ohrid), Leiden 2000, p. 101 127, 161 193.

Elsie: Early Albania, a Reader of Historical Texts, 11th - 17th Centuries, Wiesbaden 2003, p. 195-218.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Çelebi describes the town of Berat:

{{quote|It is a huge open town, entirely outside the walls of the fortress. It is situated in a large area along the bank of the [...] river to the east and south of the upper fortress and is covered in vineyards, rose gardens and vegetable gardens. There are 5,000 one- and two-story stonework houses with red-tiled roofs. They are well built and attractive houses with gardens and are spread over seven verdant hills and valleys. Among them are over 100 splendid mansions with cisterns and fountains and an invigorating climate.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;}}

Çelebi describes the town of Elbasan:

{{quote|The open town outside the walls extends on all sides of the fortress to the foot of the hills at a distance of one hour's march. The prosperous and cheerful-looking mansions in the open town are adorned with beautiful vineyards, paradisiacal gardens and parks with their pavilions and galleries. They are two or three stories high, made of stonework and with tiled roofs. Each of them has a source of pure flowing water, a pool and a fountain with water spurting from jets. They are luxurious dwellings like those in the gardens of paradise.&lt;ref name="Elsie"/&gt;}}

===Algeria===
Dar al-Bahr, the Lake Palace, is situated on the southern end of [[Beni Hammad Fort]], a ruined fortified city which has remained uninhabited for 800 years.  Artifacts recovered from the site attest to a high degree of civilization. During its time, it was remarked upon by visitors for the nautical spectacles enacted in its large pool.  Surrounding the pool and the palace were terraces, courtyards and gardens.  Little is known of the details of these gardens, other than the lion motifs carved in their stone fountains.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, D. Fairchild. ''Islamic Gardens and Landscapes''. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2008, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Beni Hammad Fort is a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], noted as an "authentic picture of a fortified Muslim city."

===The Shalimar gardens===
The name Shalimar is thought to mean, among other things, "abode of bliss" or "light of the moon". There were originally three gardens with the name Shalimar: [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|one in Lahore, Pakistan]], [[Shalimar Bagh (Srinagar)|another in Jammu Kashmir]], India and finally one, located in Delhi, which has completely disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Sikander, Sattar. ''The Shalamar: A Typical Muslim Garden''. Environmental Design: Journal of the Islamic Environmental Design Research Centre 2, 1986, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shalimar Gardens, Lahore====
[[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens, Lahore]], was built by the governor of Lahore, with funds supplied by the [[Mughal empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Shah Jahan]], beginning in 1641 CE.  The water is supplied by a canal dug from the nearby Ravi river.  Built in the [[Mughal gardens|Mughal style]], it is surrounded by high walls with towers in the corners.  The inner face of the walls have traces of frescoes done in floral patterns.  The canal passes through the gardens, which are constructed on three separate terraces at different elevations.  The garden terraces are laid out in the traditional "paradise" motif of four channels converging on a central fountain, and cover a total of forty acres.&lt;ref&gt;Sikander, Sattar. ''The Shalamar: A Typical Muslim Garden''. Environmental Design: Journal of the Islamic Environmental Design Research Centre 2, 1986, pp. 24–29.&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20060214214014/http://archnet.org/library/pubdownloader/pdf/4883/doc/DPC0715.pdf]

===Andalusian Spain===
The garden was a common feature of homes in Arab Spain.  Andalusian designs emphasized privacy and coolness, with rooms opening onto a roofed, open corridor.  Next to this corridor, one would typically find a verdant patio garden complete with central fountain.&lt;ref&gt;Irving, T. B. ''The Falcon of Spain ''. Ashraf Press, 1962, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Al-Azhar park, Cairo===
[[Al-Azhar Park]] is a modern landmark in Cairo, Egypt. It is laid out along a central series of terraced, formal Islamic gardens.  Multicolored [[Mamluk]] stonework, fountains and [[Islamic geometric patterns]] are the predominating stylistic theme of the park.  It is listed as one of the world's sixty great public spaces by the [[Project for Public Spaces]] ([http://www.pps.org/ PPS]).&lt;ref name="PPS Sixty"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pps.org/info/gps/60places?referrer=gps_home |title=60 of the World's Great Places - Project for Public Spaces |accessdate=2006-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206002657/http://www.pps.org/info/gps/60places?referrer=gps_home |archivedate=2006-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Language assessment''' or '''language testing''' is a field of study under the umbrella of [[applied linguistics]].  Its main focus is the assessment of [[first language|first]], [[second language|second]] or other language in the school, college, or university context; assessment of language use in the workplace; and assessment of language in the immigration, citizenship, and [[right of asylum|asylum]] contexts.&lt;ref name="HornbergerSpringer"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hornberger, Nancy H. |author2=Shohamy, Elana   |title=Encyclopedia of Language and Education, Volume 7: Language Testing and Assessment |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-387-32875-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assessment may include listening, speaking, reading, [[Writing Assessment|writing]], an integration of two or more of these skills, or other constructs of language ability. Equal weight may be placed on knowledge (understanding how the language works theoretically) and [[language proficiency|proficiency]] (ability to use the language practically), or greater weight may be given to one aspect or the other.&lt;ref&gt;http://hrd.apec.org/index.php/Language_Assessment {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722201227/http://hrd.apec.org/index.php/Language_Assessment |date=22 July 2009 }} APEC Human Resources Development Working Group&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{globalize|date=August 2008}}
The earliest works in language assessment in the United States date back to the 1950s to the pioneering studies and test created by [[Robert Lado]] and David Harris. The earliest large scale assessments in the United States were referred to as the Michigan Tests, developed by the English Language Institute at the University of Michigan, now known as [[CaMLA]], and the [[TOEFL|''Test of English as a Foreign Language'' (TOEFL)]]  developed by [[Educational Testing Service]] (ETS), Princeton, New Jersey.

The English Language Institute  at the University of Michigan ([[CaMLA]]) was established in 1941 and was the first of its kind in the United States. Charles Fries, Director of ELI, and [[Robert Lado]], Director of Testing at ELI, were determined to put foreign language teaching and testing on a "scientific" footing. The first test launched in 1946 was the ''Lado Test of Aural Comprehension''. Approximately 10 years later, a full suite of tests had been assembled: "an English language test battery", which was administered to incoming foreign students at Michigan and other universities. Today this is known at the Michigan English Language Assessment Battery ([[MELAB]]). In 1953, the ELI also developed the ECPE (Examination for the Certificate of Proficiency in English) exam, under contract to the United States Information Agency, for use abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Swales, J. 2013, Other Floors, Other Voices: A Textography of A Small University Building, https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xsz5AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT68&amp;lpg=PT68&amp;dq=1953+ECPE+melab+1985&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BiM65G_a-8&amp;sig=xoxFrmJibs4ScLuNpc8Z3ftocX4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lbKBVaGQK6iR7Aa2r4PoCA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=1953%20ECPE%20melab%201985&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

TOEFL was launched in 1961 and was designed to assess the English language ability of students applying for admission to U.S. and Canadian colleges and universities.  This test, which is used widely around the world, is still in use although it is now only available in the internet-based format (now called the TOEFL iBT&lt;ref&gt;About the TOEFL iBT Test http://www.ets.org/toefl/ibt/about/ Retrieved 23 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;).

Many tests from other companies, universities and agencies compete for this market: [[International Test of English Proficiency|iTEP]] (International Test of English Proficiency), the [[Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program]] (CELPIP) Test, the [[Pearson Language Tests|Pearson Language Test]]'s ''[[Pearson Test of English Academic|Pearson Test of English]]'' (PTE), [[CaMLA]] assessments including the ''Michigan English Language Assessment Battery'' ([[MELAB]]) and [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]], [[the British Council]] and the Australian IDP's ''[[International English Language Testing System]]'' (IELTS). In the United States, non-profit and other organizations such as the [[Center for Applied Linguistics]], Washington, D.C. and [[Language Testing International]], White Plains, NY have developed language tests that are used by many public and private agencies.  Many universities too, like the [[UCLA|University of California, Los Angeles]], [[Teachers College|Teachers College, Columbia University]], and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign]], have developed English (and other) language tests to assess the abilities of their students and teaching assistants. These language assessments are generally known as proficiency or achievement assessments. Other modern English language tests developed include ''The General English Proficiency Test (GEPT)'' in Taiwan, the ''College English Test'' in China, and the ''STEP Eiken'' in Japan. New technology has also made a presence in the field: Versant's English and Dutch assessments use phone technology to record the speaking and automated scoring of their speaking tests, and the ETS is currently experimenting with automated scoring of their [[Writing Assessment|writing tests]].

== Organizations ==
The International Language Testing Association (ILTA) is one of the many organizations that organizes conferences, workshops, and a public forum for the discussion of important matters. ILTA's major annual conference is the Language Testing Research Colloquium.  ILTA's Lifetime Achievement Award winners include: [[Carol Chapelle]] (USA), Alan Davies (UK), Lyle Bachman (USA), Bernard Spolsky (Israel), John Clark (USA), Charles Alderson (UK) and Elana Shohamy (Israel).

Educational Testing Service, Princeton, New Jersey, the home of the TOEFL, offers an annual outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award in Second or Foreign Language and the [[University of Cambridge]], UK, also offers an annual outstanding master's degree Award in second language testing. In Europe, there are two organizations: the Association of Language Testers of Europe (ALTE) and the European Association for Language Testing and Assessment (EALTA). All of these associations have developed [[code of ethics|Codes of Ethics]] and Practice that all language assessment professionals are expected to adhere to.

== Annual conferences ==
There are many annual conferences on general or specific topics. Among the most important conferences is ILTA's official conference: the '''Language Testing Research Colloquium''' (LTRC), which has been held every year since 1978. In the last few years, it has been held in different parts of the world: Temecula, California, USA (2004); Ottawa, Canada (2005); Melbourne, Australia (2006); Barcelona, Spain (2007); Hangzhou, China (2008), and Denver, Colorado (2009), Cambridge, UK (2010), Ann Arbor, Michigan (2011), Princeton, New Jersey (2012), and Seoul, South Korea (2013).

ALTE's international conferences are held in different cities in Europe: Barcelona, Spain (2002); Berlin, Germany (2005); Cambridge, UK (2008); Krakow, Poland (2011); Paris,France (2014); Bologna, Italy (2017) ) with regional conferences in Perugia, Prague, Budapest, Sofia, and Lisbon. Similarly, there are regional meetings in China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. International conference themes have included supporting the European Year of Languages (2001), the impact of multilingualism (2005), the wider social and educational impact of assessment (2008) and the role of language frameworks (2011). Selected conference papers have been published through the [[Studies in Language Testing (SiLT)]] volumes.

== Publications ==
There are two premier journals in the field: ''Language Assessment Quarterly'' (published by [[Routledge]]/[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]) currently edited by James E. Purpura and ''[[Language Testing]]'' (published by [[Sage Publications]]) currently edited by Glenn Fulcher and April Ginther that publishes major findings from researchers. Both these journals are indexed in Thompson's SSCI list. SpringerNature publishes ''Language Testing in Asia'', which is focussed on Asia, the Middle East and Oceania. Other journals that publish articles from the field include ''[[Applied Linguistics (journal)|Applied Linguistics]]'', ''Language Learning'', ''[[TESOL Quarterly]]'', ''Assessing Writing'', and ''[[System (journal)|System]]''. Some of these journals have special issue volumes on Ethics in language assessment, structural equation modeling, language assessment in Asia, Classroom assessment, etc. and commentaries, brief reports, and book and test reviews.

The field has exploded in the last twenty years in terms of textbooks and research publications. The most popular books include: Lyle Bachman's ''Fundamental considerations in language testing,'' and ''Statistical Analyses for Language Assessment,'' Lyle Bachman and Adrian Palmer's ''Language Testing in Practice'' and ''Language Assessment in Practice,' Glenn Fulcher and Fred Davidson's 'Language Testing and Assessment: An Advanced Resource Book', Charles Alderson's 'Assessing Reading,'' John Read's ''Assessing Vocabulary,'' James Purpura's ''Assessing Grammar,'' Gary Buck's ''Assessing Listening,'' Sara Weigle's ''[[Assessing Writing]],' Glenn Fulcher's 'Practical Language Testing' and 'Testing Second Language Speaking'. Edited volumes include: [[Alister Cumming]]'s ''Validation in Language Testing,'' Antony John Kunnan's ''Validation in Language Assessment,'' and ''Fairness in Language Assessment,'' and the 'Routledge Handbook of Language Testing', edited by Glenn Fulcher and Fred Davidson.

The most popular book series are Michael Milanovic, Cyril Weir, and Lynda Taylor's [[Studies in Language Testing (SiLT)]] series, and Lyle Bachman and Charles Alderson's ''Cambridge Language Assessment Series.''

== Courses ==
Language assessment or language testing courses are taught as required or elective courses in many graduate and [[doctoral]] programs, particularly in the subjects of [[applied linguistics]], [[English for Speakers of Other Languages]], [[English as a second language|English as a second or foreign language]], or educational linguistics. These programs are known as MA or PhD programs in Applied Linguistics, Educational Linguistics, [[English as a Foreign or Second Language|TESOL]], [[TEFL]], or [[TESL]]. The focus of most courses is on test development, [[psychometric]] qualities of tests, [[Validity (logic)|validity]], [[reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and fairness of tests, and [[classical true score measurement theory]].  Additional courses focus on [[item response theory]], [[factor analysis]], [[structural equation modeling]], [[G factor (psychometrics)|G theory]], [[latent growth modeling]],  [[Qualitative research|qualitative analysis]] of test performance data such as conversation and [[discourse analysis]], and politics and language policy issues.

Universities that have regular courses and programs that focus on language assessment at the Ph.D. level include University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, University of Hawai'i, Manoa, Teachers College, Columbia University, Penn State University, Georgia State University, Northern Arizona University, McGill University, University of Toronto, Lancaster University (UK), University of Leicester, University of Bristol, University of Cambridge, University of Bedfordshire, and Guangdong University of Foreign Studies (China); at the MA level include Lancaster University, University of Leicester, California State Universities at Fullerton, Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Jose, and San Francisco.

From the beginning of the twenty first century, the term '''language coaching''' started to become used more and more in the field of [[Language_education|language teaching and language learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Dimitrios Thanasoulas (2002) 'The changing winds and shifting sands of the history of English Language Teaching' Online at EnglishClub.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tony Corballis (2006) 'White Paper' Online at Corballis Communication Ltd&lt;/ref&gt;

Theoretically, language coaching encompasses the teaching and training of foreign languages but incorporates principles, models and competences from the field of [[life coaching]]. These principles, competences and models may originate from coaching organisations themselves such as the [http://www.coachfederation.org/ International Coach Federation] in the USA or from particular coaching models or practices such as [[GROW_model|GROW]].

Thus, the whole process behind life coaching, such as goal setting, action and strategy setting, reviewing goals and really getting coachees to focus on personal development and accomplish feats step by step is then transported into the language learning process. 

The development of language coaching in the language teaching world is on the rise and more and more language teachers appear to be calling themselves language coaches. It is often difficult to distinguish between unqualified language teachers, qualified language teachers, language teachers with a specialization such as ESP ([[English for Specific Purposes]]) and now language coaches. It is also not clear if so called language coaches have any coaching qualifications or experience as life coaches. 

'''Neurolanguage Coaching''' 

In 2012, Rachel Marie Paling from Efficient Language Coaching™ defined Neurolanguage Coaching as follows:

“''Neurolanguage Coaching™ is the efficient and fast transfer of language knowledge and skills from the Language Coach to the Language Coachee with sustainable effects facilitated by brain-based coaching and coaching principles and [[neuroscience]]''.” 
© 2012 Rachel M. Paling&lt;ref&gt;http://www.languagecoachingcertification.com/language-coaching&lt;/ref&gt; 

Paling wrote an article to distinguish the differences between language coaching and language teaching&lt;ref&gt;http://www.languagecoachingcertification.com/differences-language-teaching-and-language-coaching&lt;/ref&gt; in 2013, and this was echoed in the article by Dimitris Zeppos in a table demonstrating the principal differences between language teaching and language coaching:

==History==
Horstman and Auzenne learned about podcasting in 2005 and decided that this could be a way to disseminate their knowledge about effective management.&lt;ref name="showabout" /&gt; Auzenne said he didn’t want to create a model where he would only give away half of a solution and then require the audience to pay for the rest of the solution.&lt;ref name="Mikeint"&gt;Mike Auzenne in: Manager Tools: Making Money from Podcasting article by David Spark on http://www.sparkminute.com/2009/09/29/manager-tools-making-money-from-podcasting/&lt;/ref&gt;  The co-founders have stated that they believe they can change the world by changing management, and that the way to change it is one manager at a time.&lt;ref name="mtweb" /&gt; After starting with the weekly free podcasts, both hosts completely dedicated their work time, and became co-founders of Manager Tools LLC, a management consulting firm.&lt;ref name="mtAbout" /&gt; They regularly consult to and train managers in [[Fortune 1000]] companies around the world.&lt;ref name="careers"&gt;Career Tools Wins Business Category of People's Choice Podcast Awards http://www.eworldwire.com/pressreleases/211975&lt;/ref&gt; Their company also sells transcripts of the podcasts on-line through membership, and they organize public and in-company conferences to practice the Manager Tools.&lt;ref name="Mikeint"/&gt; As of 2012, the company has five full-time employees.

==Podcasts==
Most casts are about 30–40 minutes long, presented as a dialogue between the two hosts.&lt;ref name="smb"&gt;http://www.smbtrendwire.com/2008/01/07/podcast-review-manager-tools/ Review at Small Business Trends Radio (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; They cover a specific topic related to management or career development. Casts start with an overview of the points to be discussed, followed by the discussion point by point, and end with a summary of the points discussed.

Manager Tools main podcasts are available on the webpage and also through [[iTunes]] and [[RSS]] feeds.&lt;ref&gt;List of Manager Tools Podcasts https://www.manager-tools.com/podcasts&lt;/ref&gt; The podcasts often refer to each other which in the past has created issues with new listeners. In order to help them, a collection of 'basics' casts has been created and is available on their website as well.&lt;ref name="mtBasics" /&gt; Those cover mostly 'The Management Trinity' as well as additional basic notions.

Manager Tools casts help ''90 percent of the people, 90 percent of the time''.&lt;ref&gt;Feedback From Your Directs - What To Say - Part 1 http://www.manager-tools.com/2012/04/feedback-your-directs-what-say-part-1&lt;/ref&gt; And the great majority of the casts are timeless instead of just timely.&lt;ref name="Newsletter"&gt;Mark Horstman, "Things I Think I Think" newsletter from 26 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Management]] is about doing the right things repeatedly. Successful managers do them over and over again; and is about '''Behaviors'''.&lt;ref&gt;One-on-Ones: The Single Most Effective Management Tool http://www.manager-tools.com/2005/07/the-single-most-effective-management-tool-part-1&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Manager Tools motto is : "'''There's a cast for that'''".

*'''Manager Tools podcast''': ''Every Manager Effective''.&lt;ref name="mtAbout" /&gt;

The Manager Tools '''"Basics"''' — is a special collection of podcasts on the essentials of effective managerial behavior and the base of all the Manager Tools advanced material.

The podcasts are often articulated around the 'Manager Tools Philosophy'.&lt;ref name="showabout" /&gt; Its main parts are ''''The Management Trinity'''' and the ''''Horstman's Laws''''. The founders focus on specific action steps that managers can apply to their job as opposed to theoretical management models.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atkinsonadvisor.com/hits-bytes/www-manager-tool-com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Content and theories==

===Foundational Principles - The Management Trinity===

The hosts often refers to the ''''Management Trinity'''':&lt;ref&gt;https://www.manager-tools.com/2013/01/positive-feedback-before-its-time&lt;/ref&gt; One on Ones, Feedback, and Coaching, plus their silent fourth partner, Delegation. These are at the heart of everything Manager Tools recommends.&lt;ref&gt;The Management Trinity http://www.manager-tools.com/2009/10/management-trinity-part-1&lt;/ref&gt; All Of The Manager Tools Trinity Tools are ''Teachable Equivalents'' that the hosts have developed. Most casts are based on these tools.

They usually include:&lt;ref name="mtBasics"&gt;List of Basic Manager Tools Podcasts https://www.manager-tools.com/manager-tools-basics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Managing Responsibilities http://www.ymresourcer.com/documents/Managing_Responsibilities.doc&lt;/ref&gt;
*One on Ones (Weekly meetings in order to reinforce relationships) - recognised as "the best business practice of all time" by profitguide.com&lt;ref&gt;http://www.profitguide.com/article/78170--the-30-best-business-practices-of-all-time&lt;/ref&gt; -
*Feedback (reinforcing or correcting behaviours)
*Coaching (Fostering Continuous Development)
*Delegation (Managerial Economics of who should do a task)

Other foundational principles as described in the 'basics' podcasts include:&lt;ref name="mtBasics" /&gt;
* Running Effective Meetings
* Methods for rolling out the Manager Tools Trinity
* 'Solution to a Stalled Technical Career'

===DISC - Management adapted to the personality of the direct report===
Manager Tools podcasts often refer to the [[DISC assessment]] when adapting management and communication styles to individuals.

The DiSC model provides nonjudgmental language for exploring behavioral issues across four personality traits ('''D'''ominance, '''I'''nfluence, '''S'''teadiness and '''C'''onscientious.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inscapepartners.com/discclassic/&lt;/ref&gt; These four traits can be grouped in a grid with "D" and "I" sharing the top row and representing extroverted aspects of the personality, and "C" and "S" below representing introverted aspects. "D" and "C" then share the left column and represent task-focused aspects, and "I" and "S" share the right column and represent social aspects. In this matrix, the vertical dimension represents a factor of "Assertive" or "Passive", while the horizontal dimension represents "Open" vs. "Guarded".&lt;ref&gt;[[DISC assessment]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other principles===
There are also some recurring references to other 'rules' or 'laws'. These are mostly referred to verbally in the podcasts:&lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools Forum Post https://www.manager-tools.com/forums/hortsmans-laws-podcast&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manager Tools Forum Post https://www.manager-tools.com/forums/horstmans-laws-01&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marine ecoregions''' are [[ecoregion]]s (ecological regions) of the [[ocean]]s and [[sea]]s identified and defined based on [[biogeographic]] characteristics.

==Introduction==
A more complete definition describes them as “Areas of relatively homogeneous species composition, clearly distinct from adjacent systems” dominated by “a small number of ecosystems and/or a distinct suite of oceanographic or topographic features”. Ecologically they “are strongly cohesive units, sufficiently large to encompass ecological or life history processes for most sedentary species.”&lt;ref name="Spalding"&gt;Spalding, Mark D., Helen E. Fox, Gerald R. Allen, Nick Davidson et al. "Marine Ecoregions of the World: A Bioregionalization of Coastal and Shelf Areas". Bioscience Vol. 57 No. 7, July/August 2007, pp. 573–583.[http://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/bioscience/57/7/10.1641_B570707/3/57-7-573.pdf?Expires=1484610727&amp;Signature=XYF4SP8EUihI-sTDvmf65b0NlH9f2XUORgslN8hcINKG08LsR1~j09N1Ore6Uxb6KpvLzoqZm-DTCwJIqojSKm-EUdzTDGXjG4X0528teZe7KpEhwBxIE3MsBSgurcuDVnCUVewcgFXchiQIiOTMPxMGh58PynDEy9js8suNnww9f-CvmAUVB~CYOjM2XY~qSO3njZx4q5tJZrqhoqWy3wAT52hmK7vcAgyLMFNnzB7rAoMp2UDoixN5FKgPWbL9l-pK6nZvMriyRFqHbEurd8-QoDhYgZm5NsQDkbhHuTKZ4av5y9lXCxRnTylJbpnbe9qIdiUncnT9eHfTLu69Zg__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAIUCZBIA4LVPAVW3Q]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marine Ecoregions of the World—MEOW==
The global classification system '''Marine Ecoregions of the World—MEOW''' was devised by an international team, including major conservation organizations, academic institutions and intergovernmental organizations.&lt;ref name="Spalding" /&gt;  The digital ecoregions layer is available for download as an ArcGIS Shapefile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conserveonline.org/workspaces/ecoregional.shapefile/MEOW/view.html MEOW digital ecoregions layer: ArcGIS Shapefile download link]&lt;/ref&gt;

This system has a strong biogeographic basis, but was designed to aid in [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] activities for [[marine ecosystems]]. 

===Subdivisions===
====Ecoregions====
The Marine Ecoregions of the World classification defines 232 marine ecoregions (e.g. [[Adriatic Sea]], [[Cortezian]], [[Ningaloo]], [[Ross Sea]]) for the coastal and [[Continental shelf|shelf]] waters of the world. 

====Provinces====
These marine ecoregions form part of a nested system and are grouped into 62 provinces (e.g. the [[South China Sea]], [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Indian Ocean|Central Indian Ocean Islands]]).

====Realms====
The provinces in turn, are grouped into 12 major realms. The latter are considered analogous to the eight terrestrial [[ecozones]], represent large regions of the ocean basins: 
# [[Arctic realm|Arctic]]
# Temperate Northern Atlantic
# [[Temperate Northern Pacific]]
# [[Tropical Atlantic]]
# [[Western Indo-Pacific]]
# [[Central Indo-Pacific]]
# Eastern Indo-Pacific
# [[Tropical Eastern Pacific]]
# Temperate South America
# Temperate Southern Africa
# Temperate Australasia
# [[Southern Ocean]]

==Other marine ecoregion classifications==
Other classifications of marine ecoregions or equivalent areas have been widely developed at national and regional levels, as well as a small number of global schemes. 

Each of these systems, along with numerous regional biogeographic classifications, was used to inform the MEOW system. The WWF Global 200 work also identifies a number of major habitat types that correspond to the terrestrial [[biomes]]: polar, temperate shelves and seas, temperate upwelling, tropical upwelling, tropical coral, pelagic (trades and westerlies), abyssal, and hadal (ocean trench).

;Briggs Coastal Provinces
One of the most comprehensive early classifications was the system of 53 coastal provinces developed by Briggs in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs JC (1974) Marine Zoogeography. McGraw-Hill, New York, USA&lt;/ref&gt; The near-global system of 64 [[large marine ecosystem]]s has a partial biogeographic basis. 

;WWF Global 200
The [[World Wildlife Fund]]—WWF identified 43 [[List of marine ecoregions|priority marine ecoregions]], as part of its Global 200 efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Olson DM, Dinerstein E. 2002; "The Global 200: priority ecoregions for conservation"; Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden 89: 199-224&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following the founding of an apprenticeship-training program in librarianship in 1897, the McGill Summer Library School was formally founded in 1904 under the jurisdiction of the University Library Committee to offer education in library administration. It was the first formal library education program in Canada, and one of the first university programs in librarianship outside of the United States. The School was renamed the Graduate School of Library Science in 1965, the Graduate School of Library and Information Studies in 1985, and the School of Information Studies in 2007.

[[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] microorganisms possess membrane-bound cell [[organelles]] and include [[fungi]] and [[protists]], whereas [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] organisms—all of which are microorganisms—are conventionally classified as lacking membrane-bound organelles and include [[Bacteria]] and [[Archaea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781118960608|title=Bergey's Manual of Systematics of Archaea and Bacteria|last=Whitman|first=Whilliam B|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2015|isbn=9781118960608|location=|pages=|doi=10.1002/9781118960608}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pace|first=Norman R.|date=2006|title=Time for a change|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/441289a|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=441|issue=7091|pages=289–289|doi=10.1038/441289a|issn=0028-0836|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Microbiologists traditionally relied on culture, staining, and microscopy. However, less than 1% of the microorganisms present in common environments can be cultured in isolation using current means.&lt;ref name="Amann1995"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nitesh RA, Ludwig W, Schleifer KH | year = 2011 | title = Phylogenetic identification and in situ detection of individual microbial cells without cultivation | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 59 | pages = 143–169 | pmid = 7535888 | issue = 1 | pmc = 239358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbiologists often rely on molecular biology tools such as DNA sequence based identification, for example 16s rRNA gene sequence used for bacteria identification.

[[Virus]]es have been variably classified as organisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Rice G | title = Are Viruses Alive? | url = http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/yellowstone/viruslive.html | date = 2007-03-27 |accessdate = 2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they have been considered either as very simple microorganisms or very complex molecules. [[Prions]], never considered as microorganisms, have been investigated by virologists, however, as the clinical effects traced to them were originally presumed due to chronic viral infections, and virologists took search—discovering "infectious proteins".

The existence of microorganisms was predicted many centuries before they were first observed, for example by the Jains in India and by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in ancient Rome. The first recorded microscope observation was of the fruiting bodies of moulds, by [[Robert Hooke]] in 1666, but the Jesuit priest [[Athanasius Kircher]] was likely the first to see microbes, which he mentioned observing in milk and putrid material in 1658. [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] is considered a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|father of microbiology]] as he observed and experimented with [[microscopic organisms]] in 1676, using simple [[microscope]]s of his own design. Scientific microbiology developed in the 19th century through the work of [[Louis Pasteur]] and in medical microbiology [[Robert Koch]].

==History==
[[File:Avicenna TajikistanP17-20Somoni-1999 (cropped).png|left|thumb|upright|[[Avicenna]] hypothesized the existence of microorganisms.]]

The existence of microorganisms was hypothesized for many centuries before their actual discovery. The existence of unseen microbiological life was postulated by [[Jainism]] which is based on [[Mahavira]]’s teachings as early as 6th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Mahavira is dated 599 BC - 527 BC. See {{cite book | last =Dundas | first =Paul |author2=John Hinnels ed. | title =The Jain | publisher =Routledge | year =2002 | location =London | isbn =0-415-26606-8 }} p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Dundas notes that Mahavira asserted the existence of unseen microbiological creatures living in earth, water, air and fire.&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (2002) p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jain scriptures]] describe [[nigoda]]s which are sub-microscopic creatures living in large clusters and having a very short life, said to pervade every part of the universe, even in tissues of plants and flesh of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Jaini | first =Padmanabh | title =The Jaina Path of Purification | publisher =Motilal Banarsidass | year =1998 | location =New Delhi | isbn =81-208-1578-5 |page= 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] made references to microbes when he warned against locating a homestead in the vicinity of swamps "because there are bred certain minute creatures which cannot be seen by the eyes, which float in the air and enter the body through the mouth and nose and thereby cause serious diseases."&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Terentius Varro]]. ''Varro on Agriculture'' 1, xii Loeb.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the golden age of Islamic civilization, Iranian scientists hypothesized the existence of microorganisms, such as [[Avicenna]] in his book ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'', [[Ibn Zuhr]] (also known as Avenzoar) who discovered [[scabies]] mites, and [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Al-Razi]] who gave the earliest known description of [[smallpox]] in his book ''The Virtuous Life'' (al-Hawi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=فى الحضارة الإسلامية - ديوان العرب|trans-title=Microbiology in Islam|url=http://www.diwanalarab.com/spip.php?article34512|work=Diwanalarab.com|language=ar|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1546, [[Girolamo Fracastoro]] proposed that [[epidemic]] [[diseases]] were caused by transferable seedlike entities that could transmit infection by direct or indirect contact, or vehicle transmission.&lt;ref&gt;Fracastoro, Girolamo (1546), ''De Contagione et Contagiosis Morbis'' transl.

"We may fairly call Leeuwenhoek “The first microbiologist” because he was the first individual to actually [[culture (microbiology)|culture]], see, and describe a large array of [[microbial life]].

Kircher was among the first to design magic lanterns for projection purposes, so he must have been well acquainted with the properties of lenses.&lt;ref name=pmid12964250/&gt; He wrote "Concerning the wonderful structure of things in nature, investigated by Microscope" in 1646, stating "who would believe that vinegar and milk abound with an innumerable multitude of worms." He also noted that putrid material is full of innumerable creeping animalcules. He published his ''Scrutinium Pestis'' (Examination of the Plague) in 1658, stating correctly that the disease was caused by microbes, though what he saw was most likely red or white blood cells rather than the plague agent itself.&lt;ref name=pmid12964250/&gt;

==The birth of bacteriology==

[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Innovative [[laboratory glassware]] and experimental methods developed by [[Louis Pasteur]] and other biologists contributed to the young field of bacteriology in the late 19th century.]]

The field of [[bacteriology]] (later a subdiscipline of microbiology) was founded in the 19th century by [[Ferdinand Cohn]], a botanist whose studies on [[algae]] and [[Phototroph|photosynthetic bacteria]] led him to describe several bacteria including ''[[Bacillus]]'' and ''[[Beggiatoa]]''. Cohn was also the first to formulate a scheme for the [[taxonomic classification]] of bacteria, and to discover [[endospore]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Drews, G. |title=Ferdinand Cohn, among the Founder of Microbiology |journal=ASM News |volume=65 |issue=8 |page=547 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Robert Koch]] were contemporaries of Cohn, and are often considered to be the father of microbiology&lt;ref name=pmid12964250/&gt; and [[medical microbiology]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Sherris&gt;{{cite book | editor=Ryan, K.J. |editor2=Ray, C.G. | title=Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition=4th | publisher=McGraw Hill | year=2004 | isbn=0-8385-8529-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur is most famous for his series of experiments designed to disprove the then widely held [[theory of spontaneous generation]], thereby solidifying microbiology’s identity as a biological science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bordenave, G. |title=Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) |journal=Microbes Infect. |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=553–60 |year=2003 |pmid=12758285 |doi=10.1016/S1286-4579(03)00075-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his students, Adrien Certes, is considered the founder of marine microbiology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Adler |first=Antony |last2=Dücker |first2=Erik |date=2017-04-05 |title=When Pasteurian Science Went to Sea: The Birth of Marine Microbiology |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10739-017-9477-8 |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=51 |pages=1–27 |doi=10.1007/s10739-017-9477-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur also designed methods for food preservation ([[pasteurization]]) and vaccines against several diseases such as [[anthrax]], fowl cholera and [[rabies]].&lt;ref name=Brock /&gt; Koch is best known for his contributions to the [[germ theory of disease]], proving that specific diseases were caused by specific pathogenic micro-organisms. He developed a series of criteria that have become known as the [[Koch's postulates]]. Koch was one of the first [[scientists]] to focus on the isolation of [[bacteria]] in [[pure culture]] resulting in his description of several novel bacteria including ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', the causative agent of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=Brock /&gt;

While Pasteur and Koch are often considered the founders of microbiology, their work did not accurately reflect the true diversity of the microbial world because of their exclusive focus on micro-organisms having direct medical relevance. It was not until the late 19th century and the work of [[Martinus Beijerinck]] and [[Sergei Winogradsky]] that the true breadth of microbiology was revealed.&lt;ref name=Brock /&gt; Beijerinck made two major contributions to microbiology: the discovery of [[virus]]es and the development of [[enrichment culture]]&lt;!-- should this be [[Growth medium]] or [[Microbiological culture]] ? --&gt; techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Johnson, J. | title=Martinus Willem Beijerinck | work=APSnet| publisher=American Phytopathological Society | url=http://apsnet.org/education/feature/TMV/intro.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620173433/http://apsnet.org/education/feature/TMV/intro.html | archivedate=2010-06-20 | year=2001 |origyear=1998 | accessdate=May 2, 2010}} Retrieved from Internet Archive January 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; While his work on the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] established the basic principles of virology, it was his development of enrichment culturing that had the most immediate impact on microbiology by allowing for the cultivation of a wide range of microbes with wildly different physiologies.

==Branches==

{{main|Branches of microbiology}}

The [[branches of microbiology]] can be classified into pure and applied sciences, or divided according to taxonomy, as is the case with [[bacteriology]], [[mycology]], [[protozoology]], and [[phycology]]. There is considerable overlap between the specific branches of microbiology with each other and with other disciplines, and certain aspects of these branches can extend beyond the traditional scope of microbiology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.generalmicroscience.com/microbiology/branches-of-microbiology/ |title=Branches of Microbiology |date=2017-01-13 |work=General MicroScience |accessdate=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms |isbn=978-0321897398 |edition=14th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--please don't put lists here, see the linked list article for those--&gt;

==Applications==
[[File:Cuves de fermentations.jpg|thumb|upright|Fermenting tanks with [[yeast]] being used to [[Brewing|brew]] [[beer]] ]]

While some [[Mysophobia|fear microbes]] due to the association of some microbes with various human diseases, many microbes are also responsible for numerous beneficial processes such as [[industrial fermentation]] (e.g. the production of [[alcohol]], [[vinegar]] and [[dairy products]]), [[antibiotic]] production and act as molecular vehicles to transfer DNA to complex organisms such as plants and animals. Scientists have also exploited their knowledge of microbes to produce biotechnologically important [[enzyme]]s such as [[Taq polymerase]], [[reporter gene]]s for use in other genetic systems and novel molecular biology techniques such as the [[two-hybrid screening|yeast two-hybrid system]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Bacteria can be used for the industrial production of [[amino acid]]s. ''Corynebacterium glutamicum'' is one of the most important bacterial species with an annual production of more than two million tons of amino acids, mainly L-glutamate and L-lysine.&lt;ref name= BurkovskiA&gt;{{cite book | author = Burkovski A (editor). | title = Corynebacteria: Genomics and Molecular Biology | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/cory | isbn =1-904455-30-1 | accessdate = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since some bacteria have the ability to synthesize antibiotics, they are used for medicinal purposes, such as [[Streptomyces]] to make [[aminoglycoside antibiotics]].&lt;ref name= "Puglisi, Joseph D."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fourmy |first1=Dominique |last2=Recht |first2=Michael I. |last3=Blanchard |first3=Scott C |last4=Puglisi |first4=Joseph D. |title=Structure of the A site of Escherichia coli 16S ribosomal RNA complexed with an Aminoglycoside Antibiotic |journal=Science |year=1996 |volume=274 |issue=5291 |pages=1367–1371 |doi=10.1126/science.274.5291.1367 |pmid=8910275 |url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/16908e7d27610a0ebc4ced7ed2aa56cf/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=1256 |accessdate=2016-04-05|bibcode=1996Sci...274.1367F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of [[biopolymer]]s, such as [[polysaccharide]]s, [[polyester]]s, and [[polyamide]]s, are produced by microorganisms. Microorganisms are used for the biotechnological production of biopolymers with tailored properties suitable for high-value medical application such as [[tissue engineering]] and drug delivery. Microorganisms are used for the biosynthesis of [[xanthan]], [[alginate]], [[cellulose]], [[cyanophycin]], poly(gamma-glutamic acid), [[levan polysaccharide|levan]], [[hyaluronic acid]], organic acids, [[oligosaccharide]]s and [[polysaccharide]], and polyhydroxyalkanoates.&lt;ref name= RehmBHA&gt;{{cite book | author = Rehm BHA (editor). | title = Microbial Production of Biopolymers and Polymer Precursors: Applications and Perspectives | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/biopolymers | isbn =978-1-904455-36-3 | accessdate = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microorganisms are beneficial for [[microbial biodegradation]] or [[bioremediation]] of domestic, agricultural and industrial wastes and subsurface [[pollution]] in soils, sediments and marine environments. The ability of each microorganism to degrade [[toxic waste]] depends on the nature of each [[contaminant]]. Since sites typically have multiple pollutant types, the most effective approach to [[microbial biodegradation]] is to use a mixture of bacterial and fungal species and strains, each specific to the [[biodegradation]] of one or more types of contaminants.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;{{cite book | author = Diaz E (editor). | title = Microbial Biodegradation: Genomics and Molecular Biology | edition = 1st | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2008 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/biod | isbn =1-904455-17-4 | accessdate = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mutualism (biology)|Symbiotic]] microbial communities confer benefits to their human and animal hosts health including aiding digestion, producing beneficial vitamins and amino acids, and suppressing pathogenic microbes. Some benefit may be conferred by eating fermented foods, [[probiotics]] (bacteria potentially beneficial to the digestive system) or [[prebiotics]] (substances consumed to promote the growth of probiotic microorganisms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=1115424|year=1999 |last1=MacFarlane|first1=GT |last2=Cummings|first2=JH |title=Probiotics and prebiotics: Can regulating the activities of intestinal bacteria benefit health? |volume=318 |issue=7189 |pages=999–1003|journal=BMJ: British Medical Journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.318.7189.999 |pmid=10195977}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tannockpro3&gt;{{cite book | editor= Tannock GW | title = Probiotics and Prebiotics: Scientific Aspects | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2005 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/pro3 | isbn =978-1-904455-01-1 | accessdate = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ways the microbiome influences human and animal health, as well as methods to influence the microbiome are active areas of research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=strange-but-true-humans-carry-more-bacterial-cells-than-human-ones|title=Humans Carry More Bacterial Cells than Human Ones|last=Wenner|first=Melinda|magazine=Scientific American|date=30 November 2007|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has suggested that microorganisms could be useful in the treatment of [[cancer]]. Various strains of non-pathogenic [[Clostridium|clostridia]] can infiltrate and replicate within solid tumors. Clostridial vectors can be safely administered and their potential to deliver therapeutic proteins has been demonstrated in a variety of preclinical models.&lt;ref name= Mengesha&gt;{{cite book |author= Mengesha|year=2009|chapter=Clostridia in Anti-tumor Therapy |title=Clostridia: Molecular Biology in the Post-genomic Era|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn = 978-1-904455-38-7 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- These traits allowed Joshua and Esther Lederberg to devise an elegant experiment in 1951 demonstrating that [[adaptive mutation]]s arise from [[preadaptation]] rather than [[directed mutation]]. For this purpose, they invented [[replica plating]], which allowed them to transfer numerous [[colony (biology)|bacterial colonies]] from their specific locations on one [[agar]]-filled [[petri dish]] to analogous locations on several other petri dishes. After replicating a plate of ''E. coli'', they exposed each of the new plates to a [[bacteriophage]]. They observed that phage-resistant colonies were present at analogous locations on each of the plates, allowing them to conclude that the phage resistance trait had existed in the original colony, which had never been exposed to phage, instead of arising after the bacteria had been exposed to the virus.--&gt;

'''Neurological reparative therapy''' ('''NRT''') is a new model of treatment synthesized from a compilation of literature and research on how to better the lives of individuals who suffer from a wide range of [[mind|mental]], [[emotional]], and [[behavioral]] disturbances – particularly children and adolescents. Although the term "neurological reparative therapy" is new, the foundation of this model is not.

NRT is not a [[proscription|proscriptive]] model, in that it does not outline ''how'' the therapy is to be conducted. A preponderance of evidence shows that the most important component of successful treatment is not the approach or techniques, but the professional caring and competence of the therapist engaging with the client in a supportive, cathartic, and healing manner. The NRT roadmap provides the best route to healthy brain development, attachment, and resiliency, but relies on the helper to use his or her own skills, experience, and techniques to take the journey.

==Principles==
Neurological reparative therapy is not a program or a technique, but is better explained as a roadmap describing the journey of [[healing]] and repair of the [[mental process]]es preventing the individual from achieving personal goals and personal contentment. NRT outlines the goal and ultimate destination of treatment, and provides a roadmap with the mileposts along the way. NRT does not proscribe the methods, the techniques, or the approaches that are the vehicle for the client and [[therapist]] to travel the road together. NRT is specifically designed to optimize the [[skills]] and abilities of the therapist by taking advantage of the therapist's [[knowledge]], [[training]], and experience in joining with the clients on the healing journey. The model outlines what needs to be addressed in treatment – the therapy components critical to internal change – and points out that "knowing where you are going" is the key to arriving successfully at the destination.

== History ==
Although the term neurological reparative therapy is relatively new, the history of the model goes back many decades. NRT has its foundation in the integrated treatment of extreme [[mind|mental]], [[emotional]], and [[behavioral]] disturbances in very young children. The term was first used in the writings of a psychologist, [[David Lee Ziegler, Ph.D.|D.L. Ziegler]], working with children who had experienced severe trauma and [[abuse]].&lt;ref name="Ziegler NRT"&gt;Ziegler, D.L. (2011).  Neurological Reparative Therapy, a roadmap to healing, resiliency and well-being.  Jasper, OR: Jasper Mountain.&lt;/ref&gt; Ziegler found that integrating brain research, [[attachment theory]], and [[Psychological resilience|resiliency]] work within trauma treatment resulted in an unexpected outcome – significant functional improvement following the cessation of treatment. This led him to the conclusion that the change was ''internal'' (i.e. neurological) in nature, and was not conditional upon a place, an individual, or the environmental circumstances. After studying years of practice-based evidence, it was found that the treatment orientation or approach of the therapist was not the determining factor in positive outcomes, but rather the integration of components of positive brain change (attachment, resiliency, and trauma treatment within the framework of how the brain functions) that frequently resulted in change "from the inside out".

== Integrated components ==
The four pillars of neurological reparative therapy are [[Neural development|Brain Development]], [[Attachment Theory|Attachment]], Resiliency, and Trauma Treatment. The integration of all these components provides the [[synergy]] that leads to optimal positive brain change, which provides lasting change. Of these pillars, the research and literature on attachment is the oldest of the four, going back nearly a half-century. The ability of an individual to successfully bond and attach to others has been growing in importance as new information is learned about how the [[human body]] – and specifically how the brain – modulates and copes with [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. There is now a new resurgence in focusing on attachment in the treatment process of individuals, couples, and families. Resiliency research is showing it is not the negative experiences everyone encounters in life that is key, but rather the ability of the individual to cope with and bounce back from adverse situations. Resiliency is growing in importance not only in [[mental health]] settings but also in educational, occupational, and medical areas. The pillar that has seen the most influx over the last two decades has been brain development. The explosion of new information has been facilitated by sophisticated [[Neuroimaging|brain scanning]] technology, to determine in real time how the brain is processing and responding to interventions. At this point, our knowledge of the brain and how it works is doubling every ten years. NRT works to integrate new information on the brain into the healing process. While the field of trauma treatment is as old as is attachment, it takes significant advantage of the new research on brain development to better target the brain with positive change. For damaged individuals, trauma treatment is the container, while attachment, resiliency, and brain development are the included ingredients of the NRT process.

== Is NRT an evidence-based practice? ==
On the continuum of [[evidence-based practice]]s and practice-based evidence, the neurological reparative therapy model is in the middle. Causal research has limitations when it comes to isolating [[Variable and attribute (research)|variables]] in an intervention with integrated components. NRT allows for the use of any and all evidence-based practices as the vehicle of treatment, since it does not restrict or specify any therapeutic approach or method. NRT places the responsibility for how the therapeutic process is conducted on the therapist. Evidence-based practices should be a major consideration of all treatment.

== Research ==
Because neurological reparative therapy is an integration of an amalgam of components and a wide range of methods, the limitations of [[causality|causal]] research make it difficult to determine if one ingredient of the process is more significant than any others. NRT primarily relies on the research and literature of the four pillars that form the conceptual foundation of the Model. There is significant literature and research concerning how the human brain functions.&lt;ref name="Hariri"&gt;Hariri A.R. &amp; Holmes A. (2006).

Childhood origins of self-destructive behavior.  ''American Journal of Psychiatry.'' 148, 1665-1671.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of resiliency is built upon a number of skills and attitudes, and has been expanded by the recent interest in psychology with respect to finding out what is ''right'' with individuals rather than what is ''wrong'' with them. The foundation of resiliency is built upon believing in yourself, having personal [[confidence]], being able to connect in a positive way with others, and allowing others to support you. The area of resiliency has strong research support.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Brown, S. L., Nesse, R., Vinokur, A. D., &amp; Smith, D. M. (2003).

'''Paul Henry Lang''' (August 28, 1901 in [[Budapest]] – September 21, 1991 in [[Lakeville, Connecticut]]) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-[[United States|American]] [[musicologist]] and [[music critic]].

Lang was born in Budapest, [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], and was educated in Catholic schools. In 1918, as World War I was coming to an end, he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian army though he had not completed school, and sent to the Italian front.&lt;ref&gt;As told by PHL to family&lt;/ref&gt; When the war ended, he had to make his own way home, and then studied at the University of Budapest and the [[Budapest Music Academy]], under [[Zoltán Kodály]] and Erno Dohnanyi, among others. Kodály, learning that he only played piano, assigned him to learn to play the bassoon. After graduating in 1922, he was an assistant conductor at the Budapest Opera, but was encouraged to study musicology by Kodály and [[Béla Bartók]]. At that time serious study in musicology was only available in France and Germany. He began at the [[University of Heidelberg]] where he attended classes in philosophy and literature as well. He was not happy in Germany and moved on to the [[Sorbonne]] in Paris, where he studied with Andre Pirro. In the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] Lang participated as part of the French National rowing team. He supported himself by playing bassoon in various orchestras and also conducted an emigrant Hungarian chorus. While a student in Paris he began his career as a music critic, writing for the ''[[Revue Musicale]]''. He completed his dissertation on French lute music, but was not awarded his doctoral degree because he could not afford the large sum needed to engrave the unpublished scores he was discussing and print the dissertation, as required by the university.&lt;ref&gt;PHL oral history, 1981, at Columbia University Center for Oral History&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, knowing no English,&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Paul Henry Lang's wife, Anne Pecheux Lang, in letter to the ''New York Review of Books'', http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2006/mar/23/paul-henry-lang/. Retrieved July 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Lang moved to the United States as a junior scholar of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. He took a few English classes and then picked up more from motion pictures. He taught music, including harmony and counterpoint, for a year at [[Vassar College]] (1930–31), filling in for a professor on sabbatical. Then at [[Wells College]] (1932–34), he taught music history and analysis and led the chapel choir. At the same time he worked on a dissertation on the literary history of French opera,earning a [[doctorate degree]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1934. Having by now published a few articles in English, he was invited to teach at both Wellesley College and Columbia. For one year he taught at both colleges. Mr. Lang joined the music faculty of Columbia University in 1934 with the first professorship of musicology in America,&lt;ref&gt;Anne Pecheux Lang letter,&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly began changing the way music was taught there by adding courses, such as the esthetics of music, and by expanding the musicology department. In 1940, after Bartók fled Hungary during [[World War II]], Lang arranged for Columbia to hire him as an ethnomusicologist. As musicology was a nascent field at the time, Lang had a strong influence on its development, especially in the United States, and advised a number of students who would go on to become prominent musicologists, including [[James McKinnon]], [[Dika Newlin]], [[Joel Sachs]], [[Rose Rosengard Subotnik]], [[Richard Taruskin]], [[Piero Weiss]], and [[Neal Zaslaw]].

Lang became best known for his often provocative articles and books on both contemporary trends in music and music history. He was from 1954 to 1964 the music critic for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', succeeding [[Virgil Thomson]], and was editor of ''[[The Musical Quarterly]]'' from 1945 to 1973. He published a number of books, the most famous of which is ''[[Music in Western Civilization]]'' (1941), called "[a] model of scholarship and style"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Age of Faith|last = Durant|first = Will|publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster|year = 1950|isbn =|location = New York|pages = 1094}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Will Durant]]. He was an adviser to his publisher, W.W. Norton, and edited several books for them. He was a founding member of the American Musicological Society and in 1955 was elected for a term as president of the International Musicological Society.

In addition to his most famous work,  ''[[Music in Western Civilization]]'', Lang wrote  ''George Frideric Handel, '' collaborated with Otto Bettmann on ''A Pictorial History of Music,'' and edited several compilations, including  ''The Creative World of Mozart'' and  ''One Hundred Years of Music in America.''

In 1936 he married Anne Pecheux, a Barnard graduate who had taken his undergraduate music history course.  They had four children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6211">[[Polarization (waves)|Polarization]] is an important phenomenon in [[astronomy]]. 

==Stars==
The polarization of [[star#Radiation|starlight]] was first observed by the [[astronomer]]s [[William Hiltner]] and John S. Hall in 1949. Subsequently, [[Jesse Greenstein]] and [[Leverett Davis, Jr.]] developed theories allowing the use of polarization data to trace interstellar magnetic fields. 
Though the integrated [[thermal radiation]] of [[star]]s is not usually appreciably polarized at source, scattering by [[interstellar dust]] can impose polarization on starlight over long distances.  Net polarization at the source can occur if the [[photosphere]] itself is asymmetric, due to [[limb polarization]].  Plane polarization of starlight generated at the star itself is observed for [[Ap star]]s (peculiar A type stars).[https://web.archive.org/web/20040920073655/http://www.edpsciences.org/articles/eas/abs/2003/04/eas0928/eas0928.html]

==Sun==
Both [[circular polarization|circular]] and [[linear polarization]] of light from the Sun has been measured. Circular polarization is mainly due to transmission and absorption effects in strongly magnetic regions of the Sun's surface. Another mechanism that gives rise to circular polarization is the so-called "alignment-to-orientation mechanism". Continuum light is linearly polarized at different locations across the face of the Sun (limb polarization) though taken as a whole, this polarization cancels. Linear polarization in spectral lines is usually created by [[anisotropic scattering]] of photons on atoms and ions which can themselves be polarized by this interaction. The linearly polarized spectrum of the Sun is often called the [[second solar spectrum]]. [[Atomic polarization]] can be modified in weak magnetic fields by the [[Hanle effect]]. As a result, polarization of the scattered photons is also modified providing a diagnostics tool for understanding [[stellar magnetic field]]s.&lt;ref name=Landi&gt;{{cite book |author=Egidio Landi Degl'Innocenti|title=Polarization in Spectral Lines|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Dordrecht|date=2004|isbn=1-4020-2414-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other sources==
[[Image:Quasar 3C 286 as observed with ALMA.jpg|thumb|The polarization in the [[quasar]] [[3C 286]] measured with [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array|ALMA]]]]
Polarization is also present in radiation from [[coherent radiation|coherent]] astronomical sources due to the [[Zeeman effect]] (e.g. hydroxyl or methanol [[Astrophysical maser|masers]]).

The large radio lobes in [[Active galaxy|active galaxies]], and [[pulsar]] radio radiation (which may, it is speculated, sometimes be coherent) also show polarization. 

Apart from providing information on sources of radiation and scattering, polarization also probes the interstellar [[magnetic field]] in our Galaxy as well as in radio galaxies via [[Faraday rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Cosmic microwave background==
The polarization of the [[cosmic microwave background#polarization|cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) is also being used to study the physics of the very [[early universe]].&lt;ref name="boyle"&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=96|date=2006|pages=111301|first=Latham A.|last=Boyle|title=Inflationary predictions for scalar and tensor fluctuations reconsidered|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.111301|pmid=16605810|last2=Steinhardt|first2=PJ|last3=Turok|first3=N|issue=11|arxiv = astro-ph/0507455 |bibcode = 2006PhRvL..96k1301B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tegmark"&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Max|last=Tegmark|title=What does inflation really predict? | doi = 10.1088/1475-7516/2005/04/001|journal=JCAP|volume=0504|issue=4|pages=001|date=2005|arxiv=astro-ph/0410281|bibcode = 2005JCAP...04..001T }}&lt;/ref&gt; CMB exhibits 2 components of polarization: [[B-modes|B-mode]] (divergence-free like magnetic field) and [[B-modes|E-mode]] (curl-free gradient-only like electric field) polarization. The [[BICEP2]] telescope located at the South Pole helped in the detection of B-mode polarization in the CMB. The polarization modes of the CMB may provide more information about the influence of [[Gravitational Waves]] on the development of the early universe.

'''Positivism''' is a [[philosophical theory]] stating that certain ("positive") knowledge is based on [[natural phenomena]] and their properties and relations. Thus, information derived from [[sensory experience]], interpreted through [[reason]] and [[logic]], forms the exclusive source of all certain knowledge.&lt;ref name="MacionisGerber7ed"/&gt; Positivism holds that valid knowledge (certitude or [[truth]]) is found only in this [[A priori and a posteriori|''a posteriori'' knowledge]].

Verified data (positive facts) received from the senses are known as [[empirical evidence]]; thus positivism is based on [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="MacionisGerber7ed"&gt;John J. Macionis, Linda M. Gerber, ''Sociology'', Seventh Canadian Edition, [[Pearson Canada]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Positivism also holds that [[society]], like the physical world, operates according to general [[Scientific law|laws]]. [[Introspection|Introspective]] and [[intuitive knowledge]] is rejected, as are [[metaphysics]] and [[theology]] because metaphysical and theological claims cannot be verified by sense experience. Although the positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of western thought,&lt;ref name="Cohen, Manion et al." &gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Louis |year=2007 |title=Research Methods In Education |pages=9 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8527.2007.00388_4.x |journal=British Journal of Educational Studies |volume=55 |last2=Maldonado |first2=Antonio |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |issue=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the modern sense of the approach was formulated by the philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.sociologyguide.com/thinkers/Auguste-Comte.php |title=Auguste Comte | encyclopedia = Sociology Guide }}&lt;/ref&gt; Comte argued that, much as the physical world operates according to gravity and other absolute laws, so does society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sociology 14th Edition |last=Macionis |first=John J. |year=2012 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-205-11671-3 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and further developed positivism into a ''[[Religion of Humanity]]''.

==Etymology==
The English noun ''positivism'' was re-imported in the 19th century from the French word ''positivisme'', derived from ''positif'' in its philosophical sense of 'imposed on the mind by experience'. The corresponding adjective (lat. ''positīvus'') has been used in a similar sense to discuss law ([[positive law]] compared to [[natural law]]) since the time of [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Le petit Robert'' s. v. ''positivisme''; ''OED'' s. v. ''positive''&lt;/ref&gt;''

==Overview==

===Antecedents===
Positivism is part of a more general ancient quarrel between [[philosophy]] and [[poetry]], notably laid out by [[Plato]] and later reformulated as a quarrel between the sciences and the [[humanities]],&lt;ref name="Egan1997p114"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Egan |first1=Kieran |author-link1=Kieran Egan (educationist) |year=1997 |title=The Educated Mind |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=115–116 |isbn=978-0-226-19036-5|quote=Positivism is marked by the final recognition that science provides the only valid form of knowledge and that facts are the only possible objects of knowledge; philosophy is thus recognized as essentially no different from science [...] Ethics, politics, social interactions, and all other forms of human life about which knowledge was possible would eventually be drawn into the orbit of science [...] The positivists' program for mapping the inexorable and immutable laws of matter and society seemed to allow no greater role for the contribution of poets than had Plato. [...] What Plato represented as the quarrel between philosophy and poetry is resuscitated in the "two cultures" quarrel of more recent times between the humanities and the sciences.|title-link=The Educated Mind }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato elaborates a critique of poetry from the point of view of philosophy in his dialogues ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' 245a, ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' 209a, ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' 398a, ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' 817 b-d and ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, T. J. ''Introduction to Ion.'' London: [[Penguin Books]], 1987, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] (1833–1911) popularized the distinction between [[Geisteswissenschaft]] (humanities) and Naturwissenschaften ([[natural science|natural sciences]]).&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA27 p.27]&lt;/ref&gt;

The consideration that laws in physics may not be absolute but relative, and, if so, this might be more true of social sciences,&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"/&gt; was stated, in different terms, by [[G. B. Vico]] in 1725.&lt;ref&gt;Giambattista Vico, ''Principi di scienza nuova'', ''Opere'', ed. Fausto Nicolini (Milan: R. Ricciardi, 1953), p. 365–905.&lt;/ref&gt; Vico, in contrast to the positivist movement, asserted the superiority of the science of the human mind (the humanities, in other words), on the grounds that natural sciences tell us nothing about the inward aspects of things.&lt;ref name="MoreraEsteve1990p13"&gt;Morera, Esteve (1990) [https://books.google.com/books?id=I44OAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13 p.13 ''Gramsci's Historicism: A Realist Interpretation'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Positivists===
Positivism asserts that all authentic knowledge allows verification and that all authentic knowledge assumes that the only valid knowledge is scientific.&lt;ref name="Larrain1979p197"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Larrain |first1=Jorge |year=1979 |title=The Concept of Ideology |location=London |publisher=Hutchinson |page=197 |quote=one of the features of positivism is precisely its postulate that scientific knowledge is the paradigm of valid knowledge, a postulate that indeed is never proved nor intended to be proved.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers such as [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825), [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749–1827) and [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) believed the [[scientific method]], the circular dependence of theory and observation, must replace [[metaphysics]] in the [[history]] of thought.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} [[Émile Durkheim]] (1858–1917) reformulated sociological positivism as a foundation of [[social research]].&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-104"&gt;{{cite book |author=Craig J.

[[Wilhelm Dilthey]] (1833–1911), in contrast, fought strenuously against the assumption that only explanations derived from science are valid.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; He reprised the argument, already found in Vico, that scientific explanations do not reach the inner nature of phenomena&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; and it is humanistic [[knowledge]] that gives us insight into thoughts, feelings and desires.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt; Dilthey was in part influenced by the [[Historism|historicism]] of [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795–1886).&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p27" /&gt;

===Antipositivism===
{{main article|Antipositivism}}
At the turn of the 20th century the first wave of German sociologists, including [[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]], rejected the doctrine, thus founding the antipositivist tradition in sociology. Later antipositivists and [[critical theorist]]s have associated positivism with "[[scientism]]"; science ''as [[ideology]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Habermas]], ''Technik und Wissenschaft als Ideologie'', Frankfurt am Main: [[Suhrkamp]], 1968, chap. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his career (1969),&lt;ref&gt;Heisenberg (1969) ''[[The Part and The Whole]]''&lt;/ref&gt; German theoretical physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]], Nobel laureate for pioneering work in [[quantum mechanics]], distanced himself from positivism by saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;The positivists have a simple solution: the world must be divided into that which we can say clearly and the rest, which we had better pass over in silence. But can any one conceive of a more pointless philosophy, seeing that what we can say clearly amounts to next to nothing? If we omitted all that is unclear we would probably be left with completely uninteresting and trivial tautologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heisenberg|first=Werner|authorlink=Werner Heisenberg|editor=Ruth Nanda Nanshen|others=Translator: [[Arnold J. Pomerans]]|title=Werner Heisenberg - Physics and Beyond - Encounters and Conversations|series=World Perspectives|volume=42|year=1971|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York|page=213|chapter=Positivism, Metaphysics and Religion|lccn=78095963|oclc=15379872}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Logical positivism and postpositivism===
{{main article|Logical positivism|Postpositivism}}
In the early 20th century, logical positivism—a descendant of Comte's basic thesis but an independent movement—sprang up in [[Vienna Circle|Vienna]] and grew to become one of the dominant schools in Anglo-American philosophy and the [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] tradition. Logical positivists (or 'neopositivists') rejected metaphysical speculation and attempted to reduce statements and propositions to pure [[logic]]. Strong critiques of this approach by philosophers such as [[Karl Popper]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] have been highly influential, and led to the development of [[postpositivism]].

===In historiography===
In [[historiography]] the debate on positivism has been characterized by the quarrel between positivism and [[historicism]].&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"/&gt; (Historicism is also sometimes termed ''[[historism]]'' in the German tradition.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Boudon]] and [[François Bourricaud]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=O9ae9kWCtHkC&amp;pg=PA198 ''A Critical Dictionary of Sociology''], [[Routledge]], 1989: "Historicism", p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against positivist approaches in historiography include that [[history]] differs from sciences like [[physics]] and [[ethology]] in [[Theory|subject matter]] and [[Methodology|method]].&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"/&gt; That much of what history studies is nonquantifiable, and therefore to quantify is to lose in precision. Experimental methods and mathematical models do not generally apply to history, and it is not possible to formulate general (quasi-absolute) laws in history.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p28"&gt;Wallace and Gach (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA28 p.28]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In other fields===
Positivism in the social sciences is usually characterized by [[quantitative approach]]es and the proposition of quasi-absolute laws. A significant exception to this trend is represented by [[cultural anthropology]], which tends naturally toward [[qualitative research|qualitative]] approaches.&lt;ref name="Wallace2008p14"&gt;Wallace, Edwin R.  and Gach, John (2008) ''History of Psychiatry and Medical Psychology: With an Epilogue on Psychiatry and the Mind-Body Relation.'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=64Y6wtqzs7IC&amp;pg=PA14 p.14]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[psychology]] the positivist movement was influential in the development of [[operationalism]]. The 1927 philosophy of science book ''[[The Logic of Modern Physics]]'' in particular, which was originally intended for physicists, coined the term [[operational definition]], which went on to dominate psychological method for the whole century.&lt;ref name="Koch1992p275"&gt;Koch, Sigmund (1992) ''Psychology's Bridgman vs. Bridgman's Bridgman: An Essay in Reconstruction.'', in ''Theory and Psychology'' vol. 2 no. 3  (1992) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[economics]], practising researchers tend to emulate the methodological assumptions of classical positivism, but only in a ''de facto'' fashion: the majority of economists do not explicitly concern themselves with matters of epistemology.&lt;ref name="Boland2012"&gt;[http://positivists.org/blog/economic-positivism Lawrence A. Boland, ''Economic Positivism'' positivists.org 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic thinker Friedrich Hayek (see  "Law, Legislation and Liberty") rejected positivism in the social sciences as hopelessly limited in comparison to evolved and divided knowledge. For example, much (positivist) legislation falls short in contrast to pre-literate or incompletely defined common or evolved law. In [[jurisprudence]], "[[legal positivism]]" essentially refers to the rejection of [[natural law]]; thus its common meaning with philosophical positivism is somewhat attenuated and in recent generations generally emphasizes the authority of human political structures as opposed to a "scientific" view of law.

In the early 1970s, urbanists of the positivist-quantitative school like [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] started to question the positivist approach itself, saying that the arsenal of scientific theories and methods developed so far in their camp were "incapable of saying anything of depth and profundity" on the real problems of contemporary cities.&lt;ref name="Portugali2012p51"&gt;Portugali, Juval and Han Meyer, Egbert Stolk (2012) ''Complexity Theories of Cities Have Come of Age'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=2VZCQhvfBpIC&amp;pg=PA51 p.51]&lt;/ref&gt;

===In 20th century sociology===
In contemporary social science, strong accounts of positivism have long since fallen out of favour. Practitioners of positivism today acknowledge in far greater detail [[observer bias]] and structural limitations. Modern positivists generally eschew metaphysical concerns in favour of methodological debates concerning clarity, [[replicability]], [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]].&lt;ref name="Gartell"&gt;Gartell, David, and Gartell, John. 1996. "Positivism in sociological practice: 1967-1990". ''Canadian Review of Sociology'', Vol. 33 No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; This positivism is generally equated with "[[quantitative research]]" and thus carries no explicit theoretical or philosophical commitments. The institutionalization of this kind of sociology is often credited to [[Paul Lazarsfeld]],&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analyzing them. This approach lends itself to what [[Robert K. Merton]] called [[Middle range theory (sociology)|middle-range theory]]: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.&lt;ref name="Boudon"&gt;Boudon, Raymond.  1991.  "Review: What Middle-Range Theories are".  Contemporary Sociology, Vol. 20 Num. 4 pp 519-522.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In 21st century sociology===
Other new movements, such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], have emerged to reconcile the overarching aims of social science with postmodern critiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Macionis|first=John|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Education Canada|isbn=978-0-13-800270-1|pages=688}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Straker|first=David|title=Positivism|url=http://changingminds.org/explanations/research/philosophies/positivism.htm|publisher=changingminds.org|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now at least twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"&gt;Halfpenny, Peter. ''Positivism and Sociology: Explaining Social Life.'' London:Allen and Unwin, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological positivism==

===Comte's positivism===
[[File:Buste Auguste Comte.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Auguste Comte]]]]
[[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) first described the epistemological perspective of positivism in ''[[The Course in Positive Philosophy]]'', a series of texts published between 1830 and 1842. These texts were followed by the 1844 work, ''[[A General View of Positivism]]'' (published in French 1848, English in 1865). The first three volumes of the ''Course'' dealt chiefly with the physical sciences already in existence ([[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), whereas the latter two emphasized the inevitable coming of [[social science]]. Observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science, and classifying the sciences in this way, Comte may be regarded as the first [[philosopher of science]] in the modern sense of the term.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/comte/ Auguste Comte] in [[Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the physical sciences had necessarily to arrive first, before humanity could adequately channel its efforts into the most challenging and complex "Queen science" of human society itself. His ''View of Positivism'' therefore set out to define the empirical goals of sociological method.

{{quotation|"The most important thing to determine was the natural order in which the sciences stand—not how they can be made to stand, but how they must stand, irrespective of the wishes of any one. ... This Comte accomplished by taking as the criterion of the position of each the degree of what he called "positivity," which is simply the degree to which the phenomena can be exactly determined. This, as may be readily seen, is also a measure of their relative complexity, since the exactness of a science is in inverse proportion to its complexity. The degree of exactness or positivity is, moreover, that to which it can be subjected to mathematical demonstration, and therefore mathematics, which is not itself a concrete science, is the general gauge by which the position of every science is to be determined. Generalizing thus, Comte found that there were five great groups of phenomena of equal classificatory value but of successively decreasing positivity. To these he gave the names astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and sociology."|[[Lester F. Ward]], ''The Outlines of Sociology'' (1898)|&lt;ref name="DinW"/&gt;}}

Comte offered an [[social evolutionism|account of social evolution]], proposing that society undergoes three phases in its quest for the truth according to a general "[[law of three stages]]". The idea bears some similarity to [[Marx]]'s belief that human society would progress toward a [[communist]] peak (see [[dialectical materialism]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} This is perhaps unsurprising as both were profoundly influenced by the early [[Utopian socialist]], [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], who was at one time Comte's mentor. Comte intended to develop a secular-scientific ideology in the wake of European [[secularisation]].

Comte's stages were (1) the ''[[theological]]'', (2) the ''[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]]'', and (3) the ''positive''.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 1&lt;/ref&gt; The theological phase of man was based on whole-hearted belief in all things with reference to [[God]]. God, Comte says, had reigned supreme over human existence pre-[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Humanity's place in society was governed by its association with the divine presences and with the church. The theological phase deals with humankind's accepting the doctrines of the church (or place of worship) rather than relying on its rational powers to explore basic questions about existence. It dealt with the restrictions put in place by the religious organization at the time and the total acceptance of any "fact" adduced for society to believe.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'' 3&lt;/ref&gt; Comte describes the metaphysical phase of humanity as the time since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], a time steeped in logical [[rationalism]], to the time right after the [[French Revolution]]. This second phase states that the universal rights of humanity are most important. The central idea is that humanity is invested with certain rights that must be respected. In this phase, democracies and dictators rose and fell in attempts to maintain the innate rights of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard von Mises]], ''Positivism: A Study In Human Understanding'', 5 (Paperback, [[Dover Books]], 1968 {{ISBN|0-486-21867-8}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The final stage of the trilogy of Comte's universal law is the scientific, or positive, stage. The central idea of this phase is that individual rights are more important than the rule of any one person. Comte stated that the idea of humanity's ability to govern itself makes this stage inherently different from the rest. There is no higher power governing the masses and the intrigue of any one person can achieve anything based on that individual's free will. The third principle is most important in the positive stage.&lt;ref&gt;Mill, ''Auguste Comte and Positivism'', 4&lt;/ref&gt; Comte calls these three phases the universal rule in relation to society and its development. Neither the second nor the third phase can be reached without the completion and understanding of the preceding stage. All stages must be completed in progress.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Giddens, ''Positivism and Sociology'', 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Comte believed that the appreciation of the past and the ability to build on it towards the future was key in transitioning from the theological and metaphysical phases. The idea of progress was central to Comte's new science, sociology. Sociology would "lead to the historical consideration of every science" because "the history of one science, including pure political history, would make no sense unless it was attached to the study of the general progress of all of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pickering, ''Auguste Comte: An Intellectual Biography'', Volume I, 622&lt;/ref&gt; As Comte would say: "from science comes prediction; from prediction comes action."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Pickering, ''Auguste Comte: An Intellectual Biography'', Volume I, 566&lt;/ref&gt; It is a philosophy of human intellectual development that culminated in science. The irony of this series of phases is that though Comte attempted to prove that human development has to go through these three stages, it seems that the positivist stage is far from becoming a realization. This is due to two truths: The positivist phase requires having a complete understanding of the universe and world around us and requires that society should never know if it is in this positivist phase. [[Anthony Giddens]] argues that since humanity constantly uses science to discover and research new things, humanity never progresses beyond the second metaphysical phase.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
[[File:Templo Positivista em Porto Alegre.JPG|thumb|right|Positivist temple in [[Porto Alegre]], Brazil]]
Comte's fame today owes in part to [[Emile Littré]], who founded ''The Positivist Review'' in 1867. As an approach to the [[philosophy of history]], positivism was appropriated by historians such as [[Hippolyte Taine]]. Many of Comte's writings were translated into English by the [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] writer, [[Harriet Martineau]], regarded by some as the first female sociologist. Debates continue to rage as to how much Comte appropriated from the work of his mentor, Saint-Simon.&lt;ref&gt;Pickering, Mary (1993) ''Auguste Comte: an intellectual biography'' Cambridge University Press, pp. 192&lt;/ref&gt; He was nevertheless influential: Brazilian thinkers turned to Comte's ideas about training a scientific elite in order to flourish in the industrialization process. [[Brazil]]'s national [[motto]], ''Ordem e Progresso'' ("Order and Progress") was taken from the positivism motto, "Love as principle, order as the basis, progress as the goal", which was also influential in [[Positivism in Poland|Poland]].

In later life, Comte developed a '[[religion of humanity]]' for positivist societies in order to fulfil the cohesive function once held by traditional worship. In 1849, he proposed a [[calendar reform]] called the '[[positivist calendar]]'. For close associate [[John Stuart Mill]], it was possible to distinguish between a "good Comte" (the author of the ''Course in Positive Philosophy'') and a "bad Comte" (the author of the secular-religious ''system'').&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; The ''system'' was unsuccessful but met with the publication of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' to influence the proliferation of various [[Secular Humanist]] organizations in the 19th century, especially through the work of secularists such as [[George Holyoake]] and [[Richard Congreve]]. Although Comte's English followers, including [[George Eliot]] and Harriet Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity and his injunction to "vivre pour autrui" ("live for others", from which comes the word "[[altruism]]").&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organized around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)" According to Davies (p. 28-29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early sociology of [[Herbert Spencer]] came about broadly as a reaction to Comte; writing after various developments in evolutionary biology, Spencer attempted (in vain) to reformulate the discipline in what we might now describe as [[social Darwinism|socially Darwinistic]] terms.

===Proletarian positivism===
[[Fabien Magnin]] was the first working class adherent to Comte's ideas. Comte appointed him as his successor as president of the Positive Society in the event of Comte's death. Magnin filled this role from 1857 to 1880, when he resigned.&lt;ref name="Pickering"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickering|first1=Mary|title=Auguste Comte: Volume 3: An Intellectual Biography|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnin was in touch with the English positivists [[Richard Congreve]] and [[Edward Spencer Beesly]]. He established the [[Cercle des prolétaires positivistes]] in 1863 which was affiliated to the [[First International]]. [[Eugène Sémérie]] was a psychiatrist who was also involved in the Positivist movement, setting up a positivist club in Paris after the foundation of the [[French Third Republic]] in 1870. "Positivism is not only a philosophical doctrine, it is also a political party which claims to reconcile order – the necessary basis for all social activity – with Progress, which is its goal." he wrote.&lt;ref name="FPC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sémérie|first1=Eugène|title=Founding of a Positivist Club|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/comte/1870/semerie.htm|website=Marxists Internet Archive|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Durkheim's positivism===
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
The modern academic discipline of sociology began with the work of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917). While Durkheim rejected much of the details of Comte's philosophy, he retained and refined its method, maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity, and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity, rationalism, and approach to causality.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the [[University of Bordeaux]] in 1895, publishing his ''[[Rules of the Sociological Method]]'' (1895).&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;Gianfranco Poggi (2000). ''Durkheim.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this text he argued: "[o]ur main goal is to extend scientific rationalism to human conduct... What has been called our positivism is but a consequence of this rationalism."&lt;ref name="DinW"&gt;Durkheim, Emile. 1895.  ''[[The Rules of the Sociological Method]]''.  Cited in Wacquant (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's seminal monograph, ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]'' (1897), a case study of suicide rates amongst [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] populations, distinguished sociological analysis from [[psychology]] or philosophy. By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts, he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than Protestants, something he attributed to social (as opposed to individual or psychological) causes. He developed the notion of objective ''[[sui generis]]'' "[[social facts]]" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; Through such studies, he posited, sociology would be able to determine whether a given society is 'healthy' or 'pathological', and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or "social [[anomie]]". Durkheim described sociology as the "science of [[institution]]s, their genesis and their functioning".&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Émile [1895] "The Rules of Sociological Method" 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E. G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), pp. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashley Ornstein has alleged, in a consumer textbook published by [[Pearson Education]], that accounts of Durkheim's positivism are possibly exaggerated and oversimplified; Comte was the only major sociological thinker to postulate that the social realm may be subject to scientific analysis in exactly the same way as natural science, whereas Durkheim saw a far greater need for a distinctly sociological scientific methodology. His lifework was fundamental in the establishment of practical [[social research]] as we know it today—techniques which continue beyond sociology and form the methodological basis of other [[social sciences]], such as [[political science]], as well of [[market research]] and other fields.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements11"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, US |year=2005 |pages=94–98, 100–104|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antipositivism and critical theory===
{{Main article|Antipositivism|Critical theory}}
At the turn of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists formally introduced methodological antipositivism, proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural [[Norm (sociology)|norms]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[symbols]], and social processes viewed from a [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]] perspective. [[Max Weber]] argued that sociology may be loosely described as a 'science' as it is able to identify causal relationships—especially among [[ideal type]]s, or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena.&lt;ref name="Classical Statements5"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |pages=239–240 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a nonpositivist, however, one seeks relationships that are not as "ahistorical, invariant, or generalizable"&lt;ref name="Classical Statements6"&gt;{{cite book |author=Ashley D, Orenstein DM |title=Sociological theory: Classical statements (6th ed.) |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Boston, MA, USA |year=2005 |page=241 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as those pursued by natural scientists. Weber regarded sociology as the study of [[social action]], using critical analysis and [[verstehen]] techniques. The sociologists [[Georg Simmel]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], [[George Herbert Mead]], and [[Charles Cooley]] were also influential in the development of sociological antipositivism, whilst [[neo-Kantian]] philosophy, [[hermeneutics]], and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] facilitated the movement in general.

[[Karl Marx|Karl Marx's]] theory of [[historical materialism]] and critical analysis drew upon positivism,&lt;ref&gt;"Main Currents of Marxism" by Leszek Kolakowski page 331, 327,&lt;/ref&gt; a tradition which would continue in the development of [[critical theory]]. However, following in the tradition of both [[Max Weber|Weber]] and [[Marx]], the critical theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] has critiqued pure [[instrumental rationality]] (in its relation to the cultural [[rationalisation (sociology)|"rationalisation"]] of the modern West) as meaning that scientific thinking becomes something akin to [[ideology]] itself. Positivism may be espoused by "[[Technocracy|technocrats]]" who believe in the inevitability of [[social progress]] through science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Schunk, ''Learning Theories: An Educational Perspective, 5th'', 315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Outhwaite, William, 1988 ''Habermas: Key Contemporary Thinkers'', Polity Press (Second Edition 2009), {{ISBN|978-0-7456-4328-1}} p.68&lt;/ref&gt; New movements, such as [[critical realism (philosophy of the social sciences)|critical realism]], have emerged in order to reconcile postpositivist aims with various so-called '[[Postmodernism|postmodern]]' perspectives on the social acquisition of knowledge.

===Contemporary positivism===
In the original Comtean usage, the term "positivism" roughly meant the use of scientific methods to uncover the laws according to which both physical and human events occur, while "sociology" was the overarching science that would synthesize all such knowledge for the betterment of society. "Positivism is a way of understanding based on science"; people don't rely on the faith of God but instead of the science behind humanity. "Antipositivism" formally dates back to the start of the twentieth century, and is based on the belief that natural and human sciences are ontologically and epistemologically distinct. Neither of these terms is used any longer in this sense.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"&gt;Wacquant, Loic.  1992.  "Positivism." In Bottomore, Tom and William Outhwaite, ed., ''The Blackwell Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Social Thought''&lt;/ref&gt; There are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism.&lt;ref name="Halfpenny"/&gt;  Many of these approaches do not self-identify as "positivist", some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism, and some because the label has over time become a term of abuse&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt; by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical [[empiricism]]. The extent of antipositivist criticism has also become broad, with many philosophies broadly rejecting the scientifically based social epistemology and other ones only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th century developments in the philosophy of science.  However, positivism (understood as the use of scientific methods for studying society) remains the dominant approach to both the research and the theory construction in contemporary sociology, especially in the United States.&lt;ref name="Wacquant"/&gt;

The majority of articles published in leading American sociology and political science journals today are positivist (at least to the extent of being [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] rather than [[qualitative research|qualitative]]).&lt;ref name="holmes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="brett"&gt;Brett, Paul. 1994. "A genre analysis of the results section of sociology articles". ''English For Specific Purposes''. Vol 13, Num 1:47–59.&lt;/ref&gt; This popularity may be because research utilizing positivist quantitative methodologies holds a greater prestige{{clarify|date=November 2012}} in the social sciences than qualitative work; quantitative work is easier to justify, as data can be manipulated to answer any question.&lt;ref name="gm"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Linda |last1=Grant |first2=Kathryn B. |last2=Ward |author3=Xue Lan Rong |title=Is There An Association between Gender and Methods in Sociological Research? |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=52 |issue=6 |year=1987 |pages=856–862 |jstor=2095839|doi=10.2307/2095839 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=November 2012}} Such research is generally perceived as being more scientific and more trustworthy, and thus has a greater impact on policy and public opinion (though such judgments are frequently contested by scholars doing non-positivist work).&lt;ref name="gm"/&gt;{{qn|date=November 2012}}

===The role of science in social change===
The contestation over positivism is reflected in older (see the [[Positivism dispute]]) and current debates over the proper role of science in the public sphere. [[Public sociology]]—especially as described by [[Michael Burawoy]]—argues that sociologists should use empirical evidence to display the problems of society so they might be changed.&lt;ref&gt;Burawoy, Michael: [http://burawoy.berkeley.edu/PS/ASA%20Presidential%20Address.pdf "For Public Sociology"] ([[American Sociological Review]], February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Thibodeaux&lt;ref&gt;Thibodeaux, Jarrett. 2016. Production as Social Change: Policy Sociology as a Public Good. Sociological Spectrum. 36 (3): 183–190.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that critical theory—public sociology in particular—relies on a dialectical, unilineal evolutionary view of social change. If a public sociologists assumes a multi-lineal interpretation of social change, public sociology will fail to affect social change for three reasons: (1) there's no objective criteria for the assessment of different goals (2) the rejection of one goal does not necessarily lead to an adherence to some other particular goal and (3) criticizing a goal maintains its relevance at the expense of possible alternatives.

==Logical positivism==
{{Main article|Logical positivism}}
[[File:Schlick sitting.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Moritz Schlick]], the founding father of logical positivism and the [[Vienna Circle]].]]
[[Logical positivism]] (later and more accurately called logical empiricism) is a school of philosophy that combines [[empiricism]], the idea that observational evidence is indispensable for knowledge of the world, with a version of [[rationalism]], the idea that our knowledge includes a component that is not derived from observation.

Logical positivism grew from the discussions of a group called the "First Vienna Circle" which gathered at the [[Café Central]] before [[World War I]]. After the war [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], a member of that early group, helped bring [[Moritz Schlick]] to Vienna. Schlick's [[Vienna Circle]], along with [[Hans Reichenbach]]'s [[Berlin Circle (philosophy)|Berlin Circle]], propagated the new doctrines more widely in the 1920s and early 1930s.

It was [[Otto Neurath]]'s advocacy that made the movement self-conscious and more widely known. A 1929 pamphlet written by Neurath, Hahn, and [[Rudolf Carnap]] summarized the doctrines of the Vienna Circle at that time. These included: the opposition to all [[metaphysics]], especially [[ontology]] and [[synthetic a priori|synthetic ''a priori'']] propositions; the rejection of metaphysics not as wrong but as meaningless (i.e., not empirically verifiable); a criterion of meaning based on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s early work (which he himself later set out to refute){{citation needed|date=August 2016}}; the idea that all knowledge should be codifiable in a single standard language of science; and above all the project of "rational reconstruction," in which ordinary-language concepts were gradually to be replaced by more precise equivalents in that standard language. However, the project is widely considered to have failed.&lt;ref name="Bunge1996"&gt;{{cite book |first=M. A. |last=Bunge |year=1996 |title=Finding Philosophy in Social Science |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=9780300066067 |lccn=lc96004399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YAV43gVMsIC&amp;pg=PA317 |page=317 |quote=To conclude, logical positivism was progressive compared with the classical positivism of Ptolemy, Hume, d'Alembert, Compte, Mill, and Mach. It was even more so by comparison with its contemporary rivals—neo-Thomisism, neo-Kantianism, intuitionism, dialectical materialism, phenomenology, and existentialism. However, neo-positivism failed dismally to give a faithful account of science, whether natural or social. It failed because it remained anchored to sense-data and to a phenomenalist metaphysics, overrated the power of induction and underrated that of hypothesis, and denounced realism and materialism as metaphysical nonsense. Although it has never been practiced consistently in the advanced natural sciences and has been criticized by many philosophers, notably Popper (1959 [1935], 1963), logical positivism remains the tacit philosophy of many scientists. Regrettably, the anti-positivism fashionable in the metatheory of social science is often nothing but an excuse for sloppiness and wild speculation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drury.edu/ess/philsci/popper.html |title=Popper, Falsifiability, and the Failure of Positivism |date=7 August 2000 |accessdate=30 June 2012 |quote=The upshot is that the positivists seem caught between insisting on the V.C.

After moving to the United States, Carnap proposed a replacement for the earlier doctrines in his ''Logical Syntax of Language''. This change of direction, and the somewhat differing beliefs of Reichenbach and others, led to a consensus that the English name for the shared doctrinal platform, in its American exile from the late 1930s, should be "logical empiricism."{{cn|date=February 2018}} While the logical positivism movement is now considered dead, it has continued to influence philosophy development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanfling|first=Oswald|chapter=Logical Positivism|title=Routledge History of Philosophy|volume=IX|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|pages=193–194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical positivism==
Historical positivism is the [[historiography|historiographical]] view that historical evidence requires no interpretation, the work of the historian being to compile the primary sources, “letting them speak for themselves”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://colegiomoz.blogspot.com/2017/11/historiografia-positivista.html?m=1 | title=Historiografia positivista - Colégio-moz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of its tenets were later contradicted by [[Postmodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Postmodernism and the Holocaust, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further thinkers&lt;!--'Popper legend' redirects here--&gt;==
Within years of the publication of  [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]'s book ''A General View of Positivism'' (1848), other scientific and philosophical thinkers began creating their own definitions for positivism. They included [[Émile Zola]], [[Emile Hennequin]], [[Wilhelm Scherer]], and [[Dimitri Pisarev]]. Émile Zola was an influential French [[novelist]], the most important example of the literary school of [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], and a major figure in the political liberalization of [[France]].

Emile Hennequin was a Parisian publisher and writer who wrote theoretical and critical pieces. He "exemplified the tension between the positivist drive to systematize literary criticism and the unfettered imagination inherent in literature." He was one of the few thinkers who disagreed with the notion that subjectivity invalidates observation, judgment and prediction. Unlike many positivist thinkers before him, he believed that [[subjectivity]] does play a role in science and society. His contribution to positivism pertains not to science and its objectivity, but rather to the subjectivity of art and the way artists, their work, and audiences interrelate. Hennequin tried to analyse positivism strictly on the predictions, and the mechanical processes, but was perplexed due to the contradictions of the reactions of patrons to artwork that showed no scientific inclinations.

Wilhelm Scherer was a German [[Philology|philologist]], a university professor, and a popular literary historian. He was known as a positivist because he based much of his work on "hypotheses on detailed historical research, and rooted every literary phenomenon in 'objective' historical or philological facts". His positivism is different due to his involvement with his nationalist goals. His major contribution to the movement was his speculation that culture cycled in a six-hundred-year period.

Dimitri Pisarev was a Russian critic who showed the greatest contradictions with his belief in positivism. His ideas incorporated imagination and style though he did not believe in romantic ideas because they reminded him of the oppressive tsarist government under which he lived. His basic beliefs were "an extreme anti-aesthetic scientistic position." He focused his efforts on defining the relation between literature and the environment.

[[File:Stephen Hawking.StarChild.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Stephen Hawking]]]]
[[Stephen Hawking]] was a recent high-profile advocate of positivism, at least in the physical sciences. In ''[[The Universe in a Nutshell]]'' (p.&amp;nbsp;31) he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Any sound scientific theory, whether of time or of any other concept, should in my opinion be based on the most workable philosophy of science: the positivist approach put forward by [[Karl Popper]] and others. According to this way of thinking, a scientific theory is a mathematical model that describes and codifies the observations we make. A good theory will describe a large range of phenomena on the basis of a few simple postulates and will make definite predictions that can be tested. ... If one takes the positivist position, as I do, one cannot say what time actually is. All one can do is describe what has been found to be a very good mathematical model for time and say what predictions it makes.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, the claim that Popper was a positivist is a common misunderstanding that Popper himself termed the "'''Popper legend'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;."&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Stadler]], ''The Vienna Circle: Studies in the Origins, Development, and Influence of Logical Empiricism'', Springer, 2015, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he developed his beliefs in stark opposition to and as a criticism of positivism and held that scientific theories talk about how the world really is, not, as positivists claim, about phenomena or observations experienced by scientists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]'', 1934, 1959 (1st English ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; In the same vein, [[Continental philosophy|continental philosophers]] like [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Jürgen Habermas]] regarded Popper as a positivist because of his alleged devotion to a [[unified science]]. However, this was also part of the "Popper legend"; Popper had in fact been the foremost critic of this doctrine of the Vienna Circle, critiquing it, for instance, in his ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''[[Conjectures and Refutations]]'', p256 [[Routledge]], London, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==In science today==
{{See also|Constructive empiricism}}
The key features of positivism as of the 1950s, as defined in the "received view",&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, I. (ed.) 1981. Scientific revolutions. - Oxford Univ. Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; are:
# A focus on science as a product, a linguistic or numerical set of statements;
# A concern with [[axiomatization]], that is, with demonstrating the logical structure and coherence of these statements;
# An insistence on at least some of these statements being testable; that is, amenable to being verified, confirmed, or shown to be false by the empirical observation of reality.  Statements that would, by their nature, be regarded as untestable included the [[teleology|teleological]]; thus positivism rejects much of classical metaphysics.
# The belief that science is markedly cumulative;
# The belief that science is predominantly [[Trans-cultural diffusion|transcultural]];
# The belief that science rests on specific results that are dissociated from the personality and social position of the investigator;
# The belief that science contains theories or research traditions that are largely commensurable;
# The belief that science sometimes incorporates new ideas that are discontinuous from old ones;
# The belief that science involves the idea of the unity of science, that there is, underlying the various scientific disciplines, basically one science about one real world.
# The belief that science is nature and nature is science; and out of this duality, all theories and postulates are created, interpreted, evolve, and are applied.

Positivism is elsewhere{{Non sequitur|date=February 2018}}{{where|date=February 2018}} defined{{by who|date=February 2018}} as the belief that all true knowledge is scientific,&lt;ref name="bullock"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]] and [[Stephen Trombley]], [Eds] ''The Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', London: [[Harper-Collins]], 1999, pp. 669–737&lt;/ref&gt; and that all things are ultimately measurable. Positivism is closely related to [[reductionism]], in that both involve the belief that "entities of one kind... are reducible to entities of another,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; such as societies to configurations of individuals, or mental events to neural phenomena. It also involves the contention that "processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; and even that "social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals,"&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt; or that "biological organisms are reducible to physical systems."&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt;

While most social scientists today are not explicit about their epistemological commitments, articles in top American sociology and political science journals generally follow a positivist logic of argument.&lt;ref name="holmes"&gt;Holmes, Richard.  1997. "Genre analysis, and the social sciences: An investigation of the structure of research article discussion sections in three disciplines". ''English For Specific Purposes'', vol. 16, num. 4:321–337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brett"/&gt;  It can be thus argued that "natural science and social science [research articles] can therefore be regarded with a good deal of confidence as members of the same genre".&lt;ref name="holmes"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Positivism dispute}}
Historically, positivism has been criticized for its [[reductionism]], i.e., for contending that all "processes are reducible to physiological, physical or chemical events," "social processes are reducible to relationships between and actions of individuals," and that "biological organisms are reducible to physical systems."&lt;ref name="bullock"/&gt;

[[Max Horkheimer]] criticized the classic formulation of positivism on two grounds. First, he claimed that it falsely represented human social action.&lt;ref name="Fagan"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fagan|first=Andrew|title=Theodor Adorno (1903-1969)|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/adorno/|work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first criticism argued that positivism systematically failed to appreciate the extent to which the so-called social facts it yielded did not exist 'out there', in the objective world, but were themselves a product of socially and historically mediated human consciousness.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Positivism ignored the role of the 'observer' in the constitution of social reality and thereby failed to consider the historical and social conditions affecting the representation of social ideas.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Positivism falsely represented the object of study by [[Reification (fallacy)|reifying]] social reality as existing objectively and independently and labour actually produced those conditions.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; Secondly, he argued, representation of social reality produced by positivism was inherently and artificially conservative, helping to support the status quo, rather than challenging it.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt; This character may also explain the popularity of positivism in certain political circles. Horkheimer argued, in contrast, that critical theory possessed a reflexive element lacking in the positivistic traditional theory.&lt;ref name="Fagan"/&gt;

Some scholars today hold the beliefs critiqued in Horkheimer's work, but since the time of his writing critiques of positivism, especially from philosophy of science, have led to the development of [[postpositivism]]. This philosophy greatly relaxes the epistemological commitments of logical positivism and no longer claims a separation between the knower and the known. Rather than dismissing the scientific project outright, postpositivists seek to transform and amend it, though the exact extent of their affinity for science varies vastly. For example, some postpositivists accept the critique that observation is always value-laden, but argue that the best values to adopt for sociological observation are those of science: skepticism, rigor, and modesty. Just as some critical theorists see their position as a moral commitment to egalitarian values, these postpositivists see their methods as driven by a moral commitment to these scientific values. Such scholars may see themselves as either positivists or antipositivists.&lt;ref name="tittle"&gt;Tittle, Charles. 2004. "The Arrogance of Public Sociology". ''Social Forces'', June 2004, 82(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

Positivism has also come under fire on religious and philosophical grounds, whose proponents state that truth begins in [[empirical evidence|sense experience]], but does not end there. Positivism fails to prove that there are not abstract ideas, laws, and principles, beyond particular observable facts and relationships and necessary principles, or that we cannot know them. Nor does it prove that material and corporeal things constitute the whole order of existing beings, and that our knowledge is limited to them. According to positivism, our abstract concepts or general ideas are mere collective representations of the experimental order—for example; the idea of "man" is a kind of blended image of all the men observed in our experience. This runs contrary to a [[Platonism|Platonic]] or [[Christian]] ideal, where an idea can be abstracted from any concrete determination, and may be applied identically to an indefinite number of objects of the same class {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} From the idea's perspective, Platonism is more precise. Defining an idea as a sum of collective images is imprecise and more or less confused, and becomes more so as the collection represented increases. An idea defined explicitly always remains clear.

[[Experientialism]], which arose with second generation cognitive science, asserts that knowledge begins and ends with experience itself.&lt;ref&gt;Varela, F. J., Thompson, E. T., &amp; Rosch, E. (1991). ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience''. The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lakoff, G., &amp; Johnson, M. (1999). ''Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge to Western Thought''. Basic books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Echoes of the "positivist" and "antipositivist" debate persist today, though this conflict is hard to define. Authors writing in different epistemological perspectives do not phrase their disagreements in the same terms and rarely actually speak directly to each other.&lt;ref name="Hanson"&gt;Hanson, Barbara. 2008. "Wither Qualitative/Quantitative?: Grounds for Methodological Convergence." ''Quality and Quantity'' 42:97–111.&lt;/ref&gt; To complicate the issues further, few practicing scholars explicitly state their epistemological commitments, and their epistemological position thus has to be guessed from other sources such as choice of methodology or theory. However, no perfect correspondence between these categories exists, and many scholars critiqued as "positivists" are actually postpositivists.&lt;ref name="Bryman"&gt;Bryman, Alan. 1984. "The Debate about Quantitative and Qualitative Research: A Question of Method or Epistemology?." ''The British Journal of Sociology'' 35:75–92.&lt;/ref&gt; One scholar has described this debate in terms of the social construction of the "other", with each side defining the other by what it is ''not'' rather than what it ''is'', and then proceeding to attribute far greater homogeneity to their opponents than actually exists.&lt;ref name="Hanson"/&gt; Thus, it is better to understand this not as a debate but as two different arguments: the "antipositivist" articulation of a social [[meta-theory]] which includes a philosophical critique of [[scientism]], and "positivist" development of a scientific research methodology for sociology with accompanying critiques of the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] and [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of work that they see as violating such standards.

'''Production engineering''' is a combination of [[manufacturing]] technology, [[engineering]] sciences with [[management science]]. A production engineer typically has a wide knowledge of [[engineering]] practices and is aware of the management challenges related to production. The goal is to accomplish the production process in the smoothest, most-judicious and most-economic way.

Production engineering encompasses the application of [[Casting (metalworking)|castings]], machining processing, [[joiner|joining processes]], metal cutting &amp; tool design, [[metrology]], machine tools, [[machining]] systems, [[automation]], jigs and fixtures, die and mould design, material science, design of automobile parts, and machine designing and manufacturing.  Production engineering also overlaps substantially with [[manufacturing engineering]] and [[industrial engineering]].  The names are often interchangeable.

In [[industry]], once the design is realized, production engineering concepts regarding work-study, [[ergonomics]], [[operation research]], manufacturing management, [[materials management]], [[production planning]], etc., play important roles in efficient production processes. These deal with [[integrated design]] and efficient planning of the entire manufacturing system, which is becoming increasingly complex with the emergence of sophisticated production methods and control systems.

== Production engineer ==
The production engineer possesses a wide set of skills, competences and attitudes based on market and scientific knowledge. These abilities are fundamental for the performance of coordinating and integrating professionals of multidisciplinary teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dep.ufscar.br/curso.php |title=O  Engenheiro de Produção da UFSCar está apto a |trans-title=Production Engineer UFSCar is able to |language=Portuguese |publisher=Departamento de Engenharia de Produção (DEP) |accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production engineer should be able to:
* '''Scale and integrate resources.''' Usually required to consider physical, human and financial resources at high efficiency and low cost, yet considering the possibility of continuous further improvement;
* '''Make proper use of math and statistics''' to model production systems during decision making process;
* '''Design, implement and refine products, services, processes and systems''' taking in consideration that constraints and particularities of the related communities;
* '''Predict and analyze the demand'''. Select among scientific and technological appropriate knowledge in order to design, redesign or improve product/service functionality;
* '''Incorporate concepts and quality techniques''' along all the productive system. Deploy organizational standards for control proceedings and auditing;
* '''Stay up-to-date with technological developments''', enabling them to enterprises and society;
* '''Understand the relation between production systems and the environment'''. This relates to the use of scarce resources, production rejects and sustainability;
* '''Manage and optimize flow''' (information and production flow).

Work opportunities are available in [[Public sector|public]] and [[private sector]] manufacturing organizations engaged in implementation, development and management of new production processes, information and control systems, and computer controlled inspection, assembly and handling.

The nutritional requirements determined by the NRC are based on scientific evidence and used as the basis for nutritional adequacy in cats and dogs. However, these values are based on the assumption that the availability and digestibility of the nutrients are not variable, although in reality, this is not the case.  The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) also has recommended nutrient levels, but their values serve primarily as regulatory guidance. AAFCO bases their recommendations on feeding trials and are not necessarily supported by scientific evidence; however their nutritional adequacy statement on pet food bags is considered an important part of the label because their recommendations account for ingredient variability. Other agencies involved in pet food regulations include the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] in the United States who directly regulates the sales of pet food, the FEDIAF in Europe and PFIAA in Australia who recommend regulatory requirements for the pet food industry, as well as others. When selecting puppy food, it is important to consult the labels and ensure products meet the standards of regulatory agencies of your respective country.

== Energy ==
Young growing dogs require greater amounts of [[Food energy|energy]] per unit body mass than fully grown adult dogs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blanchard|first=G.|last2=Grandjean|first2=D.|last3=Paragon|first3=B.|year=1998|title=Calculation of a dietary plan for puppies|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition|volume=80|pages=54–59|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1439-0396.1998.tb00501.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; From time of weaning until the puppy reaches 40% of the adult body weight, the optimal energy intake per unit body weight is twice that of an adult dog of the same breed.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; From 40% to 80% of adult body weight, energy requirements decrease to 1.6 times the adult requirement, and from 80% to the end of growth, this decreases further to 1.2 times the adult energy requirement.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because of this, it is important to ensure that puppy diets contain higher amounts of energy than adult dog foods. However, over nutrition associated with feeding ''ad libitum'' results in accelerated skeletal growth and weight gain leading to osteopenia, especially in large breed dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dammrich|first=K.|year=1991|title=Relationship between nutrition and bone growth in large and giant dogs|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=121|pages=114–121|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, appropriate energy requirements should be met, but not exceeded in the growing dog.

Owners and puppy raisers should monitor their puppy’s weight gain by referencing a 9-point body condition score scale which is easily accessible on the internet, regularly weighing the puppy, and consulting with their veterinarian. Owners should also be mindful as to the energy level of their puppy; high energy level puppies will require more energy and may need to be fed extra amounts of food, just as lower energy puppies may require less food. The 9 point body condition score has been shown to be an effective method for estimating percent body fat in dogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mawby|first=D.I.|last2=Bartges|first2=J.W.|last3=d'Avignon|first3=A.|last4=Laflamme|first4=D.P.|last5=Moyers|first5=T.D.|last6=Cottrell|first6=T.|year=2004|title=Comparison of various methods for estimating body fat in dogs|url=|journal=Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association|volume=40|pages=109–114|via=|doi=10.5326/0400109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, by adhering to the 9 point body condition scale, and adjusting food intake accordingly, owners will be able to maintain their puppy at an appropriate weight throughout its growth. In addition to visual estimates of body condition, physical [[palpation]] of the pet can provide insight on general health and weight. Speaking to a licensed veterinarian can be very beneficial, as they can help develop these dietary and weight monitoring skills.

== Calcium and Phosphorus ==
An important aspect of the composition of puppy food is the [[calcium]] and [[phosphorus]] content. Bone mineral is composed mainly of calcium, which functions in skeletal mineralization during growth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Puppies younger than 5 months are not able to adjust the absorption of calcium in response to intake, therefore an oversupply or undersupply can be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dobenecker|first=B.|year=2002|title=The influence of calcium and phosphorus intake on the apparent digestibility of these minerals in growing dogs|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=132|pages=16655–16675|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When raised on diets deficient in calcium, pathological bone fractures can result.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tryfonidou|first=M.A.|last2=Holl|first2=M.S.|last3=Vastenburg|first3=M.|last4=Oosterlaken-Dijksterhuis|first4=M.A.|last5=Birkenhager-Frenkel|first5=D.H.|last6=van den Brom|first6=W.E.|last7=Hazewinkel|first7=H.A.|year=2003|title=Hormonal regulation of calcium homeostasis in two breeds of dogs during growth at different rates|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=81|pages=1568–1580|via=|doi=10.2527/2003.8161568x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fractures have been shown to occur in smaller breed puppies when their diet contained less than 0.33% calcium on a dry matter (DM) basis.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Larger breeds present with fractures at a calcium level of less than 0.55%, thus requiring these breeds to have greater calcium requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hazewinkel|first=H.W.|last2=van den Brom|first2=W.|last3=Van't Klooster|first3=A.|last4=Voorhout|first4=G.|last5=Van Wees|first5=A.|year=1991|title=Calcium metabolism in Great Dane dogs fed diets with various calcium and phosphorus levels|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=121|pages=99S-106S|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The ratio of calcium to phosphorus greatly impacts the retention of phosphorus. A ratio of 1.3:1 will allow for good phosphorus retention, but levels above a ratio of 2:1 will decrease phosphorus retention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schoenmakers|first=I.|last2=Hazewinkel|first2=H.|last3=Brom|first3=W.|year=1999|title=Excessive Ca and P intake during early maturation in dogs alters Ca and P balance without long-term effects after dietary normalization|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=129|pages=1068–1074|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raising puppies on diets containing excess calcium and phosphorus will result in [[osteochondrosis]] which disturbs bone remodeling and cartilage and bone maturation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goedegebuure|first=S.A.|last2=Hazewinkel|first2=H.A.|year=1986|title=Morphological findings in young dogs chronically fed a diet containing excess calcium|url=|journal=Veterinary Pathology|volume=23|pages=594–605|via=|doi=10.1177/030098588602300508}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes are noticed in larger breed puppies at lower levels of excess than in smaller breeds.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Because large breed puppies are more sensitive to deficient and excess calcium and phosphorus levels, it is important to ensure that their diets contain sufficient amounts of both.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The minimum requirement laid out by the NRC is 8.0g/kg DM calcium (0.8%), with a 12g/kg DM (1.2%) recommended allowance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, recommendations laid out by AAFCO consist of slightly higher calcium values; 1.2% to 1.8% on a DM basis, whereas phosphorus levels should be between 1.0% and 1.6%, with a ratio of calcium to phosphorus between 1:1 and 2:1.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aafco.org/Portals/0/SiteContent/Regulatory/Committees/Pet-Food/Reports/Pet_Food_Report_2013_Midyear-Proposed_Revisions_to_AAFCO_Nutrient_Profiles.pdf|title=AAFCO methods for substantiating nutritional adequacy of dog and cat foods|last=|first=|date=2014|website=AAFCO|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many commonly used ingredients, such as corn, which are added in high amounts to commercial dog foods do not contain adequate amounts of calcium, and as such, calcium supplements are often added to the formulation to ensure proper amounts for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ortin|first=W.G.N.|last2=Yu|first2=P.|year=2009|title=Nutrient variation and availability of wheat DDGS, corn DDGS and blend DDGS from bioethanol plants|url=|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|volume=89|pages=1757–1761|via=|doi=10.1002/jsfa.3652}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a descriptive study of over-the-counter maintenance dog foods determined that 4/45 of the foods studied contained calcium concentrations that exceeded the AAFCO recommendation, but were labeled for all life stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gagne|first=J.W.|last2=Wakshlag|first2=J.J.|last3=Center|first3=S.A.|last4=Rutzke|first4=M.A.|last5=Glahn|first5=R.P.|year=2013|title=Evaluation of calcium, phosphorus, and selected trace mineral status in commercially available dry foods formulated for dogs|url=|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=243|pages=658–666|via=|doi=10.2460/javma.243.5.658}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is important to feed a diet specifically recommended for the developmental life stage and consult the calcium and phosphorus levels in puppy foods.

== Fats and Fatty Acids ==
Fat is a nutrient that provides more energy per gram than all other nutrients.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Canine and Feline Nutrition: A Resource for Companion Animal Professionals|last=Case|first=L.P.|last2=Daristotle|first2=L.|last3=Hayek|first3=M.J.|last4=Raasch|first4=M.F.|publisher=Mosby|year=2000|isbn=|location=St. Louis, MO, USA|pages=17–19|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fat provides 9.4kcal/g of gross energy (GE) compared to protein and carbohydrate which only provide 5.56 and 4.15 kcal/g respectively.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Due to this greater energy concentration and the higher energy demand of puppies, the higher fat content of canine development diets helps reach these increased energy requirements while also providing the [[essential fatty acid]]s necessary for the growing dog. [[Omega-3 fatty acid|Omega-3]] (n-3) fatty acids are an important component of puppy diets. Multiple studies suggest brain and retinal function are dependent on the level of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids acquired during in utero development and postnatal life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bauer|first=J.E.|last2=Heinemann|first2=K.M.|last3=Lees|first3=G.E.|last4=Waldron|first4=M.K.|year=2006|title=Retinal functions of young dogs are improved and maternal plasma phospholipids are altered with diets containing long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids during gestation, lactation, and after weaning|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=136|pages=1991–1994|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heinemann|first=K.M.|last2=Bauer|first2=J.E.|year=2006|title=Docosahexaenoic acid and neurologic development in animals|url=|journal=Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association|volume=228|pages=700–705|via=|doi=10.2460/javma.228.5.700}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Docosahexaenoic acid|DHA]] is the main n-3 fatty acid and can be obtained as DHA itself from dietary sources such as fish and fish oils, or as the DHA precursor linolenic acid.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; With a high DHA intake, plasma lipid DHA content increases, aiding neurological development, as demonstrated by increases in memory and learning ability.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Other benefits of n-3 and DHA include promotion of neurogenesis, increased neuron size and phospholipid synthesis, as well as protection against cell death and peroxidative brain damage by damaging [[Radical (chemistry)|free radicals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bertrand|first=P.C.|last2=O'Kusky|first2=J.R.|last3=Innis|first3=S.M.|year=2006|title=Maternal dietary (n-3) fatty acid deficiency alters neurogenesis in the embryonic rat brain.|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=136|pages=1570–1575|via=|doi=10.1093/jn/136.6.1570}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the rodent model and presumably across the mammalian kingdom. A deficit of dietary n-3 fatty acids leads to a reduction in brain DHA content by 50-80%, leading to cognitive deficits and increased n-6 fatty acid level which increases inflammation.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Adequate intake and recommended allowance levels of 85g/kg (DM) of total fat (8.5%), and 0.5g/kg (DM) of omega 3 fatty acids (EPA+DHA) are laid out by the NRC.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Both of these values are also laid out as recommendations by AAFCO. However, according to a study on the effects of supplementing DHA in puppy diets, diets containing 1.4% n-3 fatty acids, or 0.19% DHA resulted in optimal neurological function.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Vitamin E ==
Along with DHA, [[vitamin E]] also supports the proper development of eyesight, reduces oxidative damage, and provides additional immune function support.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During instances of immune system stimulation, such as vaccinations and infection, immune cells generate more tissue damaging free radicals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These free radicals are reduced by the action of antioxidants such as vitamin E, which promote the formation and maintenance of healthy immune cells.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The adequate intake level laid out by the NRC consists of 24&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (36 IU/kg) of vitamin E, with a recommended allowance of 30&amp;nbsp;mg/kg (45 IU/kg).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, the regulatory guidance laid out by AAFCO states a vitamin E minimum recommendation of 50 IU/kg DM. Nonetheless, these values have been shown to be insufficient for immune protection; immune function is best optimized at a level of 500 IU/kg.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition to prevention of free radical damage, this higher level of vitamin E greatly increases the number of memory [[Memory T cell|CD4+ immune cells]], aiding in a greater and a longer response to infection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Due to their still-developing immune system, puppies are more susceptible to infection than adult dogs, and proper levels of vitamin E, as indicated above, are needed in their diet.

== Fibre ==
Although young growing dogs have immature gastrointestinal tracts, they do contain [[Microbiota|microflora]] which can ferment [[Dietary fiber|fibre]] and generate [[Short-chain fatty acid|short chain fatty acids]] beneficial to gut health.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=S.|last2=Fahey|first2=G.|last3=Corbin|first3=J.|last4=Pugh|first4=J.|last5=Franklin|first5=R.|year=1981|title=Evaluation of byproduct feedstuffs as dietary ingredients for dogs|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=53|pages=1538–1544|via=|doi=10.2527/jas1982.5361538x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silvio|first=J.|last2=Harmon|first2=D.L.|last3=Gross|first3=K.L.|last4=McLeod|first4=K.R.|year=2000|title=Influence of fiber fermentability on nutrient digestion in the dog|url=|journal=Nutrition|volume=16|pages=289–295|via=|doi=10.1016/s0899-9007(99)00298-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonization and establishment of these bacterial populations happens over time, beginning immediately after birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buddington|first=R.K.|year=2003|title=Postnatal changes in bacterial populations in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs|url=|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=64|pages=646–651|via=|doi=10.2460/ajvr.2003.64.646}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with the ability for fermentation, addition of fibre to the diet should be done carefully, as fibre will dilute other nutrients in the feed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delorme|first=C.B.|last2=Barrette|first2=D.|last3=Monean|first3=R.|last4=Lariviere|first4=R.|year=1985|title=The effect of dietary fibre on feed intake and growth in beagle puppies|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Comparative Medicine|volume=49|pages=278|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are different types of fibre, all are made of carbohydrates, and NRC classifies them into fermentable and non-fermentable carbohydrates.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Fermentable carbohydrates are generally 3-10 monosaccharide units joined by glycosidic bonds which cannot be degraded by endogenous enzymes and require the fermentation processes of intestinal microflora for proper degradation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Non-fermentable fibres are carbohydrate structures which are not fully fermented even by intestinal microflora. Little research has been done on non-fermentable fibre, however it is known that it causes fecal bulking and reduced intestinal transit time.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It has been shown that addition of non-fermentable fibre in concentrations of 22% or greater of the total diet will reduce growth, feed intake and feed efficiency.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Fermentable fibre is more beneficial for growing puppies, and it is often considered a prebiotic, meaning it supports the growth of beneficial microflora species in the intestinal tract.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gibson|first=G.R.|last2=Roberfroid|first2=M.B.|year=1995|title=Dietary modulation of the human colonic microbiota: Introducing the concept of prebiotics|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=125|pages=1401–1412|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermentable fibre often contains [[Fructooligosaccharide|fructo-oligosaccharides]] (FOS) and [[Mannan oligosaccharide-based nutritional supplements|mannanoligosaccharides]] (MOS), both of which greatly stimulate gut health.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swanson|first=K.S.|last2=Grieshop|first2=C.M.|last3=Flickinger|first3=E.A.|last4=Healy|first4=H.P.|last5=Dawson|first5=K.A.|last6=Merchen|first6=N.R.|last7=Fahey Jr.|first7=G.C.|year=2002|title=Effects of supplemental fructooligosaccharides plus mannanoligosaccharides on immune function and ileal and fecal microbial populations in adult dogs|url=|journal=Archives of Animal Nutrition|volume=46|pages=309–318|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; FOS are fermented by beneficial bacteria such as [[Bifidobacterium|bifidobacteria]] promoting their growth, while most pathogenic bacterial strains such as E. coli, C. perfringens and Salmonella are unable to ferment it.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; MOS has been shown to stimulate the immune system and increase resistance to pathogenic bacteria.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Beet pulp is generally the standard fermentable fibre used in canine diets, however blends of fermentable fibre sources have been shown to be as effective at promoting gut health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Middelbos|first=I.S.|last2=Fastinger|first2=N.D.|last3=Fahey|first3=G.C.|year=2007|title=Evaluation of fermentable oligosaccharides in diets fed to dogs in comparison to fiber standards|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Science|volume=85|pages=3033–3044|via=|doi=10.2527/jas.2007-0080}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although fermentable fibre is extremely beneficial, it should still be added in moderate amounts as addition of fermentable fibre to a concentration of 14.1% or greater will result in lower digestibility of the feed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Protein ==
Growing puppies require higher levels of [[protein]] than adult dogs of the same breed to promote proper growth and development.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Case|first=L.P.|last2=Czarnecki-Maudlen|first2=G.L.|year=1990|title=Protein requirements of growing pups fed practical dry-type diets containing mixed-protein sources|url=|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=51|pages=808–812|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protein should account for at least 25% of energy; however protein requirements also depend on the digestibility of the protein and age of the puppy.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; [[Amino acid]] and nitrogen requirements decrease between 10–14 weeks, indicating that different protein levels are often beneficial before and after 14 weeks of age.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before 14 weeks of age, a protein level of 250 g/kg of diet (25% of the diet) containing 4.0 kcal ME/g will result in optimal growth.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ontko|first=J.A.|last2=Wuthier|first2=R.E.|last3=Phillips|first3=P.H.|year=1957|title=The effect of increased dietary fat upon the protein requirement of the growing dog|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=62|pages=163–169|via=|doi=10.1093/jn/62.2.163}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 14 weeks of age, protein requirements decrease to 200 g/kg of diet (20% of the diet) for optimal growth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gessert|first=C.F.|last2=Phillips|first2=P.H.|year=1956|title=Protein in the nutrition of the growing dog|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=123|pages=610–625|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burns|first=R.A.|last2=Milner|first2=J.A.|year=1982|title=Threonine, tryptophan and histidine requirements of immature beagle dogs|url=|journal=Journal of Nutrition|volume=112|pages=447–452|via=|doi=10.1093/jn/112.3.447}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Delaney|first=S.J.|last2=Hill|first2=A.S.|last3=Backus|first3=R.C.|last4=Czarnecki-Maulden|first4=G.L.|last5=Rogers|first5=Q.R.|year=2001|title=Dietary crude protein concentration does not affect the leucine requirements of growing dogs|url=|journal=Journal of Animal Physiology and Animal Nutrition|volume=85|pages=88–100|via=|doi=10.1046/j.1439-0396.2001.00306.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iodine ==
To date, there is little information available about minimum requirements of dietary iodine for developing puppies. However, literature suggests that overdosage of iodine in puppies has deleterious effects on the thyroid gland.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castillo|first=V.A.|last2=Lalia|first2=J.C.|last3=Junco|first3=M.|last4=Sartorio|first4=G.|last5=Marquez|first5=A.|last6=Rodriguez|first6=M.S.|last7=Pisarev|first7=M.A.|year=2001|title=Changes in thyroid function in puppies fed a high iodine commercial diet|url=|journal=The Veterinary Journal|volume=161|issue=80-84|pages=|via=|doi=10.1053/tvjl.2000.0523}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castillo|first=V.A.|last2=Pisarev|first2=M.A.|last3=Lalia|first3=J.C.|last4=Cabrini|first4=R.L.|last5=Marquez|first5=A.G.|year=2001|title=Nutrition: commercial diet induced hypothyroidism due to high iodine.

The NRC states an adequate intake and recommended allowance of 900 μg/kg (DM) which translates into 220μg/1000 kcal.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These values have been shown in multiple studies to be the recommended maximum allowance of iodine that would result in no abnormalities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norris|first=W.|last2=Fritz|first2=T.|last3=Taylor|first3=J.A.|year=1970|title=Cycle of accommodation to restricted dietary iodine in thyroid gland of the beagle dog|url=|journal=American Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=31|pages=21–33|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Belshaw|first=B.|last2=Cooper|first2=T.|last3=Becker|first3=D.|year=1975|title=The iodine requirement and influence of iodine intake on iodine metabolism and thyroid function in the adult beagle|url=|journal=Endocrinology|volume=96|pages=1280–1291|via=|doi=10.1210/endo-96-5-1280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
Canine development diets are designed specifically to meet the energy demands and nutritional requirements for healthy growth. Proper nutrition is imperative to support development of bones, joints, muscles, and the immune system, and includes the addition of nutrients such as protein, essential fatty acids, calcium, fibre, vitamin E, and others. Ensuring optimal energy intake allows the diet to meet the high energy demands of puppies while avoiding over nutrition, over-accelerated growth, and unhealthy weight gain. Dietary fats also help to meet these high energy demands and provide the essential fatty acids necessary for brain, neuron, and retinal development and function.  Since growing puppies require greater amounts of protein than their adult counterparts, it is important to include the appropriate amounts to support healthy development. Correct levels of both fermentable and non-fermentable fibre help to support GI and immune health. During growth, young dogs are more susceptible to infection, but the addition of proper levels of vitamin E to the diet reduces free radical oxidative damage and leads to an increase in immunity. Calcium and phosphorus, in the appropriate amounts and ratio, aid in proper bone and cartilage growth and maturation. It is imperative to be aware of the levels of other minerals as well, as the over-dosage of iodine can lead to hypothyroidism, and the delay in maturation and development of bones. It is therefore important to feed a diet that meets the nutrient minimum and/or maximum requirements established by the National Research Council in order to ensure optimal growth and development of young dogs of all breeds.

== Career ==
In 1968, Turner served briefly as a correspondent in Vietnam for the Indianapolis News. He then was commissioned as a Captain in the US Army through the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] program and assigned to the intelligence services. He served in Vietnam from 1968 through 1971, primarily assigned to [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam|MACV]] on detail to the [[Embassy of the United States, Saigon|US Embassy]] as Assistant Special Projects Officer, North Vietnam/Viet Cong Affairs Division. One of his duties was interviewing senior communist defectors and POWs. In that position, he accumulated first-hand knowledge of Vietnamese communism from those he interviewed, an experience that led to his book, Vietnamese Communism: Its Origins and Development.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RclmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Robert+F.+Turner%22&amp;dq=%22Robert+F.+Turner%22|accessdate=28 November 2017|last1=Turner|first1=Robert F.|title=Vietnamese Communism: Its Origins and Development|date=1975|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=9780817964313|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of his duties was briefing US and foreign media. In his capacity as Special Projects Officer, he also authored a top secret monograph on Viet Cong assassination policy.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

When his fellowship was complete, Turner became Special Assistant and Legislative Assistant to U.S. Senator [[Robert P. Griffin]] of Michigan for five years.&lt;ref name=fed /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert F. Turner|url=https://content.law.virginia.edu/faculty/adjunct-profile/rft3m/1216438|website=University of Virginia School of Law|publisher=University of Virginia|accessdate=29 November 2017|language=en|date=22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Senator Griffin's national security advisor and was responsible for [[Foreign policy|Foreign Affairs]], [[Military|Armed Services]] and [[Intelligence]] issues.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt; While there, he helpded draft the language that created the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

in 1991, Turner co-edited and published National Security Law and Policy, now in its third edition. At the time of its creation, the field of national security law did not exist as a separate discipline in the legal profession. Turner went on to become a three-term chairman of the ABA Standing Committee on Law and National Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Links of Interest {{!}} Standing Committee|url=https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_services/law_national_security/resources/links_of_interest.html|website=www.americanbar.org|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gellman|first1=Barton|title=Washingtonpost.com: Fog of War - Post Archive|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/fogofwar/archive/post012491_2.htm|accessdate=29 November 2017|publisher=The Washington Post|date=25 January 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The STRING database contains information from numerous sources, including experimental data, computational prediction methods and public text collections.  It is freely accessible and it is regularly updated. The resource also serves to highlight functional enrichments in user-provided lists of proteins, using a number of functional classification systems such as [[Gene Ontology|GO]], [[Pfam]] and [[KEGG]]. The latest version 10.5 contains information on about 9.6 million proteins from more than 2000 organisms. STRING has been developed by a consortium of academic institutions including [[Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research|CPR]], [[EMBL]], [[University of Copenhagen|KU]], [[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics|SIB]], [[Dresden Technical University|TUD]] and [[University of Zurich|UZH]].

==Usage==
Protein–protein interaction networks are an important ingredient for the system-level understanding of cellular processes. 
Such networks can be used for filtering and assessing functional genomics data and for providing an intuitive platform for annotating structural, functional and evolutionary properties of proteins.
Exploring the predicted interaction networks can suggest new directions for future experimental research and provide cross-species predictions for efficient interaction mapping.

[[Image:STRING network image.png|thumb|300px|Protein–protein interaction network visualized by STRING. In this view, the color saturation of the edges represents the confidence score of a functional association]]

==Features==
The data is weighted and integrated and a confidence score is calculated for all protein interactions. Results of the various computational predictions can be inspected from different designated views. There are two modes of STRING: Protein-mode and [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG/ COG]-mode. Predicted interactions are propagated to proteins in other [[organisms]] for which interaction has been described by inference of [[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthology]]. A web interface is available to access the data and to give a fast overview of the proteins and their interactions. A plug-in for [[cytoscape]] to use STRING data is available.
Another possibility to access data STRING is to use the [[application programming interface]] (API) by constructing a URL that contain the request.

==Data sources==
Like many other databases that store protein association knowledge, STRING imports data from experimentally derived protein–protein interactions through literature curation.  Furthermore, STRING also store computationally predicted interactions from: (i) text mining of scientific texts, (ii) interactions computed from genomic features, and 
(iii) interactions transferred from model organisms based on orthology.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All predicted or imported interactions are benchmarked against a common reference of functional partnership as annotated by KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes).

===Imported data===
STRING imports protein association knowledge from databases of physical interaction and databases of curated biological pathway knowledge
([[mint database|MINT]], [[HPRD]], [[Biomolecular Interaction Network Database|BIND]], [[Database of Interacting Proteins|DIP]], [[BioGRID]], [[KEGG]], [[Reactome]], [[IntAct database|IntAct]], [[EcoCyc]], [[NCI-Nature Pathway Interaction Database]], [[Gene ontology|GO]]).
Links are supplied to the originating data of the respective experimental repositories and database resources.

===Text mining===
A large body of scientific texts ([[Saccharomyces Genome Database|SGD]], [[OMIM]], [[FlyBase]], [[PubMed]]) are parsed to search for statistically relevant co-occurrences of gene names.

===Predicted data===
* Neighborhood: Similar genomic context in different species suggest a similar function of the proteins.
* Fusion-fission events: Proteins that are fused in some genomes are very likely to be functionally linked (as in other genomes where the genes are not fused).
* Occurrence: Proteins that have a similar function or an occurrence in the same metabolic pathway, must be expressed together and have similar [[Phylogenetic profiling|phylogenetic profile]].
* Coexpression: Predicted association between genes based on observed patterns of simultaneous expression of genes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="891">'''Primary cremation'''  and '''secondary cremation''' are terms in [[archaeology]] for describing [[burial]]s of  [[Cremation|cremated]] bodies.

Primary cremation refers to burials where the body is burned "on the spot", in the grave. A secondary cremation is the burning of the body in one spot and then burying the remains and [[grave good]]s elsewhere. Secondary cremation may also more specifically refer to a cremation where the body is burned on a [[pyre]], after which the bones are collected from the ashes and buried elsewhere (Sprague 2005:138). A famous account of such a burial is that of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', describing the funeral of [[Patroclus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26061">'''Secretion''' is the movement of material from one point to another, e.g. secreted [[chemical substance]] from a [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[gland]]. In contrast, [[excretion]], is the removal of certain substances or waste products from a cell or organism. The classical mechanism of cell secretion is via secretory portals at the cell plasma membrane called [[porosomes]].&lt;ref name="pmid 22659300"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee JS, Jeremic A, Shin L, Cho WJ, Chen X, Jena BP | title = Neuronal porosome proteome: Molecular dynamics and architecture | journal = Journal of Proteomics | volume = 75 | issue = 13 | pages = 3952–62 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22659300 | doi = 10.1016/j.jprot.2012.05.017 | pmc = 4580231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Porosomes are permanent cup-shaped lipoprotein structure at the cell plasma membrane, where secretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse to release intra-vesicular contents from the cell.

[[Bacterial secretion system|Secretion in bacterial species]] means the transport or translocation of effector molecules for example: [[proteins]], [[enzymes]] or [[toxin]]s (such as [[cholera toxin]] in [[pathogenic bacteria]] for example ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'') from across the interior ([[cytoplasm]] or [[cytosol]]) of a bacterial cell to its exterior. Secretion is a very important mechanism in bacterial functioning and operation in their natural surrounding environment for adaptation and survival.

==In eukaryotic cells==
[[File:Porosome for wiki-2.jpg|thumb|240px|Porosome]]

===Mechanism===
[[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]], including [[human cells]], have a highly [[evolution|evolved]] process of secretion. Proteins [[Protein targeting|targeted]] for the outside are [[protein synthesis|synthesized]] by [[ribosome]]s docked to the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER). As they are synthesized, these proteins translocate into the ER [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], where they are [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]] and where molecular [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperone]]s aid [[protein folding]]. [[Misfolded proteins]] are usually identified here and retrotranslocated by [[Endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation|ER-associated degradation]] to the [[cytosol]], where they are degraded by a [[proteasome]]. The [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s containing the properly folded proteins then enter the [[Golgi apparatus]].

In the Golgi apparatus, the glycosylation of the proteins is modified and further [[posttranslational modifications]], including cleavage and functionalization, may occur. The [[proteins]] are then moved into secretory vesicles which travel along the [[cytoskeleton]] to the edge of the cell. More modification can occur in the secretory vesicles (for example [[insulin]] is cleaved from [[proinsulin]] in the secretory vesicles).

Eventually, there is [[vesicle fusion]] with the [[cell membrane]] at a structure called the [[porosome]], in a process called [[exocytosis]], dumping its contents out of the cell's environment.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson LL | title = Discovery of the 'porosome'; the universal secretory machinery in cells | journal = Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 126–31 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16563225 | doi = 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2006.tb00294.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict [[biochemical]] control is maintained over this sequence by usage of a [[pH]] gradient: the pH of the cytosol is 7.4, the ER's pH is 7.0, and the cis-golgi has a pH of 6.5. Secretory vesicles have pHs ranging between 5.0 and 6.0; some secretory vesicles evolve into [[lysosome]]s, which have a pH of 4.8.

==== Nonclassical secretion====
There are many proteins like [[FGF1]] (aFGF), [[FGF2]] (bFGF), [[interleukin-1]] (IL1) etc. which do not have a signal sequence. They do not use the classical ER-golgi pathway. These are secreted through various nonclassical pathways.

At least four nonclassical (unconventional) protein secretion pathways have been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nickel W, Seedorf M | title = Unconventional mechanisms of protein transport to the cell surface of eukaryotic cells | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 24 | pages = 287–308 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18590485 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.24.110707.175320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They include 1) direct translocation of proteins across the plasma membrane likely through membrane transporters, 2) blebbing, 3) lysosomal secretion, and 4) release via exosomes derived from multivesicular bodies. In addition, proteins can be released from cells by mechanical or physiological wounding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McNeil PL, Steinhardt RA | title = Plasma membrane disruption: repair, prevention, adaptation | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 19 | pages = 697–731 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14570587 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.19.111301.140101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and through nonlethal, transient oncotic pores in the plasma membrane induced by washing cells with serum-free media or buffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chirico WJ | title = Protein release through nonlethal oncotic pores as an alternative nonclassical secretory pathway | journal = BMC Cell Biology | volume = 12 | pages = 46 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 22008609 | pmc = 3217904 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2121-12-46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In human tissues===
Many [[human cell types]] have the ability to be secretory cells. They have a well-developed [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus]] to fulfill their function. [[Tissue (biology)|Tissues]] in humans that produce secretions include the [[gastrointestinal tract]] which secretes [[digestive enzyme]]s and [[gastric acid]], the [[lung]] which secretes [[surfactant]]s, and [[sebaceous gland]]s which secrete sebum to lubricate the skin and hair. [[Meibomian gland]]s in the eyelid secrete sebum to lubricate and protect the eye.

== In gram-negative bacteria==
{{main|Bacterial secretion system}}
Secretion is not unique to eukaryotes alone - it is present in bacteria and archaea as well. [[ATP binding cassette]] (ABC) type transporters are common to all the three domains of life. The Sec system constituting the Sec Y-E-G complex (see Type II secretion system (T2SS), below) is another conserved secretion system, homologous to the translocon in the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum and the Sec 61 translocon complex of yeast. Some secreted proteins are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by the Sec translocon, which requires the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide on the secreted protein. Others are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by the [[twin-arginine translocation pathway]] (Tat).  [[Gram-negative bacteria]] have two membranes, thus making secretion topologically more complex. There are at least six specialized secretion systems in gram-negative bacteria. Many secreted proteins are particularly important in bacterial pathogenesis.&lt;ref name= WooldridgeK&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Wooldridge |editor1-first=K |year=2009 |title=Bacterial Secreted Proteins: Secretory Mechanisms and Role in Pathogenesis |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-42-4}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type I secretion system (T1SS or TOSS)===
[[Image:T1SS.svg|200px|right]]
Type I secretion is a chaperone dependent secretion system employing the Hly and Tol gene clusters. The process begins as a leader sequence HlyA is recognized and binds HlyB on the membrane. This signal sequence is extremely specific for the ABC transporter. The HlyAB complex stimulates HlyD which begins to uncoil and reaches the outer membrane where TolC recognizes a terminal molecule or signal on HlyD. HlyD recruits TolC to the inner membrane and HlyA is excreted outside of the outer membrane via a long-tunnel protein channel.

Type I secretion system transports various molecules, from ions, drugs, to proteins of various sizes (20 – 900 kDa). The molecules secreted vary in size from the small ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' peptide colicin V, (10 kDa) to the ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'' cell adhesion protein LapA of 520 kDa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyd CD, Smith TJ, El-Kirat-Chatel S, Newell PD, Dufrêne YF, O'Toole GA | title = Structural features of the Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilm adhesin LapA required for LapG-dependent cleavage, biofilm formation, and cell surface localization | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 196 | issue = 15 | pages = 2775–88 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24837291 | pmc = 4135675 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01629-14 | url = http://jb.asm.org/content/196/15/2775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best characterized are the [[RTX toxin]]s and the lipases. Type I secretion is also involved in export of non-proteinaceous substrates like cyclic β-glucans and polysaccharides.

[[Image:T2SS.svg|200px|left]]

===Type II secretion system (T2SS)===
{{Main article|Type II secretion system}}
Proteins secreted through the type II system, or main terminal branch of the general secretory pathway, depend on the Sec or Tat system for initial transport into the [[periplasm]]. Once there, they pass through the outer membrane via a multimeric (12–14 subunits) complex of pore forming secretin proteins. In addition to the secretin protein, 10–15 other inner and outer membrane proteins compose the full secretion apparatus, many with as yet unknown function. Gram-negative [[Pilus#Type IV pili|type IV pili]] use a modified version of the type II system for their biogenesis, and in some cases certain proteins are shared between a pilus complex and type II system within a single bacterial species.

===Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)===
{{Main article|Type three secretion system}}
[[Image:T3SS.svg|200px|right]]
It is homologous to the basal body in bacterial flagella. It is like a molecular syringe through which a bacterium (e.g. certain types of ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Yersinia]]'', ''[[Vibrio]]'') can inject proteins into eukaryotic cells. The low Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in the cytosol opens the gate that regulates T3SS. One such mechanism to detect low calcium concentration has been illustrated by the lcrV (Low Calcium Response) antigen utilized by ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', which is used to detect low calcium concentrations and elicits T3SS attachment. The Hrp system in plant pathogens inject harpins and pathogen effector proteins through similar mechanisms into plants. This secretion system was first discovered in ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' and showed that toxins could be injected directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host's cells rather than simply be secreted into the extracellular medium.&lt;ref&gt;Salyers, A.

It was discovered in ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'', which uses this system to introduce the T-DNA portion of the Ti plasmid into the plant host, which in turn causes the affected area to develop into a crown gall (tumor).

==== Function ====
In short, Type IV secretion system (T4SS), is the general mechanism by which bacterial cells secrete or take up macromolecules. Their precise mechanism remains unknown. T4SS is encoded on [[Gram negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] conjugative elements in [[bacteria]].T4SS are cell envelope-spanning complexes or in other words 11–13 core proteins that form a channel through which DNA and proteins can travel from the cytoplasm of the donor cell to the cytoplasm of the recipient cell. Additionally, T4SS also secrete [[virulence]] factor proteins directly into host cells as well as taking up DNA from the medium during natural [[Transformation (bacteria)|transformation]], which shows the versatility of this macromolecular secretion apparatus.&lt;ref name="pmid12855161"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawley TD, Klimke WA, Gubbins MJ, Frost LS | title = F factor conjugation is a true type IV secretion system | journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters | volume = 224 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12855161 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-1097(03)00430-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Structure ====
As shown in the above figure, TraC, in particular consists of a three helix bundle and a loose globular appendage.&lt;ref name="pmid14673074" /&gt;

==== Interactions ====
T4SS has two effector proteins: firstly, ATS-1, which stands for Anaplasma translocated substrate 1, and secondly [[Ankyrin repeat|AnkA]], which stands for ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein A. Additionally, T4SS coupling proteins are VirD4, which bind to VirE2.&lt;ref name="pmid20670295"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rikihisa Y, Lin M, Niu H | title = Type IV secretion in the obligatory intracellular bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum | journal = Cellular Microbiology | volume = 12 | issue = 9 | pages = 1213–21 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20670295 | pmc = 3598623 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-5822.2010.01500.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type V secretion system (T5SS)===
{{See also|Trimeric autotransporter adhesin#Type V secretion system (T5SS)}}
[[Image:T5SS.svg|250px|right]]
Also called the autotransporter system,&lt;ref name=Thanassi2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thanassi DG, Stathopoulos C, Karkal A, Li H | title = Protein secretion in the absence of ATP: the autotransporter, two-partner secretion and chaperone/usher pathways of gram-negative bacteria (review) | journal = Molecular Membrane Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 63–72 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16092525 | doi = 10.1080/09687860500063290 }}&lt;/ref&gt; type V secretion involves use of the ''Sec'' system for crossing the inner membrane. Proteins which use this pathway have the capability to form a beta-barrel with their C-terminus which inserts into the outer membrane, allowing the rest of the peptide (the passenger domain) to reach the outside of the cell. Often, autotransporters are cleaved, leaving the beta-barrel domain in the outer membrane and freeing the passenger domain. Some researchers believe remnants of the autotransporters gave rise to the porins which form similar beta-barrel structures.&lt;ref name="Friesland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friesland, Brooke et al |title=Structural analysis of autotransporter components and the origin of porins |journal=Int J Mol Biochem |date=2011 |volume=29 |issue=13 |pages=92-112}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common example of an autotransporter that uses this secretion system is the [[Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins (TAA)|Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins]].&lt;ref name="pmid17482513"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerlach RG, Hensel M | title = Protein secretion systems and adhesins: the molecular armory of Gram-negative pathogens | journal = International Journal of Medical Microbiology | volume = 297 | issue = 6 | pages = 401–15 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17482513 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijmm.2007.03.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type VI secretion system (T6SS)===
{{Main article|Type VI secretion system}}

Type VI secretion systems  were originally identified in 2006 by the group of John Mekalanos at the Harvard Medical School (Boston, USA) in two bacterial pathogens, ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid16432199"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pukatzki S, Ma AT, Sturtevant D, Krastins B, Sarracino D, Nelson WC, Heidelberg JF, Mekalanos JJ | title = Identification of a conserved bacterial protein secretion system in Vibrio cholerae using the Dictyostelium host model system | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 5 | pages = 1528–33 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16432199 | pmc = 1345711 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0510322103 | bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.1528P | jstor = 30048406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16763151"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mougous JD, Cuff ME, Raunser S, Shen A, Zhou M, Gifford CA, Goodman AL, Joachimiak G, Ordoñez CL, Lory S, Walz T, Joachimiak A, Mekalanos JJ | title = A virulence locus of Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes a protein secretion apparatus | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5779 | pages = 1526–30 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16763151 | pmc = 2800167 | doi = 10.1126/science.1128393 | bibcode = 2006Sci...312.1526M }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were identified when mutations in the Hcp and VrgG genes in ''Vibrio Cholerae'' led to decreased virulence and pathogenicity. Since then, Type VI secretion systems have been found in a quarter of all proteobacterial genomes, including animal, plant, human pathogens, as well as soil, environmental or marine bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid18289922"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bingle LE, Bailey CM, Pallen MJ | title = Type VI secretion: a beginner's guide | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–8 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18289922 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2008.01.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18617888"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cascales E | title = The type VI secretion toolkit | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 735–41 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18617888 | pmc = 2515208 | doi = 10.1038/embor.2008.131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the early studies of Type VI secretion focused on its role in the pathogenesis of higher organisms, more recent studies suggested a broader physiological role in defense against simple eukaryotic predators and its role in inter-bacteria interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwarz S, Hood RD, Mougous JD | title = What is type VI secretion doing in all those bugs? | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 18 | issue = 12 | pages = 531–7 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20961764 | pmc = 2991376 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2010.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coulthurst 2013 S0923-2508"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coulthurst SJ | title = The Type VI secretion system - a widespread and versatile cell targeting system | journal = Research in Microbiology | volume = 164 | issue = 6 | pages = 640–54 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23542428 | doi = 10.1016/j.resmic.2013.03.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Type VI secretion system gene clusters contain from 15 to more than 20 genes, two of which, Hcp and VgrG, have been shown to be nearly universally secreted substrates of the system. Structural analysis of these and other proteins in this system bear a striking resemblance to the tail spike of the T4 phage, and the activity of the system is thought to functionally resemble phage infection.&lt;ref name="Silverman 2012 453-472"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silverman JM, Brunet YR, Cascales E, Mougous JD | title = Structure and regulation of the type VI secretion system | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 66 | pages = 453–72 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22746332 | pmc = 3595004 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-micro-121809-151619 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release of outer membrane vesicles===
In addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above, Gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material: the formation of [[bacterial outer membrane vesicles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuehn MJ, Kesty NC | title = Bacterial outer membrane vesicles and the host-pathogen interaction | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 19 | issue = 22 | pages = 2645–55 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16291643 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1299905 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of the outer membrane pinch off, forming nano-scale spherical structures made of a lipopolysaccharide-rich lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials, and are deployed for [[membrane vesicle trafficking]] to manipulate environment or invade at [[host-pathogen interface]].  Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, some have immunomodulatory effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells. release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions, the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McBroom AJ, Kuehn MJ | title = Release of outer membrane vesicles by Gram-negative bacteria is a novel envelope stress response | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 545–58 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17163978 | pmc = 1868505 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05522.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soft-bodied organisms''' are [[animal]]s that lack [[skeleton]]s, a group roughly corresponding to the group [[Vermes]] as proposed by [[Carl von Linné]]. All animals have muscles but, since muscles can only pull, never push, a number of animals have developed hard parts that the muscles can pull on, commonly called skeletons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last=Marieb | first=Elaine |author2=Katja Hoehn
  | title=Human Anatomy &amp; Physiology
 | publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings
 | year=2007
 | edition=7th
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such skeletons may be internal, as in [[vertebrates]], or external, like in [[arthropods]]. However, a large number of animals groups do very well without hard parts.&lt;ref name=Barns&gt;Ruppert, E.E., Fox, R.S., &amp; Barnes, R.D. (2004): Invertebrate Zoology (7 ed.). Brooks / Cole. {{ISBN|0-03-025982-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This include animals like [[earthworms]], [[jellyfish]], [[tapeworms]], [[squids]] and an enormous variety of animals from almost every part of the kingdom Animalia.

== Commonality ==
Most soft-bodied animals are small, but they do make up the majority of the animal [[biomass]]. If we were to weigh up all animals on Earth with hard parts against soft-bodied ones, estimates indicate that the biomass of soft-bodied animals would be at least twice that of animals with hard parts, quite possibly much larger.&lt;ref&gt;Greenstreet S, Robinson L, Reiss H, Craeymeersch J, Callaway R, Goffin A, Jørgensen L, Robertson M, Kröncke I, de Boois I, Jacob N,  Lancaster J, (2007): [http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Uploads/Documents/Coll1007.pdf Species composition, diversity, biomass and production of the benthic invertebrate community of the North Sea]. ''Fisheries Research Services Collaborative Report'' No '''10''' (2007): 67 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly the [[roundworms]] are extremely numerous. The nematodologist [[Nathan Cobb]] described the ubiquitous presence of nematodes on Earth as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In  short, if all the matter in the universe except the nematodes were swept away, our world would still be dimly recognizable, and if, as disembodied spirits, we could then investigate it, we should find its mountains, hills, vales, rivers, lakes, and oceans represented by a film of nematodes. The location of towns would be decipherable, since for  every massing of human beings there would be a corresponding massing of certain nematodes. Trees would still stand in ghostly rows representing our streets and highways. The location of the various plants and animals would still be decipherable, and, had we sufficient knowledge, in many cases even their species could be determined by an examination of their erstwhile nematode parasites."&lt;ref&gt;Cobb, N.A. (1914, p. 472) Nematodes and their relationships. Yearbook United States Department Agriculture, 1914, 457-490. http://naldr.nal.usda.gov/NALWeb/Agricola_Link.asp?Accession=IND43748196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Anatomy==
Not being a true [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] group, soft-bodied organism vary enormously in anatomy. [[Cnidarian]]s and [[flatworms]] have a single opening to the gut and a diffuse [[nerve system]]. The [[roundworms]], [[annelids]], [[molluscs]], the various [[lophophorata|lophoporate]] [[Phylum|phyla]] and non-vertebrate [[Chordata|chordates]] have a tubular gut open at both ends. While the majority of the soft-bodied animals typically don't have any kind of skeleton, some do, mainly in the form of stiff [[cuticula]]s (roundworms, [[tardigrada|water bears]]) or [[hydrostatic skeleton]]s (annelids).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnes|first=Edward E. Ruppert ; Robert D.|title=Invertebrate zoology|year=1991|publisher=Saunders College Publ. [u.a.]|location=Fort Worth|isbn=978-0030266683|edition=6.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While lack of a skeleton typically restricts the body size of soft-bodied animals on land, marine representatives can grow to very large sizes. The heaviest soft-bodied organisms are likely the [[giant squid]]s, with maximum weight estimated at {{convert|275|kg|lb}} for females, while arctic [[lion's mane jellyfish]] mat reach comparable sizes.&lt;ref name=OShea&gt;O'Shea, S. 2003.

Guinness Publishing. p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Siphonophore]]s may grow to considerable sizes too, though they are [[colonial organism]]s, and each single animal is small.&lt;ref name="Dunn"&gt;Dunn, Casey (2005): [http://siphonophores.org/SiphOrganization.php Siphonophores]. Retrieved 2008-JUL-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Most soft-bodied organisms are as small or smaller, even microscopic. The various organisms grouped as [[mesozoa]]ns and the curious [[Placozoa]] are typically composed of just a few hundred [[cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref name=Barns/&gt;

== Fossil record ==

[[File:Fossil record gaps - delicate and soft-bodied animals.svg|thumb|left|Examples of gaps within the fossil record of delicate and soft-bodied animals display numerous discontinuities of 150 [[Myr]] and more]]
The lack of hard parts in Soft-bodied organisms makes them extremely rare in the [[fossil record]]. Accordingly, the [[evolution]]ary history of many of the soft-bodied groups are poorly known. The first major find of fossil soft-bodied animals was from the [[Burgess Shale]] in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson, E.N.K. (1993): Invertebrate Palaeontology and Evolution, (3rd edition). Chapman &amp; Hall, {{ISBN|0-412-47990-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, several sites with [[Burgess Shale type preservation]] are known, but the history of many groups of soft-bodied animals is still poorly understood.

'''Stem cells'''     are [[cell (biology)|biological cells]] that can [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into other types of cells and can [[cell division|divide]] to produce more of the same type of stem cells. They are found in [[multicellular organisms]].

In [[mammal]]s, there are two broad types of stem cells: [[embryonic stem cell]]s, which are isolated from the [[inner cell mass]] of [[blastocyst]]s, and [[adult stem cell]]s, which are found in various [[tissue (biology)|tissues]]. In [[adult]] organisms, stem cells and [[progenitor cell]]s act as a repair system for the body, replenishing adult tissues. In a developing [[embryo]], stem cells can differentiate into all the specialized cells—ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm (see [[induced pluripotent stem cells]])—but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin, or intestinal tissues.

There are three known accessible sources of [[autologous]] adult stem cells in humans:
# [[Bone marrow]], which requires extraction by ''harvesting'', that is, drilling into bone (typically the [[femur]] or [[iliac crest]]).
# Adipose tissue (fat cells), which requires extraction by liposuction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coughlin RP, Oldweiler A, Mickelson DT, Moorman CT | title = Adipose-Derived Stem Cell Transplant Technique for Degenerative Joint Disease | journal = Arthroscopy Techniques | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = e1761-e1766 | date = October 2017 | pmid = 29399463 | pmc = 5795060 | doi = 10.1016/j.eats.2017.06.048 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Blood, which requires extraction through [[apheresis]], wherein blood is drawn from the donor (similar to a blood donation), and passed through a machine that extracts the stem cells and returns other portions of the blood to the donor.
Stem cells can also be taken from [[umbilical cord blood]] just after birth. Of all stem cell types, autologous harvesting involves the least risk. By definition, autologous cells are obtained from one's own body, just as one may bank his or her own blood for elective surgical procedures.

Adult stem cells are frequently used in various medical therapies (e.g., [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|bone marrow transplantation]]). Stem cells can now be [[Cell culture|artificially grown]] and transformed (differentiated) into specialized cell types with characteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves. Embryonic [[cell line]]s and [[autologous]] embryonic stem cells generated through [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] or [[Cellular differentiation#Dedifferentiation|dedifferentiation]] have also been proposed as promising candidates for future therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tuch BE | title = Stem cells--a clinical update | journal = Australian Family Physician | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 719–21 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16969445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into stem cells grew out of findings by [[Ernest McCulloch|Ernest A.

==Properties==
The classical definition of a stem cell requires that it possesses two properties:
* ''Self-renewal'': the ability to go through numerous [[cell cycle|cycles]] of [[cell division]] while maintaining the undifferentiated state.
* ''Potency'': the capacity to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into specialized cell types. In the strictest sense, this requires stem cells to be either [[totipotency|totipotent]] or [[pluripotency|pluripotent]]—to be able to give rise to any mature cell type, although [[multipotent]] or [[unipotent cell|unipotent]] [[progenitor cell]]s are sometimes referred to as stem cells. Apart from this it is said that stem cell function is regulated in a feed back mechanism.

===Self-renewal===
Two mechanisms exist to ensure that a stem cell population is maintained:

1. [[Asymmetric cell division|Obligatory asymmetric replication]]: a stem cell divides into one mother cell that is identical to the original stem cell, and another daughter cell that is differentiated.

When a stem cell self-renews it divides and does not disrupt the undifferentiated state. This self-renewal demands control of cell cycle as well as upkeep of multipotency or pluripotency, which all depends on the stem cell.&lt;ref&gt;Shenghui, H. E., Nakada, D., &amp; Morrison, S. J. (2009). Mechanisms of stem cell self-renewal. Annual Review of Cell and Developmental, 25, 377–406.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. Stochastic differentiation: when one stem cell develops into two differentiated daughter cells, another stem cell undergoes [[mitosis]] and produces two stem cells identical to the original.

===Potency meaning===

These stem cells can become any tissue in the body, excluding a placenta.

* [[Unipotency|Unipotent]] cells can produce only one cell type, their own,&lt;ref name=Schoeler/&gt; but have the property of self-renewal, which distinguishes them from non-stem cells (e.g. [[progenitor cell]]s, which cannot self-renew).

===Identification===
In practice, stem cells are identified by whether they can regenerate tissue. For example, the defining test for bone marrow or [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s (HSCs) is the ability to transplant the cells and save an individual without HSCs. This demonstrates that the cells can produce new blood cells over a long term. It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.

Properties of stem cells can be illustrated ''[[in vitro]]'', using methods such as [[clonogenic assay]]s, in which single cells are assessed for their ability to differentiate and self-renew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Friedenstein AJ, Deriglasova UF, Kulagina NN, Panasuk AF, Rudakowa SF, Luriá EA, Ruadkow IA | title = Precursors for fibroblasts in different populations of hematopoietic cells as detected by the in vitro colony assay method | journal = Experimental Hematology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 83–92 | year = 1974 | pmid = 4455512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

However, ''in vitro'' culture conditions can alter the behavior of cells, making it unclear whether the cells shall behave in a similar manner ''[[in vivo]]''. There is considerable debate as to whether some proposed adult cell populations are truly stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2006-09-01|title=Stem Cell Therapy|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0976001611602093|journal=Apollo Medicine|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=271–276|doi=10.1016/S0976-0016(11)60209-3|issn=0976-0016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embryonic==
{{Main|Embryonic stem cell}}

[[Embryonic stem cell]]s (ESCs) are the cells of the [[inner cell mass]] of a [[blastocyst]], an early-stage [[embryo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomson JA, Itskovitz-Eldor J, Shapiro SS, Waknitz MA, Swiergiel JJ, Marshall VS, Jones JM | title = Embryonic stem cell lines derived from human blastocysts | journal = Science | volume = 282 | issue = 5391 | pages = 1145–7 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9804556 | doi = 10.1126/science.282.5391.1145 | bibcode = 1998Sci...282.1145T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human [[embryo]]s reach the [[blastocyst]] stage 4–5 days post [[Human fertilization|fertilization]], at which time they consist of 50–150 cells. ESCs are [[pluripotent]] and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three primary [[germ layer]]s: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult [[human body|body]] when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extra-embryonic membranes or the [[placenta]].

During embryonic development these inner cell mass cells continuously divide and become more specialized.  For example, a portion of the ectoderm in the dorsal part of the embryo specializes as '[[neurectoderm]]', which will become the future [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name="Developmental biology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Scott F.|last2=College|first2=Swarthmore| name-list-format = vanc  |title=Developmental biology|date=2014|publisher=Sinauer|location=Sunderland, Mass.|isbn=978-0878939787|edition=Tenth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in development, [[neurulation]] causes the neurectoderm to form the [[neural tube]].  At the neural tube stage, the anterior portion undergoes [[encephalization]] to generate or 'pattern' the basic form of the brain.  At this stage of development, the principal cell type of the CNS is considered a [[neural stem cell]].  These neural stem cells are pluripotent, as they can generate a large diversity of many different neuron types, each with unique gene expression, morphological, and functional characteristics.  The process of generating neurons from stem cells is called [[neurogenesis]].  One prominent example of a neural stem cell is the [[radial glial cell]], so named because it has a distinctive bipolar morphology with highly elongated processes spanning the thickness of the neural tube wall, and because historically it shared some [[glial]] characteristics, most notably the expression of [[glial fibrillary acidic protein]] (GFAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rakic P | title = Evolution of the neocortex: a perspective from developmental biology | journal = Nature Reviews.

Neural stem cells are committed to the neuronal lineages ([[neuron]]s, [[astrocyte]]s, and [[oligodendrocyte]]s), and thus their potency is restricted.&lt;ref name="Developmental biology"/&gt;

Nearly all research to date has made use of mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) or human embryonic stem cells (hES) derived from the early inner cell mass.  Both have the essential stem cell characteristics, yet they require very different environments in order to maintain an undifferentiated state. Mouse ES cells are grown on a layer of [[gelatin]] as an [[extracellular matrix]] (for support) and require the presence of [[leukemia inhibitory factor]] (LIF) in serum media. A drug cocktail containing inhibitors to [[GSK3B]] and the [[MAPK/ERK pathway]], called 2i, has also been shown to maintain pluripotency in stem cell culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ying QL, Wray J, Nichols J, Batlle-Morera L, Doble B, Woodgett J, Cohen P, Smith A | title = The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal | journal = Nature | volume = 453 | issue = 7194 | pages = 519–23 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18497825 | pmc = 5328678 | doi = 10.1038/nature06968 | bibcode = 2008Natur.453..519Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human ESCs are grown on a feeder layer of mouse embryonic [[fibroblasts]] and require the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF-2).&lt;ref&gt;

A human embryonic stem cell is also defined by the expression of several transcription factors and cell surface proteins. The transcription factors [[Oct-4]], [[Homeobox protein NANOG|Nanog]], and [[Sox2]] form the core regulatory network that ensures the suppression of genes that lead to differentiation and the maintenance of pluripotency.&lt;ref&gt;

By using human embryonic stem cells to produce specialized cells like nerve cells or heart cells in the lab, scientists can gain access to adult human cells without taking tissue from patients. They can then study these specialized adult cells in detail to try and catch complications of diseases, or to study cells reactions to potentially new drugs.  The molecular definition of a stem cell includes many more proteins and continues to be a topic of research.&lt;ref&gt;

The use of adult stem cells in research and therapy is not as [[Stem cell controversy|controversial]] as the use of [[embryonic stem cell]]s, because the production of adult stem cells does not require the destruction of an [[embryo]]. Additionally, in instances where adult stem cells are obtained from the intended recipient (an [[autograft]]), the risk of rejection is essentially non-existent. Consequently, more US government funding is being provided for adult stem cell research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2004pres/20040714b.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109104735/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2004pres/20040714b.html |archive-date=2009-01-09 |publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services |title=Stem Cell FAQ |date=2004-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amniotic==
Multipotent stem cells are also found in [[amniotic fluid]]. These stem cells are very active, expand extensively without feeders and are not tumorigenic. [[Amniotic stem cells]] are multipotent and can differentiate in cells of adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, endothelial, hepatic and also neuronal lines.&lt;ref&gt;

Amniotic stem cells are a topic of active research.

Use of stem cells from [[amniotic fluid]] overcomes the ethical objections to using human embryos as a source of cells.

==Induced pluripotent==
{{Main|Induced pluripotent stem cell}}

Adult stem cells have limitations with their potency; unlike [[embryonic stem cell]]s (ESCs), they are not able to differentiate into cells from all three [[germ layers]]. As such, they are deemed [[cell potency|multipotent]].

However, [[reprogramming]] allows for the creation of pluripotent cells, [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (iPSCs), from adult cells. These are not adult stem cells, but adult cells (e.g. epithelial cells) reprogrammed to give rise to cells with pluripotent capabilities. Using genetic reprogramming with protein [[transcription factors]], pluripotent stem cells with ESC-like capabilities have been derived.&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"&gt;{{cite news|title=Making human embryonic stem cells|publisher=The Economist|url=http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10170972|date=2007-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16466265|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|title=Skin Cells Can Become Embryonic Stem Cells|author1=Brand, Madeleine |author2=Palca, Joe |author3=Cohen, Alex |date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/science/july-dec07/stemcells_11-20.html|title=Breakthrough Set to Radically Change Stem Cell Debate|publisher=[[News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]|date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first demonstration of induced pluripotent stem cells was conducted by [[Shinya Yamanaka]] and his colleagues at [[Kyoto University]].&lt;ref name = "overview"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimbrel EA, Lanza R | title = Pluripotent stem cells: the last 10 years | journal = Regenerative Medicine | volume = 11 | issue = 8 | pages = 831–847 | date = December 2016 | pmid = 27908220 | doi = 10.2217/rme-2016-0117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They used the transcription factors [[Oct-4|Oct3/4]], [[Sox2]], [[c-Myc]], and [[Klf4]] to reprogram mouse fibroblast cells into pluripotent cells.&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "og Yak"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic and adult fibroblast cultures by defined factors | journal = Cell | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 663–76 | date = August 2006 | pmid = 16904174 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.07.024 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent work used these factors to induce pluripotency in human fibroblast cells.&lt;ref name= "2007 Yak"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi K, Tanabe K, Ohnuki M, Narita M, Ichisaka T, Tomoda K, Yamanaka S | title = Induction of pluripotent stem cells from adult human fibroblasts by defined factors | journal = Cell | volume = 131 | issue = 5 | pages = 861–72 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18035408 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.11.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Junying Yu]], [[James Thomson (cell biologist)|James Thomson]], and their colleagues at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] used a different set of factors, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Lin28, and carried out their experiments using cells from human [[foreskin]].&lt;ref name="Economist2007_11_22"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "wisconsin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu J, Vodyanik MA, Smuga-Otto K, Antosiewicz-Bourget J, Frane JL, Tian S, Nie J, Jonsdottir GA, Ruotti V, Stewart R, Slukvin II, Thomson JA | title = Induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from human somatic cells | journal = Science | volume = 318 | issue = 5858 | pages = 1917–20 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18029452 | doi = 10.1126/science.1151526 | bibcode = 2007Sci...318.1917Y }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were able to replicate [[Yamanaka]]'s finding that inducing pluripotency in human cells was possible.

Induced pluripotent stem cells differ from embryonic stem cells. They share many similar properties, such as [[pluripotency]] and differentiation potential, the expression of [[pluripotency]] genes, [[epigenetic]] patterns, [[embryoid body]] and [[teratoma]] formation, and viable [[chimera (genetics)|chimera]] formation,&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "og Yak" /&gt; but there are many differences within these properties. The chromatin of iPSCs appears to be more "closed" or methylated than that of ESCs.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "og Yak" /&gt; Similarly, the gene expression pattern between ESCs and iPSCs, or even iPSCs sourced from different origins.&lt;ref name="overview" /&gt; There are thus questions about the "completeness" of [[reprogramming]] and the somatic memory of induced pluripotent stem cells. Despite this, inducing [[adult cell]]s to be pluripotent appears to be viable.

As a result of the success of these experiments, [[Ian Wilmut]], who helped create the first cloned animal [[Dolly the Sheep]], has announced that he will abandon [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] as an avenue of research.&lt;ref&gt;"His inspiration comes from the research by Prof [[Shinya Yamanaka]] at [[Kyoto University]], which suggests a way to create human embryo stem cells without the need for human eggs, which are in extremely short supply, and without the need to create and destroy human cloned embryos, which is bitterly opposed by the pro life movement."{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3314696/Dolly-creator-Prof-Ian-Wilmut-shuns-cloning.html|title=Dolly creator Prof Ian Wilmut shuns cloning|author=Highfield, Roger |date=2007-11-16|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, induced pluripotent stem cells provide several therapeutic advantages. Like ESCs, they are [[pluripotent]]. They thus have great differentiation potential; theoretically, they could produce any cell within the human body (if [[reprogramming]] to pluripotency was "complete").&lt;ref name = "overview" /&gt; Moreover, unlike ESCs, they potentially could allow doctors to create a pluripotent stem cell line for each individual patient.&lt;ref name="R&amp;D"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Robinton DA, Daley GQ | title = The promise of induced pluripotent stem cells in research and therapy | journal = Nature | volume = 481 | issue = 7381 | pages = 295–305 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22258608 | pmc = 3652331 | doi = 10.1038/nature10761 | bibcode = 2012Natur.481..295R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frozen blood samples can be used as a valuable source of induced pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100703175036/http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/tre6604si-us-stemcells-frozen/ Frozen blood a source of stem cells, study finds]. newsdaily.com (2010-07-01)&lt;/ref&gt; Patient specific stem cells allow for the screening for side effects before drug treatment, as well as the reduced risk of transplantation rejection.&lt;ref name= "R&amp;D" /&gt; Despite their current limited use therapeutically, iPSCs hold create potential for future use in medical treatment and research.

==Lineage==
{{Main|Stem cell line}}
To ensure self-renewal, stem cells undergo two types of cell division (see ''Stem cell division and differentiation'' diagram). Symmetric division gives rise to two identical daughter cells both endowed with stem cell properties. Asymmetric division, on the other hand, produces only one stem cell and a [[progenitor cell]] with limited self-renewal potential. Progenitors can go through several rounds of cell division before terminally [[cell differentiation|differentiating]] into a mature cell. It is possible that the molecular distinction between symmetric and asymmetric divisions lies in differential segregation of cell membrane proteins (such as [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]]) between the daughter cells.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Beckmann J, Scheitza S, Wernet P, Fischer JC, Giebel B | title = Asymmetric cell division within the human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartment: identification of asymmetrically segregating proteins | journal = Blood | volume = 109 | issue = 12 | pages = 5494–501 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17332245 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2006-11-055921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative theory is that stem cells remain undifferentiated due to environmental cues in their particular niche. Stem cells differentiate when they leave that niche or no longer receive those signals. Studies in ''Drosophila'' germarium have identified the signals [[decapentaplegic]] and adherens junctions that prevent germarium stem cells from differentiating.&lt;ref&gt;

==Treatments==
{{Main|Stem cell therapy}}

Stem cell therapy is the use of stem cells to treat or prevent a disease or condition.  [[Bone marrow transplant]] is a form of stem cell therapy that has been used for many years without controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Murnaghan for Explore Stem Cells. Updated: 16 December 2013  [http://www.explorestemcells.co.uk/WhyPerformStemCellTransplant.html Why Perform a Stem Cell Transplant?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCI&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Therapy/bone-marrow-transplant Bone Marrow Transplantation and Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation] In National Cancer Institute Fact Sheet web site.

=== Advantages ===
Stem cell treatments may lower symptoms of the disease or condition that is being treated. The lowering of symptoms may allow patients to reduce the drug intake of the disease or condition. Stem cell treatment may also provide knowledge for society to further stem cell understanding and future treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Master |first=Zubin |last2=McLeod |first2=Marcus |last3=Mendez |first3=Ivar | name-list-format = vanc |date=2007 |title=Benefits, Risks and Ethical Considerations in Translation of Stem Cell Research to Clinical Applications in Parkinson's Disease |jstor=27719821 |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=169–73 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
Stem cell treatments may require [[immunosuppression]] because of a requirement for radiation before the transplant to remove the person's previous cells, or because the patient's immune system may target the stem cells. One approach to avoid the second possibility is to use stem cells from the same patient who is being treated.

Pluripotency in certain stem cells could also make it difficult to obtain a specific cell type. It is also difficult to obtain the exact cell type needed, because not all cells in a population differentiate uniformly. Undifferentiated cells can create tissues other than desired types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Moore KL, Persaud TV, Torchia MG | title = Before We Are Born: Essentials of Embryology and Birth Defects. | location = Philadelphia, PA | publisher = Saunders, Elsevier | date = 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years, with the ability of scientists to isolate and culture [[embryonic stem cells]], and with scientists' growing ability to create stem cells using [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] and techniques to create [[induced pluripotent stem cells]], controversy has crept in, both related to [[abortion debate|abortion politics]] and to [[human cloning]].

The field reflects a desire to give the generalities and broad-based approach of “[[sustainability]]” a stronger analytic and scientific underpinning as it "brings together scholarship and practice, global and local perspectives from north and south, and disciplines across the natural and social sciences, engineering, and medicine".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.C., &amp; Dickson, N. M. 2003. Sustainability science: The emerging research program. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA'' 100(14): 8059-8061.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologist [[William C. Clark]] proposes that it can be usefully thought of as "neither 'basic' nor 'applied' research but as a field defined by the problems it addresses rather than by the disciplines it employs" and that it "serves the need for advancing both knowledge and action by creating a dynamic bridge between the two".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, W.C. 2007. "Sustainability Science: A room of its own". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of  Science'' 104: 1737-1738; published online on February 6, 2007, 10.1073/pnas.0611291104&lt;/ref&gt;

The field is focused on examining the interactions between human, environmental, and engineered systems to understand and contribute to solutions for complex challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the integrity of the life support systems of the planet, such as climate change, [[biodiversity loss]], pollution and land and water degradation.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.earthsystemgovernance.net/conceptual-foundations/?page_id=73 Sustainability Science]". ''Task Force on Conceptual Foundations''. [[Earth System Governance Project]]. earthsystemgovernance.net. Retrieved 2017-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainability science, like [[sustainability]] itself, derives some impetus from the concepts of [[sustainable development]] and [[environmental science]].&lt;ref name="ensci.iastate.edu"&gt;[http://www.ensci.iastate.edu Environmental Science: Iowa State University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainability science provides a critical framework for sustainability&lt;ref&gt;Komiyama, H., Takeuchi, K. 2006. Sustainability science: building a new discipline. Sustainability Science 1:1–6.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[sustainability measurement]] provides the evidence-based quantitative data needed to guide [[sustainability governance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |title=Sustainability Accounting in UK Local Government |publisher=The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants |accessdate=2008-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411231334/http://www.accaglobal.com/publicinterest/activities/research/reports/sustainable_and_transparent/rr-078 |archivedate=2008-04-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Consensual definition of sustainability science is as elusive as the definition of "sustainability" or "sustainable development". In an overview presented on its website in 2008 the Sustainability Science Program at [[Harvard University]] described the field in the following way, stressing its [[interdisciplinarity]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;'Sustainability science' is problem-driven, interdisciplinary scholarship that seeks to facilitate the design, implementation, and evaluation of effective interventions that foster shared prosperity and reduced poverty while protecting the environment. It is defined by the problems it addresses rather than the disciplines it employs. It thus draws as needed from multiple disciplines of the natural, social, medical and engineering sciences, from the professions, and from the knowledge of practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cid.harvard.edu./sustsci/overview.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119091925/http://www.cid.harvard.edu./sustsci/overview.html|archive-date=November 19, 2008 |title=Overview |work=Sustainable Science Program |publisher=Harvard University |access-date=2017-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Susan Kieffer|Susan W. Kieffer]] and colleagues, in 2003, suggested, more specifically, that sustainability science is: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the cultivation, integration, and application of knowledge about Earth systems gained especially from the holistic and historical sciences (such as geology, ecology, climatology, oceanography) coordinated with knowledge about human interrelationships gained from the social sciences and humanities, in order to evaluate, mitigate, and minimize the consequences, regionally and worldwide, of human impacts on planetary systems and on societies across the globe and into the future&amp;nbsp;– that is, in order that humans can be knowledgeable Earth stewards.&lt;ref&gt;Kieffer, S.W., Barton, P., Palmer, A.R., Reitan, P.H., &amp; Zen, E. 2003. "Megascale events: Natural disasters and human behavior". Geological Society of America Abstracts with programs: 432.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been noted that the new paradigm &lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;must encompass different magnitudes of scales (of time, space, and function), multiple balances (dynamics), multiple actors (interests) and multiple failures (systemic faults).&lt;ref&gt;Reitan, P. 2005. Sustainability science – and what’s needed beyond science. Sustainability: Science, Practice, &amp; Policy 1(1):77-80. [http://ejournal.nbii.org/archives /vol1iss1/communityessay.reitan.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070124163750/http://ejournal.nbii.org/archives/ |date=2007-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Others take a much broader view of sustainability science, emphasizing the need to analyze the root causes of the fundamental unsustainability of the prevailing economic system, such as the emphasis on growth as key to solving political and social problems and advancing society's well-being. In a 2012 article entitled "Sustainability Science Needs to Include Sustainable Consumption," published in Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development, Halina Brown argues that sustainability science must include the study of the sociology of material consumption and the structure of consumerist society, the role of technology in aggravating the unsustainable social practices, as well as in solving the problems they create, the macroeconomic theories that presuppose economic growth as a necessary condition for advancing societal well-being, and others.&lt;ref name="Brown 2012 20–25"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Halina Szejnwald|title=Sustainability Science Needs to Include Sustainable Consumption|journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development|date=24 January 2012|volume=54|issue=1|pages=20–25|doi=10.1080/00139157.2012.639598|url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/2012/January-February%202012/science-needs_Full.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broad objectives==
The case for making research and development an important component of sustainable development strategies was embraced by many international scientific organizations in the mid-1980s, promoted by the Brundtland Commission's report ''[[Our Common Future]]'' in 1987, and noted in the ''[[Agenda 21]]'' plan that emerged from the ''[[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]]'' in 1992 and further developed at the ''[[World Summit on Sustainable Development]]'', held in Johannesburg in 2002.

The topics of the following sub-headings indicate recurring themes that are addressed in the literature of sustainability science.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffmann, Joanne 2009. Advancing sustainability science: report on the International Conference on Sustainability Science (ICSS) 2009. ''Sustainability Science'' '''4''': 233-242.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 a compendium of basic papers in this new discipline was published as ''Readings in Sustainability Science and Technology'', edited by [[Robert Kates]], with a preface by William Clark.&lt;ref name="hks.harvard.edu"&gt;Kates, Robert W., ed. (2010). ''Readings in Sustainability Science and Technology''. CID Working Paper No. 213. Center for International Development, Harvard University. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University, December 2010. [https://www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid/publications/faculty-working-papers/cid-working-paper-no.-213 Abstract] and [https://www.hks.harvard.edu/content/download/69257/1249838/version/1/.../213.pdf PDF file] available on the Harvard Kennedy School website; retrieved 2017-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 Commentary by Halina Brown extensively expands the scope of that seminal publication.&lt;ref name="Brown 2012 20–25"/&gt; This is work in progress. The 2012 Encyclopedia of Sustainability Science and Technology was created as a collaboration of over 1000 scientists to provide peer-reviewed entries covering sustainability research and policy evaluations of technology.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, R. (2012). Encyclopedia of sustainability science and technology. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge structuring of issues===
Knowledge structuring has been identified as an essential first step in the effort to acquire a comprehensive view of sustainability issues which are both complex and interconnected. This is needed as a response to the requirements of academia, industry and government.

===Coordination of data===
The key research and data for sustainability are sourced from many scientific disciplines, topics and organisations. A major part of knowledge structuring will entail building up the tools that provide an “overview” of what is known. Sustainability science can construct and coordinate a framework within which the vast amount of data can be easily accessed.

===Interdisciplinary approaches===
The attempt, by sustainability science, to understand the integrated “whole” of planetary and human systems requires cooperation between scientific, social and economic disciplines, public and private sectors, academia and government. In short it requires a massive global cooperative effort and one major task of sustainability science is to assist integrated cross-disciplinary coordination.

The '''University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies''' ('''UTIAS''', {{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|t|aɪ|ə|s}} {{respell|yoo|TY|əs}}) is an advanced research facility for [[aeronautics]] and [[aerospace engineering]], located in the [[Downsview]] district of [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada. Established in 1949 by founding Director Gordon N. Patterson, the institute is managed by the [[University of Toronto Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering]] and mainly receives funding from governmental agencies such as the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]], the [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] and the [[Canadian space agency|Canadian Space Agency]]. Notable international sponsors include the [[European Space Agency]], [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], [[Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik]], [[NASA Ames Research Center]] and the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]].

==History==

In 1970, the institute was involved in the emergency rescue of the [[Apollo 13]] astronauts, after the mission was aborted by a major accident en route to the Moon. UTIAS was contacted for assistance due to its expertise in shockwaves and aerospace dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utias.utoronto.ca/AssetFactory.aspx?did=220 |title=An Account of UTIAS Involvement in the Rescue of Apollo 13 |last=Sullivan |first=Phil |publisher=University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engineers and scientists at UTIAS calculated the amount of pressure needed to separate the [[Lunar Module]] from the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] without damaging the hatch, allowing the crew to survive the re-entry to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casmuseum.org/common/PDF/pressreleases/CASM_Apollo_13_Release_2010.pdf |title=Canadians celebrate Canada's contribution to the safe return of the Apollo 13 astronauts on 40th anniversary of original space mission |publisher=[[Canadian Air and Space Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Observing the 40th anniversary of the incident in 2010, lunar module pilot [[Fred Haise]] wrote a letter thanking the UTIAS team for its contribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aiac.ca/success-stories/utias-bringing-apollo-13-home.aspx |title=UTIAS - Bringing Apollo 13 Home |publisher=Aerospace Industries Association of Canada |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523072844/http://www.aiac.ca/success-stories/utias-bringing-apollo-13-home.aspx |archivedate=2010-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years,{{when|date=October 2013}} the institute has produced the world's first [[microwave]]-powered aircraft, the world's first engine-powered [[ornithopter]] (both inventions of [[James DeLaurier]]), and Canada's first [[space telescope]], [[Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope|MOST]].  The major expertise areas represented are [[aerospace engineering|aircraft design]], particularly at [[subsonic flight|subsonic]] speeds, [[flight simulation]], space [[mechatronics]] and [[robotics]], [[Microsatellite (spaceflight)|microsatellite]] technology, [[computational fluid dynamics]] and [[nuclear fusion]]. The institute's partners in the aerospace industry include [[Bombardier Aerospace]], [[MD Robotics]] (formerly [[Spar Aerospace]]) and [[General Atomics]]. It operates the [[Canadian Advanced Nanospace eXperiment Program]] for the study and testing of nanosatellite technology.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}
