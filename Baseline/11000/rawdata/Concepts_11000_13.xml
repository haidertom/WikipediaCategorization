      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5725">'''9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering''' was a series of performances from October 13–23, 1966, where artists and engineers from [[Bell Laboratories]] in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]] collaborated on what was to be the first event in a series of projects that would become known as [[E.A.T.]] or [[E.A.T.|Experiments in Art and Technology]]. 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering was conjured up by [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Billy Klüver]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://coe.berkeley.edu/labnotes/0204/history.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and was originally intended to be presented as part of the [[Stockholm]] Festival of Art and Technology in 1966. But when the festival's negotiations fell through, [[Billy Klüver]] and the whole group moved the event to the [[69th Regiment Armory]] and called it ''9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering.''&lt;ref name = "getty"&gt;[http://archives2.getty.edu:8082/xtf/view?docId=ead/940003/940003.xml;chunk.id=ref15;brand=default]&lt;/ref&gt; The participants consisted of 10 artists and some 30 engineers to create a blend of avant-garde theatre, dance and new technologies.

9 Evenings was the first large-scale collaboration between artists and engineers and scientists. The two groups worked together for 10 months to develop technical equipment and systems that were used as an integral part of the artists’ performances. Their collaboration produced many "firsts" in the use of new technology for the theater, both with specially-designed systems and equipment and with innovative use of existing equipment. [[Closed-circuit television]] and [[television]] projection was used on stage for the first time; a [[fiber-optics]] camera picked up objects in a performer's pocket; an [[infrared]] [[television camera]] captured action in total darkness; a [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] sonar device translated movement into sound; and portable wireless FM transmitters and amplifiers transmitted speech and body sounds to Armory loudspeakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.9evenings.org/ 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305133753/http://www.9evenings.org/ |date=2012-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists involved with 9 Evenings include: [[John Cage]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Öyvind Fahlström]], [[Alex Hay (artist)|Alex Hay]], [[Deborah Hay]], [[Steve Paxton]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[David Tudor]], and [[Robert Whitman]].&lt;ref name = "getty" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=294]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20th century a number of peace walks were organized involving the citizens of the United States and the [[USSR]].  These peace walks, or peace marches, represented [[citizen diplomacy]] initiatives promoting peace and [[Nuclear disarmament]] through direct person-to-person interaction among the citizens of the two [[Cold War]] opponent states.

==1960–1961 San Francisco to Moscow Walk==

A [[peace walk]] from San Francisco, US, to Moscow, USSR, took place from December 1960 to October 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Papers of the European Organiser of the American-European Peace March from San Francisco to Moscow|url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/features/peacemarch.html|publisher=The Archives Hub|accessdate=4 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929001617/http://archiveshub.ac.uk/features/peacemarch.html|archive-date=2011-09-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The walk was organized by [[Committee for NonViolent Action|Committee for Nonviolent Action]] and promoted nonviolence and unilateral nuclear disarmament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee for Non-Violent Action|url=http://www.dkosopedia.com/wiki/Committee_for_Non-Violent_Action|publisher=dKosopedia|accessdate=4 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206103631/http://dkosopedia.com/wiki/Committee_for_Non-Violent_Action|archive-date=2010-02-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee for Nonviolent Action Records, 1958–1968 (DG 017)|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/Library/peace/DG001-025/dg017/dg017cnvamain.htm|work=Swarthmore College Peace Collection|publisher=Swarthmore College|accessdate=2 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110414032457/http://www.swarthmore.edu/Library/peace/DG001-025/dg017/dg017cnvamain.htm| archivedate= 14 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anne Henrietta Martin''' (September 30, 1875 in [[Reno, Nevada|Empire City, Reno, Nevada]] &amp;ndash; April 15, 1951 in [[Carmel, California]]) (pseudonym, '''Anne O'Hara'''; nickname, '''Little Governor Anne''') was a [[suffragist]], [[Pacifism|pacifist]], and author from the state of [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="Valkenburgh"/&gt; Her main achievement was taking charge of the state legislation that gave women of Nevada the right to vote.  She was the first head of the department of history of the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] (1897-1901) And was active in the suffrage movement in England in 1909-1911, working with [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]. She was president of the Nevada equal franchise society in 1912, and the first national chairman of the [[National Woman's Party]] in 1916. She was the first  woman to run for the [[United States Senate]]; She lost twice, in 1918 and 1920.&lt;ref name="Capace2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Capace|first=Nancy|title=Encyclopedia of Nevada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oLd4nCEMbpUC&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=17 May 2012|year=2001|publisher=North American Book Dist LLC|isbn=978-0-403-09611-4|pages=126–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Kathryn.

==Early years==
Martin was the daughter of [[William O'Hara Martin]], of Irish descent, who served as a [[Nevada Senate|Nevada State Senator]],&lt;ref name="Valkenburgh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unr.edu/nwhp/bios/women/martin.htm|title=Anne Henrietta Martin|last=Van Valkenburgh|first=Holly |publisher=University of Nevada, Reno|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her mother, Louise Stadtmuller Martin, was Bavarian. She attended [[Bishop Whitaker's School for Girls]] in Reno. Anne attended the University of Nevada (1891-1894), where she earned a degree in History. She earned a second B.A. in 1896 and an M.A. in History in 1897 from [[Stanford University]].

==Career==
In 1897, Martin established the University of Nevada's department of history. After two years in the department, she left to study at [[Columbia University]], [[Parsons The New School for Design|Chase's Art School]], [[University of London]], and [[University of Leipzig]]; but returned to the department in 1901–1903.&lt;ref name="Capace2001" /&gt; During her leave from the university, Martin recommended the Board of Regents replace her with [[Jeanne Wier]], a friend of hers from Stanford who was just finishing her degree.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, Su Kim. (2015). "We Seek to Be Patient": Jeanne Wier and the Nevada Historical Society, 1904–1950. UCLA: Information Studies 045A. Retrieved from: http://escholarship.org/uc/item/51d75576 p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin returned from Europe in 1901 to attend her father's funeral. Her father's death gave her a revelation, "suddenly made a feminist of me! . . . I found that I stood alone in my family against a man-controlled world." Martin traveled in Europe and Asia and experienced the women's revolution in England between 1909 and 1911, she became a [[Fabian Socialist]], and wrote short stories and political articles, occasionally under the pen name of Anne O'Hara. Martin was arrested in 1910 over an issue of trying to enfranchise British women. Her friend from Stanford, [[Lou Henry Hoover]], sent husband, [[Herbert Hoover]], to pay Martin's bail, but [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence]] had already taken care of that.[1]

After returning to Nevada in the fall of 1911, she became president of the Nevada [[Equal Franchise Society]] in February 1912 and organized a campaign over sparsely populated deserts that convinced male voters to enfranchise women on November 3, 1914. This success led to her representation of the national movement as a speaker and executive committee member of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] and the [[Congressional Union]]. Martin helped organize voting women in the West in 1916 to challenge Democrats. She was one of the [[Silent Sentinels]], [[National Woman's Party]] women who picketed for suffrage in front of the White House on July 14, 1917; as a result, she was sentenced to [[Occoquan Workhouse]], but was pardoned less than a week later by President [[Woodrow Wilson]].

In 1918, representing Nevada, Martin was the first American woman to run for the US Senate.[2][3] Martin's campaigns focused on illuminating how women could act as a positive influence in the political world. Her platforms focused on providing better working conditions for men and women and nationalization of railroads and public utilities alienated women suffragists.
Between her 1918 and 1920 campaigns Martin wrote a series of articles and essays and in these essays Martin urges women to form autonomous political organizations.

Martin moved to Carmel, California in 1921, and recuperated from a heart attack in 1930.[1] In the 1940s, she received an honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Nevada (1945); and wrote two articles for the Encyclopædia Britannica (Josephine Butler, 1944 edition; and White Slavery, 1948 edition). Martin died in Carmel in 1951.

The '''binding problem''' is a term used at the interface between [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive science]] and [[philosophy of mind]] that has multiple meanings.

Firstly, there is the '''segregation problem''': a practical computational problem of how brains segregate elements in complex patterns of [[sensory perception|sensory input]] so that they are allocated to discrete "objects". In other words, when looking at a blue square and a yellow circle, what neural mechanisms ensure that the square is perceived as blue and the circle as yellow, and not vice versa? The segregation problem is sometimes called BP1.

Secondly, there is the '''combination problem''':The problem of how objects, background and abstract or emotional features are combined into a single experience.&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Revonsuo | first1 = A. | last2 = Newman | first2 = J. | title = Binding and consciousness. | journal = Conscious Cogn | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–7 |date=Jun 1999 | doi = 10.1006/ccog.1999.0393 | PMID = 10447994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination problem is sometimes called BP2.

However, the difference between these two problems is not always clear. Moreover, the historical literature is often ambiguous as to whether it is addressing the segregation or the combination problem.&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smythies 1994"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Smythies | first1 = John R. (John Raymond) | title = The walls of Plato's cave : the science and philosophy of (brain, consciousness, and perception | year = 1994 | publisher = Avebury | location = Aldershot ; Brookfield, USA | isbn = 978-1-85628-882-8 | oclc = 30156912 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The segregation problem==

===Definition===
The segregation problem is the problem of how brains segregate elements in complex patterns of sensory input so that they are allocated to discrete "objects".&lt;ref name="Smythies 1994"/&gt;

Smythies defined BP1 in these terms: "How is the representation of information built up in the [[neural network]]s that there is one single object 'out there' and not a mere collection of separate shapes, colours and movements?"&lt;ref name="Smythies 1994"/&gt; Revonsuo refers to this as the problem of "stimulus-related binding" – of sorting stimuli. Although usually referred to as a problem of binding, the computational problem is arguably one of discrimination.&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"/&gt; Thus, in the words of Canales et al.: "to bind together all the features of one object and segregate them from features of other objects and the background".&lt;ref name="Canales 2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Canales | first1 = AF. | last2 = Gómez | first2 = DM. | last3 = Maffet | first3 = CR. | title = A critical assessment of the consciousness by synchrony hypothesis. | journal = Biol Res | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 517–9 | month =  | year = 2007 | doi =  10.4067/S0716-97602007000500012 | PMID = 18575683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartels and Zeki  describe it as "determining that it is the same (or a different) stimulus which is activating different cells in a given visual area or in different visual areas".&lt;ref name="Bartels 2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Bartels | first1 = A. | last2 = Zeki | first2 = S. | title = The temporal order of binding visual attributes. | journal = Vision Res | volume = 46 | issue = 14 | pages = 2280–6 | date = Jul 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.visres.2005.11.017 | PMID = 16387344 | url = http://www.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/fileadmin/user_upload/files/publications/Bartels2006_visualBinding_%5B0%5D.pdf }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experimental work===
Most experimental work is on vision, where it is known that humans and other mammals process different aspects of [[perception]] by separating information about those aspects and processing them in distinct regions of the brain. For example, Bartels and Zeki have shown that different areas in the [[visual cortex]] specialize in processing the different aspects of [[color vision|colour]], [[motion perception|motion]], and [[shape]]. This type of modular coding has been claimed to yield a potential for [[ambiguity]]. When humans view a scene containing a blue square and a yellow circle, some neurons signal in response to blue, others signal in response to yellow, still others to a square shape or a circle shape. Here, the binding problem is the issue of how the brain correctly pairs colour and shape, i.e. indicates that blue goes with square, rather than yellow.&lt;ref name="Bartels 2006"/&gt;

===Synchronization theory===
A popular hypothesis perhaps first suggested by Milner has been that features of individual objects are bound/segregated via [[neural oscillation|synchronisation]] of the activity of different neurons in the cortex.&lt;ref name="Milner 1974"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Milner PM |title=A model for visual shape recognition |journal=Psychol Rev |volume=81 |issue=6 |pages=521–35 |date=November 1974 |pmid=4445414 |doi=10.1037/h0037149 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shadlen 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shadlen MN, Movshon JA |title=Synchrony unbound: a critical evaluation of the temporal binding hypothesis |journal=Neuron |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=67–77, 111–25 |date=September 1999 |pmid=10677027 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)80822-3 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is that when two feature-neurons fire synchronously they are bound, while when they fire out of synchrony they are unbound. Empirical testing of the idea was given impetus when von der Malsburg  proposed that feature binding posed a special problem that could not be covered simply by cellular firing rates.&lt;ref&gt;von der Malsburg, C.

Schulten, eds. (Berlin: Springer).&lt;/ref&gt; A number of studies suggested that there is indeed a relationship between rhythmic synchronous firing and feature binding. This rhythmic firing appears to be linked to intrinsic oscillations in neuronal somatic potentials, typically in the [[gamma wave|gamma range]] close to 40&amp;nbsp;Hz.&lt;ref name="Engel 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Engel AK, König P, Gray CM, Singer W |title=Stimulus-Dependent Neuronal Oscillations in Cat Visual Cortex: Inter-Columnar Interaction as Determined by Cross-Correlation Analysis |journal=Eur.

The positive arguments for a role for rhythmic synchrony in resolving the segregational object-feature binding problem (BP1) have been summarized by Singer.&lt;ref name="Singer 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singer|first1=Wolf|title=Binding by synchrony| journal=Scholarpedia| volume=2| issue=12| year=2007|pages=1657|issn=1941-6016|doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.1657}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is certainly extensive evidence for synchronization of neural firing as part of responses to visual stimuli. However, there is inconsistency between findings from different laboratories. Moreover, a number of recent reviewers, including Shadlen and Movshon&lt;ref name="Shadlen 1999"/&gt; and Merker&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Merker B |title=Cortical gamma oscillations: the functional key is activation, not cognition |journal=Neurosci Biobehav Rev |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=401–17 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23333264 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2013.01.013 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have raised concerns.

Shadlen and Movshon,&lt;ref name="Shadlen 1999"/&gt; raise a series of doubts about both the theoretical and the empirical basis for the idea of segregational binding by temporal synchrony. Firstly, it is not clear that binding does pose a special computational problem of the sort proposed by von der Malsburg. Secondly, it is unclear how synchrony would come to play a distinct role in terms of local computational logic. Thirdly, it is difficult to envisage a situation in which pre-synaptic firing rate and synchrony could be usefully interpreted independently by a post-synaptic cell, since the two are interdependent over plausible time scales.

Another point that has been raised is that within standard time frames for neuronal firing very few distinct phases of synchrony would be distinguishable even under optimal conditions&lt;!--[15]--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} However, this would only be significant if the same pathways are potentially fed spike (signal) trains in multiple phases. In contrast, Seth&lt;ref name="Seth 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seth|first1=A. K.|title=Visual Binding Through Reentrant Connectivity and Dynamic Synchronization in a Brain-based Device|journal=Cerebral Cortex| volume=14| issue=11| year=2004| pages=1185–1199|doi=10.1093/cercor/bhh079| pmid=15142952}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes an artificial brain-based robot that demonstrates multiple, separate, widely distributed neural circuits, firing at different phases, suggesting that synchrony may assist the establishment of discrete object-related re-entrant circuits in a system exposed to randomly timed stimuli.

Goldfarb and Treisman&lt;ref name="Goldfarb 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Goldfarb | first1 = L. | last2 = Treisman | first2 = A. | title = Counting multidimensional objects: implications for the neural-synchrony theory. | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 266–71 |date=Mar 2013 | doi = 10.1177/0956797612459761 | PMID = 23334446 }}&lt;/ref&gt; point out that a logical problem appears to arise for binding solely via synchrony if there are several objects that share some of their features and not others. When viewing a display of variously coloured letters, internal representation of a red X, a green O, a red O and a green X cannot be accounted for purely by synchrony of signals for red and X shape, for instance. At best synchrony can facilitate segregation supported by other means (as von der Malsburg acknowledges&lt;ref name="von der Malsburg 1999"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = von der Malsburg | first1 = C. | title = The what and why of binding: the modeler's perspective. | journal = Neuron | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 95–104, 111–25 |date=Sep 1999 | url = http://cogprints.org/1488/5/cvdm.pdf | PMID = 10677030 | doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(00)80825-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

A number of neuropsychological studies suggest that the association of colour, shape and movement as "features of an object" is not simply a matter of linking or "binding". Purves and Lotto&lt;ref&gt;Purves, D. and Lotto, R. B. (2003) Why we see what we do: An empirical theory of vision. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; give extensive evidence for top-down feedback signals that ensure that sensory data are handled as features of (sometimes wrongly) postulated objects early in processing. In many illusions data appear as if pre-consciously adjusted in accordance with object expectations. Pylyshyn&lt;ref name="Pylyshyn 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Pylyshyn | first1 = ZW. | title = Visual indexes, preconceptual objects, and situated vision. | journal = Cognition | volume = 80 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 127–58 |date=Jun 2001 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(00)00156-6 | PMID = 11245842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has also emphasized the way the brain seems to pre-conceive objects to which features are to be allocated and which are attributed continuing existence even if features, like color  change.

===Feature integration theory===
In her [[feature integration theory]], [[Anne Treisman|Treisman]] suggested that binding between features is mediated by the features' links to a common location. Psychophysical demonstrations of binding failures under conditions of full [[attention]] provide support for the idea that binding is accomplished through common location tags.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1=Treisman, A. |author2=Gelade, G. |year=1980 |title=A feature integration theory of attention. |journal=Cognitive Psychology |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=97–136 |doi=10.1016/0010-0285(80)90005-5 |pmid=7351125 |url=http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/Psy355/Gilden/treisman.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905025042/http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/homepage/class/Psy355/Gilden/treisman.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An implication of these approaches is that sensory data such as colour or motion may not normally exist in "unallocated" form. For Merker:&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; "The 'red' of a red ball does not float disembodied in an abstract color space in V4." If colour information allocated to a point in the visual field is converted directly, via the instantiation of some form of propositional logic (analogous to that used in computer design) into colour information allocated to an "object identity" postulated by a top-down signal as suggested by Purves and Lotto, (e.g. There is blue here + Object 1 is here = Object 1 is blue) no special computational task of "binding together" by means such as synchrony may exist. (Although Von der Malsburg&lt;!--[18]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} poses the problem in terms of binding "propositions" such as "triangle" and "top", these, in isolation, are not propositional.)

How signals in the brain come to have propositional content, or meaning, is a much larger issue. However, both Marr&lt;ref&gt;Marr, D. C. (1982) Vision. New York, Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; and Barlow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barlow | first1 = H. | year = 1972 | title = Single units and sensation: A neuron doctrine for perceptual psychology? | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 1 | issue = 4| pages = 371–394 | doi=10.1068/p010371}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested, on the basis of what was known about neural connectivity in the 1970s that the final integration of features into a percept would be expected to resemble the way words operate in sentences.

The role of synchrony in segregational binding remains controversial. Merker&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; has recently suggested that synchrony may be a feature of areas of activation in the brain that relates to an "infrastructural" feature of the computational system analogous to increased oxygen demand indicated via MRI. Apparent specific correlations with segregational tasks may be explainable on the basis of interconnectivity of the areas involved. As a possible manifestation of a need to balance excitation and inhibition over time it might be expected to be associated with reciprocal re-entrant circuits as in the model of Seth et al.&lt;ref name="Seth 2004"/&gt; (Merker gives the analogy of the whistle from an audio amplifier receiving its own output.)

If it transpires that synchronized activity plays at most an infrastructural role in segregative computational "binding", the question arises as to whether we need another explanation. The implication both of Shadlen and Movshon's and of Merker's analyses seems to be that there may be no special binding problem in this sense. The problem may be merely an integral part of the more general problem of the computational logic used by neurons, or what is often referred to as the "neural code". In particular it may be inappropriate to analyse binding in perception without taking into account the way features are bound in memory, as addressed by Zimmer and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, H.D., Mecklinger, A. and Lindenberger, U. (2006) Binding in human memory: A neurocognitive approach. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and how that informs the way the brain pre-conceives objects&lt;!--[19,20]--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==The combination problem==

===Definition===
[[John Raymond Smythies|Smythies]]&lt;ref name="Smythies 1994"/&gt; defines BP2 as "How do the brain mechanisms actually construct the phenomenal object?". Revonsuo&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"/&gt; equates this to "[[consciousness]]-related binding", emphasizing the entailment of a phenomenal aspect. As Revonsuo explores in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;Revonsuo, A, (2006) Inner Presence: Consciousness as a biological phenomenon. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; there are nuances of difference beyond the basic BP1:BP2 division. Smythies speaks of constructing a phenomenal object ("local unity" for Revonsuo) but philosophers such as Descartes, Leibniz, Kant and James (see Brook and Raymont&lt;ref&gt;The Unity of Consciousness. Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy. http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consciousness-unity/&lt;/ref&gt;) have typically been concerned with the broader unity of a phenomenal experience ("global unity" for Revonsuo) – which, as Bayne&lt;ref name="Bayne"&gt;Bayne, T. and Chalmers, D. (2003) What is the unity of consciousness? In Cleeremans, A. The Unity of consciousness, Binding, Integration and Dissociation, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates may involve features as diverse as seeing a book, hearing a tune and feeling an emotion. Further discussion will focus on this more general problem of how sensory data that may have been segregated into, for instance, "blue square" and "yellow circle" are to be re-combined into a single phenomenal experience of a blue square next to a yellow circle, plus all other features of their context. There are a wide range of views on just how real this "unity" is, but the existence of medical conditions in which it appears to be subjectively impaired, or at least restricted, suggests that it is not entirely illusory&lt;!--[26]--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===History===
Early philosophers such as [[Descartes]] and [[Leibniz]]&lt;!--[26]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} noted that the apparent unity of our experience is an all-or-none qualitative characteristic that does not appear to have an equivalent in the known quantitative features, like proximity or cohesion, of composite matter. [[William James]]&lt;!--[5]--&gt;,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} in the nineteenth century, considered the ways the unity of consciousness might be explained by known physics and found no satisfactory answer. He coined the term "combination problem", in the specific context of a "mind-dust theory" in which it is proposed that a full human conscious experience is built up from proto- or micro-experiences in the way that matter is built up from atoms. James claimed that such a theory was incoherent, since no causal physical account could be given of how distributed proto-experiences would "combine". He favoured instead a concept of "co-consciousness" in which there is one "experience of A, B and C" rather than combined experiences. A detailed discussion of subsequent philosophical positions is given by Brook and Raymont (see 26). However, these do not generally include physical interpretations. James&lt;!--[5]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} remained concerned about the absence of a "single physical thing", other than an atom, that could be co-conscious (of A, B and C), echoing Leibniz.

[[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]&lt;ref&gt;Whitehead, A. N. (1929) Process and Reality. 1979 corrected edition, edited by David Ray Griffin and Donald W. Sherburne, Free Press. {{ISBN|0-02-934570-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a fundamental ontological basis for a relation consistent with James's idea of co-consciousness, in which many causal elements are co-available or "compresent" in a single event or "occasion" that constitutes a unified experience. Whitehead did not give physical specifics but the idea of compresence is framed in terms of causal convergence in a local interaction consistent with physics. Where Whitehead goes beyond anything formally recognized in physics is in the "chunking" of causal relations into complex but discrete "occasions". Even if such occasions can be defined, Whitehead's approach still leaves James's difficulty with finding a site, or sites, of causal convergence that would make neurobiological sense for "co-consciousness". Sites of signal convergence do clearly exist throughout the brain but there is a concern to avoid re-inventing what [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]]&lt;ref name="Dennett"&gt;Dennett, D.C. (1978) Brainstorms (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press)&lt;/ref&gt; calls a Cartesian Theater or single central site of convergence of the form that Descartes proposed.

Descartes's central "soul" is now rejected because neural activity closely correlated with conscious perception is widely distributed throughout the cortex. The remaining choices appear to be either separate involvement of multiple distributed causally convergent events or a model that does not tie a phenomenal experience to any specific local physical event but rather to some overall "functional" capacity. Whichever interpretation is taken, as Revonsuo&lt;ref name="Revonsuo 1999"/&gt; indicates, there is no consensus on what structural level we are dealing with – whether the cellular level, that of cellular groups as "nodes", "complexes" or "assemblies" or that of widely distributed networks. There is probably only general agreement that it is not the level of the whole brain, since there is evidence that signals in certain primary sensory areas, such as the V1 region of the visual cortex (in addition to motor areas and cerebellum), do not contribute directly to phenomenal experience.

===Modern theories===
Dennett&lt;ref name="Dennett"/&gt; has proposed that our sense that our experiences are single events is illusory and that, instead, at any one time there are "multiple drafts" of sensory patterns at multiple sites. Each would only cover a fragment of what we think we experience. Arguably, Dennett is claiming that consciousness is not unified and there is no phenomenal binding problem. Most philosophers have difficulty with this position (see Bayne&lt;ref name="Bayne"/&gt;). Dennett's view might be in keeping with evidence from recall experiments and change blindness purporting to show that our experiences are much less rich than we sense them to be – what has been called the Grand Illusion.&lt;ref&gt;Blackmore, S. J., Brelstaff, G., Nelson, K., Troscianko, T. (1995), "Is the richness of our visual world an illusion? Transsaccadic memory for complex scenes", Perception, 24, pp. 1075–81.&lt;/ref&gt; However, few, if any, other authors suggest the existence of multiple partial "drafts". Moreover, also on the basis of recall experiments, Lamme&lt;ref name="Lamme"&gt;Lamme, V. (2002) The grand Grand Illusion illusion. Journal of Consciousness Studies, 9, 141–157.&lt;/ref&gt; has challenged the idea that richness is illusory, emphasizing that phenomenal content cannot be equated with content to which there is cognitive access.

Dennett does not tie drafts to biophysical events. Multiple sites of causal convergence are invoked in specific biophysical terms by Edwards&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J. C. (2005) Is consciousness only a property of individual cells? Journal of Consciousness Studies 12, 4-5, 60–76. Available at http://www.ucl.ac.uk/jonathan-edwards&lt;/ref&gt; and Sevush.&lt;ref&gt;Sevush, S. (2006) Single neuron theory of consciousness. J. Theoretical Biology 238, 704–725.&lt;/ref&gt; In this view the sensory signals to be combined in phenomenal experience are available, in full, at each of multiple sites. To avoid non-causal combination each site/event is placed within an individual neuronal dendritic tree. The advantage is that "compresence" is invoked just where convergence occurs neuro-anatomically. The disadvantage, as for Dennett, is the counter-intuitive concept of multiple "copies" of experience. The precise nature of an experiential event or "occasion", even if local, also remains uncertain.

The majority of theoretical frameworks for the unified richness of phenomenal experience adhere to the intuitive idea that experience exists as a single copy, and draw on "functional" descriptions of distributed networks of cells. Baars&lt;ref&gt;Baars, B. J. (1997), In the Theater of Consciousness New York, Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has suggested that certain signals, encoding what we experience, enter a "Global Workspace" within which they are "broadcast" to many sites in the cortex for parallel processing. Dehaene, Changeux and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Dehaene, S., Sergent, C. and Changeux, J.-P. (2003). A neuronal network model linking subjective reports and objective physiological data during conscious perception. Proc. National Academy of Science (USA) 100. 14: 8520–8525.&lt;/ref&gt; have developed a detailed neuro-anatomical version of such a workspace. Tononi and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Balduzzi D, Tononi G. (2008) Integrated information in discrete dynamical systems: motivation and theoretical framework. ''PLoS Comput Biol''. 4(6):e1000091. doi: 10.1371/ journal.pcbi.1000091&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the level of richness of an experience is determined by the narrowest information interface "bottleneck" in the largest sub-network or "complex" that acts as an integrated functional unit. Lamme&lt;ref name="Lamme"/&gt; has suggested that networks supporting reciprocal signaling rather than those merely involved in feed-forward signaling support experience. Edelman and colleagues have also emphasized the importance of re-entrant signaling&lt;!--[16]--&gt;.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Cleeremans&lt;ref&gt;Cleeremans, A. (2011) The radical plasticity thesis. Frontiers in Psychology 2, Article 86 {{DOI|10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00086}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizes meta-representation as the functional signature of signals contributing to consciousness.

In general, such network-based theories are not explicitly theories of how consciousness is unified, or "bound" but rather theories of functional domains within which signals contribute to unified conscious experience. A concern about functional domains is what Rosenberg&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, G. (2004) A Place for Consciousness. Oxford, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-516814-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has called the boundary problem; it is hard to find a unique account of what is to be included and what excluded. Nevertheless, this is, if anything is, the consensus approach.

Within the network context, a role for synchrony has been invoked as a solution to the phenomenal binding problem as well as the computational one. In his book, [[The Astonishing Hypothesis]],&lt;ref&gt;Crick, F. (1995) The Astonishing Hypothesis. Scribner Paperback {{ISBN|0-684-80158-2}} {{ISBN|978-0684801582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crick appears to be offering a solution to BP2 as much as BP1. Even von der Malsburg,&lt;!--[19]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} introduces detailed computational arguments about object feature binding with remarks about a "psychological moment". The Singer group&lt;!--[14]--&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} also appear to be interested as much in the role of synchrony in phenomenal awareness as in computational segregation.

The apparent incompatibility of using synchrony to both segregate and unify might be explained by sequential roles. However, Merker&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; points out what appears to be a contradiction in attempts to solve the phenomenal unification problem (BP2) in terms of a functional (effectively meaning computational) rather than a local biophysical, domain, in the context of synchrony.

Functional arguments for a role for synchrony are in fact underpinned by analysis of local biophysical events. However, Merker&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; points out that the explanatory work is done by the downstream integration of synchronized signals in post-synaptic neurons: "It is, however, by no means clear what is to be understood by 'binding by synchrony' other than the threshold advantage conferred by synchrony at, and only at, sites of axonal convergence onto single dendritic trees..." In other words, although synchrony is proposed as a way of explaining binding on a distributed, rather than a convergent, basis the justification rests on what happens at convergence. Signals for two features are proposed as bound by synchrony because synchrony effects downstream convergent interaction. Any theory of phenomenal binding based on this sort of computational function would seem to follow the same principle. The phenomenality would entail convergence, if the computational function does.

Although BP1 and BP2 are different, this need not invalidate the assumption, implicit in many of the quoted models, that computational and phenomenal events, at least at some point in the sequence of events, parallel each other in some way. The difficulty remains in identifying what that way might be. Merker's&lt;ref name="Merker 2013"/&gt; analysis suggests that either (1) both computational and phenomenal aspects of binding are determined by convergence of signals on neuronal dendritic trees, or (2) that our intuitive ideas about the need for "binding" in a "holding together" sense in both computational and phenomenal contexts are misconceived. We may be looking for something extra that is not needed. Merker, for instance, argues that the homotopic connectivity of sensory pathways does the necessary work.

The nature of, and solution to, BP2 remains a matter of controversy.

A new study published in [[Psychological Review]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://content.apa.org/journals/rev/125/4/545|title=The emergence of polychronization and feature binding in a spiking neural network model of the primate ventral visual system|author1=Eguchi A.|author2=et al.,|date=2018|publisher=Psychological Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[Interface Focus|''Interface Focus'']] 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rsfs.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/8/4/20180021.e-letters|author1=Isbister, J.|author2 = et al.| year = 2018|title=A new approach to solving the feature-binding problem in primate vision|work=|format=| publisher = The Royal Society| DOI=10.1098/rsfs.2018.0021}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[Royal Society|Royal Society's]] cross-disciplinary journal at the interface between the physical and life sciences, sheds new light on how the visual system may represent which features are bound together as part of the same object. 

The research team, [http://www.oftnai.org the Oxford Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oftnai.org |title=Oxford Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience and Artificial Intelligence|work=|format=|}} &lt;/ref&gt; , led by Dr [[Simon Stringer]] from [[University of Oxford]], performed bio-inspired [[Spiking neural network|Spiking Neural Network]] simulations of the primate ventral visual system to address this enduring question. By training the biophysical model on a set of visual stimuli, has been observed the emergence of a subpopulation of [[neurons]], called ''polychronous neuronal groups'' (PNG), that exhibits regularly repeating spatio-temporal patterns of spikes. The underlying phenomenon of such spatio-temporal patterns responses is known as polychronization&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/089976606775093882|title=Polychronization: computation with spikes|last=Izhikevich|first=EM,|date=2006|publisher=Neural Computation}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The main point of this proposed novel approach is that within these PNGs exist neurons, called ''binding neurons'', that learn to represent the hierarchical binding relationships between lower and higher level visual features at every spatial scale and across the entire visual field. These binding neurons have been firstly formulated by [[Christoph von der Malsburg]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(00)80825-9|title=The What and Why of Binding|last=von der Malsburg|first=Christoph,|date=1999|publisher=Cell Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; , however, it has not previously been shown how these neurons may develop naturally through a biologically plausible process of visually guided learning and self-organization of polychronous neuronal groups. This latest research describe that such binding neurons emerge automatically within the PNGs during visually training when key properties of the visual cortex are incorporated into the model. This finding is consistent with the hierarchical nature of primate vision depicted by John Duncan &amp; [[Glyn W. Humphreys]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A fully hierarchical representation is created by repeating segmentation at different levels of scale. Each structural unit, contained by its own boundary, is further subdivided into parts by the major boundaries within it. Thus, a human body may be subdivided into head, torso, and limbs, and a hand into palm and fingers. Such subdivision serves two purposes. The description of a structural unit at one level of scale (animal, letter, etc.) must depend heavily on the relations between the parts defined within it (as well as on properties such as colour or movement that may be common to the parts). Then, at the next level down, each part becomes a new structural unit to be further described with its own properties, defined among other things by the relations between its own subparts. At the top of the hierarchy may be a structural unit corresponding to the whole input scene, described with a rough set of properties (e.g. division into light sky above and dark ground below)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www2.psychology.uiowa.edu/faculty/hollingworth/prosem/Duncan_Humphreys_89_PR_VisualSearchStimulus.pdf|title=Visual Search and Stimulus Similarity|author1=Duncan J.|author2=Humphreys GW.|date=1989|publisher=Psychological Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, this hierarchy feature binding theory proposes that information about visual features at every spatial scale, including the binding relations between these features, would be projected upwards to the higher layers of the network, where spatial information would be available for readout by later brain systems to guide behavior. This mechanism has been called  the ''holographic principle''. Lastly, by representing the hierarchical binding relationships between visual features at every spatial scale across a visual scene, these kinds of binding neurons could underpin visual consciousness itself, the capacity of the visual brain to perceive and make sense of its visuospatial world. Therefore, this work may represent a significant advancement towards the future development of [[Artificial General Intelligence]] and [[Machine Consciousness]], opening up new perspectives on building machines endowed with human-level intelligence.&lt;ref&gt; {{Citeweb|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/intelligent-machines-are-starting-to-catch-up-ps2f5m0j6|date=August 2018|title=Intelligent machines are starting to catch up|publisher = The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Boehme's giant day gecko''' (''Phelsuma madagascariensis boehmei'') is a [[diurnal animal|diurnal]] [[species]] of [[gecko]], a lizard in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Gekkonidae]]. The species is [[Endemism|endemic]] to eastern [[Madagascar]] and typically inhabits rainforests and dwells on trees. Boehme's giant day gecko feeds on insects and nectar.

==Etymology==
Both the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]], ''boehmei'', and the common name, Boehme's giant day gecko, are in honor of German herpetologist [[:de:Wolfgang Böhme (Zoologe)|Wolfgang Böhme]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harald Meier|Meier, Harald]] (1982). "''Ergebnisse zur Taxonomie und Ökologie einiger Arten und Unterarten der Gattung ''Phelsuma'' auf Madagaskar, gesammelt in den Jahren 1972 bis 1981, mit Beschreibung einer neuen Form'' ". ''Salamandra'' '''18''' (3/4): 168-190. (''Phelsuma madagascariensis boehmei'', new subspecies, pp. 183-186). (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''P. m. boehmei'' is among the largest living day geckos. It can reach a total length of about {{convert|22|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The body colour is bright green. The skin between the scales has a black colour. A  dark red-coloured stripe extends from the nostril to behind the eye. On the head and back there are irregularly shaped brownish or red-brick-coloured dots.

==Geographic range==
Boehme's giant day gecko only inhabits the region around Andasibe and [[Ranomafana National Park|Ranomafana]] in eastern Madagascar.

==Habitat==
''P. m. boehmei'' is a rainforest species and is often found on trees high in the canopy. The east coast of Madagascar has a humid and warm climate. However, from June–August, the night temperature can be as low as 10&amp;nbsp;°C (50&amp;nbsp;°F) and around 20–25&amp;nbsp;°C (68–77&amp;nbsp;°F) during the day.

==Diet==
Boehme's giant day gecko feeds on various insects and other invertebrates. It also likes to lick soft, sweet fruit, pollen and nectar.

==Behaviour==
''P. m. boehmei'' is apparently not as quarrelsome as other members of the genus ''Phelsuma''.

==Reproduction==
The pairing season of Boehme's giant day gecko is between November and January. During this period, the females lay up to 6 pairs of eggs. At a temperature of 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82.4&amp;nbsp;°F), the young will hatch after approximately 48–55 days. The hatchlings measure {{convert|60|–|65|mm|in|abbr=on}}.

==Care and maintenance in captivity==
''P. m. boehmei'' should be housed in pairs, and needs a large, well planted terrarium. The humidity should be maintained between 75 and 100%. It is often suggested (McKeown, 1993; Henkel &amp; Schmidt, 1995) that the daytime temperature should be between 25 and 28&amp;nbsp;°C (77 and 82.4&amp;nbsp;°F) between November and January. These authors also suggest that between July and August, the daytime temperature should be 25&amp;nbsp;°C (77&amp;nbsp;°F) while dropping it to 15&amp;nbsp;°C (59&amp;nbsp;°F) at night. This way one simulates the rainforest environment. However, the period between July and August corresponds with the warmest months on the northern hemisphere so active cooling might be necessary. For some breeders it therefore may be more adequate to shift this essential drop in temperature to the colder months (November–January) and the higher temperature to the months April–August.  In captivity, ''P. m. boehmei'' can be fed with crickets, wax moths, fruit flies, mealworms, and houseflies.

In [[type theory]], '''bounded quantification''' (also '''bounded polymorphism''' or '''constrained genericity''') refers to [[universally quantified|universal]] or [[existential type|existential quantifier]]s which are restricted ("bounded") to range only over the subtypes of a particular type. Bounded quantification is an interaction of [[parametric polymorphism]] with [[subtyping]]. Bounded quantification has traditionally been studied in the [[functional programming|functional]] setting of [[System F-sub|System F&lt;sub&gt;&lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;]], but is available in modern [[object-oriented language]]s supporting [[parametric polymorphism]] ([[Generic programming|generics]]) such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]].

== Overview ==
The purpose of bounded quantification is to allow for [[polymorphic function]]s to depend on some specific behaviour of objects instead of [[type inheritance]]. It assumes a record-based model for object classes, where every class member is a record element and all class members are named functions. Object attributes are represented as functions that take no argument and return an object. The specific behaviour is then some function name along with the types of the arguments and the return type. Bounded quantification allows to considers all objects with such a function. An example would be a polymorphic &lt;code&gt;min&lt;/code&gt; function that considers all objects that are comparable to each other.

=== F-bounded quantification ===
'''''F''-bounded quantification''' or '''recursively bounded quantification''', introduced in 1989, allows for more precise typing of functions that are applied on recursive types. A recursive type is one that includes a function that uses it as a type for some argument or its return value.&lt;ref&gt;''F''-bounded polymorphism for object-oriented programming. Canning, [[William Cook (computer scientist)|Cook]], Hill, Olthof and [[John C. Mitchell|Mitchell]]. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=99392&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
This kind of type constraint can be expressed in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] with a generic interface. The following example demonstrates how to describe types that can be compared to each other and use this as typing information in [[polymorphic function]]s. The &lt;code&gt;Test.min&lt;/code&gt; function uses simple bounded quantification and does not preserve the type of the assigned types, in contrast with the &lt;code&gt;Test.Fmin&lt;/code&gt; function which uses F-bounded quantification.

In mathematical notation, the types of the two functions are

:min: ∀ T, ∀ S ⊆ {compareTo: T → int}. S → S → S
:Fmin: ∀ T ⊆ Comparable[T]. T → T → T

where

:Comparable[T] = {compareTo: T → int}

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
interface Comparable&lt;T&gt; {
  public int compareTo(T other);
}

class Integer implements Comparable&lt;Integer&gt; {
  @Override
  public int compareTo(Integer other) {
    //...
  }
}

class String implements Comparable&lt;String&gt; {
  @Override
  public int compareTo(String other) {
    //...
  }
}

class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Comparable&lt;String&gt; a = min("cat", "dog");
    Comparable&lt;Integer&gt; b = min(new Integer(10), new Integer(3));
    String str = Fmin("cat", "dog");
    Integer i = Fmin(new Integer(10), new Integer(3));
  }
  public static &lt;S extends Comparable&gt; S min(S a, S b) {
    if (a.compareTo(b) &lt;= 0)
      return a;
    else
      return b;
  }
  public static &lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;&gt; T Fmin(T a, T b) {
    if (a.compareTo(b) &lt;= 0)
      return a;
    else
      return b;
  }
}

'''Carlos Ginzburg''' is a [[conceptual artist]] and theoretician born in 1946 in [[La Plata]], [[Argentina]]. He studied [[philosophy]] and social theory.

==Biography==

[[Germano Celant]], when writing about [[Arte Povera]], invited Ginzburg by letter to join his movement.

As a conceptual artist interested in [[digital art]], [[fractals]] [[chaos theory|chaos]] and [[fractal art]], Ginzburg created what he calls "homo fractalus" – a concept about microcosm totality.&lt;ref&gt;http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/leonardo/v034/34.1ginzburg.html The Leonardo Gallery : Carlos Ginzburg&lt;/ref&gt;

He has worked with the art critic [[Pierre Restany]] (with whom he developed the concept of "Political Ecology")&lt;ref&gt;Curator Pierre Restany, Political Ecology, White Box, New York, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Severo Sarduy]] who put him near [[Hokusai]] in "Barroco", one of the reference's books to ''Le Pli'' of [[Gilles Deleuze]].

He lives in Paris and works, since 2005, with the art criticism and French artist [[KolbaSha/Tschann]] on chaos's destruction and advent paradise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2988">A '''challenge''' is a request made to the holder of a competitive title for a [[match (game)|match]] between champion and challenger, the winner of which will acquire or retain the title.  In some cases the champion has the right to refuse a challenge; in others, this results in forfeiting the title. The challenge system derives from [[duelling]] and its [[warrior code|code of honour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gorn|first=Elliott  J.|date=Fall 1986|title=John L. Sullivan: 'The champion of all champions'|journal=The Virginia Quarterly Review|volume=62|issue=4|page=614}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many competitive [[sports]] use some form of [[tournament]] to determine champions, a '''challenge match''' is the normal way of deciding [[professional boxing]] titles and the [[World Chess Championship]]. Some [[racket sport]]s clubs have a reigning champion who may be challenged by any other club member; a [[ladder tournament]] extends the challenge concept to all players, not just the reigning champion. At élite-level competition, there is usually some governing body which authorises and regulates challenges, such as [[FIDE]] in chess. In some cases there is a challengers' tournament, the winner of which gains the right to play the '''challenge round''' against the reigning champion; in tennis this was the case at [[Wimbledon championships|Wimbledon]] until 1922 and in the [[Davis Cup]] until 1972.&lt;ref name="Grasso2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grasso|first=John|title=Historical Dictionary of Tennis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W39oSS7c2xAC&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=13 November 2015|date=2011-09-16|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810872370|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FA Cup]]'s official name remains the "Football Association Challenge Cup", although not since [[1872–73 FA Cup|its second season]] in 1873 has the reigning champion receive a bye to [[FA Cup Final|the final]]. The [[America's Cup]] is contested  according to the terms of its [[Deed of Gift of the America's Cup|1887 deed of gift]] between yachts representing the champion yacht club and a challenging club. Since 1970, the usual practice, by mutual consent, is for an initial formal "challenger of record" replaced by the actual challenger after [[Herbert Pell Cup|a qualifying tournament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cupinfo.com/en/americas-cup-brief-history-challenger-of-record-01.php|title=America's Cup - A Brief History of the Challenger of Record 1970-2017 - from CupInfo|publisher=CupInfo|accessdate=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[1988 America's Cup|1988]] and [[2010 America's Cup|2010]] there were court cases arising from non-consensual challenges.

When the champion dies or otherwise vacates the title, a [[tournament]] among leading contenders may be used to crown a new champion prior to the resumption of challenges.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1908">'''Classical fluids'''&lt;ref&gt;R. Balescu, ''Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Statistical Mechanics'', (John Wiley, 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; are systems of particles which retain a definite volume, and are at sufficiently high temperatures (compared to their [[Fermi Energy|Fermi energy]]) that [[quantum]] effects can be neglected. A system of [[hard spheres]], interacting only by hard collisions (e.g., billiards, marbles), is a model classical fluid. Such a system is well described by the [[Percus–Yevick approximation|Percus-Yevik equation]]. Common liquids, e.g., liquid air, gasoline etc., are essentially mixtures of classical fluids. Electrolytes, molten salts, salts dissolved in water, are classical charged fluids. A classical fluid when cooled undergoes a freezing transition. On heating it undergoes an evaporation transition and becomes a classical gas that obeys [[Boltzmann]] statistics.
 
A system of charged classical particles moving in a uniform positive neutralizing background is known as a one-component plasma (OCP). This is well described by the Hyper-netted chain equation (see [[Classical-map hypernetted-chain method|CHNC]]). 
An essentially very accurate way of determining the properties of classical fluids is provided by the method of [[molecular dynamics]].
An [[Free electron model|electron gas confined in a metal]] is NOT a classical fluid, whereas a very high-temperature plasma of electrons could behave as a classical fluid. Such non-classical [[Fermi gas|Fermi systems]], i.e., quantum fluids, can be studied using [[quantum Monte Carlo]] methods, Feynman [[path integral formulation|path integral]] equation methods, and  approximately via [[Classical-map hypernetted-chain method|CHNC]] integral-equation methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17356">The '''cobweb model''' or '''cobweb theory''' is an [[economic model]] that explains why [[price]]s might be subject to periodic fluctuations in certain types of [[Market (economics)|market]]s. It describes cyclical [[supply and demand]] in a market where the amount [[Production, costs, and pricing|produced]] must be chosen before prices are observed. Producers' [[Expected value|expectation]]s about prices are assumed to be based on observations of previous prices. [[Nicholas Kaldor]] analyzed the model in 1934, coining the term "cobweb theorem" (see Kaldor, 1938 and Pashigian, 2008), citing previous analyses in German by [[Henry Schultz]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Umberto Ricci|it|3=Umberto Ricci (economista)}}.

== The model ==
[[File:Cobweb theory (convergent).svg|thumb|The ''convergent'' case: each new outcome is successively closer to the intersection of supply and demand.]]
[[File:Cobweb theory (divergent).svg|thumb|The ''divergent'' case: each new outcome is successively further from the intersection of supply and demand.]]
The cobweb model is based on a time lag between supply and demand decisions. Agricultural markets are a context where the cobweb model might apply, since there is a lag between planting and [[harvest]]ing (Kaldor, 1934, p.&amp;nbsp;133-134 gives two agricultural examples: rubber and corn). Suppose for example that as a result of unexpectedly bad weather, farmers go to market with an unusually small crop of strawberries. This shortage, equivalent to a leftward shift in the market's [[supply curve]], results in high prices. If farmers expect these high price conditions to continue, then in the following year, they will raise their production of strawberries relative to other crops. Therefore, when they go to market the supply will be high, resulting in low prices. If they then expect low prices to continue, they will decrease their production of strawberries for the next year, resulting in high prices again.

This process is illustrated by the adjacent diagrams. The [[equilibrium price]] is at the intersection of the supply and demand curves. A poor harvest in period&amp;nbsp;1 means supply falls to Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, so that prices rise to P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If producers plan their period&amp;nbsp;2 production under the expectation that this high price will continue, then the period&amp;nbsp;2 supply will be higher, at Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Prices therefore fall to P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when they try to sell all their output. As this process repeats itself, oscillating between periods of low supply with high prices and then high supply with low prices, the price and quantity trace out a spiral. They may spiral inwards, as in the top figure, in which case the economy converges to the equilibrium where supply and demand cross; or they may spiral outwards, with the fluctuations increasing in magnitude.

The cobweb model can have two types of outcomes:
* If the supply curve is steeper than the demand curve, then the fluctuations decrease in magnitude with each cycle, so a plot of the prices and quantities over time would look like an inward spiral, as shown in the first diagram. This is called the stable or ''convergent'' case.
* If the slope of the supply curve is less than the absolute value of the slope of the demand curve, then the fluctuations increase in magnitude with each cycle, so that prices and quantities spiral outwards. This is called the unstable or ''divergent'' case.

Two other possibilities are:
* Fluctuations may also remain of constant magnitude, so a plot of the outcomes would produce a simple rectangle, if the supply and demand curves have exactly the same slope (in absolute value).
* If the supply curve is less steep than the demand curve near the point where the two curves cross, but more steep when we move sufficiently far away, then prices and quantities will spiral away from the equilibrium price but will not diverge indefinitely; instead, they may converge to a [[limit cycle]].

In either of the first two scenarios, the combination of the spiral and the supply and demand curves often looks like a [[Spider web|cobweb]], hence the name of the theory.

== Elasticities versus slopes ==
The outcomes of the cobweb model are stated above in terms of slopes, but they are more commonly described in terms of elasticities. In terms of slopes, the ''convergent case'' requires that the slope of the supply curve be greater than the absolute value of the slope of the demand curve:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dP^S}{dQ^S} &gt; \left|\frac{dP^D}{dQ^D}\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

In standard [[microeconomics]] terminology, define the ''[[Price elasticity of supply|elasticity of supply]]'' as &lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ^S/Q^S}{dP^S/P^S}&lt;/math&gt;, and the ''[[Price elasticity of demand|elasticity of demand]]'' as &lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ^D/Q^D}{dP^D/P^D}&lt;/math&gt;. If we evaluate these two elasticities at the equilibrium point, that is &lt;math&gt;P^S=P^D=P&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q^S=Q^D=Q&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, then we see that the ''convergent case'' requires
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ^S/Q}{dP^S/P}&lt;\left|\frac{dQ^D/Q}{dP^D/P}\right|,&lt;/math&gt;
whereas the ''divergent case'' requires
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dQ^S/Q}{dP^S/P}&gt;\left|\frac{dQ^D/Q}{dP^D/P}\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

In words, the ''convergent case'' occurs when the demand curve is more elastic than the supply curve, at the equilibrium point. The ''divergent case'' occurs when the supply curve is more elastic than the demand curve, at the equilibrium point (see Kaldor, 1934, page 135, propositions (i) and (ii).)

== Role of expectations ==
One reason to be skeptical of this model's predictions is that it assumes producers are extremely shortsighted. Assuming that farmers look back at the most recent prices in order to forecast future prices might seem very reasonable, but this backward-looking forecasting (which is called [[adaptive expectations]]) turns out to be crucial for the model's fluctuations. When farmers expect high prices to continue, they produce too much and therefore end up with low prices, and vice versa.

In the stable case, this may not be an unbelievable outcome, since the farmers' prediction errors (the difference between the price they expect and the price that actually occurs) become smaller every period. In this case, after several periods prices and quantities will come close to the point where supply and demand cross, and predicted prices will be very close to actual prices. But in the unstable case, the farmers' errors get ''larger'' every period. This seems to indicate that [[adaptive expectations]] is a misleading assumption—how could farmers fail to notice that last period's price is ''not'' a good predictor of this period's price?

The fact that [[Agent (economics)|agents]] with adaptive expectations may make ever-increasing errors over time has led many economists to conclude that it is better to assume [[rational expectations]], that is, expectations consistent with the actual structure of the economy. However, the rational expectations assumption is controversial since it may exaggerate agents' understanding of the economy. The cobweb model serves as one of the best examples to illustrate why understanding [[Expectation (epistemic)|expectation]] formation is so important for understanding economic dynamics, and also why expectations are so controversial in recent economic theory.

=== The "Anpassung nach Unten" and "Schraube nach Unten" argument ===
{{Confusing|date=May 2017}}
The German concepts which translate literally "adjustment to lower" and "screw to lower" are known from the works of Hans-Peter Martin and Harald Schumann, the authors of ''[[The Global Trap]]''. Martin and Schumann see the process to worsened living standards as screw-shaped. Mordecai Ezekiel's ''[[The Cobweb Theorem]]'' (1938) illustrate a screw-shaped expectations-driven process.&lt;ref&gt;Ezekiel, Mordecai: "The Cobweb Theorem". ''The Quarterly Journal of Economics'', vol. 52, No. 2 (Feb. 1938) pp. 255–280.&lt;/ref&gt; Eino Haikala has analyzed Ezekiel's work among others, and clarified that time constitutes the axis of the screw-shape.&lt;ref&gt;Haikala, Eino: Maatalouden ominaissuhdanteet ja cobweb-teoria (1956). Pellervo.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Martin and Schumann point out that the cobweb theorem works to worsen standards of living as well. The idea of expectations-variation and thus modeled and induced expectations is shown clearly in Oskar Morgenstern's ''Vollkommene Voraussicht und Wirtschaftliches Gleichgewicht''.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenstern, Oskar: Vollkommene Voraussicht und wirtschaftliches Gleichgewicht. Zeitschrift fur Nationalekonomie Bd. 6 (1935) pp. 337–357.&lt;/ref&gt; This article shows also that the concept of perfect foresight (vollkommene Voraussicht) is not a Robert E. Lucas or rational expectations invention but rests in [[game theory]], Morgenstern and John von Neumann being the authors of ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]''. This does not mean that the [[rational expectations|rational expectations hypothesis]] (REH) is not game theory or separate from the cobweb theorem, but vice versa. The "there must be" a random component claim by [[Alan A. Walters]] alone shows that rational (consistent) expectations is game theory,&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Alan A.: "Consistent Expectations, Distributed Lags and the Quantity Theory". ''The Economic Journal'' 81 (322) (Feb. 1971) pp. 273–281.&lt;/ref&gt; since the component is there to create an illusion of [[random walk]].

Alan A. Walters (1971) also claims that "extrapolators" are "unsophisticated", thus differentiating between [[prediction]] and [[forecasting]]. Using induced modeled expectations is prediction, not forecasting, unless these expectations are based on extrapolation. A prediction does not have to even try to be true. To avoid a prediction to be falsified it has to be, according to Franco Modigliani and Emile Grunberg's article "The Predictability of Social Events", kept private.&lt;ref&gt;Modogliani, Franco &amp; Grunberg, Emile: "The Predictability of Social Events". ''Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 62, No. 6 (Dec. 1954) pp. 465–478.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus public prediction serves private one in REH. Haikala (1956) claims that cobweb theorem is a theorem of deceiving farmers, thus seeing cobweb theorem as a kind of rational or rather, consistent, expectations model with a game-theoretic feature. This makes sense{{Says who|date=February 2017}} when considering the argument of Hans-Peter Martin and Harald Schumann. The [[Truth value|truth-value]] of a prediction is one measure in differentiating between non-deceiving and deceiving models. In Martin and Schumann's context, a claim that anti-Keynesian policies lead to a greater welfare of the majority of mankind should be analyzed in terms of truth. One way to do this is to investigate past historical data. This is contrary to the principles of REH, where the measure of policies is an economic model,&lt;ref&gt;Kydland, Finn E. &amp; Prescott, Edward: Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans. ''Journal of Political Economy'', Vol. 85, No. 3 (Jun. 1977) pp. 473–492.&lt;/ref&gt; not reality, and credibility, not truth. The importance of intellectual climate emphasized in Friedmans' work&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Milton &amp; Friedman, Rose: Free to Choose.&lt;/ref&gt; means that the credibility of a prediction can be increased by manipulating public opinion, despite its lack of truth. Morgenstern (1935) states that when varying expectations, the expectation of future has always to be positive (and prediction has to be credible).

Expectation is a dynamic component in both REH and cobweb theorem, and the question of expectation formation is the key to Hans-Peter Martin's and Harald Schumann's argument, which deals with trading current welfare for expected future welfare with actually worsening policies in the middle. This 'in order to achieve that then we have to do this now' is the key in [[Bertrand de Jouvenel]]'s work. Cobweb theorem and the rational (consistent) expectations hypothesis are part of [[welfare economics]] which according to Martin and Schumann's argument act now to worsen the welfare of the majority of mankind. [[Nicholas Kaldor's]] work ''The Scourge of Monetarism'' is an analysis of how the policies described by Martin and Schumann came to the United Kingdom.

== Evidence ==

=== Livestock herds ===

The cobweb model has been interpreted as an explanation of fluctuations in various [[livestock]] markets, like those documented by Arthur Hanau in German hog markets; see [[Pork cycle]]. However, Rosen et al. (1994) proposed an alternative model which showed that because of the three-year life cycle of beef cattle, cattle populations would fluctuate over time even if ranchers had perfectly [[rational expectations]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lotterman, [http://www.twincities.com/lotterman/ci_20293708/shipping-cattle-and-some-careers-cycles-play-out "In shipping, cattle and some careers, cycles play out"], Twin Cities Pioneer Press, 4. April 2012: Real World Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Human experimental data ===
In 1989, Wellford conducted twelve experimental sessions each conducted with five participants over thirty periods simulating the stable and unstable cases. Her results show that the unstable case did not result in the divergent behavior we see with cobweb expectations but rather the participants converged toward the [[rational expectations]] equilibrium. However, the price path variance in the unstable case was greater than that in the stable case (and the difference was shown to be statistically significant).

One way of interpreting these results is to say that in the [[Long run and short run|long run]], the participants behaved as if they had rational expectations, but that in the short run they made mistakes. These mistakes caused larger fluctuations in the unstable case than in the stable case.

=== Housing sector in Israel ===

The residential construction sector of [[Israel]] was, primarily as a result of [[Bricha|waves of immigration]], and still is, a principal factor in the structure of the [[business cycles]] in Israel. The increasing population, financing methods, higher income, and investment needs converged and came to be reflected through the skyrocketing demand for housing. On the other hand, technology, private and public entrepreneurship, the housing inventory and the availability of workforce have converged on the supply side. The position and direction of the housing sector in the business cycle can be identified by using a cobweb model (see Tamari, 1981).

'''Corel Painter''' is a [[raster graphics|raster-based]] [[digital art]] application created to simulate as accurately as possible the appearance and behavior of [[Media (arts)|traditional media]] associated with [[drawing]], [[painting]], and [[printmaking]]. It is intended to be used in [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] by professional [[digital artist]]s as a functional creative tool.

==Materials and tools==
The application offers a wide range of traditional artists' materials and tools. With the aid of a [[graphics tablet]] or computer mouse, the user is able to reproduce the effect of physical painting and drawing media such as watercolor, oil, chalk, charcoal and color pencil. There are also a few non-traditional items, such as the Image Hose, pattern pens, F/X, Distortion and Artist tools for allowing artists to apply less conventional elements on an image.

Painter emulates the visual characteristics of traditional media, such as oil paint, pastel sticks, air brush, charcoal, felt pens, and other traditional artists' materials on various textured surfaces. Many of these emulated media types work with the advanced features of Wacom tablets. For instance, the airbrush tool in Painter responds to pressure as well as tilt, velocity and rotation.

Painter and [[Photoshop]] have many similarities, such as layered editing. The two products have developed as contemporaries, introducing innovations that are now considered standard in bitmap image editing software. For example, "Floaters" were released with Painter 2.5, around the time that Photoshop released "composite elements". Over time, Painter's user interface has been transformed to match Photoshop's UI. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

==History==
Painter was initially developed{{when|date=July 2013}} for the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] system by [[Mark Zimmer]] and [[Tom Hedges]], founders of the [[Fractal Design Corporation]]. Zimmer and Hedges had previously developed ImageStudio and ColorStudio, both image-editing applications, for [[Letraset]]. John Derry joined Zimmer and Hedges during the release cycle of Painter 1.2. Derry had gained previous paint software expertise at Time Arts, a developer of the early desktop-based paint applications Lumena and Oasis. ''Fractal Design'' later merged with [[RayDream]], then with [[MetaTools]] to become [[MetaCreations]].  Metacreations sold off{{when|date=July 2013}} all their creative interests and Painter was acquired by [[Corel|Corel Corporation]] where it was temporarily rebranded "Procreate" Painter during its transition into the Corel Suite of graphic applications. Painter is now wholly owned and marketed by Corel.

==Painter Series==
At one point Painter had three companion applications: a vector-based natural media twin called [[Creature House Expression|Expression]]; a scaled-down version of Painter developed for beginners called [[Dabbler]] (later renamed Art Dabbler after the MetaCreations merger); and a grayscale-only clone called [[Sketcher (software)|Sketcher]].  After the Corel acquisition, Art Dabbler 2 was reintroduced as [[Corel Painter Essentials]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Product/1152105062012 |title=Corel product info}}&lt;/ref&gt; now in its fourth incarnation.

In 2007 Corel released version Painter X, which was at first available in a limited edition paint can, a nod to the packaging for early releases of the software.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Product/1170111321164 | title=Corel Painter X - Limited Edition Paint Can | accessdate=2007-07-13 | author = Corel Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painter Essentials===
{{Main| Corel Painter Essentials}}
Corel Painter Essentials is a less complex version of Painter designed for casual users. Multimedia tutorials, a more intuitive workspace, additional automated tasks and emphasis on photo retouching are some of the features included to appeal to beginners. Painter and Painter Essentials share much of the same underlying [[source code|code]], and have many of the same tools and functions. For professional artists Essentials will offer fewer tools and variants, and considerably less control.

===Painter Sketch Pad===
[[Corel Painter Sketch Pad]], launched in January 2009, is the newest member of the Painter product series. Sketch Pad focuses on the conception and early design phase of image creation. It has 13 drawing tools compared to Painter's almost 900 brushes, and a simple user interface that supports quick capturing of creative ideas. It is designed to work with a pen and drawing tablet.

==Reception==
As of 2017, Corel Painter continues to dominate its niche. In 2014, PC World called Painter "the best natural-media painting program out there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corel Painter 2015 review: Digital art studio betters its best features|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/2464183/corel-painter-2015-review-digital-art-studio-betters-its-best-features.html|accessdate=8 December 2017|work=PCWorld|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, PC Magazine called it "The best software at simulating painting and working with artistic media".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corel Painter 2016|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2494909,00.asp|accessdate=8 December 2017|work=PCMAG|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, ZDNet said it "remains one of the best digital painting tools for anyone with the skill to use traditional painting techniques onscreen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corel Painter 2018, First Take: The state of the natural-media art Review|url=http://www.zdnet.com/product/corel-painter-2018/|accessdate=8 December 2017|work=ZDNet|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''defensive attribution hypothesis''' (or ''bias'', ''theory'', or simply '''''defensive attribution''''') is a [[social psychology|social psychological]] term from the [[Attribution (psychology)|attributional approach]] referring to a set of beliefs used as a shield against the fear that one will be the [[Victimology|victim]] or cause of a serious mishap.

Commonly, defensive attributions are made when someone witnesses or learns of mishaps involving other people. These attributions of blame will depend upon any similarities between the witness and the person(s) involved in the mishap. More responsibility will be attributed as personal or situational [[Similarity (psychology)#Social psychological approaches|similarity]] decreases. Assigning responsibility allows the observer to believe that the mishap was controllable and thus preventable.&lt;ref name="walster"/&gt;

A defensive attribution may also be used to protect the person's [[self-esteem]] if, despite everything, the mishap does occur, because blame can be assigned to the "other" (person or situation).&lt;ref name="shaver"/&gt; The use of defensive attributions is considered a [[cognitive bias]] because an individual will change their beliefs about a situation based upon their [[motivation]]s or desires rather than the factual characteristics of the situation.&lt;ref name="shaver" /&gt;{{rp|112}}

==Research==
Walster (1966) hypothesized that it can be frightening to believe that a misfortune could happen to anyone at random, and attributing responsibility to the person(s) involved helps to manage this emotional reaction.&lt;ref name="walster" /&gt;

Shaver (1970) recognized that the similarity of the witness to the person(s) involved in the misfortune – in terms of situation, age, gender, personality, etc. – changes the amount of blame one is ready to ascribe. This is related to the [[empathy]] response, which is more likely to be activated if the witness sees similarities between themselves and the person(s) involved. Shaver was able to demonstrate this response by describing events to test subjects; varying the situations and people described to either match or be significantly different from the subjects: as similarity with witnesses increased, attributions of responsibility decreased.&lt;ref name="shaver"/&gt;

In 1981 Jerry Burger published a [[meta-analysis]] of 22 [[peer-reviewed]] studies on the defensive attribution hypothesis, in which he found strong evidence to support Shaver's hypothesized negative relationship between similarity and responsibility.&lt;ref name=Burger1981/&gt;

==Sexual assault==
Researchers examining [[sexual assault]] have consistently found that male participants blamed rapists less than female participants did, and that male participants blamed the rape victims more than female participants did.&lt;ref name=Grubb2008/&gt; These findings support Shaver's similarity-responsibility hypothesis: male participants, who are personally similar to (male) rapists, blame rapists less than female participants who are dissimilar to rapists. On the other hand, female participants, who are personally similar to (female) rape victims, blame the victims less than male participants.

[[File:Estampe-p1000686.jpg|250px|thumb|right|To think good thoughts requires effort. This is one of the things that discipline – [[training]] – is about.]]

'''Discipline''' is [[Action (philosophy)|action]] or inaction that is [[regulation |regulated]]  to be in accordance (or to achieve accord) with a particular system of [[governance]]. Discipline is commonly applied to regulating human and [[animal behavior]], and furthermore, it is applied to each activity-branch in all branches of organized activity, knowledge, and other fields of study and observation. Discipline can be a set of expectations that are required by any governing entity including the self, groups, classes, fields, industries, or [[society |societies]].

====Use of the word discipline====

Children being educated to use [[Waste_container |public litter bins]] is a form of disciplinary education that is expected by some societies. If a child cannot use a litter bin the lack of discipline can result in a reaction from observant people in public. Many people observe a form of disciplinary effort in their daily lives. Discipline has a very important role in student's life.


Discipline is a moral obligation among many groups of people. Disciplined behavior is required by some laws and other legal obligations. Commercial entities can also put in place strict disciplinary requirements for the length of the commercial agreement. Airlines enforce strict disciplinary and conduct rules upon [[Unruly_aircraft_passenger |flight passengers]]. 

In the [[Military_justice#Trial and appeals| military]], discipline regards the efforts made by superiors to punish the serviceperson. In academia, discipline can also regard the educators' responses and efforts that are designed to punish the student(s). Not only in military, in every parts of life of an individual discipline plays the most important role. Discipline shows the actual face of an individual. In animal husbandry and training, the animals may be disciplined to perform specific task and activities without errors. Additionally, animals can discipline their young through numerous methods; including nips, bites, and grips.

==History==
Disciplinarians have been involved in many societies throughout history. The Victorian era resulted in the popular use of disciplinarian governance over children. [[Edward VIII]] had a disciplinarian father, and the English had modelled the royal families during this era. Edward's grandmother was [[Queen Victoria]] who had championed the role of the family unit during her reign. A disciplinarian will enforce a stricter set of rules that are aimed at developing children according to theories of order and discipline. Disciplinarians have also been linked to child abuse in numerous cases and biographies.

==Common Techniques==
*[[Time management]] is a form of discipline that utilizes time as the regulator and the observer of time as the governor. The requirement is for time to be used efficiently. This activity maximizes the result of a set of activities by marking each activity within a boundary of time. Time management can utilize skills, tools, or techniques to create specific time allotments according to a range of organization methods. A major theme arising from time management is that of modifying behavior to ensure compliance with time-related deadlines. This theme is interrelated with discipline and methods of discipline that can be used without punitive consequences.

*Responsibility-based discipline co-opts the participants to understand remedies for problems in an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grote |first=Dick |date=2006 |title=The Birth of Discipline Without Punishment |publisher=American Management Association International |page=5 |isbn=9780814473306}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Corporal punishment|Physical punishment]] is a widely debated technique of discipline that can focus on [[spanking]], [[Slapping (strike)|slapping]], and hitting with an object using mild to extreme degrees of force. The general aim is to instil an understanding of consequence in the subject. Punishment can be used to instil immediate compliance as it acts as a reminder to the offender that there are consequences to their actions, especially when it comes to breaking the law.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2007}}
'''Disembowelment''' or '''evisceration''' is the removal of some or all of the [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] (the [[bowels]], or viscera), usually through a horizontal incision made across the [[Abdomen|abdominal]] area.  Disembowelment may result from an accident but has also been used as a method of [[torture]] and [[execution]].  In such practices, disembowelment may be accompanied by other forms of torture, or the removal of other vital organs.

==Disembowelment as torture==
If a living creature is disemboweled, it is invariably fatal without major medical intervention.  Historically, disembowelment has been used as a severe form of [[capital punishment]].  If the intestinal tract alone is removed, death follows after several hours of gruesome pain. The victim will often be fully conscious while the torture is performed if the vital organs aren't damaged, and will be able to see their intestine being removed, but will eventually lose consciousness due to blood loss. However, in some forms of intentional disembowelment, decapitation or the removal of the [[heart]] and [[lung]]s would hasten the victim's death.

[[File:Seppuku-2.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ukiyo-e]]'' woodblock print of warrior about to perform ''[[seppuku]]'', from the [[Edo period]].]]

====Japan====
In [[Japan]], disembowelment played a central part as a method of execution or the ritualized [[suicide]] of a [[samurai]]. In killing themselves by this method, they were deemed to be free from the dishonor resulting from their crimes. The most common form of disembowelment was referred to in Japanese as ''[[seppuku]]'' (or, colloquially, ''hara-kiri''), literally "stomach cutting," involving two cuts across the abdomen, sometimes followed by pulling out one's own [[Viscus|viscera]]. The act of [[decapitation]] by a second (''kaishaku-nin'') was added to this ritual suicide in later times in order to shorten the suffering of the samurai or leader, an attempt at rendering the ritual more humane. Even later the knife was just a simple formality and the swordsman would decapitate before the subject could reach for it.  The commission of a crime or dishonorable act was only one of many reasons for the performance of seppuku; others included the atonement of cowardice, as a means of apology, or following the loss of a battle or the surrender of a [[Japanese castle|castle]].

====Vietnam====
Various accounts have asserted that during the [[Vietnam War]], members of the [[Viet Cong]] sometimes made calculated use of disembowelment as a means of [[psychological warfare]], to coerce and intimidate rural [[peasant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hubbel |first=John G. |title=The Blood-Red Hands of Ho Chi Minh |journal=Readers Digest |date= November 1968  |pages=61–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Off With Their Hands |journal=Newsweek |date=15 May 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peer De Silva, former head of the [[Saigon]] department of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), wrote that from as early as 1963, Viet Cong units were using disembowelment and other methods of mutilation as psychological warfare.&lt;ref name=desilva&gt;{{cite book |last=De Silva |first=Peer |title=Sub Rosa: The CIA and the Uses of Intelligence |year=1978 |publisher=Time Books |place=New York |isbn=0-8129-0745-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent, however, to which this punishment was perpetrated may be impossible to gauge and while detailed accounts survive regarding how civilians were disemboweled by Viet Cong, the use of this torture appears to have been quite arbitrary and there is no record that such actions were sanctioned by the [[North Vietnam]]ese government in [[Hanoi]]. Disembowelment and other methods of intimidation and torture were intended to frighten civilian peasants at a local level into cooperating with the Viet Cong or discourage them from cooperating with the [[South Vietnamese Army]] or its allies.&lt;ref name=desilva/&gt;

===Europe===

====Romania====
In early 1941, during the [[Legionnaires%27 rebellion and Bucharest pogrom#The Bucharest pogrom|Bucharest pogrom]] in which 125 [[Jewish]] civilians were killed, multiple cases of torture including disembowelment were recorded.&lt;ref name="Ancel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ancel|first=Jean|title=History of the Holocaust – Romania |year=2002|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|location=[[Israel]]|isbn=965-308-157-8|language=he}} For details of the Pogrom itself, see volume I, pp. 363–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
On 10 July 1584, [[Balthasar Gérard]] shot and killed [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], who had advocated for [[Spanish Netherlands|Dutch independence]] from the [[Philip II of Spain|King of Spain]].&lt;ref name=jardine&gt;{{Cite book| author= [[Lisa Jardine|Jardine, Lisa]] |title= The Awful End of William the Silent: The First Assassination of A Head of State With A Handgun |place= London |publisher= HarperCollins |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-00-719257-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The assassin was interrogated and condemned to death almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Motley|first=John L.|title=The Rise of the Dutch Republic, Vol. 3|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4836|authorlink=John Lothrop Motley|year=1856}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July, after suffering various tortures during each of the five days since the assassination, Gérard was disemboweled and [[dismembered]] while still alive, after which his heart was torn out and then he was beheaded by his Dutch executioners.&lt;ref name=jardine/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] |first =Michel |title=[[Discipline and Punish]] |chapter = The Spectacle of the scaffold. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roman Empire====
[[Christian]] tradition states that [[Erasmus of Formiae]], also known as Saint Elmo, was finally executed by disembowelment in about A.D. 303, after he had suffered extreme forms of torture during the persecutions of Emperor [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]].

====England====
[[File:BNMsFr2643FroissartFol97vExecHughDespenser.jpg|thumb|The execution of [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], who was hanged, drawn and quartered for high treason in 1326]]
In [[England]], the punishment of being "[[hanged, drawn and quartered]]" was typically used for men convicted of [[high treason]]. This referred to the practice of dragging a man by a hurdle (similar to a fence) through the streets, removing him from the hurdle and (1) hanging him from the neck (but removing him before [[death]]), (2) drawing (i.e. disembowelling) him slowly on a wooden block by slitting open his abdomen, removing his [[entrail]]s and his other organs (which were frequently thrown on a fire), and then [[decapitation|decapitating]] him and (3) quartering, i.e. dividing the body into four pieces.  The man's head and quarters would often be [[parboiled]] and displayed as a [[Deterrence (legal)|warning]] to others. As part of the disembowelment, the man was also typically [[emasculation|emasculated]] and his genitals and entrails would be burned.

[[William Harrington (priest)|William Harrington]] is an example of someone tortured on the rack, [[Hanging|hanged]] until not quite dead, then subjected to disembowelment.&lt;ref name="Schama"&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Schama |title=Simon Schama's John Donne |date=26 May 2009 |publisher=BBC2 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo |accessdate=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
From the 15th century, ordinances are retained that threaten with a terrible punishment for those who stripped off the bark of a standing tree in the common woods. A typical wording is found in the 1401 ordinance from [[Oberursel (Taunus)|Oberursel]]:&lt;ref&gt;For a number of such ordinances, see * {{cite book|last=Grimm|first=Jacob|title=Deutsche Rechtsalterthümer

{{quote|"and whoever is caught stripping off a standing tree, mercy would have been more beneficial to him than the law is; for when law is to be fulfilled, then one is to cut up his stomach at the navel, and pull out a length of the gut. The gut is to be nailed to the tree, and one is keep going around that tree with the person, so long as he still has any part of the gut left in his body"}}
[[Jacob Grimm]] observes that no case of the punishment being carried out has been found in records from that period (15th century), but 300 to 500 years earlier, the [[West Slavs|Western Slavic]] tribes like the [[Wends]]  are said to have revenged themselves upon Christians by binding the guts to an erect pole and driving them around until the person was fully eviscerated.&lt;ref&gt;'''i)''' General comment, with connotations of this being a type of human sacrifice {{cite book|last=Hübner|first=Johann|title=Kurtze Fragen aus der politischen Historia, volume 6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9t4GAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA500|page=500|year=1703|publisher=Gleditsch|location=|accessdate=2013-03-13}}, '''ii)''' 8th century description from 772-73, {{cite book|last=Caesar|first=Aquilin Julius|title=Beschreibung des Herzogthum Steyermarks, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4wAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA88|pages=88–89|year=1786|publisher=Zaunrith|location=Gräz|accessdate=2013-03-13}},  '''iii)''' Danish 1096 retaliation on Wends, by like execution method, {{cite book|last=Sell|first=Johann Jakob|title=Geschichte des Herzogthums Pommern, volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQcBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA88|pages=88–89|year=1819|publisher=Flittner|location=Berlin|accessdate=2013-03-13}}, '''iv)''' 1131 pagan attacks on Christians by Wends, {{cite book|last=Röper|first=Friedrich L.|title=Geschichte und Anekdoten von Dobberan in Mecklenburg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f30AAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA111|pages=111–13|year=1808|publisher=Self-published|location=Dobberan|accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, members of the now extinct Baltic ethnic group of [[Old Prussians]] in one of the battles against the [[Teutonic Knights]], are said to have captured one such knight in 1248, and made to undergo this punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Voigt|first=Johannes|title=Geschichte Preussens: Von den altesten Zeiten bis zum Untergange der Herrschaft des Deutschen Ordens.

==Suicide==
The Japanese tradition of ''seppuku'' is a well known example of highly ritualized suicide, within a wider cultural world of norms and symbolism. However, reported examples of suicides exist, in which a person performed disembowelment on himself or herself, without any ambient culture of approved, or expected, suicide.

The Spartan king [[Cleomenes I]]  is reported, in a fit of madness, to have slit his stomach open, and ripped his own bowels out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lauremberg|first=Peter|title=Neue und vermehrte Acerra philologica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wcRCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA985|page=985|year=1708|publisher=Johann A. Plener|location=Frankfurt and Leipzig|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman statesman [[Cato the Younger]] committed suicide in [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], after [[Cato_the_Younger#The_Civil_War|his side]] lost to [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], by plunging a knife in his own gut, in the dead of night. According to [[Parallel Lives|Plutarch]], Cato's son heard the commotion from a nearby room, and called a doctor who stitched the wound close; after his son and the doctor left, Cato tore the stitching open with his hand and died. On account of his tragic, highly symbolic suicide, Cato is often termed ''Uticensis'' ("of Utica"), in order to differentiate him from his homonymous ancestor, [[Cato the Elder|Cato "the Elder" or "the Censor"]].

In 1593, a suicide occurred in [[Bad Wimpfen|Wimpfen]]. A young, pregnant woman, who had become a widow a few weeks before, was lying in her bed. She took a large knife, opened her belly in a cross, and threw out the fetus, her own intestines, and dug out her spleen and flung that out as well. She lived for 10 hours after the act, and when the priests sought to bring her a final consolation and blessing, she said it would all be in vain, because she was a daughter of the devil, and was beyond any sort of redemption. Then, she died, was put in a sack and thrown in the river. She was affluent, so it was clear that poverty had not driven her to this act.&lt;ref&gt;Forty years earlier, in 1555 Seidenberg (nowadays [[Zawidow]]), a woman who had become pregnant by another man than her (absent) husband sought to preserve her honour by cutting out the fetus. Having pulled it out, along with much else, she began screaming of pain, but no one could help her, and she died three days later. {{cite book|last=Döpler|first=Jacob|title=Theatrum Poenarum, volume 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LZlBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA313|pages=313–14|year=1697|publisher=Friedrich Lanckischen Erben|location=Leipzig|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1617, a merchant in the municipality Grossglockau&lt;ref&gt;For status as municipality, see:{{cite book|last=Janssen|first=Johannes|title=History of the German People at the Close of the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N509AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA336|page=336|year=1896|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; slit up his abdomen so that the intestines fell out; he then pulled out his stomach and threw it on the bed. The chronicler notes he lived long enough to regret his action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khevenhüller|first=Franz C.|title=Annales Ferdinandei, volume 7-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnFZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT138|page=column 1158|year=1723|publisher=M.G.

==Transanal evisceration==
When a portion of the intestinal tract is forcefully pulled from or expelled from the body through the anus, it is referred to as ''transanal evisceration''. Following the first report of transanal small intestine evisceration by Brodie in 1827, more than 70 cases have been reported to date, the majority occurring spontaneously in elderly individuals. Straining, chronic constipation, and rectal ulcerations predispose to spontaneous perforation in elderly individuals.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Medappil|first1=Noushif|title=Blunt abdominal trauma with transanal small bowel evisceration|journal=J Emerg Trauma Shock|date=Jan–Mar 2013|volume=6|issue=1|pages=56–57|doi=10.4103/0974-2700.106328|pmid=23493429|pmc=3589862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of transanal evisceration of children whilst sitting over uncovered [[swimming pool]] drains have been reported; notable cases include Valerie Lakey (1993) and [[Death of Abigail Taylor|Abigail Taylor]] (2007).  In Taylor's case, the suction dislodged and damaged her liver and pancreas; several meters of her small intestine were forcefully pulled through her anus.  In both these cases, the victims were left with [[short bowel syndrome]] and required feeding by total [[parenteral nutrition]]. After multiple operations, Taylor later died from transplant-related cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wsbtv.com/news/13626279/detail.html |title=Wading Pool Drain Sucks Out Girl's Organ |date=5 Jul 2007 |work=WSB Atlanta |accessdate=28 June 2011 |location=MINNEAPOLIS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629124327/http://www.wsbtv.com/news/13626279/detail.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/160648/ |title=Family Reaches Settlement that Guarantees $25 Million Payment |date=January 14, 1997 |work=[[WRAL-TV]] |accessdate=29 October 2010 |location=RALEIGH}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A person, usually a child, can suffer a similar injury if a heavy weight is applied directly over the abdomen. Large intestine (Rectosigmoid) rupture with transanal evisceration has been reported from blunt abdominal trauma and suction injuries. A direct blow or impingement of intestine between the vertebrae and anterior abdominal wall results in sudden increase in the intra-abdominal or intraluminal pressure of the intestine and rupture.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; The downward pressure forces a portion of the intestine to burst from the anus.

===Cultural references===
The short story "[[Haunted (Palahniuk novel)#"Guts"|Guts]]" from the book ''[[Haunted (Palahniuk novel)|Haunted]]'' by [[Chuck Palahniuk]] is based on the concept of transanal evisceration.

In Japanese folklore, it was believed that malicious ''[[Kappa (folklore)|Kappa]]''{{spaced ndash}}water-goblins that inhabited ponds and rivers{{spaced ndash}}might thrust a hand into the anus of a human swimmer, seeking a mythical sphere called a ''shirikodama''.

In American Horror Story: Roanoke (2016), Cricket is disemboweled by The Butcher (Thomyson White)

In the video game [[Fallout: New Vegas]], if the character Arcade Gannon is sold into slavery, during the ending slideshow he narrates how, during an unguarded moment, he used a [[Scalpel|medical scalpel]] to disembowel himself.

==Embalming==
The process of [[embalming]] sometimes includes removing the internal organs. [[Mummy|Mummification]], especially as practised by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, entailed the removal of the internal organs prior to the preservation of the remainder of the body.  The organs removed were embalmed, stored in [[canopic jars]] and then placed in the tomb with the body.

James Cook, on his second voyage, noted an embalming custom on some of the Pacific islands his crew visited, a custom utilizing transanal evisceration:&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|last=Potts|first=James|title=The Hibernian Magazine, Or, Compendium of Entertaining Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbkRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA693|year=1784|publisher=James Potts|location=Dublin|page=693, col 2|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|We found the body not only entire in every part; but, what surprised us much more, was, that putrefaction had scarcely begun (...); though the climate is one of the hottest, and Tee had been dead above five months.(...) Such were Mr. [[William Anderson (naturalist)|Anderson]]'s remarks to me, who also told me, on his enquiring inte the method of effecting this preservation of their dead bodies, he had been informed, that, soon after their death, they are disemboweled, by drawing their intestines, and other viscera, out at the anus; and the whole cavity is then filled or stuffed with cloth; introduced through the same part(...)}}

''' Divya-drishti ''' ([[Hindi]]: दिव्य दृष्टि) or the divine eye-sight, also known as ''Yoga-drishti'', refers to 'divine perception' which is intuitive perception or cognition that carries with it an intrinsic certainty and conviction.

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]], [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]]:-

: न तु मां शक्यसे द्रष्टुमनेनैव स्वचक्षुषा |
: दिव्यं ददामि ते चक्षुः पश्य मे योगमैश्वरम् || 

: " But surely you cannot see Me with these human eyes of yours; therefore; I vouchsafe to you the divine eye. With this you behold My divine power of Yoga. "  - ([[Bhagavad Gita]] XI.8)

Krishna invited Arjuna to observe the Cosmic Body or [[Viraj]]) and behold as concentrated within that body (in the person of Krishna) the entire creation and all that is desired to be seen. When Arjuna failed to see that divine form, Krishna bestowed the gift of divine vision – दिव्यं चक्षुः. Thus endowed, Arjuna saw an undisguised reality he could otherwise not see, what he then saw was अद्भुतदर्शनम् (many a wonderful sight) divine in essence, transcendent and all-effulgent, the sight which has never been seen before. Arjuna saw the power of creating diversity in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yoga of Devotion|author=GK Marballi|publisher=Lulu|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_LwBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=divya-drishti&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6rztVOf4AoHjuQTv9oHgBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=divya-drishti&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar gift had been bestowed on [[Sanjaya]] by Sage [[Vyasa]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadgita Tattvavivecani|author=Jayadayal Goyandka|publisher=Gita Press|pages=488-490|url= https://books.google.com/books/about/Srimadbhagavadgita.html?id=NFWHMwEACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Vedic|Vedic seers]] have spoken about the wondrous eyes of Lord [[Vishnu]], the ever-open watchful divine eyes whose power of sight is not restricted by space and time. Rishi Medhātithih Kānvah states that:-

: तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं सदा पश्यन्ति सूरयः |
: दिवीव चक्षुराततम् || - ([[Rig Veda]] I.xxii.20)

: " the learned practitioners of Dharma do, in the brightness of the (all-revealing) sun, (clearly) see the wide spread eyes of the Lord, the mighty all-surveying Sole Witness, and in the process with the aid of knowledge also see Him at all times ensconced as the atman.

The FPS response can be elicited in the face of any threatening stimulus (e.g., any object, person or situation that would cause someone to experience feelings of fear), but it can also be elicited by a neutral stimulus as a result of [[fear conditioning]], a process that occurs when a benign stimulus comes to evoke [[fear]] and [[anxiety]] upon being paired with a traumatic or fear-provoking event. The stimulus in question is usually of auditory (e.g., loud noise) or visual (e.g., bright light) nature, and startle response measures include eyeblink rates and [[pulse]]/[[heart rate]].&lt;ref name="Grillon"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grillon, C. |author2= Davis, M. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Fear-potentiated startle conditioning in humans: Explicit and contextual cue conditioning following paired versus unpaired training |journal=Psychophysiology |volume=34 |pages=451–458|year=1997 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.1997.tb02389.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative impact of heightened FPS in the face of neutral stimuli can be treated pharmacologically, using psychotropic medications that are typically used to reduce [[anxiety]] in humans.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Davis, M. |author2=Falls, W.

==Neurobiology of FPS==

The central brain structure through which fear-associated responses are mediated has been determined to be the [[amygdala]], which is located in the brain’s [[temporal lobe]]. When the central nucleus of the amygdala is stimulated - what is popularly referred to as the “[[fight-or-flight]]” response is activated - the organism in question reacts passively (is rendered frozen in its tracks, becomes hyper-vigilantly attentive, etc.), or displays a physiological reaction geared toward facilitating an aggressive reaction (e.g., increased heart-rate/pulse, rapid breathing). These fear-induced reactions result from communication between the amygdala and a variety of other brain regions (such as the [[brain stem]] and [[hypothalamus]]), resulting in a variety of physiological responses in the organism. For instance, communication between an activated amygdala and the lateral hypothalamus results in increased [[blood pressure]] and dilation of the pupils; the initiation of the [[central grey]] via communication from the amygdala results in the organism's becoming frozen in its tracks; communication between the activated amygdala and the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus releases hormones associated with [[stress (biology)]].&lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lang, P. J. |author2=Davis, M. |author3= Ohman, A. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Fear and Anxiety: Animal Models and Human Cognitive Psychophysiology |journal=Journal of Affective Disorders |volume=61 |pages=137–159|year=2000 |doi=10.1016/s0165-0327(00)00343-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature has linked the FPS response to interplay between the central nucleus of the amgydala and both the central grey and nucleus reticular pontis caudalis. Insult (e.g., [[traumatic brain injury]]) to these brain areas inhibits any display of FPS response in humans. In addition, a distinction has been made concerning neural activity of the reflexive FPS response, and that which occurs in the face of exposure to a fear-inducing stimulus over a long period of time, such as [[abuse]] or [[combat]] or to a place or situation. Literature suggests that, in such situations, FPS is caused by activation of the bed nucleus of the stria terminals.&lt;ref name="V"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Vaidyanathan, U. |author2=Patrick, C.

==Measuring the Startle Response and Utilization of FPS Data==

The most common physiological response measured to gauge FPS response in humans is eyeblink, or the reflexive act of blinking. Currently, the most widely accepted/used means with which to measure the eyeblink reflex is by using a technology called electromyographic recording ([[Electromyography|EMG]]). EMG provides eyeblink rate data by measuring and recording activity of the eyelid muscles using two electrodes. In order to obtain an optimal reading, the person’s skin must be cleaned, dried, and covered with a thin layer of electrode gel in only the spots where the measures will be taken; one electrode is placed in the center of the person’s forehead above the nose, and two recording electrodes are placed directly underneath the eye, approximately two centimeters apart. The participant should be looking forward for the duration of data collection. If noises are used as the catalyst for the FPS response in a study (acoustic startle), the volume must be both controlled and reported, as noises around 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz can compromise the accuracy of the recordings taken by the EMG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Blumenthal, T. D. |author2=Cuthbert, B. N. |author3=Filion, D. L. |author4=Hackley, S. |author5=Lipp, O. V. |author6= Van Boxtel, A. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Committee report: Guidelines for Human Startle Eyeblink Electromyographic Studies |journal=Psychophysiology |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=1–15|year=2005 |pmid=15720576 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2005.00271.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically measuring FPS response in studies of fear is highly practical, as the experimental and baseline measures of an individual’s startle response can be partitioned, and [[variance]] in startle can, in turn, be attributed to fear (or lack thereof, in the case that extinction of fear is variable of interest), allowing illusory correlates (other variables that can also appear to cause an effect on our variable of interest) to be ruled out.&lt;ref name="Lang" /&gt; There are several experimental climates that can be used to examine the FPS response. Eyeblink FPS response is typically gauged by presenting participants with pleasant and unpleasant (as well as neutral) emotionally evocative stimuli, paired with a loud noise or a flash of bright lights. The presented stimuli can be replaced by having participants imagine emotionally evocative stimuli of pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral natures. FPS response is typically most exaggerated in response to emotionally unpleasant stimuli, followed by pleasant and then neutral stimuli, in members of the general population.&lt;ref name="V" /&gt;

In addition, FPS response in research concerning fear conditioning (and extinction of a conditioned aversion to a previously neutral stimulus) is also commonly examined; such studies will present noise or light startle probes with unpleasant stimuli to condition the FPS to occur in the presence of that stimuli. Measurements of FPS response in response to both the conditioned stimuli and the neutral stimuli (in the absence of light or sound probes) are then taken,&lt;ref name="V" /&gt; with the measured difference in the size of startle response being the variable of interest, as this difference score indicates alteration of naturally occurring and conditioned FPS response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Filion, D. L. |author2=Dawson, M. E. |author3= Schell, A. M. |last-author-amp=yes|title=The Psychological Significance of Human Startle Eyeblink Modification: A Review |journal=Biological Psychology |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=1–43|year=1998 |pmid=9505132 |doi=10.1016/s0301-0511(97)00020-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resulting data from such studies can be used to examine both FPS response in light of conditioned fear, and an individual’s ability to break the conditioned fear reactions (extinction).

==FPS and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder==

A heightened (or abnormally overactive) startle response in the face of benign stimuli/settings is often seen in individuals suffering from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pole, N. |author2=Neylan, T. C. |author3=Best, S. R. |author4=Orr, S. P. |author5= Marmar, C. R. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Fear-Potentiated Startle and Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms in Urban Police Officers |journal=[[Journal of Traumatic Stress]] |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=471–479|year=2003 |doi=10.1023/a:1025758411370}}&lt;/ref&gt; a psychological ailment characterized by maladaptive and inappropriate affective and physiological reactions to stimuli that can be associated with a previously experienced [[psychological trauma|trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=American Psychiatric Association |title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders |edition=4th |location=Washington, DC |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, combat veterans often experience psychological and physiological panic / anxiety / dissociative “[[flashback (psychology)|flashback]]s” to the traumatic experience that triggered the PTSD pathology in reaction to unexpected loud noises, a stimulus that can remind the individual of gunshots, bombs, or exploding grenades.

Individuals with PTSD have been shown to have an increased FPS response,&lt;ref name="J"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jovanovic, T. |author2=Norrholm, S. D. |author3=Blanding, N. Q. |author4=Phifer, J. E. |author5=Weiss, T. |author6=Davis, M. |author7=Duncan, E. |author8=Bradley, B. |author9= Ressler, K. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Fear Potentiation is Associated With Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Function in PTSD |journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology |volume=35 |issue=6 |pages=846–857|year=2010 |doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2009.11.009|pmc=2875386 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and data have also suggested that this response becomes further exaggerated when these individuals experience [[Stress (biology)|stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Grillon, C. |author2= Morgan, C. A. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Fear-Potentiated Startle Conditioning to Explicit and Contextual Cues in Gulf War Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. |journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology |volume=108 |pages=134–142|year=1999 |doi=10.1037/0021-843x.108.1.134}}&lt;/ref&gt; People having been diagnosed with PTSD display similar FPS response to threatening and neutral stimuli, indicating that (unlike those not suffering from PTSD) these individuals have difficulty distinguishing a stimulus as posing a threat or being benign.&lt;ref name="J" /&gt; Additionally, data has displayed a significantly reduced ability for the extinction of conditioned fear responses in combat Veterans with severe, chronic PTSD &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jovanovic, T. |author2=Norrholm, S. D. |author3=Fennell, J. E. |author4=Keyes, M. |author5=Fiallos, A. M. |author6=Myers, K. M. |author7=Davis, M. |author8= Duncan, E. J. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Posttraumatic Stress Disorder May Be Associated With Impaired Fear Inhibition: Relation to Symptom Severity |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research|volume=167 |issue=1–2 |pages=151–160|year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2007.12.014 |pmid=19345420 |pmc=2713500}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduced ability for fear extinction over longer periods of time in combat veterans, as a result of the pathology associated with PTSD, has also been asserted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Milad, M. R. |author2=Orr, S. P. |author3=Lasko, N. B. |author4=Chang, Y. |author5=Rauch, S. L. |author6= Pitman, R. K. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Presence and Acquired Origin of Reduced Recall for Fear Extinction in PTSD: Results of a Twin Study |journal=Journal of Psychiatric Research |volume=42 |issue=7 |pages=515–520|year=2008 |doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2008.01.017|pmc=2377011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heightened FPS response has also been implicated in the following disorders, falling under the current DSM-IV-TR classification of anxiety disorders: [[phobia]] (social and specific) and [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]]. On the converse, mood disorders such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] have been shown to cause weakened FPS responses in diagnosed individuals.&lt;ref name="V" /&gt;

==Treatment options==

As exaggerated FPS responses can lend to the pathology associated with PTSD and other disorders of the anxiety disorder classification, decreasing the startle response in humans may be of benefit in the treatment of these psychological disorders. Several forms of medication acting on different neurotransmitters (e.g., [[GABA]], [[dopamine]]) in the brain have been shown to cause significant reductions in startle response; the medications that are effective in treating conditioned fear are those typically used in the treatment of anxiety.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9577">There is a criticism of the [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]].  The criticism stems from the fact that this measurement of [[Measures of national income and output|national product]] does not account for [[environmental degradation]] and [[resource depletion]].  A new approach to the situation of allocating these omitted environmental features in the [[Measures of national income and output|national product]] has been the advent of the '''green national product'''.

== Criticism of gross national product ==

The [[gross national product]] (GNP) measures the [[Welfare economics|welfare]] of a nation's economy through the aggregate of products and services produced in that nation.  Although GNP is a proficient measurement of the magnitude of the economy, many economists, environmentalists and citizens have been arguing the validity of the GNP in respect to measuring [[Welfare economics|welfare]].  [[Joseph Stiglitz]], [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize–winning economist]], states that this standard measurement for any [[national economy]] has become deficient as a measure of long-term economic health in our recently resource-driven and [[Globalization|globalizing]] world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/10/02/8387507/index.htm?postversion=2006092508 | title=Good Numbers Gone Bad | publisher=CNN | accessdate=2008-04-02 | date=2006-10-02 | first=Joseph | last=Stiglitz}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics suggest that GNP often includes the environment on the wrong side of the balance sheet because if someone first pollutes and then another person cleans the pollution, both activities add to GNP making environmental degradation frequently look good for the economy.&lt;ref name="Green Accounting"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwagner.com/research/green_accounting/index.html | title=Green Accounting | publisher=[[Gernot Wagner]] | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-04-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307223603/http://www.gwagner.com/research/green_accounting/index.html | archive-date=2008-03-07 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of [[mainstream economics]] complain that GNP compiles spending that makes us worse off, spending that allows us to stay in the same place, and spending that makes us better off all in a single measure, giving a nation no clue if they are making progress or not.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.2"&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", [[University Press of America]], c1994. p.2 "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Manfred Max-Neef]], Chilean economist, explains that politicians feel that it is irrelevant whether the spending is productive, unproductive, or destructive.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.2"/&gt;  In this sense, it is common to see political policies that call to depredate a natural resource in order to increase the GNP.  To take into account the environmental depredation and resource depletion, there is a call to shift away from the traditional GNP and construct an assessment of national product that takes into account environmental effects.

== History ==

=== Measure of economic welfare ===

Ever since the Industrial Revolution, scientists and economists have warned of an [[inflection point]] for the United States economy where expansion is inevitably limited by the steadily decreasing availability of natural resources.  In 1973, [[William D. Nordhaus]] and [[James Tobin]], [[Yale University|Yale]] economists, were the first to question the GNP in "is growth obsolete?"  Nordhaus and Tobin developed a [[Measure of Economic Welfare]] (MEW) and stated that welfare must be sustainable, in the sense that nations that devour their stock of capital are not as "well" as the national income would suggest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cowles.econ.yale.edu/P/cp/p03b/p0398a.pdf |format = pdf |  title=Is Growth Obsolete? | publisher=Milton Moss | year=1973 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Index of sustainable economic welfare ===

However, in "The Green National Product", Clifford Cobb and John Cobb argue that the Measure of Economic Welfare failed to encompass the depletion of [[natural capital]].&lt;ref&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.10-11 "How to Measure Welfare: Some Options"&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1989, [[Herman Daly]], John Cobb, and Clifford Cobb created what is known as the [[Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare]] (ISEW).  This new measurement of welfare was created in the hopes that it would replace the flawed GNP.  Herman Daly stated that the key flaw of the traditional GNP was that it ignored core accounting principles of business where all revenues and expenses are allocated to income.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | title=Fixing GDP: Green Accounting in the United States | publisher=National Public Radio | date=April 9, 2004 | accessdate=2008-04-02 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402233502/http://www.gwagner.com/writing/2004/04/fixing-gdp-green-accounting-in-united.html | archive-date=2008-04-02 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ISEW called for ecological and economic sustainability to coincide since the economy is ultimately dependent on the natural resources that the earth provides.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.280"&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.280 "Bridging Economics and Ecology"&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than the original GNP, ISEW takes into account costs that are naturally unsustainable.  By creating ISEW, they wanted to expand the current national product so that individuals, businesses, and governments could take actions that will generally enhance welfare, rather than merely enhancing the traditional GNP.&lt;ref&gt;Cobb Clifford, and Cobb, John. "The Green National Product", University Press of America, c1994. p.280-281 "Bridging Economics and Ecology"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genuine progress indicator ===

In 1995, Redefining Progress created the [[genuine progress indicator]] (GPI) as an alternative to the traditional GNP.  This new measurement of national income would allow policymakers to gauge how well citizens are, economically and socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rprogress.org/sustainability_indicators/genuine_progress_indicator.htm | title=Genuine Progress Indicator | publisher=Redifining Progress | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike welfare adjustments in the past like MEW and ISEW, GPI adjusts not only for environmental depredation, but also for income distribution, housework, volunteering, crime, changes in leisure time, and life-span of consumer durables and public infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rprogress.org/sustainability_indicators/genuine_progress_indicator.htm | title=Genuine Progress Indicator | publisher=Redefining Progress | year=2008 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was one of the first alternatives to the traditional GNP to be used by the scientific community and governmental organizations globally.

=== In the United States ===

In 1992, the [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] (BEA) of the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]] initiated intensive work to create an environmental accounting system.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://rcted.ncu.edu.tw/speech/On%20Green%20NP%202007%201117[1].pdf |format = pdf |  title=On "Green National Product": Theories and a Comparison Among Difference Approaches | publisher=Eolss Publishers | year=2007 | accessdate=2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The BEA began by creating satellite accounts with easily measurable commodities such as petroleum and coal.  The first BEA publication was the U.S. Integrated Environmental and Economic Satellite Accounts (IEESA) in 1994.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"/&gt;  The initial results were quite significant, and showed how GNP was overestimating the impact of mining industries in respect to the nations economic wealth.&lt;ref name="National Public Radio"/&gt;  Mining companies didn't care for the initial publications, for obvious reasons, and soon [[Alan Mollohan]], a Democratic House Representative from [[West Virginia]]'s coal country, sponsored an amendment to the 1995 [[Appropriation Bill]].  In response, Congress directed the BEA to suspend further work in [[Sustainability measurement|environmental accounting]], and to obtain an external review on their findings.&lt;ref name="Eolss Publishers"/&gt;

== Need ==

Many people are calling for a green national product that would indicate if activities benefit or harm the economy and well-being.  This green national product would revolve around the social and economic issues on which many green movements have focused: care for the earth and all that sustain it.&lt;ref name="Green Accounting"/&gt;  This new national product would differ from the traditional GNP by addressing both the sustainability and well-being of the planet and its inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Cobb Clifford p.280"/&gt;  It is essential that this system takes into account natural capital, which is currently hidden from our traditional measurement.

The '''''Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary''''' ('''''HTOED''''') is the print edition of the largest [[thesaurus]] in the world, the '''''Historical Thesaurus of English''''' ('''''HTE'''''), conceived and compiled by the English Language Department of the [[University of Glasgow]]. The ''HTE'' is a complete database of all the words in the second edition of [[Oxford English Dictionary|''The Oxford English Dictionary'']], arranged by [[semantic field]] and date. In this way, the ''HTE'' arranges the whole vocabulary of [[English language|English]], from the earliest written records in [[Old English language|Old English]] to the present, alongside types and dates of use. It is the first historical thesaurus to be compiled for any of the world's languages and contains 800,000 meanings for 600,000 words, within 230,000 categories, covering more than 920,000 words and meanings.&lt;ref name="Woolcock"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article6644646.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Nicola | last=Woolcock | title=After a 44-year labour of love worlds biggest thesaurus is born | date=2009-07-06}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hitchings|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Hitchings|title=Historical Thesaurus is a masterpiece worth waiting 40 years for|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/6413166/Historical-Thesaurus-is-a-masterpiece-worth-waiting-40-years-for.html|accessdate=25 October 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|date=23 October 2009|ref=Hitchings-2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the ''HTE'' website states, "in addition to providing hitherto unavailable information for linguistic and textual scholars, the ''Historical Thesaurus'' online is a rich resource for students of social and cultural history, showing how concepts developed through the words that refer to them."&lt;ref name="hte"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historicalthesaurus.arts.gla.ac.uk/ |title=Home page |website=The Historical Thesaurus of English |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ambitious project was announced at a 1965 meeting of the [[Philological Society]] by its originator, [[Michael Samuels (academic)|Michael Samuels]].&lt;ref name=Crystal-2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crystal|first1=David|authorlink1=David Crystal|title=Words in Time and Place: Exploring Language Through the ''Historical Thesaurus of the Oxford English Dictionary''|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199680477|page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work on the ''HTE'' started in 1965.

On 22 October 2009, after 44 years of work, version 1.0 was published as a two-volume set as ''HTOED''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/8136122.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; England &amp;#124; Oxfordshire &amp;#124; Forty-year wait for new thesaurus |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-07-06 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of two slipcased hardcover volumes, totaling nearly 4,000 pages. The ''HTE'', released as version 4.2 in September 2014, is freely available online from the University of Glasgow.&lt;ref name="hte-versions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historicalthesaurus.arts.gla.ac.uk/versions-and-changes/ |title=Versions of the Thesaurus |website=The Historical Thesaurus of English |publisher=University of Glasgow |accessdate=2014-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main sections==
The work is divided into three main sections: the External World, the Mind, and Society. These are broken down into successively narrower domains. The text eventually discriminates more than 236,000 categories.

==Synopsis==

The report is believed to be the first comparative international analysis of the human rights of intersex people.&lt;ref name="oii-au" /&gt; It found that intersex people are discriminated against worldwide.&lt;ref name="epd" /&gt;

Ghattas states:
{{quotation|Intersex individuals are considered individuals with a «disorder» in all areas in which Western medicine prevails. They are more or less obviously treated as sick or «abnormal», depending on the respective society.}}

Ghattas found that:&lt;ref name="oii-au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oii.org.au/24360/human-rights-between-the-sexes-a-study/|title=Human rights between the sexes, a study|work=oii.org.au|publisher=[[Organisation Intersex International Australia]]|date=11 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3sat.de/page/?source=/nano/medizin/173068/index.html|language=de|title=Nicht Mann, niche Frau. Intersexuelle müssen sich nicht mehr festlegen|work=3sat.de|publisher=[[3sat]]|date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Genital "normalization" surgeries are widespread: "Nearly all over the world, intersex bodies are considered to be barely, or not at all, capable of being integrated into the social order. Therefore, genital surgery is performed from infancy to adolescence and adulthood in all examined countries."
*Gonadal tissue is removed in most countries, between childhood and adolescence. Hormone treatments are administered.
*There is minimal aftercare.
*Birth registrations, with a sex assignment, is required in most countries, within 4 weeks of birth.
*Intersex is treated as a taboo subject in all countries studied. Intersex people experience prejudice, often due to gender non-conforming behaviour and appearance.
*Human rights-based activism is only recently established, and the number of NGOs small and volunteer-based.

{{quotation|Nearly all over the world, intersex bodies are considered to be barely, or not at all, capable of being integrated into the social order.}}

Ghattas makes five conclusions for human rights organisations:
#Raise awareness of the existence of intersex individuals.
#Increase visibility of intersex individuals and life situations.
#Encourage intersex people to self-organise and voice needs.
#Promote collaboration with NGOs.
#Take account of the needs of intersex people in all areas of human rights work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12783">{{Redirect|Predicativism|the other school of philosophy, also known as predicativism|Ultrafinitism}}
Something that is '''impredicative''', in [[mathematics]], [[logic]] and [[philosophy of mathematics]], is a [[self reference|self-referencing]] [[definition]]. Roughly speaking, a definition is impredicative if it invokes (mentions or quantifies over) the set being defined, or (more commonly) another set that contains the thing being defined. There is no generally accepted precise definition of what it means to be predicative or impredicative. Authors have given different but related definitions.

The opposite of impredicativity is predicativity, which essentially entails building [[Stratification (mathematics)|stratified]] (or ramified) theories where quantification over lower levels results in variables of some new type, distinguished from the lower types that the variable ranges over. A prototypical example is [[intuitionistic type theory]], which retains ramification so as to discard impredicativity.

[[Russell's paradox]] is a famous example of an impredicative construction—namely the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. The [[paradox]] is that such a set cannot exist: If it would exist, the question could be  asked whether it contains itself or not — if it does then by definition it should not, and if it does not then by definition it should.

The [[greatest lower bound]] of a set {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|glb({{var|X}})}}, also has an impredicative definition: {{math|1={{var|y}} = glb({{var|X}})}} if and only if for all elements {{math|{{var|x}}}} of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|{{var|y}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|x}}}}, and any {{math|{{var|z}}}} less than or equal to all elements of {{math|{{var|X}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|y}}}}. This definition quantifies over the set (potentially [[infinite set|infinite]], depending on the order in question) whose members are the lower bounds of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, one of which being the glb itself. Hence '''predicativism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; would reject this definition.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:42–43&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{quotebox|width=30%
|quote=Norms (containing one variable) which do not define classes I propose to call ''non-predicative'';
those which do define classes I shall call ''predicative''. 
|source={{harv|Russell|1907|loc=p.34}} (Russell used "norm" to mean a proposition: roughly something that can take the values "true" or "false".)
}}

The terms "predicative" and "impredicative" were introduced by {{harvtxt|Russell|1907}}, though the meaning has changed a little since then. 

[[Solomon Feferman]] provides a historical review of predicativity, connecting it to current outstanding research problems.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Feferman, "[https://math.stanford.edu/~feferman/papers/predicativity.pdf Predicativity]" (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vicious circle principle]] was suggested by [[Henri Poincaré]] (1905-6, 1908)&lt;ref&gt;dates derived from Kleene 1952:42&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]] in the wake of the paradoxes as a requirement on legitimate set specifications. Sets that do not meet the requirement are called ''impredicative''.

The first modern paradox appeared with [[Cesare Burali-Forti]]'s 1897 ''A question on transfinite numbers''&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort's commentary before Burali-Forti's (1897) ''A question on transfinite numbers'' in van Heijenoort 1967:104; see also his commentary before Georg Cantor's (1899) ''Letter to Dedekind'' in van Heijenoort 1967:113&lt;/ref&gt; and would become known as the [[Burali-Forti paradox]]. Cantor had apparently discovered the same paradox in his (Cantor's) "naive" set theory and this become known as [[Cantor's paradox]]. Russell's awareness of the problem originated in June 1901&lt;ref&gt;Commentary by van Heijenoort before Bertrand Russell's ''Lettern to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124&lt;/ref&gt; with his reading of [[Frege]]'s treatise of mathematical logic, his 1879 ''[[Begriffsschrift]]''; the offending sentence in Frege is the following:
{{quote|On the other hand, it may be also be that the argument is determinate and the function indeterminate.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege (1879) ''Begriffsschrift'' in van Heijenoort 1967:23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, given {{math|{{var|f}}({{var|a}})}} the function {{math|{{var|f}}}} is the variable and {{math|{{var|a}}}} is the invariant part. So why not substitute the value {{math|{{var|f}}({{var|a}})}} for {{math|{{var|f}}}} itself? Russell promptly wrote Frege a letter pointing out that:
{{quote|You state ... that a function too, can act as the indeterminate element. This I formerly believed, but now this view seems doubtful to me because of the following contradiction. Let {{math|{{var|w}}}} be the predicate: to be a predicate that cannot be predicated of itself. Can {{math|{{var|w}}}} be predicated of itself? From each answer its opposite follows. There we must conclude that {{math|{{var|w}}}} is not a predicate. Likewise, there is no class (as a totality) of those classes which each taken as a totality, do not belong to themselves. From this I conclude that under certain circumstances a definable collection does not form a totality.&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell's 1902 ''Letter to Frege'' in van Heijenoort 1967:124-125&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Frege promptly wrote back to Russell acknowledging the problem:
{{quote|Your discovery of the contradiction caused me the greatest surprise and, I would almost say, consternation, since it has shaken the basis on which I intended to build arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;Gottlob Frege's (1902) ''Letter to Russell'' in van Hiejenoort 1967:127&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While the problem had adverse personal consequences for both men (both had works at the printers that had to be emended), van Heijenoort observes that "The paradox shook the logicians' world, and the rumbles are still felt today. ... Russell's paradox, which uses the bare notions of set and element, falls squarely in the field of logic. The paradox was first published by Russell in ''The principles of mathematics'' (1903) and is discussed there in great detail ...".&lt;ref&gt;Van Heijenoort's commentary before Bertrand Russell's (1902) ''Letter to Frege'' 1967:124&lt;/ref&gt; Russell, after six years of false starts, would eventually answer the matter with his 1908 theory of types by "propounding his ''[[axiom of reducibility]]''. It says that any function is coextensive with what he calls a ''predicative'' function: a function in which the types of apparent variables run no higher than the types of the arguments".&lt;ref&gt;Willard V. Quine's commentary before Bertrand Russell's 1908 ''Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types''&lt;/ref&gt; But this "axiom" was met with resistance from all quarters.

The rejection of impredicatively defined mathematical objects (while accepting the [[natural number]]s as classically understood) leads to the position in the [[philosophy of mathematics]] known as predicativism, advocated by [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Hermann Weyl]] in his ''Das Kontinuum''. Poincaré and Weyl argued that impredicative definitions are problematic only when one or more underlying sets are infinite.

[[Ernst Zermelo]] in his 1908 "A new proof of the possibility of a well-ordering"{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}} presents an entire section "b. ''Objection concerning nonpredicative definition''" where he argued against "Poincaré (1906, p.&amp;nbsp;307) [who states that] a definition is 'predicative' and logically admissible only if it ''excludes'' all objects that are dependent upon the notion defined, that is, that can in any way be determined by it".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190&lt;/ref&gt; He gives two examples of impredicative definitions &amp;ndash; (i) the notion of [[Dedekind chain]]s and (ii) "in analysis wherever the maximum or minimum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers {{math|{{var|Z}}}} is used for further inferences. This happens, for example, in the well-known Cauchy proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra, and up to now it has not occurred to anyone to regard this as something illogical".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:190–191&lt;/ref&gt; He ends his section with the following observation: "A definition may very well rely upon notions that are equivalent to the one being defined; indeed, in every definition ''definiens'' and ''definiendum'' are equivalent notions, and the strict observance of Poincaré's demand would make every definition, hence all of science, impossible".&lt;ref&gt;van Heijenoort 1967:191&lt;/ref&gt;

Zermelo's example of minimum and maximum of a previously defined "completed" set of numbers reappears in Kleene 1952:42-42 where Kleene uses the example of [[Least upper bound]] in his discussion of impredicative definitions; Kleene does not resolve this problem. In the next paragraphs he discusses Weyl's attempt in his 1918 ''Das Kontinuum'' (''The Continuum'') to eliminate impredicative definitions and his failure to retain the "theorem that an arbitrary non-empty set {{math|M}} of real numbers having an upper bound has a least upper bound (cf. also Weyl 1919)".&lt;ref&gt;Kleene 1952:43&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] argued that "impredicative" definitions can be harmless: for instance, the definition of "tallest person in the room" is impredicative, since it depends on a set of things of which it is an element, namely the set of all persons in the room. Concerning mathematics, an example of an impredicative definition is the smallest number in a set, which is formally defined as: {{math|1={{var|y}} = min({{var|X}})}} if and only if for all elements {{math|{{var|x}}}} of {{math|{{var|X}}}}, {{math|{{var|y}}}} is less than or equal to {{math|{{var|x}}}}, and {{math|{{var|y}}}} is in {{math|{{var|X}}}}.

Burgess (2005) discusses predicative and impredicative theories at some length, in the context of [[Frege]]'s logic, [[Peano arithmetic]], [[second order arithmetic]], and [[axiomatic set theory]].

The term '''international child abduction''' is generally synonymous with international ''parental [[kidnapping]],'' ''child snatching'', and ''child stealing.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/resources/resources_545.html |title=THE EPIDEMIC OF PARENTAL CHILD-SNATCHING: AN OVERVIEW |publisher=US Department of State |author=HON. WILLIAM RIGLER and HOWARD L. WIEDER |year=2000|accessdate=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the more precise legal usage of ''international child abduction'' originates in [[private international law]] and refers to the illegal removal of children from their home by an acquaintance or family member to a foreign country. In this context, "illegal" is normally taken to mean "in breach of [[child custody|custodial rights]]" and "home" is defined as the child's [[habitual residence]]. As implied by the "breach of custodial rights," the phenomenon of international child abduction generally involves an illegal removal that creates a jurisdictional [[conflict of laws]] whereby multiple authorities and [[jurisdiction]]s could conceivably arrive at seemingly reasonable and conflicting custodial decisions with geographically limited application. Such a result often strongly affects a child's access and connection to half their family and may cause the loss of their former language, culture, name and nationality, it violates numerous [[children's rights]], and can cause severe psychological and emotional trauma to the child and family left behind.&lt;ref name="2010 Compliance Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/pdf/2010ComplianceReport.pdf |title=2010 Compliance Report |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date=|accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a common misconception that because the abductor in these cases is usually not a stranger the children are not in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii.gov/ag/mcch/files/kid_is_with_a_parent.pdf  |title="The kid is with a parent, how bad can it be?" The Crisis of Family Abductions|publisher=National Center for Missing and Exploited Children|author=Ernie Allen |date=|accessdate=2012-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harmful consequences for children and families have been shown in several studies  and child abduction has been characterized as a form of [[parental alienation]] and [[child abuse]].&lt;ref name="child abuse"&gt;[http://www.prevent-abuse-now.com/unreport.htm Parental Child Abduction is Child Abuse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926135211/http://www.prevent-abuse-now.com/unreport.htm |date=2012-09-26 }}. Nancy Faulkner, Ph.D. Presented to the United Nations Convention on Child Rights in Special Session, June 9, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Adding international dimensions to the detrimental effects of child abduction significantly increases the detrimental effects on children and families.  The modern day ease of international travel and corollary increase in international marriages is leading to a rapid rise in the number of international child abductions.&lt;ref name="2010 Compliance Report" /&gt;

International child abduction occurs when one parent unlawfully takes (or retains) a [[Minor (law)|minor]] child in a country other than the one the child has his/her habitual residence. If that country is a party to the [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]] (applicable to children under 16), then the child will usually be returned to the country of origin. 

== Origin of the term ==
What is today called "parental kidnapping," "international child abduction,", "parental child abduction" and "parental child trafficking" has existed as long as different legal jurisdictions and international borders have—though often under different names.  None of these names achieved the modern day broad acceptance of terms like international child abduction.  Lacking a common set of terminology or specifically designed laws to address the, at the time, poorly defined problem, researchers on the history of cross-border child abduction must search for terms like "custodial interference," "contempt of child custody orders," "legal kidnapping"  or, in cases where children were viewed more as property than as individual subjects of rights, name variations on theft, child-maintenance debt and smuggling, among others.&lt;ref name="pkpapers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thepkpapers.com/

Lawmakers struggled to typify and discuss '''international child abduction''' and discussions at the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law]] noted that, what some were referring to with variations on "legal kidnapping," was an oxymoron since that which is legal cannot be kidnapping and that which is kidnapping cannot be legal. The response to these concerns was the coining of the term "international child abduction."  The terms first prominent use was in the title of the 1980 [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]]. The term is not, however, used anywhere in the actual text of the convention itself in preference of the more technical terms "wrongful removal" or "wrongful retention" which were better suited for describing the mechanics of the Convention's system.&lt;ref name="HACText"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.text&amp;cid=24|title=Hague Abduction Convention text |publisher=Hcch.net |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term is now widespread in international law.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"&gt;{{cite web

==Internationalization of family law==
In all family law disputes a determination must be made as to which legal systems and laws should be applied to the dispute. This question becomes much more complicated when aspects, or parties, of the case occur in, or hail from, multiple legal jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

Today's international family law norms were heavily influenced by the concepts of [[Domicile (law)|domicile]] and [[nationality]]. In Europe these ideas were refined during the nineteenth century by Italian politician, [[Pasquale Mancini]], who believed matters of personal status were to be governed by the nationality of the person. During the same period in the US and Latin America the prevailing principle was that jurisdiction over personal matters was determined by domicile which, in the Americas, was acquired immediately upon moving to a foreign jurisdiction even if neither citizenship nor nationality were acquired.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

Starting in the late eighteenth century until the early 1920s a number of efforts were made to develop a series of international treaties governing international conflicts of law in Europe. Treaties that favored nationality as the determining jurisdictional factor either never got of the ground, were not widely signed or had substantial practical problems with countries renouncing them after signing. At the same time the inter-American system in Latin America produced the [[Bustamante Code]] of 1928 and the [[Montevideo Convention]]s of 1939 and 1940. Of particular note in these later Conventions was the introduction of a definition of "domicile" that started with a reference to the "habitual residence" for civil status. Lessons learned in prior efforts to create successful multilateral treaties culminated in a number of successful treaties in the mid-1900s, such as the 1961 Convention on the Protection of Minors, the New York Convention of 1956 on the Recovery Abroad of Maintenance drafted under the auspices of the [[United Nations]], and the [[Hague Convention of 1961 concerning the powers of authorities and the law applicable in respect of the protection of minors]] ("1961 Convention.") &lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

The 1961 Convention brought an innovation in terminology by creating a compromise between advocates of "nationality" as the determining factor for jurisdiction and advocates for the modern fact-centric model of "habitual residence."  It also included expanded language to encompass both judicial and administrative authorities in response to the [[Boll case]], in which Sweden claimed its [[public law|public administrative law]] was exempt from the [[Hague Convention of 1902 relating to the settlement of guardianship of minors|1902 Convention on the Guardianship of minors]] because it only governed domestic private judicial law and not public administrative law. The 1961 Convention also emphasized the concept of the "interests of the child" as a basis for authorities of the child's nationality to overrule the authorities of the child's habitual residence. Of particularly special note, the drafters of the 1961 Convention expressly considered a provision addressing the removal of a child from their habitual residence with an intent to evade rightful jurisdiction—primarily for child custody reasons. This first attempt to codify international child abduction failed due to an inability to agree on a definition or manner of describing the phenomenon, with a number of countries that adhered to the principle of nationality regulating personal child and family law unable to classify their nationals removing children from foreign countries to their home state as fraudulent evasion.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

In actual cases of international child abduction, this lack of a specific provision on child abduction in the 1961 treaty resulted in countries regularly interpreting the "habitual residence" concept of the Convention in a manner that allowed parents to take children to a foreign country and immediately acquire "habitual residence."  This allowed judicial [[forum shopping]] and created [[perverse incentive]]s for removing children from their homes to foreign jurisdictions in order to game the family law system and obtain a more favorable custodial outcome than could be gained in the jurisdiction of the child's home.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

In the 1970s, dissatisfaction with these results led to efforts to create conventions on the foreign recognition and enforcement of judgments to make it harder for courts to favor a parent solely because that parent is a national suing in his or her home state. Canada also proposed that the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law|Hague Conference]] work on a Convention to address what it termed "legal kidnapping." The Hague received Canada's request enthusiastically and, inspired by a Swiss proposal originally submitted at the Council of Europe in 1976 coined a new term in international family law – "international child abduction."&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;  Although the problem of international child abduction was well understood, finding a way to address the problem in practice was exceedingly difficult, but the Swiss proposal had a solution that was elegant in its simplicity. Why not simply restore the ''status quo ante''?&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

In 1980 the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law|Hague Conference]] drafted a convention to address the problem of international child abduction: the [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]] – commonly referred to as the [[Abduction Convention]]. The Swiss idea of restoring the ''status quo ante'' after a "wrongful removal" or "wrongful retention" became a mainstay of the Abduction Convention. Under the convention, an application could be made for the return of a child who had been wrongfully removed or retained so long as the applicant possessed rights of custody, and provided that those rights were being "actually exercised" at the time of the abduction. The concept of "actually exercised" in reference to custodial rights itself was an innovation in terminology. Having met these requirements a child was to be returned "forthwith" except in exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name="HACText"/&gt;

Inspired by the [[Hague Evidence Convention]] and the [[Hague Service Convention]]'s of 1965 and 1970, the Abduction Convention required the establishment of a single [[Central Authority]] in each country that would handle two-way communications with domestic courts, administrative agencies and foreign central authorities. Furthermore, each central authority was required to take "any and all actions" to secure the goals of the treaty and cooperate with other central authorities to do the same. All of these new obligations emphasized the need for international cooperation amongst state parties in achieving the objectives of the convention.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

=== The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child ===
{{Main|Convention on the Rights of the Child}}

Established in 1989 the '''Convention on the Rights of the Child''' reflected the growing international consensus that children be viewed as a subject of rights and not merely as an object of rights or of protective action. The [[UNCRC]] roused an unprecedented response with 187 countries ratifying it within seven years forming an essential backdrop in international children's law. Article 11 of the Convention explicitly requires State Parties to combat the illicit transfer and retention of children and promote the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral agreements or accession to existing agreements that do so, Article 35 stipulates that "States Parties shall take all appropriate national, bilateral and multilateral measures to prevent the abduction, sale or traffic of children for any purpose or in any form."&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

=== The Hague Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Cooperation ===
{{Main|Hague Convention 1996}}

The 1996 '''Convention on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law, Recognition, Enforcement and Co-operation in respect of Parental Responsibility and Measures''' is the third of the modern [[Hague Convention 1996|Hague Conventions]] on international family law, following in the footsteps of the [[Hague Abduction Convention|Abduction Convention]] and the [[Hague Adoption Convention|Adoption Convention]]. It is much broader in scope than the first two conventions and covers a wide range of civil measures related to the protection of children including: orders concerning parental responsibility and contact, public measures of protection or care, matters of legal representation and the protection of children's property.

The Convention has uniform rules determining which country's authorities are competent to take the necessary measures of protection. The Convention also determines which country's laws are to be applied and provides for the recognition and enforcement of measures taken in one Contracting State in all the other Contracting States. The co-operation provisions of the Convention provide the basic framework for the exchange of information and the necessary degree of collaboration between administrative authorities in the Contracting States. Reflecting an ever-increasing emphasis on the need for international cooperation as an essential element in the success of these measures the Convention has a full chapter on cooperation consisting of eleven articles.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;

Although initially slow to gain support and plagued with political problems, the number of states acceding to it has begun to grow.

== Impact on society, families and children ==
[[File:Report on the Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (2007 edition - front cover).jpg|thumb|175px|alt=2007 Report Cover|Cover of a US report on International Child Abduction (2007)]]

As the result of the harmful effects on children, parental kidnapping has been characterized as a form of child abuse and an extreme form of [[parental alienation]].  Abducted children suffer emotionally and sometimes physically at the hands of their abducting parents. Many are told the other parent is dead or has abandoned them. Uprooted from their entire life, home, family and friends, abducted children are often even given new names by their abductors and instructed to hide their real names or where they used to live.  Generally the abductor avoids mentioning the victim parent and waits for time to erase difficult questions, such as "When can we see mom/dad again?". These children become hostages.  It is beyond their comprehension that a parent who truly cares and loves them cannot discover their whereabouts.  Childhood cannot be recaptured.  Abductions rob a child of their sense of history, intimacy, values and morals, self-awareness, opportunity of knowing one's beginnings and the love and contact of extended family—a loss virtually no child possesses the ability to protect themselves against.

Huntington (1982) lists some of the deleterious effects of abduction on child victims:

1.  	Depression;&lt;br/&gt;
2.  	Loss of community;&lt;br/&gt;
3.  	Loss of stability, security, and trust;&lt;br/&gt;
4.  	Excessive fearfulness, even of ordinary occurrences;&lt;br/&gt;
5.  	Loneliness;&lt;br/&gt;
6.  	Anger;&lt;br/&gt;
7.  	Helplessness;&lt;br/&gt;
8.  	Disruption in identity formation; and&lt;br/&gt;
9.  	Fear of abandonment.

Many of these effects can be subsumed by the problems relevant to [[reactive attachment disorder]], stress, fear of abandonment, [[learned helplessness]], and guilt.

The extended support systems of abducting and victim parents can also become part of the dispute.  Believing primarily one side of the abduction story, family, friends, and professionals in each parents individual country may lose their objectivity. As a result, protective concerns expressed by the abandoned parent may be viewed as undue criticism, interference, and histrionics preventing the victim parent from effectively relieving the trauma imposed on their innocent child by the abduction.&lt;ref name="child abuse"/&gt;

== Mediation in child abduction cases ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}

Mediation is a process during which abductors and the left behind family, assisted by mediator(s), attempt to resolve conflicts independent of the judicial system. Mediators create a constructive atmosphere for discussions and ensure fair dealings between parents. The mediators do not make decisions; instead, they confine themselves to assisting the parties in working out for themselves a fair and sensible solution to their problems. More specifically, the mediation can address not only the child’s primary residence, but also the child’s contact with both parents, visitation arrangements, agreements concerning the child’s maintenance, schooling, further education, bi-cultural and bi-lingual upbringing, necessary arrangements for financial support etc.

Mediation can be helpful in international child abduction cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reunite.org/edit/files/Library%20-%20reunite%20Publications/Mediation%20research%20report.pdf] Reunite research 2012
&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of mediation families can deal with the question of return and also find solutions to other issues relating to their children.

== Legal justifications for abduction ==

International law has generally recognized that there may be extenuating circumstances where a child abduction may have been necessary or justifiable due to extenuating circumstances. The [[Hague Convention of 1902 relating to the settlement of guardianship of minors|1902 Convention on the Guardianship of minors]] limited such considerations to strictly emergency situations. Starting with the [[1924 Declaration on the Rights of the Child]] and the [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child|1959 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child]] there was a growing recognition at the international level of the shift in nation's domestic laws away from parental authority and towards an emphasis on protecting the child, even from their own parents.&lt;ref name="Dyer paper"/&gt;  This foreshadowed the 1989 [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]] and led to the establishment of exceptional circumstances in Article 13 of the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] where the removal of children would not be considered child abduction and allow the child to remain in their new country.&lt;ref name="HACText"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perez-Vera Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hcch.e-vision.nl/upload/expl28.pdf |title=Explanatory Report |publisher=Hcch.net |author=Elisa Perez-Vera|accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abduction Convention: "Grave risks of harm" and "intolerable situations" ===
The principal purpose of the Abduction Convention is to cause the prompt return of a child to his or her "habitual residence."  In certain exceptional cases under Article 13b, the court's mandatory return obligation is changed to a discretionary obligation, specifically, "the judicial or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that there is a ''grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation.''"  It is important to note that the duty to return a child is not abrogated by a finding under Art. 13(b) but merely changes from mandatory to discretionary. Since the general intent of the Convention is to cause the return of a child to his or her "habitual residence," unless there are some powerful and compelling reasons otherwise the court is normally and routinely expected to exercise its discretion and return the child to his or her "habitual residence".

In the primary source of interpretation for the Convention, the Explanatory Report, Professor E. Perez-Vera noted the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"it would seem necessary to underline the fact that the three types of exception to the rule concerning the return of the child must be applied only so far as they go and no further. This implies above all that they are to be interpreted in a restrictive fashion if the Convention is not to become a dead letter. In fact, the Convention as a whole rests upon the unanimous rejection of this phenomenon of illegal child removals and upon the conviction that the best way to combat them at an international level is to refuse to grant them legal recognition. The practical application of this principle requires that the signatory States be convinced that they belong, despite their differences, to the same legal community within which the authorities of each State acknowledge that the authorities of one of them – those of the child's habitual residence – are in principle best placed to decide upon questions of custody and access. As a result, a systematic invocation of the said exceptions, substituting the forum chosen by the abductor for that of the child's residence, would lead to the collapse of the whole structure of the Convention by depriving it of the spirit of mutual confidence which is its inspiration."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In spite of the spirit and intent of the Convention as conveyed by the Convention itself and further reinforced by the Perez-Vera report, Article 13b is frequently used by abductors as a vehicle to litigate the child's [[best interests]] or [[child custody|custody]]. Although Article 13(b) inquiries are not intended to deal with issues or factual questions appropriate for custody proceedings, many countries use article 13b to request psychological profiles, detailed evaluations of parental fitness, evidence concerning lifestyle and the nature and quality of relationships.&lt;ref name="Grave risk and Art. 13b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hiltonhouse.com/articles/Art_13(b)_limit.txt |title=The Limitations on Art. 13(b) of The Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction done at the Hague on 25 Oct 1980 |author=William M. Hilton |year=1997|accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These misinterpretations of the Abduction Convention's exceptions have rendered the Convention largely ineffective in accomplishing its objectives. The ''best interests'' of a child, which is explicitly never mentioned in the Convention, is an essentially subjective standard that judges often use to facilitate foreign nations' manipulation of the treaty and create a pretext for discretionary decisions. This discretion often takes the form of gender, cultural and national biases. The result is substantive non-compliance with the Abduction Convention.&lt;ref name="Who's Best Interest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/legal/1001334-1.html |title=Whose best interest? International child abduction under the Hague Convention |publisher=Chicago Journal of International Law |author=Leto, Marisa |date=2000-04-01|accessdate=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic violence ===
[[File:Grandville Cent Proverbes page69.png|thumb|150px|alt=Domestic Violence|Domestic Violence]]
{{see also|Domestic violence}}
At the time the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] was drafted domestic violence was never explicitly considered as an [[affirmative defense]] for child abduction, although it may be brought as a defense under Article 13, if "there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation." Article 13 supposed that the child's primary caretaker would abduct the child to escape the domestic violence of a non-custodial parent. At the time of the Conventions drafting, [[joint custody]] laws were rare. One parent was usually both the custodial parent and primary caretaker while the other, non-custodial parent had rights of access. The move towards joint custody laws conferred both the parent who acted as the primary caretaker and their ex-partner with custodial rights and, by extension, a right to request the return of children wrongfully removed from their place of habitual residence. In addition to not accounting for a shift in child custody law towards shared parenting and joint custody, according to Weiner, the framers of the Convention also did little to account for the motivation for abducting a child, generally assuming that all abductions were harmful to children; however, the child's primary caretaker may be fleeing with a child to protect himself or herself from a dangerous domestic situation.&lt;ref name="DV and ICA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lclac.org/FordhamLawReview.htm |title=International Child Abduction and the Escape from Domestic Violence|publisher=Fordham Law Review |year=2000 |author=Merle H.

==Global Missing Children’s Network==
Launched in 1998 as a [[joint venture]] of the [[International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] (ICMEC) and the US [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]], the Global Missing Children’s Network (GMCN) is a network of countries that connect, share [[best practices]], and disseminate information and images of missing children to improve the effectiveness of missing children investigations.&lt;ref name=ncmissing&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/GMCN|title=Global Missing Children's Network|publisher=NCMEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cyber&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0rVfRwcIPYgC&amp;pg=SA11-PA31&amp;dq=icmec+children#v=onepage&amp;q=icmec%20children&amp;f=false|title=Computer Forensics: Investigating Network Intrusions and Cyber Crime|author= EC-Council|publisher= Cengage Learning|pages=11–26, 11–31 to 11–33|year= 2009|isbn=1435483529}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=more/&gt;  The Network has 22 member countries: Albania, Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Russia, Serbia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the US.&lt;ref name=more&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/activities-in-more-than-22-countries-around-the-globe-will-remember-missing-children-on-may-25-2013-05-22|title=Activities in More than 22 Countries around the Globe will Remember Missing Children on May 25|date=May 22, 2013|work=MarketWatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{no footnotes|date=September 2015}}
In [[Ramsey theory]], a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' of [[natural number]]s is considered to be a large set if and only if [[Van der Waerden's theorem]] can be generalized to assert the existence of [[arithmetic progressions]] with common difference in ''S''.  That is, ''S'' is large if and only if every finite partition of the natural numbers has a cell containing arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions having common differences in ''S''.

==Examples==
*The natural numbers are large. This is precisely the assertion of [[Van der Waerden's theorem]].
*The even numbers are large.

==Properties==
Necessary conditions for largeness include:
*If ''S'' is large, for any natural number ''n'', ''S'' must contain at least one multiple (equivalently, infinitely many multiples) of ''n''. 
*If &lt;math&gt;S=\{s_1,s_2,s_3,\dots\}&lt;/math&gt; is large, it is not the case that ''s''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;≥3''s''&lt;sub&gt;k-1&lt;/sub&gt; for ''k''≥ 2.

Two sufficient conditions are:
*If ''S'' contains n-cubes for [[arbitrarily large]] n, then ''S'' is large.
*If &lt;math&gt;S =p(\mathbb{N}) \cap \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial with &lt;math&gt;p(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; and positive leading coefficient, then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is large.

The first sufficient condition implies that if ''S'' is a [[thick set]], then ''S'' is large.

Other facts about large sets include:
*If ''S'' is large and ''F'' is finite, then ''S&amp;nbsp;[[Complement (set theory)|–]]&amp;nbsp;F'' is large.
*&lt;math&gt;k\cdot \mathbb{N}=\{k,2k,3k,\dots\}&lt;/math&gt; is large. 
*If S is large, &lt;math&gt;k\cdot S&lt;/math&gt; is also large.
If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is large, then for any &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S \cap \{ x : x \equiv 0\pmod{m} \}&lt;/math&gt; is large.

==2-large and k-large sets==
A set is '''''k''-large''', for a natural number ''k'' &gt; 0, when it meets the conditions for largeness when the restatement of [[van der Waerden's theorem]] is concerned only with ''k''-colorings. Every set is either large or ''k''-large for some maximal ''k''. This follows from two important, albeit trivially true, facts:
*''k''-largeness implies (''k''-1)-largeness for k&amp;gt;1
*''k''-largeness for all ''k'' implies largeness.

It is unknown whether there are 2-large sets that are not also large sets. Brown, Graham, and Landman (1999) conjecture that no such sets exists.

== Synopsis ==
Fair trading is very much in fashion today. The concept is to help the most underprivileged populations on our planet to emerge from this state thanks to a fairer distribution of revenues. The [[Shea nut and butter production in Burkina Faso|Shea butter]] is produced by the poorest women of [[Burkina Faso]], and is more and more appreciated in Europe. It is used in the cosmetic industry and as a cocoa substitute.  Various fair trading experiences claim to help them but, who really profits from the money of the butter?&lt;ref name=voir&gt;{{cite web|title=BEURRE ET L’ARGENT DU BEURRE (LE)|url=http://voiretagir.org/BEURRE-ET-L-ARGENT-DU-BEURRE-LE.html|work=Voir et agir|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Utopia&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Beurre et l'argent du beurre|url=http://www.atelierideal.lautre.net/IMG/pdf/chronique-utopia-LeBeurre.pdf|publisher=Cinema Utopia|accessdate=11 March 2012|location=Bordeaux, France}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IntNews&gt;{{cite news|title=Commerce "équitable": le beurre et l'argent du beurre (docu)|url=http://internationalnews.over-blog.com/article-31826072.html|accessdate=11 March 2012|newspaper=International News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lessons learned''' or '''lessons learnt''' are experiences distilled from a project that should be actively taken into account in future projects. 

There are several definitions of the concept. The one used by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], [[European Space Agency]] and [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] sounds as follows: 
“A lesson learned is knowledge or understanding gained by experience. The experience may be positive, as in a successful test or mission, or negative, as in a mishap or failure...A lesson must be significant in that it has a real or assumed impact on operations; valid in that is factually and technically correct; and applicable in that it identifies a specific design, process, or decision that reduces or eliminates the potential for failures and mishaps, or reinforces a positive result.” &lt;ref&gt;[Secchi, P. (Ed.) (1999). Proceedings of Alerts and Lessons Learned: An Effective way to prevent failures and problems (Technical Report WPP-167). Noordwijk, The Netherlands: ESTEC] &lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Development Assistance Committee]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] defines lessons learned as “Generalizations based on evaluation experiences with projects, programs, or policies that abstract from the specific circumstances to broader situations. Frequently, lessons highlight strengths or weaknesses in preparation, design, and implementation that affect performance, outcome, and impact.” &lt;ref&gt;[OECD – DAC (2002) Glossary of Key Terms in Evaluation and Results Based Management. Evaluation and Aid Effectiveness No 6. http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/29/21/2754804.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;

In the practice of the [[United Nations]] the concept has been made explicit in the name of their [[Working Group on Lessons Learned]] of the [[Peacebuilding Commission]].
In the military field, conducting a Lessons learned analysis requires a leader-led after-actions debriefing. These debriefings require the leader to extend the lessons-learned orientation of the standard after-action review. He uses the event reconstruction approach or has the individuals present their own roles and perceptions of the event, whichever best fits the situation and time available.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Army (2009). Field Manual No. 6-22.5. Combat and Operational Stress Control Manual for Leaders and Soldiers. Department of the Army Headquarters, Washington, DC, 18 March 2009. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Clark''' (born 1 April 1954) is a contemporary British artist. His work spans a broad range of media including painting, drawing, sculpture, film, photography, installation, video, performance and artist's books. Clark was born in Manchester and lives and works in London.

== Life and work ==
In 1977 Clark met [[Muriel Belcher]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] in [[The Colony Room]] club in Soho.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p030kfnc|title='When Bacon is in your bloodstream he never leaves you', 24 August 2015, Today - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clark's portrait of Belcher on her deathbed (''Muriel Belcher Ill in bed'') was part of the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] in 1981, and won the Charles Wollaston Award. At the suggestion of Valerie Beston, of [[Marlborough Fine Art]], Clark made the first of a series of portraits of Bacon, one of which is in the [[British Museum]]'s collection. "Michael Clark's portraits of Bacon emphasise the sad preoccupation of his sagging face, with eyes deep in concussed hollows grimly contemplating mortality".&lt;ref name="Conrad"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/10/art|title=The power and the passion|author=Peter Conrad|date=10 August 2008|work=The Observer|access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vanitas'' (1990-1992), Clark's double-sided portrait of [[Lisa Stansfield]], was part of ''[[The Portrait Now]]''  exhibition held from 1993–1994 at the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]. "Both the theme of the wound and the title 'Vanitas' make references to mortality. Clark was partly inspired by a Renaissance painting — also double-sided — by [[Barthel Bruyn the Elder]]."&lt;ref name=CHowse&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/13th-november-1993/40/arts|title=Beautiful Wounds|author= Christopher Howse|date=13 November 1993|work=The Spectator|access-date=3 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, Clark's ''Five Wounds''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.tooveys.com/2013/12/francis-bacon/|title=Flesh and Bones Unites Oxford and Chichester – Toovey’s Blog|website=blog.tooveys.com|language=en-GB|access-date=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been on permanent display at [[Chichester Cathedral]], alongside works by [[Graham Sutherland]], [[John Piper (artist)|John Piper]] and [[Marc Chagall]].&lt;blockquote&gt;"In some the glaze is so heavy that their raised and gleaming beads of crimson appear to flow. In others pieces of yellow 'bone' seem to rise beneath the skin. Any initial revulsion soon gives way to enchantment. [...] In the Wounds the viewer comes face to face with the very real nature of Christ's suffering and consequently with our own mortality. 'These works are forms to meditate upon' explains the artist. 'A trigger-release mechanism; a way of opening up.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/art-the-word-made-flesh-michael-clarks-paintings-of-wounds-are-now-on-display-at-chichester-1432388.html|title=The word made flesh: Michael Clark's paintings of wounds are now on display at Chichester Cathedral.

The drawing has a distinct and immediate impact, foregrounding as it does the quality of personal courage of the sitter.

Clark delivered ''Al-Jebr'', a kinetic assemblage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/explore/glossary-of-art-terms/assemblage|title=Assemblage|last=Glossary of art terms|first=|date=|website=National Portrait Gallery|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; made of mixed media portraying Roeg, which in Arabic means 'the bringing together of broken parts'.&lt;ref name="RoegNPG"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw12329/Nicholas-Roeg-al-jebr|title=Nicholas Roeg ('al-jebr')|author=National Portrait Gallery|website=www.npg.org.uk|language=en|access-date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art collection of Valerie Beston was sold at [[Christie's]] in February 2006 and included ten works by Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/jan/29/art1|title=Harriet Lane reveals passions beneath calm exterior of Miss Valerie Beston, Francis Bacon's trusted gallery administrator|author=Harriet Lane|date=29 January 2006|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying catalogue stated:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Bacon’s influence threads through his [Clark's] works, reappearing even in his conceptual pieces. Be it in the appearance of wounds in his paintings, or in the location of a ‘sound sculpture’ outside a sex shop that Bacon used to frequent (only in part to cash his cheques), his ghostly spectre appears again and again, if only obliquely, in his figurative and conceptual works. For Clark is not a portraitist, although he has created many portraits of people ranging from film directors to the characters of [[Soho]] of yesterday to Royalty to Pop royalty. He is a conceptual artist, for whom the painstakingly accurate depiction of the human face is only one of his means or media, and conversation with him ranges from the diverse influences of [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] and [[Bruce Nauman|Nauman]] as well as [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Holbein]] and [[Rembrandt]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Christie's International Media Division|date=February 2006|title=The Collection of The Late Miss Valerie Beston: Artists from the London School|journal=Auction Catalogue|volume=|pages=72|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his book, ''Francis Bacon in Your Blood,'' art historian [[Michael Peppiatt]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"A feature article&lt;ref name="Conrad"/&gt; came out a while ago in the ''Observer'' in which the author, [[Peter Conrad (academic)|Peter Conrad]], interviewed three men who had been close to Francis Bacon in their youth. He described each of them as having been 'burnt' for life by their contact with the painter. The implication was that you did not survive the influence of a genius as dark and powerful as Bacon. The three men were the photographer [[Peter Beard]], the artist Michael Clark, and myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NlJFCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT7&amp;lpg=PT7&amp;dq=francis+bacon+in+your+blood+francis+bacon+michael+clark&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3tXzOQxChg&amp;sig=91xuEJowZpSMBqEHaTjFAbS0gP8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwit0oKnls7ZAhUsIcAKHaPMA7QQ6AEwD3oECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=francis%20bacon%20in%20your%20blood%20francis%20bacon%20michael%20clark&amp;f=false|title=Francis Bacon in Your Blood|author=Michael Peppiatt|first=Michael|publisher=Bloomsbury Circus|year=2015|isbn=1408856247|location=UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{redirect|Mentality}}
{{More footnotes|date=July 2010}}
In [[decision theory]] and [[systems theory|general systems theory]], a '''mindset''' is a set of assumptions, methods, or notations held by one or more people or groups of people.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

A mindset can also be seen as incident of a person's [[world view]] or [[Philosophy of Life|philosophy of life]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}

A mindset may be so firmly established that it creates a powerful incentive within these people or groups to continue to adopt or accept prior behaviors, choices, or tools.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}  The latter phenomenon is also sometimes described as ''mental inertia'', "[[groupthink]]", and it is often difficult to counteract its effects upon analysis and decision making processes.

In cognitive psychology, a mindset represents the cognitive processes activated in response to a given task (French, 2016). 

== History (Academic) ==
It would appear that some of the earliest empirical explorations of mindset originated in the early 1900s (Gollwitzer 1990, 2012). These studies are identified as foundational to and precursory for the study of cognition (Gollwitzer 1990, 2012). The attention to mindset within the study of cognitive psychology has continued relatively unabated. In addition to the field of cognitive psychology, the use of mindset is evident within the social sciences and several other fields (e.g., [[positive psychology]]). A characteristic of this area of study, in all its various manifestations, is the fragment use of mindset throughout the academy (e.g. French, 2016).

==In politics==
A well-known{{By whom|date=September 2013}} example is the "[[Cold War]] mindset" prevalent in both the U.S. and [[USSR]], which included absolute trust in two-player [[game theory]], in the integrity of [[chain of command|command chain]], in control of nuclear materials, and in the [[mutual assured destruction]] of both in the case of war.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Although most consider that this mindset usefully served to prevent an attack by either country, the assumptions underlying [[deterrence theory]] have made assessments of the efficacy of the Cold War mindset a matter of some controversy.

Most theorists consider that the key responsibility of an embedded power group is to challenge the assumptions that comprise the group's own mindset.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} According to these commentators, power groups that fail to review or revise their mindsets with sufficient regularity cannot hold power indefinitely, as a single mindset is unlikely to possess the flexibility and adaptability needed to address all future events. For example, the variations in mindset between [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] Presidents in the U.S. may have made that country more able to challenge assumptions than the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] with its more static bureaucracy.

Modern military theory attempts to challenge entrenched mindsets in dealing with [[asymmetric warfare]], [[terrorism]], and the proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]]. In combination, these threats represent "a revolution in military affairs" and require very rapid adaptation to new threats and circumstances. In this context, the cost of not implementing adaptive mindsets cannot be afforded.

==In system thinking==
Building on [[Magoroh Maruyama]]'s concept of Mindscape,&lt;ref&gt;Maruyama, M. (1980). Mindscapes and Science Theories, Current Anthropology, Vol. 21, No. 5. (Oct., 1980), pp. 589-608&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maruyama, M. (1988). Dynamics among Business Practice, Aesthetics, Science, Politics and Religion. Cultural Dynamics 1988; 1; 309-335&lt;/ref&gt; Mindset Theory includes cultural and social orientation type values: Hierarchical Individualism (HI), Egalitarian Collectivism (EC), Egalitarian Individualism (EI), Hierarchical Collectivism (HC), Hierarchic Synergism (HS), Egalitarian Populism (EP), Egalitarian Synergism (ES), and  Hierarchical Populism (HP).&lt;ref&gt;Yolles, M.I, Fink, G., 2014, Personality, pathology and mindsets: part 1-3. Vol. 43 n.(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collective==
Naturally, the question regarding the embodiment of a collective mindset comes to mind. Erikson's (1974) analysis of group-identities and what he calls a life-plan seems relevant here. He recounts the example of American Indians, who were meant to undergo a reeducation process meant to imbue a modern "life-plan" that aimed for a house and a richness expressed by a filled bank account. Erikson writes that the Indians' collective historic identity as buffalo hunters was oriented around such fundamentally different reasons/goals that even communication about the divergent "life plans" was itself difficult.

There is a double relation between the institution embodying for example an [[entrepreneurial mindset]] and its entrepreneurial performance. Firstly, an institution with an entrepreneurial philosophy will set entrepreneurial goals and strategies as a whole, but maybe even more importantly, it will foster an entrepreneurial milieu, allowing each entity to pursue emergent opportunities. In short, philosophical stance codified in the mind, hence as mindset, lead to a climate that in turn causes values that lead to practice.

Collective mindsets in this sense are described in such works as Hutchin's "Cognition in the wild" (1995), who analyzes a whole team of naval navigators as the cognitive unit or as computational system, or Senges' Knowledge entrepreneurship in universities (2007). There are also parallels to the emerging field of "collective intelligence" (e.g. (Zara, 2004)) and exploiting the "Wisdom of the crowds" (Surowiecki, 2005) of stakeholders. Zara notes that since collective reflection is more explicit, discursive, and conversational, it therefore needs a good ¿[[gestell]]?—especially when it comes to information and communication technology.

Most historians use the concept of mentality or mindset to denote very slowly changing mental dispositions active over longer periods of time, but occasionally there have been efforts to also apply it to much more rapidly changing historical situations such as the French revolution (Michel Vovelle) or the short period of Allied occupation of Germany after World War II (Hentschel 2007).

==Specific theories==
{{undue weight|date=April 2015}}

=== Types and theories ===
As previously alluded to, there is a great deal of variation within the study of mindsets. This variation includes how to define, measure, and conceptualize a mindset as well as the types of mindset identified. Even amongst scholars within the same disciple studying the same mindset, substantial variations exist (French, 2016). Nevertheless, any discussion of mindset should include recognition concerning the numerous, varied, and growing number of mindsets and mindset theories that receive attention in multiple disciplines throughout the academy. 

===Fixed and growth===
According to [[Carol Dweck]],&lt;ref name="dweck-book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dweck|first=Carol|authorlink= Carol Dweck |title=Mindset: The New Psychology of Success|date=2006|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-345-47232-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; individuals can be placed on a continuum according to their implicit views of "where ability comes from".

Dweck states that there are two categories ('''growth mindset''' versus '''fixed mindset''') that can group individuals based on their behaviour, specifically their reaction to failure.
Those with a "fixed mindset" believe that abilities are mostly innate and interpret failure as the lack of necessary basic abilities, while those with a "growth mindset" believe that they can acquire any given ability provided they invest effort or study.

Dweck argues that the growth mindset "will allow a person to live a less stressful and more successful life".

In a 2012 interview, Dweck defined both fixed and growth mindsets:
{{Quote|In a fixed mindset students believe their basic abilities, their intelligence, their talents, are just fixed traits. They have a certain amount and that's that, and then their goal becomes to look smart all the time and never look dumb. In a growth mindset students understand that their talents and abilities can be developed through effort, good teaching and persistence. They don't necessarily think everyone's the same or anyone can be Einstein, but they believe everyone can get smarter if they work at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onedublin.org/2012/06/19/stanford-universitys-carol-dweck-on-the-growth-mindset-and-education/|title=Stanford University’s Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset and Education|date=2012-06-19|work=OneDublin.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

A large part of Dweck's research on mindsets has been done in the field of education, and how these mindsets affect a student's performance in the classroom. The growth mindset is clearly the more desirable of the two for students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yeager |first1=Devid |last2=Dweck |first2=Carol |authorlink= Carol Dweck |title=Mindsets That Promote Resilience: When Students Believe That Personal Characteristics Can Be Developed |journal=Educational Psychologist |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |date=2012 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=302–314 |url=http://www.gradnation.org/sites/default/files/Midsets%20that%20Promote%20Resilience%20Yeager%20Dweck.pdf |accessdate=12 April 2016 |doi=10.1080/00461520.2012.722805}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, an individual's mindset impacts how they face and cope with challenges, such as the transition into junior high school from elementary school or losing your job.&lt;ref name="dweck-book" /&gt; According to Dweck, individuals with a "growth" theory are more likely to continue working hard despite setbacks. Individuals' theories of intelligence can be affected by subtle environmental cues. For example, children given [[praise]] such as "good job, you're very smart" are much more likely to develop a fixed mindset, whereas if given compliments like "good job, you worked very hard" they are likely to develop a growth mindset.

While elements of our personality – such as sensitivity to mistakes and setbacks – can make us predisposed towards holding a certain mindset, we are able to develop and reshape our mindset through our interactions.&lt;ref name="Aldhous, P. 2008"&gt;Aldhous, P. (2008). Free your mind and watch it grow. New Scientist, 199(2670), 44-45.&lt;/ref&gt; In multiple studies, Dweck and her colleagues noted that alterations in mindset could be achieved through "praising the process through which success was achieved",&lt;ref&gt;Cimpian, A., Aree, H.C., Markman, E.M., Dweck, C.S. (2007). Subtle linguistic cues affect children’s motivation. Association for Psychological Science, 18(4), 314-316.&lt;/ref&gt; "having [college aged students] read compelling scientific articles that support one view or the other",&lt;ref name="Aldhous, P. 2008"/&gt; or teaching junior high school students "that every time they try hard and learn something new, their brain forms new connections that, over time, make them smarter".&lt;ref&gt;Dweck, C.S. (2007). The perils and promises of praise. Early Intervention at Every Age, 65(2), 34-39.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies all demonstrate how framing and discussing students' work and effort play a considerable role in the type of mindset students develop and students' conceptions of their own ability.

Carol Dweck and Jo Boaler have done extensive research on the topics of fixed and growth mindset. However, studies on mindset depict results that show that there is a disparity in the fixed and growth mindsets of females and males. In Boaler's Ability and Mathematics: the Mindset Revolution that is Reshaping Education, she notes that fixed mindset beliefs lead to inequalities in education and are a main reason for low achievement and participation amongst minorities and female students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boaler|first=Jo|date=2013|title=Ability and Mathematics: the mindset revolution that is reshaping education|url=http://www.youcubed.org/wp-content/uploads/14_Boaler_FORUM_55_1_web.pdf|journal=Forum|volume=55 No. 1|pages=143-152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boaler's research shows that many women feel as though they are not smart enough nor capable enough to continue in certain subjects, such as STEM areas of academia. Boaler uses Carol Dweck's research showing that "gender differences in mathematics performance only existed among fixed mindset students" (Boaler, 2013).

In addition, there have been tests administered by L.S. Blackwell to see if the fixed mindset of women can be changed to a growth mindset (Boaler, 2013). This is the mindset in which Boaler and Dweck believe people can gain knowledge. Boaler said, "The key growth mindset message was that effort changes the brain by forming new connections, and that students control this process. The growth mindset intervention halted the students’ decline in grades and started the students on a new pathway of improvement and high achievement" (Boaler, 2013). Educational systems focusing on creating a growth mindset environment allows for girls to feel like their intelligence is moldable rather than constant. 

Dweck’s research and theory of growth and fixed mindsets has been useful in intervention strategies with at risk students, dispelling negative stereotypes in education held by teachers and students, understanding the impacts of self-theories on resilience, and understanding how process praise can foster a growth mindset and positively impact students' motivation levels.&lt;ref&gt;Veronikas, S., Shaughnessy, M.F. (2004). A reflective conversation with Carol Dweck. Gifted Education International, 19(1), 27-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, there has been criticism leveraged at "growth mindset" as a concept, and the related research that has been carried out. See the page on [[Carol_Dweck|Carol Dweck]], under the header [[Carol_Dweck#Criticism|criticism]].

==== Benefit ====
In 2015, [http://www.cohere.com.au/the-benefit-mindset/ Ashley Buchanan] proposed a complimentary evolution to the fixed and growth mindset – [http://www.benefitmindset.com/ the benefit mindset].

The benefit mindset describes society's everyday leaders who promote well-being on both an individual and a collective level. That is, people who discover their strengths to make valuable contributions to causes that are greater than the self. They question why they do what they do, positioning their actions within a purposeful context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Ashley|last2=Kern|first2=Margaret L.|date=2017-06-08|title=The benefit mindset: The psychology of contribution and everyday leadership|url=https://internationaljournalofwellbeing.org/index.php/ijow/article/view/538|journal=International Journal of Wellbeing|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.5502/ijw.v7i1.538|issn=1179-8602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buchanan argues "creating cultures of contribution and everyday leadership could be one of the best points of leverage we have for simultaneously bringing out the best in people, organisations and the planet."

=== Global Mindset ===
Originating from the study of organizational leadership and coinciding with the growth of multinational corporations in the 1980s, organizations observed that the effectiveness of their executives did not necessarily translate cross-culturally. Global mindset emerged as an explanation (Javidan &amp; Walker, 2013). Essentially, leaders in cross-cultural contexts were hypothesized to need an additional skill, ability, or proficiency (i.e. a global mindset) that enabled effectiveness regardless of the culture or context (Perlmutter, 1969; Rhinesmith, 1992). 

One of the defining characteristics of the study of global mindset is the variety in which scholars conceptualize and operationalize the construct; and yet; scholars typically agree that global mindset and its development increases global effectiveness for both individuals and organizations (French &amp; Chang, 2016).

===Abundance and scarcity===
{{Main article|Abundance mindset}}
Those with abundance mindset believe that there are enough resources for everyone, while those with the scarcity mindset believe that there is a limited number of resources and that [[Zero-sum_game|one's gain must entail another's loss]], leading to competition for resources.

===Productive and defensive===
According to [[Chris Argyris]] (2004), there are two dominant mindsets in organizations: the productive mindset and the defensive mindset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbswk.hbs.edu/archive/4456.html|title=Surfacing Your Underground Organization |date=2004-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The productive mindset seeks out valid knowledge that is testable. The productive reasoning mindset creates informed choices and makes reasoning transparent.

The defensive mindset, on the other hand, is self-protective and self-deceptive. When this mindset is active, people or organizations only seek out information that will protect them. Truth can be shut out when it is seen as threatening. The defensive mindset may lead to learning based on false assumptions or prevent learning altogether (Argyris, 2004).

The '''Movement for a Democratic Military (MDM)''' was an antiwar and GI rights organization during the Vietnam War. Initially formed in late 1969 as a merger of sailors from San Diego and marines from the [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton Marine Base]] in Oceanside, CA, it rapidly spread to a number of other cities and bases in California and the mid-West, including San Francisco, Long Beach Naval Station, El Toro Marine Air Station, Fort Ord, Fort Carson and the Great Lakes Naval Training Center. Heavily influenced by the Black Panther Party and the Black militancy of the times.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-last=Alexander |editor-first=Leslie |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African American History |url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=A1640C |access-date=2017-08-16 |year=2010 |publisher= ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=978-1-85109-769-2 |pages=1080}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moser"&gt;{{cite book |last=Moser |first=Richard |date=1996 |title=The New Winter Soldiers: GI and Veteran Dissent During the Vietnam Era |url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/the-new-winter-soldiers/9780813522425 |location=New Brunswick, NJ |publisher=Rutgers University Press |page=88 |isbn=978-0-8135-2242-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became one of the more radical GI organizations during that era and was investigated in 1971 by the [[United States House Committee on Internal Security|House Committee on Internal Security]] (formally HUAC). As with much of the GI movement during this era, chapters had a high turnover as members were transferred, discharged and disciplined by the military. By late 1970 several chapters had splintered or disbanded, but the group's name and demands proved popular within the GI resistance movement overall.&lt;ref name="Parsons"&gt;{{cite book |last=Parsons |first=David L. |date=2017 |title=Dangerous Grounds: Antiwar Coffeehouses and Military Dissent in the Vietnam Era |url=https://www.uncpress.org/book/9781469632018/dangerous-grounds/ |location=Chapel Hill, NC |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |page=74 &amp; 98 |isbn=978-1-4696-3201-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortright"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cortright |first=David |date=2005 |title=Soldiers In Revolt |url=https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/826-soldiers-in-revolt |location=Chicago, IL |publisher=Haymarket Books |pages=64, 108 &amp; 116 |isbn=1931859272 |author-link=David Cortright}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some chapters continued through 1971 and 1972 and one until 1975.

==Founding==

MDM started at the civilian supported ''Green Machine'' antiwar coffeehouse in Vista, CA not far from Camp Pendleton.&lt;ref name="Oceanside"&gt;[https://www.oceansidechamber.com/oceanside-blog/history-of-oceanside-1963-1987 Oceanside Chamber of Commerce History of Oceanside]&lt;/ref&gt; It began as a merger of a small group of sailors in San Diego called [[GI's Against Fascism]] and a larger group of marines at Camp Pendleton.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Barnes |first=Peter |date=1972 |title=Pawns: The Plight of the Citizen-Soldier |location=New York, NY |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |pages=128–9 |isbn=0-394-43616-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The San Diego group already had a newspaper called ''Duck Power'' and the marines began by publishing a newspaper called ''Attitude Check'' whose first issue, dated November 1, 1969, announced that it was "written by marines and ex-marines for the benefit of the common snuffy, grunt, and em." The organization seemed to hit a nerve among local marines and sailors and on December 14 in nearby Oceanside an estimated 1,000 Black, White and Chicano GIs were among 4,000 who participated in an antiwar march and rally with speeches by [[Donald W. Duncan]], [[Captain Howard Levy]], [[Angela Davis]] and a number of active duty GIs.&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Attitude"&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/39085/rec/2, Wisconsin Historical Society GI Press Collection: Attitude Check]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortright"/&gt;

==Preamble and 12 Demands==

At this rally, MDM's spokespeople presented and explained the organization's Preamble and 12 Demands, which had also been published simultaneously in the December 1, 1970 issues of ''Duck Power'' and ''Attitude Check''. The Preamble stated "that ending the suppression of the American serviceman is an important part of a larger struggle for basic human rights" and pledged "support for the self-determination of all peoples." It ended, "We have been silent for a long time. We will be silent no longer."

The 12 demands included: An immediate end to the Vietnam War, collective bargaining for GIs, "human and constitutional rights [for] military men and women," the ending of censorship and intimidation within the military, the abolition of "mental and physical cruelty in military brigs, correctional custodies, and basic training", doing away with the "court-martial and non-judicial punishment systems," "wages equal to the federal minimum wage," "the abolition of the class structure of the military," an end to "all racism everywhere," the freeing of all political prisoners, including Eldridge Cleaver and Huey Newton," an end to "the glorification of war," and the abolition of the draft.&lt;ref name="Tishler"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tischler |first1=Barbara L. |date=1990 |title=Breaking Ranks: GI Antiwar Newspapers and the Culture of Protest |url=http://digitalcommons.lasalle.edu/vietnamgeneration/vol2/iss1/ |journal=Vietnam Generation |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=30–31 |issn=1042-7597 |access-date=2017-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/80964/rec/14, MDM Preamble and 12 Demands]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spread==

===San Diego===

The pre-existing group of sailors in San Diego called ''GI's Against Fascism'' merged with the group at Camp Pendleton.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt; They all agreed to use the MDM name while publishing two newspapers, ''Duck Power'' in San Diego and ''Attitude Check'' at Pendleton. In mid-1970 the San Diego chapter changed the name of their newspaper to ''Dare to Struggle'' which they continued to publish until mid-1971. ''Attitude Check's'' last issue was in June 1970. The Camp Pendleton and San Diego areas were very pro-military and the MDM members located there experienced significant hostility and harassment.&lt;ref name="Oceanside" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt; The San Diego area MDM had close ties with the [[San Diego Free Press]] which helped them put out their newspapers.

===Great Lakes Naval Station===

By early 1970 MDM had spread to several other cities and military bases. In January, a chapter formed at the [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] naval base, located north of Chicago, IL, the largest U.S. Navy training base and the only boot camp for naval enlistees. Aided by activists with the Wisconsin Draft Resistance and the Chicago Area Military Project, a counseling service and coffeehouse, this chapter was one of the most active and included a considerable number of black sailors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cortright |first1=David |date=1990 |title=Black GI Resistance During the Vietnam War |url=http://digitalcommons.lasalle.edu/vietnamgeneration/vol2/iss1/ |journal=Vietnam Generation |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=59 |issn=1042-7597 |access-date=2017-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They began publishing ''The Navy Times Are Changing'' which continued until the end of 1972. On Armed Forces Day in May 1970 they sponsored a rally near the base which attracted 50 sailors and nearly 500 civilians. Another rally in September of that same year "drew a crowd of over five hundred sailors and civilians." When four Black WAVES were illegally arrested by base commanders in July 1970, more than 100 sailors marched to where the women were being held and surrounded the building, refusing to move until the women were released. Within weeks of this incident, over 900 enlisted men and women were discharged or transferred to other bases by the navy. On Armed Forces Day in 1972, MDM and the Chicago Area Military Project organized a large demonstration with 400 GIs joining a crowd of over 2,000.&lt;ref name="Cortright" /&gt;

===San Francisco Bay Area===

Tom Csekey, one of the sailors who founded ''GI's Against Fascism'' in San Diego traveled to San Francisco and helped form two chapters of MDM in the Bay Area. There was a short-lived chapter at [[Fort Ord]] near Monterey, CA which published the ''Right-On Post'' from May to August 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/2832/rec/43, Right-on Post]&lt;/ref&gt; And a San Francisco Bay Area chapter with members from the [[Naval Air Station Alameda|Alameda Naval Air Station]], [[Treasure Island, San Francisco]] and other military bases, which published their newspaper ''Up Against the Bulkhead'' regularly from 1970 to 1972 and then sporadically until to 1975. The ''Up Against the Bulkhead'' paper and staff played an important role in helping sailors from the [[USS Coral Sea (CV-43)#1971: Crewmen petition against the Vietnam War|USS Coral Sea]] organize a November 6, 1971 antiwar demonstration in San Francisco involving over 300 men from the ship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://libcom.org/history/1961-1973-gi-resistance-in-the-vietnam-war 1961-1973: GI resistance in the Vietnam War]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foundsf.org/index.php?title=Up_Against_the_Bulkhead Statement from Peter Wiley, Up Against the Bulkhead Staff member]&lt;/ref&gt; This chapter was the longest lasting MDM organization and their newspaper was one of the more professional and widely distributed.&lt;ref name="Tishler" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/89923/rec/72, Up Against the Bulkhead]&lt;/ref&gt;

===El Toro Marine Air Base===

In July 1970 another chapter formed at the [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro|El Toro Marine air base]] in Orange County, CA. They published a newspaper called ''Pay Back'' consistently until the end of 1970 and then sporadically for another year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/2481/rec/91, Pay Back]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fort Carson===

In mid-1970 a group of GI from the [[Fort Carson]] army base near Colorado Springs, CO began to meet and publish a newspaper called ''Counter Attack''. They were supported by the ''Homefront'' GI coffeehouse. As with all the other chapters, they experienced a high turnover rate and disbanded by mid-1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/86054/rec/18, Counter Attack]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rules==

MDM was more disciplined than most other GI resistance organizations of the period. At a June 1970 regional conference involving chapters from Camp Pendleton, San Diego, the Bay Area, Fort Ord, Long Beach, and El Toro the members approved 16 strict ''Rules for MDM Members''. These included no narcotics or marijuana, no racism, no male chauvinism or sexism, no criminal activity or stealing from the people, putting the interests and needs of the people before personal pleasure, mandatory participation in political education classes, no misuse of funds, and instructions that if arrested members were to give only name, rank, and serial number.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/59671/rec/136 Rules for MDM Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Some critics of MDM have argued that their 12 demands, if implemented "would have rendered the U.S. military totally ineffective as a fighting force."&lt;ref name="Rothrock"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rothrock |first=James |date=2006 |title=Divided We Fall: How Disunity Leads to Defeat |location=Bloomington, IN |publisher=AuthorHouse |pages=228–30 |isbn=1-4259-1107-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in January 1971 in The Marine Corps Gazette, Marine commandant general [[Leonard F. Chapman Jr.]] said MDM was "a serious threat to the defense of this country."&lt;ref name="Parsons" /&gt;

===House Internal Security Committee===

The House Committee on Internal Security investigated MDM and the broader GI movement. They concluded that the GI Movement "is the organized efforts by relatively small numbers of GIs and pseudo pacifist civilians to enlist and engage the participation by United States armed services personnel in the so-called peace movement." A witness before the committee described MDM's efforts at Fort Ord as follows: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The general purpose of the MDM was to recruit soldiers, to propagandize them, to encourage them to file for conscientious objector status, to hold demonstrations enlisting their sympathy against the Army and the establishment, to conduct…certain operations aimed at distributing propaganda literature upon the military reservation illegally, and to disrupt in general and neutralize the effectiveness of Fort Ord as a military training base.&lt;ref name="Rothrock" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other Views===

Other observers agreed that MDM was on the more radical end of the GI movement but were more favorable.&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt; One scholar observed that MDM viewed "the war in a much broader context of military and social oppression that MDM hoped to eradicate. For many groups on the Left, ending the Vietnam conflict was a liberal issue in comparison to the more revolutionary goal of transforming American society. For members of the armed forces facing the prospect of combat in Southeast Asia, ending the war was a critical issue. The MDM demands, framed as they were in broad social and political terms, reflect a strong Left political influence on at least some of the GI antiwar groups."&lt;ref name="Tishler" /&gt; The ''Stanford Daily'' viewed MDM as a lifeline to the GIs: "These men have already suffered the dehumanization process of boot camp and many of them are being prepared for Viet Nam. They were living a nightmare of which there was little relief until MDM developed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hill |first=Penny |date=1970-02-12 |title=Movement for a Democratic Military |work=Stanford Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radicalism===

MDM itself was quite upfront with its radicalism. As the August 1970 ''Right-on Post'' newspaper published at Fort Ord put it: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The goal of MDM as an organization is to educate GIs to the real causes of their oppression, and to help them move to put an end to the problem. Through a black-brown-white coalition, we will educate one another, struggle together and defend one another. Rising as one, with clenched fists, we will break the man's chains. We are not afraid of the man's stockades; we've been there. The Vietnamese freedom fighters have shown us the way: a united force of brothers and sisters determined to free themselves can defeat the U.S. military monster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/2832/rec/43, Right-on Post August 1970 p.12]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Harassment and Attacks==

Several of the MDM chapters and their affiliated GI coffeehouses experienced legal and non-legal harassment from the pro-military towns where they were located and even violent attacks from right-wing organizations. In one instance, the ''Green Machine'' coffeehouse near Camp Pendleton was shot up on April 29, 1970 with 45 caliber machine gun fire, wounding one of the marines inside in the shoulder. A clandestine paramilitary right-wing group called the Secret Army Organization was suspected.&lt;ref name="Cortright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oceanside" /&gt; Another involved the San Diego Chapter on February 8, 1970. According to the lawyer and author Mark Lane, the San Diego Police and Navy Shore Patrol

&lt;blockquote&gt;"smashed down the door of a San Diego store front…to break up a peaceful meeting of Marines, Sailors and civilians." This was preceded by "several hours of terror on the streets in the vicinity by the local and military police during which civilians were threatened and detained by the cops and GI's were taken into custody, physically pushed around and finally arrested on non-existent charges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lane |first=Mark |date=1970-02-13 |title=Cops Attack Anti-war GIs |work=Los Angeles Free Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15932coll8/id/28124/rec/77, MDM Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==

MDM may have been the most radical of the GI antiwar and military resistance organizations of significant size during the Vietnam War. It has been estimated that they had between five thousand and ten thousand members and they had viable chapters in over half-a-dozen military bases and cities.&lt;ref name="Cortright" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Moser" /&gt; Their stand against the Vietnam War, their call for self-determination of all peoples and their opposition to discrimination and racism proved popular with a segment of GI, particularly minority GIs, as was the idea of democratizing the military. The military considered them a serious threat. With the transfer and discharge of many of its most active members, chapters were hard to sustain and by the end of the Vietnam War, MDM's last remaining chapter dissolved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">'''Negative free bid''' is a [[contract bridge]] [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#treatment|treatment]] whereby a [[Glossary of contract bridge terms#freebid|free bid]] by responder over an opponent's overcall shows a long suit in a weak hand and is not forcing. This is in contrast with standard treatment, where a free bid can show unlimited values and is unconditionally forcing. The treatment is a relatively recent invention, and has become quite popular, especially in expert circles.

Negative free bids resolve relatively frequent situations where the responder holds a long suit with which he would like to compete for a partscore, but is deprived from bidding it by opponent's overcall.

==Example==
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"
!width="25%"|West||width="25%"|North||width="25%"|East||width="25%"|South
|- align=center
|||1{{diams}}||1{{spades}}||?
|} 
For example, if South holds:&amp;nbsp;{{BridgeHandInline|86|KJ10852|K6|532}}, partner opens 1{{Diams}} and East overcalls 1{{Spades}}, he couldn't bid 2{{Hearts}} in standard methods, as it would show 10+ [[Hand evaluation|high-card points]], and a [[negative double]] would be too off-shape. With NFB treatment in effect though, he can bid 2{{Hearts}} which the partner may pass (unless he has extra values and support, or an excellent suit of its own without tolerance for hearts).
{{clear}}
However, as a [[corollary]], negative free bids affect the scope of negative double; if the hand is suitable for "standard" forcing free bid (10-11+ points), a negative double has to be made first and the suit bid only in the next round. Thus, the negative double can be made with the following types of hand:
*A weakish hand with unbid suits (unbid major)
*A stronger hand with unbid suits
*A strong (opening bid or more) one-suited hand.
This can sometimes allow the opponents to [[preempt]] effectively. 
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;"
!width="25%"|West||width="25%"|North||width="25%"|East||width="25%"|South
|- align=center
|1{{Diams}}||1{{Hearts}}||Dbl||4{{Hearts}}
|- align=center
|?|| || ||
|} 
For example, West, holding: {{BridgeHandInline|KJ103|J8|AKQ104|J2}}, after this auction is in an awkward situation — he doesn't know whether partner has spades or not; whether South was bidding to make or to [[sacrifice (bridge)|sacrifice]] — is it correct to double, bid 4{{Spades}} or pass?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4948">'''Order''' is the planning of [[time]] and organizing of [[resource]]s, as well as of society.&lt;ref&gt;[[Erving Goffman]], ''Relations in Public'' (1972) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Although order is rarely discussed as a virtue in contemporary society, order is in fact central to improving [[efficiency]], and is at the heart of [[time management]] strategies such as David Allen's ''[[Getting Things Done]]''.

==Emergence==
The valorisation of order in the early stages of commercialization and industrialisation was linked by [[R. H. Tawney]] to Puritan concerns for system and method in 17th-century England.&lt;ref&gt;R. H. Tawney, ''Religion and the Rise of Capitalism'' (1937) p. 193-5&lt;/ref&gt; The same period saw English prose developing the qualities [[Matthew Arnold]] described as "regularity, uniformity, precision, balance".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Deirdre N. McCloskey, ''The Bourgeois Virtues'' (2006) p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

"Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time" is a saying attributed to [[Benjamin Franklin]] in 1730, while he was 20 years old.  It was part of his 13 [[virtue]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Benjamin |last=Franklin |url=http://www.earlyamerica.com/lives/franklin/chapt8/ |title=The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin: Chapter Eight |publisher=earlyamerica.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |first=Ron |last=Kurtus |date=7 February 2005 |url=http://www.school-for-champions.com/character/franklin_virtues.htm |title=Benjamin Franklin's Thirteen Virtues |publisher=school-for-champions.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A darker view of the early modern internalisation of order and discipline was taken by [[Michel Foucault]] in ''The Order of Things'' and ''Discipline and Punish'';&lt;ref&gt;G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2002) p. 97-9&lt;/ref&gt; but for [[Rousseau]] love of order both in nature and in the harmonious psyche of the natural man was one of the tap-roots of moral conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence D. Cooper, ''Rousseau, Nature, and the Problem of the Good Life'' (2006) p. 92-6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romantic reaction==

The [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction against reason, industry and the sober virtues, led to a downgrading of order as well.&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, p. 31-2 and p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; In art, spontaneity took precedence over method and craft;&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''The mirror and the lamp'' (1971) p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; in life, the [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] call of wildness and disorder eclipsed the appeal of ordered sobriety – as with the cultivated disorganization of the [[sixties]] [[hippie]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Hoffman ed., ''Future Visions'' (1996) p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

"Latter-day attempts such as those of [[Deidre McCloskey]] to reclaim the bourgeois virtues like order may be met in some quarters only by laughter."&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==
Sociologists, while noting that praise of order is generally associated with a conservative stance – one that can be traced back through [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Richard Hooker]] to [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;Shelley Burke, ''Virtue Transformed'' (2006) p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; - point out that many taken-for-granted aspects of [[social order]] (such as which side of the road to drive on) produce substantial and equitable advantages for individuals at very little personal cost.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, breakdowns in [[public order]] reveal everyone's daily dependence upon  the smooth functioning of the wider society.&lt;ref&gt;Goffman p. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Durkheim]] saw [[anomie]] as the existential reaction to the ordered disorder of modern society.&lt;ref&gt;John O'Neill, ''Sociology as a Skin Trade'' (1972) p. 181&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
[[Jung]]ians considered orderliness (along with restraint and responsibility) as one of the virtues attributable to the [[senex]] or old man - as opposed to the spontaneous openness of the [[Puer Aeternus|puer]] or eternal youth.&lt;ref&gt;M. Jacoby, ''The Analytic Encounter'' (1984) p. 118&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Freud]] saw the positive traits of orderliness and conscientiousness as rooted in [[anal eroticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th-century examples==
Freud himself was a highly organised personality, ordering his life – at work and play – with the regularity of a timetable.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gay, ''Freud'' (1989) p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Osler]] was another highly successful physician who built his life on a highly organised basis.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You Say After You Say Hello?'' (1974) p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
[[Wallace Stevens]] wrote of the "blessed rage for order" in ''Ideas of Order'' (1936).&lt;ref&gt;Wallace Stevens, ''Collected Poems'' (1984) p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1481">'''Complex perceptions''' like [[speech recognition|voice recognition]] or [[discrimination]] of similar sound sequences need experience and can generally be trained.
Complex perceptions are often multi-[[sensory perception]]s.
Example: To distinguish between a real apple and fake the subject needs to touch or to smell it, because [[visual inspection]] may be insufficient.

Depending on previous experience with similar situations the subject will decide which [[strategy]] to use. Vision-Motor-Perception Program is based on the assumption that vision is the most important sensory mechanism. This program, to help children gain superior perception abilities, was developed based on theory and research in how they develop. &lt;ref&gt; Gould, L. (1997). Visual Perception Training. The Elementary School Journal, 67(7), 381-389. &lt;/ref&gt;

The basic [[principle]]s of ''perception training'' are similar to [[problem solving]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Werner Hunziker, (2006) Im Auge des Lesers: foveale und periphere Wahrnehmung - vom Buchstabieren zur Lesefreude  [In the eye of the reader: foveal and peripheral perception - from letter recognition to the joy of reading] Transmedia Stäubli Verlag Zürich 2006 {{ISBN|978-3-7266-0068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The perception of a simple [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]] (like a sound of a given intensity) can normally not be trained to function below its [[intensity threshold]].

In [[physics]], a '''physical body''' or '''physical object''' (or simply a '''body''' or '''object''') is an [[Identity (philosophy)|identifiable]] collection of [[matter]], which may be constrained by an identifiable boundary, and may move as a unit by translation or rotation, in [[Three-dimensional space|3-dimensional space]].

In common usage, an object is a collection of matter within a defined [[wikt:contiguity|contiguous]] boundary in [[3-dimensional space]]. The boundary must be defined and identified by the properties of the material.  The boundary may change over time.  The boundary is usually the visible or tangible surface of the object.  The matter in the object is constrained (to a greater or lesser degree) to move as one object.  The boundary may move in space relative to other objects that it is not attached to (through translation and rotation).  An object's boundary may also deform and change over time in other ways.

Also in common usage, an object is not constrained to consist of the same collection of [[matter]].  Atoms or parts of an object may change over time.  An object is defined by the simplest representation of the boundary consistent with the observations.  However the laws of Physics only apply directly to objects that consist of the same collection of matter.

Each object has a unique identity, independent of any other properties.  Two objects may be identical, in all properties except position, but still remain distinguishable.  In most cases the boundaries of two objects may not overlap at any point in time.  The property of identity allows objects to be counted.

Examples of [[scientific model|models]] of physical bodies include, but are not limited to a [[particle]], several [[interaction|interacting]] smaller bodies (particles or other), and [[continuous media]].

The common conception of physical objects includes that they have [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]] in the [[universe|physical world]], although there do exist [[physical theory|theories]] of [[quantum physics]] and [[cosmology]] which may challenge{{how|date=June 2013}} this. In modern physics, "extension" is understood in terms of the [[spacetime]]: roughly speaking, it means that for a given moment of [[time]] the body has some location in the space, although not necessarily a [[point (geometry)|point]]. A physical body as a whole is assumed to have such [[physical quantity|quantitative]] properties as [[mass]], [[momentum]], [[electric charge]], other [[Conservation law (physics)|conserving quantities]], and possibly other quantities.

A body with known composition and described in an adequate physical theory is an example of [[physical system]].

==In common usage==

An object is known by the application of [[sense]]s. The properties of an object are inferred by learning and reasoning based on the information perceived.  Abstractly, an object is a construction of our mind consistent with the information provided by our senses, using [[Occam's razor]].

In common usage an object is the material inside the boundary of an object, in 3-dimensional space.  The boundary of an object is a contiguous surface which may be used to determine what is inside, and what is outside an object.  An object is a single piece of material, whose extent is determined by a description based on the properties of the material.  An imaginary sphere of granite within a larger block of granite would not be considered an identifiable object, in common usage.  A fossilized scull encased in a rock may be considered an object because it is possible to determine the extent of the scull based on the properties of the material.

For a [[rigid body]], the boundary of an object may change over time by [[Continuity (mathematics)|continuous]] [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[rotation]].  For a [[deformable body]] the boundary may also be continuously [[Deformation (mechanics)|deformed]] over time in other ways.

An object has an [[Identity (philosophy)|identity]].  In general two objects with identical properties, other than position at an instance in time, may be distinguished as two objects and may not occupy the same space at the same time (excluding component objects).  An object's identity may be tracked using the continuity of the change in its boundary over time.  The identity of objects allows objects to be arranged in [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] and [[counting|counted]].

The material in an object may change over time.  For example, a rock may wear away or have pieces broken off it.  The object will be regarded as the same object after the addition or removal of material, if the system may be more simply described with the continued existence of the object, than in any other way.  The addition or removal of material may discontinuously change the boundary of the object.  The continuation of the objects identity is then based on the description of the system by continued identify being simpler than without continued identity.

For example, a particular car might have all its wheels changed, and still be regarded as the same car.

The identity of an object may not split.  If an object is broken into two pieces at most one of the pieces has the same identity.  An object's identity may also be destroyed if the simplest description of the system at a point in time changes from identifying the object to not identifying it.  Also an object's identity is created at the first point in time that the simplest model of the system consistent with perception identifies it.

An object may be composed of components.  A component is an object completely within the boundary of a containing object.

==Classical mechanics==

In [[classical mechanics]] a physical body is collection of matter having properties including [[mass]], [[velocity]], [[momentum]] and [[energy]].  The matter exists in a volume of [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] space. This space is its [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]].

Under [[Newtonian gravity]] the gravitational field further away than the furthest extent of an object is determined only by the mass and the position of the center of mass.

Interactions between objects are partly described by orientation and external shape.

In [[continuum mechanics]] an object may be described as a collection of sub objects, down to an infinitesimal division, which interact with each other by forces which may be described internally by [[pressure]] and [[Stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]].

== Quantum mechanics ==

In [[quantum mechanics]] an object is a particle or collection of particles.  Until measured, a particle does not have a physical position. A particle is defined by a [[Wave function|probability distribution]] of finding the particle at a particular position.  There is a [[Uncertainty principle|limit to the accuracy with which the position and velocity may be measured]].  A particle or collection of particles is described by a [[quantum state]].

These ideas vary from the common usage understanding of what an object is.

== String theory ==

In [[particle physics]], there is a debate as to whether some [[elementary particle]]s are not bodies, but are [[point (geometry)|points]] without [[Extension (metaphysics)|extension]] in [[physical space]] within [[space-time]], or are always extended in at least one dimension of space as in [[string theory]] or [[M theory]].

==In psychology==
In some branches of [[psychology]], depending on [[school of thought]], a physical body is a [[physical object]] with [[physical properties]], as compared to [[mental objects]].  In ([[reductionistic]]) [[behaviorism]], a physical body and its properties are the (only) [[meaningful]] objects of study.
While in the modern day behavioral psychotherapy it is still only the means for goal oriented behavior modifications, in [[Body Psychotherapy]] it is not a means only anymore, but its felt sense is a goal of its own. In [[cognitive psychology]], physical bodies as they occur in [[biology]] are studied in order to understand the [[mind]], which may not be a physical body, as in [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalist]] schools of thought.

==In philosophy==
{{Further|Ontology|Metaphysics}}

A physical body is an enduring object that exists throughout a particular [[trajectory]] of [[space]] and orientation over a particular duration of [[time]], and which is located in  the [[physical world|world]] of [[physical space]] (i.e., as studied by [[physics]]).  This contrasts with [[abstract object]]s such as [[mathematical object]]s which do not exist at any particular time or place.
Examples are a [[cloud]], a [[human body]], a weight, a billiard ball, a table, or a [[proton]].  This is contrasted with [[abstract object]]s such as [[mental object]]s, which exist in the [[mental world]], and [[mathematical object]]s. Other examples that are '''''not''''' [[physical bodies]] are [[emotions]], the concept of "[[justice]]", a feeling of hatred, or the [[number]] "3".  In some philosophies, like the [[Idealism]] of [[George Berkeley]], a physical body '''''is''''' a [[mental object]], but still has extension in the space of a visual field.

'''Presumption of guilt''', in Latin, ''ei incumbit probatio qui negat, non qui dicit'' (the burden of proof is on the one who denies, not on one who declares), is the principle that one is considered guilty unless proven innocent. Generally, this is an [[argument from ignorance]], a philosophical concept in which a thing is assumed to be true because not proved false.

==In the law==

Presumption of guilt shifts the [[burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] onto the defendant, who must then [[Burden of proof (philosophy)#Proving a negative|prove a negative]] to achieve [[acquittal]]. The phrase has been in use since at least the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;
T. C. Granger. ''A digest of the law of evidence in criminal cases'' W. Benning &amp; Company, 1846&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Default effect|default position]] based on pessimism and [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] whereas [[presumption of innocence]] is based more on optimism and [[Trust (emotion)|trust]]. There is a greater likelihood of obtaining a [[wrongful conviction]]. For example, in the [[murder of Lynette White]] case, a double wrong was committed in that innocent men were convicted, while the real perpetrator remained at large and a danger to the public.

Presumption of guilt is a denial of an international [[human right]] under the UN's [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Article 11. Under the presumption of guilt, the defence must collect and present compelling evidence to the [[trier of fact]] (a judge or a jury). The defence must, in most cases prove that the accused is innocent.

==Widespread prevalence==
Presumption of guilt is pandemic, occasionally erupting into epidemic proportions. Smaller instances include adverse accusatory reactions to unusual costume such as the [[burqa]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Angela Rainey]], 'Here's what happens when you wear a burka in Northern Ireland towns', The Belfast Telegraph, 7 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; or merely a 'suspicious stare' from the police.&lt;ref&gt;[[John P Crank]], ''Understanding Police Culture'', Routledge, p 146&lt;/ref&gt; More severe is the [[blame culture]] inherent in bureaucratic organisations where those with the least responsibility are blamed the most.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Belief in the '[[Stab-in-the-back myth]]' – that Jews and profiteers were collectively guilty of losing the war for Germany in 1918 – is an extreme instance of guilt being presumed.

==Typology==

Presumption of guilt may take many forms: 
* [[Guilt by association]], for example, punishing the families of North Korean defectors.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Laurence and Ju-Min Park, 'Guilty by association: growing up in hell of North Korean gulag', Reuters, may 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Extrajudicial punishment]] such as [[lynching]] or other forms of [[vigilantism]], which seek to bypass legal procedures;
* [[Blaming the victim]]; for example, victims of rape in Saudi Arabia and Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vicky Baker]], 'Rape victim sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in jail', The Guardian, 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Neela Debnath]], 'rape victims still blamed for sexual violence in Somalia', The Independent, 6 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Collective guilt]], for example the belief that 'all Muslims are terrorists';&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer Case]], 'Islamist Terror and Collective Guilt', [[national Review]], 4 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; conversely, the terrorist may believe his victims to be collectively guilty of some perceived injustice, as in the case of [[9/11]]. A belief in [[Jewish deicide]] expresses the view that 'all Jews are Christ-killers',&lt;ref&gt;Peter J Tomson, ''Presumed Guilty: How the Jews were Blamed For the Death of Jesus'', Fortress Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; though in fact only the Romans had the legal authority to crucify someone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giles Fraser]], 'Christians must understand that for Jews the cross is a symbol of oppression', [[The Guardian]], 25 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rushing to [[judgement]], for example equating arrest with conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luke Gittos]], '[[Eric Bellquist]] and the presumption of innocence', ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', 2017-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;
* The obtaining of a [[false confession]] under [[duress]] or [[torture]]; 
* [[Judicial misconduct]] such as [[collusion]] with the prosecution; [[judicial murder]]
* A [[frameup]], usually admissions presumably made, "false statements". All such admissions should be treated with skepticism without actual video or a signed statement.[[miscarriage of justice]]; 
* A [[plea bargain]], which in the worst case may induce a guilty party to give [[false testimony]] against an innocent co-accused;
* A [[fixed penalty notice]] or on-the-spot fine; 
* [[Precrime]] policies such as [[preventive detention]]
* Preemptive action such as [[drone strikes]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Robertson|title=Drone attacks go against every human rights principle in the book|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/lifestyle/2012/06/drone-attacks-against-human-rights-principle-book|work=New Statesman|date=13 June 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

* [[Racial prejudice]];&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Stevenson, 'A presumption of guilt', [[The New York Review]], 13 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[authority fallacy]], demonstrated by the [[Milgram experiment]], in which persons may be too much inclined to follow orders from a perceived [[authoritarian]] figure; as in the extreme case of [[Hitler]], [[Adolf Eichmann]], and the [[Final solution]].
* Short-term political gain and the destruction of political rivals, as in the [[Stalinist]] [[show trials]] of the 1930s.
* Dissatisfaction or impatience with due [[legal process]] which [[vigilantes]] and others see as 'weak'.
* 'Impatience and fear of jurors, 'media frenzy', a punitive culture, and cognitive bias'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Findley]], 'The presumption of Innocence exists in theory, not reality', [[Washington Post]], 19/1/2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2018}}
* Psychological game-playing; the aggressive accuser is said to play [[mind games]], while the victim is on a [[guilt trip]]. Guilt feelings may be residual from early childhood, in which all of us are powerless and presumption of guilt ('you naughty boy', 'shame on you, wicked child') is often the norm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne Dyer]], ''[[Your Erroneous Zones]]'', Warner Books, 1976, p 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Berne]], ''[[Games People Play (book)]]'', Penguin 1964, pp 73-75&lt;/ref&gt;
* A mind-set which favours [[Apocalypticism]]. According to [[Jonathan Schell]], the religiously orthodox may 'take it upon themselves to please a wrathful God' through the 'extinction of 'evil' mankind'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Schell]], ''[[The Fate of the Earth]]'', Picador, 1982, p133&lt;/ref&gt; Apocalypticism attracts 'desperate, humiliated and defeated' people, says [[John Michael Greer]]; it 'offers a free ticket out of the troubles of everyday life'.&lt;ref&gt;John Michael Greer, ''Apocalypse'', Quercus, 2012, pp 35, 36, 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Presumption of guilt is as old as [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] itself. In ancient Greece, public officials were elected for very limited terms of office and barred from re-election, on the presumption that too long an incumbency would lead to abuse of power. [[Thucydides]] and [[Aristophanes]]&lt;ref&gt;M S Silk, ''Aristophanes and the Definition of Comedy'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p 372&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the crowd were too easily swayed by [[Eloquence|oratory]]  and emotion. As [[Lord Acton]] wrote in the 19th century, again expressing presumption of guilt, "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men,..."&lt;ref name="lmcone"&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165acton.html Letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton, April 5, 1887] published in ''Historical Essays and Studies'', edited by J. N. Figgis and R. V. Laurence (London: Macmillan, 1907)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]] was a persistent presumer of guilt in those he disliked. Being allegedly a [[psychopath]] and [[narcissist]]&lt;ref&gt;see Wikipedia article [[psychopathography of Adolf Hitler]]&lt;/ref&gt; he tended to blame others when things went wrong. From 1918 he blamed Germany's defeat on the [[November criminals]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] for negotiating a truce when Germany still had the capacity to fight on; in [[Mein Kampf]] he wrote; 'every third German is a traitor'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Phoenix 2003, p 154&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, when it was clear that Germany could not win the war, Hitler wished to punish the entire nation for failing to meet his expectations, according to [[Sebastian Haffner]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Phoenix 2003, p 120, 157, 160, 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1947 and 1956, many US citizens were unfairly accused of being communist agents or sympathisers and had their careers ruined during the era of [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Second Red Scare]], or even killed like [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]]. The McCarthyites 'never produced a single Communist spy whose guilt was proved in court.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Don E Carleton]] and [[John Henry Faulk]], ''Red Scare: Right-Wing Hysteria, Fifties Fanaticism, and Their Legacy in Texas'', University of Texas Press, 2014, p x&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], supreme leader of [[Iran]], pronounced a death sentence by [[fatwa]] on [[Salman Rushdie]] and anyone assisting publication of his book, ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''; 'I call on all Muslims wherever they may be in the world to kill them without delay'. the Fatwa was condemned for violating [[national sovereignty]], [[freedom of speech]], and the Muslim principle of [[fiqh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Newsweek]], 27 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK case ''Hale'', 2 P. C. 290 (n), the defendant was alleged to have murdered his niece, who had cried out 'good uncle do not kill me', and then was seen no more. The defendant, asked to produce the girl in court, had fraudulently produced another girl disguised as the niece. The court presumed him guilty on this basis and he was executed. Later, the niece was found, alive and well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=TC | last=Granger | title=A Digest of the Law of Evidence in Criminal Cases | publisher=Benning and co | year=1846 | page=18 | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ifFiAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA18&amp;lpg=RA1-PA18&amp;dq=Hale,+2P.C.290(n)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WCEInjyO8T&amp;sig=vdmOWhomV6cRdpLo4JCG7pkCPVY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8-LyF5ZPZAhWywVkKHbOrCZ0Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hale%2C%202P.C.290(n)&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American actor and producer [[Jeremy Piven]] has spoken out against the [[Me Too movement]], which, he claims, 'put lives in jeopardy without a hearing, due process or evidence'. Writing about Piven's comment, journalist [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]], suggests that the presumption of innocence, which barrister and writer [[John Mortimer]] described as a 'golden thread', is being weakened.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)]], 'Whatever Happened to the Presumption of Innocence?', ''Los Angeles Times'', 16 November 2017.

High Court judge Sir [[Richard Henriques]] has criticized UK police training and methods which allegedly assert that 'only 0.1% of rape allegations are false' ('lying with statistics' or straight-out lie to prejudice, this is better than 'accusers never lie', which is obviously false.) and in which all complainants are treated as 'victims' from the start. In three cases which later collapsed, including those of Liam Allan and Danny Kay, police withheld vital evidence from the defence. &lt;ref&gt;[[Marco Giannangeli]], 'Police must stop training 'Presumption of Guilt', says High Court judge', Daily Express, 24 December 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24713">The '''problem of mental causation''' is a conceptual issue in the [[philosophy of mind]]. That problem, in short, is how to account for the common-sense idea that intentional thoughts or [[intentional mental states]] are causes of intentional actions. The problem divides into several distinct sub-problems, including the problem of causal exclusion, the problem of anomalism, and the problem of externalism. However, the sub-problem which has attracted most attention in the philosophical literature is arguably the exclusion problem.

== Description ==

The basic problem of mental causation is an intuitive one: on the face of it, it seems that mental events cause physical events (and vice versa), but how can mental events have any causal effect on physical events? Suppose, for example, some person, John, orders dessert after dinner. It seems that at least one cause for such a physical, behavioral event is that John desired to have dessert and believed that by ordering dessert he would be able to soon have dessert. But, how can such mental events as beliefs and desires cause John's mouth to move in such a way that he orders dessert?

== Sub-problems of mental causation ==

=== Exclusion problem ===
What follows is a summary of the causal exclusion problem in its simplest form, and it is merely one of several possible formulations.

To the extent that we do ''not'' have to go outside human physiology in order to trace the causal antecedents of any bodily movement, intentional action can be fully causally explained by the existence of these physiological antecedents ''alone''. No mention of mental states need enter into the explanation. This troubles philosophers because intuitively it seems that mental states are crucial in causing a person to act (for example, their beliefs and desires). But, given that physiological facts are sufficient to account for action, mental states appear to be superfluous; they are at risk of being causally and explanatorily irrelevant with respect to human action {{harv|Yoo|2006|p=§3b.iii}}.

Many philosophers consider this apparent irrelevance to be a highly counter-intuitive and undesirable position to take. It ultimately leads to [[epiphenomenalism]]—the view that mental events or states are causally irrelevant, they are merely after effects that play no role in any causal chains whatsoever. Thomas Huxley famously noted that epiphenomenalism treats mental states like the steam coming off a train: it plays no causal role in the train's moving forward, it is merely an "emergent property" of the actual causation occurring in the engine {{harv|Walter|2003|p= §2}}.

=== Problem of anomalism ===
Another problem with mental causation is that mental events seem anomalous in the sense that there are no scientific laws that mental states can figure into without having exceptions. There are no "strict" laws, and mental events must factor into strict laws in order to fit respectably into the causal order described by current science [see {{harv|Davidson| 1970}}].

In short, one response has been to deny that psychological laws involving mental states require strict, exceptionless laws. Jerry Fodor argues that non-basic (or "special") sciences do not in fact require strict laws {{harv|Fodor|1980}}. In current practice, special sciences (for example, biology and chemistry) have ''ceteris paribus'' laws (or laws with "all else being equal" clauses), according to which there are exceptions. However, only in the basic sciences (physics) are there strict, exceptionless laws. Thus, although mental states are anomalous, they can still figure into scientifically respectable laws of psychology.

=== Problem of externalism ===
In the latter half of the twentieth century externalism about meaning became espoused by many philosophers. Externalism is roughly the view that certain parts of an individual's environment play a crucial role in the meaning of at least some of an individual's words [see {{harv|Putnam| 1975}} and {{harv|Burge|1979}}]. A thesis about meaning affects the mind insofar as our thoughts are ''about'' things in the world. A common view in the philosophy of mind is that at least certain mental states have intentional content in this sense. For example, one's belief that water is wet has the semantic content of ''water is wet''. The thought is about water and the fact that it is wet. But, if externalism is true—if some of the contents of one's thoughts are constituted at least in part by factors external to one's mind—then there is yet another difficulty in explaining how mental states can cause physical states {{harv|Yoo|2006|p=§3b.ii}}].

== Commonsensical Solutions ==


===Causal Exclusion Counter-Argument=== 

Causal exclusion is only a problem for mental causation if you are an advocate for physicalism.  I will begin with Jaegwon Kim’s causal exclusion argument which states that if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes, and no physical effects are caused twice over by distinct physical and mental causes, there cannot be any irreducible mental causes (Kallestrup 2006).  First of all, the antecedent of the causal exclusion argument is the definition of physicalism.  Kim states that if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes. This statement alone negates dualism, idealism and mental causation.  Whereas, it is redundant to state the remaining of the causal exclusion argument because if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes, then no physical effects would be caused twice over by any substance other than physical.  Also, if all physical effects have sufficient physical causes, then there clearly would not be any reducible or irreducible mental causes.  Secondly, if a person does not support physicalism, then they are not going to support the view that all physical effects have sufficient physical causes.  Lastly, physicalism is the hypothesis that the mind is the same as the brain and/or the mental supervenes on the physical, yet it is not fact.  Therefore, to use the hypothesis of causal exclusion as evidence to counter mental causation is no different than using "the popper's three world formulation" or "psychological nativism" (as shown in this section) to support mental causation.

===The Advent of Crying===

It is an arduous task to prove mental causation within the realms of a physical body.  Yet, every human has witnessed mental causation within the human body.  Let us view the advent of crying.  Crying is a physical effect coupled with either a physical cause or a mental (emotional) cause.  There are three types of tears: basal tears, reflex tears, and emotional tears (Hoyt 2008).  Basal tears keep our eyes from drying out, reflex tears are in response to eye irritants (physical causation), and emotional tears are a result of mental causation such as sadness, joy, etc (Hoyt 2008).  I am going to focus on the latter, emotional tears.  Once sadness is registered in the cerebrum, the endocrine system releases hormones to the ocular area, and tears are formed (Hoyt 2008).  Crying due to one's mental state is an event that is common across all cultures and demographics.  Whether we cry due to sadness or joy, these are all events that have their origination in mental causation.  It would be inhuman to claim otherwise.

How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain by Lisa Feldman Barrett for a rigorous discussion. One’s crying is not planned, unless one is an actor, then we are able to tap into the mechanism that causes tears to flow. Otherwise it just happens outside of out awareness of causing it by thinking. The brain has patterns of neurons that once activated generate physiologic responses that happens up to 10 seconds before we are aware. (Koch, Christof. 2012. “How Physics and Neuroscience Dictate Your “Free” Will”.  Scientific American:  April 12.) and many others.

==Traditional Solutions==

=== Dualist solutions ===
{{Main article|Philosophy of mind|Dualism (philosophy of mind)}}

Some have claimed that while the mental and the physical are quite different things, they can nonetheless causally interact with one another, a view going back to Descartes [{{harv|Descartes| 1642/1986}}, especially meditations II &amp; VI]. This view is known as ''[[interactionist dualism]]''. The major problem that interactionist dualism faces is that of explicating a satisfactory notion of causation according to which non-spatial events, such as mental events, can causally interact with physical events. According to the current mainstream scientific world-view, the physical realm is [[Causal closure|''causally closed'']], in that causal relationships only hold among physical events in the physical realm. Given these types of considerations, some argue that it is appropriate to say that the main assumptions in interactionist dualism generate the problem of mental causation rather than solve it (see {{harv|Yoo| 2006|p=§1a}}.

=== Physicalist solutions ===
{{Main article|Physicalism}}
{{See also|Monism}}

The other major option is to assert that mental events are either (at least contingently) identical to physical events, or [[Supervenience|supervene]] on physical events. Views that fall under this general heading are called [[physicalism]] or [[materialism]]. But, such views require a particular theory to explain how mental events are physical in nature. One such theory is [[behaviorism]]. Behaviorists, in general, argue that mental events are merely dispositions to behave in certain ways. Another theory is the [[identity theory of mind|identity theory]], according to which mental events are (either type- or token-) identical to physical events. A more recent view, known as [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], claims that mental events are individuated (or constituted by) the causal role they play. As such, mental events would fit directly into the causal realm, as they are simply certain causal (or functional) roles. Finally, there is [[eliminative materialism]], which simply denies that there are any such mental events; thus, there is really no problem of mental causation at all.

=== Idealism-Related solutions ===


==== Popper's three-world formulation ====
Related to [[#Dualist solutions|dualism]] above, a more general and somewhat differently posed approach to mental causation is provided by [[Popper's three worlds|Karl Popper's three worlds]]. [[Karl Popper|Popper]] split the world into three categories:&lt;ref name=Popper/&gt;
# The world of physical [[object (philosophy)|object]]s and [[event (philosophy)|event]]s, including [[biology|biological]] entities
# The mental or psychological world, the world of our feelings of pain and of pleasure, of our thoughts, of our decisions, of our perceptions and our observations; in other words, the world of mental or psychological states or processes, or of subjective experiences.
# The world of products of the human mind, including art, science, and religion.

World 3 includes physical theory as a particular case. But World 3 is a creation of the human imagination, and such acts of imagination are a part of World 2. Accordingly, one could argue that the physical notion of causality is a child of the imagination, and although causation has its successes in describing World 1, it may not apply to World 2 or World 3. The subjective aspects of theories contained in World 3 are not readily framed within the third-person perspective of science used to explain World 1.

From this perspective, it is hubris to suppose that the methods successful in describing World 1, in particular to suppose the notions of ''cause'' and ''effect'', invented by World 2 in its creation of the theory of World 3 used to explain World 1, have direct application to Worlds 2 and 3 themselves, and control mental agency.

==== Psychological nativism ====
A still different approach to mental causation is based upon the philosophies of Kant, Chomsky and Pinker. These philosophers stress the impact of built-in aspects of mind, studied in the field of [[psychological nativism]].&lt;ref name=Nativism/&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) pointed out that we all shape our experience of things through the filter of our mind, a view sometimes called [[epistemological solipsism]]. The mind shapes that experience, and among other things, Kant believed the concepts of ''space'' and ''time'' were programmed into the human brain, as was the notion of ''cause'' and ''effect''.&lt;ref name= Warburton0/&gt; We never have ''direct'' experience of things, the ''noumenal'' world, and what we do experience is the ''phenomenal'' world as conveyed by our senses, this conveyance processed by the machinery of the mind and nervous system. Kant focused upon this processing. Kant believed in [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] knowledge arrived at independent of experience, so-called ''synthetic'' ''a priori'' knowledge. In particular, he thought that by introspection some aspects of the filtering mechanisms of the mind/brain/nervous system could be discovered.&lt;ref name= Warburton0/&gt; The following observations summarize Kant's views upon the subject-object problem, called [[Copernican Revolution (metaphor)#The .22Copernican Revolution in philosophy.22|Kant's Copernican revolution]]: 
{{quote|"It has hitherto been assumed that our cognition must conform to the objects; but all attempts to ascertain anything about these objects ''a priori'', by means of conceptions, and thus to extend the range of our knowledge, have been rendered abortive by this assumption. Let us then make the experiment whether we may not be more successful in metaphysics, if we assume that the objects must conform to our cognition. This appears, at all events, to accord better with the possibility of our gaining the end we have in view, that is to say, of arriving at the cognition of objects ''a priori'', of determining something with respect to these objects, before they are given to us. We here propose to do just what Copernicus did in attempting to explain the celestial movements. When he found that he could make no progress by assuming that all the heavenly bodies revolved round the spectator, he reversed the process, and tried the experiment of assuming that the spectator revolved, while the stars remained at rest. We may make the same experiment with regard to the intuition of objects."&lt;ref name=Critique/&gt;|Immanuel Kant|English translation by [[J. M. D. Meiklejohn]] of ''The Critique of Pure Reason'' (1781)}}
Although Kant has posed the issue of built-in aspects of mind, the particulars that depend upon the science of his day have become outmoded. A more recent approach to these limitations is proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Steven Pinker]]. Like Kant, [[Noam Chomsky]] raised the issue of the mind's inherent programming. Chomsky selected as a particular example the acquiring of language by children.&lt;ref name=Nativism/&gt; Of course, language is indispensable in the formulation and communication of our perceptions of the objective world:
{{quote|"People do not think in English or Chinese or Apache; they think in a language of thought. This language of thought probably looks a bit like all these languages;...But compared with any given language, mentalese must be richer in some ways and simpler in others."&lt;ref name=Pinker/&gt;|Steven Pinker|The Language Instinct,  p. 72}} 
Chomsky marshaled evidence that a child's rapid mastery of the complexity of language indicated an innate ability programmed into the development of the human mind from birth that could not be explained by the [[Tabula rasa|"blank slate"]] view of the infant mind. Rather, the mind has a built-in propensity to process symbolic representations. The origins of this ability were sought by [[Steven Pinker]] in a [[Survival of the fittest|Darwinian struggle]] that established the survival value of the ability to communicate.&lt;ref name=Pinker/&gt;  According to Pinker, [[Charles Darwin]] himself "concluded that language ability is 'an instinctive tendency to acquire an art', a design that is not peculiar to humans but seen in other species such as song-learning birds." This observation is strongly supported by [[Crow#Behavior|research on crows]].&lt;ref name=Nature/&gt;

This work can be taken to suggest that although a physical theory is an intermediary between our observations and our notions of connections between them, it is an elaborate mental construction that is a meld of the way the mind works and objective observations. Although a physical theory is used to determine connections about objective events,  the specific form of the theoretical construct is a product of subjective activities, and this particular form may well involve the workings of the brain. Perhaps some aspects of the universe's operation can be expressed in terms of mental constructs, but this process is analogous with the expression of a [[computer algorithm]] in terms of [[assembly language]] instructions peculiar to a particular computer, a translation by a [[compiler]] of the general statement of an algorithm into specific tiny steps that particular computer can handle.&lt;ref name=Edelman/&gt;

From this standpoint, as with the philosophy of Kant, the first-person active actions of mental causation may involve innate workings of the brain itself.

The '''race of the future''' is a theoretical composite [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] which will result from ongoing [[racial admixture]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Conniff, "[http://www.yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2012_05/feature_eugenics.html God and White Men at Yale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028042755/http://yalealumnimagazine.com/issues/2012_05/feature_eugenics.html |date=28 October 2012 }}", ''Yale Alumni Magazine'', May/June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]] in 1925 in ''Practical Idealism'' predicted: "The man of the future will be of mixed race. Today's races and classes will gradually disappear owing to the vanishing of space, time, and prejudice. The [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]]-[[Negroid]] race of the future will replace the diversity of peoples with a diversity of individuals."&lt;ref&gt;''Praktischer Idealismus'', Wien/Leipzig 1925, pages 20, 23, 50&lt;/ref&gt; The same scenario had been envisaged, with rather less enthusiasm, by [[Madison Grant]] in his 1916 ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'', calling for a [[eugenics]] program to prevent this development, and in a similar ideological context in [[Lothrop Stoddard]]'s ''[[The Rising Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy]]'' in 1920.

==History==
[[Gottfried de Purucker]] was an author and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] who, when asked about [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]] in 1930, said "In answering your question very briefly, I can say simply this, that the time has not come when I would willingly suggest intermarriage; but I am in honesty bound to qualify that by saying that the race of the future will be a composite, composed of the many different races on earth today. Let us also remember that all men are ultimately of one blood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/dialogue/dial13.htm|title=KTMG Papers: Thirteen|work=The Dialogues of G. de Purucker|publisher=Theosophical University Press|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''miscegenation'' was used in an anonymous propaganda pamphlet printed in [[New York City]] in late 1863, entitled [[Miscegenation hoax|''Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of the Races, Applied to the American White Man and Negro''.]] The pamphlet purported to be in favor of [[interbreeding]] of whites and [[Black people|blacks]] until the races were indistinguishably mixed as [[mulatto]]s, claiming that this was the goal of the [[United States Republican Party]]. The real authors were [[David Goodman Croly]], managing editor of the ''[[New York World]]'', a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] paper, and [[George Wakeman]], a ''World'' reporter. The pamphlet soon was exposed as an attempt to discredit the Republicans, the [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] administration, and the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist movement]] by exploiting the fears and racial biases common among whites. Nonetheless, this pamphlet and variations on it were reprinted widely in communities on both sides of the [[American Civil War]] by opponents of Republicans.

The British colony of [[Maryland]] was the first to pass an anti-miscegenation law (1664).&lt;ref name="Pascoe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hnn.us/articles/4708.html|title=Why the Ugly Rhetoric Against Gay Marriage Is Familiar to this Historian of Miscegenation | last=Pascoe | first=Peggy | authorlink=Peggy Pascoe | date=2004-04-19 | work=History News Network | publisher=George Mason University | accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 18th, 19th, and early 20th century, many American states passed [[anti-miscegenation laws]], often based on controversial interpretations of the [[Bible]], particularly the story of [[Phinehas, son of Eleazar|Phinehas]]. Typically a [[felony]], these laws prohibited the solemnization of weddings between persons of different races and prohibited the officiating of such ceremonies. Sometimes the individuals attempting to marry would not be held guilty of miscegenation itself, but felony charges of [[adultery]] or [[fornication]] would be brought against them instead. Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Alaska, Hawaii, and the federal District of Columbia did not pass anti-miscegenation laws. In 1883, the constitutionality of anti-miscegenation laws was upheld by the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=106&amp;invol=583 Pace v. Alabama]''.

In 1948, the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] in ''[[Perez v. Sharp]]'' effectively repealed the California anti-miscegenation statutes, thereby making California the first state in the twentieth century to do so. In 1967, the remaining anti-miscegenation laws in 16 states were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]''.

==Multiracial populations==
===Brazil===
In [[Brazil]], as much as 44% of the population classify themselves as [[Pardo Brazilians|Pardo]] (multiracial).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/bda/tabela/protabl.asp?c=262&amp;i=P&amp;nome=on&amp;notarodape=on&amp;tab=262&amp;unit=0&amp;pov=3&amp;opc1=1&amp;poc2=1&amp;OpcTipoNivt=1&amp;opn1=2&amp;nivt=0&amp;orc86=3&amp;poc1=1&amp;orp=6&amp;qtu3=27&amp;opv=1&amp;poc86=2&amp;sec1=0&amp;opc2=1&amp;pop=1&amp;opn2=0&amp;orv=2&amp;orc2=5&amp;qtu2=5&amp;sev=93&amp;sev=1000093&amp;opc86=1&amp;sec2=0&amp;opp=1&amp;opn3=0&amp;sec86=0&amp;sec86=2776&amp;sec86=2777&amp;sec86=2779&amp;sec86=2778&amp;sec86=2780&amp;sec86=2781&amp;ascendente=on&amp;sep=43344&amp;orn=1&amp;qtu7=9&amp;orc1=4&amp;qtu1=1&amp;cabec=on&amp;pon=1&amp;OpcCara=44&amp;proc=1&amp;opn7=0&amp;decm=99 "População residente, por cor ou raça, situação e sexo."] IBGE - PNAD.&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically a mix of White, Black and Native American.

===United States===
[[William Quan Judge]] was a 19th century theosophist who wrote in his book [http://www.phx-ult-lodge.org/aechoes.htm Echoes from the Orient]; "We are preparing here in America a new race which will exhibit the perfection of the glories that I said were being slowly brought to the surface from the long forgotten past ... Here, and nowhere else, are to be found men and women of every race living together, being governed together, attacking nature and the problems of life together, and bringing forth children who combine, each one, two races. This process will go on until in the course of many generations there will be produced on the American continents an entirely new race; new bodies; new orders of intellect; new powers of the mind."

In the United States, the proportion of [[multiracial American]] children is growing. Interracial partnerships are rising, as are transracial [[adoption]]s. In 1990, about 14% of 18- and 19-year-olds, 12% of 20- and 21-year-olds, and 7% of 34- and 35-year-olds were involved in interracial [[Intimate relationship|relationship]]s (Joyner and Kao, 2005). &lt;ref name="Lang"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Nov05/interracial.couples.ssl.html|title=Interracial relationships are on the increase in U.S., but decline with age, Cornell study finds|last=Lang|first=Susan S.|date=2005-11-02|work=Chronicle Online|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2008-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 in the United States, 15% of new marriages were interracial, with 9% of whites, 17% of blacks, 26% of Hispanics and 28% of Asians married outside of their race. Of the 275,000 new interracial marriages in 2010, 43% were white-[[mestizo]], 14.4% were white-Asian, 11.9% were white-black and the rest were other combinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204880404577226981780914906?mod=WSJ_hp_LEFTTopStories|title=More Marriages Cross Race, Ethnicity Lines|work=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other views==
According to [[anthropologist]] [[Henry Harpending]], human populations are actually diverging from one another, as opposed to melding into a single population. Harpending stated "Human races are evolving away from each other ... Genes are evolving fast in Europe, Asia and Africa, but almost all of these are unique to their continent of origin. We are getting less alike, not merging into a single, mixed humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news116529402.html|title=Are humans evolving faster? Findings suggest we are becoming more different, not alike|work=physorg.com|publisher=Physorg.com|accessdate=2012-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4118">The '''sacred–profane dichotomy''' is an idea posited by [[France|French]] [[Sociology|sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]], who considered it to be the central characteristic of [[religion]]: "religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to ''sacred things'', that is to say, things set apart and forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;Emile Durkheim, ''The elementary forms of Religious Life'', ed. and trans. by Karen E. Fields. (New York: The Free Press, 1995), p. 35.[http://home.ku.edu.tr/~mbaker/cshs503/durkheimreligiouslife.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In Durkheim's theory, the [[Sacred (comparative religion)|sacred]] represented the interests of the group, especially unity, which were embodied in sacred group symbols, or ''[[totems]]''. The [[profanum|profane]], on the other hand, involved mundane individual concerns. Durkheim explicitly stated that the sacred–profane dichotomy was not equivalent to [[good and evil|good/evil]]. The sacred could be good or evil, and the profane could be either as well.&lt;ref&gt;Pals 1996, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

Durkheim's claim of the universality of this dichotomy for all religions/[[cult]]s has been criticized by scholars such as British [[anthropologist]] [[Jack Goody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p35161/mobile/ch06s03.html|title=The sacred-profane distinction is not universal|last=|first=|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2007-07-10|work=}} quote: "neither do the [[Lo Dagaa]] [group in Gonja, ''editor note''] appear to have any concepts at all equivalent to the vaguer and not unrelated dichotomy between the sacred and the profane"&lt;/ref&gt; Goody also noted that "many societies have no words that translate as sacred or profane and that ultimately, just like the distinction between natural and supernatural, it was very much a product of [[European religious thought]] rather than a universally applicable criterion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/11183/Sacred-Profane-Durkheim-s-Critics.html |title=Sacred and Profane - Durkheim's Critics |accessdate=2007-07-10 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Tomoko Masuzawa explains in ''The Invention of World Religions: Or, How European Universalism Was Preserved in the Language of Pluralism'', this system of comparative religion privileged Christianity at the expense of non-Christian systems (2005). Any cosmology without a sacred/profane binary was rendered invisible by the field of religious studies, because the binary was supposed to be 'universal'.

The value of social consumerism is that it takes the responsibility of the [[charitable donation]] away from the consumer and ties the philanthropic action to what consumers do naturally (e.g. eat out and part of the tab goes to a food charity.)

[[File:Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.jpg|right|thumb|''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' (1907), also by Picasso in a different style ("[[Picasso's African Period]]") four years later.]]In the [[visual arts]], '''style''' is a "...distinctive manner which permits the grouping of works into related categories"&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Fernie|Fernie, Eric]]. ''Art History and its Methods: A critical anthology''. London: Phaidon, 1995, p. 361. {{ISBN|978-0-7148-2991-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "...any distinctive, and therefore recognizable, way in which an act is performed or an artifact made or ought to be performed and made".&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 150&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the visual appearance of a work of art that relates it to other works by the same artist or one from the same period, training, location, "school", [[art movement]] or [[archaeological culture]]: "The notion of style has long been the art historian's principal mode of classifying works of art. By style he selects and shapes the history of art".&lt;ref&gt;[[George Kubler]] summarizing the view of [[Meyer Schapiro]] (with whom he disagrees), quoted by Alpers in Lang, 138&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Style is often divided into the general style of a period, country or cultural group, group of artists or [[art movement]], and the individual style of the artist within that group style. Divisions within both types of styles are often made, such as between "early", "middle" or "late".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 1&lt;/ref&gt; In some artists, such as [[Picasso]] for example, these divisions may be marked and easy to see, in others they are more subtle.  Style is seen as usually dynamic, in most periods always changing by a gradual process, though the speed of this varies greatly, between the very slow development in style typical of [[prehistoric art]] or [[Ancient Egyptian art]] to the rapid changes in [[Modern art]] styles. Style often develops in a series of jumps, with relatively sudden changes followed by periods of slower development.

After dominating academic discussion in [[art history]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries, so-called "style art history" has come under increasing attack in recent decades, and many art historians now prefer to avoid stylistic classifications where they can.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; Kubler in Lang, 163–164; Alpers in Lang, 137–138; 161&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Any piece of art is in theory capable of being analysed in terms of style; neither periods nor artists can avoid having a style, except by complete incompetence,&lt;ref&gt;[[George Kubler]] goes further "No human acts escape style", Kubler in Lang, 167; II, 3 in his list; Elkins, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and conversely natural objects or sights cannot be said to have a style, as style only results from choices made by a maker.&lt;ref&gt;Lang, 177–178&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether the artist makes a conscious choice of style, or can identify his own style, hardly matters.  Artists in recent developed societies tend to be highly conscious of their own style, arguably over-conscious, whereas for earlier artists stylistic choices were probably "largely unselfconscious".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 106–107, 107 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

Most stylistic periods are identified and defined later by art historians, but artists may choose to define and name their own style. The names of most older styles are the invention of art historians and would not have been understood by the practitioners of those styles. Some originated as terms of derision, including [[Gothic style|Gothic]], [[Baroque]], and [[Rococo]].&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 131; Honour &amp; Fleming, 13–14; Elkins, s. 2&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cubism]] on the other hand was a conscious identification made by a few artists; the word itself seems to have originated with critics rather than painters, but was rapidly accepted by the artists.

Western art, like that of some other cultures, most notably [[Chinese art]], has a marked tendency to revive at intervals "classic" styles from the past.&lt;ref&gt;Honour &amp; Fleming, 13&lt;/ref&gt;  In critical analysis of the visual arts, the style of a work of art is typically treated as distinct from its [[iconography]], which covers the subject and the ''content'' of the work, though for [[Jas Elsner]] this distinction is "not, of course, true in any actual example; but it has proved rhetorically extremely useful".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 107–108, 108 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
[[File:Ivory Egypt Louvre OA2753.jpg|thumb|left|14th-century [[Islamic art|Islamic]] ornament in ivory, centred on a [[palmette]]; [[Alois Riegl]]'s ''[[Stilfragen]]'' (1893) traced the evolution and transmission of such motifs.]]
Classical art criticism and the relatively few medieval writings on [[aesthetics]] did not greatly develop a concept of style in art, or analysis of it,&lt;ref&gt;classical authors did leave a considerable and subtle body of analysis of style in literature, especially [[rhetoric]]; see Gombrich, 130–131&lt;/ref&gt; and though Renaissance and Baroque writers on art are greatly concerned with what we would call style, they did not develop a coherent theory of it, at least outside architecture. [[Giorgio Vasari]] set out a hugely influential but much-questioned account of the development of style in Italian painting (mainly) from [[Giotto]] to his own [[Mannerist]] period.  He stressed the development of a [[Florence|Florentine]] style based on ''disegno'' or line-based drawing, rather than [[Venice|Venetian]] colour.  With other Renaissance theorists like [[Leon Battista Alberti]] he continued classical debates over the best balance in art between the [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] depiction of nature and idealization of it; this debate was to continue until the 19th century and the advent of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;See Blunt throughout, with in particular pp. 14–22 on Alberti, 28–34 on Leonardo, 61–64 on Michelangelo, 89–95 and 98–100 on Vasari&lt;/ref&gt;

The theorist of [[Neoclassicism]], [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], analysed the stylistic changes in Greek classical art in 1764, comparing them closely to the changes in [[Renaissance art]], and "[[Georg Hegel]] codified the notion that each historical period will have a typical style", casting a very long shadow over the study of style.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; Preziosi, 115–117; Gombrich, 136&lt;/ref&gt;  Hegel is often attributed with the invention of the [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', but he never actually used the word, although in ''[[Lectures on the Philosophy of History]]'', he uses the phrase ''der Geist seiner Zeit'' (the spirit of his time), writing "no man can surpass his own time, for the spirit of his time is also his own spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khvwPJMzNzMC&amp;pg=PA262 |page=262 |title=The Hegel Dictionary |author=Glenn Alexander Magee |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2011 |isbn=9781847065919 |chapter=Zeitgeist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructing schemes of the period styles of historic art and architecture was a major concern of 19th-century scholars in the new and initially mostly German-speaking field of [[art history]], with important writers on the broad theory of style including [[Carl Friedrich von Rumohr]], [[Gottfried Semper]], and [[Alois Riegl]] in his ''[[Stilfragen]]'' of 1893, with [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] and [[Paul Frankl]] continuing the debate in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2, 3; Rawson, 24&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Jacobsthal]] and [[Josef Strzygowski]] are among the art historians who followed Riegl in proposing grand schemes tracing the transmission of elements of styles across great ranges in time and space. This type of art history is also known as [[Formalism (art)|formalism]], or the study of forms or shapes in art.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Semper, Wölfflin, and Frankl, and later Ackerman, had backgrounds in the history of architecture, and like many other terms for period styles, "Romanesque" and "Gothic" were initially coined to describe [[architectural style]]s, where major changes between styles can be clearer and more easy to define, not least because style in architecture is easier to replicate by following a set of rules than style in figurative art such as painting.  Terms originated to describe architectural periods were often subsequently applied to other areas of the visual arts, and then more widely still to music, literature and the general culture.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 129; Elsner, 104&lt;/ref&gt;

In architecture stylistic change often follows, and is made possible by, the discovery of new techniques or materials, from the Gothic [[rib vault]] to modern metal and [[reinforced concrete]] construction.  A major area of debate in both art history and archaeology has been the extent to which stylistic change in other fields like painting or pottery is also a response to new technical possibilities, or has its own impetus to develop (the ''kunstwollen'' of Riegl), or changes in response to social and economic factors affecting patronage and the conditions of the artist, as current thinking tends to emphasize, using less rigid versions of [[Marxist]] art history.&lt;ref&gt;Gombrich, 131–136; Elkins, s. 2; Rawson, 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Although style was well-established as a central component of art historical analysis, seeing it as the over-riding factor in art history had fallen out of fashion by World War II, as other ways of looking at art were developing,&lt;ref&gt;Kubler in Lang, 163&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a reaction against the emphasis on style; for [[Svetlana Alpers]], "the normal invocation of style in art history is a depressing affair indeed".&lt;ref&gt;Alpers in Lang, 137&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Elkins (art historian)|James Elkins]] "In the later 20th century criticisms of style were aimed at further reducing the Hegelian elements of the concept while retaining it in a form that could be more easily controlled".&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2 (quoted); see also Gombrich, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; [[Meyer Schapiro]], [[James S. Ackerman|James Ackerman]], [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[George Kubler]] (''[[The Shape of Time: Remarks on the History of Things]]'', 1962) have made notable contributions to the debate, which has also drawn on wider developments in [[critical theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Elkins, s. 2; analysed by Kubler in Lang, 164–165&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 [[Jas Elsner]] put it more strongly: "For nearly the whole of the 20th century, style art history has been the indisputable king of the discipline, but since the revolutions of the seventies and eighties the king has been dead",&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 98&lt;/ref&gt; though his article explores ways in which "style art history" remains alive, and his comment would hardly be applicable to archaeology.

The use of terms such as [[Counter-Maniera|Counter-''Maniera'']] appears to be in decline, as impatience with such "style labels" grows among art historians.  In 2000 Marcia B. Hall, a leading art historian of 16th-century Italian painting and mentee of [[Sydney Joseph Freedberg]] (1914–1997), who invented the term, was criticised by a reviewer of her ''After Raphael: Painting in Central Italy in the Sixteenth Century'' for her "fundamental flaw" in continuing to use this and other terms, despite an apologetic "Note on style labels" at the beginning of the book and a promise to keep their use to a minimum.&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, 324&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Georges Seurat, 1889-90 Chahut, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Georges Seurat]]'s very individual technique and style, ''[[Le Chahut]]'', 1889–90]]

A rare recent attempt to create a theory to explain the process driving changes in artistic style, rather than just theories of how to describe and categorize them, is by the [[behavioural psychologist]] [[Colin Martindale]], who has proposed an evolutionary theory based on [[Darwinian]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;Summarized in his article "Evolution of Ancient Art: Trends in the Style of Greek Vases and Egyptian Painting", ''Visual Arts Research'', Vol. 16, No. 1(31) (Spring 1990), pp. 31–47, University of Illinois Press, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20715715 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  However this cannot be said to have gained much support among art historians.

==Individual style==

Traditional art history has also placed great emphasis on the individual style of an artist: "the notion of personal style—that individuality can be uniquely expressed not only in the way an artist draws, but also in the stylistic quirks of an author's writing (for instance)— is perhaps an axiom of Western notions of identity".&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 103&lt;/ref&gt;  The identification of individual styles is especially important in the attribution of works to artists, which is a dominant factor in their [[art valuation|valuation for the art market]], above all for works in the Western tradition since the Renaissance.  The identification of individual style in works is "essentially assigned to a group of specialists in the field known as [[Connoisseur|connoisseur]]s",&lt;ref&gt;Alpers in Lang, 139, a situation she sees as problematic&lt;/ref&gt; a group who centre in the art trade and museums, often with tensions between them and the community of academic art historians.&lt;ref&gt;Exemplified in grumbling by Grosvenor; Crane, 214–216&lt;/ref&gt;

The exercise of conoisseurship is largely a matter of subjective impressions that are hard to analyse, but also a matter of knowing details of technique and the "hand" of different artists. [[Giovanni Morelli]] (1816 – 1891) pioneered the systematic study of the scrutiny of diagnostic minor details that revealed artists' scarcely conscious shorthand and conventions for portraying, for example, ears or hands, in Western [[old master]] paintings.  His techniques were adopted by [[Bernard Berenson]] and others, and have been applied to sculpture and many other types of art, for example by Sir [[John Beazley]] to [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Attic vase painting]].&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 103; [http://arthistorians.info/morellig ''Dictionary of Art Historians'': "Giovanni Morelli"]&lt;/ref&gt;  Personal techniques can be important in analysing individual style.  Though artists' training was before Modernism essentially imitative, relying on taught technical methods, whether learnt as an apprentice in a workshop or later as a student in an academy, there was always room for personal variation.  The idea of technical "secrets" closely guarded by the master who developed them, is a long-standing ''[[Literary topos|topos]]'' in art history from Vasari's probably mythical account of Jan van Eyck to the secretive habits of [[Georges Seurat]].&lt;ref&gt;Gotlieb, throughout; 469–475 on Vasari and van Eyck; 469 on Seurat.&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:Manner of rembrandt harmensz van rijn christ among the doctors d5343274h.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Painting of ''[[Christ among the Doctors]]'', catalogued by [[Christie's]] as "Manner of Rembrandt Harmensz van Rijn" and sold for £750 in 2010]]

However the idea of personal style is certainly not limited to the Western tradition. In [[Chinese art]] it is just as deeply held, but traditionally regarded as a factor in the appreciation of some types of art, above all [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] and [[literati painting]], but not others, such as Chinese porcelain;&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 92–102; 111–119&lt;/ref&gt; a distinction also often seen in the so-called [[decorative arts]] in the West. Chinese painting also allowed for the expression of political and social views by the artist a good deal earlier than is normally detected in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  Calligraphy, also regarded as a [[fine art]] [[Islamic calligraphy|in the Islamic world]] and [[East Asia]], brings a new area within the ambit of personal style; the ideal of Western calligraphy tends to be to suppress individual style, while [[graphology]], which relies upon it, regards itself as a science.

==Manner==
"Manner" is a related term, often used for what is in effect a sub-division of a style, perhaps focused on particular points of style or technique.&lt;ref&gt;"What Is Poetry?", "Petronius Arbiter"&lt;!-- pseudonym, not the Roman writer --&gt;, ''The Art World'', Vol. 3, No. 6 (Mar., 1918), pp. 506–511, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25588388 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; While many elements of period style can be reduced to characteristic forms or shapes, that can adequately be represented in simple line-drawn diagrams, "manner" is more often used to mean the overall style and atmosphere of a work, especially complex works such as paintings, that cannot so easily be subject to precise analysis. It is a somewhat outdated term in academic art history, avoided because it is imprecise.  When used it is often in the context of imitations of the individual style of an artist, and it is one of the hierarchy of discreet or diplomatic terms used in the [[art trade]] for the relationship between a work for sale and that of a well-known artist, with "Manner of [[Rembrandt]]" suggesting a distanced relationship between the style of the work and Rembrandt's own style.  The "Explanation of Cataloguing Practice" of the auctioneers [[Christie's]]' explains that "'''Manner of ...'''" in their auction catalogues means "In our opinion a work executed in the artist's style but of a later date".&lt;ref&gt;[http://christies.scene7.com/s7/brochure/flash_brochure.jsp?company=Christies&amp;sku=AMS3025_SaleCat&amp;config=Christies/eCat_210x267_Full&amp;locale=en&amp;image=Christies/AMS3025_SaleCat Christie's "Explanation of Cataloguing Practice" (after lot listings)]. "Style" is not used for paintings etc., but for European porcelain they give the example:"A plate in the Worcester style" means "In our opinion, a copy or imitation of pieces made in the named factory, place or region". For examples, [http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/19224/lot/37/ this painting, sold by Bonhams in 2011] as "Manner of Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn", is now attributed in their notes to "an anonymous eighteenth-century follower of Rembrandt". [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/manner-of-rembrandt-harmensz-van-rijn-christ-5343274-details.aspx This example sold by Christie's] fetched only £750 in 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mannerism]], derived from the Italian ''maniera'' ("manner") is a specific phase of the general Renaissance style, but "manner" can be used very widely.

==Style in archaeology==
[[File:1911 Britannica-Archaeology-Palaeolithic.png|thumb|right|[[Paleolithic]] stone tools grouped by period]]

In [[archaeology]], despite modern techniques like [[radiocarbon dating]], period or cultural style remains a crucial tool in the identification and [[Dating methodologies in archaeology|dating]] not only of works of art but all classes of [[archaeological artefact]], including purely functional ones (ignoring the question of whether purely functional artefacts exist).&lt;ref&gt;See also Alpers in Lang, 140&lt;/ref&gt; The identification of individual styles of artists or [[artisan]]s has also been proposed in some cases even for remote periods such as the [[Ice Age art]] of the European [[Upper Paleolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;Bahn &amp; Vertut, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

As in art history, [[formal analysis]] of the [[morphology (archaeology)|morphology]] (shape) of individual artefacts is the starting point. This is used to construct [[Typology (archaeology)|typologies]] for different types of artefacts, and by the technique of [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] a [[relative dating]] based on style for a site or group of sites is achieved where scientific [[absolute dating]] techniques cannot be used, in particular where only stone, ceramic or metal artefacts or remains are available, which is often the case.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thermoluminescence dating]] can be used for much ceramic material, and the developing method of [[Rehydroxylation dating]] may become widely used.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sherd]]s of [[pottery]] are often very numerous in sites from many cultures and periods, and even small pieces may be confidently dated by their style. In contrast to recent trends in academic art history, the succession of schools of archaeological theory in the last century, from [[culture-historical archaeology]] to [[processual archaeology]] and finally the rise of [[post-processual archaeology]] in recent decades has not significantly reduced the importance of the study of style in archaeology, as a basis for classifying objects before further interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Review by Mary Ann Levine of ''The Uses of Style in Archaeology'', edited by [[Margaret Conkey]] and Christine Hastorf (see further reading), pp. 779–780, ''American Antiquity'', Vol. 58, No. 4 (Oct., 1993), Society for American Archaeology, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/282229 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stylization==
[[File:Uffington-White-Horse-sat.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of the very stylized prehistoric [[Uffington White Horse]] in England]]
'''Stylization''' and '''stylized''' (or "stylisation" and "stylised" in (non-Oxford) [[British English]], respectively) have a more specific meaning, referring to visual depictions that use simplified ways of representing objects or scenes that do not attempt a full, precise and accurate representation of their visual appearance (''[[mimesis]]'' or "[[Realism (arts)|realistic]]"), preferring an attractive or expressive overall depiction.  More technically, it has been defined as "the decorative generalization of figures and objects by means of various conventional techniques, including the simplification of line, form, and relationships of space and color",&lt;ref&gt;"Stylization" in the ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'', 1979, online at [http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Stylization The Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; and observed that "[s]tylized art reduces visual perception to constructs of pattern in line, surface elaboration and flattened space".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Willene B., ''A Medieval Book of Beasts: The Second-Family Bestiary, Commentary, Art, Text And Translation'', p. 54, 2006, Boydell Press, {{ISBN|0851156827}}, 9780851156828, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0olPRmCoE8MC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=Stylization+in+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NFqIaLTG4F&amp;sig=p-PbpnBNfgUusEYLRigTrlC3Ebc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fJo4UeflKYetPP3YgIgK&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Stylization%20in%20art&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ancient, traditional, and [[modern art]], as well as popular forms such as [[cartoon]]s or [[animation]] very often use stylized representations, so for example ''[[The Simpsons]]'' use highly stylized depictions, as does traditional [[African art]].  The two Picasso paintings illustrated at the top of this page show a movement to a more stylized representation of the human figure within the painter's style,&lt;ref&gt;See Elsner, 107 on Picasso as the paradigm of "the supremely self-conscious poseur in any style you like".&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Uffington White Horse]] is an example of a highly stylized prehistoric depiction of a horse.  Motifs in the [[decorative arts]] such as the [[palmette]] or [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] are often highly stylized versions of the parts of plants.

Even in art that is in general attempting mimesis or "realism", a degree of stylization is very often found in details, and especially figures or other features at a small scale, such as people or trees etc. in the distant background even of a large work.  But this is not stylization intended to be noticed by the viewer, except on close examination.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway, John, ''The Slumber of Apollo: Reflections on Recent Art, Literature, Language and the Individual Consciousness'', p. 30, 1983, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521248043}}, 9780521248044, [https://books.google.com/books?id=EuoILxxW9cQC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=Stylization+in+art&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qJw4UbeGIsS7PaHJgNAC&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Stylization%20in%20art&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings, ''[[modelli]]'', and other sketches not intended as finished works for sale will also very often stylize.

"Stylized" may mean the adoption of any style in any context, and in [[American English]] is often used for the [[typographic]] style of names, as in "[[AT&amp;T]] is also stylized as ATT and at&amp;t": this is a specific usage that seems to have escaped dictionaries, although it is a small extension of existing other senses of the word.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

'''Taiwanese units of measurement''' ({{zh|t=臺制|p=Táizhì|poj=Tâi-chè}}) are the customary and traditional [[Units of measurement|units of measure]] used in [[Taiwan]].  Many of the units derive from [[Japanese units of measurement]] and have similar names as [[Chinese units of measurement]] but different conversions than in [[mainland China]] or [[Hong Kong]].  In some cases these units are used exclusively, in some cases alongside official [[International System of Units|metric (SI)]] units, and in other cases they have been supplanted by metric units.  [[Linguistics|Linguistically]], practically all Taiwanese units of measure are [[Chinese classifier]]s used to [[classifier (linguistics)|classify]] [[nouns]].

==Length==
Linear measure in Taiwan is largely metric but some units derived from traditional Japanese units of measurement remain in use as a legacy of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]].

{|  class="wikitable"
! Unit || Definition || Basis
|-
| 1 Taiwanese inch ({{zh|c={{linktext|寸}}|p=cùn|poj=chhùn|labels=no}}) || 3.030{{nbsp}}cm || Japanese ''[[Cun (unit)|sun]]''
|-
| 1 Taiwanese foot ({{zh|c={{linktext|尺}}|p=chǐ|poj=chhioh|labels=no}}) || 30.30{{nbsp}}cm || Japanese ''[[Shaku (unit)|shaku]]''
|}

==Area==
[[File:10-Phêng Apartment.JPG|thumb|200px|An advertisement from [[IKEA]] for a 10-''ping'' apartment]]

Unlike with other measures, area continues to be almost commonly measured with traditional units. The principal unit for measuring the floorspace of an office or apartment, the ''ping'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|坪}}|p=píng|poj=pêⁿ / pîⁿ / phêⁿ / phîⁿ / phiâⁿ / phêng|labels=no}}) derives from the Japanese ''[[Japanese units of measurement#Area|tsubo]]'', the base unit of the Japanese area. Taiwanese units of [[land measurement]] derive from both traditional [[Dutch units of measurement|Dutch]] and Japanese measurements.  The principal unit of land measure, the ''jia'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|甲}}|p=jiǎ|poj=kah|labels=no}}), derives from the obsolete Dutch ''[[morgen]]'', which was introduced during Taiwan's [[Dutch Formosa|Dutch era]]. The ''li'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|犁}}|p=lí|poj=lê|labels=no}}) represented the area that could be farmed by one man with one ox and one plow in one day.

*1&amp;nbsp;''ping'' = 36&amp;nbsp;square ''chi'' = {{convert|3.306|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}
*1&amp;nbsp;''mu'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|畝}}|p=mǔ|poj=bó͘|labels=no}}) = 30&amp;nbsp;''ping'' = {{convert|99.2|m2|ft2|abbr=on}}
*1&amp;nbsp;''jia'' = 2,934&amp;nbsp;''ping'' = {{convert|0.9699|hectare|acre}}{{sfnp|MOE|2011|loc=#1857}}
*1&amp;nbsp;''li'' = 5&amp;nbsp;''jia''  = {{convert|4.8496|hectare|acre}}

Officially, land area is measured in [[hectare]]s and [[square kilometer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=zh:《中華民國統計資訊網》縣市重要統計指標查詢系統網|url=http://statdb.dgbas.gov.tw/pxweb/Dialog/statfile9.asp|accessdate=25 July 2016|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volume==
Volume measure in Taiwan is largely metric, with common units such as liter and milliliter.

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

==Mass==
[[Image:Sam-ho-chhi.jpg|thumb|Fruit sold in [[catty|catties]] in a Taiwanese market]]
Packaged goods in Taiwan largely use metric measurements but bulk foodstuffs sold in [[wet market]]s and [[supermarket]]s are typically measured with units derived from traditional [[Japanese_units_of_measurement#Mass|Japanese units of mass]], which are similar but not equivalent to corresponding [[Chinese_units_of_measurement#Mass|Chinese units of mass]]. 

*1&amp;nbsp;[[Cash (unit)|cash]] ({{zh|c=釐|p=lí|poj=lî|labels=no}}) = 37.5&amp;nbsp;[[milligram|mg]]
*1&amp;nbsp;[[candareen]] ({{zh|c=分|p=fēn|poj=hun|labels=no}}) = 10&amp;nbsp;cash = 375&amp;nbsp;mg
*1&amp;nbsp;[[Mace (measurement)|mace]] ({{zh|c=錢|p=qián|poj=chîⁿ|labels=no}}) = 10&amp;nbsp;candareens = 3.75&amp;nbsp;[[gram|g]]
*1&amp;nbsp;[[tael#Taiwan|tael]] ({{zh|c=兩|p=liǎng|poj=niú|labels=no}}) = 10&amp;nbsp;mace = 37.5&amp;nbsp;g
*1&amp;nbsp;[[catty]] ({{zh|c=斤|p=jīn|poj=kin/kun|labels=no}}) = 16&amp;nbsp;taels = 0.6&amp;nbsp;[[kilogram|kg]]
*1&amp;nbsp;[[picul]] ({{zh|c=擔|p=dān|poj=tàⁿ|labels=no}}) = 100&amp;nbsp;catties = 60&amp;nbsp;kg

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5375">'''Technological evolution''' is a theory of radical transformation of society through technological development. This theory originated with [[Czechs|Czech]] philosopher [[Radovan Richta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Böhme|first1=Gernot|last2=Stehr|first2=Nico|title=The Knowledge Society: The Growing Impact of Scientific Knowledge on Social Relations|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400947245|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3mdDBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=radovan%20richta%20describes%20the%20radical%20transformation%20of%20society%20through%20technological%20development&amp;pg=PA5|accessdate=27 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory of technological evolution==
''[[Mankind in Transition|Mankind In Transition]]; A View of the Distant Past, the Present and the Far Future'', Masefield Books, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloomfield|first1=Masse|title=The Automated Society; A View of the Distant Past, the Present and the Far Future|date=1993|publisher=Masefield Books|isbn=1879981025|url=http://massebloomfield.com/books/the-automated-society/|accessdate=29 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Technology]] (which Richta defines as "a material entity created by the application of mental and physical effort to nature in order to achieve some value") evolves in three stages: tools, machine, automation. This evolution, he says, follows two trends:

===Development===
The pretechnological period, in which all other animal species remain today aside from some avian and primate species was a non-rational period of the early [[Prehistory|prehistoric man]].

The emergence of technology, made possible by the development of the rational faculty, paved the way for the first stage: the tool. A tool provides a mechanical advantage in accomplishing a physical task, such as an arrow, plow, or hammer that augments physical labor to more efficiently achieve his objective. Later animal-powered tools such as the plow and the horse, increased the productivity of food production about tenfold over the technology of the hunter-gatherers. Tools allow one to do things impossible to accomplish with one's body alone, such as seeing minute visual detail with a [[microscope]], manipulating heavy objects with a [[pulley]] and cart, or carrying volumes of water in a bucket.

The second technological stage was the creation of the [[machine]]. A machine (a powered machine to be more precise) is a tool that substitutes the element of human physical effort, and requires  only to control its function. Machines became widespread with the industrial revolution, though [[windmills]], a type of machine, are much older.

Examples of this include cars, trains, [[computers]], and lights. Machines allow humans to
Tremendously exceed the limitations of their bodies. Putting a machine on the farm, a tractor, increased food productivity at least tenfold over the technology of the plow and the horse.

The third, and final stage of technological evolution is the [[automation]]. The automation is a machine that removes the element of human control with an automatic algorithm. Examples of machines that exhibit this characteristic are [[digital watches]], automatic telephone switches, [[pacemakers]], and computer programs.

It's crucial to understand that the three stages outline the introduction of the fundamental types of technology, and so all three continue to be widely used today. A spear, a plow, a pen, a knife, a glove, a chicken and an optical microscope are all examples of tools.

===Theoretical implications===
The process of technological evolution culminates with the ability to achieve all the material values technologically possible and desirable by mental effort.

An [[Economics|economic]] implication of the above idea is that intellectual labour will become increasingly more important relative to physical labour. Contracts and agreements around information will become increasingly more common at the marketplace. Expansion and creation of new kinds of institutes that works with information such as    universities, book stores, patent-trading companies, etc. is considered an indication that a civilization is in technological evolution.

This highlights the importance underlining the debate over intellectual property in conjunction with decentralized distribution systems such as today's internet. Where the price of information distribution is going towards zero with ever more efficient tools to distribute information is being invented. Growing amounts of information being distributed to an increasingly larger customer base as times goes by. With growing [[disintermediation]] in said markets and growing concerns over the protection of intellectual property rights it is not clear what form markets for information will take with the evolution of the information age.

'''Telexistence'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Susumu Tachi]], Telexistence, World Scientific Publishing Company, {{ISBN|978-981-283-633-5}}, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is fundamentally a concept named for the general [[technology]] that enables a [[human]] being to have a real-time sensation of being at a place other than where he or she actually exists, and being able to interact with the remote environment, which may be real, virtual, or a combination of both. It also refers to an advanced type of teleoperation system that enables an operator at the control to perform remote tasks dexterously with the feeling of existing in a surrogate [[robot]] working in a remote environment. Telexistence in the real environment through a virtual environment is also possible. This concept was first proposed by [[Susumu Tachi]] in Japan in 1980 &lt;ref&gt;S.Tachi, K.Tanie and K.Komoriya: Evaluation device of mobility aids for the blind,
 Japanese Patent 1462696 filed on December 26, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1981 &lt;ref&gt;S.Tachi, K.Tanie and K.Komoriya: Operation method of manipulators with sensoryinformation display functions, Japanese Patent 1458263 filed on January 14, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; as patents and the first report was published in Japanese in 1982 &lt;ref&gt;S.Tachi and M.Abe: Study on Telexistence (I) -Desigan of Visual Display-, Proceedings of the 21st SICE Annual Conference, pp.167-168, Tokyo, July 28–30, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; and in English in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tachi, K. Tanie, K. Komoriya and M. Kaneko, Tele-existence (I): Design and Evaluation of a Visual Display with Sensation of Presence, ''RoManSy 84 The Fifth CISM-IFToMM Symposium.'' 1984: 206–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an abstract set, a ternary equivalence relation determines a collection of equivalence classes or ''[[pencil (mathematics)|pencils]]'' that form a [[linear space (geometry)|linear space]] in the sense of [[incidence geometry]]. In the same way,  a binary equivalence relation on a set determines a [[partition of a set|partition]].

==Definition==
A ternary equivalence relation on a set {{mvar|X}} is a relation {{math|''E'' ⊂ ''X''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, written {{math|[''a'', ''b'', ''c'']}}, that satisfies the following axioms:
#Symmetry: If {{math|[''a'', ''b'', ''c'']}} then {{math|[''b'', ''c'', ''a'']}} and {{math|[''c'', ''b'', ''a'']}}. (Therefore also {{math|[''a'', ''c'', ''b'']}}, {{math|[''b'', ''a'', ''c'']}}, and {{math|[''c'', ''a'', ''b'']}}.)
#Reflexivity: {{math|[''a'', ''b'', ''b'']}}. Equivalently, if {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}}, and {{mvar|c}} are not all distinct, then {{math|[''a'', ''b'', ''c'']}}.
#Transitivity:  If {{math|''a'' ≠ ''b''}} and {{math|[''a'', ''b'', ''c'']}} and {{math|[''a'', ''b'', ''d'']}} then {{math|[''b'', ''c'', ''d'']}}. (Therefore also {{math|[''a'', ''c'', ''d'']}}.)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14210">A '''thermodynamic operation''' is an externally imposed manipulation or change of connection or wall between a [[thermodynamic system]] and its surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;[[László Tisza|Tisza, L.]] (1966), pp. 41, 109, 121, originally published as 'The thermodynamics of phase equilibrium', ''Annals of Physics'', '''13''': 1–92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giles 22"&gt;Giles, R. (1964), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="L&amp;Y 14"&gt;Lieb, E.H., Yngvason, J. (1999).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]](1960/1985), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; An externally imposed change in the state of the surroundings of a system can usually be regarded as a virtual thermodynamic operation. It may usually be analyzed as due to changes in the walls that separate the systems in the surroundings. It is assumed in thermodynamics that the operation is conducted in ignorance of any pertinent microscopic information.

A thermodynamic operation requires a contribution from an independent external agency, that does not come from the passive properties of the systems. Perhaps the first expression of the distinction between a thermodynamic operation and a thermodynamic process is in Kelvin's statement of the [[second law of thermodynamics]]: "It is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the temperature of the surrounding objects." A sequence of events that occurred other than "by means of inanimate material agency" would entail an action by an animate agency, or at least an independent external agency. Such an agency could impose some thermodynamic operations. For example, those operations might create a heat pump, which of course would comply with the second law. A [[Maxwell's demon]] conducts an extremely idealized and naturally unrealizable kind of thermodynamic operation.&lt;ref&gt;Bailyn, M. (1994), pp. 88, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ordinary language expression for a thermodynamic operation is used by [[Edward A. Guggenheim]]: "tampering" with the bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward A. Guggenheim|Guggenheim, E.A.]] (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction between thermodynamic operation and thermodynamic process==

A typical thermodynamic operation is a removal of an initially separating wall, a manipulation that unites two systems into one undivided system. A typical thermodynamic process consists of a redistribution that spreads a conserved quantity between a system and its surroundings across a previously impermeable but newly unchanging semi-permeable wall between them.&lt;ref&gt;[[László Tisza|Tisza, L.]] (1966), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, a process can be considered as a transfer of some quantity that is defined by an extensive state variable of the system, so that a transfer balance equation can be written.&lt;ref&gt;Gyarmati, I. (1970), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Uffink, "... thermodynamic processes only take place after an external intervention on the system (such as: removing a partition, establishing thermal contact with a heat bath, pushing a piston, etc.). They do not correspond to the autonomous behaviour of a free system."&lt;ref&gt;Uffink, J. (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a matter of history, the distinction, between a thermodynamic operation and a thermodynamic process, is not found in these terms in nineteenth century accounts. For example, Kelvin spoke of a "thermodynamic operation" when he meant what present-day terminology calls a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Kelvin, Lord]] (1857).&lt;/ref&gt; Again, Planck usually spoke of a "process" when our present-day terminology would speak of a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1887).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1897/1903), p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planck's "natural processes" contrasted with actions of Maxwell's demon===

Planck held that all "natural processes" (meaning, in present-day terminology, a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process) are irreversible and proceed in the sense of increase of entropy sum.&lt;ref&gt;Guggenheim, A.E. (1949/1967), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In these terms, it would be by thermodynamic operations that, if he could exist, Maxwell's demon would conduct unnatural affairs, which include transitions in the sense away from thermodynamic equilibrium. They are physically theoretically conceivable up to a point, but are not natural processes in Planck's sense. The reason is that ordinary thermodynamic operations are conducted in total ignorance of the very kinds of microscopic information that is essential to the efforts of Maxwell's demon.

==Examples of thermodynamic operations==
===Thermodynamic cycle===

A [[thermodynamic cycle]] is constructed as a sequence of stages or steps. Each stage consists of a thermodynamic operation followed by a thermodynamic process. For example, an initial thermodynamic operation of a cycle of a [[Carnot heat engine]] could be taken as the setting of the working body, at a known high temperature, into contact with a thermal reservoir at the same temperature (the hot reservoir), through a wall permeable only to heat, while it remains in mechanical contact with the work reservoir. This thermodynamic operation is followed by a thermodynamic process, in which the expansion of the working body is so slow as to be effectively reversible, while internal energy is transferred as heat from the hot reservoir to the working body and as work from the working body to the work reservoir. Theoretically, the process terminates eventually, and this ends the stage. The engine is then subject to another thermodynamic operation, and the cycle proceeds into another stage. The cycle completes when the thermodynamic variables (the thermodynamic state) of the working body return to their initial values.

===Virtual thermodynamic operations===

A [[refrigerator|refrigeration device]] passes a working substance through successive stages, overall constituting a cycle. This may be brought about not by moving or changing separating walls around an unmoving body of working substance, but rather by moving a body of working substance to bring about exposure to a cyclic succession of unmoving unchanging walls. The effect is virtually a cycle of thermodynamic operations. The kinetic energy of bulk  motion of the working substance is not a significant feature of the device, and the working substance may be practically considered as nearly at rest.

===Composition of systems===

For many chains of reasoning in thermodynamics, it is convenient to think of the combination of two systems into one. It is imagined that the two systems, separated from their surroundings, are juxtaposed and (by a shift of viewpoint) regarded as constituting a new, composite system. The composite system is imagined amid its new overall surroundings. This sets up the possibility of interaction between the two subsystems and between the composite system and its overall surroundings, for example by allowing contact through a wall with a particular kind of permeability. This conceptual device was introduced into thermodynamics mainly in the work of Carathéodory, and has been widely used since then.&lt;ref name="Giles 22"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L&amp;Y 14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[László Tisza|Tisza, L.]] (1966), pp. 41, 50, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carathéodory 1909"&gt;[[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory, C.]] (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1960/1985), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additivity of extensive variables===

If the thermodynamic operation is entire removal of walls, then extensive state variables of the composed system are the respective sums of those of the component systems. This is called the '''additivity''' of extensive variables.

===Scaling of a system===

A thermodynamic system consisting of a single phase, in the absence of external forces, in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, is homogeneous.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Planck|Planck, M.]] (1897/1903), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the material in any region of the system can be interchanged with the material of any congruent and parallel region of the system, and the effect is to leave the system thermodynamically unchanged. The thermodynamic operation of ''scaling'' is the creation of a new homogeneous system whose size is a multiple of the old size, and whose [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive variables]] have the same values. Traditionally the size is stated by the mass of the system, but sometimes it is stated by the entropy, or by the volume.&lt;ref&gt;Landsberg, P.T. (1961), pp. 129–130.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[László Tisza|Tisza, L.]], (1966), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haase, R. (1971), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert Callen|Callen, H.B.]] (1960/1985), pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; For a given such system {{math|Φ}}, scaled by the real number {{math|''λ''}} to yield a new one {{math|''λ''Φ}}, a [[state function]], {{math|''X''(.)}}, such that {{math|''X''(''λ''Φ) {{=}} ''λ X''(Φ)}}, is said to be [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]]. Such a function as {{math|''X''}} is called a [[homogeneous function]] of degree 1. There are two different concepts mentioned here, sharing the same name:  (a) the mathematical concept of degree-1 homogeneity in the scaling function; and (b)  the physical concept of the spatial homogeneity of the system. It happens that the two agree here, but that is not because they are tautologous. It is a contingent fact of thermodynamics.

===Splitting and recomposition of systems===

If two systems, {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;b''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;nbsp;, have identical intensive variables, a thermodynamic operation of wall removal can compose them into a single system, {{math|''S''}}, with the same intensive variables. If, for example, their internal energies are in the ratio {{math|''λ'':(1−''λ'')}}, then the composed system, {{math|''S''}}, has internal energy in the ratio of {{math|1:''λ''}} to that of the system {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. By the inverse thermodynamic operation, the system {{math|''S''}} can be split into two subsystems in the obvious way. As usual, these thermodynamic operations are conducted in total ignorance of the microscopic states of the systems. More particularly, it is characteristic of macroscopic thermodynamics that the probability vanishes, that the splitting operation occurs at an instant when system {{math|''S''}} is in the kind of extreme transient microscopic state envisaged by the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem|Poincaré recurrence]] argument. Such splitting and recomposition is in accord with the above defined additivity of extensive variables.

==Statements of laws==

Thermodynamic operations appear in the statements of the laws of thermodynamics. For the zeroth law, one considers operations of thermally connecting and disconnecting systems. For the second law, some statements contemplate an operation of connecting two initially unconnected systems. For the third law, one statement is that no finite sequence of thermodynamic operations can bring a system to absolute zero temperature.

In [[musical tuning]] and [[harmony]], the '''Tonnetz''' ({{lang-de|tone-network}}) is a conceptual [[Lattice (music)|lattice]] [[diagram]] representing tonal space first described by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1739.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; Various visual representations of the ''Tonnetz'' can be used to show [[Tonality|traditional harmonic relationships]] in European classical music.

==History through 1900==
[[Image:Eulers tonnetz.png|thumb|left|Euler's Tonnetz.]]

The ''Tonnetz'' originally appeared in Euler's 1739 ''Tentamen novae theoriae musicae ex certissismis harmoniae principiis dilucide expositae''. Euler's Tonnetz, pictured at left, shows the triadic relationships of the perfect fifth and the major third: at the top of the image is the note F, and to the left underneath is C (a perfect fifth above F), and to the right is A (a major third above F). The space was rediscovered in 1858 by Ernst Naumann, and was disseminated in an 1866 treatise of [[Arthur von Oettingen]]. Oettingen and the influential musicologist [[Hugo Riemann]] (not to be confused with the mathematician [[Bernhard Riemann]]) explored the capacity of the space to chart harmonic motion between chords and modulation between keys. Similar understandings of the ''Tonnetz'' appeared in the work of many late-19th century German music theorists.&lt;ref name="cohnintro"&gt;{{cite journal
|last1=Cohn|first1=Richard
|title=Introduction to Neo-Riemannian Theory: A Survey and a Historical Perspective
|journal=Journal of Music Theory|year=1998|volume=42|issue=2 Autumn|pages=167–180|ref=harv|jstor=843871}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oettingen and Riemann both conceived of the relationships in the chart being defined through [[just intonation]], which uses pure intervals. One can extend out one of the horizontal rows of the Tonnetz indefinitely, to form a never-ending sequence of perfect fifths: F-C-G-D-A-E-B-F#-C#-G#-D#-A#-E#-B#-Fx-Cx-Gx- (etc.) Starting with F, after 12 perfect fifths, one reaches E#. Perfect fifths in just intonation are slightly larger than the compromised fifths used in [[equal temperament]] tuning systems more common in the present. This means that when one stacks 12 fifths starting from F, the E# we arrive at will not be exactly seven octaves above the F we started with. Oettingen and Riemann's ''Tonnetz'' thus extended on infinitely in every direction without actually repeating any pitches.

The appeal of the ''Tonnetz'' to 19th-century German theorists was that it allows spatial representations of tonal distance and tonal relationships. For example, looking at the dark blue A minor triad in the graphic at the beginning of the article, its parallel major triad (A-C#-E) is the triangle right below, sharing the vertices A and E. The relative major of A minor, C major (C-E-G) is the upper-right adjacent triangle, sharing the C and the E vertices. The dominant triad of A minor, E major (E-G#-B) is diagonally across the E vertex, and shares no other vertices. One important point is that every shared vertex between a pair of triangles is a shared pitch between chords - the more shared vertices, the more shared pitches the chord will have. This provides a visualization of the principle of parsimonious voice-leading, in which motions between chords are considered smoother when fewer pitches change. This principle is especially important in analyzing the music of late-19th century composers like Wagner, who frequently avoided traditional tonal relationships. &lt;ref name="cohnintro"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twentieth-century reinterpretation==
{{main|Neo-Riemannian theory}}
[[Image:PLR on tonnetz.png|thumb|right|Neo-Riemannian music theory's PLR operations applied to a minor chord&amp;nbsp;Q.]]

Recent research by [[Neo-Riemannian theory|Neo-Riemannian]] music theorists [[David Lewin]], Brian Hyer, and others, have revived the ''Tonnetz'' to further explore properties of pitch structures. &lt;ref name="cohnintro"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Modern music theorists generally construct the ''Tonnetz'' using [[equal temperament]],&lt;ref name="cohnintro"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and using pitch-classes, which make no distinction between octave transpositions of a pitch. Under equal temperament, the never-ending series of ascending fifths mentioned earlier becomes a cycle. Neo-Riemannian theorists typically assume enharmonic equivalence (in other words, Ab&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;G#), and so the two-dimensional plane of the 19th-century ''Tonnetz'' cycles in on itself in two different directions, and is mathematically [[isomorphic]] to a [[torus]]. Theorists have studied the structure of this new cyclical version using mathematical [[group theory]]{{citation needed|reason=Which theorists?|date=March 2016}}.

Neo-Riemannian theorists have also used the ''Tonnetz'' to visualize non-tonal triadic relationships. For example, the diagonal going up and to the left from C in the diagram at the beginning of the article forms a division of the octave in three [[major third]]s: C-Ab-E-C (the E is actually an Fb, and the final C a Dbb). Richard Cohn argues that while a sequence of triads built on these three pitches (C major, Ab major, and E major) cannot be adequately described using traditional concepts of functional harmony, this cycle has smooth voice leading and other important group properties which can be easily observed on the ''Tonnetz''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cohn|first=Richard|title=Maximally Smooth Cycles, Hexatonic Systems, and the Analysis of Late-Romantic Triadic Progressions|journal=Music Analysis|date=March 1996|volume=15|issue=1|pages=9–40|doi=10.2307/854168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similarities to other graphical systems==
The [[harmonic table note layout]] is a recently{{when|date=May 2012}} developed musical interface that uses a note layout topologically equivalent to the Tonnetz.

A ''Tonnetz'' of the [[syntonic temperament]] can be derived from a given [[isomorphic keyboard]] by connecting lines of successive [[perfect fifth]]s, lines of successive [[major third]]s, and lines of successive [[minor third]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[topology]] of the [[syntonic temperament]]'s Tonnetz is generally [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]].

[[Image:Chord Lattice.jpg|thumb|right|Tonnetz showing enclosed chords. Capitalized chords ('Xx') are major; others ('xx') are minor.]]

The ''Tonnetz'' is the [[dual graph]] of [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]'s '''chart of the regions''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In [[theoretical computer science]], in particular in the theory of [[formal language]]s, '''useless rules''' of a [[formal grammar]] are those [[Rules of language|rules]] of symbol production that are unreachable or unproductive, that is, that can or need never be applied.

==Definition==
Given a [[context-free grammar]], a [[nonterminal]] symbol ''X'' is called '''productive''', or '''generating''', if there is a [[formal grammar#The semantics of grammars|derivation]] ''X'' [[formal grammar#The semantics of grammars|⇒&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;]] ''w'' for some string ''w'' of terminal symbols. A nonterminal symbol ''X'' is called '''reachable''' if there is a derivation ''S'' ⇒&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; α''X''β for some strings α, β of non-terminal and terminal symbols, and where ''S'' denotes the grammar's [[start symbol (formal languages)|start symbol]].

A rule with an unproductive or unreachable symbol on its left-hand side can be deleted from the grammar without changing the accepted (a.k.a. generated) language.
Likewise, an alternative containing such a symbol can be deleted from the right-hand side of a rule without changing the language.
Such rules and alternatives are called '''useless'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John E. Hopcroft |author2=Rajeev Motwani |author3=Jeffrey D. Ullman | title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation| year=2003| publisher=Addison Wesley}}; here: Sect.7.1.1, p.256&lt;/ref&gt;

For formal grammars that are [[Chomsky hierarchy|not context-free]], similar definitions apply.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Examples==

Denoting nonterminal and terminal symbols by upper- and lower-case letters, respectively,
in the following [[regular grammar]] with start symbol ''S''
{|
|-
| | ''S'' → ''Bb'' | ''Cc'' | ''Ee''
|-
| | ''B'' → ''Bb'' | ''b''
|-
| | ''C'' → ''Cc'' | ''c''
|-
| | ''D'' → ''Bd'' | ''Cd'' | ''d''
|-
| | ''E'' → ''Ee''
|}

the nonterminal ''D'' is unreachable, and ''E'' is unproductive.
Hence, omitting the last two rules doesn't change the language accepted by the grammar, nor does omitting the alternative "| ''Ee''" from the right-hand side of the rule for ''S''.

==Cleaning Useless Rules==
Hopcroft, et al.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 7.2, Sect.7.1, p.255ff&lt;/ref&gt; give an algorithm to eliminate useless rules from a [[context-free grammar]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14231">'''Values scales''' are psychological inventories used to determine the values that people endorse in their [[personal life | lives]].  They facilitate the understanding of both work and general [[values]] that individuals uphold.  In addition, they assess the importance of each value in people's lives and how the individual strives toward fulfillment through work and other life roles, such as parenting.&lt;ref name="SuperDonald"&gt;Super, Donald and Dorothy D. Nevill.  "Brief Description of Purpose and Nature of Test." ''Consulting Psychologists Press'.' 1989:  3-10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Most scales have been normalized and can therefore be used cross-culturally for [[vocational]], [[marketing]], and [[counseling]] purposes, yielding unbiased results.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"&gt;Beatty, Sharon E., et al. "Alternative Measurement Approaches to Consumer Values: The List of Values and the Rokeach Value Survey." Psychology and Marketing. 1985: 181-200. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychologists]], [[political scientists]], [[economists]], and others interested in defining values, use values scales to determine what people value, and to evaluate the ultimate function or purpose of values.&lt;ref&gt;
Johnston, Charles S. "The Rokeach Value Survey: Underlying Structure and Multidimensional Scaling."  ''The Journal of Psychology''. 1995: 583-597. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

Values scales were first developed by an international group of [[psychologists]] whose goal was to create a unique [[self-report]] instrument that measured [[intrinsic]] and [[extrinsic]] values for use in the lab and in the clinic.  The psychologists called their project the [[Work Importance Study]] (WIS).  The original values scale measured the following values, listed in alphabetical order:  ability utilization, achievement, advancement, [[aesthetics]], [[altruism]], [[authority]], [[autonomy]], [[creativity]], [[cultural identity]], economic rewards, economic security, life style, personal development, [[physical activity]], physical prowess, prestige, [[risk]], [[social interaction]], [[social relations]], variety, and [[working conditions]].  Some of the listed values were intended to be inter-related, but conceptually differentiable.&lt;ref name="SuperDonald" /&gt;

Since the original Work Importance Study, several scientists have supplemented the study by creating their own scale or by deriving and improving the original format.  Theorists and psychologists often study values, values scales, and the field surrounding values, otherwise known as [[axiology]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"&gt;Kopelman, Richard E., et al. “The Study of Values: Construction of the fourth edition.” ''Journal of Vocational Behavior.'' 2003: 203-220. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  New studies have even been published recently, updating the work in the field.  Dr. Eda Gurel-Atay published an article in the ''Journal of Advertising Research'' in March 2010, providing a glimpse into how social values have changed between 1976 and 2007.  The paper explained how “self-respect” has been on the upswing, while “a sense of belonging” has become less important to individuals.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1976"&gt;Gurel-Atay, Eda. “Changes in Social Values in the United States: 1976-2007, Self-Respect is on the Upswing as “A Sense of Belonging” Becomes Less Important.”  ''Journal of Advertising Research.'' 2010: 57-67. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rokeach ===

According to social psychologist [[Milton Rokeach]], [[human values]] are defined as “core conceptions of the desirable within every individual and society.  They serve as standards or criteria to guide not only action but also judgment, choice, attitude, evaluation, argument, exhortation, rationalization, and…attribution of causality.”&lt;ref&gt;Rokeach, M. “The Nature of Human Values.” ''The Free Press.'' NY: Free Press. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1973 publication, Rokeach also stated that the consequences of human values would be manifested in all phenomena that social scientists might consider worth investigating.  In order for any type of research to be successful, regardless of the field of study, people’s underlying values needed to be understood.  To allow for this, Rokeach created the [[Rokeach Value Survey]] (RVS), which has been in use for more than 30 years.  It provides a theoretical perspective on the nature of values in a cognitive framework and consists of two sets of values – 18 instrumental and 18 terminal.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;Clawson, C. J., &amp; Vinson, D. E. (1978). Human Values: a Historical and Interdisciplinary Analysis. ''North America - Advances in Consumer Research'', ''5'', 396–402. Retrieved from http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=9454&lt;/ref&gt; Instrumental values are beliefs or conceptions about desirable modes of behavior that are instrumental to the attainment of desirable end points, such as honesty, responsibility, and capability.  Terminal values are beliefs or conceptions about ultimate goals of existence that are worth surviving for, such as happiness, self-respect, and freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Piirto, Jane. “I Live in My Own Bubble: The Values of Talented Adolescents.” ''The Journal of Secondary Gifted Education.'' 2005: 106-118. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The value survey asks subjects to rank the values in order of importance to them.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; The actual directions are as follows: “Rank each value in its order of importance to you.  Study the list and think of how much each value may act as a guiding principle in your life.”&lt;ref&gt;Rokeach, M. “The Nature of Human Values.” ''The Free Press''. NY: Free Press. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Rokeach Value Survey has been criticized because people are often not able to rank each value clearly.  Some values may be equally important, while some values may be equally unimportant, and so on.  Presumably, people are more certain of their most extreme values (i.e. what they love and what they hate) and are not so certain of the ones  “in between.”  Further, [[C.J. Clawson]] and [[Donald E. Vinson]] showed that the Rokeach Value Survey omitted a number of values that a large portion of the population holds.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt;

=== Schwartz ===
[[Image:Shalom H Schwartz.jpg|thumb|alt=Shalom_H_Schwartz|Frame|Shalom H. Schwartz]]
[[Shalom H. Schwartz]], social psychologist and author of ''[[The Structure of Human Values: Origins and Implications]]'' and ''[[Theory of Basic Human Values]]'', has done research on [[universal values]] and how they exist in a wide variety of contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, S.H. "Are There Universal Aspects in the Content and Structure of Values?" ''Journal of Social Issues.'' 1994: 19-45. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his work addressed broad questions about values, such as: how are individuals’ priorities affected by social experiences?  How do individuals’ priorities influence their behavior and choices?  And, how do value priorities influence [[ideologies]], attitudes, and actions in political, religious, environmental, and other domains?  Through his studies, Schwartz concluded that ten types of universal values exist: achievement, benevolence, conformity, [[hedonism]], power, security, self-direction, stimulation, tradition, and [[universalism]].  Schwartz also tested the possibility of [[spirituality]] as an eleventh universal value, but found that it did not exist in all cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, Shalom H. “Universals in the Content and Structure of Values: Theoretical Advances and Empirical Tests in 20 Countries.”  ''Advances in Experimental Psychology.'' 1992: 1-65. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz's value theory and instruments are part of the biennial [[European Social Survey]].

=== Allport-Vernon-Lindzey ===

[[Gordon Allport]], a student of American [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]] [[Eduard Spranger]],&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G.W. “Becoming: Basic Considerations for a Psychology of Personality.” Yale University Press.  1955. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; believed that an individual’s [[philosophy]] is founded upon the values or basic convictions that a person holds about what is and is not important in life.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"&gt;Pomeroy, Leon and Rem B. Edwards. ''The New Science of Axiological Psychology.'' New York, NY: 2005. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Spranger’s (1928) view that understanding the individual’s value philosophy best captures the essence of a person, Allport and his colleagues, Vernon and Lindzey, created the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Study of Values.  The values scale outlined six major value types: theoretical (discovery of truth), economic (what is most useful), aesthetic (form, beauty, and harmony), social (seeking love of people), political (power), and religious (unity).  Forty years after the study’s publishing in 1960, it was the third most-cited non-projective personality measure.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt;

By 1980, the values scale had fallen into disuse due to its archaic content, lack of religious inclusiveness, and dated language. Richard E. Kopelman, et al., recently updated the Allport-Vernon-Lindzey Study of Values. The motivation behind their update was to make the value scale more relevant to today; they believed that the writing was too dated.  The updated, copyrighted version was published in ''[[Elsevier Science]]'' in 2003.  Today, permission is required for use.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2003"/&gt; (volume 62)

=== Hartman ===

[[Philosopher]] [[Robert S. Hartman]], creator of the [[Science of Value]], introduced and identified the concept of [[systematic values]], which he believed were an important addition to the previously studied intrinsic and extrinsic values.  He also made an illuminating distinction between ''what'' people value and ''how'' people value.  How people value parallels very closely with systematic values, which Hartman operationally defined as conceptual constructs or cognitive scripts that exist in people’s minds.  [[Ideal (ethics)|Ideal]]s, [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s, standards, rules, doctrines, and [[logic systems]] are all examples of systematic values.  If someone’s [[cognitive script]] is repetitively about violent actions, for instance, then that person is more likely to act vengefully and less likely to value peace.  With that additional idea in mind, Harman combined intrinsic, extrinsic, and systematic concepts to create the [[Hartman Value Profile]], also known as the [[Hartman Value Inventory]]. The profile consists of two parts. Each part contains 18 paired value-combination items, where nine of these items are positive and nine are negative.  The three different types of values, intrinsic, extrinsic, and systematic, can be combined positively or negatively with one another in 18 logically possible ways.  Depending on the combination, a certain value is either enhanced or diminished. Once the rankings are completed, the outcome is then compared to the theoretical norm, generating scores for psychological interpretation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

== Applications to psychology ==

Research surrounding understanding values serves as a framework for ideas in many other situations, such as counseling. [[Psychotherapists]], [[behavioral scientists]], and social scientists often deal with intrinsic, extrinsic, and systematic values of their patients.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, M.D. “Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck’s Values Orientation Theory.” ''Online Readings in Psychology and Culture.'' 2002. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; A primary way to learn about patients is to know what they value, as values are essential keys to personality structures.  This knowledge can pinpoint serious problems in living, aide immensely in planning therapeutic regimens, and measure therapeutic progress with applications of values scales over time, especially as [[social environments]] and [[social norms]] change.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2005"/&gt;

== Applications to business and marketing ==

Values are important in the construction of personal [[morality]] and as a basis for living life.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1985"/&gt; Recent literature suggests that social values are reflected in a large variety of advertisements and can influence audience reactions to advertising appeals.&lt;ref&gt;Hornikx, J., &amp; O’Keefe, D. J. (2009). Adapting consumer advertising appeals to cultural values: A meta-analytic review of effects on persuasiveness and ad liking. ''Annals of the International Communication Association, 33 (1),'' 38-71&lt;/ref&gt; When a choice is tied to a value, that choice then becomes more attractive to people who share that value.  [[Means-end chain analyses]] often find that consumers select products with attributes that deliver consequences, which in turn contribute to value fulfillment.  In short, people’s values resonate in and are observable throughout their daily lives.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; An example, presented in the ''[[Journal of Advertising Research]]'' by [[Eda Gurel-Atay]], is coffee.  People who endorse fun and enjoyment in life may want a cup of coffee for its rich, pleasant taste.  Meanwhile, people who value a sense of accomplishment may rather use coffee as a mild stimulant.  People who value warm, loving relationships with others may want a cup of coffee to share in a social manner.  Perspective and personal beliefs greatly influence behavior.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1976"/&gt;

Clawson and Vinson (1978) further elaborated on this idea by explaining how values are one of the most powerful explanations of, and influences on, [[consumer behavior]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"/&gt; Values scales are helpful in understanding several aspects of [[consumption areas]] and consumer behavior, including [[leisure]], [[Mass media|media]], and [[gift giving]].  People who endorse certain values more highly than others engage in certain activities, prefer certain programs or magazines, or give gifts differently from others. Values scales and the study of values could also be of interest to companies who are looking to build or strengthen their [[customer relationship management]].

==High school career==
Burfict attended [[Centennial High School (Corona, California)|Centennial High School]] in [[Corona, California]], where he was part of an undefeated Huskies team that won a [[California Interscholastic Federation|CIF]] title, a state championship with the help of quarterback [[Taylor Martinez]], and was ranked second in the nation by ''[[USA Today]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=December 22, 2008 |title=Fort Lauderdale's Aquinas finishes season atop Super 25 |newspaper=USA Today |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/preps/football/poll/2008-super25.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Burfict led the Huskies with 159 [[Tackle (football move)|tackles]], two [[quarterback sack]]s, two [[interception]]s and two [[Fumble (American football)|fumble]] recoveries. Burfict participated in the [[US Army All-American Bowl]] and was the third-leading tackler for the West team.

As a junior, Burfict collected a team-high 130 tackles and added four sacks, two interceptions and one fumble recovery. He helped anchor a linebackers unit that included fellow Sun Devils Shelly Lyons and [[Brandon Magee]].

By midseason, Burfict ranked second in the team with 30 tackles despite starting only three of six games, and had five tackles for a loss, two sacks, and three pass break-ups.

At the start of his sophomore season, Burfict was named First-Team Preseason All-American by ''[[The Sporting News]]''. He was also named to the watchlists of the 2010 [[Rotary Lombardi Award]] and the [[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://thesundevils.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/062210aaa.html |title=ASU's Vontaze Burfict Named First-Team All-American By Sporting News |work=ASU Athletics Football |date=June 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2010, Burfict was benched by Arizona State head coach Dennis Erickson. The reason given was Burfict's unusually high number of personal foul penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/asu/articles/2010/10/05/20101005arizona-state-football-burfict-benched.html |title=Dennis Erickson takes Vontaze Burfict out of Arizona State starting lineup vs. Washington |first=Jeff |last=Metcalfe |date=October 5, 2010 |newspaper=The Arizona Republic }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a game against [[2010 Stanford Cardinal football team|Stanford]], Burfict was called for grabbing the facemask of [[Doug Baldwin]], and—after complaining to the referee—charged with a personal foul for unsportsmanlike conduct that gave Stanford a first down at the ASU 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Youtube|sjxxWFNJN-U|Highlights: (6) Stanford - ASU}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two plays later, Stanford scored what turned out to be the winning touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.azcentral.com/sports/asu/articles/2010/11/13/20101113asu-vontaze-burfict-mistakes.html |title=ASU football team sees spirited effort derailed by Vontaze Burfict's mistakes |work=The Arizona Republic |date=November 13, 2010 |first=Paola |last=Boivin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==

===2012 NFL Draft===
When he entered his junior season, Burfict was regarded as one of the best linebackers available in the [[2012 NFL Draft]], projected to go as high as the fifth pick.&lt;ref name="Prisco2012early"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/15014424/flash-forward-top-32-picks-for-the-2012-nfl-draft |title=Flash forward: Top 32 picks for the 2012 NFL Draft |date=May 1, 2011 |work=[[CBSSports.com]] |first=Pete |last=Prisco }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauline2012early"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/football/nfl/05/03/2012.prospects/ |title=Stanford's Luck headlines early look at top 2012 draft prospects |work=Sports Illustrated |date=May 3, 2011 |first=Tony |last=Pauline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuter2012early"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/story/15029593/mock-draft-first-look-with-luck-and-heels |title=2012 mock draft: First look with Luck and Heels |work=CBSSports.com |date=May 4, 2011 |first=Chad |last=Reuter }}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems on and off the field at Arizona State, however, caused his draft stock to plummet. In October 2011, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''′s Tony Pauline still ranked him as the No. 20 prospect on his midseason draft board, but noted that he has been "a loose cannon on and off the field, which has raised red flags."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/tony_pauline/10/24/top.50/ |title=Andrew Luck, Trent Richardson high in midseason NFL draft rankings |date=October 24, 2011 |work=SI.com |first=Tony |last=Pauline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burfict entered the [[NFL Combine]] rated as the third best inside linebacker, behind [[Luke Kuechly]] and [[Dont'a Hightower]], but his "disappointing" performance—including a 5.09 sec in the [[40-yard dash]], slowest among linebackers—caused some analysts to project him as a third day (Rd. 4-7) draft pick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rob-rang.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/13682485/35011522 |title=Lackluster Combine could push Burfict to Day 3 |work=CBS Sports |first=Rob |last=Rang |date=February 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/don_banks/02/29/combine.awards/index.html?xid=si_nfl |title=Andrew Luck, Stephen Hill, Vontaze Burfict make their mark on NFL combine |first=Don |last=Banks |work=SI.com |date=February 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NFL scouts also faulted him for his interview process, in which he blamed the Arizona State coaching staff for his mediocre junior season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://bruce-feldman.blogs.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/31626208/35006810 |work=CBS Sports |first=Bruce |last=Feldman |date=February 27, 2012 |title=Burfict from yellow flags to red ones?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later it was also reported that Burfict tested positive for [[marijuana]] at the combine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/arizona|title=Arizona|first=Fox|last=Sports|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 season===
An undrafted rookie, Burfict managed to make the Cincinnati Bengals' roster. He played in all 16 games and started 14 of those, finishing the seasons as the Bengals' top tackler with 127 combined tackles, including 18 tackles in their final game of the year against their divisional rival [[2012 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]].

Burfict also topped the list for the NFL'Performance-Based Pay' program with earning $299,465.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap1000000152307/article/vontaze-burfict-earns-top-figure-in-performancebased-pay|title=Vontaze Burfict earns top figure in 'Performance-Based Pay'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2016, in the AFC Wild Card Round against the Steelers, Burfict committed a critical penalty with 18 seconds left in the fourth quarter, when the Bengals were leading Pittsburgh 16-15. Ben Roethlisberger had reentered the game, drove from inside his own 10 yard line, and crossed midfield into Bengals territory. The penalty, which was for an illegal hit to the head on [[Antonio Brown]] after Brown had converted a 4th and 3 for a 1st down into Bengal territory, which together with a second personal foul by [[Adam Jones (American football)|Adam Jones]] positioned Pittsburgh to kick a go-ahead field goal and win the game, 18-16, and advance to the divisional round against the [[Denver Broncos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vontaze Burfict, Pacman Jones commit two personal fouls to give Steelers game-winner|url = https://www.sbnation.com/2016/1/9/10743832/vontaze-burfict-pacman-jones-awful-personal-fouls-hand-steelers-game|website = SBNation.com|accessdate = 2016-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 11, the NFL announced that Burfict would be suspended for the first three games of the 2016 season for repeated violations of player safety rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/bengals--vontaze-burfict-suspended-first-three-games-of-2016-005521943.html|title=Bengals’ Vontaze Burfict suspended three games, plans to appeal|website=Yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (GOP) won the majority in the House of Representatives. On January 4, 2011, the day after Congress convened, Kaili Joy Gray of the liberal [[Daily Kos]] wrote an opinion piece titled "The Coming War on Women".&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Kaili Joy|title=The Coming War on Women|url=http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2011/01/03/coming-women|newspaper=Daily Kos|date=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, she outlined many of the measures that Republicans intended to push through the House of Representatives, including [[personhood]] laws, [[fetal pain]] laws, and the effort to defund Planned Parenthood.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt; In February 2011, an AlterNet article by Sarah Seltzer and Lauren Kelley entitled "9 New laws in the GOP's War on Women" &lt;ref name="Seltzer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Seltzer|first=Sarah|author2=Kelley, Lauren |title=9 New Laws in the GOP's War on Women|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/149761/9_new_laws_in_the_gop's_war_against_women|newspaper=AlterNet|date=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to document state-level legislation restricting abortion access and rights. That same month, New York Representative [[Jerrold Nadler]] referred to the proposed [[No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act]], one of the Congress's first actions and one that would have changed policy to allow only victims of "forcible rape" or child sex abuse to qualify for Medicaid funding for abortion, as "an entirely new front in the war on women and their families".&lt;ref name="Weigel"&gt;{{cite news|last=Weigel|first=David|title=The "War on Women" Is Over|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/04/hilary_rosen_ann_romney_the_birth_adolescence_and_death_of_the_democrats_war_on_women_talking_point_.single.html|newspaper=Slate|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florida Representative and Chair of the [[Democratic National Committee]] [[Debbie Wasserman Schultz]] began using the term "War on Women" in March 2011.&lt;ref name="Weigel"/&gt;

=== Reproductive rights ===
[[Image:Guttmacher Abortion Restrictions.SVG|thumb|240px|Zerlina Maxwell, in an editorial for ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', cited these figures from the Guttmacher Institute as evidence of a "war on American women".&lt;ref name=fiction/&gt; The findings, according to the Guttmacher Institute, show that state restrictions on abortion greatly increased in 2011.&lt;ref name="Guttmacher2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guttmacher Institute"/&gt;&lt;ref name=gold/&gt;]]
{{main|Reproductive rights}}
The "War on Women" slogan was used often when describing the unprecedented rise in the passage of provisions related to women's health and reproductive rights in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref name="Guttmacher2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guttmacher Institute"&gt;{{cite web|title=State Policy Trends: Abortion and Contraception in the Crosshairs|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2012/04/13/index.html|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|date=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, state legislatures across the United States introduced over 1100 provisions related to women's health and reproductive rights,&lt;ref name="Guttmacher2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=States Enact Record Number of Abortion Restrictions in 2011|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/media/inthenews/2012/01/05/endofyear.html|publisher=Guttmacher Institute|date=January 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lithwick|first=Dahlia|title=The Faux Mommy Wars|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/04/presidential_election_season_conservatives_are_manufacturing_the_war_on_women_for_political_gain_.2.html|newspaper=Slate|date=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the first quarter of 2012 an additional 944 provisions were introduced in state legislatures, half of which would restrict access to abortion.

Democratic strategist [[Zerlina Maxwell]] wrote an editorial for ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' in which she cited a Guttmacher Institute analysis showing state legislatures enacted 135 pieces of legislation affecting women's reproductive rights as evidence that the "Republican 'War on Women' is no fiction."&lt;ref name=fiction&gt;{{cite news|last=Maxwell|first=Zerlina|title=Reproductive Health Laws Prove GOP 'War on Women' Is No Fiction|url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/is-there-a-republican-war-on-women/reproductive-health-laws-prove-gop-war-on-women-is-no-fiction|newspaper=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis found that between 2000 and 2011, the number of states hostile to [[abortion rights]] have increased markedly, and that in 2011 there was an unprecedented rise in the number of provisions passed by state legislatures restricting abortion.&lt;ref name=gold&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gold|first=Rachel Benson|author2=Nash, Elizabeth |title=Troubling Trend: More States Hostile to Abortion Rights as Middle Ground Shrinks|journal=Guttmacher Policy Review|date=Winter 2012|volume=15|issue=1|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/gpr/15/1/gpr150114.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Mandatory ultrasounds =====
[[Image:Embryo at 14 weeks profile.JPG|thumb|right|Ultrasound of fetus at 14 weeks (profile)]]
In 2011 and 2012, "War on Women" was used to describe the legislation passed by many states requiring that women seeking abortions first undergo government-mandated [[Obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/terry-oneill/mandatory-ultrasound-laws_b_1300219.html|title=Mandatory Ultrasound Laws Violate Women's Rights and Bodies|publisher=The Huffington Post|first=Terry |last=O'Neill|date=Feb 2, 2012|accessdate=Dec 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states require that women view the image of the fetus and others [[Fetal heartbeat bill|require that women be offered the opportunity]] to listen to the fetal heartbeat. Since many women's pregnancies are not far enough along to get an image via a traditional ultrasound, [[transvaginal ultrasound]]s, which involve the physician inserting a probe into the woman's vagina, may be required, but these requirements vary state to state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_RFU.pdf | title=State Policies in Brief: Requirement for Ultrasound | website=[[Guttmacher Institute]] | date=1 January 2014 | accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/updates/2012/statetrends12012.html | title=Laws Affecting Reproductive Health and Rights: Trends in the First Quarter of 2012 | website=[[Guttmacher Institute]] | accessdate=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have questioned the value of having a medically unnecessary procedure, and characterized it as similar to some states' legal definition of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kristof|first=Nicholas D.|title=When States Abuse Women|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/opinion/sunday/kristof-when-states-abuse-women.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Megan Carpentier underwent the procedure and indicated that although it was not comparable to being raped, the process was "uncomfortable to the point of being painful, emotionally triggering... and something that no government should force its citizens to undergo to make a political point."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carpentier|first=Megan|title=I had a transvaginal ultrasound: My perspective on the mandate that touched off 2012′s War On Women|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/17/i-had-a-transvaginal-ultrasound-my-perspective-on-the-mandate-that-touched-off-2012s-war-on-women/|newspaper=The Raw Story|date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowder|first=J.

In 2011, voters in Mississippi rejected Initiative 26, a measure that would have declared that human life begins at fertilization, which had drawn support from conservative Republicans and Democrats.

The program had been running a surplus, primarily due to decreases in the cost of milk, which make up 20% of WIC expenditures, and lower participation than expected.&lt;ref name="cnnwic"/&gt; WIC's budget was later cut by 5.2% as part of the bipartisan [[budget sequestration in 2013]].&lt;ref name="cnnwic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wpwic"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/02/20/the-sequester-absolutely-everything-you-could-possibly-need-to-know-in-one-faq/|title=The Sequester: Absolutely everything you could possibly need to know, in one FAQ|publisher=The Washington Post|date=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Workplace and pay discrimination ===
In April 2012, [[Governor of Wisconsin|Governor]] [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]]'s repeal of Wisconsin's ''Equal Pay Enforcement Act'' was described by opponents as furthering the "War on Women", which became a big issue in his recall election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/17/scott-walker-recall-war-women_n_1431143.html|title=Scott Walker Recall: 'War On Women' Fight Becomes Big Issue In Election|publisher=The Huffington Post| date=April 17, 2012|first=Amanda|last=Terkel}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Equal Pay Enforcement Act'' was passed in 2009 in response to the large gap between the wages of men and women in Wisconsin. Among other provisions, it allowed workplace discrimination victims redress in the less costly and more accessible state court system, rather than in federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Michelle|title=Wisconsin's Repeal of Equal Pay Rights Adds to Battles for Women|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/04/07/wisconsin-s-repeal-of-equal-pay-rights-adds-to-battles-for-women.html|newspaper=The Daily Beast|date=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyler|first=Grace|title=Wisconsin Republican: Women Are Paid Less Because 'Money Is More Important For Men'|url=http://articles.businessinsider.com/2012-04-09/politics/31311795_1_wage-gaps-wage-discrimination-daily-beast|newspaper=Business Insider|date=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defending the repeal, Walker stated that the Act had essentially been nothing but a boon for trial lawyers, incentivizing them to sue job creators, including female business owners, and that the law was being used to clog up the legal system in his state.&lt;ref name="walkerEPEA"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/23/scott-walker-wisconsin-equal-pay-repeal_n_1445674.html|title=Scott Walker Pressed For Answers On Wisconsin Equal Pay Law Repeal|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=April 23, 2012|first=Amanda|last=Terkel}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is still illegal in Wisconsin to pay women less on the basis of their sex,&lt;ref name="walkerEPEA" /&gt; the repeal was criticized for reinforcing the [[gender pay gap]], a recurrent theme in the struggle for women's rights. Republican State Senator [[Glenn Grothman]] said of the repeal, "You could argue that money is more important for men. I think a guy in their first job, maybe because they expect to be a breadwinner someday, may be a little more money-conscious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shahid |first=Aliyah |title=Wisconsin GOPer: Women make less because 'Money is more important for men' |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-04-11/news/31326804_1_wage-gap-wage-bill-discrimination |newspaper=New York Daily News |date=April 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504122611/http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-04-11/news/31326804_1_wage-gap-wage-bill-discrimination |archivedate=May 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Law student [[Sandra Fluke]], criticized Grothman's comment, highlighting legislation that supports equal pay for equal work, such as the federal ''[[Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fluke|first=Sandra|title=Who says women don't care about wages?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/17/opinion/fluke-equal-pay-for-women/index.html|newspaper=CNN|date=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public opinion ==
A May 2012 [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] poll found that 31 percent of women and 28 percent of men believed there was an ongoing and wide-scale effort to "limit women's reproductive health choices and services".&lt;ref name="huffpo1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kaiser1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kaiserfamilyfoundation.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/8315-f.pdf | title=Kaiser Health Tracking Poll | publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]] | date=May 2012 | accessdate=27 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 45 percent of women and 44 percent of men responded that some groups would like to limit these choices and services, but it's not wide‐scale.&lt;ref name="kaiser1"/&gt; Democrats were more likely than Republicans to say there is a movement, but the largest gap was between liberal and conservative ideologies.&lt;ref name="kaiser1"/&gt; Among those women believing these efforts to be wide-scale, 75 percent saw this as "a bad thing" against 16 percent who saw this as "a good thing".&lt;ref name="kaiser1"/&gt; In the same poll, 42 percent of women and men have said they have taken some action in response to what they heard regarding reproductive health issues.&lt;ref name="huffpo1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kaiser1"/&gt;

"A myopic focus on reproductive freedom and the 'War on the Women' does not seem to be an effective way to mobilize and motivate women in a year when the economy and jobs are at the forefront of voters' minds, and GOP candidates have not made the same kinds of mistakes that Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock did in 2012," says Jennifer Lawless, director of American University's Women &amp; Politics Institute.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/11/05/how-mark-uterus-lost-in-colorado/|title=How 'Mark Uterus' lost in Colorado|date=5 Nov 2014|author=Nia-Malika Henderson|website=Washington Post|quote=For the "war on women" message to actually be effective for Democratic candidates, one key thing has to happen: Women have to show up and vote for Democrats in larger numbers than men.

===2016 Presidential candidates===
Political analysts have interpreted the [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign]] as appealing to a female constituency, and have used the phrase "war on women" to describe Republican opposition.&lt;ref name=thinkprogress2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/29/politics/hillary-clinton-women-gender-planned-parenthood/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/03/20/hillary-s-ready-for-the-war-on-women.html|title=Hillary's Ready for the 'War on Women'|website=The Daily Beast}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/09/gop-war-on-women-in-congress-213209|title=The House GOP's War on Women|author=Elijah Cummings|author-link=Elijah Cummings|date=30 Sep 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican presidential candidate [[Carly Fiorina]] said "If Hillary Clinton were to face a female nominee, there are a whole set of things that she won't be able to talk about. She won't be able to talk about being the first woman president. She won't be able to talk about a war on women without being challenged.

[[Donald Trump]], a [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Republican candidate for the 2016 Presidency]] attended a Fox News debate in August 2015, where [[Megyn Kelly]] asked him about how he would respond to a [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2016|Hillary Clinton campaign]] saying that he was waging a "war on women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOqtra7j6UM|title=Is Donald Trump part of the 'war on women'? - Fox News Republican Debate|date=August 6, 2015|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/08/07/us-usa-election-trump-women-idUSKCN0QC04W20150807|title=Trump draws boos as he bristles at 'war on women' question|website=Reuters|date=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview with [[Don Lemon]] on ''[[CNN Tonight]]'', Trump said that Kelly is a "lightweight" and had "blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/08/politics/donald-trump-cnn-megyn-kelly-comment/index.html|title=Trump draws outrage after Megyn Kelly remarks - CNNPolitics.com|author=Holly Yan, CNN|date=August 8, 2015|website=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-33833516|title=Donald Trump axed from event over Megyn Kelly blood comment|website=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump tweeted that his remark referred to Kelly's "nose" but was interpreted by critics as a reference to [[menstruation]].

== Reaction ==

=== Response from Republicans ===
Critics of the term have denied that a War on Women exists and some have suggested that it is a ploy to influence women voters. [[Reince Priebus]], the Chairman of the [[Republican National Committee|RNC]], referred to the War as a "fiction", saying "If the Democrats said we had a war on caterpillars and every mainstream media outlet talked about the fact that Republicans have a war on caterpillars, then we'd have problems with caterpillars."&lt;ref name="caterpillars"&gt;{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=David|title=RNC chair: GOP 'war on women' fictional like 'war on caterpillars'|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/04/05/rnc-chair-gop-war-on-women-fictional-like-war-on-caterpillars/|newspaper=The Raw Story|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Benen|first=Steve|title=RNC chairman reflects on women, caterpillars|url=http://maddowblog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/04/05/11035818-rnc-chairman-reflects-on-women-caterpillars|newspaper=The Maddow Blog|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jensen|first=Kristin|title=Priebus Says Gender Battle Fictional as Caterpillar War|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-05/priebus-says-gender-battle-as-fictonal-as-caterpillar-war|newspaper=Businessweek|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Republican Representative [[Cathy McMorris Rodgers]] called the war a myth, saying "It's an effort to drive a political wedge in an election year." Referring to the 2010 elections and [[Nancy Pelosi]], she said that "It could be argued that the women actually unelected the first woman Speaker of the House."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dennis|first=Steven T.|title=Hill Women Play Starring Role in 'Mommy Wars'|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/hill-women-play-starring-role-mommy-wars-213960-1.html?pos=htmbtxt|newspaper=Roll Call|date=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/18/us-usa-campaign-rodgers-idUSBRE84H0YD20120518|title=Top Republican woman in Congress becomes a force|website=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Carolina Governor [[Nikki Haley]] said in 2012 "There is no war on women.

Senator [[John McCain]], when asked by journalist [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] if there was a Republican War on Women, said "I think that there is a perception out there because of how this whole contraception issue played out — ah, we need to get off of that issue, in my view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbert|first=Kathleen|title=McCain decries GOP fight against Obama mandate: 'we need to get off that issue'|url=http://www.lifesitenews.com/news/mccain-decries-gop-fight-against-obama-mandate-we-need-to-get-off-that-issu/|newspaper=LifeSiteNews.com|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican Senator [[Lisa Murkowski]] countered the criticism from her fellow party members, challenging them to "go home and talk to your wife and your daughters" if they did not think there was a war on women, saying "It makes no sense to make this attack on women."&lt;ref name="Murkowski"/&gt;

After the [[Rape and pregnancy controversies in United States elections, 2012|2012 rape and pregnancy controversies]], Republican strategists met with aides of Republican figures to advise them on how to run against female candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/12/gop-men-tutored-in-running-against-women-100701|title=GOP men told how to talk to women|author=Anna Plamer|date=12 May 2013|website=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/gop-war-on-women-105453|author=Anna Palmer|date=4 Aug 2014|title=GOP solution to 'war on women'|website=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Democratic sexual harassment scandals ===
Members of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], both prominent and local, have been accused of participating in the war on women. In a column for ''[[USA Today]]'', [[Glenn Reynolds]] wrote in July 2013 that "most of the action in the war on women seems to be coming from the Democratic front," referring to the allegations of sexual harassment against [[San Diego]] mayor [[Bob Filner#Allegations of sexual harassment|Bob Filner]], the [[Anthony Weiner sexting scandal]], and the [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;''USA Today'': [https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2013/07/29/women-harassment-filner-weiner-sydney-leathers-column/2594213/ The latest in the war on women]. July 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republican National Senatorial Committee]] has also used these scandals in press releases, tying Democratic Senators in [[Iowa]] and [[New Hampshire]] to the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;NRSC Press Release: [http://www.iowagop.org/war-on-women-bruce-braley-silent-as-fellow-democrats-mistreat-women/ Republican Party of Iowa].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''NH Journal'': [http://nhjournal.com/2013/07/23/nrsc-dings-shaheen-over-war-on-women/ NRSC dings Shaheen over 'war on women'.] July 23, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The messaging from Republicans was described as unlikely to be effective by Garance Franke-Ruta in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' because "[the War on Women] was an argument about Republican policies on women ... rather than about reprehensible individual behavior." Noting that many of the targets are not on upcoming ballots, Franke-Ruta continued by saying the Republican Party "is going to need its own pro-active framework for thinking about what is happening in America and why women have been drawn to Democrats in numbers that matter in key elections."&lt;ref name="Atlantic" /&gt;

=== Other reactions ===
[[Jonathan Alter]] characterized the phrase as an "alliteratve but unfair notion".&lt;ref&gt;Alter, Jonathan, ''The Center Holds: Obama and His Enemies'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1st Simon &amp; Schuster hardcover ed. 2013 ({{ISBN|978-1-4516-4607-8}})), p.&amp;nbsp;281 (author columnist, ''Bloomberg Voice'', analyst &amp; contributing ed., NBC News &amp; MSNBC, &amp; former sr. ed. &amp; columnist, ''Newsweek'').&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Weigel]] called for "a moment of silence" in his article entitled "The 'War on Women' Is Over: The life cycle of a political talking point, from birth to adolescence to death." In it he explained his understanding of the stages in the "life cycle" of the Democratic "talking point".&lt;ref name="Weigel" /&gt;

Molly Redden wrote an article for ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' entitled "The War on Women is Over -- and Women Lost". She described the difficulties faced by abortion providers: "Activists have been calling it the 'war on women.' But the onslaught of new abortion restrictions has been so successful, so strategically designed, and so well coordinated that the war in many places has essentially been lost."&lt;ref name=Redden &gt;{{Citation | last =Redden | first =Molly | author-link = | date=September 1, 2015 |title=The War on Women is Over -- and Women Lost.
