'''''A Landscape with a Ruined Castle and a Church''''' (c. 1665) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[National Gallery]].
== Description ==
This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1911, who wrote; "136. Landscape with Cornfields, and Sheep and Figures. 
[[John Smith (art historian)|Sm. 214.]] A far-reaching view across an open plain varied with woods, meadows, and cornfields, villages and churches amid trees, cottages and 
windmills. In front are the ruins of a castle with a stagnant moat, fringed with trees and underwood. On the left a winding road passes a cornfield with sheaves and a group of trees and is lost in the distance. A shepherd sits on the old castle-wall, conversing with a youth seated on the ground, near a dog and three sheep. On a bastion, on the other side, are three sheep ; in a breach of the bastion stands a man. On a pool are three swans. The figures and cattle are by [[Adriaen van de Velde|A. van de Velde]]. A thunderstorm has just passed over. In the sky are masses of rolling cloud, through which sunbeams fall on windmills in the distance. The rest of the landscape is in partial shadow. "This capital picture may be cited as a chef d'oeuvre of the artist in this peculiar department of landscape-painting " (Sm.). [Compare 775, 776.] Canvas, 43 inches by 57 inches. Exhibited at Manchester, 1857, No. 699, by R. Sanderson. Sale. [[Jan Gildemeester]], Amsterdam, June 11, 1800, No. 190 (315 florins, 
Tays). In the collection of the Marquis de Marialva, Paris, 1825 ; bought privately by Sm. Sales. John Smith, London, 1828 (£472 : 10s.). 
Abrahams, London, 1831 (£275). In the collection of Richard Sanderson, London, 1835 (Sm.). Sale. R. Sanderson, London, June 17, 1848 (£504, Brown) ; but apparently 
bought in, for it was in the Sanderson collection in 1854 ([[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Waagen]], ii. 288), and was lent from it to Manchester in 1857. "&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn04hofsuoft#page/48/mode/1up  Entry 136 for ''''Landscape with Cornfields, and Sheep and Figures''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene is very similar to other paintings Ruisdael made in this period.

The '''All-Union Art Exhibition (Moscow, 1957)''' devoted to the 40th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]] ({{lang-ru|italic=yes|Всесоюзная художественная выставка, посвящённая 40-летию Великой Октябрьской социалистической революции}}) was one of the largest art exhibitions in Soviet history. Exhibition took place in [[Moscow Manege|Manezh Exhibition Hall]] from November 5, 1957 to May, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;''Грабарь И. Заметки о живописи на Всесоюзной художественной выставке 1957 года.'' // Искусство, 1958, №1. С.14-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and Organization ==
The organization and preparation of the All-Union Exhibition engaged a specially formed Exhibition Committee, which consisted of the most authoritative art experts. It published an illustrated catalog of the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;''Всесоюзная художественная выставка, посвященная 40-летию Великой Октябрьской социалистической революции. Живопись. Скульптура. Графика. Работы художников театра и кино. Каталог.'' — М: Министерство культуры СССР, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Manezh, the exposition has been deployed in other exhibition halls of Moscow: in the USSR Academy of Arts, in the House of Artists, in the Exhibition Hall of the Union of Artists of the USSR, and in other halls of the Soviet capital.&lt;ref&gt;''Выставки советского изобразительного искусства. Справочник. Том 5. 1954—1958 годы.'' — М: Советский художник, 1981. — с.370-379.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, the Exhibition displayed more than 8,000 works of art, including more than 1,600 paintings, 700 sculptures, and 2,000 graphic works.&lt;ref&gt;''На Всесоюзной художественной выставке'' // Правда, 1957, 8 декабря.&lt;/ref&gt; The Exhibition was visited by over 1 million people. Many art works were purchased for the largest Soviet art museums, including the [[Russian Museum]], the [[Tretyakov Gallery]], and others. After the Exhibition in Moscow five traveling exhibitions were organized, which were shown in the capitals of the Union Republics and major cities.

For display at the Exhibition were selected art works created in 1957, as well as some earlier works. Many of them were previously shown at the city, regional and republic art exhibitions in 1957. Many of them were subsequently found in the collections of Soviet art museums, as well as domestic and foreign galleries and collectors. Among them there were paintings of historical genres such as ''Volley "Aurora"'' by [[Aleksandr Gerasimov (painter)|Aleksandr Gerasimov]], ''"First Cavalry Army"'' by [[Evsey Moiseenko]],&lt;ref&gt;''Недошивин Г.

'''''Alone in the World''''' ({{lang-fr|Seule au Monde}}) is a painting created by nineteenth-century French artist [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]. Although the exact year of creation is unknown, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo van Gogh]] acquired it in 1867 so it may be placed in the early part of Bouguereau's career.&lt;ref name="wissman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wissman |first=Fronia E. |title=Bouguereau |publisher=Pomegranate Artbooks |location=San Francisco |date=1996 |page= |isbn=978-0876545829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting depicts a peasant girl holding a [[violin]] and standing on a bridge over the [[Seine]] in Paris.  She is looking to her left with a melancholy expression.  The cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] can be seen in the background, as well as a bridge which appears to be the [[Pont Royal]].  This indicates that the girl is standing on the [[Pont de Solférino]].

'''An Ecosystem of Excess''' is an art project by artist and researcher [[Pinar Yoldas]]. The project addresses a series of ecological problems such as man-made [[extreme environments]], [[consumer capitalism]], [[plastic pollution]] and [[threatened species]] in the age of the [[Anthropocene]]. Yoldas was awarded the Ernst Schering Foundation Arts &amp; Culture Grant for her project, and An Ecosystem of Excess was premiered in Ernst Schering Project Space in Berlin in 2014.&lt;ref name="Ernst Schering"&gt;[http://www.scheringstiftung.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2761%3Apinar-yoldas-an-ecosystem-of-excess&amp;catid=65%3Arueckschau&amp;Itemid=151&amp;lang=en "Pinar Yoldas: An Ecosystem of Excess"], ''Ernst Schering Foundation'', Retrieved 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is an artistic imagination of a post-anthropocene [[ecosystem]] where non-human living creatures are evolved to digest plastic while human species goes extinct. It portrays the future story of alien life forms that emerge from the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]], in the form of a [[dystopian]] re-staging of [[Abiogenesis]]. For the project, Yoldas worked with [[marine biologist]] [[Sylvia Earle]] .&lt;ref name="Style Park"&gt;[https://www.stylepark.com/en/news/welcome-to-the-plastivorizene "Welcome to the Plastivorizene"], ''Stylepark'', Retrieved 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
An Ecosystem of Excess is a work informed by scientific research which confirms the emergence of new bacteria which adapt to plastic environments or what is scientifically called the [[plastisphere]], yet, it is a product of speculative fiction that takes inspiration but departs from science.&lt;ref name="Aksioma"&gt;[http://aksioma.org/ecosystem.of.excess "Pinar Yoldas: An Ecosystem of Excess"], ''Aksioma'', Retrieved 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Environmental Science and Technology Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zettler|first1=Erik R.|last2=Mincer|first2=Tracy J.|last3=Amaral-Zettler|first3=Linda A.|title=Life in the "Plastisphere": Microbial Communities on Plastic Marine Debris|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|date=June 7, 2013|volume=47|issue=13|pages=7137–7146|doi=10.1021/es401288x|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es401288x/|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=Miriam C.|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Marci|last3=Cheng|first3=Lanna|title=Increased oceanic microplastic debris enhances oviposition in an endemic pelagic insect|journal=Biology Letters|date=May 9, 2012|volume=8|issue=5|pages=817–820.|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2012.0298|pmc=3440973|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It points to evolution and how this process is indirectly altered by human intervention in the age of [[Anthropocene]].&lt;ref name="Digicult"&gt;[http://www.digicult.it/news/shaping-alternative-futures-interview-pinar-yoldas/ "Shaping Alternative Futures: Interview with Pinar Yoldas], ''Digicult'', Retrieved 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The work involves a creative exaggeration of scientific facts, and more generally, a research about "the collaborative potential between art and biological sciences."&lt;ref name="UCLA"&gt;[http://cdh.ucla.edu/event/dma-lecture-pinar-yoldas/ "Digital Humanities Lecture: Pinar Yoldas"], ''UCLA Center for Digital Humanities'', Retrieved 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist-theorists [[Zach Blas]] and Christopher O'Leary describe the work as a design of "synthetic biological systems as a living critique of our society." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blas|first1=Zach|last2=O'Leary|first2=Christopher|title=Speculative (exhibition catalogue)|date=2011|page=114|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=igQ9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781257799800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Abstract.gif|right|thumb|The oil painting ''Earth and Sky'' has greeted visitors to '''Art.Net''' since June, 1994]]
'''Art.Net''' is a [[non-profit]]  {{citation needed|date=June 2008}} web-based [[artist collective]] of more than 450 [[artist]]s, [[poet]]s, [[musician]]s, [[Painting|painter]]s, [[Sculpture|sculptor]]s, [[animator]]s, [[hacker artist]]s, and other creative people from around the world, aimed at helping artists share their works on the [[World Wide Web]]. Also known as '''Art on the Net,''' the site was established in June, 1994 with a manifesto and statement of purpose as an [[Internet art]] project site and [[Art gallery#Online galleries|online art gallery]].

[[Artist]]s create and maintain studio web spaces on the site and gallery pages where they show their works and share information about themselves. Artists are also encouraged to collaborate and to help each other promote and improve their art. They can learn how to [[curate]] and show their art work via the web. Several member artists also teach art in their studio spaces located on Art.Net.&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.net/studios/visual/Rebecca/LifeDrawing1.html ''Life Drawing Lesson I, Gesture - The Foundation of Figurative Art''] by Rebecca Alzofon accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.net/thegallery/Maurel_Room/collab.html Master Printer, Sheila Marbain demonstrates the execution of creating an encaustic monoprint] in an [http://www.art.net/ Art.Net Gallery Room], accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.net/thegallery/Maurel_Room/maurel.html ''Silk Monoprinting''] by Sheila Marbain accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Art.Net is open to new artists and new areas. [http://www.art.net/join/ New artists are invited to join and submit their work for display.] The site provides and supports a variety of online art resources.&lt;ref name="AwardsReceived"&gt;[http://art.net/Links/Artref/artref.html Awards Received] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Art.Net is owned and operated by the member artists, and has been active in defending [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] on the [[Internet]]. With the help of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), Art.Net has been involved in many court cases defending freedom of speech on the Internet. In each case, members were asked to testify in court about how laws censoring content on the Internet prevented the sharing of art due to fear of prosecution. There have been four such cases, in four different states.  Each was successful in bringing injunctions against laws, preventing their enforcement. This happened during the time that each state was trying to create local [[Communications Decency Act]] (CDA) laws for their local states.&lt;ref name="Fahrenheit451.2"&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/15145pub20020317.html "Fahrenheit 451.2: Is Cyberspace Burning?" ACLU (2002)] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The website does not censor the artists or their works posted on the site; artists are requested to share their art in a non-commercial way. Artists retain all rights to their works shown on Art.Net. The site typically receives more than 65,000 page views per day from more than 14,000 unique visitors. It has won several awards.&lt;ref name="AwardsReceived"/&gt;

==Protector of the arts and artists==

In the autumn of 1994, Art.Net suffered its first site break-in by the well known
[[white hat (computer security)|black hat and cracker]], [[Kevin Mitnick]]. This break-in was the beginning of Mitnick's downfall.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} Art.Net's webmaster requested the help of a master [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]], [[Tsutomu Shimomura]], to deal with the cracker. The break-in was discovered "while in process" and Art.Net immediately responded by turning off all Internet services except for web access via httpd.

In the fall of 1995, Art.Net executed one of the first known reversed Web 
[[Denial-of-service attack|"Denial of Service" (aka DOS) attacks]].{{citation needed|date=August 2007}} A porn site had linked to one image of an Art.Net member artist's art on Art.Net without the artist's permission. When the artist noticed that the file was being accessed more than usual (several thousand times a day), she reported the strange event to the Art.Net site webmaster. The art image file was moved to another filename and by way of the [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache webserver]] running on Art.Net, accesses to the original file name were redirected back to the offending website's sendmail port. The offending machine went down in a few minutes due to the overload of sendmail connections to their site. A few days later the offending link to the art was removed from the porn site.

==Selected historical milestones==
'''June, 1994''' - established.

'''February, 1996''' - joined in the [[Black World Wide Web protest]]
from February 8 until February 24 to protest the signing of the telecommunications bill that included the CDA by Bill Clinton on February 8, 1996 as part of the [[Blue Ribbon Online Free Speech Campaign]]. Art.Net continued showing the Blue Ribbon on site entrance page to show support of freedom of speech on the Internet.

'''June, 1996''' - new link submission form&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art.net/links/linksform.html Link Submission Form] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
was added on the site.

'''March, 1997''' - joined in the lawsuit ''[[American Library Association|ALA]] v. Pataki'' as a plaintiff to challenge [[New York (state)|New York]]'s Internet censorship law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/15510res19970620.html ''ALA v. Pataki''] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Art.Net
was placed in jeopardy to help defend freedom of speech on the Internet by joining this case. If it had lost, there would have been a strong chance that the site must shut down because of censorship laws. Represented by the ACLU, the case was won for the plaintiffs Art.Net and many others, and a preliminary injunction against New York's censorship law, preserving freedom of speech on the Internet, was issued.

'''June, 1998''' - joined in the lawsuit ''ACLU v. Johnson'' as a plaintiff to challenge [[New Mexico]]'s online censorship law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/15687res19980627.html ''ACLU v. Johnson''] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This was 
an important case because even though the ACLU won,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/15530lgl19980528.html Preliminary Injunction ''ACLU v. Johnson''] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; the case was appealed by New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/15091prs19990920.html Appeal of ''ACLU v. Johnson''] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The appeals court upheld the ruling, so now this case is a federal precedent, supporting the freedom of speech on the Internet for all U.S. citizens.

'''June 1999''' - joined as a plaintiff in ''Cyberspace v. Engler'', with the ACLU, challenging Michigan's cyber-censorship law, citing the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]]'s [[Commerce Clause|commerce clause]] and free speech rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/privacy/speech/14940prs19990623.html ''Cyberspace v. Engler''] accessed on 13 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, again upholding the right of free speech on the Internet.

'''March 2002''' - in the article, ''Fahrenheit 451.2: Is Cyberspace Burning?'',&lt;ref name="Fahrenheit451.2"/&gt;
the Internet is shown to deserve the same high level of free speech protection afforded to books and other printed matter. Art.Net is shown as an example of why self-rating is burdensome, unwieldy, and costly for websites to implement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11241">The oldest undisputed examples of [[figurative art]] are known from [[Aurignacian|Europe]] and from [[Sulawesi]], Indonesia, dated about 35,000 years old ([[Art of the Upper Paleolithic]]).&lt;ref name=Aubert2014&gt;M. Aubert et al., "Pleistocene cave art from Sulawesi, Indonesia", ''Nature'' volume 514, pages 223–227 (09 October 2014).
"using uranium-series dating of coralloid speleothems directly associated with 12 human hand stencils and two figurative animal depictions from seven cave sites in the Maros karsts of Sulawesi, we show that rock art traditions on this Indonesian island are at least compatible in age with the oldest European art. The earliest dated image from Maros, with a minimum age of 39.9 kyr, is now the oldest known hand stencil in the world. In addition, a painting of a babirusa (‘pig-deer’) made at least 35.4 kyr ago is among the earliest dated figurative depictions worldwide, if not the earliest one. Among the implications, it can now be demonstrated that humans were producing rock art by ∼40 kyr ago at opposite ends of the Pleistocene Eurasian world."&lt;/ref&gt;
Together with [[Paleolithic religion|religion]] and other [[cultural universal]]s of contemporary human societies, the emergence of [[figurative art]] is a necessary attribute of full [[behavioral modernity]].

There are, however, some examples of non-figurative designs which somewhat predate the Upper Paleolithic, beginning about 70,000 years ago ([[Marine Isotope Stage 4|MIS 4]]).
These include the earliest of the [[Franco-Cantabrian region|Iberian cave paintings]], including a [[hand stencil]] at the [[Cave of Maltravieso]], a simple linear design, and red paint applied to [[speleothem]]s, dated to at least 64,000 years ago and as such attributable to [[Neanderthal]]s.&lt;ref name=Hoffmann2018&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D.

"we present dating results for three sites in Spain that show that cave art emerged in Iberia substantially earlier than previously thought. Uranium-thorium (U-Th) dates on carbonate crusts overlying paintings provide minimum
ages for a red linear motif in La Pasiega (Cantabria), a hand stencil in Maltravieso (Extremadura), and red-painted speleothems in Ardales (Andalucía). Collectively, these results show that cave art in Iberia is older than 64.8 thousand years (ka). This cave art is the earliest dated so far and predates, by at least 20 ka, the arrival of modern humans in Europe, which implies Neandertal authorship."&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Blombos Cave]] of [[South Africa]] yielded some stones with engraved grid or cross-hatch patterns, dated to some 70,000 years ago.

In September 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the earliest known drawing by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', which is estimated to be 73,000 years old, much earlier than the 43,000 years old artifacts understood to be the earliest known modern human drawings found previously.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180912" /&gt;

predating the previously oldest known art by at least 20,000 years.&lt;ref name=Hoffmann2018/&gt;

The [[Mask of La Roche-Cotard]] has also been argued as being evidence of Neanderthal figurative art, although in a period post-dating their [[Neanderthal Cro-Magnon interaction|contact with ''Homo sapiens'']]. The "[[Divje Babe flute]]" had controversially been claimed as a Neanderthal musical instrument; other archaeologists have claimed a Cro-Magnon origin of the artefact. A number of rival archaeologists maintain an alternative hypothesis that the perfectly circular, spaced,  and aligned holes were bite marks of carnivores. The main argument in support of their alternative hypothesis is fundamentally circular in its reasoning: that the artefact which appears to be a flute of Neanderthal origin cannot be a flute of Neanderthal origin because Neanderthals did not have music, according to them.

==Southern Africa==
In 2002 in [[Blombos cave]], situated in [[South Africa]], [[ochre]] stones were discovered engraved with grid or cross-hatch patterns, dated to some 70,000 years ago.
This suggested to some researchers that [[early Homo sapiens|early ''Homo sapiens'']] were capable of abstraction and production of abstract art or symbolic art. Also discovered at the  Blombos cave were shell beads, also dating to c. 70,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=" Watts 2009"&gt;Watts, Ian (2009) Red ochre, body painting, and language: interpreting the Blombos ochre.

==Claimed Lower Paleolithic art==
{{see|Makapansgat pebble}}
[[File:Museo de la Evolucion Humana Burgos - Tan Tan and Berekhat Ram Pebbles.jpg|thumb|150px|"[[Venus of Tan-Tan]]" (left) and "[[Venus of Berekhat Ram]]" (replicas)]]
Claims of artistic activity, in the form of diagonal etchings made with a sharks tooth, were made in 2014 relating to a 500,000-year-old fossil of a clam found in Java in the 1890s associated with ''[[Homo erectus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22429983.200-shell-art-made-300000-years-before-humans-evolved.html#.VISuEibfWnM&lt;/ref&gt;

''Homo erectus'' had long before produced seemingly aimless patterns on artifacts such as is those found at [[Bilzingsleben (Paleolithic site)|Bilzingsleben]] in [[Thuringia]]. Some have attempted to interpret these as a precursor to art, allegedly revealing the intent of the maker to decorate and fashion.  The symmetry and attention given to the shape of a tool has led authors to controversially argue [[Acheulean]] [[hand axe]]s as artistic expressions.

There are several other claims of Lower Paleolithic art, namely the  "[[Venus of Tan-Tan]]" (before 300 kya)&lt;ref name="Chase145"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Emergence of Culture: The Evolution of a Uniquely Human Way of Life|first=Philip G|last=Chase|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2005|ref=Chase|isbn=978-0-387-30512-7}}, pp. 145-146&lt;/ref&gt;  and the "[[Venus of Berekhat Ram]]" (250 kya). Both of these may be natural rock formations with an incidental likeness to the human form, but some scholars have suggested that they exhibit traces of pigments or carving intended to further accentuate the human-like form.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

{{Contains Tibetan text}}
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
The '''''Bardo Thodol''''' ({{bo|t=བར་དོ་ཐོས་གྲོལ|w=bar do thos grol}}, "Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State") is a text from a larger corpus of teachings, the ''Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones'',{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}}{{refn|group=note|''zab-chos zhi khro dgongs pa rang grol'', also known as ''kar-gling zhi-khro''{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=ix}}}} revealed by [[Karma Lingpa]] (1326–1386). It is the best-known work of [[Nyingma]] literature,{{sfn|Coleman|2005}} and is known in the West as the '''''Tibetan Book of the Dead'''''.

The Tibetan text describes, and is intended to guide one through, the experiences that the consciousness has after death, in the [[bardo]], the interval between death and the next [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]]. The text also includes chapters on the [[signs of death]] and rituals to undertake when death is closing in or has taken place.

==Etymology==
''Bar do thos grol'' ({{bo|t=བར་དོ་ཐོས་གྲོལ|w=bar do thos grol}}) translates as:

* ''bar do'': "[[bardo|intermediate state]]", "transitional state", "in-between state", "[[Liminality|liminal]] state" (which is synonymous with the [[Sanskrit]] ''antarabhāva''). Valdez: "Used loosely, the term "bardo" refers to the state of existence intermediate between two lives on earth."{{sfn|Valdez|2014|p=166, note 122}} Valdez: "[The] concept arose soon after the Buddha's passing, with a number of earlier Buddhist groups accepting the existence of such an intermediate state, while other schools rejected it."{{sfn|Valdez|2014|p=166, note 122}}
* ''thos grol'': "liberation", which is synonymous with the Sanskrit word ''[[bodhi]]'', "awakening", "understanding",  "enlightenment", and synonymous with the term ''nirvana'', "blowing out", "extinction", "the extinction of illusion".{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=21}}

==Original text==

===Origins and dating===
[[File:Zhi-Khro Bardo Thodol.jpg|thumb|265x265px|Centuries old [[Zhi-khro|Zhi-Khro]] [[mandala]], a part of the Bardo Thodol's collection, a text known in the West as The Tibetan Book of the Dead, which comprises part of a group of bardo teachings held in the [[Nyingma]] (Tibetan tradition) originated with [[guru]] [[Padmasambhava]] in the [[8th century|8th Century]].]]
According to Tibetan tradition, the ''Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State'' was composed in the 8th century by [[Padmasambhava]], written down by his primary student, [[Yeshe Tsogyal]], buried in the Gampo hills in central Tibet and subsequently discovered by a [[Tibet]]an [[terton]], [[Karma Lingpa]], in the 14th century.{{sfn|Evans-Wentz|1960|p=liv}}{{sfn|Fremantle|Fremantle|Trungpa|2003|p=xi}}{{sfn|Forbes|Henley|2013}}

===''bar do thos grol''===
The Tibetan title is ''bar do thos grol'',{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=xii}} ''Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State''.{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} It consists of two comparatively long texts:{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}}
* "Great Liberation through Hearing: The Supplication of the Bardo of Dharmata" (''chos nyid bar do'i gsol 'debs thos grol chen mo''), the bardo of dharmata (including the bardo of dying); 
* "Great Liberation through Hearing: The Supplication Pointing Out the Bardo of Existence" (''strid pa'i bar do ngo sprod gsol 'debs thos grol chen mo''), the bardo of existence. 
Within the texts themselves, the two combined are referred to as ''Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo'', ''Great Liberation through Hearing'', or just ''Liberation through Hearing''.{{refn|group=note|In Tibetan, ''bar do thos grol,'' ''thos grol chen mo'', and ''thos grol''}}

===''kar-gling zhi-khro''===
It is part of a larger terma cycle, ''Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation through the Intention of the Peaceful and Wrathful Ones'',{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} (''zab-chos zhi khro dgongs pa rang grol'', also known as ''kar-gling zhi-khro'',{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=ix}} popularly known as "Karma Lingpa's Peaceful and Wrathful Ones."{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}}

The ''Profound Dharma of Self-Liberation'' is known in several versions, containing varying numbers of sections and subsections, and arranged in different orders, ranging from around ten to thirty-eight titles.{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} The individual texts cover a wide range of subjects, including meditation instructions, visualizations of deities, liturgies and prayers, lists of mantras, descriptions of the signs of death, indications of future rebirth, and texts such as the ''bar do thos grol'' that are concerned with the bardo-state.{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}}

===Three bardos===
{{main|Bardo}}
The ''Bardo Thodol'' differentiates the intermediate state between lives into three bardos: 
# The ''chikhai bardo'' or "bardo of the moment of death", which features the experience of the [[Ösel (yoga)|"clear light of reality"]], or at least the nearest approximation of which one is spiritually capable;
# The ''chonyid bardo'' or "bardo of the experiencing of reality", which features the experience of [[Dzogchen#Tögal|visions]] of various [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] forms, or the nearest approximations of which one is capable;
# The ''sidpa bardo'' or "bardo of rebirth", which features karmically impelled hallucinations which eventually result in rebirth, typically [[Yab-Yum|yab-yum]] imagery of men and women passionately entwined.

The ''Liberation Through Hearing During the Intermediate State'' also mentions three other bardos:{{refn|group=note|See also [[Trikaya]], [[Kosha]] and [[Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta)]]}}
# "Life", or ordinary waking consciousness; 
# "Dhyana" (meditation); 
# "Dream", the dream state during normal sleep.

Together these "six bardos" form a classification of [[state of consciousness|states of consciousness]] into six broad types. Any state of consciousness can form a type of "intermediate state", intermediate between other states of consciousness. Indeed, one can consider any momentary state of consciousness a bardo, since it lies between our past and future existences; it provides us with the opportunity to experience reality, which is always present but obscured by the projections and confusions that are due to our previous unskillful actions.

===Evans-Wentz's ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead''===
[[File:Bardo. Vision des divinités sereines.jpg|thumb|371x371px|[[Thangka|Tibetan Thanka]] of Bardo. Vision of Serene [[Hindu deities|Deities]], [[19th century|19th Century]], [[Guimet Museum|Giumet Museum]]]]
The ''bar do thos grol'' is known in the west as ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'', a title popularized by [[Walter Evans-Wentz]]'s edition,{{sfn|Norbu|1989|p=xii}}{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71-115}} but as such virtually unknown in Tibet.{{sfn|Lopez|2011|p=127}}{{sfn|Fremantle|2001|p=20}} ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'' was first published in 1927 by [[Oxford University Press]]. Dr. Walter Y. Evans-Wentz chose this title because of the parallels he found with the [[Egyptian Book of the Dead]].{{sfn|Evans-Wentz|1960}}

According to John Myrdhin Reynolds, Evans-Wentz's edition of the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' introduced a number of misunderstandings about [[Dzogchen]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71}} In fact, Evans-Wentz' collected seven texts about visualization of the after-death experiences and he introduced this work collection as "The Tibetan Book of Death." Evans-Wentz was well acquainted with Theosophy and used this framework to interpret the translation of ''The Tibetan Book of the Dead'', which was largely provided by two Tibetan lamas who spoke English, Lama Sumdhon Paul and Lama Lobzang Mingnur Dorje.{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=72–73, 78}} Evans-Wentz was not familiar with Tibetan Buddhism,{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71}} and his view of Tibetan Buddhism was "fundamentally neither Tibetan nor Buddhist, but Theosophical and Vedantist."{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=78}} He introduced a terminology into the translation which was largely derived from Hinduism, as well as from his [[Theosophical Society|Theosophical beliefs]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1989|p=71}} Contrary to the general belief spread in the West by Evans-Wentz, in Tibetan Buddhist practice the Tibetan Book of Dead is not read to the people who are passing away, but it is rather used during life by those who want to learn to visualize what will come after death.&lt;ref&gt;Paul van der Velde&lt;/ref&gt;

C. G. Jung’s psychological commentary first appeared in an English translation by R. F. C. Hull in the third revised and expanded Evans-Wentz edition of The Tibetan Book of the Dead.{{sfn|Evans-Wentz ed.|1965}} The commentary also appears in the Collected Works.{{sfn|Jung|1977}} Jung applied his extensive knowledge of eastern religion to craft a commentary specifically aimed at a western audience unfamiliar with eastern religious tradition in general and Tibetan Buddhism specifically.{{sfn|Coward|1985|}} He does not attempt to directly correlate the content of the Bardo Thodol with rituals or dogma found in occidental religion, but rather highlights karmic phenomena described on the Bardo plane and shows how they parallel unconscious contents (both personal and collective) encountered in the west, particularly in the context of analytical psychology. Jung’s comments should be taken strictly within the realm of psychology, and not that of theology or metaphysics. Indeed, he warns repeatedly of the dangers for western man in the wholesale adoption of eastern religious traditions such as yoga.{{sfn|Coward|1985|p=79-92}}

===''The Psychedelic Experience''===
{{See also|Ego death}}

''[[The Psychedelic Experience]]'', published in 1964, is a guide for [[LSD|LSD-trips]], written by [[Timothy Leary]], [[Ralph Metzner]] and [[Richard Alpert]], loosely based on Evan-Wentz's translation of the ''[[Tibetan Book of the Dead]]''.{{sfn|Merkur|2014|p=221}}{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218}} [[Aldous Huxley]] introduced the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' to Timothy Leary.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218}} According to Leary, Metzner and Alpert, the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'' is 
{{quote|... a key to the innermost recesses of the human mind, and a guide for initiates, and for those who are seeking the spiritual path of liberation.{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Alpert|1964|p=11}}}}

They construed the effect of LSD as a "stripping away" of ego-defenses, finding parallels between the stages of death and rebirth in the ''Tibetan Book of the Dead'', and the stages of psychological "death" and "rebirth" which Leary had identified during his research.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=218-219}} 
According to Leary, Metzner and Albert it is:
{{quote|... one of the oldest and most universal practices for the initiate to go through the experience of death before he can be spiritually reborn. Symbolically he must die to his past, and to his old ego, before he can take his place in the new spiritual life into which he has been initiated.{{sfn|Leary|Metzner|Albert|1964|p=12}}}}

'''''Becoming Jane Austen''''' was researched and written by the Jane Austen scholar [[Jon Hunter Spence]]. It chronicles a demi-biographical version of Austen's early biography based on Spence's interpretation of the novel ''Pride and Prejudice'' as possibly being modeled on Austen's real life, although Austen herself does not make this claim for her novel.

''Becoming Jane Austen'' was first published in hardcover by [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Hambledon Continuum]] in 2003.  It chronicles the early life of [[Jane Austen]], the encounters and the developing relationship between Austen and [[Tom Lefroy]], based on letters sent by Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra.  The book was used as the basis for the film ''[[Becoming Jane]]'', which was released in January 2007 (Sydney). Jon Spence was a historical consultant for the film.

A review of the book by the Jane Austen Society of North America states that, "Jon Spence’s ''Becoming Jane Austen'' is one of the best half-dozen books published on Austen in the last quarter century, at least. It is a remarkably learned book written in a remarkably lucid style and a joy to read. The research is so substantial, wide-ranging, and detailed that any conjecture Spence builds on it has the feel of bedrock itself. His interpretation of Jane Austen’s character and personality as well as of her fiction impresses the reader with his long and intimate acquaintance with the writer and her works."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jasna.org/bookrev/br193p23.html |title=Spence, Becoming Jane Austen |publisher=Jasna.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A paperback edition of the book was published by Continuum on 14 June 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1847250467/ |title=Becoming Jane Austen (9781847250469): Jon Spence: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austen-Lefroy relationship was also used as the basis for ''Jane and Tom: The Real Pride and Prejudice'', a radio play by Elizabeth Lewis.  It was first broadcast on 1 June 2007, starring [[Jasmine Hyde]] as Austen and [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]] as Lefroy, along with [[Penny Downie]] as Mrs Austen, [[Jane Whittenshaw]] as Mrs Lefroy, Rachel Atkins as [[Anne Lefroy]], Lynne Seamore as [[Cassandra Austen]], [[Keiron Self]] as [[John Warren (Austen family friend)|John Warren]], and Manon Edwards as Ellen, and directed by Celia De Wolff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007llmb |title=BBC Radio 4 - Afternoon Drama, Jane and Tom: The Real Pride and Prejudice |publisher=BBC |date=1 June 2007|accessdate=2013-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4045">'''Charles Sears Baldwin''' (21 March 1867 – 23 October 1935) was an American scholar and professor of rhetoric at [[Yale University]].

==Biography==
Born in [[New York City]] in 1867, Baldwin entered Columbia College at seventeen and received his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;Haller, William (1935). "Charles Sears Baldwin," ''Columbia University Quarterly'' '''27''', pp. 427–429.&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the earliest students to be granted the Ph.D. degree in English at Columbia.&lt;ref&gt;Hoehn, Matthew (1948). "Charles Sears Baldwin, 1867–1935." In: ''Catholic Authors: Contemporary Biographical Sketches''. Newark, N.J.: St. Mary's Abbey, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides teaching at Yale (1895–1911), Baldwin also worked at [[Barnard College]]&lt;ref&gt;Djwa, Sandra (1991). ''Giving Canada a Literary History: A Memoir by Carl F. Klinck''. McGill-Queen's Press, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Columbia University]]. He was married twice, first in 1894 to Agnes Irwin (who died in 1897), and then to Gratia Eaton Whited in 1902. Most of his life an Episcopalian, he converted to [[Catholicism]] the year before his death.&lt;ref&gt;Hoehn (1948), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Baldwin died in [[New York City]] in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&amp;d=cs19351024-01.2.11 "Baldwin Dead; Won Fame Here As Rhetorician,"] ''Columbia Daily Spectator'', Vol. LIX, No. 21, 24 October 1935, pp. 1, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''coat of arms of [[Puerto Rico]]''' was first granted by the [[Spanish monarchy|Spanish Crown]] in 1511, making it the oldest heraldic achievement still currently in use in the Americas.&lt;ref name="New York Daily News, June 3, 2008"&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/2008/06/04/2008-06-04_have_a_puerto_rican_question_ask_el_bori.html?page=1 ''New York Daily News'', June 3, 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;  The territory was ceded by Spain to the United States in accordance to the peace treaty that ended the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1899, after which two interim arms were adopted briefly. A law was passed in 1905 that re-established the historical armorial bearings as the arms of the territory; after numerous investigations and amendments, the current version was adopted in 1976.

==History==
[[File:Columbus Taking Possession.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Christopher Columbus]] arriving in the [[New World]] carrying a banner with the initials of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]] and [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella I]].]]
The major symbolism of the coat of arms relates to the dominance of Spain, the strong Roman Catholic influence in the region, and the integrity of Puerto Rico as a colony of Spain. There have been different variations of the coat of arms changing throughout Puerto Rico's history. The current version was officially re-adopted by the Commonwealth government of [[Puerto Rico]] on 3 June 1976.

On the shield:
* The green background represents the island's vegetation. The [[Lamb of God]] and cross flag on the shield are symbols traditionally associated with [[St. John the Baptist]], patron of the island. The book with the seven seals on which the lamb sits represents symbolism from the [[Book of Revelation]], generally attributed to [[St. John the Apostle]].
* The border is made up of 16 different elements: castles and lions to represent the [[Kingdom of Castile]] and the [[Kingdom of León]], a flag with the arms of the [[Crown of Castile]] and León, and The Cross of [[Jerusalem]] to stand for the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], whose succession rights passed to the [[Kingdom of Sicily]], and henceforth to the [[Spanish Crown]].
* The gold-crowned '''''[[F]]''''' and the [[arrow]]s ({{lang-es|flechas}}) represent [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|'''F'''erdinand II of Aragon]], while the '''''[[Y]]''''' and the [[yoke]] ({{lang-es|yugo}}) represent Ysabel, i.e., [[Isabella I of Castile|'''I'''sabella I of Castile]] who were the [[Catholic monarchs]] when Puerto Rico was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;  [http://www.gobierno.pr/GPRPortal/Inicio/PuertoRico/Simbolo] s/Escudo.htm Official Puerto Ricao Government website.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is said, that the "I" on the shield, was in fact a "J" representing Queen "Joanna", commonly known as "Juana La Loca", daughter, and successor of Queen Isabella after she allegedly became mentally ill after the death of her husband, and in whose name her father, as regent of Spain granted the coat of arms to the Spanish territory of San Juan, as Puerto Rico was then known.
* The [[Latin]] motto, "JOANNES EST NOMEN EJUS" (a quotation from the [[Vulgate]] of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:63), means "John is his name", referring to [[St. John the Baptist]] or San Juan Bautista, the original name of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Grabowski, John F. (1992). ''U.S. Territories and Possessions (State Report Series)''. Chelsea House Pub. Page 7. {{ISBN|9780791010532}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Seal==
All of the states and territories of the United States employ a seal to authenticate and ratify documents and accordingly a seal of Puerto Rico exists, but the traditional coat of arms is used as the main emblem of the commonwealth. The seal has most of the elements of the coat of arms, but the religious elements have been stripped away in accordance with the [[Separation of church and state in the United States]]. In the seal, the lamb, which no longer has a halo, carries a white banner instead of one with a red cross. The lamb's staff does not have the cross mounted on top. The book the lamb sits on does not have the seals of the Book of Revelation. The first Governors used the seal as their emblem but in recent years the usage of the seal has been limited to being the official emblem used to represent Puerto Rico on its legal documents when they are sealed.

==Seal of the Governor==
The Seal of the [[Governor of Puerto Rico|Governor]] is the official symbol of the executive head of Puerto Rico. It follows the design used by the [[Seal of the President of the United States]]. There are several variants of the Governor's Seal in use.

[[Image:Conté crayons.JPG|thumb|Conté crayons]]
[[Image:Rashomon-sketch.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a drawing of a face and two hands|Page from a [[sketchbook]] using black Conté crayon.]]
'''Conté''', also known as '''Conté sticks''' or '''Conté crayons''', are a drawing medium composed of compressed powdered [[graphite]] or [[charcoal]] mixed with a [[wax]] or [[clay]] base, square in cross-section. They were invented in 1795 by [[Nicolas-Jacques Conté]], who created the combination of clay and graphite in response to the shortage of graphite caused by the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (the [[United Kingdom|British]] naval blockade of [[France]] prevented [[import]]). Conté crayons had the advantage of being [[cost-effective]] to produce, and easy to manufacture in controlled grades of [[hardness]].

They are now manufactured using natural [[pigment]]s ([[iron oxide]]s, [[carbon black]], [[titanium dioxide]]), [[clay]] ([[kaolin]]), and a [[binder (material)|binder]] ([[cellulose]] [[ether]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Conte à Paris |url=http://www.lefranc-bourgeois.com/catalogue_va/index.php?gam_cle=57&amp;s_gam_cle=105 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809184709/http://www.lefranc-bourgeois.com/catalogue_va/index.php?gam_cle=57&amp;s_gam_cle=105 |archivedate = 2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conté crayons are most commonly found in black, white, and [[sanguine]] tones, as well as [[bistre]], shades of [[grey]], and other colors. Currently in the USA, sets of 12 assorted portrait and landscape colors are available as well as a sketching set, plus sets of 18, 24 or 48 colors. In Europe, 22 more colors are available and the colors other than sanguine, bistre, grey, black, and white are available open stock.

Colors sets are especially useful for field studies and color studies. Some artists create entire paintings with them, using them more like pastels than like a drawing medium. They are also used often to sketch under pastel paintings or lay down initial layers before using dry pastels. The colors sets lean toward very bright spectrum hues that mix well; even the 12 assorted color set can be layered to produce any hues or values desired. Color Conté mixes better on paper than many hard pastel products.

They are frequently used on rough paper that holds pigment grains well. They can also be used on prepared primed [[canvas]]es for [[underdrawing]] for a painting. The sticks' square profile make Conté crayons more suitable for detailed hatched work as opposed to the bolder [[painterly]] drawing style demanded by soft [[pastel]]s.

== Georges Seurat ==
In the 1880s, [[Georges Seurat]] used Conté crayons to produce many of his studies.

'''''Flora Graeca''''' was a publication of the plants of [[Greece]] in the late 18th century, resulting from a survey by [[John Sibthorp]] and [[Ferdinand Bauer]].  The botanical descriptions and illustrations were to become highly valued by the English audience; the finely crafted and illustrated work was of both scientific and horticultural interest.

Sibthorp met the [[botanical illustrator]] Bauer in Vienna, where he had made a voyage to study a copy of [[Dioscorides]]' early botanical work, the renowned [[Vienna Dioscurides]]. This was the first part of a journey, to identify medicinal plants used in Greece;  Bauer was to join the expedition as the illustrator. They were to record and collect a large number of novel specimens; their publication introduced these to an English audience. From March 1786 to December 1787 they surveyed the plants and animals of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], Sibthorp collecting and describing, Bauer making dried specimens and producing colour-coded sketches.  Bauer's work, including around a thousand intricate and annotated sketches, is now regarded as one of the finest examples of [[botanical illustration]].

Sibthorp's volumes were to become a botanical publication, the original intention to produce a [[herbal]] or medical volume was transformed into a scientific survey.  An accompanying volume, ''Fauna Graeca'', and other planned works on the region, was not realised.

Sibthorp assembled the descriptions and [[Lithography|plates]], at his death in 1796 his will included an endowment to see the book published.  The task of preparing the works was undertaken by [[James Edward Smith]], who issued the two volumes of the '''''Prodromus''''' in 1806 and 1813, and six volumes as '''''Flora Graeca Sibthorpiana''''' between 1806 and 1828. The seventh appeared in 1830, after Smith's death, and the remaining three were produced by [[John Lindley]] between 1833 and 1840.
E
Each volume contained a hundred plates, except the last, and these were engraved by [[James Sowerby]]. Only 30 copies of this set were issued, another 50 complete sets were reissued in 1845 by [[Henry George Bohn]]. The cost in 1830 was 620 pounds.  The scarcity of the early first editions led to doubt of their existence, the rare book is at the higher end of trade.  The inherent value has led the [[Bodleian Libraries]] to make available a digital scan of the complete set.

The publication was issued with tables and indices of the scientific name, the common name in Greek was in this concordance.
It was during a period of increasing interest in horticulture and highly desired exotic species were described, many would become perennials of the English [[flower garden]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31354">The '''French Restoration style''' was predominantly [[French Neoclassicism|Neoclassicism]], though it also showed the beginnings of [[romanticism]] in music and literature. The term describes the arts, architecture, and decorative arts of the [[Bourbon Restoration]] period (1814–1830), during the reign of [[Louis XVIII]] and [[Charles X of France|Charles X]]  from the fall of [[Napoleon]] to the [[July Revolution]] of 1830 and the beginning of the reign of [[Louis-Philippe]].

==Architecture and design==

===Public buildings and monuments===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
To commemorate the memory of [[Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]] and to expiate the crime of their execution,  King Louis XVIII built the [[Chapelle expiatoire]] by [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]] on the site of the small cemetery of the Madeleine, where their remains (now in the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]]) had been hastily buried following their execution. It was completed and dedicated in 1826.

The royal government restored the symbols of the old regime, but continued the construction of most of the monuments and urban projects begun by Napoleon. The church of [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]], begun under Louis XVI, had been turned by Napoleon into the Temple of Glory (1807).  It was now turned back to its original purpose, as the Royal church of [[La Madeleine, Paris|La Madeleine]]. All of the public buildings and churches of the Restoration were built in a relentlessly [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style.  Work resumed, slowly, on the unfinished [[Arc de Triomphe]], begun by Napoleon.  At the end of the reign of Louis XVIII,  the government decided to transform it from a monument to the victories of Napoleon into a monument celebrating the victory of the Duke of Angôuleme over the Spanish revolutionaries who had overthrown their Bourbon king. A new inscription was planned: "To the Army of the Pyrenees"  but the inscription had not been carved and the work was still not finished when the regime was toppled in 1830. {{sfn|Héron de Villefosse|1958|page=313}}

The [[Canal Saint-Martin]] was finished in 1822, and the building of the [[Bourse de Paris]], or stock market, designed and begun by [[Alexandre-Théodore Brongniart]] from 1808 to 1813, was modified and completed by [[Éloi Labarre]] in 1826. New storehouses for grain near the Arsenal, new slaughterhouses, and new markets were finished. Three new suspension bridges were built over the Seine;  the Pont d'Archeveché,  the Pont des Invalides and footbridge of the Grève.  All three were rebuilt later in the century.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Several new churches were begun during the Restoration to replace those destroyed during the Revolution. A battle took place between architects who wanted a neogothic style, modeled after Notre-Dame, or the neoclassical style, modeled after the basilicas of ancient Rome. The battle was won by a majority of neoclassicists on the Commission of Public Buildings, who dominated until 1850. [[Jean Chalgrin]] had designed Saint-Philippe de Role before the Revolution in a neoclassical style; it was completed (1823–30) by [[Étienne-Hippolyte Godde]]. Godde also completed Chalgrin's project for Saint-Pierre-du-Gros-Caillou {1822–29), and built the neoclassic basilicas of Notre-Dame-du-Bonne Nouvelle ((1823–30) and Saint-Denys-du-Saint-Sacrament (1826–35). {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=84–85}}  Other notable neoclassical architects of the Restoration included [[Louis-Hippolyte Lebas]], who built [[Notre-Dame-de-Lorette, Paris|Notre-Dame-de-Lorette]] (1823–36); (1823–30); and [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]], who built the church of [[Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Paris|Church of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul]] (1824–44). Hittorff went on to along a brilliant career in the reigns of Louis Philippe and Napoleon III, designing the new plan of the Place de la Concorde and constructing the [[Gare du Nord]] railway station (1861–66). {{sfn|Sarmant|2012|page163}}

===Commercial architecture - the shopping gallery===
[[File:Galerie of the Palais Royal - interior, 1831.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Galerie d'Orleans at the [[Palais-Royal]] (1818–29), a shopping arcade covered with a glass roof, by [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]]]]
A new form of commercial architecture had appeared at the end of the 18th century; the passage, or shopping gallery, a row of shops along a narrow street covered by a glass roof. They were made possible by improved technologies of glass and cast iron, and were popular since few Paris streets had sidewalks and pedestrians had to compete with wagons, carts, animals and crowds of people.  The first indoor shopping gallery in Paris had opened at the [[Palais-Royal]] in 1786;  rows of shops, along with cafes and the first restaurants,  were located under the arcade around the garden.  It was followed by the passage Feydau in 1790–91,  the passage du Caire in 1799, and the [[Passage des Panoramas]] in 1800.{{sfn|Fierro|2003|page=36}}   In 1834 the architect [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]] carried the idea a step further, covering an entire courtyard of the Palais-Royal, the Galerie d'Orleans, with a glass skylight. The gallery remained covered until 1935.  It was the ancestor of the glass skylights of the Paris department stores of the later 19th century. {{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=70–71}}

===Residential architecture===
[[File:Square d'Orléans.jpg|thumb|right|200px|English neoclassical house in the [[Square d'Orleans]] (1829–35) by [[Edward Cresy]]]] 
During the Restoration, and particularly after the coronation of King [[Charles X]] in 1824. New residential neighborhoods were built on the Right Bank in Paris, as the city grew to the north and west. Between 1824 and 1826, a time of economic prosperity, the quarters of Saint-Vincent-de-Paul, Europe, Beaugrenelle and Passy were all laid out and construction began.  The width of lots grew larger; from six to eight meters wide for a single house to between twelve and twenty meters for a residential building. The typical new residential building was four to five stories high, with an attic roof sloping forty-five degrees, broken by five to seven windows. The decoration was largely adapted from that of the Rue de Rivoli;  horizontal rather than vertical orders, and simpler decoration. The windows were larger and occupied a larger portion of the façades. Decoration was provided by ornamental iron shutters and then wrought-iron balconies. Variations of this model were the standard on Paris boulevards until the Second Empire.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=74–75}}

The hôtel particular, or large private house of the Restoration, usually was built in a neoclassical style, based on Greek architecture or the style of [[Palladio]], particularly in the new residential quarters of Nouvelle Athenes and the Square d'Orleans on Rue Taibout (9th arrondissement), a private residential square (1829–35) in the English neoclassical style designed by Edward Cresy. Residents of the square included [[George Sand]] and [[Frédéric Chopin]]. Some of the houses in the new quarters in the 8th arrondissement, particularly the quarter of François I, begun in 1822,  were made in a more picturesque style, a combination of the Renaissance and classical style, called the ''Troubadour'' style. This marked the beginning of the movement away from uniform neoclassicism toward eclectic residential architecture.{{Sfn|Texier|2012|pages=74–75}}

===Interior Design and Furniture===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The decorative style of the French Restoration borrowed from both the geometry of the neoclassical style era, and the overload of decoration of the Louis XIV style, along with the color of Renaissance. One of the best examples is the Charles X museum within the Louvre, a suite of rooms that was created for, among other purposes, the Salon of artists that was held there annually. The ceilings were divided into compartments filled with paintings and lavishly decorated with corniches, columns and pilasters. The neo-Gothic also began to appear in interior decoration during the 1820, particularly in the design of galleries and salons with arches and arched windows and rose windows modeled after those in gothic cathedrals.  Another feature of the French restoration was polychromy, the use of bright colors in the decorations, either with colored stone, glass, or paintings. Ceilings were particularly lavish, with hemicycles, cupolas, pendants, and vaults, often filled with decorative paintings. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=182}}

Another good example of the French Restoration style of design is the interior of the [[Chapelle expiatoire]]. While the layout of the building and architecture is sober and perfectly Greco-Roman neoclassicism, the inside of the dome is decorated with rosettes, and there is an abundance of high-relief sculpted decoration in bands below the cornices and between the columns supporting the dome, including stylized Maltese crosses, fleur-de-lis and roses. The floor also has elaborate polychrome decoration in stone with the same motifs. {{Sfn|Ducher|1988|page=186}}

With the downfall of Napoleon, those aristocrats who had fled France during the Revolution began to return; they found their furniture had largely been confiscated and sold during the Revolution, and they had little money to buy lavish new furniture. The new King, Louis XVIII, liked the Empire style, so that style remained in place, with slightly rounded lines, and the removal of the Napoleonic symbols and ornaments,&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'', pg. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Louis XVIII in 1824, the new King, his brother Charles X, allotted an indemnity to aristocrats whose belongings had been confiscated during the Revolution, and the luxury furniture industry began to revive. Interest began to develop in older styles, particularly Gothic and Renaissance, especially after the creation of a museum of French monuments during the Revolution, but the gothic revival movement did not become really strong until after the publication in 1831 of ''[[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]'' by [[Victor Hugo]] (1831).&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, ''Les Styles de l'architecture et du mobilier'', pg. 96-97&lt;/ref&gt;

Ornament of gilded bronze became rarer;  most ornament was marquetry inlay, either light wood into dark, or dark wood into light;  often in form of very elaborate floral designs, under the influence of the Duchesse de Berry. Under Charles X, the ''á la Cathédral'' or Cathedral chair became popular, with a back resembling the form of a Gothic stained glass window.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, (2006) pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt; The Gothic rose also became a popular decoration on furniture, along with stylized palmettes and other floral designs. Comfort was another consideration in the design of new chairs. The Voltaire armchair, with sabre-curved front legs, a high curving padded back and padded armrests, became popular.&lt;ref&gt;Renault and Lazé, (2006) pg. 98&lt;/ref&gt; It took its name from a popular illustration of portrait of Voltaire, made about 1820, which showed him seated in s similar armchair.&lt;ref&gt;Storck, Justin, ''Le Dictionnaire pratique de menuiserie, ébénisterie, charpente,''&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Restoration saw the beginning of the long battle between neoclassicism and romanticism in painting and other domains of art. [[Jacques-Louis David]], the dominant neoclassical painter during the reign of Napoleon, went into exile in Belgium;  however, other prominent students of David remained in Paris, and continued the style, simply changing the subject matter.  They included [[François Gérard]], who painted the coronation of King [[Charles X]] in 1827, following almost exactly the composition used by David in his coronation painting of the Emperor Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;Toman, ''Neoclassicism et Romanticism'' (2007), page 377&lt;/ref&gt;  Other former pupils of David included [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] (1771-1835), and the most prominent of all, [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], (1780-1867), who painted his famous ''Grand Odalisque'' in the year that Napoleon first went into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Toman, ''Neoclassicism et Romanticism'' (2007), page 377&lt;/ref&gt;

The new generation of neoclassicists, led by Ingres and Gérard, largely ignored the idea of a classicism based on Ancient Roman and Greek values, and concentrated instead on the perfection of the depiction of human body, by its lines, composition and color.&lt;ref&gt;Toman, ''Neoclassicism et Romanticism'' (2007), page 382&lt;/ref&gt; During the Restoration, Ingres was commissioned to paint a mural for the ceiling of the Salle Clarac of the [[Louvre]], called ''Apothéose de Homer''.  Completed in 1827, it brought together all of the famous artists of history, attending the crowning of Homer by an angel.  Ingres also surpassed all of his contemporaries of the period as a portrait painter. In 1819 Ingres painted ''Roger rescuing Angelique'', inspired by St. George slaying a dragon, in an almost surrealistic setting.  Here Ingres' style foreshadowed the drama of [[Gustave Moreau]] Other painters who often followed the more delicate and sensual version of neoclassicism included [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]] (1758–1821), and the portraitist [[Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]].&lt;ref&gt;Toman, (2007), page 390–96&lt;/ref&gt;

An entirely different approach to painting was taken by [[Théodore Géricault|Jean Louis Théodore Géricault]]  with his painting ''The Raft of the Meduse'' (1818–1819), depicting the true story of the survivors of a shipwreck, gathered on a raft, appealing for help to a far distant ship. Géricault had meticulously studied anatomy to make the dead bodies on the raft more realistic. The painting was bitterly attacked by many critics and defended by many others, including the poet [[Baudelaire]] and the painter [[Horace Vernet]]. Géricault returned to the theme in 1821-24, with "The Tempest" or "The shipwreck" a painting of a corpse washed ashore on beach during storm. (1821–24), illustrating graphically again how humans were powerless against nature. In 1822–23, Gericault painted ''La Folle'', a portrait of a madwoman in a Paris asylum with a distant, hopeless stare. His school of painting became known a "theatrical romanticism".&lt;ref&gt;Toman, (2007), page 411-412&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugène Delacroix]] was another major painter of "theatrical romanticism" who emerged during the Restoration.  As a young painter, he was particularly impressed by the works of [[Rubens]] in the Louvre, by the drawings of [[Goya]], and the paintings of [[John Constable|Constable]].  After traveling to England, where he met Constable, he returned to Paris and became friends with [[Stendhal]], [[Balzac]] and [[Victor Hugo]]. At the Paris Salon of 1827, he showed nine paintings.  The following year, he presented ''The Death of Sardanapale''.  In the fall of 1830, shortly after the [[July Revolution]], which toppled King Charles X, he painted  ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'', which was presented at the 1831 Salon, and became one of the icons of French art.&lt;ref&gt;Toman, (2007), page 408-409&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The most prominent French sculptor of the Restoration was [[François Joseph Bosio]] (1768-1845).  Born in [[Monaco]], he received a scholarship from the Prince of Monaco to study in Paris, under [[Augustin Pajou]].  During the Empire of Napoleon, he sculpted some of the plaques on the column in [[Place Vendôme]], and made numerous portrait busts of the Emperor's family.  During the restoration, he became the royal sculptor to the King, and made both portrait busts and sculptors in the classical-romantic style.  He made the central statue Louis XVI for the Expiatory Chapel, called ''Apotheosis of Louis XVI'' or ''Louis XVI called to immortality, supported by an angel''. In 1828 he completed a new work of sculpture for the top of the [[Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel]] at the Louvre.  A chariot and horse sculpture, taken by Napoleon from [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice, had originally been placed atop the arch, but it had been returned to Venice after Napoleon's downfall.  The Bourbons commissioned Bosio to make a new work, Peace guiding a Chariot, to commemorate the Bourbon Restoration. Bosio was also commissioned to replace the equestrian statue of Louis XIV which had been the centerpiece of [[Place des Victoires]], which had been destroyed during the Revolution. His new version, twelve meters high, was installed in 1828.

Another notable French sculptor of the period was Pierre Jean David 1788–1856), who called himself [[David d'Angers]], to distinguish himself from his teacher, Jacques Louis David. He worked in the studio of Jacques Louis David beginning in 1809. Then, between 1811 and 1816 he studied at the French Academy in Rome, where he became familiar with the works of [[Canova]], the great Italian master of romanticism. However, he turned his own work toward classicism, illustrating the patriotic and moral virtues. He made busts or statues of many notable statesmen, including the [[Marquis de Lafayette]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Goethe]].  In 1830, he began working on his best-known work, the frieze over the entrance of the [[Panthéon|Pantheon]], titled ''The Country recognizes its great men'', which he completed in 1837. {{Sfn|Toman|2007|page=298}}

Another notable sculptor who began his career during the Restoration was [[François Rude]], (1784–1847), He moved to Paris from Dijon in 1805 to study with [[Pierre Cartellier]]. In 1811 he won the [[Prix de Rome]], but he was a confirmed Bonapartist, and after the downfall of Napoleon, he went into exile in Beligium, where he had success as a portrait sculptor. He did not return until 1827. Between 1833 and 1836, he made the celebrated sculptures, called ''Les Marseillaise'', which decorate the [[Arc de Triomphe]].

==Literature and theater==

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The Bourbon restoration saw the rise of [[romanticism]] to the position of the dominant movement in French literature. The earliest prominent romantic was [[François-René de Chateaubriand]], an essayist and diplomat. He began the Restoration as a committed defender of the Catholic faith and royalist, but gradually moved into the liberal opposition and became a fervent supporter of freedom of speech.  Other prominent romantic writers of the period included the poet and politician [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], [[Gérard de Nerval]], [[Alfred de Musset]], [[Théophile Gautier]], and [[Prosper Mérimée]].&lt;ref&gt;''Petit Larousse de l'histoire de France'' (2004), pages 361-364&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite limitations on press freedom, Paris editors published the first works of some of France's most famous writers. [[Honoré de Balzac]] moved to Paris in 1814, studied at the University of Paris, wrote his first play in 1820, and published his first novel, ''Les Chouans'', in 1829. [[Alexandre Dumas]] moved to Paris in 1822, and found a position working for the future King, Louis-Philippe, at the Palais-Royal. In 1829, At the age of 27, he published his first play, ''Henri III and his Courts''. [[Stendhal]], a pioneer of literary realism, published his first novel, ''[[The Red and the Black]]'', in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;''Petit Larousse de l'histoire de France'' (2004), pages 361-364&lt;/ref&gt;

The young [[Victor Hugo]] declared that he wanted to be "Chateaubriand or nothing". His first book of poems, published in 1822 when he was twenty years old, earned him a royal prize from Louis XVIII. His second book of poems in 1826 established him as one of France's leading poets. He wrote his first plays, ''Cromwell'' and ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'' in 1827 and 1830, and his first short novel, ''The Last Days of a Condemned Man'', in 1829. The premiere of the ultra-romantic play ''Hernani'' caused a riot in the audience, on the eve of the fall of the Bourbon Monarchy,&lt;ref&gt;''Petit Larousse de l'histoire de France'' (2004), pages 361-364&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
The restoration of the monarchy with the coronation of Louis XVIII brought an end to the era of gigantic outdoor celebrations with patriotic music of the Revolution and the Empire of Napoleon. Instead, music returned to the salons of the old aristocracy, who returned from exile, and the new aristocracy created under Napoleon Bonaparte. The Music Conservatory in Paris was renamed the Royal School of Music, and the King commissioned the Italian-born [[Luigi Cherubini]], newly named music director of the chapel of the Tuileries Palace, to write a requiem mass for Louis XVI, as well as a coronation mass for himself. The composer [[Gaspare Spontini]] was named director of royal music. A royal institution of religious music was also established in 1825, to perform early masterpieces of French religious music by [[Clément Janequin]]  and [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], which had been banned during the Revolution and ignored under Napoleon I.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|page=126}}

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The composers most performed in the part of the period were the work of composers of the pre-revolutionary period, [[Gluck]], [[Sacchini]] and [[Spontini]], but new composers soon appeared, including [[Carl Maria von Weber]], who arrived from Germany, and staged a highly-successful French version of the first romantic German opera,  ''[[Der Freischütz]]'', or ''The Marksman'',  in 1824.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|page=126}}

The most successful musical theater of the period was the [[Théâtre-Italien]], which performed in the Salle Favert in Paris; it produced the a series of operas by the most famous composer of the period, [[Gioachino Rossini]], including ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' in 1819.  Rossini moved to Paris in 1824, and was named Director of Music and Staging at the Théâtre-Italien.  Only Italian works were presented, always in Italian.  Rossini became the most prominent figure of the Paris musical world, writing the music for the coronation of Charles X in 1824.

In 1820 a Bonapartist assassinated the Duke du Berry at the Paris opera house on rue de Richelieu. King Louis XVIII ordered the immediate closing, and then the demolition, of the Opera House. The Opera moved to the [[Salle Le Peletier]], where it remained for fifty years. This theater was the scene of the birth of the first French grand opera, and the first romantic opera, with the premier of ''La Muette de Portici'' by [[Daniel Auber|Auber]] in July 1829. The theme of this opera, the rebellion of the people of Naples against Spanish rule, was particularly romantic and revolutionary.  A performance of the opera in Brussels in 1830 led to riots, followed by a real revolution. [[Wagner]] attended a performance and wrote, "it was something entirely new; no one had seen a subject of an opera so current;  it was the first true musical drama in five acts entirely provided with all the elements of tragedy, and notable also for its tragic ending."{{Sfn|Vila|2007|page=126}}

The Paris opera continued to astonish its audiences with new musical and visual effects. For the opera ''The Last Days of Pompeii'' by [[Giovanni Pacini]], the opera employed the scientist and inventor [[Louis Daguerre]] to create optical illusions on a screen simulating dancing flames and the waves of the sea.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|page=126}}

To satisfy the demands of Paris opera-goers for truly grand opera, Rossini was commissioned to write the [[Le siège de Corinthe]] and then ''[[William Tell (opera)|William Tell]]''.  This last work, which premiered at the Pelletier opera house on August 3, 1829, despite its famed overture, disappointed the critics, who criticized its excessive length, weak story, and lack of action.  The criticism stung Rossini, and, at the age of thirty-seven, he retired from writing operas.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|page=133}}

The musical salons of the aristocracy had a working-class counterpart in Paris during the Restoration;  the ''[[goguette]]'', musical clubs formed by Paris workers, craftsmen, and employees. There were ''goguettes'' of both men and women.  They usually met once a week, often in the back room of a cabaret, where they would enthusiastically sing popular, comic, and sentimental songs. During the Restoration, songs were also an important form of political expression. The poet and songwriter [[Pierre-Jean de Béranger]] became famous for his songs ridiculing the aristocracy, the established church and the ultra-conservative parliament. He was imprisoned twice for his songs, in 1821 and 1828, which only added to his fame. His supporters around France sent ''[[foie gras]]'', fine cheeses and wines to him in prison. The celebrated Paris police chief [[Eugène François Vidocq]] sent his men to infiltrate the ''goguettes'' and arrest those who sang songs ridiculing the monarch.{{Sfn|Vila|2007|page=128}}

The '''Glauberg''' is a [[Celts|Celtic]] [[oppidum]] in [[Hesse]], [[Germany]] consisting of a fortified settlement and several burial mounds, "a princely seat&lt;ref&gt;Prestige goods diagnostic of an elite habitation have not been found; the common designation of the Glauberg as a "princely seat" is based on the contents of the tombs located in a walled sanctuary at the foot of the southern slope.&lt;/ref&gt; of the late [[Hallstatt culture | Hallstatt]] and early [[La Tène]] periods."&lt;ref&gt;R.K., in John T. Koch, ed., ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'', 2006, ''s.v.'' "Glauberg".&lt;/ref&gt; [[archaeology|Archaeological]] discoveries in the 1990s place the site among the most important early Celtic centres in [[Europe]]. It provides unprecedented evidence on Celtic burial, sculpture and monumental architecture.

==Location and topography==
Geologically, the Glauberg, a ridge (271 m asl) on the east edge of the [[Wetterau]] plain, is a [[basalt]] spur of the [[Vogelsberg Mountains|Vogelsberg]] range. Rising about 150 m above the surrounding areas, it is located between the rivers [[Nidder]] and [[Seeme]] and belongs to the community of [[Glauburg]]. The hilltop forms a nearly horizontal plateau of 800 by 80–200m. Its southwest promontory is known as Enzheimer Köpfchen. To the northwest, the Glauberg slopes steeply down towards the Nidder valley and, in the south, it is connected with undulating uplands. The plateau contained a small perennial pond, which was not fed by springs but simply by surface runoff.&lt;ref&gt;The watertight strata  of clay that contained the pool were broken by demolition after World War II, and the pool drained. (Koch 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The hill is surrounded by springs and fertile land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keltenfuerst.de/index_1.htm];  [http://www.fuerstensitze.de/1118_Landschaftsarchaeologie_Glauberg.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of archaeological research==
[[File:Gold torque 2.jpg|left|thumb|Gold Celtic [[torc]] found in the larger tumulus at Glauberg, 400&amp;nbsp;BC]]

The presence of ancient ruins on the Glauberg plateau has long been known, though they were credited to the Romans. The discovery of a fragment of an early La Tène [[torc]] in 1906 confirmed the prehistoric nature of the site. Systematic archaeological research began in 1933–1934 with an [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] led by Heinrich Richter (1895–1970) which focused on the fortification.&lt;ref&gt;The findings and documentation were accidentally destroyed in the closing days of World War II (Koch 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies directed by F.-R. Hermann began in 1985 and continued until 1998. It was during this phase that the important burial mound was examined.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuerstensitze.de/1156_Projektbeschreibung.html www.fuerstensitze.de :: Landschaftsarchäologie Glauberg :: Projektbeschreibung&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The settlement history of the Glauberg and its area in Celtic times ([[Hallstatt culture|Hallstatt]] and early [[La Tène culture|La Tène]] periods) was the focus of a research project (2004–2006) by the '[[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fuerstensitze.de/1120_Fuerstensitz_Glauberg.html www.fuerstensitze.de :: Fürstensitz Glauberg&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Excavations continue into the present day with excavations planned from the 28th May till the 29th June with a multinational team excavating what that is believed to be a former massive rampart that is only visible through lidar at the present moment at the hillfort.

== Summary of settlement history ==
The topographic location marks the Glauberg as a long-term focus of human activity. It combines access to fertile arable land and water with an easily defensible site and a strategic location along several natural traffic routes. Thus, it is not surprising that the hill was the site of human occupation long before and long after its Celtic phase, well into the medieval period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keltenfuerst.de/index_1.htm ''Besiedelung&lt;/ref&gt;

The Glauberg plateau was first settled in the [[Neolithic]] era (c. 4500 BC) by people of the [[Rössen culture]]. This was followed by a large settlement of the [[Michelsberg culture|Michelsberg]] phase (4000 BC). Michelsberg hilltop fortifications are known elsewhere, so it is possible that the hill was fortified for the first time at that stage. The hill was also settled by the late [[Bronze Age]] [[Urnfield culture]] (1,000–800 BC). During the [[Celts|Celtic]] late [[Hallstatt]]/early [[La Tène]] period, the Glauberg became a centre of supra-regional importance. At this time, it was the seat of an early Celtic prince. Extensive fortifications were erected.

During the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] occupation of Germany, the Glauberg remained unoccupied, probably due to its proximity (5&amp;nbsp;km) to the fortified [[Limes Germanicus]] border. In the 4th and 5th centuries AD, it was reoccupied and became a regional centre once again, as the seat of a local king of the [[Alamanni]]. From the 7th to the 9th century, it was the site of a large [[Franks|Frankish]] fortification. Its importance grew throughout this time, and the fortifications were renewed and extended considerably.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Glauberg was incorporated into the [[Staufer]] system of castles, perhaps in an attempt to foster the growth of an urban centre. The fortifications were renovated again, and a tower-like castle was erected on the edge of the plateau; its arched [[Romanesque architecture|romanesque]] doorway survives. The whole plateau was settled at this time, [[medieval]] foundations of walls, wells and basements survive especially at its north edge. The destruction of that castle, and with it the end of human occupation on the hill, probably occurred in 1256.

==Celtic fortification (oppidum)==
[[Image:Glauberg plan.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Schematic plan of Glauberg oppidum, burial mounds and ditch systems (banks/walls: brown, ditches: yellow).]]
The earliest known fortifications might be pre-Celtic, but they reached a high point in terms of size and elaboration around the 6th or 5th century BC. They remained in use until the 2nd or 1st century BC. Their extent and dimensions mark the Glauberg as one of a network of fortified sites (or ''[[oppidum|oppida]]'') that covered most of south and west central Germany.

The northeast edge of the hill, where the slope is least severe, was disconnected from the adjacent ground by the erection of a massive ditch and bank, perhaps originally forming a [[promontory fort]]. The southern and northern edges were also fortified with walls. The walling techniques included drystone walling, the ''[[murus gallicus]]'' (a typical Celtic technique of wood and stone) and perhaps also mudbrick.

The small hilltop pond would not have sufficed to ensure water supply for the population of so large a settlement. For this reason, an annex was added to the north, with two walls running downslope, enclosing an additional triangular area of 300 x 300 m, including a spring. The point of that annex contained a huge water reservoir, measuring 150 by 60 m. At this time, the fortification was 650 m long, nearly 500 m wide, and enclosed an area of 8.5 ha.

At least two gates, a main one to the northeast and a smaller one to the south, gave access to the interior. They are fairly complex in shape, designed to make access for a possible attacker more difficult. An outer fortification was placed beyond the northeast edge of the ''oppidum''. Walls or banks to the south probably played no defensive role.&lt;ref&gt;For whole section on fortifications: F.-R. Herrmann 1990: Ringwall Glauberg; in: F.-R. Herrmann and A. Jockenhövel (eds.): ''Die Vorgeschichte Hessens'', Stuutgart: Theiss, p. 385-387&lt;/ref&gt;

Such settlements probably housed populations numbering in the thousands. For this reason, combined with their centralising economic role, Celtic oppida are sometime described as proto-urban. Nonetheless, little is known about settlement and other activity on the interior of the site. Evidence from the sites at [[Oppidum of Manching|Manching]] or [[Oberursel]]-Oberstedten suggests that there was probably a village or town-like settlement with houses, workshops and storage areas.

==Sites associated with the ''oppidum''==
Like other such sites, the Glauberg oppidum is connected with several other contemporary sites/complexes in its immediate vicinity:

==="Princely" burial mounds===
[[Image:Glauberg mound1.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The reconstructed Mound 1]]
During an [[aerial archaeology|exploratory overflight]] in 1988, local amateur historians recognised the traces of a large [[tumulus]] in a field 300 m south of the ''oppidum''. Between 1994 and 1997, the State Archaeological Service of Hesse [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]] it.&lt;ref&gt;For whole section, see http://www.keltenfuerst.de/index_1.htm ''Fürstengräber'', also Frey and Herrmann 1998, Herrmann 2002&lt;/ref&gt; 
The mound (mound 1) originally had a diameter of nearly 50 m and a height of 6 m. It was surrounded by a circular ditch 10 m wide. At the time, it must have been a visually extremely striking monument. The tumulus contained three features. An empty pit was placed at the centre, perhaps to mislead potential looters. To the northwest, a wooden chamber of 2 x 1 m contained an [[inhumation]], and to the southeast, a [[cremation]] burial had been placed in some kind of wooden container. Cremations are more commonly associated with the [[Halstatt]] phase, inhumation with the [[La Tène]] one.

The occupants of both graves were warriors, as indicated by their accompanying material: [[sword]]s and weaponry. The chamber with the inhumation was extremely well preserved and had never been looted. For this reason, it was decided to remove the whole chamber ''en bloque'' and excavate it more slowly and carefully in the State Service laboratory at [[Wiesbaden]]. The finds from the main burial chamber, each carefully wrapped in cloth, include a fine gold torc and a bronze tubular jug that had contained [[mead]].

A second tumulus (mound 2), 250 m to the south, was discovered later by [[geophysics|geophysical]] survey. Erosion and ploughing had made it totally invisible. About half the size of mound 1, it also contained a warrior, accompanied by weapons, a decorated [[fibula (brooch)|fibula]] and belt, and a gold ring. 
[[Image:Keltenfürst Glauberg vorne links 1.JPG|thumb|left|The Celtic Prince of Glauberg (ca. 500 BC)]]

The high quality of the tomb furnishings as well as other features associated with them indicate that the graves, and their occupants, were of extremely high status. They are therefore classed as "princely" burials, on a par with other well-known finds, including those at [[Vix Grave|Vix]] ([[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], [[France]]), and [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave|Hochdorf]] ([[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]).

===Earthworks and processional road===
A number of earth features (banks and ditches) are located south of the ''oppidum'', some closely associated with mound 1. They appear to play no defensive role. A small square ditch west of the mound is associated with several other features and a number of large postholes, perhaps suggesting a [[shrine]] or temple. Most strikingly, a processional way 350 m long, 10 m wide and flanked by deep ditches approached the tumulus from the southeast, far beyond the settlement perimeter. This was associated with further banks and ditches extending over an area of nearly 2 by 2&amp;nbsp;km. They also contained at least two burials, as well as the statue described below.

The lack of a defensive function and the focus on the burial mounds have led to the suggestion that the enclosure and road system had a [[ritual]] or [[sacred]] significance. Such a complex is, so far, entirely unparalleled in Celtic Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denkmalpflege-hessen.de/Keltenfurst/keltenfurst.html Keltenfürst&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The ''Keltenfürst'' (Celtic prince) of Glauberg ===
Much international attention was attracted especially by the discovery of an extremely rare find, a life-sized [[sandstone]] [[statue]] or [[stele]], dating from the 5th century BC, which was found just outside the larger tumulus.&lt;ref name="statue" /&gt; The stele, fully preserved except for its feet, depicts an armed male warrior. It measures 186&amp;nbsp;cm in height and weighs 230&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name="AID"/&gt;{{rp |68}} It is made from a type of sandstone available within a few kilometres of Glauberg. Much detail is clearly visible: his trousers, [[composite armour]] tunic, wooden shield and a typical La Tène sword hanging from his right side. The moustachioed man wears a torc with three pendants, remarkably similar to the one from the chamber in mound 1, several rings on both arms and one on the right hand. On his head, he wears a hood-like headdress crowned by two protrusions, resembling the shape of a [[mistletoe]] leaf. Such headdresses are also known from a handful of contemporary sculptures. As mistletoe is believed to have held a magical or religious significance to the Celts, it could indicate that the warrior depicted also played the role of a priest.&lt;ref name="statue"&gt;Information on statue: http://www.denkmalpflege-hessen.de/Keltenfurst/keltenfurst.html, Herrmann 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Fragments of three similar statues were also discovered in the area. It is suggested that all four statues once stood in the rectangular enclosure. Perhaps they were associated with an ancestor cult.
 
Parallels to the Glauberg warrior statue exist in the form of [[stele|stelai]] from other La Tène sites, such as the Holzgerlingen figure ([[Württemberg State Museum]] in [[Stuttgart]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landesmuseum-stuttgart.de/sammlungen/archaeologie/eisenzeit/stele/ Landesmuseum Württemberg: Stele]. Retrieved 4 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;, a pillar-stele from [[Pfalzfeld]] ([[St Goar]]) ''([[:de:Pfalzfelder Säule|de]])'', today in the [[Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn]], the [[Warrior of Hirschlanden]] and others.

===Postholes===
[[Image:Glaubergkalendarium.JPG|thumb|Reconstructed 16 wooden posts, aside mound 1]]
The purpose of the 16 postholes associated with the mound and enclosure is still undiscovered. First theories had been, that they build an astronomical calendar, to determine seasonal events or holidays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denkmalpflege-hessen.de/Archaeologie/__Kelten_in_Hessen/__kelten_in_hessen.html Kelten in Hessen], State agency for the preservation of cultural heritage. Retrieved 6 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent investigations showed, that they had been built later than the mounds, giving room for interpreting them as part of architectural elements like bridges, arches and temple structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/-01nqmr ''Offenbar doch kein Kalenderbauwerk. Rätselraten um keltische Pfosten auf dem Glauberg'']. [[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]. Retrieved 6 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Southern Hesse - a Celtic landscape==
The Glauberg is not isolated within its time and area, although it is the most northeasterly site of its type known at present. But several other important Celtic population centres or ''oppida'' are known from the [[Rhein-Main Region]] and Central Hesse. Two important fortifications, those at Dünsberg near [[Giessen]] and [[Heidetrank Oppidum|Heidetränk Oppidum]] (one of the largest urban settlements in Celtic Europe) near [[Altkönig]] in the [[Taunus|Taunus mountains]] are visible from Glauberg.  Nearby is also the Celtic salt industry at [[Bad Nauheim]].&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. the site gazetteer in F.-R. Herrmann &amp; A. Jockenhövel 1990: ''Die Vorgeschichte Hessens'', Stuttgart: Theiss, p. 305-505&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The discoveries at Glauberg have added several new perspectives to the understanding of early Celtic Europe. They have somewhat expanded the known extent of early La Tène civilization, they have thrown much light on the early development of Celtic art, and most importantly of sculpture. The warrior figure and other material support suggestions of links and contact with the civilisations of the [[Mediterranean]] at this early point. The ritual complex surrounding the tomb has added a whole new monument type to European [[prehistory]].&lt;ref&gt;Herrmann 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Sites like Glauberg, sometimes referred to as ''Fürstensitze'' (seats of princes), indicate a parallel development of social hierarchies developing across late Hallstatt Europe. Elite sites, characterised by massive fortifications, the presence of imported materials and of elaborate burials developed along the important trade routes across the continent. Glauberg must now be considered a proto-urban centre of power, trade and cult, of similar importance to such sites as [[Bibracte]], or [[Oppidum of Manching|Manching]], but especially of other "princely" fortified settlements, such as [[Heuneburg]], [[Hohenasperg]] and [[Mont Lassois]].

==Archaeological park and museum==
[[Image:Museum-Keltenwelt-am-Glauberg 0622.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Museum ''Keltenwelt'' at Glauberg]]
An archaeological park has been built, with the aim of making the site and its context accessible and comprehensible to visitors and providing a space for exhibiting the finds locally. Previously, some of the finds, including the statue, were on display in the Hessian State Museum at [[Darmstadt]].

Construction for the museum started in 2007, with completion originally projected for 2009. It opened on 5 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/-01tojz ''Eine Heimstatt für die Wetterauer Kelten'']. FAZ.NET. Accessed 5 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2015, the museum had counted around 300,000 visitors and estimated the total number of people who had come to see the ''Keltenwelt'' (i.e. including those who just explored the 30 ha open air archaeological park) at around 500,000.&lt;ref name = "AID"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Allihn|first=Karen|title=Ein Jubiläum für den Keltenfürsten| newspaper = Archäologie in Deutschland|date=April 2016| language = de |publisher=WBG|pages=68–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |68}}

==Geography==
===Boundaries===
[[File:Macdougal Street and Minetta Lane street scene NYC.jpg|thumb|left|[[MacDougal Street]] in Greenwich Village]]
The neighborhood is bordered by [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] to the east, the [[North River (Hudson River)|North River]] (part of the [[Hudson River]]) to the west, [[Houston Street]] to the south, and [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] to the north,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and roughly centered on [[Washington Square Park]] and [[New York University]]. The neighborhoods surrounding it are the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] and [[NoHo, Manhattan|NoHo]] to the east, [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] and [[Hudson Square]] to the south, and [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] and [[Union Square, Manhattan|Union Square]] to the north. The East Village was formerly considered part of the [[Lower East Side]] and has never been considered a part of Greenwich Village.&lt;ref name=EV&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFD6123FF932A35752C0A963958260 F.Y.I.], "When did the East Village become the East Village and stop being part of the Lower East Side?", Jesse McKinley, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 1, 1995. Retrieved August 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The western part of Greenwich Village is known as the [[West Village, Manhattan|West Village]]; the dividing line of its eastern border is debated. Some{{who|date=November 2017}} believe it starts at [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]] and its southern extension, a border to the west of which the neighborhood changes substantially in character and becomes heavily residential. Others{{who|date=November 2017}} say the West Village starts one avenue further east at [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], where the east-west streets in the city's grid plan start to orient themselves on an angle to the traditionally perpendicular grid plan occupying most of Manhattan. The Far West Village is another sub-neighborhood of Greenwich Village that is bordered on its west by the Hudson River and on its east by [[Hudson Street (Manhattan)|Hudson Street]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Greenwich Village is located in [[New York's 10th congressional district]], New York's 25th State Senate district, New York's 66th State Assembly district, and New York City Council's 3rd district.

Into the early 20th century, Greenwich Village was distinguished from the upper-class neighborhood of Washington Square{{spaced ndash}}based on the major landmark [[Washington Square Park]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|url=http://www.gvshp.org/history.htm|title=Village History|accessdate=January 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gold 1988, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; or Empire Ward&lt;ref name="Johns Hopkins University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Luther S.|title=Around Washington Square: An Illustrated History of Greenwich Village|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=2003|location=Baltimore|isbn=978-0-8018-7341-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 19th century.

''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'''s 1956 article on "New York (City)" (subheading "Greenwich Village") states that the southern border of the Village is [[Spring Street (Manhattan)|Spring Street]], reflecting an earlier understanding. The newer district of SoHo has since encroached on this border.

===Grid plan===

As Greenwich Village was once a rural, isolated [[Hamlet (New York)|hamlet]] to the north of the 17th century European settlement on [[Manhattan Island]], its street layout is more organic than the planned grid pattern of the 19th century [[grid plan]] (based on the [[Commissioners' Plan of 1811]]). Greenwich Village was allowed to keep the 18th century street pattern of what is now called the West Village: areas that were already built up when the plan was implemented, west of what is now [[Greenwich Avenue]] and [[Sixth Avenue (Manhattan)|Sixth Avenue]], resulted in a neighborhood whose streets are dramatically different, in layout, from the ordered structure of the newer parts of Manhattan.&lt;ref name=fny199909&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forgotten-ny.com/1999/09/greenwich-village-necrology/|title=The Street Necrology of Greenwich Village|date=November 1999|website=[[Forgotten NY]]|author=Walsh, Kevin|accessdate=August 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the neighborhood's streets are narrow and some curve at odd angles. This is generally regarded as adding to both the historic character and charm of the neighborhood. In addition, as the meandering [[Greenwich Street]] used to be on the [[Hudson River]] shoreline, much of the neighborhood west of Greenwich Street is on landfill, but still follows the older street grid.&lt;ref name=fny199909/&gt; When Sixth and [[Seventh Avenue (Manhattan)|Seventh Avenue]]s were built in the early 20th century, they were built diagonally to the existing street plan, and many older, smaller streets had to be demolished.&lt;ref name=fny199909/&gt;

Unlike the streets of most of Manhattan above Houston Street, streets in the Village typically are named rather than numbered. While some of the formerly named streets (including Factory, Herring and Amity Streets) are now numbered, they still do not always conform to the usual grid pattern when they enter the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=fny199909/&gt; For example, [[4th Street (Manhattan)|West 4th Street]] runs east-west across most of Manhattan, but runs north-south in Greenwich Village, causing it to intersect with West 10th, 11th, and 12th Streets before ending at West 13th Street.&lt;ref name=fny199909/&gt;

A large section of Greenwich Village, made up of more than 50 northern and western blocks in the area up to 14th Street, is part of a Historic District established by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]]. The District's convoluted borders run no farther south than 4th Street or St. Luke's Place, and no farther east than Washington Square East or University Place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/html/maps/maps_manh.shtml |title=Landmark Maps: Historic District Maps: Manhattan |publisher=Nyc.gov |accessdate=September 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909211747/http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/html/maps/maps_manh.shtml |archivedate=September 9, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redevelopment in that area is severely restricted, and developers must preserve the main façade and aesthetics of the buildings during renovation.

Most of the buildings of Greenwich Village are mid-rise apartments, 19th century row houses, and the occasional one-family walk-up, a sharp contrast to the high-rise landscape in [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] and [[Downtown Manhattan]].

==History==
===Early years===
[[File:Greenwich Village map circa 1760 - Project Gutenberg eText 16907.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Map of old Greenwich Village. A section of [[Bernard Ratzer]]'s map of New York and its suburbs, made ca. 1766 for [[Sir Henry Moore, 1st Baronet|Henry Moore]], Royal Governor of New York, when Greenwich was more than two miles (3 km) from the city.]]
In the 16th century, Native Americans referred to its farthest northwest corner, by the cove on the Hudson River at present-day Gansevoort Street, as Sapokanikan ("tobacco field"). The land was cleared and turned into pasture by Dutch and [[Freedman|freed African]] settlers in the 1630s, who named their settlement Noortwyck ("North district", equivalent to Northwich/Northwick). In the 1630s, Governor [[Wouter van Twiller]] farmed tobacco on {{convert|200|acre|km2}} here at his "Farm in the Woods".&lt;ref&gt;Gold 1988, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The English conquered the Dutch settlement of [[New Netherland]] in 1664, and Greenwich Village developed as a hamlet separate from the larger New York City to the south on land that would eventually become the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]]. In 1644, the eleven Dutch African settlers were freed after the first black legal protest in America.{{efn|The eleven freed blacks were Paul d'Angola, Big Manuel, Little Manuel, Manuel de Gerrit de Rens, Simon Congo, Anthony Portuguese.

The earliest known reference to the village's name as "Greenwich" dates back to 1696, in the will of Yellis Mandeville of Greenwich; however, the village was not mentioned in the city records until 1713.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stokes|first1=I.N.

The oldest house remaining in Greenwich Village is the Isaacs-Hendricks House, at 77 Bedford Street (built 1799, much altered and enlarged 1836, third story 1928).&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Walsh, ''Forgotten New York:  The Ultimate Urban Explorer's Guide to All Five Boroughs'', 2006:155.&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Church of St. Luke in the Fields]] was founded in 1820 it stood in fields south of the road (now Christopher Street) that led from Greenwich Lane (now [[Greenwich Avenue]]) down to a landing on the North River. In 1822, a [[yellow fever]] epidemic in New York encouraged residents to flee to the healthier air of Greenwich Village, and afterwards many stayed. The future site of [[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] was a [[potter's field]] from 1797 to 1823 when up to 20,000 of New York's poor were buried here, and still remain. The handsome Greek revival rowhouses on the north side of Washington Square were built about 1832, establishing the fashion of Washington Square and lower Fifth Avenue for decades to come. Well into the 19th century, the district of Washington Square was considered separate from Greenwich Village.

Greenwich Village historically was known as an important landmark on the map of American [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] culture in the early and mid-20th century. The neighborhood was known for its colorful, artistic residents and the alternative culture they propagated. Due in part to the progressive attitudes of many of its residents, the Village was a focal point of new movements and ideas, whether political, artistic, or cultural. This tradition as an enclave of [[avant-garde]] and [[alternative culture]] was established during the 19th century and continued into the 20th century, when small presses, art galleries, and experimental theater thrived.

The [[Tenth Street Studio Building]] was situated at 51 West 10th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, the building was commissioned by James Boorman Johnston{{efn|James Boorman Johnston (1822–1887) was a son of the prominent Scottish-born New York merchant John Johnston, in partnership with James Boorman (1783–1866) as Boorman &amp; Johnston, developers of [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square North]], and a founder of [[New York University]]; a group portrait of the Johnston Children 1831, is at the [[Museum of the City of New York]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Johnston Children: John Taylor Johnston (1820-1893), James Boorman Johnston (1822-1887), Margaret Taylor Johnston (1825-1875), and Emily Proudfoot Johnston (1827-1831), (painting) |url=https://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!43361!0 |publisher=SIRIS}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} and designed by [[Richard Morris Hunt]]. Its innovative design soon represented a national architectural prototype, and featured a domed central gallery, from which interconnected rooms radiated. Hunt's studio within the building housed the first architectural school in the United States. Soon after its completion in 1857, the building helped to make Greenwich Village central to the arts in New York City, drawing artists from all over the country to work, exhibit, and sell their art. In its initial years [[Winslow Homer]] took a studio there,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9405E4D9163FF934A2575BC0A961958260|title=''Evoking the World of Winslow Homer''|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 17, 1997|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Edward Lamson Henry]], and many of the artists of the [[Hudson River School]], including [[Frederic Church]] and [[Albert Bierstadt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/4aa/4aa62.htm |title=History of the Tenth Street Studio |publisher=Tfaoi.com |date=November 16, 1997 |accessdate=January 27, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512221817/http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/4aa/4aa62.htm |archivedate=May 12, 2014  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 19th century until the present, the Hotel Albert has served as a cultural icon of Greenwich Village. Opened during the 1880s and originally located at 11th Street and University Place, called the Hotel St. Stephan and then after 1902, called the Hotel Albert while under the ownership of William Ryder, it served as a meeting place, restaurant and dwelling for several important artists and writers from the late 19th century well into the 20th century. After 1902, the owner's brother [[Albert Pinkham Ryder]] lived and painted there. Some other noted guests who lived there include: [[Augustus St. Gaudens]], [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Mark Twain]], [[Hart Crane]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Anaïs Nin]], [[Thomas Wolfe]], [[Robert Lowell]], [[Horton Foote]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Andy Warhol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehotelalbert.com/history.html|title=Hotel Albert history|publisher=Thehotelalbert.com|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Christopher.

In 1924, the [[Cherry Lane Theatre]] was established. Located at 38 Commerce Street, it is New York City's oldest continuously running [[Off-Broadway]] theater. A landmark in Greenwich Village's cultural landscape, it was built as a farm silo in 1817, and also served as a tobacco warehouse and box factory before [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and other members of the [[Provincetown Players]] converted the structure into a theatre they christened the Cherry Lane Playhouse, which opened on March 24, 1924, with the play ''The Man Who Ate the Popomack''. During the 1940s [[The Living Theatre]], [[Theatre of the Absurd]], and the Downtown Theater movement all took root there, and it developed a reputation as a showcase for aspiring [[playwright]]s and emerging voices.

In one of the many Manhattan properties that [[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney]] and her husband owned, Gertrude Whitney established the ''Whitney Studio Club'' at 8 West 8th Street in 1914, as a facility where young artists could exhibit their works. By the 1930s it had evolved into her greatest legacy, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], on the site of today's [[New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture]]. The Whitney was founded in 1931, as an answer to the [[Museum of Modern Art]], founded 1928, and its collection of mostly European [[modernism]] and its neglect of [[United States|American Art]]. Gertrude Whitney decided to put the time and money into the museum after the New York [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] turned down her offer to contribute her twenty-five-year collection of [[modern art]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berman|first=Avis|title=Rebels on Eighth Street: Juliana Force and the Whitney Museum of American Art|publisher=Atheneum|year=1990|place=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1936, the renowned [[Abstract Expressionist]] artist and teacher [[Hans Hofmann]] moved his [[art school]] from E. 57th Street to 52 West 9th Street. In 1938, Hofmann moved again to a more permanent home at 52 West 8th Street. The school remained active until 1958 when Hofmann retired from teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hanshofmann.org/chronology |title=Hans Hofmann Estate, retrieved December 19, 2008 |publisher=Hanshofmann.org |accessdate=September 21, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202023453/http://www.hanshofmann.org/chronology |archivedate=December 2, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, 1947, stevedore Andy Hintz was fatally shot by hitmen [[John M. Dunn]], [[Andrew "Squint" Sheridan|Andrew Sheridan]] and [[Danny Gentile]] in front of his apartment. Before he died on January 29, he told his wife that "Johnny Dunn shot me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,853626,00.html|title=National Affairs: A Date at The Dance Hall|date=March 7, 1949|work=[[Time.com]]|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three gunmen were immediately arrested.

The Village hosted the nation's first racially integrated [[nightclub]],&lt;ref&gt;William Robert Taylor, ''Inventing Times Square: commerce and culture at the crossroads of the world'' 1991:176&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Café Society]] was opened in 1938 at 1 Sheridan Square&lt;ref&gt;Many sources give the address at 2 Sheridan Square: [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEEDD103CF933A0575AC0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Barney Josephson, Owner of Cafe Society Jazz Club, Is Dead at 86"], ''[[The New York Times]]''; see history of [http://www.axiscompany.org/history.htm# "The theater at One Sheridan Square"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011165220/http://axiscompany.org/history.htm |date=October 11, 2016 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; by Barney Josephson. Café Society showcased [[African American]] talent and was intended to be an American version of the political [[cabaret]]s that Josephson had seen in Europe before [[World War I]]. Notable performers there included: [[Pearl Bailey]], [[Count Basie]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[John Coltrane]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Billie Holiday]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Burl Ives]], [[Lead Belly]], [[Anita O'Day]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Les Paul]] and [[Mary Ford]], [[Paul Robeson]], [[Kay Starr]], [[Art Tatum]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Dinah Washington]], [[Josh White]], [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Lester Young]], and [[the Weavers]], who also in Christmas 1949, played at the [[Village Vanguard]].

The annual [[Greenwich Village Halloween Parade]], initiated in 1974 by Greenwich Village [[puppeteer]] and mask maker Ralph Lee, is the world's largest [[Halloween]] parade and America's only major nighttime parade, attracting more than 60,000 [[costume]]d participants, 2 million in-person spectators, and a worldwide television audience of over 100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halloween-nyc.com/about.php|title=History of the Parade|author=Village Halloween Parade|accessdate=July 28, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727200017/http://halloween-nyc.com/about.php|archivedate=July 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Village again became important to the bohemian scene during the 1950s, when the [[Beat Generation]] focused their energies there. Fleeing from what they saw as oppressive social conformity, a loose collection of writers, poets, artists, and students (later known as the [[Beat generation|Beats]]) and the [[Beatniks]], moved to Greenwich Village, and to [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]] in [[San Francisco]], in many ways creating the east-coast and west-coast predecessors respectively to the [[Haight-Ashbury]]-[[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Hippy|hippie scene]] of the next decade. The Village (and surrounding New York City) would later play central roles in the writings of, among others, [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Marianne Moore]], [[Maya Angelou]], [[Rod McKuen]], and [[Dylan Thomas]], who collapsed at the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] and died at [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center|St. Vincents Hospital]] at 170 West 12th Street, in the Village after drinking at the [[White Horse Tavern (New York City)|White Horse Tavern]] on November 5, 1953.

[[Off-Off-Broadway]] began in Greenwich Village in 1958 as a reaction to [[Off Broadway]], and a "complete rejection of commercial theatre".&lt;ref&gt;Viagas (2004, p. 72)&lt;/ref&gt; Among the first venues for what would soon be called "Off-Off-Broadway" (a term supposedly coined by [[critic]] Jerry Tallmer of the ''[[Village Voice]]'') were coffeehouses in Greenwich Village, in particular, the [[Caffe Cino]] at 31 Cornelia Street, operated by the eccentric [[Joe Cino]], who early on took a liking to actors and playwrights and agreed to let them stage plays there without bothering to read the plays first, or to even find out much about the content. Also integral to the rise of Off-Off-Broadway were [[Ellen Stewart]] at [[La MaMa, E.T.C.|La MaMa]], originally located at 321 E. 9th Street, and [[Al Carmines]] at the Judson Poets' Theater, located at [[Judson Memorial Church]] on the south side of [[Washington Square Park]].

[[File:Blue Note Jazz Club, New York City.jpg|thumb|[[Blue Note Jazz Club]]]]
The Village had a cutting-edge cabaret and music scene. ''[[The Village Gate]]'', the ''[[Village Vanguard]]'', and ''[[Blue Note Jazz Club|The Blue Note]]'' (since 1981), regularly hosted some of the biggest names in [[jazz]]. Greenwich Village also played a major role in the development of the [[American folk music revival|folk music scene]] of the 1960s. Music clubs included ''[[Gerde's Folk City]]'', ''[[The Bitter End]],'' ''[[Cafe Au Go Go]]'', ''[[Cafe Wha?]]'', ''[[The Gaslight Cafe]]'' and ''[[The Bottom Line (venue)|The Bottom Line]]''. Three of the four members of [[the Mamas &amp; the Papas]] met there. Guitarist and folk singer [[Dave Van Ronk]] lived there for many years. Village resident and cultural icon [[Bob Dylan]] by the mid-60s had become one of the world's foremost popular songwriters, and often developments in Greenwich Village would influence the simultaneously occurring [[folk rock]] movement in [[San Francisco]] and elsewhere, and vice versa. Dozens of other cultural and popular icons got their start in the Village's nightclub, theater, and coffeehouse scene during the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, including [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]], [[Bette Midler]], [[the Lovin' Spoonful]], [[Simon &amp; Garfunkel]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[James Taylor]], [[Eric Andersen]], [[Joan Baez]], [[the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]], [[the Velvet Underground]], [[the Kingston Trio]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Richie Havens]], [[Maria Muldaur]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Janis Ian]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Laura Nyro]], and [[Nina Simone]]. The Greenwich Village of the 1950s and 1960s was at the center of [[Jane Jacobs]]'s book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'', which defended it and similar communities, while criticizing common [[urban renewal]] policies of the time.

Founded by New York-based artist [[Mercedes Matter]] and her students, the [[New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture]] is an art school formed in the mid-1960s in the Village. Officially opened September 23, 1964, the school is still active, at 8 W. 8th Street, the site of the original [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyss.org/schoolhistory.asp|title=New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture: The School: Its History|last1=Matter|first1=Mercedes|date=2002|website=nyss.org|publisher=New York Studio School|access-date=February 27, 2016|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426072430/http://www.nyss.org/schoolhistory.asp|archivedate=April 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenwich Village was home to a safe house used by the radical [[anti-war movement]] known as the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]]. On March 6, 1970, their safehouse was destroyed when an explosive device that they were constructing was accidentally detonated, killing three of their members ([[Ted Gold]], [[Terry Robbins]], and [[Diana Oughton]]).

The Village has been a center for movements that challenged the wider American culture, for example, its role in the [[gay liberation]] movement. The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the [[LGBT community|gay community]] against a [[police raid]] that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the [[Stonewall Inn]], 53 [[Christopher Street (Manhattan)|Christopher Street]]. They are widely considered to constitute the single most important event leading to the [[gay liberation]] movement and the modern fight for [[LGBT rights in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Park Service|title=Workforce Diversity: The Stonewall Inn, National Historic Landmark National Register Number: 99000562|url=http://www.nps.gov/diversity/stonewall.htm|publisher=US Dept. of Interior|year=2008|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html|title=Obama inaugural speech references Stonewall gay-rights riots|publisher=North Jersey Media Group|date=January 21, 2013|accessdate=July 28, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530065722/http://www.northjersey.com/news/2012_Presidential_Election/Obama_inaugural_speech_references_Stonewall_riots.html|archivedate=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 23, 2015, the Stonewall Inn was the first landmark in New York City to be recognized by the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]] on the basis of its status in LGBT history,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/nyc-grants-landmark-status-to-gay-rights-movement-building-1.1361241|title=NYC grants landmark status to gay rights movement building|author=Associated Press|publisher=North Jersey Media Group|date=June 23, 2015|accessdate=June 23, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201003/http://www.northjersey.com/news/nyc-grants-landmark-status-to-gay-rights-movement-building-1.1361241|archivedate=March 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on June 24, 2016, the [[Stonewall National Monument]] was named the first [[List of U.S. National Monuments|U.S. National Monument]] dedicated to the LGBTQ-rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/25/nyregion/stonewall-inn-named-national-monument-a-first-for-gay-rights-movement.html|title=Stonewall Inn Named National Monument, a First for the Gay Rights Movement|author=Eli Rosenberg|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 24, 2016|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwich Village contains the world's oldest gay and lesbian bookstore, [[Oscar Wilde Bookshop]], founded in 1967, while The Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center – best known as simply "The Center" – has occupied the former Food &amp; Maritime Trades High School at 208 West 13th Street since 1984. In 2006, the Village was the scene of [[2006 Greenwich Village assault case|an assault involving seven lesbians and a straight man]] that sparked appreciable media attention, with strong statements defending both sides of the case.

Nevertheless, residents of Greenwich Village still possess a strong community identity and are proud of their neighborhood's unique history and fame, and its well-known liberal live-and-let-live attitudes.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

Historically, local residents and preservation groups have been concerned about development in the Village and have fought to preserve its architectural and historic integrity. In the 1960s, [[Margot Gayle]] led a group of citizens to preserve the [[Jefferson Market Courthouse]] (later reused as Jefferson Market Library)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/nyregion/30gayle.html|work=The New York Times|title=Margot Gayle, Urban Preservationist and Crusader With Style, Dies at 100|date=September 30, 2008|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other citizen groups fought to keep traffic out of Washington Square Park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/washingtonsquarepark/highlights/9763|author=NYC Dept. of Parks and Recreation|title=Shirley Hayes and the Preservation of Washington Square Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jane Jacobs]], using the Village as an example of a vibrant urban community, advocated to keep it that way.

Since then, preservation has been a part of the Village ethos. Shortly after the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) was established in 1965, it acted to protect parts of Greenwich Village, designating the small [[Charlton-King-Vandam Historic District]] in 1966, which contains the city's largest concentration of row houses in the Federal style, as well as a significant concentration of Greek Revival houses, and the even smaller [[MacDougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District]] in 1967, a group of 22 houses sharing a common back garden, built in the Greek Revival style and later renovated with Colonial Revival façades. In 1969, the LPC designated the Greenwich Village Historic District — for four decades, the city's largest — despite preservationists' advocacy for the entire neighborhood to be designated an historic district. Advocates continued to pursue their goal of additional designation, spurred in particular by the increased pace of development in the 1990s.

Several contextual rezonings were enacted in Greenwich Village in recent years to limit the size and height of allowable new development in the neighborhood, and to encourage the preservation of existing buildings. The following were proposed by the GVSHP and passed by the [[New York City Department of City Planning|City Planning Commission]]:
* Far West Village Rezoning, approved in 2005, was the first downzoning in Manhattan in many years, putting in place new height caps, thus ending construction of high-rise waterfront towers in much of the Village and encouraging the reuse of existing buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/new-york/city-landmarks-looking-to-rezone-part-of-west/13921/|title=City, Landmarks Looking to Rezone Part of West Village|accessdate=March 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Points of interest==
Greenwich Village includes several collegiate institutions. Since the 1830s, [[New York University]] (NYU) has had a campus there. In 1973 NYU moved its campus in the [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]] section of the [[West Bronx]] to Greenwich Village. In 1976 [[Yeshiva University]] established the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]] in the northern part of Greenwich Village. In the 1980s [[Hebrew Union College]] was built in Greenwich Village. [[The New School]], with its [[Parsons The New School for Design]], a division of The New School, and the School's Graduate School expanded in the 2000s, with the renovated, award-winning design of the Sheila C. Johnson Design Center at 66 Fifth Avenue on 13th Street. The [[Cooper Union]] is located in Greenwich Village, at [[Astor Place]], near [[St. Mark's Place]] on the border of the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. [[Pratt Institute]] established its latest Manhattan campus in an [[adaptive reuse|adaptively reused]] [[Arnold Brunner|Brunner &amp; Tryon]]-designed loft building on 14th Street, east of Seventh Avenue. The university campus building expansion was followed by a [[gentrification]] process in the 1980s.
[[File:ChristopherPark3358.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Christopher Park, part of the [[Stonewall National Monument]]&lt;ref name=StonewallNationalMonument1/&gt;]]
The historic [[Washington Square Park]] is the center and heart of the neighborhood. Additionally, the Village has several other, smaller parks: Christopher, Father Fagan, Minetta Triangle, Petrosino Square, Little Red Square, and Time Landscape. There are also city playgrounds, including [[DeSalvio Playground]], Minetta, [[Thompson Street (Manhattan)|Thompson Street]], Bleecker Street, Downing Street, Mercer Street, Cpl. John A. Seravelli, and William Passannante Ballfield. Perhaps the most famous, though, is "The Cage", officially known as the [[West Fourth Street Courts]]. Sitting atop the [[West Fourth Street – Washington Square (New York City Subway)|West Fourth Street – Washington Square]] subway station ({{NYCS West 4th}} trains) at Sixth Avenue, the courts are easily accessible to [[basketball]] and [[American handball]] players from all over New York. The Cage has become one of the most important tournament sites for the citywide "[[Streetball]]" amateur basketball tournament. Since 1975, New York University's art collection has been housed at the [[Grey Art Gallery]] bordering Washington Square Park, at 100 Washington Square East. The Grey Art Gallery is notable for its museum-quality exhibitions of contemporary art.

The Village has a bustling performing arts scene. It is home to many [[Off Broadway]] and [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theaters; for instance, ''[[Blue Man Group]]'' has taken up residence in the Astor Place Theater. ''[[The Village Gate]]'' (until 1992), the ''[[Village Vanguard]]'' and ''[[Blue Note Jazz Club|The Blue Note]]'' are still presenting some of the biggest names in [[jazz]] on a regular basis. Other music clubs include ''[[The Bitter End]],'' and ''[[Lion's Den (nightclub)|Lion's Den]]''. The village has its own orchestra aptly named the ''[[Greenwich Village Orchestra]]''. Comedy clubs dot the Village as well, including ''[[Comedy Cellar]]'', where many American [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] comedians got their start.

Several publications have offices in the Village, most notably the citywide newsweekly ''[[The Village Voice]]'', and the monthly magazines ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' and ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]''. The [[National Audubon Society]], having relocated its national headquarters from a mansion in [[Carnegie Hill]] to a restored and very [[green building|green]], former industrial building in [[NoHo, Manhattan|NoHo]], relocated to smaller but even greener [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certified digs at 225 Varick Street,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/realestate/06sqft.html|work=The New York Times|title=Audubon's New Home Brings the Outdoors In|first=Claire|last=Wilson|date=April 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Houston Street near the [[Film Forum]].

==Education==
Greenwich Village residents are zoned to two elementary schools: PS 3, Melser Charrette School, and [[PS 41]], Greenwich Village School. Residents are zoned to Baruch Middle School 104. Residents apply to various New York City high schools.

'''Half Price Books, Records, Magazines, Incorporated''' is the largest family-owned chain of new and used [[bookstore]]s in the [[United States]]. The company’s original motto is "We buy and sell anything printed or recorded except yesterday's newspaper", and many of the used books, music, and movies for sale in each location are purchased from local residents. The corporate office is located in the flagship [[Texas State Highway Loop 12|Northwest Highway]] location in [[Dallas, Texas]]. Half Price Books now operates more than 127 stores (including outlets) in 17 states.&lt;ref name="Cobb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Stores|url=https://www.hpb.com/stores/|publisher=Half Price Books|accessdate=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founders Ken Gjemre and Pat Anderson opened the first store in 1972 in a former [[laundromat]] in Dallas, Texas, filling the shelves with 2,000 books out of their personal libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituaries: Passings Ken Gjemre, 81; Left Corporate Career to Found Bookstore Chain|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/jun/01/local/me-passing1.3|accessdate=25 July 2017|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=June 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pat Anderson’s daughter, Sharon Anderson Wright, is the company’s current President and [[CEO]]. In 2009, Sharon's sister Ellen O'Neal stepped up to the position of Chairperson of the Board in order to become more involved with the family business.

==Philanthropy==
The Half Price Books original mission statement includes the promise to "promote [[literacy]] and be kind to the environment."&lt;ref name="Social"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lasica|first1=JD|title=Where to Find Nonprofit, Independent &amp; Progressive Booksellers|url=http://www.socialbrite.org/tag/half-price-books/|accessdate=July 25, 2017|publisher=SocialBrite}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers and librarians, for example, are offered a year-round 10% discount on purchases.&lt;ref name=Social /&gt; Each year, every Half Price Books store holds a book drive to collect new or gently used children's books, building "Half Pint Libraries" at non-profit organizations and schools in the communities it serves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Half Pint Library|url=http://b.hpb.com/half-pint-library-book-drive/|publisher=Half Price Books|accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company has promoted [[recycling]] and reusing, and the sound management of paper, energy and water resources. In 2008, Half Price Books launched a formal environmental education initiative called “B(eco)me Green” to help spread knowledge about the health of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.becomegreen.org|website=b(eco)me green|title=Become Green|accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the chain donates millions of books and its overstock inventory to non-profit organizations around the world such as [[Feed the Children]] and [[American Red Cross]]. It also gives some of its books to [[Better World Books]], a for-profit on-line bookseller.

==Publishing==
Half Price Books publishes some of the books it sells, inexpensively reprinting non-copyrighted titles or acquiring the U.S. or English language rights from another publisher. Half Price Books reprints these titles under its publishing arm, Hackberry Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trademarkia.com/hackberry-press-75664818.html|title=Hackberry Press {{en dash}} Trademark|publisher=Trademarkia|accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Hackberry Press titles is the Half Price Books children's storybook series ''[[Say Good Night to Illiteracy]]'', with 13 editions in print. All proceeds from the series benefit family [[literacy]] organizations such as Reach Out and Read and the National Center for Family Literacy.

The company is a strong proponent of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] freedom of speech and Americans’ right to knowledge and the expression of ideas.  Its website “deletecensorship.org” supports imaginative and courageous books, including those that address controversial topics and have been censored or banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deletecensorship.org|website=DeleteCensorship|title=Delete Censorship|accessdate=February 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''I'll Remember April''''' is a 1999 American [[family film|family]] [[drama film|drama]] film starring [[Pat Morita]], [[Pam Dawber]], [[Haley Joel Osment]], [[Mark Harmon]] and [[Yuki Tokuhiro]].  It was directed by [[Bob Clark]].

==Plot==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Four children capture a [[Japan]]ese soldier who washes ashore during the [[World War II|Second World War]].

Although the horrors of World War II are far removed from the Pacific Coast community where adolescent Duke Cooper (Trevor Morgan) and his three best chums play soldier, experiment with swearing, and earnestly patrol the beach for Japanese submarines, the realities of the war are about to come crashing down around them. Not when a Japanese soldier, stranded and wounded when his sub quickly dived, washes ashore; his capture by the foursome merely allows for more playtime and thoughts of becoming heroes. It's coming because Duke's older brother is on some island awaiting combat and the black sedans with military tags have already begun rolling through town to deliver their grim announcements. And Duke's Japanese American pal Willie Tanaka (Yuki Tokuhiro), all three feet and 55 pounds of him, has suddenly become a threat to national security, so he, his mother, and grandfather are soon to be shipped away to an internment camp.

The '''Indian Head gold pieces''' or '''Pratt-Bigelow gold coins''' were two separate coin series, identical in design, struck by the [[United States Mint]]: a two-and-a-half-dollar piece, or [[quarter eagle]], and a five-dollar coin, or [[half eagle]]. The quarter eagle was struck from 1908 to 1915 and from 1925–1929. The half eagle was struck from 1908 to 1916, and in 1929. The pieces remain the only US circulating coins with recessed designs. These coins were the last of their denominations to be struck for circulation, ending series that began in the 1790s.

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]], from 1904, vigorously advocated new designs for United States coins, and had the Mint engage his friend, the sculptor [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]], to design five coins (the four gold pieces and the cent) that could be changed without congressional authorization.  Before his death in August 1907, Saint-Gaudens completed designs for the [[eagle (United States coin)|eagle]] ($10 piece) and [[double eagle]], although both required subsequent work to make them fully suitable for coining.

With the eagle and double eagle released into circulation by the end of 1907, the Mint turned its attention to the half eagle and quarter eagle, originally planning to duplicate the double eagle's design.  The Mint had difficulty fitting the required inscriptions on the small gold coins. President Roosevelt, in April 1908, convinced Mint Director [[Frank Leach]] that it would be a better idea to strike a design similar to that of the eagle, but below the background, to secure a high-relief effect.  Such coins were designed by Boston sculptor [[Bela Lyon Pratt]] at the request of the President's friend, [[William Sturgis Bigelow]].  After some difficulty, the Mint was successful in this work, though Pratt was unhappy at modifications made by the Mint's engravers, headed by longtime Chief Engraver [[Charles E. Barber]].

The two pieces were struck until [[World War I]] caused gold to vanish from circulation, and then again in the late 1920s.  Neither coin circulated much; the quarter eagle saw popularity as a Christmas present.  In 1933, President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] stopped the issuance of gold in coin form, and recalled many pieces which were in private or bank hands.

== Inception ==

{{for|additional detail on the origin of the idea for the 1907–1908 United States gold coin redesign|Saint-Gaudens double eagle#Inception|Indian Head eagle#Inception}}

In 1904, [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]] complained about the artistic quality of American coinage to his [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]], [[Leslie Mortier Shaw]], and asked if it were possible to hire a private sculptor such as the President's friend [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] to give modern, artistic designs to US coins.{{sfn|Moran|2008|p=216}}  At Roosevelt's instigation, Shaw had the Mint (part of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]]) hire Saint-Gaudens to redesign five denominations of US coinage that could be changed without an [[Act of Congress]]: the cent and the four gold pieces (the [[quarter eagle]], [[half eagle]], [[eagle (United States coin)|eagle]] and [[double eagle]]).{{sfn|Moran|2008|p=235}}  By the [[Mint Act of 1792]], an "eagle" was made equivalent to ten dollars.{{sfn|Hobson|1971|p=113}}

Mint officials originally assumed that whatever design was selected for the double eagle would simply be scaled down for the three lower denominations.  In May 1907, however, President Roosevelt decided that the eagle and double eagle would bear very different designs, a departure from past practice.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=317–318}}  In August (the month of Saint-Gaudens' death from cancer),{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=105}} outgoing Mint Director [[George E. Roberts]] wrote, "no instructions have been received from the President as to the half and quarter eagle, but I expected that the eagle design would be used upon them".{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=106–107}}  After considerable difficulties, the Mint issued the eagle and double eagle based on Saint-Gaudens' designs later that year.  The eagle featured Liberty wearing an Indian [[War bonnet|headdress]] on the obverse and a perched [[bald eagle]] on the reverse; the double eagle featured Liberty striding forward on the obverse and a flying eagle on the reverse.{{sfn|Hobson|1971|pp=159–160}}

Due to the difficulties with the two larger coins, little attention was given to the half eagle and quarter eagle until late 1907.  On November 28, 1907, Treasury Secretary [[George Cortelyou]] wrote in a letter that the double eagle design was to be used for the two small gold pieces.  On December 2, Mint Director [[Frank Leach]] instructed the [[Philadelphia Mint]] to prepare coinage dies for the small pieces, using the double eagle design.  Chief Engraver [[Charles E. Barber]] replied  a week later that it would be difficult to put all the legends that were required by law on the new pieces, such as the name of the country.  On the double eagle, "[[E Pluribus Unum]]" is placed on the edge, an impractical setting on pieces about the size of the [[nickel (United States coin)|nickel]] and [[dime (United States coin)|dime]].{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=318}}  Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis forwarded Barber's letter to Leach with his own note, stating, "I know it will be difficult to put the inscription 'E Pluribus Unum' on the periphery of a quarter eagle, but I do not see where else it can [go] and we must try to do it".{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=318–319}}

Barber was assigned the task of solving these difficulties.  He planned to use his low-relief version of Saint-Gaudens' double eagle design, but he made slow progress on the assignment. Leach wrote to Saint-Gaudens' attorney to ask if the sculptor's assistant [[Henry Hering]] could do the work.  Hering was willing, and asked for enlarged models of the double eagle designs.  Barber opposed bringing in outsiders, citing delays in the preparation of the earlier gold coin designs which he attributed to the Saint-Gaudens studio: "it is entirely unnecessary to trouble Mr. Hering any further, unless another year is to be wasted in vain endeavor".{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=321}}  On January 3, 1908, Leach wrote to Hering to inform him that all work would be done by the Mint.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=321}}

== Innovation ==

The President's friend, Dr. [[William Sturgis Bigelow]], had been in Japan for most of 1907; on his return to his Boston home he heard about the Saint-Gaudens coinage from Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]].  Bigelow was one of a number of Roosevelt's friends given early specimens of the double eagle.  He wrote to the President on January 8, 1908, praising the Saint-Gaudens coins and stating that he was working with a Boston sculptor, [[Bela Pratt]], on an idea that would allow coins to be struck in high relief.  Pieces struck in this manner would have the designs protected from wear and be able to stack easily (both problems with high relief coins).  The President responded to express his interest on January 10, and Pratt was soon busy on a model for him to examine.  Roosevelt did not then tell the Mint of the new proposal.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=324–326}}

[[File:Pratt plaster models.png|thumb|240px|left|Bela Pratt's plaster models for the half eagle]]

The newly released eagle and double eagle had provoked considerable controversy over their omission of the motto "[[In God We Trust]]", and with Congress already preparing to require the motto's use, Leach ordered work suspended on the half and quarter eagle on January 18.  The Mint had not expected to have to put "In God We Trust" on small coins of the double eagle design, on which it was already having trouble finding space for the other required legends.  On the assumption the bill would succeed, Leach had Barber continue with his work, and at least one pattern half eagle was struck on February 26 for Leach to show the President.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=196}}

Pratt completed plaster models for the coin, using the obverse design for the ten-dollar piece as the basis, but using a photograph of an unknown, male Indian from his photo collection rather than Saint-Gaudens' female Liberty.  He displayed one model in his [[Connecticut]] studio, and sent another to Bigelow for presentation to the President the next time the two friends met.  Roosevelt and Bigelow had lunch with Mint Director Leach on April 3.  The President was enthusiastic about the proposed coin.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=326–328}}  Leach recalled in his memoirs:

[[File:NNC-US-1907-G$10-Indian Head (no motto).jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Indian Head eagle]], designed by Saint-Gaudens, was the basis for the designs for the smaller gold pieces.]]

{{quote|Originally it was the intention to give the $5 and $2.50 pieces the same design as that used on the double eagle or $20 piece, but before final action to that end was taken President Roosevelt invited me to lunch with him at the White House. His purpose was to have me meet Doctor William Sturgis Bigelow of Boston, a lover of art and friend of the President, who was showing great interest in the undertaking for improving the appearance of American coins, and who had a new design for the smaller gold coins. It was his idea that the commercial needs of the country required coins that would "stack" evenly, and that the preservation of as much as possible of the flat plane of the piece was desirable. A coin, therefore, with the lines of the design, figures, and letters depressed or incused, instead of being raised or in relief, would meet the wishes of the bankers and business men, and at the same time introduce a novelty in coinage that was artistic as well as adaptable to the needs of business.{{sfn|Leach|1917|p=381}}}}

[[File:Indian coin group.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Examples of the Indian Head gold pieces grouped with modern coins for size comparison purposes]]

As a result of the White House lunch meeting, Leach agreed to abandon the idea that the double eagle design be used for the small gold pieces, and to cooperate with Bigelow and Pratt in the making of the new coins.  Leach even undertook to reimburse Pratt's fee of $300 to Bigelow from government funds.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=329}}  The President wanted to see Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle from the ten-dollar piece adapted in a recessed surface for the smaller pieces, and, if it did not constitute a change of design, used on the ten-dollar piece as well (a project that did not go beyond the talking stage).  Bigelow wrote to Pratt on May 1 after conferring with Leach, stating that the Mint Director would likely not object if Pratt were to improve Saint-Gaudens' standing eagle, but "I would not, if I were you, get too far from the original, as the President likes it.  Perhaps you can make him like it better."{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=330}}

Dies had been cut for the Saint-Gaudens half eagle, causing Leach to ask for a legal opinion on whether that constituted a change of design—if it did, no further change could be made for 25&amp;nbsp;years without an Act of Congress.  The opinion must have been satisfactory, as Roosevelt approved Pratt's obverse design in mid-May, subject to minor changes requested by the Mint.  Leach decided that both the Mint and Pratt would make versions of the standing eagle reverse; Pratt's was adopted.  Pratt sent the models and casts to the Mint on June 29.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=331–332}}  Barber did not make master dies based on Pratt's work until he returned from his August vacation at [[Ocean Grove, New Jersey]].  Experimental pieces to a total face value of $75 (likely ten half eagles and ten quarter eagles) were sent to Leach in Washington from the Philadelphia Mint on September 21.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=333}}  Leach showed the pieces to the President, who kept a half eagle and gave it to Bigelow.  As Leach had worked against practices that allowed pattern coins to leave the Mint, the coin sent to Bigelow may have been the only pattern not to be melted.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=334–335}}  The present location of the coin is not known; no pattern coins of the Indian Head gold pieces are presently known to exist.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=368}}  Leach approved the designs subject to some "improvements" which Barber wanted to make.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=333}}  The Mint Director wrote to Superintendent Landis on September 26,

{{quote|I desire that this shall be accomplished as soon as possible as I am under obligation to the President to have several thousand pieces coined by the first of November next and I want enough half eagle dies prepared so that a couple of pairs at least can be supplied [to] Denver and San Francisco.  The quarter eagle will be coined only at your institution.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=333}}}}

After production of the new coins began, Bigelow received one of each; he showed them to Pratt who wrote to his mother, "They have 'knocked spots' out of my design at the mint.  They let their die cutter spoil it, which he did most thoroughly&amp;nbsp;... but they tried to retouch it and gee!  They made a mess of it.  With a few deft strokes the butcher or blacksmith [Barber] who is at the head of things there, changed it from a thing that I was proud of to one [of which] I am ashamed."{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=339}}

== Design ==

[[File:NNC-US-1907-G$20-Saint Gaudens (Arabic).jpg|thumb|240px|Saint-Gaudens' double eagle design, which the Mint hoped to modify for the smaller gold coins]]

The half eagle and quarter eagle are identical in design, and are unique in American coinage in having incuse (engraved, as opposed to bas-relief) designs.{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|p=264}}  The obverse features the head of a Native American man, wearing a headdress and facing left.  The designer's initials, BLP, are found just above the date.  The reverse features a standing eagle on a bunch of arrows, its left talon holding an olive branch in place.  The [[mint mark]] is found to the left of the arrowheads.{{sfn|Akers|2008|pp=10–11}}

Although Saint-Gaudens' design for the eagle had featured Liberty in an Indian-style headdress, no attempt was made to make her features appear to be Native American.  According to numismatist Mike Fuljenz in his book on early 20th century American gold coinage, the obverse of the eagle had featured "Lady Liberty topped with a fanciful head covering designed to look like an Indian headdress".{{sfn|Fuljenz|2010|p=16}}  Until Saint-Gaudens' and Pratt's pieces were struck, only Mint Chief Engraver [[James Longacre]] had attempted to depict Indians on US circulating coinage (in the 1850s), with his [[Indian Head cent]] and Indian Princess designs for the gold dollar and three-dollar pieces.  After Pratt, only [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]]'s depiction of an Indian in 1913 on the [[Buffalo nickel]] would appear until the 2000 arrival of the [[Sacagawea dollar]].{{sfn|Fuljenz|2010|p=16}}

Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]] in 1970 dismissed complaints made at the time of issuance that the Indian was too thin: "the Indian is far from emaciated, and the coins show more imagination and daring of design than almost any other issue in American history.  Pratt deserves to be admired for his medals and coins."{{sfn|Vermeule|1971|p=121}}  Vermeule suggests that Pratt's design "marked a transition, in the 'emaciated' Indian at least, to [[naturalism (arts)|naturalism]]".{{sfn|Vermeule|1971|p=121}}

Breen suggests the sunken surfaces were similar to those on coins from Egypt's [[Fourth dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]].  Under the [[Mint Act of 1792]], the obverse was to bear an "impression emblematic of Liberty"; he notes that a Native American on the obverse was particularly appropriate "for after all the Indians were free peoples before the white man's laws made them third-class citizens" and suggests that Pratt's eagle, before it was modified by Barber, was "worthy of [[John James Audubon|J.J. Audubon]]".{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=502}}

== Production, circulation, and collecting ==

[[File:Frank A Leach.jpg|thumb|200px|Mint Director [[Frank A. Leach]] thought well of the new coins despite the controversy.]]

Dies for the half eagle were sent to the mints in [[Denver]] and [[San Francisco]]; both western mints reported difficulties in striking the new pieces.  Landis wrote to his counterparts at the other mints, advising them that the planchets, or blanks, needed to be shaved very slightly to strike properly.  The new coins proved to be thinner than earlier coins of their denomination, due to the field being raised above the design.  This meant that automated sorting machines could not reliably sort them when mixed with earlier coins.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=344}}

The new gold pieces entered circulation in early November 1908, attracting some negative comment.{{sfn|Taxay|1983|p=326}}  Philadelphia numismatist Samuel Chapman wrote to Roosevelt in early December to criticize the new coins.  The indentations in the new coins would harbor dirt and germs, Chapman argued; the coins could be easily counterfeited by carving a disc of metal.  They could not adequately stack, and they were in any event not handsome, with the Indian "emaciated".{{sfn|Taxay|1983|pp=326–328}}

According to numismatic historian Roger Burdette, "Chapman's letter caused some consternation at the White House".{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=358}}  The President prepared a reply in which he expressed himself strongly to Chapman, but Bigelow persuaded him to substitute a milder letter over Bigelow's signature, defending the new coins.{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=358–359}}  Bigelow's letter replied to Chapman's complaint about the Indian, "The answer to this is that the head was taken from a recent photograph of an Indian whose health was excellent.  Perhaps Mr. Chapman has in mind the fatter but less characteristic type of Indian sometimes seen on the reservations."{{sfn|Fuljenz|2010|p=9}} Chapman wrote again, and had the correspondence published in the numismatic press, but no one at the [[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] Roosevelt White House bothered to reply, according to Burdette, "the new coins were issued and would remain as they were for twenty-five years, or until Congress ordered them changed".{{sfn|Burdette|2006|pp=358–359}}  Leach wrote to Bigelow on January 2, 1909, "I was somewhat amused by their savage attack, and should have liked to have been in a position to reply to this unjust criticism.  However, I am pleased to say that adverse criticism of the coins is an exception.  I feel very well pleased with the result."{{sfn|Burdette|2006|p=360}}

Both the half and quarter eagle were struck each year through 1915.  While "hard money" circulated in quantity in the West, in the East banknotes were much more common.  A common use of the small gold pieces was as Christmas presents—the pieces would be produced at the various mints late in the year, be purchased from banks in December and return to vaults by late January.  The establishment of the [[Federal Reserve System]] in 1913 increased the circulation of banknotes, and the Mint ceased to strike quarter eagles after 1915 and half eagles after 1916.{{sfn|Fuljenz|2010|p=11}}  An additional factor was the economic unrest caused by [[World War I]], causing gold prices to rise and coins made of that metal to vanish from circulation.  After the war, gold did not return to circulation, and most gold coins struck were double eagles, used for international transactions and backing for gold certificates.{{sfn|Bowers|2004|p=240}}

The quarter eagle remained popular as a Christmas gift but did not initially come back into production as the Treasury held stocks of the pieces from the prewar years.  This surplus was slow to dissipate, as gift givers preferred the older Liberty Head quarter eagle that had been struck until 1908.  With the Liberty Head pieces becoming rarer and acquiring a premium above face value, the quarter eagle was finally struck again in 1925, principally to be given as presents.{{sfn|Lange|2006|p=164}}  The 1925 quarter eagle was struck only at Denver, and it was then struck from 1926 to 1929 only at Philadelphia.{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|p=249}}  With the economic collapse which started [[the Depression]], the quarter eagle was not called for in commerce, and the Mint halted production.{{sfn|Fuljenz|2010|p=11}}

[[File:1911-D Indian Head quarter eagle reverse detail.jpg|thumb|left|The mint mark is located to the left of the arrowhead]]
The half eagle was not struck again until 1929, at Philadelphia.  Coins of that date have a rarity not reflected in the mintage of 668,000 as few entered commerce.  Gold coins not released were melted in the mid-1930s, along with those recalled from banks and private holders, after President [[Franklin Roosevelt]] ended the issuance of gold coins in 1933.  Roosevelt's actions put an end to the quarter and half eagle series, which had begun in 1796 and 1795, respectively.{{sfn|Akers|2008|p=122}}{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|pp=243, 253}}{{sfn|Lange|2006|p=165}}

There are only 15 different Indian Head quarter eagles by date and mintmark; the key is the 1911 struck at Denver (1911-D), which the 2014 ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'' values at $2,850 even in well-circulated VF (Very Fine, or 20 on the [[coin grading|Mint State]] scale) condition.{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|p=249}}  The half eagle series is longer; 24 pieces by date and mint mark.  The final entry, 1929 is the key date for the half eagle series, followed by the 1909-O, struck at the [[New Orleans Mint]] in its final year of operation.{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|p=264}}

The '''International Film Music Critics Association''' ('''IFMCA''') is a professional association for [[music journalism|online, print and radio journalists]] who specialize in writing about [[film score|original film and television music]].

==History and purpose==
The IFMCA was founded in the late 1990s as the '''Film Music Critics Jury''' by film music journalist [[Mikael Carlsson]] (now the owner of film music record label [[MovieScore Media]]), and after period of inactivity was re-launched in 2003 under its new title.

Its membership includes 65 journalists from 16 different countries who write for such high-profile film and soundtrack-related publications and websites as [[Film Score Monthly]], [[Filmtracks.com|Filmtracks]], [[SoundtrackNet]], [[Music from the Movies]] and [[UnderScores]], as well as more mainstream publications such as [[Ain't It Cool News]], [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' and the [[Irish Times]]. Members of the IFMCA have also been involved in writing [[liner notes]] for major film music record labels such as [[Film Score Monthly]], [[Varèse Sarabande]], [[Intrada Records]], La-La Land Records and [[Music Box Records]].

The aim of the group is to promote original film music and the work of film music composers as legitimate artists worthy of recognition from the mainstream film and music media, and to publicize the work of its members in pursuing this aim. To this end, the group maintains a website documenting its activities; operates a central online review interface which provides links to articles, reviews and interviews written by its members; organizes an annual awards event, the IFMCA Awards, celebrating music for films written during the preceding year; and is involved in organizing major international film music festivals, such as those in [[Tenerife International Film Music Festival|Tenerife]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Home |url=http://www.fimucite.com/f4/en/ |title=Tenerife International Film Music Festival |publisher=Fimucite.com |accessdate=11 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711002151/http://www.fimucite.com/f4/en/# |archive-date=11 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Úbeda]] in Spain,&lt;ref&gt;[http://festival.bsospirit.com/en/index.php ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kraków]] in Poland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmp.org.pl/ |title=Festiwal Muzyki Polskiej |publisher=Fmp.org.pl |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Soundtrack Academy|World Soundtrack Awards]] in [[Ghent]], Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Poland |url=http://filmmusiccritics.org/members/ |title=IFMCA: the International Film Music Critics Association » Members |publisher=Filmmusiccritics.org |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IFMCA Awards==
The organization is responsible for the annual International Film Music Critics Association Awards, the only awards given to composers by active film music journalists, and which are seen by many as a valuable precursor to the [[Academy Awards]] in the absence of a guild for composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://incontention.com/2010/01/29/international-film-music-critics-nominees/ |title=International Film Music Critics nominees |publisher=Incontention.com |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been called the "Oscars of film music",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.es/agencias/noticia.asp?noticia=704788 |title=Araujo, premio IFMCA a la banda sonora de videojuegos por "Lords of Shadow" |publisher=Abc.es |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been featured in major daily newspapers in Spain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Pantallas/Sinfonias/videojuego/elpepurtv/20110308elpepirtv_1/Tes |title=Sinfonías en el videojuego: Premio internacional para Óscar Araujo por una banda sonora |publisher=Elpais.com |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundoportugues.org/content/1/8810/nuno-malo-eleito-compositor-revelacao-ano-nos-estados-unidos/ |title=Nuno Malo eleito o compositor revelação do ano nos Estados Unidos |publisher=Mundoportugues.org |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; are recognized by major performing rights organizations such as [[ASCAP]] in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/playback/2011/02/Faces_Places/FilmTV/IFMCA_Awards.aspx |title=ASCAP Composers Score at the IFMCA Awards |publisher=Ascap.com |date=1 March 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sociedad General de Autores y Editores|SGAE]] in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sgae.es/el-compositor-catalan-oscar-araujo-gana-el-premio-a-la-mejor-banda-sonora-2010-para-videojuego-de-la-international-film-music-critics-association/ |title=SGAE: El compositor catalán Óscar Araujo gana el Premio a la Mejor Banda Sonora 2010 para Videojuego de la International Film Music Critics Association |publisher=Sgae.es |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently have been seen by the video games industry as an important step forward in legitimizing game music as a mainstream creative art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kietzmann |first=Ludwig |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2011/02/12/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-soundtrack-nominated-for-2-ifmca/ |title=Castlevania: Lords of Shadow soundtrack nominated for 2 IFMCA awards |publisher=Joystiq.com |date=12 February 2011 |accessdate=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JourneyContinued.jpg|thumb|First UK edition (publ. [[OUP]])]]

'''''Journey Continued: An Autobiography''''' is the second part of [[Alan Paton]]'s autobiography, the first being ''[[Towards the Mountain]]''.

Paton had completed the writing and correction of the volume, but he died before its publication in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;Journey Continued by Alan Paton, Oxford University Press, 1988, {{ISBN|978-0-19-219237-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics==

The book addresses a wide variety of topics, personal, professional, philosophical, and political. For example, it discusses the way in which Paton's ''[[Cry, The Beloved Country]]'' was adapted for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/02/books/reflections-on-beloved-country.html|date=1988-04-02|access-date=2016-12-12|last=Battersby|first=John D.|title=Reflections On 'Beloved Country'|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it also discusses the Christian basis for Paton's activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-14/books/bk-134_1_alan-paton|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=1990-01-14|title=JOURNEY CONTINUED: An Autobiography by Alan Paton|access-date=2016-12-12|first=Charles|last=Solomon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ngwenya /&gt;

''Journey Continued'' outlines long Paton's and deep involvement with the [[Liberal Party of South Africa]], and his views on [[liberalism]] and its distinctness from other political philosophies.&lt;ref name=ngwenya&gt;{{cite journal|title=The liberal‐Christian vision in Alan Paton's autobiography|journal=Current Writing: Text and Reception in Southern Africa|doi=10.1080/1013929X.1997.9678021|first=Thengani H|last=Ngwenya|volume=9|date=1997|pages=36–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Peace Profile: The African Resistance Movement|first=Travis K.|last=Sharp|pages=455–462|doi=10.1080/10402650500374793|journal=[[Peace Review]]|volume=17|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=

==Quotations==

{{Quote|text="Between communists and liberals ... there is a fundamental incompatibility. ... A liberal cannot accept that the use of any means is justifiable if the end is good; a communist can. A liberal shrinks from the idea of a centrally controlled society, and a centrally controlled economy; a communist does not. The liberal belief in the separation of powers is not acceptable to communists. A liberal believes that a centrally controlled economy kills private initiative and drive, and leads to a drab and dreary existence. A liberal believes in the rule of law, the communist believes in the rule of the party." |author=Alan Paton|source=''Journey Continued''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journey Continued: An Autobiography|last=Paton|first=Alan|isbn=9780192192370|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=68|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

|name=Lego Fabuland
|from=1979
|to=1989
|sets=102
|characters=Edward Elephant&lt;br&gt;Bonnie Bunny&lt;br&gt;Max Mouse&lt;br&gt;Mike Monkey&lt;br&gt;Paulette Poodle

'''Lego Fabuland''' was a theme and product range of the [[Lego]] construction toy, aimed at young children. Introduced in 1979, the range aimed to fill the gap between [[Lego Duplo|Duplo]] and the standard Lego product ranges. Aimed at both boys and girls, the range encouraged storytelling, and was the first theme to be extended into books, clothing, and a [[claymation]] [[Edward and Friends|TV series]] that aired in the UK and Canada during the 1980s as [[Edward and Friends]]. Each episode was five minutes in length.&lt;ref name="The Lego Book" /&gt;

== Characters ==
Fabuland sets featured [[anthropomorphic]] animal characters. These pieces were larger than standard Lego [[Minifigures]], but smaller than Duplo figures, and included movable arms, legs and head. Some of the characters appeared in more than one set, and were given names, and sometimes even stories. Recurring characters included Edward Elephant, Bonnie Bunny, Max Mouse, Clive Crocodile, Walter (Wilfred) Walrus, Wally Walrus, Lucy Lamb, Lisa Lamb, Ricky Raccoon, Roger Raccoon, Freddy Fox, Bruno Bear, Bernard Bear, Billy Bear, Perry Panda, Patrick Panda, Bertie Bulldog, Boris Bulldog, Buster Bulldog, Barty Bulldog, Clarke Bulldog, Mike Monkey, Mark Monkey, Gabriel Gorilla (Chester Chimp), Paulette Poodle, Harry Horse, Henry Horse, Catherine Cat, Charlie Cat, Sandy Seagull, Lionel Lion, Legal Beagle, Hannah Hippopotamus, Joe Crow, Marjorie Mouse, Mortimer Mouse, Michael Mouse, Patricia Piglet, Patrick Pig, Percy Pig, Peter Pig, Hugo Hog, Billy Goat, Gertrude Goat, Clara Cow, Doctor Dog, Paul Parrot, Robby Rabbit, Bert Bear and Ernie Elephant.&lt;ref name="Fabuland 3679" /&gt; This was the first Lego theme which characters had names&lt;ref name="Lego Fabuland history" /&gt;. In different countries names of the same characters were different.

==Style==
Fabuland had a distinctive friendly style with various animal characters that each had a job or purpose in the town of Fabuland. Fabuland featured special elements that were larger than standard Lego bricks, but were fully compatible with regular Lego. Fabuland used a primary colour scheme and the sets were aimed for children between 4-8 as a transition from Duplo to Lego. Fabuland was unique due to the special elements, such as walls, roof elements, tables, chairs, boats and cars chassis. Larger Sets included buildings with story book like instructions and the theme also had many vehicles and individual characters with accessories. Fabuland is highly sought after today among collectors and there is a large fan base that keeps the theme alive via Lego fan sites.

Fabuland was discontinued in 1989 and since then many elements have reappeared in many themes. In 2000, Lego released the [[Lego Mickey Mouse|Mickey Mouse theme]] that contained many Fabuland elements. Fabuland elements have appeared in [[Lego Harry Potter|Harry Potter]], [[Lego Belville|Belville]], [[Lego Castle|Castle]]/Kingdoms, [[Lego Friends|Friends]] and Lego Games and others. The Fabuland line was referenced in the 2014 film ''[[The Lego Movie]]''.

== Books ==

A '''Living National Treasure''' (인간문화재; 人間文化財 ; ingan munhwage, literally, ''human cultural asset'') is a [[South Korea]]n popular term for those individuals certified as '''Holders of [[Intangible Cultural Property (South Korea)|Important Intangible Cultural Properties]]''' (중요무형문화재보유자 ; 重要無形文化財保有者; Jungyomuhyeongmunhwajaeboyuja), also known as ''keepers'', by the [[Ministry of Education (South Korea)|Ministry of Education]] as based on South Korea's Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties (文化財保護法).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx%3D2243%26lang%3Den%26page_type%3Dlist |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531124737/http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=2243&amp;lang=en&amp;page_type=list |archivedate=2014-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=2244&amp;lang=en&amp;page_type=list&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Living National Treasure" is not formally mentioned in the law, but is an informal term referencing the cultural properties designated as the [[National Treasure (South Korea)|National Treasures]].

== History ==
The government started taking steps after the Second World War and the Korean War to protect the intangible heritage of the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=2244&amp;lang=en&amp;page_type=list&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined in 1960 by the young reporter Ye Yong-hae, who published a number of series in the ''[[Hankook Ilbo]]'' newspaper, highlighting the plight of artisans and artists who were either neglected or even persecuted under the regime of President Park under the ''[[Misin tapa undong]]'' modernization drive that was destroying the old traditional beliefs and fabrics of villages. In a growing recognition of the worthiness of protecting the old Korean traditions and culture, a law was passed to protect the intangible cultural heritage and the masters and artisans who were keeping it alive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=2244&amp;lang=en&amp;page_type=list&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time the number of keepers of this heritage grew, but the list was also subject to criticism about the exact criteria and nomination process.

The latest Important Intangible Cultural Property is ''bun-wa-jang'', a traditional Korean roof building skill, which was designated in 2008. With the designation, Lee Geon-bok was approved as an ''ingan-munhwage'' in 2008. According to [[Jeon Byung-hon]] of the [[Democratic Party (South Korea, 2008)|Democratic Party]], twelve Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea have not had any ''ingan-munhwage'' for more than 10 years.

== Definition ==
A Living National Treasure is a person with the ability to make or perform one of the officially designated Important [[Intangible Cultural Property (South Korea)|Intangible Cultural Properties]].  Intangible culture assets are organized within 108 different aspects of Korean traditional culture, from traditional dance to building techniques. The ministry draws the list and puts the artist under its protection. It is advised by the [[Cultural Heritage Administration]] under the Cultural Properties Protection Law. Once people are designated as an holders, they have rights to government support for transmission of their cultural performance and have responsibility to show that ability and train younger students. The designation expires with his or her death.

== List ==
Presently it has designated a total of 570 holders of these intangible properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx%3D2243%26lang%3Den%26page_type%3Dlist |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531124737/http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=2243&amp;lang=en&amp;page_type=list |archivedate=2014-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ministry''' is an American [[industrial metal]] band founded in 1981 by [[Al Jourgensen]] in [[Chicago]], Illinois. Originally a [[synth-pop]] outfit, Ministry shifted its style to become one of the pioneers of industrial metal in the late 1980s. The band's lineup has gone through many changes throughout its history, with Jourgensen remaining the only constant as the band's main producer, singer, songwriter, and instrumentalist.{{sfn|Brooks|2017|p=49}} Notable musicians who have contributed to the band's studio or live activities include [[Paul Barker]], [[Martin Atkins]], [[Bill Rieflin]], [[Chris Connelly (musician)|Chris Connelly]], [[Nivek Ogre]], [[Mike Scaccia]], [[Rey Washam]], [[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]], [[Tommy Victor]], [[John Bechdel]], [[Jason Christopher]], [[Tony Campos]], [[Burton C. Bell]] and [[DJ Swamp]].

Ministry found mainstream success in the late 1980s and early 1990s with three of their studio albums: ''[[The Land of Rape and Honey]]'' (1988), ''[[The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste]]'' (1989) and ''[[Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and the Way to Suck Eggs|Psalm 69]]'' (1992), with the former of the two certified gold and the latter certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&amp;ar=Ministry&amp;ti=&amp;lab=&amp;genre=&amp;format=&amp;date_option=release&amp;from=&amp;to=&amp;award=&amp;type=&amp;category=&amp;adv=SEARCH#search_section|title=Gold &amp; Platinum – RIAA |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA.com]] |accessdate=September 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1996 follow-up album, ''[[Filth Pig]]'', was also critically acclaimed but did not repeat the success of its predecessors; the album did, however, earn Ministry its highest chart position on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at number nineteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry – Chart history|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/ministry|work=Billboard|accessdate=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band has been nominated for six [[Grammy Award]]s, and performed at several notable music festivals, including participating in the second annual [[Lollapalooza]] tour in 1992 and co-headlining [[Big Day Out]] in 1995.

Ministry was dissolved in 2008 after 27 years of recording and performing, and Jourgensen had since stated that they would never reunite. However, the band announced a reunion in August 2011,&lt;ref name="reunion"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=161658 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120605021629/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=161658 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=June 5, 2012 |title=Ministry Is Back! 2012 Wacken Open Air Festival Appearance Confirmed |publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=August 7, 2011 |accessdate=August 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has released three more studio albums since then: ''[[Relapse (Ministry album)|Relapse]]'' (2012), ''[[From Beer to Eternity]]'' (2013) and ''[[AmeriKKKant]]'' (2018).

==History==

===Formation and early days (1981–1982)===
Ministry's origins date to 1978, when Al Jourgensen relocated from [[Denver]] to [[Chicago]], in order to study in [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois]]. Jourgensen was introduced to the local underground scene by his then-girlfriend Shannon Rose Riley, and soon after joined as guitarist to a post-punk/new wave band [[Special Affect]], replacing Tom Hoffman on guitar and accompanying to vocalist Frank Nardiello ([[Groovie Mann]] of [[My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult]]), drummer Harry Rushakoff ([[Concrete Blonde]]) and bassist Marty Sorenson.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thompson|2000|p=497}}; {{harvnb|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|pp=45–46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nothing Exceeds Like Excess"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Wolanski |first=Coreen |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/ministry-nothing_exceeds_like_excess|title=Ministry – Nothing Exceeds Like Excess|work=[[Exclaim!]]|date=March 1, 2003 |accessdate=December 4, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Revolver TracRec"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Angle |first=Brad |date=December 1, 2007 |title=Ministry: Track Record |url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/ministry-track-record |magazine=[[Revolver Magazine]] |access-date=December 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Special Affect's split, Jourgensen formed The Carmichaels, the short-lived band which featured Ben Krug, Tom Krug and Tom Wall (all of [[The Imports]]), and did two shows, including the one performed on April 30, 1981 with a local experimental band ONO as an opening act.&lt;ref name="Prongs_Krug"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prongs.org/ministry/Krug1 |title=Interview with Ben Krug regarding the Silly Charmichaels |work=Prongs.org |date=March 18, 2006 |accessdate=March 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|p=47}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2016/11/12/hyde-park-postpunks-the-imports-couldve-been-americas-joy-division|title=Hyde Park postpunks the Imports could've been America's Joy Division {{!}} Bleader|last=Krakow|first=Steve|date=December 11, 2016|website=[[Chicago Reader]]|access-date=September 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ONO Unabridged"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thecompmagazine.com/ono/ |title=ONO – An Unabridged History In Conversation |last=Alamo-Costello |first=Chester |date=August 7, 2016 |website=The COMP Magazine |access-date=December 4, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this time Jourgensen had also met Jim Nash and Danny Flesher, co-founders and co-owners of the indie record label [[Wax Trax! Records]] who recommended him as a touring guitarist for [[Divine (performer)|Divine]].{{sfn|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|pp=47–48}} After playing a few concerts with the latter, Jourgensen—then living within an [[African-American neighborhood]]—had begun to write and record the songs in his apartment, using a newly-bought [[ARP Omni]] synthesizer, a drum machine, and a reel-to-reel tape recorder.&lt;ref name="Ordained by Dance"/&gt; At one point, he had presented a demo to Jim Nash, who had favored it and offered Jourgensen to record a single, as well as to form a touring band, certainly titled Ministry.{{efn|In an article published in the September 1982 issue of ''Illinois Entertainer'', Jourgensen was said to discuss several possible names for the band (including “Fallen Pillar”, “Ministry of Fear” and “Ministry of Funk”), before settling on Ministry as it combined “the doom / gloom chromosomes of Fear and the dance feel of Funk.”&lt;ref name="Ordained by Dance"/&gt; Much later, in a reference book ''Rock Names'', an author Adam Dolgins wrote that the band's name was initially coined by Jourgensen as the reference to [[Fritz Lang]]’s 1944 movie ''[[Ministry of Fear]]'';&lt;ref name="RockNames"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rock Names: From ABBA to ZZ Top: How Rock Bands Got Their Names|last=Dolgins|first=Adam|publisher=Carol Pub.

Some people interpret it religiously... To a lot of people I’m the Ministry of Assholes and others think I’m the Ministry of whatever. The whole point being that the name conjures up the image of a big omnipotent corporation behind closed doors, in darkened rooms, wheeling and dealing, powerplay type of thing. So to some people the name is along government lines and to others it’s along religious lines, but when it all boils down to it what’s the fucking difference. Power brokers is all that it is, behind closed doors, running your lives. And that’s what it’s supposed to conjure up and that’s what I wanted to generate and that’s what it will always be within Ministry.&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Ordained by Dance"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Baker |first=Cary |date=September 1982 |title=Ministry: Ordained by Dance |format=transcription|url=http://prongs.org/ministry/illinois_entertainer-82 |magazine=Illinois Entertainer |volume=2 |issue=103 |access-date=September 12, 2018|via=''Prongs.org'' archive|postscript=.

The first line-up of Ministry, the five-piece band assembled by Jourgensen in November 1981, consisted of keyboardists Robert Roberts and John Davis, bassist Sorenson, and drummer [[Stephen George]]; Jourgensen claimed he didn't want to perform vocals, but embarked on after he had auditioned several singers “who all sucked.”&lt;ref name="Prongs Rob. Roberts"/&gt;{{sfn|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|p=49}} Nash had paid sessions at Hedden West studios, where the band's debut record, a twelve-inch single featuring “I’m Falling” and instrumental track “Primental” on the A-side, with the song “[[Cold Life]]” on the B-side,{{efn|According to Jello Biafra, it was intended to be a seven-inch single featuring the song “Overkill” with the B-side “I’m Falling”.{{sfn|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|p=104}}}} was recorded with co-producers Jay O’Roarke and [[Iain Burgess]] and released in late 1981 on Wax Trax! in the US.&lt;ref name="Ordained by Dance" /&gt;{{sfn|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|p=50}} In March 1982, the single was licensed by British label [[Situation Two]], with “Cold Life” as the A-side.&lt;ref name="Gimarc250"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Post Punk Diary, 1980–1982|last=Gimarc|first=George|publisher=St.Martin's Griffin|year=1997|isbn=031216968X|location=New York|pages=250|via=the Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greene|1993|p=26}}; {{harvnb|Fontenoy|1999|p=645}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ministry had performed their debut concert on the New Year Eve of 1982 in Chicago-based club Misfits,&lt;ref name="Ordained by Dance" /&gt; and, in that year’s Spring, commenced a tour of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], supporting on occasions for English bands [[Medium Medium]], [[A Flock of Seagulls]], [[Culture Club]], and [[Depeche Mode]].&lt;ref name="Prongs Rob.

Around this time, the band drew the attention of the [[Arista Records]] founder and head [[Clive Davis]], who offered the band a deal, promising to make them “the next [[Joy Division]]”—a claim that Jourgensen later viewed as false.&lt;ref name="Ordained by Dance" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glickman|1994|p=164}}; {{harvnb|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UCR WS"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/ministry-with-sympathy/|title=35 Year Ago: Ministry Release Disavowed Debut, 'With Sympathy'|last=Zaleski|first=Annie|date=May 10, 2018|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|publisher=[[Townsquare Media]]|access-date=June 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signing a six-figure, two-album deal, the band—with Jourgensen and George comprising the official line-up&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Rock’N’Roll|last=Coupe|first=Stuart|last2=Baker|first2=Glenn A.|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=1983|isbn=0312572107|location=New York|pages=103–104|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AllMusic Bio"/&gt;{{sfn|Brooks|2017|p=48}}—moved to record at the Synchro Sound studios in Boston, with producers Vince Ely (former drummer of [[Psychedelic Furs]]) and Ian Taylor (former acquaintance of [[Roy Thomas Baker]]).&lt;ref name="Ministry of Offence"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Sweeting |first=Adam |date=July 10, 1982 |title=Ministry of Offence |format=scan|url=http://www.prongs.org/minfiles/mags/melody_maker/melody-maker-july-10-1982.jpg |magazine=[[Melody Maker]] |issn=0025-9012 |access-date=February 5, 2018 |postscript=.

On release, the album was supported by two more singles—“Revenge” (of which the music video was reworked from “Same Old Madness”) and “[[I Wanted to Tell Her]]” (a reworked version of “Primental”)—and the concert tour during which Ministry was very well received by the large stadium audiences, as they supported for [[The Police]] during North American leg of their ''[[Synchronicity (The Police album)|Synchronicity]]'' tour.&lt;ref name="Prongs Rob.

In spite of ''With Sympathy'''s considerable success, Jourgensen's relations with Arista were acrimonious, due to Jourgensen's dissatisfaction upon his treatment as a commercial pop artist. Eventually, Jourgensen sent a demo tape featuring a cover version of [[Roxy Music]] song “[[Same Old Scene]]” before parting ways with Arista, suing the latter for taking advantage of him and his band, and thus violating a contractual obligations by their side.&lt;ref name="Al and his CoP"&gt;{{Cite magazine|last=Blush|first=Steven|date=October 1991|title=Cult of Personality|url=https://books.google.ru/books?id=yGjqAHJs488C&amp;pg=PT85|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin Magazine]]|volume=7|issue=7|pages=77–78|doi=|issn=0886-3032|pmid=|access-date=February 23, 2018|postscript=.

Ministry would later perform the song in a cameo appearance in the Steven Spielberg film ''[[AI: Artificial Intelligence]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1444871/steven-spielberg-nabs-ministry-for-ai-flesh-fair/|title=Steven Spielberg Nabs Ministry for A.I.|work=MTV|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years 2000–2002, disputes with Warner Bros. Records resulted in the planned albums ''Live Psalm 69'', ''Sphinctour'' and ''ClittourUS'' on [[Ipecac Recordings]] being canceled.&lt;ref name="Live on Ipecac"/&gt; ''Sphinctour'' was released on [[Sanctuary Records]].&lt;ref name="AllMusic Bio"/&gt;

Around 2001, Jourgensen almost lost his arm when he was bitten by a venomous spider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/jourgensens%20heroin%20wake-up%20call |title=Ministry – Jourgensen's Heroin Wake-Up Call|work=Contactmusic.com|df=mdy-all|date=November 8, 2005|accessdate=March 16, 2011|postscript=.

The sound was strongly heavy metal laden with voice effects, and matched the ferocity of ''Psalm 69'' (though it featured an almost-pop cover of [[Magazine (band)|Magazine]]'s "The Light Pours Out Of Me"). ''Animositisomina'', compared to previous releases, sold poorly and singles for "Animosity" and "Piss" were canceled before they could be released.

Barker announced his departure from Ministry in January 2004. He stated that the trigger was his father dying while the band was wrapping up a summer tour in Europe, and also stated that his family life was his main focus at that particular time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1484541/founding-bassist-paul-barker-leaves-ministry/|title=Founding Bassist Paul Barker Leaves Ministry|last1=Wiederhorn|first1=Jon|date=January 22, 2004|website=MTV News|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jourgensen's second wife Angelina Lukacen stated in 2013 that he fell out with Barker over the band's finances.{{sfn|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|pp=213–215}} Jourgensen continued Ministry with Mike Scaccia and various other musicians.

===''Houses of the Molé'' and ''Rio Grande Blood'' (2004–2006)===
[[File:Ministry, Mera Luna 2006.JPG|thumb|Ministry performing live at the 2006 [[M'era Luna Festival]] ([[Hildesheim]], Germany)]]
For Ministry's next album, Jourgensen released the song "[[No W]]", a song critical of then-U.S. President [[George W. Bush]]; an alternate version of the track was placed on the multi-performer compilation ''[[Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1]]''. The follow-up LP, ''[[Houses of the Molé]]'' (2004), contained the most explicitly political lyrics Jourgensen had yet written, with songs in Ministry's classic [[Industrial music|industrial]] electro-metallic sound played messier, more crudely and more freely than ever before, giving the album the most metal-oriented sound of their career. In 2006 the band released ''[[Rio Grande Blood]]'', an LP on Jourgensen's own [[13th Planet Records]]. With [[Prong (band)|Prong]]'s [[Tommy Victor]] and [[Killing Joke]]'s [[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]], the album featured an even heavier thrash metal sound drawing comparison to [[Slayer]]. 
The single "Lieslieslies" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]] at the 49th annual Grammy Awards. It, along with another song on the album, "The Great Satan", is also available as a [[downloadable content]] song for the 2008 video game [[Rock Band 2|''Rock Band 2'']]. In July 2007, the band released ''[[Rio Grande Dub]]'', an album featuring remixes from the band's 2006 ''[[Rio Grande Blood]]'' album.

===''The Last Sucker'', ''Cover Up'' and ''Undercover'' (2007–2010)===
Ministry's "final" album,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58299/ministry-plots-final-disc|work=Billboard|first=Gary|last=Graff|author-link=Gary Graff|title=Ministry Plots Final Disc|date=May 26, 2006|accessdate=February 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Last Sucker]]'', was released on September 18, 2007.

On June 4, 2007, Al Jourgensen filed a [[Tortious interference|Tortious Interference]] lawsuit against Paul Barker and Spurburn Music in Los Angeles Superior Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lasuperiorcourt.org/CivilCaseSummary/main.asp?Referer=Index |title=Los Angeles Superior Court – Civil Case Summary |publisher=Lasuperiorcourt.org |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415075207/http://www.lasuperiorcourt.org/civilCaseSummary/main.asp?referer=index |archivedate=April 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (case #SC094122) The case was dismissed on October 24, 2008.

[[Paul Raven (musician)|Paul Raven]] died on October 20, 2007, a month and two-day after the release of ''The Last Sucker''. He suffered an apparent heart attack shortly after arriving in Europe to commence recording for the French industrial band [[Treponem Pal]] near the Swiss border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=26593_0_2_0_C |title=Paul Raven – Bass player with Killing Joke, Ministry, Prong Dies in Geneva Aged 46 (Jan 16th 1961) |publisher=Side-line.com |date= |accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jourgensen|Wiederhorn|2013|p=251}}

Al Jourgensen remixed and co-produced Spyder Baby's "Bitter", which was released by Blind Prophecy Records in early 2008.

A song titled "[[Keys to the City (song)|Keys to the City]]", the theme song for the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] was released on March 5, 2008. In addition to this single, two albums of covers/remixes, ''[[Cover Up (Ministry album)|Cover Up]]'' (April 1, 2008) and ''[[Undercover (Ministry album)|Undercover]]'' (December 7, 2010) were released. All of these releases are credited to '''Ministry and Co-Conspirators''', since they feature [[collaboration]]s between Al Jourgensen and other musicians.

Ministry's "farewell" tour, the "C-U-LaTour", started its North American leg on March 26, 2008 with [[Meshuggah]] performing as special guests and [[Hemlock (band)|Hemlock]] as an opening act. They played their final North American shows in Chicago on May 10 and 12, 2008.&lt;ref name="Overdue NotDemise"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://music.avclub.com/the-overdue-demise-of-ministry-1798214003|title=The Overdue Demise of Ministry|last=Ryan|first=Kyle|date=May 13, 2008|work=[[The A.V.

During the performance, Jourgensen repeatedly reaffirmed it would indeed be the last ever Ministry show. Due to a large demand for tickets, an extra gig was added at the Tripod on July 19, 2008. The band again played to a full house. Ministry's final song at this show (and ostensibly their last ever live performance) was a rendition of their cover version of "[[What a Wonderful World]]".&lt;ref name="PopMatters_Ministry in Dublin 18.07.12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/161320-ministry-18-july-2012-dublin-ireland-2495829574.html|title=Ministry: 18 July 2012–Dublin, Ireland|last=Brown|first=Dean|date=August 2, 2012|website=[[PopMatters]]|access-date=April 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Adios... Puta Madres]]'', a live album featuring material culled from Ministry's final tour, was released in 2009 on CD and DVD.&lt;ref name="Al Jourgensen: Sex-O Olympic-O"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Al+Jourgensen%3A+Sex-O+Olympic-O/|title = Al Jourgensen: Sex-O Olympic-O |publisher = [[SuicideGirls.com]] |date = March 12, 2009 |accessdate = March 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[documentary film]] called ''[[Fix: The Ministry Movie]]'' was planned for release sometime in 2010. However, the release date was pushed back to early 2011. The documentary premiered at the Chicago International Movies &amp; Music Festival. Jourgensen sued the maker, Doug Freel, for failing to fulfill his part of the contract (giving Jourgensen approval over the final cut, along with "thousands of dollars").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Gina |last=McIntyre |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2011/04/ministry-frontman-al-jourgensen-sues-makers-of-behind-the-scenes-documentary-fix-.html |title=Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen sues makers of behind-the-scenes documentary 'Fix' |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=April 20, 2011 |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lawsuit was dropped in July 2011. On July 21, the film was screened privately at the Music Box Theater in Los Angeles.

===Reunion, ''Relapse'' and death of Mike Scaccia (2011–2012)===
On August 7, 2011, Ministry announced they would reform and would play at Germany's [[Wacken Open Air]] festival, set to take place August 2–4, 2012.&lt;ref name="reunion"/&gt; The reunion lineup featured [[Al Jourgensen]] on vocals, [[Mike Scaccia]] and [[Tommy Victor]] on guitar, [[Aaron Rossi]] on drums, [[John Bechdel]] on keyboards, and [[Tony Campos]] on bass.&lt;ref name="MetHammer Aug'11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/ministry-world-exclusive/|title=Ministry World Exclusive!|last=Gill|first=James|date=August 18, 2011|website=[[Metal Hammer]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827023711/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/ministry-world-exclusive/|archive-date=August 27, 2011|dead-url=yes|access-date=November 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blabbermouth on Jourgensen interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/al-jourgensen-why-i-decided-to-bring-back-ministry/ |title=Al Jourgensen: Why I Decided To Bring Back Ministry |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=August 18, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jourgensen told ''Metal Hammer'' in August 2011 that Ministry was working on a new album called ''[[Relapse (Ministry album)|Relapse]]'', which they hoped to release by Christmas. Regarding the sound of the new material, he explained, "We've only got five songs to go. I've been listening to it the last couple of weeks and I wasn't really in the mood, I was just taking it as a joke. Just to pass the time at first but [Mikey's] raving about it. It's like, dude c'mon, this is not about Bush, so… that part's over. The ulcers are gone and Bush is gone so it's time for something new. I think this is actually gonna wind up being the fastest and heaviest record I've ever done. Just because we did it as anti-therapy therapy against the country music we would just take days off and thrash faster than I've done in a long time, faster than Mikey's done in a long time. He just did a [[Rigor Mortis (band)|Rigor Mortis]] tour and said it was easy compared to this Ministry stuff so it's gonna be brutal and it's gonna freak a lot of people out."&lt;ref name="MetHammer Aug'11"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blabbermouth on Jourgensen interview"/&gt;

Ministry announced on their website that they entered the studio on September 1, 2011 with engineer Sammy D'Ambruoso to begin recording their new album.&lt;ref name="reunion"/&gt; During the third webisode featuring behind-the-scenes footage from the making of ''Relapse'', a release date of March 3, 2012 was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=166136 |title=Ministry: The Making Of 'Relapse' Webisode 3 |work=Blabbermouth.net |accessdate=November 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117000813/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=166136 |archivedate=November 17, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 2011, Ministry released "[[99 Percenters]]", the first single from ''Relapse'', and began streaming it on their Facebook page two days later. On February 22, 2012, Ministry released a second single, "[[Double Tap (Ministry song)|Double Tap]]", which was included in the April 2012 issue of the ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' magazine. On March 23, 2012, ''Relapse'' was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Ministry&amp;titel=Relapse&amp;cat=a |title=Ministry – Relapse |publisher=austriancharts.at |date= |accessdate=December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 23, 2012, guitarist Mike Scaccia died&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ministry-guitarist-mike-scaccia-dies-after-onstage-collapse-20121223 | title=Ministry Guitarist Mike Scaccia Dies After Onstage Collapse | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=December 23, 2012 | accessdate=December 23, 2012 | author=Prato, Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt; following an on-stage heart attack, while playing with his other band, Rigor Mortis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=184021 | title=MIKE SCACCIA: Official Cause Of Death Revealed; Benefit Concert Planned | work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] | date=December 24, 2012 | accessdate=December 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--I think it has to be under "From Beer to Eternity" section--&gt;

===''From Beer to Eternity'', ''AmeriKKKant'' and next album (2013–present)===
In an interview with ''Noisey'' in March 2013, Jourgensen announced that Ministry would break up again, explaining that he did not want to carry on without Scaccia. He explained, "Mikey was my best friend in the world and there's no Ministry without him. But I know the music we recorded together during the last weeks of his life had to be released to honor him. So after his funeral, I locked myself in my studio and turned the songs we had recorded into the best and last Ministry record anyone will ever hear. I can't do it without Mikey and I don't want to. So yes, this will be Ministry's last album."&lt;ref name="ultimate-guitar"&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Jourgensen Announces the End of Ministry|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/al_jourgensen_announces_the_end_of_ministry.html|publisher=Ultimate Guitar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album, titled ''[[From Beer to Eternity]]'', was released on September 6, 2013.

When asked in July 2016 whether Ministry was going to release another album after ''From Beer to Eternity'', Jourgensen stated, "When I was asked, it was after Mikey passed and the entire media immediately starts asking me what is going to happen to Ministry. He wasn't even buried yet. I thought, 'Fuck you.' I was really pissed and really angry. I said, 'Fuck Ministry and fuck you for asking.' They want to comment on Ministry when my best friend had died. It's been more than two years now, and I got more ideas and I have done albums with Mikey and have done them without him. It's time to get another record out. I have a bunch of songs written in my head. I wanted to have time to mourn before people start asking me about touring dates. It was sick. I was bombarded and email boxes were overloaded with 'what are you going to do now?' It was kind of creepy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theprp.com/2016/07/13/news/al-jourgensen-planning-new-ministry-album-slams-republicans-trump-supporters/ |title=Al Jourgensen Planning New Ministry Album, Slams Republicans &amp; Trump Supporters |website=theprp.com |date=July 13, 2016 |accessdate=July 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2018 interview with ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, Jourgensen revealed that he has begun working on new material for Ministry's fifteenth studio album.

'''''The Miracle of the Slave''''' (also known as '''''The Miracle of St. Mark''''', 1548) is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Jacopo Tintoretto]].  Currently housed in the [[Gallerie dell'Accademia]] in [[Venice]], northern Italy, it was originally commissioned for the [[Scuola Grande di San Marco]], a confraternity in the city.

It portrays an episode of the life of [[Saint Mark]], patron saint of Venice, taken from [[Jacopo da Varazze]]'s ''[[Golden Legend]]''. The scene shows, in the upper part, the saint intervening to make invulnerable a slave about to be martyred for his veneration of another saint's relics. All the figures are inscribed into an architectonic scenario.

Different influences on Tintoretto's art can be seen in the picture: while the anatomies are [[Michelangelo]]-like, the vivid and intense colors are typical of the [[Venetian School (art)|Venetian School]].

[[File:Mansurtulip.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Ustad Mansur]] (fl.&amp;nbsp;1590-1624), who came to prominence during the reign of Jahangir]]
'''Mughal painting''' is that particular style of South Asian painting which generally confines  [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] either as book illustrations or as single works to be kept in albums, which emerged from [[Persian miniature]] painting (itself largely of [[Chinese painting|Chinese origin]]), with Indian Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist influences, and developed largely in the court of the [[Mughal Empire]] of the 16th to 18th centuries. 

Mughal paintings later spread to other Indian courts, both Muslim and Hindu, and later Sikh. The mingling of foreign Persian and indigenous Indian elements was a continuation of the patronisation of other aspects of foreign culture as initiated by the earlier Turko-Afghan [[Delhi Sultanate]], and the introduction of it into the subcontinent by various Central Asian Turkic dynasties, such as the [[Ghaznavids]].

==Origins==
This art of painting developed as a blending of Persian and Indian ideas. There was already a Muslim tradition of miniature painting under the Turko-Afghan Sultanate of Delhi which the Mughals overthrew, and like the Mughals, and the very earliest of Central Asian invaders into the subcontinent, patronized foreign culture. Although the first surviving manuscripts are from [[Mandu, Madhya Pradesh|Mandu]] in the years either side of 1500, there were very likely earlier ones which are either lost, or perhaps now attributed to southern Persia, as later manuscripts can be hard to distinguish from these by style alone, and some remain the subject of debate among specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 161-166&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of the Mughal invasion, the tradition had abandoned the high viewpoint typical of the Persian style, and adopted a more realistic style for animals and plants.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 161&lt;/ref&gt;

No miniatures survive from the reign of the founder of the dynasty, [[Babur]], nor does he mention commissioning any in his diaries, the ''[[Baburnama]]''.  Copies of this were illustrated by his descendents, Akbar in particular, with many portraits of the many new animals Babur encountered when he invaded India, which are carefully described.&lt;ref&gt;Titley, 187&lt;/ref&gt;  However some surviving un-illustrated manuscripts may have been commissioned by him, and he comments on the style of some famous past Persian masters.  Some older illustrated manuscripts have his seal on them; the Mughals came from a long line stretching back to [[Timur]] and were fully assimilated into [[Persianate]] culture, and expected to patronize literature and the arts.

Mughal painting immediately took a much greater interest in realistic portraiture than was typical of Persian miniatures.  Animals and plants were also more realistically shown.  Although many classic works of [[Persian literature]] continued to be illustrated, as well as Indian works, the taste of the Mughal emperors for writing memoirs or diaries, begun by Babur, provided some of the most lavishly decorated texts, such as the [[Padshahnama]] genre of official histories.  Subjects are rich in variety and include portraits, events and scenes from court life, wild life and hunting scenes, and illustrations of battles.  The Persian tradition of richly decorated borders framing the central image was continued.

The style of the Mughal school developed within the royal [[atelier]]. Knowledge was primarily transmitted through familial and apprenticeship relationships, and the system of joint manuscript production which brought multiple artists together for single works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sensiblereason.com/artistic-stylistic-transmission-in-the-royal-mughal-atelier/|title=Artistic Stylistic Transmission in the Royal Mughal Atelier|first=Greg|last=Sarafan|date=6 November 2011|publisher=Sensible Reason}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the second Mughal emperor, [[Humayun]] was in exile in [[Tabriz]] in the [[Safavid]] court of [[Shah Tahmasp I]] of Persia, he was exposed to Persian miniature painting, and commissioned at least one work there, an unusually large painting of ''Princes of the House of Timur'', now in the [[British Museum]].  When Humayun returned to India, he brought two accomplished Persian artists [[Abd al-Samad]] and [[Mir Sayyid Ali]] with him.  His usurping brother [[Kamran Mirza]] had maintained a workshop in [[Kabul]], which Humayan perhaps took over into his own.  Humayan's major known commission was a ''[[Khamsa of Nizami]]'' with 36 illuminated pages, in which the different styles of the various artists are mostly still apparent.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the London painting, he also commissioned at least two miniatures showing himself with family members,&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; a type of subject that was rare in Persia but was to be common among the Mughals.&lt;ref&gt;Beach, 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Mughal painting developed and flourished during the reigns of [[Akbar]], [[Jahangir]] and [[Shah Jahan]].

===Akbar (1556-1605)===
During the reign of Humayun's son [[Akbar]] (r.&amp;nbsp;1556-1605), the imperial court, apart from being the centre of administrative authority to manage and rule the vast Mughal empire, also emerged as a centre of cultural excellence. Akbar inherited and expanded his father's library and atelier of court painters, and paid close personal attention to its output. He had studied painting in his youth under [[Abd as-Samad]], though it is not clear how far these studies went.&lt;ref&gt;Beach, 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1560 and 1566 the ''[[Tutinama]]'' ("Tales of a Parrot"), now in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] was illustrated, showing "the stylistic components of the imperial Mughal style at a formative stage".&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among other manuscripts, between 1562 and 1577 the atelier worked on an illustrated manuscript of the ''[[Hamzanama]]'' consisting of 1,400 canvas [[Bookbinding|folio]]s. [[Saadi (poet)|Sa'di]]'s masterpiece The ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'' was produced at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] in 1582, a ''[[Darab Nama]]'' around 1585; the [[Khamsa of Nizami (British Library, Or. 12208)]] followed in the 1590s and [[Jami]]'s ''Baharistan'' around 1595 in [[Lahore]]. As Mughal-derived painting spread to [[Hindu]] courts the texts illustrated included the Hindu [[Epic poetry|epic]]s including the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]]; themes with animal fables; individual portraits; and paintings on scores of different themes.  Mughal style during this period continued to refine itself with elements of realism and naturalism coming to the fore. Between the years of 1570 to 1585 Akbar hired over a one hundred painters to practice Mughal style painting.&lt;ref&gt;Eastman&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jahangir (1605–25)===
[[Jahangir]] had an artistic inclination and during his reign Mughal painting developed further.  Brushwork became finer and the colors lighter. Jahangir was also deeply influenced by European painting. During his reign he came into direct contact with the English Crown and was sent gifts of oil paintings, which included portraits of the King and Queen. He encouraged his royal atelier to take up the single point perspective favoured by European artists, unlike the flattened multi-layered style used in traditional miniatures. He particularly encouraged paintings depicting events of his own life, individual portraits, and studies of birds, flowers and animals. The ''[[Jahangirnama]]'', written during his lifetime, which is an autobiographical account of Jahangir's reign, has several paintings, including some unusual subjects such as the union of a saint with a tigress, and fights between spiders.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;!-- possible, Thackston 1999 p. xvii says it included a painting between a snake and a spider Lionel Messi The Best Of All Time --&gt;

===Shah Jahan (1628–59)===
During the reign of [[Shah Jahan]] (1628–58), Mughal paintings continued to develop, but court paintings became more rigid and formal. The illustrations from the "Padshanama" (chronicle of the King of the world), one of the finest Islamic manuscripts from the Royal Collection, at Windsor, were painted during the reign of Shah Jahan. Written in Persian on paper that is flecked with gold, has exquisitely rendered paintings. The "Padshahnama" has portraits of the courtiers and servants of the King painted with great detail and individuality. In keeping with the strict formality at court, however the portraits of the King and important nobles was rendered in strict profile, whereas servants and common people, depicted with individual features have been portrayed in the three -quarter view or the frontal view. 
Themes including musical parties; lovers, sometimes in intimate positions, on terraces and gardens; and ascetics gathered around a fire, abound in the Mughal paintings of this period.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Later paintings==
[[Aurangzeb]] (1658-1707) did not actively encourage Mughal paintings, but as this art form had gathered momentum and had a number of patrons, Mughal paintings continued to survive, but the decline had set in.  Some sources however note that a few of the best Mughal paintings were made for Aurangzeb, speculating that they believed that he was about to close the workshops and thus exceeded themselves in his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1600_1699/aurangzeb/darbarscene/darbarscene.html Commentary]  by [[Stuart Cary Welch]]&lt;/ref&gt;  There was a brief revival during the reign of [[Muhammad Shah]] 'Rangeela' (1719–48), but by the time of [[Shah Alam II]] (1759–1806), the art of Mughal painting had lost its glory. By that time, other schools of Indian painting had developed, including, in the royal courts of the Rajput kingdoms of [[Rajputana]], [[Rajput painting]] and in the cities ruled by the [[British East India Company]], the [[Company style]] under Western influence.  Late Mughal style often shows increased use of [[graphical perspective|perspective]] and recession under Western influence.

==Artists==

[[File:Darbarscene.jpg|thumb|280px|A [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] scene with the newly crowned Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in his golden throne. Though he did not encourage Mughal painting, some of the best work was done during in his reign.]]

The Persian master artists [[Abd al-Samad]] and [[Mir Sayyid Ali]], who had accompanied [[Humayun]] to India in the 16th century, were in charge of the imperial atelier during the formative stages of Mughal painting.  Many artists worked on large commissions, the majority of them apparently Hindu, to judge by the names recorded.  Mughal painting flourished during the late 16th and early 17th centuries with spectacular works of art by master artists such as [[Basawan]], Lal, [[Daswanth]],&lt;ref&gt;Diamind, Maurice. [http://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257529.pdf.bannered.pdf "Mughal Painting Under Akbar the Great"] Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Miskin (Mughal painter)|Miskin]]. Another influence on the evolution of style during Akbar's reign was [[Kesu Das]], who understood and developed "European techniques of rendering space and volume".&lt;ref name="BloomBlair2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bloom|first1=Jonathan M.|last2=Blair|first2=Sheila S.|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=un4WcfEASZwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA380|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530991-1|volume=1|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Govardhan (Mughal painter)|Govardhan]] was a noted painter during the reigns of Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan.

The sub-imperial school of Mughal painting included artists such as [[Mushfiq]], Kamal, and Fazl.

During the first half of the 18th century, many Mughal-trained artists left the imperial workshop to work at Rajput courts. These include artists such as Bhawanidas and his son [[Dalchand]].

Mughal painting generally involved a group of artists, one to decide the composition, the second to actually paint, and the third to focus on portraiture, executing individual faces.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mughal style today==
Mughal-style miniature paintings are still being created today by a small number of artists in Lahore concentrated mainly in the National College of Arts. Although many of these miniatures are skillful copies of the originals, some artists have produced contemporary works using classic methods with, at times, remarkable artistic effect.

The skills needed to produce these modern versions of Mughal miniatures are still passed on from generation to generation, although many artisans also employ dozens of workers, often painting under trying working conditions, to produce works sold under the signature of their modern masters.

A '''music library''' contains music-related materials for [[patron use]].  Collections may also include non-print materials, such as digitized music scores or [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio recording]]s.  Use of such materials may be limited to specific patron groups, especially in private academic institutions.  Music library print collections include dictionaries and encyclopedias, indexes and directories, [[Sheet music|printed music]], music serials, bibliographies, and other music literature.

==Types==
Traditionally, there are four types of '''music libraries''':

#Those developed to support departments of music in university or college settings;
#Those developed to support conservatories and schools of music;
#Those housed within public libraries;
#Those developed as independent libraries or archives supporting music organizations.

[[File:Mammals 02995 Thibetian Musk (22899919524).jpg|thumb|262x262px|Musk Deer of Tibet in old illustration]]
'''Musk''' is a class of aromatic substances commonly used as [[base note]]s in [[perfume]]ry. They include [[gland]]ular secretions from animals such as the [[musk deer]], numerous plants emitting similar fragrances, and artificial substances with similar [[odor]]s.&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/musk | title = Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: ''musk'' | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | accessdate = 2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Pierre |last = Chantraine | title = Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue grecque | publisher = Klincksieck |year= 1990 | pages = 715 | isbn = 2-252-03277-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Musk'' was a name originally given to a substance with a strong odor obtained from a gland of the musk deer. The substance has been used as a popular perfume [[Fixative (perfumery)|fixative]] since ancient times and is one of the most expensive [[animal product]]s in the world. The name originates from the Late Greek μόσχος 'moskhos', from Persian 'mushk', ultimately from [[Sanskrit]] मुष्क muṣka meaning "a testicle", from a diminutive of मूष् mūṣ ("mouse"). &lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|musk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Merriam&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/musk | title = Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: ''musk'' | publisher = [[Merriam-Webster]] | accessdate = 2007-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Pierre |last = Chantraine | title = Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue grecque | publisher =  Klincksieck |year= 1990 | page = 715 | isbn = 2-252-03277-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deer gland was thought to resemble a scrotum. It is applied to various plants and animals of similar smell (e.g. musk-ox, 1744) and has come to encompass a wide variety of aromatic substances with similar odors, despite their often differing [[chemical structure]]s and molecular shapes.

Natural musk was used extensively in [[perfumery]] until the late 19th century when economic and ethical motives led to the adoption of [[synthetic musk]], which is now used almost exclusively.&lt;ref name=Rimkus&gt;{{cite book | title = Synthetic Musk Fragrances in the Environment (Handbook of Environmental Chemistry) | first = Gerhard G. (Ed.)| last = Rimkus |author2=Cornelia Sommer | chapter = The Role of Musk and Musk Compounds in the Fragrance Industry |publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | year = 2004 | isbn = 3-540-43706-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[organic compound]] primarily responsible for the characteristic odor of musk is [[muscone]].

Modern use of natural musk pods occurs in [[traditional Chinese medicine]].

==Natural sources==

===Musk deer===
{{main|Deer musk}}
[[File:Primary Form of Musk.jpg|thumb|A musk pod, obtained from the male [[musk deer]]]]
The musk deer belongs to the family [[Moschidae]] and lives in [[Nepal]], [[Tibet]],&lt;ref name="http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.32106000253184?urlappend=%3Bseq=72"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Historical Section of the Foreign Office (Great Britain)|title="Tibet". Handbook (No. 70)|publisher=H M Staionery Office (1920)|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[China]], [[Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]]. The musk pod is normally obtained by killing the male deer through traps laid in the wild. Upon drying, the reddish-brown paste inside the musk pod turns into a black [[granular material]] called "musk grain", which is then tinctured with alcohol. The aroma of the [[tincture]] gives a pleasant odor only after it is considerably [[:wikt:dilute|dilute]]d. No other natural substance has such a complex aroma associated with so many contradictory descriptions; however, it is usually described abstractly as animalistic, earthy and woody&lt;ref name=Rimkus/&gt; or something akin to the odor of baby's skin.&lt;ref name=Kraft/&gt;

Musk has been a key constituent in many perfumes since its discovery, being held to give a perfume long-lasting power as a fixative. Today, the trade quantity of the natural musk is controlled by [[CITES]], but illegal [[poaching]] and trading continues.&lt;ref name=Kraft&gt;{{cite book | title = Chemistry and Technology of Flavours and Fragrances | first = David J. (Ed.)| last = Rowe |author2=[[Philip Kraft]] | chapter = Chapter 7. Aroma Chemicals IV: Musks | publisher = Blackwell | isbn = 0-8493-2372-X | year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other animals===
[[File:Ondatra zibethicus FWS.jpg|thumb|right|''Ondatra zibethicus'', the [[muskrat]]]]
[[Muskrat]] (''Ondatra zibethicus''), a rodent native to [[North America]], has been known since the 17th century to secrete a glandular substance with a musky odor.&lt;ref name=Groom/&gt; A chemical means of extracting it was discovered in the 1940s, but it did not prove commercially worthwhile.&lt;ref name=Groom&gt;{{cite book | title = New Perfume Handbook | first = Nigel | last = Groom | pages = 219–220 | publisher = Springer | year = 1997 | isbn = 0-7514-0403-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glandular substances with musk-like odors are also obtained from the [[musk duck]] (''Biziura lobata'') of southern [[Australia]], the [[muskox]], the [[musk shrew]], the [[musk beetle]] (''Aromia moschata''), the [[African civet]] (''Civettictis civetta''), the [[Sternotherus odoratus|musk turtle]] (''Sternotherus odoratus''), the [[American alligator]] of [[North America]],  lynx musk, ''lungurion'' which, in antiquity, was highly valued, and from several other animals.

In [[crocodile]]s, there are two pairs of musk glands, one pair situated at the corner of the jaw and the other pair in the [[cloaca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Elsevier's Dictionary of Herpetological and Related Terminology | first = D.C. |last = Wareham | publisher = [[Elsevier Science]] | year = 2005 | isbn =0-444-51863-0 | pages = 129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Musk glands are also found in snakes.

===Plants===
{{NIE Poster|Musk Plant}}
Some plants such as ''[[Angelica archangelica]]'' or ''[[Abelmoschus moschatus]]'' produce musky-smelling macrocyclic lactone compounds. These compounds are widely used in perfumery as substitutes for animal musk or to alter the smell of a mixture of other musks.

The plant sources include the musk flower (''[[Mimulus moschatus]]'') of western North America, the muskwood (''[[Olearia argophylla]]'') of Australia, and the musk seeds (''[[Abelmoschus moschatus]]'') from India.

==Artificial compounds==
{{main|Synthetic musk}}
[[File:Galaxolide 200.svg|thumb|[[Galaxolide]], a polycyclic musk commonly found in [[laundry detergent]]s to mask the smell of the detergent chemicals]]
Since obtaining the deer musk requires killing the [[Endangered species|endangered animal]], nearly all musk fragrance used in perfumery today is synthetic, sometimes called "white musk". They can be divided into three major classes: aromatic nitro musks, polycyclic musk compounds, and macrocyclic musk compounds.&lt;ref name=Rimkus/&gt; The first two groups have broad uses in industry ranging from [[cosmetics]] to [[detergent]]s. However, the detection of the first two chemical groups in human and environmental samples as well as their carcinogenic properties initiated a public debate on the use of these compounds and a ban or reduction of their use in many regions of the world. Macrocyclic musk compounds are expected to replace them since these compounds appear to be safer.&lt;ref name=Rimkus/&gt;

==Other uses==

Musk has been used to attract wild animals, including in man-made perfume mixtures. For example, in 2018 Indian authorities used the perfume ''Obsession'' by [[Calvin Klein]] to attract and thus trap a wild tiger that had attacked and killed more than a dozen humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Calvin Klein's Obsession Could Be The Trick To Catching A Tiger |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/10/14/657238908/calvin-kleins-obsession-could-be-the-trick-to-catching-a-tiger |website=NPR |date=14 October 2018 |access-date=18 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Citations|date=July 2017}}[[File:Orange Peel Effect.jpg|thumb|A photo of the orange peel effect on a car door. (Click for a larger photo.)]]
'''Orange peel''' is a certain kind of finish that may develop on [[paint]]ed and cast surfaces, even screen protectors.&lt;ref name=ks&gt;{{Citation| title = KS (spin casting alloy)| url =http://www.nyrstar.com/en/productsServices/products/zinc/ZincAlloysZamakProducts/Zinc-Spincasting-Product-KS/KS-Zamak2withhigherMagnesiumZincAlloyforSpinCasting.htm| accessdate = 2008-03-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The texture resembles the surface of the skin of an [[Orange (fruit)|orange]].
Gloss paint sprayed on a smooth surface (such as the body of a [[car]]) should also dry into a smooth surface. However, various factors can cause it to dry into a bumpy surface resembling the texture of an [[Orange (fruit)|orange]] peel. The orange peel phenomenon can then be smoothed out with ultra-fine [[sandpaper]], but it can be prevented altogether by changing the painting technique or the materials used. Orange peel is typically the result of improper painting technique, and is caused by the quick evaporation of [[Paint thinner|thinner]], incorrect spray gun setup (e.g., low air pressure or incorrect nozzle), spraying the paint at an angle other than perpendicular, or applying excessive paint. 

In some situations, such as interior house paint, the orange peel texture is desirable.  In this case, a texture paint is generally applied with a spray gun.  The texture is then painted over with the appropriate color.  When painting walls, orange peel can also develop by using a [[Paint roller|roller]] with too little paint or too thick a paint and the surface dries before the texture can level.

==Measurement==

The instruments used to measure orange peel simulate visual perception. Like our eyes, the instruments optically scan the wavy light/dark pattern. Two types of instruments are available to quantify the texture or waviness of a surface:

'''Orange peel meter'''

The orange peel meter uses a laser point light source to illuminate the specimen at a 60° angle and uses a detector to measure the reflected light intensity at the equal but opposite angle. The instrument is rolled across the surface and measures point by point the optical profile of the surface across a defined distance. The instruments analyse the structures according to their size. In order to simulate the human eye's resolution at various distances, the measurement signal is divided into several ranges using mathematical filter functions:

*Wa 0.1 ..... 0.3 mm wavelength
*Wb 0.3 ........ 1 mm wavelength
*Wc 1............ 3 mm wavelength
*Wd 3 ......... 10 mm wavelength
*We 10 ....... 30 mm wavelength
*SW 0.3 ..... 1.2 mm wavelength
*LW 1.2....... 12 mm wavelength
[http://i.imgur.com/BVLvE.png Simplified Measurement Diagram]

Structures smaller than 0.1 mm also influence visual perception, therefore the instruments use a CCD camera to measure the diffused light caused by these fine structures. This parameter is referred to as "dullness".

The values of dullness and Wa to We form a "structure spectrum". This allows a detailed analysis of orange peel and its influencing factors, being material or application parameters.
[http://i.imgur.com/pxD1i.png Example of a "structure spectrum"]

The detailed information of the structure spectrum as well as LW and SW became the basis to correlate to specific scales and to the DOI as described in [http://www.astm.org/Standards/E430.htm ASTM E430].

'''Phase stepped deflectometer'''

Phase stepped deflectometry (PSD) is a white light optical technique that uses a fringe pattern projected from a high definition screen to capture the reflected image of the pattern using a high definition camera. 
The sinusoidal waveform acts like a ruler over the surface allowing the relative ordinates of the light source points to be quantified as they are proportional to the spatial phase of the sinusoidal pattern waveform. By using a standard technique known as “phase stepping”  accurate measurement of each point across the surface can be made through quantifying the corresponding point per pixel on the camera. 

Using the known geometric relationship between the display, the object surface and the camera, light rays reflected from the surface can be spatially modelled to calculate the direction of the normal at each point of the surface thereby allowing the profile at that point to be obtained. By displaying the sinusoidal waveform in both horizontal and vertical directions the surface slopes can be determined in both orthogonal directions. 

By differentiating the measurement data the curvature field can be calculated allowing accurate characterisation of a surface profile. To simulate the human eye's resolution at various distances the specific band pass filtering is applied to the curvature data separating the structure data according to size:

*Ka 0.1 ..... 0.3 mm wavelength
*Kb 0.3 ........ 1 mm wavelength
*Kc 1............ 3 mm wavelength
*Kd 3 ......... 10 mm wavelength
*Ke 10 ....... 30 mm wavelength
*Ks 0.3 ..... 1.2 mm wavelength
*Kl 1.2....... 12 mm wavelength

This information is then converted into texture data (waviness) by applying standardised equations. 
Unlike other slope and curvature measurement methods, PSD is a full-field technique that does not require any mechanical movement of the device nor translation of the sensor or the surface under test; all angular and positioning errors related to this translation are therefore avoided.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4253">'''Park McArthur''' (born 1984, North Carolina, USA) is an artist living in [[New York City]] who works in [[sculpture]], [[Installation art|installation]], [[Writing|text]], and [[sound]]. McArthur is a wheelchair user whose work uses this position to inform her art.

==Life and work==
McArthur graduated with a Masters in Fine Art from the [[University of Miami]] in 2009 and studied at the Whitney Museum of American Art’s Independent Study Program, 2011-2012. About McArthur's 2014 exhibition ''Ramps'', wherein the artist exhibited the wheelchair ramps of institutions with which she had previously worked, writer Andrew Blackley said, "The exhibition displayed the means by which institutions both produce and deny access. Each ramp challenged reappraisal and reinforced a set of past and future foreclosures. ‘Ramps’ enlisted generative, generous responses to the negativity of the institution, to the point of engendering the reproduction of those very negative characteristics (by removing the objects’ previously assumed ‘function’). By extension, at stake and always under threat are the threaded relationships between queerness and disability, the breakdown of their concomitant binaries and the temporality of care."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blackley|first1=Andrew|title=Park McArthur: Geometry, Material, Scale|journal=Afterall Journal|date=Autumn–Winter 2015|pages=54–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In alignment with [[postmodern marketing]], '''postmodern branding''' hinges on personifying the brand based on a core set of traits as opposed to creating templates, blueprints or guidelines.  Postmodern branding is more about understanding and leveraging technology, space and mindset of the moment to create an enriched user experience. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Idris Mootee cites in, “Branding in the Post-Modern Culture When Consumer Transcends the State of Being the Subject in a Society” that brands are becoming more and more important in this day of age.  When looking at how the media ecosystem has evolved with the developments of [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], mobile codes and [[video]], a marketer can see that the brand “exists beyond the ads and the products”.  As a result brands have found new ways to enter the home and places in the consumers life. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.futurelab.be/blogs/marketing-strategy-innovation/2007/10/branding_in_the_postmodern_cul.html

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These are behaviors predominantly found in the daily life of the postmodern consumer.  Watching scheduled [[TV]] programs, utilizing and interacting with voice recognition services like [[Siri (software)|Siri]] are examples of how branded content and utilities are becoming more predominate within our current culture.  Although some examples are eroding away like scheduled TV viewing (according to [[JD Power and Associates]] roughly 45% of cable TV service customer have a [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] subscription, which is up from 38% in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.telecompetitor.com/dvrs-fueling-video-arpu-growth-telcos-beat-cable-for-tv-satisfaction/ |title=Residential Television Service Satisfaction Study |publisher=telecompetitor.com |date=2011-10-13 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;), others are introduces with remarkable interfaces and user engagement protocols.  Mobile applications like [[Siri (software)|Siri]] allow users interact with their phone at treat it like a personal assistant.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Successful branding within the postmodern society rely more on the developments of brand personality.  Developing brand personality sets the stage in identifying deeper meaning around “How it, the brand, works.”&lt;ref name="Warschauer"&gt;{{cite journal

According to this theory, inherent traits (habitual patterns, thoughts and emotions) are perceived to remain relatively stable over time.&lt;ref&gt; [[Saul Kassin]], (2003). ''Psychology''. USA: Prentice-Hall, Inc. &lt;/ref&gt; Holding inherent traits constant while manipulating environmental cues and situational stimuli, natural personalities emerge.  When applied to marketing, this process is called a brand-trait observational research study. By performing such studies a brand is able to extract “marketable” personalities; thus creating “livable brand personas”.  These personas are then used to help brands live better and more fluently within social destinations, communities and strategist around technical road maps, developments and customer interactions.

[[File:Petroglyphs in Teimareh, Khomein, Iran.jpg|thumb|Petroglyphs in Teimareh, Khomein, Iran]]
'''Rock art in Iran''' includes archaeological [[petroglyph]]s, or carving in rock; [[rock art#pictograph|pictographs]], or painting on rock; and [[rock reliefs]]. Large numbers of prehistoric [[rock art]], more than 50,000, have been discovered in [[Iran]]. 

Dating back to 40,800 years before present in Iran, rock art is the oldest surviving artwork. Prehistoric rock art provides insights into past eras and cultures. Archaeologists classify the tools for carving petroglyphs by their historical era. Incising tools include flint, metal, or thigh bones of hunted prey. 

The largest rock art panel in Iran, located near [[Malayer]] in [[Hamadan Province]] spans 12 meters and features more than 100 petroglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bradshawfoundation.com/middle_east/iran_rock_art/index.php|title=Middle East Rock Art Archive: Iran Rock Art Gallery|first= |last= |work=Bradshaw Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chronology ==
The earliest known petroglyphs are in [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golpayegan Timareh]]] dating back to 40,800 years ago. The earliest known pictographs in Iran are in [[Yafteh]] cave in [[Lorestan Province]] and date back 40,000 years.

Ancient Iranian pottery and bronze sculpture continue designs found in the rock art. This continuity suggests the impressiveness of petroglyphs of the facades of caves and rocks reflected to ancient Iranian artisans.This continuity can be traced from eighth millennium BCE by the potteries in Ganj Darreh near Harseen in Kermanshah state, to the third and first millennium BCE, considering the bronze period in Lorestan.

Iran provides exclusive demonstrations of script formation from pictogram, ideogram, linear (2300 BCE) or proto-Elamite, geometric old Elamite script, Pahlavi script, Arabic script (906 years ago), Kufi script, and Farsi script back to at least 250 years ago. 

The most recent chronology of petroglyphs in Iran was done employing the [[General Antiparticle Spectrometer]] in 2008 that helped gather data from random samples; though, this is a demanding job that needs a systematic and comprehensive supported effort.

== Categories ==
[[File:Taimerh 3.jpg|thumb|Curious boy sitting near petroglyphs]]
Pictographs that contain pictures drawn by pigments like smut, crystallized blood, ochre, that were employed by binders like animal fats, blood, seed oil and organic compounds, or a mixture of all materials mentioned above. Lorestan has the most and oldest pictographs in Iran. Yafteh cave in Lorestan has pictographs dating back to 40,000 years ago.Compared to petroglyphs, pictographs in Iran are scarce and rare.

The '''Royal Army Medical College (RAMC)''' was located on a site south of the [[Tate Gallery]] (now known as Tate Britain) on [[Millbank]], in [[Westminster]], London, overlooking the [[River Thames]]. The college moved from the site in 1999 and the buildings are now occupied by the [[Chelsea College of Arts]].

==History==
[[File:OS Millbank Tate etc 2.jpg|250px|thumb|Ordnance Survey maps of London extract for 1916. This shows clearly the octagonal outline of the former penitentiary surrounding the small site. At the centre is the National Gallery of British Art, afterwards known as the Tate Gallery, and now as [[Tate Britain]], with the college in the south of the site and hospital in the north. Most of the streets remain as at 2012 apart from Bulinga Street, most of which has been built over, and Dundonald Street which has been renamed 'John Islip Street'. There is a 'Census Office' at the rear of the gallery, long since gone.]]

The site, including that of the Tate Gallery (which opened in 1897), was previously occupied by the [[Millbank Prison]] from 1821 to the late 19th century. The college was built by John Henry Townsend and Wilfred Ainslie in Imperial [[Baroque]] style. They also designed the adjoining Regimental Officers’ [[Mess]] and Commandant's House, in [[French Renaissance]] style. The buildings were opened by [[King Edward VII]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]] on 15 May 1907. A statue of Sir [[James McGrigor]], the father of army medicine, originally at the [[Royal Hospital, Chelsea]] was moved to the grounds in 1907 and then moved again to the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101452265-statue-of-sir-james-robert-mcgrigor-b-g-m-d-at-royal-military-academy-sandhurst-surrey-heath-borough-council-st-michaels-ward#.Wka1l2hl8dU|title=Statue of Sir James Robert McGrigor B. G., M. D. at Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|publisher=British listed buildings|accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Alexandra's Military Hospital]] was built to the north of the Tate Gallery and opened in 1905. [[Cooper Perry|Sir Cooper Perry]] was [[knighted]] in 1903 for helping set up the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35486 |first=H. L. |last=Eason|title=Perry, Sir (Edwin) Cooper (1856–1938)|publisher= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2004|accessdate= 5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War I|First World War]] the college was used to prepare vaccines, including a vaccine against [[typhoid]] which was developed at the college. The college also researched into protection against chemical warfare including the development of [[gas masks]] here. In the second World War, the college provided courses in tropical medicine. The college was seriously damaged in 1941 by bombs and the walls of the Tate Gallery nearby still show signs of the damage.&lt;ref name ="45_Millbank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45millbank.com/history-of-45-millbank.html |title=History of 45 Millbank|publisher=|accessdate= 6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area around the college including the Tate, former military hospital and other adjacent areas is a conservation area.&lt;ref name = "WCC"&gt;[http://www3.westminster.gov.uk/docstores/publications_store/Millbank%20CAA%20SPG.pdf Millbank Conservation Area] – Westminster City Council, January 2005, accessed 6 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The former college buildings are now [[listed buildings|listed]].&lt;ref&gt;Southern Block {{NHLE|num=1066501|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;br/&gt;Officers Mess and Commandants House {{NHLE|num=1376570|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;br&gt;Statue{{NHLE|num=1066502|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;br&gt;Former barracks (1) {{NHLE|num=1376572|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;br&gt;Former barracks (2) {{NHLE|num=1376571|accessdate=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Salon des Refusés''', French for "exhibition of rejects" ({{IPA-fr|salɔ̃ de ʁəfyze}}), is generally an exhibition of works rejected by the jury of the official [[Paris Salon]], but the term is most famously used to refer to the ''Salon des Refusés'' of 1863.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k114147v Catalogue des ouvrages de peinture, sculpture, gravure, lithographie et architecture : refusés par le Jury de 1863 et exposés, par décision de S.M. l'Empereur au salon annexe, palais des Champs-Elysées, le 15 mai 1863], Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boime"&gt;{{cite journal

Today by extension, ''salon des refusés'' refers to any exhibition of works rejected from a juried art show.

==Background of the Salon of 1863==
The [[Paris Salon]], sponsored by the French government and the Academy of Fine Arts, took place annually, and was a showcase of the best academic art.  A medal from the Salon was assurance of a successful artistic career;  winners were given official commissions by the French government, and were sought after for portraits and private commissions.  Since the 18th century, the paintings were classified by genre, following a specific hierarchy;  history paintings were ranked first, followed by the portrait, the landscape, the "genre scene", and the still life.  The jury, headed by the Comte de Nieuwerkerke, the head of the Academy of Fine Arts, was very conservative; near-photographic but idealized realism was expected.&lt;ref&gt;Meneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial- la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire'' Éditions Armand Colin, (1990).&lt;/ref&gt;

Much intrigue often went on to get acceptance, and to be given a good place in the galleries.  In 1851, [[Gustave Courbet]] managed to get one painting into the Salon, ''Enterrement á Ornans'', and in 1852 his ''Baigneuses'' was accepted, scandalizing critics and the public, who expected romanticized nudes in classical settings, but in 1855 the Salon refused all of Courbet's paintings.  As early as the 1830s, Paris art galleries mounted small-scale, private exhibitions of works rejected by the Salon jurors.  Courbet was obliged to organize his own exhibit, called ''Le Realism'', at a private gallery.  Private exhibits attracted far less attention from the press and patrons, and limited the access of the artists to a small public.

In 1863 the Salon jury refused two thirds of the paintings presented, including the works of [[Gustave Courbet]],  [[Édouard Manet]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Johan Jongkind]]. The rejected artists and their friends protested, and the protests reached Emperor [[Napoleon III]]. The Emperor's tastes in art were traditional; he commissioned and bought works by artists such as [[Alexandre Cabanel]] and [[Franz Xaver Winterhalter]], but he was also sensitive to public opinion. His office issued a statement: "Numerous complaints have come to the Emperor on the subject of the works of art which were refused by the jury of the Exposition.  His Majesty, wishing to let the public judge the legitimacy of these complaints, has decided that the works of art which were refused should be displayed in another part of the Palace of Industry."&lt;ref&gt;Published in ''Le Moniteur'' on 24 April 1863. Cited in Maneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial - La vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire,'' p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than a thousand visitors a day visited the Salon des Refusés. The journalist [[Émile Zola]] reported that visitors pushed  to get into the crowded galleries where the refused paintings were hung, and the rooms were full of the laughter of the spectators.&lt;ref&gt;Meneglier, Hervé, ''Paris Impérial- la vie quotidienne sous le Second Empire,'' Éditions Armand Colin, (1990). p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics and the public ridiculed the ''refusés'', which included such now-famous paintings as [[Édouard Manet]]'s ''[[Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' and James McNeill Whistler's ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl]]''. But the critical attention also legitimized the emerging avant-garde in painting.

The Impressionists successfully exhibited their works outside the traditional Salon beginning in 1874. Subsequent Salons des Refusés were mounted in Paris in 1874, 1875, and 1886, by which time the popularity of the Paris Salon had declined for those who were more interested in Impressionism.

Rejected by the Salon jury of 1863, Manet seized the opportunity to exhibit ''[[Déjeuner sur l'herbe]]'' and two other paintings in the 1863 Salon des Refusés.&lt;ref name="Boime 2007 676"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boime|first=Albert|title=Art in an Age of Civil Struggle|year=2007|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-0-226-06328-7|pages=676}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Déjeuner sur l'herbe'' depicts the juxtaposition of a [[female nude]] and a scantily dressed female bather in the background, on a picnic with two fully dressed men in a rural setting. The painting sparked public notoriety and stirred up controversy and has remained controversial, even to this day. [[Odilon Redon]], for example, did not like it. There is a discussion of it, from this point of view, in [[Proust]]'s ''[[Remembrance of Things Past]]''.

One interpretation of the work is that it depicts the rampant prostitution in the ''[[Bois de Boulogne]]'', a large park at the western outskirts of Paris, at the time. This prostitution was common knowledge in Paris, but was considered a taboo subject unsuitable for a painting.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Gartner, ''Art and Architecture: Musee D'Orsay'', 2001, p. 180. {{ISBN|0-7607-2889-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the ''Bois de Boulogne'' is to this day known as a pick-up place for prostitutes and illicit sexual activity after dark, just as it had been in the 19th century.

[[Émile Zola]] comments about ''Déjeuner sur l'herbe'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Luncheon on the Grass'' is the greatest work of Édouard Manet, one in which he realizes the dream of all painters: to place figures of natural grandeur in a landscape.  We know the power with which he vanquished this difficulty.  There are some leaves, some tree trunks, and, in the background, a river in which a chemise-wearing woman bathes; in the foreground, two young men are seated across from a second woman who has just exited the water and who dries her naked skin in the open air.  This nude woman has scandalized the public, who see only her in the canvas.  My God!  What indecency: a woman without the slightest covering between two clothed men!  That has never been seen.  And this belief is a gross error, for in the [[Louvre]] there are more than fifty paintings in which are found mixes of persons clothed and nude.  But no one goes to the Louvre to be scandalized.  The crowd has kept itself moreover from judging ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' like a veritable work of art should be judged; they see in it only some people who are having a picnic, finishing bathing, and they believed that the artist had placed an obscene intent in the disposition of the subject, while the artist had simply sought to obtain vibrant oppositions and a straightforward audience.  Painters, especially Édouard Manet, who is an analytic painter, do not have this preoccupation with the subject which torments the crowd above all; the subject, for them, is merely a pretext to paint, while for the crowd, the subject alone exists.  Thus, assuredly, the nude woman of ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' is only there to furnish the artist the occasion to paint a bit of flesh.  That which must be seen in the painting is not a luncheon on the grass; it is the entire landscape, with its vigors and its finesses, with its foregrounds so large, so solid, and its backgrounds of a light delicateness; it is this firm modeled flesh under great spots of light, these tissues supple and strong, and particularly this delicious silhouette of a woman wearing a chemise who makes, in the background, an adorable dapple of white in the milieu of green leaves.  It is, in short, this vast ensemble, full of atmosphere, this corner of nature rendered with a simplicity so just, all of this admirable page in which an artist has placed all the particular and rare elements which are in him.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Zola, ''Édouard Manet,'' 1867,  et lps 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Émile Zola]] incorporated a fictionalized account of the 1863 scandal in his novel ''[[L'Œuvre]]'' ''(The Masterpiece)'' (1886).

In 1861, after returning to Paris for a time, [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] painted his first famous work, ''[[Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl]]''. This portrait of his mistress and business manager [[Joanna Hiffernan]] was created as a simple study in white; however, others saw it differently. The critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]] thought the painting an allegory of a new bride's lost innocence. Others linked it to [[Wilkie Collins]]'s ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'', a popular novel of the time, or various other literary sources. In England, some considered it a painting in the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] manner.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson and Koval, pgs. 106, 119&lt;/ref&gt; In the painting, Hiffernan holds a lily in her left hand and stands upon a bear skin rug (interpreted by some to represent masculinity and lust) with the bear's head staring menacingly at the viewer.

Countering criticism by traditionalists, Whistler's supporters insisted that the painting was "an apparition with a spiritual content" and that it epitomized his theory that art should be concerned essentially with the arrangement of colors in harmony, not with a literal portrayal of the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Whistler started working on ''The White Girl'' shortly after December 3, 1861, with the intention of submitting it to the prestigious [[Royal Academy summer exhibition|annual exhibition]] of the [[Royal Academy]]. In spite of bouts of illness, he finished the painting by April .&lt;ref name="Sp300"&gt;Spencer (1998), p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; The portrait was refused for exhibition at the conservative Royal Academy, but in 1863 it was accepted at the Salon des Refusés in Paris, an event sponsored by Emperor [[Napoleon III]] for the exhibition of works rejected from the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/whistlersite/whitegirl.htm Whistler explained his purpose in making the painting, ''Symphony in White''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905065722/http://www.dia.org/exhibitions/whistlersite/whitegirl.htm |date=2013-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[George du Maurier]] in early 1862 Whistler wrote of the painting:

{{quote|... a woman in a beautiful white cambric dress, standing against a window which filters the light through a transparent white muslin curtain – but the figure receives a strong light from the right and therefore the picture, barring the red hair, is one gorgeous mass of brilliant white.&lt;ref name="Taylor27"&gt;Taylor (1978), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Whistler submitted the painting to the Academy, but according to Joanna Hiffernan, he expected it to be rejected.&lt;ref name="Sp300"/&gt; The previous year, in 1861, another painting had caused a minor scandal. [[Edwin Henry Landseer]]'s ''The Shrew Tamed'' showed a horse with a woman resting on the ground nearby. The model was named as Ann Gilbert,&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Saturday, May 04, 1861; pg. 12; Issue 23924; col A&lt;/ref&gt; a noted equestrienne of the period,&lt;ref&gt;She offered her professional services to render ladies' horses "quiet, safe and pleasant to ride":''The Times'', Friday, Jun 20, 1856; pg. 2; Issue 22399; col A&lt;/ref&gt; however it was soon rumored that it was actually [[Catherine Walters]], the notorious London [[courtesan]].&lt;ref&gt;Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine Vol. 90 (550) Aug 1861 Page 211:'"The Shrew Tamed" - a high-bred horse of soft silken coat, dappled with play of light and shade as on velvet, subdued by a "pretty horsebreaker", is certainly unfortunate as a subject. This picture has been made the more notorious by "The Belgravian Lament", which took the well-known rider as a text whereon to point a moral. We hope it will now be felt by Sir Edwin Landseer and his friends that the intrusion of "pretty horsebreakers" on the walls of the Academy is not less to be regretted than their presence in Rotten Row.'&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler's painting was reminiscent enough of Landseer's that the judges were wary of admitting it.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer (1998), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; ''White Girl'' was submitted to the Academy along with three etchings, all three of which were accepted, while the painting was not.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson &amp; Koval (1994), pp. 129–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Whistler exhibited it at the small Berners Street Gallery in London instead.&lt;ref name="Taylor27"/&gt; The next year, Whistler tried to have the painting exhibited at the ''Salon'' in Paris – the official art exhibition of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] – but it was rejected there as well.&lt;ref name="Craven"&gt;Craven (2003), pp. 342–3.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it was accepted at the alternative ''Salon des Refusés'' – the "exhibition of rejects" that opened on May 15, two weeks after the official ''Salon''.&lt;ref&gt;Weintraub (1974), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although others said while Whistler's painting was widely noticed, he was upstaged by Manet's more shocking painting ''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe''.&lt;ref name="Craven"/&gt; The controversy surrounding the paintings was described in [[Émile Zola]]'s novel ''[[L'Œuvre]]'' (1886).&lt;ref name="Sp300"/&gt; The reception Whistler's painting received was mostly favourable, however, and largely vindicated him after the rejection he had experienced both in London and in Paris.&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;Newton &amp; MacDonald (1978), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was greatly admired by his colleagues and friends Manet, the painter [[Gustave Courbet]] and the poet [[Charles Baudelaire]]. The art critic [[Théophile Thoré-Bürger]] saw it in the tradition of [[Francisco Goya|Goya]] and [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]]. There were, however, those who were less favourable; certain French critics saw the English Pre-Raphaelite trend as somewhat eccentric.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer (1998), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Art historian [[Albert Boime]] wrote: "The Salon des Refusés introduced the democratic concept of a multi-style system (much like a multi-party system) subject to the review of the general jury of the public."&lt;ref name="Boime"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5050">'''Sillage''' (\si.jaʒ\) in [[perfume]] refers to the aura or trail created by a perfume when it is worn on the skin. It comes from the word in French for "wake" and can best be described as how a fragrance diffuses around the wearer. Sillage or diffusion in fragrances can also be called the "projection" of a fragrance.

Compounds such as [[Hedione]] (methyl dihydrojasmonate) can be used to enhance the diffusivity of a fragrance. Hedione is a synthetic relative of [[methyl jasmonate]],  a naturally occurring compound in floral scents such as [[jasmine]], [[Polianthes tuberosa|tuberose]] and [[magnolia]]. Methyl jasmonate is also found in many other plant parts and is considered to be a signalling molecule. It is considered one of the compounds responsible for the projection of the scent in living flowers and was first fully characterised in between 1957 and 1962 in jasmine absolute (0.8%) by the fragrance chemist [[Edouard Demole]] who was working at [[Firmenich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Theimer |first1=Ernst T |title=Fragrance Chemistry Science of the Sense of Smell, The. |date=2014 |publisher=Elsevier Science |isbn=9780323138604 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1044713310 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first commercially successful fragrance to utilise Hedione was [[Eau Sauvage]] by perfumer [[Edmond Roudnitska]] for [[Parfums Christian Dior|Christian Dior]] , launched in 1966. The addition of Hedione to a classically hesperidic fragrance construction created a dewy lemony magnolia-jasmine dimension without being directly floral, and gave it a new type of projection and transparency not experienced before in this type of perfume. {{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} This is considered to be the beginning of a new trend in perfumery towards transparency and projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berger |first1=Ralf Günter |title=Scent and Chemistry. The Molecular World of Odors. By Günther Ohloff, Wilhelm Pickenhagen and Philip Kraft. |date=2012 |url=https://doi.org/10.1002/anie.201201256 |language=en|doi=10.1002/anie.201201256|publisher=Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA, Weinheim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounds such as [[Damascone|damascones,]] Iso-E super, [[linalool]] and some of the synthetic musks such as [[cashmeran]] may also be added to fragrances to enhance their diffusion and sillage.

A fragrance does not need to be a heavy one to have a large sillage;   fragrances such as Giorgio Beverly Hills for women and Poison (Dior) are very good examples of this. Eau Sauvage and [[L'eau d'Issey]] ([[Jacques Cavallier|Jaques Cavallier]] for [[Issey Miyake]]) have a large sillage but may be considered much lighter examples of this.

Sillage in a perfume could also be considered to be how a fragrance is perceived by others around the wearer and is enhanced by motion, ambient temperature as well as the inherent qualities of the skin. According to an article by Mookerjee, a fragrance is perceived by the diffusion of individual fragrance molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mookerjee |first1=B. D |last2=Patel |first2=S. M |last3=Trenkle |first3=R. W |last4=Wilson |first4=R.

Once a fragrance is applied to the skin, the skin itself becomes a substrate to the scent. The inherent scent of the individual skin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lenochová |first1=Pavlína |last2=Vohnoutová |first2=Pavla |last3=Roberts |first3=S.

'''''Sueño de una tarde dominical en la Alameda Central''''' or '''''Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the [[Mexico City Alameda Central|Alameda Central]]''''' is a [[mural]] created by [[Diego Rivera]]. It was painted between the years 1946 and 1947, and is the principal work of the [[Museo Mural Diego Rivera]] adjacent to the Alameda in the [[Historic center of Mexico City|historic center]] of [[Mexico City]].

==History==

The mural was originally created at the request of architect [[Carlos Obregón Santacilia]] for the Versailles
Restaurant of the Hotel Del Prado, which was located across the street. When the hotel was rendered uninhabitable in the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]] and condemned for demolition, the mural was restored and moved to its own museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museomuraldiegorivera.bellasartes.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=240&amp;Itemid=118 Hotel del Prado]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The mural depicts famous people and events in the [[history of Mexico]], passing through the [[Mexico City Alameda Central|Alameda Central]] park in Mexico City. Some notable figures include [[Frida Kahlo]], [[José Guadalupe Posada]],  [[Francisco I. Madero]], [[Benito Juárez]], [[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]], [[Porfirio Díaz]], [[Agustín de Iturbide]], [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], [[Maximilian I of Mexico]],  [[Juan de Zumárraga]], [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], [[Winfield Scott]], [[Victoriano Huerta]], [[José Martí]], [[Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera]], [[Hernán Cortés]], [[Nicolás Zúñiga y Miranda]], and [[La Malinche]].

The central focus of the mural is on a display of bourgeois complacency and values shortly before the [[Mexican Revolution of 1910]]. Elegantly dressed upper-class figures promenade under the figure of the long ruling dictator Porfirio Díaz. An indigenous family is forced back by police batons and to the right flames and violence loom. To the far left, victims of the Inquisition, wearing the penitential sanbenito robes and the conical coroza hat, are consigned to the flames at an auto-da-fé. The center of the mural is dominated by the elegantly dressed skeleton [[La Calavera Catrina]] holding arms with the Mexican graphic artist who first conceived and drew her, [[José Guadalupe Posada]] in a black suit and cane. La Catrina wears a [[Feathered Serpent]] boa around her shoulders. On [[La Calavera Catrina|La Catrina's]] right she is holding hands with a child version of [[Diego Rivera]] in short pants. Rivera's wife [[Frida Kahlo]] is standing just behind and between him and La Catrina; Kahlo has her hand on Rivera's shoulder and she is holding a [[yin-yang]] device. [[La Malinche]] and [[José Guadalupe Posada|Posada]] are staring directly into each other's eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museomuraldiegorivera.bellasartes.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=239&amp;Itemid=117 Dream of a Sunday afternoon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616182940/http://www.museomuraldiegorivera.bellasartes.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=239&amp;Itemid=117 |date=2013-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of '''technology brokering''' is to span multiple, otherwise disconnected industries, to see how existing technologies could be used to create breakthrough innovations in other markets. Technology brokering requires companies to be strong in two areas.&lt;ref name="Hargadon"&gt;Hargadon, A. (2003, November/December). Retooling R&amp;D: Technology brokering and the pursuit of innovation. Ivey Business Journal. Retrieved April 18, 2009, from http://andrewhargadon.com/Release/Hargadon_Ivey_Retooling.pdf{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} As Andrew Hargadon, technology brokering’s founder, summarized: "Firstly, the company must have the ability to bridge distant communities, usually when a company can move easily across a range of different markets they have a better view of how technologies can be used in new ways. Secondly, technology brokering involves creating new markets and industries from innovative combinations of existing technology. These two strengths are difficult to have simultaneously because the strong ties the companies have with customers and supplies in one industry prevent the company from moving easily into other markets and experimenting with new ideas."&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Yet, when a company is able to combine these two strengths it can result in being the first to experience technological advances.

Technology brokering can teach firms how to effectively shift the focus of traditional R&amp;D teams from trying to invent completely new products to combining previous innovations. New ideas for observation based research pull R&amp;D scientists out of the lab and place them into direct consumer observation to allow them to diagnose problems with products and identify the needs of the customer more accurately.&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|7}} The technology brokering process intertwines with the idea of [[empathic design]], which is basically understanding products from a customers’ point of view and then designing them to fit needs and issues. The advantage of empathic design, especially when combined with technology brokering firms, is that it leads to innovative products that suit the particular problems of the customer. Another perk of empathic design is including marketing and manufacturing people in the product design to get diverse opinions of product success and practicality.

==History==
The first examples of technology brokering can be found as early as 1876 with [[Thomas Edison]] in his [[Menlo Park, New Jersey|Menlo Park]] laboratory. In six years, this lab procured over 400 patents.&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Menlo Park laboratory was such a successful ‘invention factory’ because Thomas Edison had a firm belief in [[recombinant innovation]]. There were no inventions from Menlo Park that were truly invented from nothing – each one had some basis that was pulled from another field of technology. Edison and his team worked in many different fields in conjunction with many different companies, in addition to working on individual experiments. All of these projects enabled the team to use their knowledge of various fields to be innovative in creating new solutions for different organizations. Because knowledge of technology across differing fields was disconnected, Edison was able to exploit this and create new solutions from areas of past projects.

[[Henry Ford]] is another great inventor in history who understood the power of combining past solutions to create a new one. He is famous for the [[model T]] automobile and the assembly line, but Ford himself stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I invented nothing new. I simply assembled into a car the discoveries of other men behind whom were centuries of work….Had I worked fifty or ten or even five years before, I would have failed. So it is with every new thing. Progress happens when all the factors that make for it are ready, and then it is inevitable. To teach that a comparatively few men are responsible for the greatest forward steps of mankind is the worst sort of nonsense."&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|3}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The knowledge of recombinant innovation is alive and thriving today. Companies such as IDEO can easily have their processes compared to Edison’s operations of the Menlo Park laboratory. IDEO is arguably one of the largest and most successful design firms of the current times. Since its founding in 1978, it has created 3,000 new products in over 40 industries.&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|5}} Working amidst several different industries is a large factor of success in technology brokering. The more industries that firms are involved in, the broader their understanding of different technologies will be. CEO of IDEO David Kelley has this to say about working in many different fields:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Working with companies in such dissimilar industries as medical instruments, furniture, toys and computers has given us a broad view of the latest technologies available and has taught us how to do quality product development and how to do it quickly and efficiently."&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|5}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many companies today are restructuring their [[R&amp;D departments]] and they are finding the structure of technology brokering to be very successful and cost-effective for innovation. Not only is technology brokering a business foundation for design firms, it can also be used inside large corporations in order to achieve inter-departmental innovations. Andrew Hargadon was really the first person to coin the term ‘technology brokering’ and advocate to industry its advantages. He did this in the late 1980s, early 1990s, now the concept of technology brokering is fairly common. The Hargadon Group currently advises businesses ranging from [[Fortune 500]] companies to start-ups about how to integrate a technology brokering system into their innovation process.

==Examples==

===Firms===
'''IDEO'''

IDEO is the largest product design consulting firm in the U.S. It focuses on [[mechanical engineering]] and [[industrial design]], and pursues products with high performance, ease of manufacturing, and ease of use. The current CEO and President of IDEO is Tim Brown. The Palo Alto (CA) based company has smaller offices in Boston, Chicago, Grand Rapids, London, San Francisco, New York, and Tokyo.&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"&gt;Hargadon, Andrew; Sutton, Robert I. "Technology brokering and innovation in a product development firm." Administrative Science Quarterly, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1991, IDEO has topped Business Week's list of winners of the annual [[Industrial Design Excellence Awards]], and in 2005, the magazine named IDEO one of the twenty most innovative companies in the world.&lt;ref name="Kelly"&gt;Kelly, Tom. About IDEO. 2005. http://www.tenfacesofinnovation.com/ideo/index.htm (accessed 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

As Tom Kelly stated in The Ten Faces of Innovation, "IDEO creates innovative products, services, spaces , and experiences for companies such as [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[Pepsi]]-Cola, and Samsung. IDEO also helps companies build cultures of innovation. Successful designs include Apple mouse, first [[Laptop|laptop computer]], Polaroid I-Zone [[instant camera]], Palm V, soft-handled Gripper toothbrush for [[Oral-B]], and hundreds of other standard-setting designs."&lt;ref name="Kelly"/&gt;

According to Andrew Hargadon and Robert Sutton’s study of IDEO, "IDEO’s clients, ranging from Fortune 50 companies to start-ups, typically hire the firm to design part or all of a product." "Clients are usually charged for the time and materials required in designing a product but they occasionally work in exchange for a percentage of sales or profits from the finished product. Design projects last from a few weeks to three years, with an average of about a year. Results range from sketches of product concepts to crude working models to complete new product designs."&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

Most designers at IDEO are 25 to 40 years old, male (about 80 percent), white (about 80 percent), and usually have a B.S. or an M.S. in engineering. Managers have a similar profile but tend to be older (35 to 50 years old). The support staff also has a similar profile to the designers, but with a larger proportion (approximately 50 percent) of women.&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt; Tim Brown believes a good design thinker possesses the following characteristics: empathy integrative thinking, optimism, experimentalism and collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Tim. "Thinking." [[Harvard Business Review]], 2008: 85-92.&lt;/ref&gt;

IDEO’s organizational structure provides great support for technology brokering. The design operations at IDEO force individual designers to face a continual flow of new problems which require engineering solutions. This flow of new problems provides incentives and opportunities for them to develop and exploit a wide-ranging knowledge of potential solutions.&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

Within the organization, the engineers do not specialize in any single field, but frequently move to a different industry after completing a project for a company. Engineers also often transfer on and off of long-term projects to prevent ‘burn-out’, this allows them to pursue interests in other areas. This movement between teams and projects not only provides designers with a wide range of experiences, it exposes them to the skills and backgrounds of their colleagues.&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

'''IBO Group'''

[http://ibo-group.co.il IBO Group], with their high Technology [[knowledge transfer]], assist organizations that want to take advantage of the most cutting-edge technology leading by Israel innovation. its founder Itay Tawili has more than 10 years of experience as Information Technology Manager and System Administrator. with his knowledge and IBO [[Business networking|networking]], IBO assist its partners to achieve the exact solution that will suit their needs and issues. by using [[empathic design]] process technique, IBO providing to its decision-Making Executive Leadership partners effective knowledge for them to decide their [[technology strategy]], and achieve their business goals.

'''Menlo Park'''

Thomas Edison was an inventor, a business man, and most importantly an innovator. In 1875 Edison purchased a single model home in New Jersey. This property is referred to as one of his first major innovations; the first industrial research lab, "Menlo Park." This would be the location of over 400 inventions and prove to be a prime example of Thomas Edison using technology brokering to innovate. Edison has stated that he built this laboratory for the; "Rapid and cheap development of an invention." He also promised, "A minor invention every ten days and a major invention every six months."&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|3}} How could Edison make such bold projections? Edison developed four intertwined work practices that helped him be so innovative. They were: capturing good ideas, keeping these ideas alive, imagining new uses for old ideas, and putting promising concepts to test. Using these concepts, which underline the concepts of technology brokering, Edison is credited with 1,093 U.S. patents as well as patents in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.&lt;ref name="Hargadon"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

One of the reasons Edison was so successful was his ability to surround himself with very knowledgeable people. Edison’s team came from all over the world and they were considered experts in various fields. [[Charles Batchelor]], from England, was Edison’s chief mechanical assistant and helped Edison with many of his inventions. Edison also hired people from Germany, Switzerland, and a number of other European countries.&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

In an article written by Andrew Hargadon, he states, "Between the years of 1876 to 1881, the lab (Menlo park) produced numerous innovations in high speed, automatic and repeating, telegraphs; telephones; phonographs; generators, voltmeters; light bulbs; and vacuum pumps." Edison’s first major financial success was the quadruplex telegraph. After creating the quadruplex Edison was unsure how to set the price. He originally thought his product could sell for somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000. After he pitched his product to [[Western Union]], Edison was thrilled to see they offered him $10,000 for the telegraph. This financial success allowed Edison to be the founder of the first institution set up with the specific purpose of producing constant technological innovation and improvement, Menlo Park.

It is recognized that Edison understood the concept of technology brokering. And some of his methods were rather elementary. In his own notes it stated, "1st Study the present construction, 2nd Ask for all past experiences…study and read everything you can on the subject."

==Products==
The desire of technology brokers to work with old/discontinued, or already in use products/ideas, has provided an array of fascinating products. For instance, obesity has been a problem for years and many people have gone through endless treatments; however, the craving for food that is high in fat and sugar does not go away. IDEO designed a Crave Aid Patch, similar to the [[Nicotine patch|Nicotine Patch]] used to quit smoking. This patch comes in different flavors of unhealthy food, so that when an individual is craving unhealthy food he/she can wear this patch and fight the hunger.&lt;ref&gt;"Crave Aid Concept," IDEO, http://ideo.com/work/item/crave-aid-concept (accessed April 28, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another excellent example of technology brokering is the telephone. Since it was invented, the telephone has undergone a great number of changes: from residential-only, to being portable in a brief case, to more modernized digital [[Mobile phone|cell phones]] with access to internet and much more. It seemed as though the residential phone would disappear completely due to the technology found in the cellular phones; however, technology brokering was able to bring about a huge change in residential phones. [[Verizon Communications|Verizon communications]] recently introduced the Verizon Hub, a residential phone that allows you to send and receive text-messages, pictures, connect to the internet, and link your cell phone to your Verizon Hub so you can answer your home phone even if not at home.&lt;ref&gt;June, laura . "Engadget ." 23 January 2009. https://www.engadget.com/2009/01/23/verizon-hub-landline-slayer-officially-unveiled/ (accessed 29 April 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

The beauty of technology brokering is not inventing totally new products, it is the ability to reimage or recreate a product while using an old idea/product. For example, the Craving Aid Patch was a product originally designed for smokers and in many cases seen as a medical procedure. Nonetheless, exactly the same idea has now been used to create a totally different product using the same technology. Similar to the Craving Aid Patch, which is just an old idea reinvented into a new product, the Verizon Hub, perhaps the most modern residential phone, is based on the very same idea as when it was first invented, in the years of [[Alexander Graham Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;"Crave Aid Patch." 2005.http://ideo.com/work/item/crave-aid-concept (accessed 29 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology Brokering can make an impact on any kind of product regardless of its nature. For example, a bar tap handle could be pretty much anything, a stick or piece of metal, a button, etc. However, with the help of IDEO, Sam Adams was able to innovate its bar tap handles. The totally redesigned Sam Adams tap continues to have a similar shape as the others, but Sam Adams’ has a blue fluorescent cover displaying the Sam Adams brand while giving a sense of the elegance and class behind the Sam Adams brand.&lt;ref&gt;"Sam Adams Bar Tap Handle." 2004.http://ideo.com/work/item/samuel-adams-tap-handle (accessed 29 April 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Light Bulb'''

On December 31, 1879, Edison first displayed his most popular invention. It was the first "practical incandescent, electric lamp. This is a perfect example of Thomas Edison leveraging technology brokering. Edison was not the first person to invent electric light. J.W. Starr filed a patent for an incandescent bulb in 1854. That was 30 years before Edison began working on the light bulb we know today. When Edison first started testing incandescent lamps, the arc light was being used for lighting streets and also for various other applications.

When Edison began testing incandescent lamps he ran into a major problem. The problem was Edison wasn’t sure what material to use for the filament. Most of the material he tried would melt. There was too much oxygen and heat created by the electric current. As a result the filaments would always burn. He used two methods to correct this issue. At first Edison had to find a new material to use. He began by using platinum for his filaments with little success. Eventually he made his filaments by carbonizing [[Bristol board]], which is a type of cardboard. He also acquired the best vacuum pumps available at the time. This would reduce the amount of oxygen inside of the bulbs. These two changes made it possible for Edison to create the light bulb we all use today.

As mentioned above, Edison did not invent the electric light. However, he did leverage technology brokering in order to piece together many different existing technologies to make a better light bulb. As one could assume, Edison was highly appraised for his accomplishments. Many people today believe he was the first person to invent the electric light when truly he was great at leveraging technology brokering.

==Process model==
'''•	Step1: Access'''
According to Andrew Hargadon and Robert Sutton’s study of IDEO, "IDEO has access to dissimilar industries and it enables them to generate product innovations." "Each engineer has a distinct body of technological knowledge from working with IDEO clients, from past technical training and work experience, and from his or her personal interests and backgrounds. The role this diverse knowledge plays in creating new products is evident in a description of how one designer's personal background was the source of new solutions." "IDEO's Methodology Handbook recommends that designers look for opportunities to expand IDEO's network and/or industry knowledge. "IDEO's contact with different technologies comes through the individual engineer’s contact with the industries where those technologies are used."&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

'''•	Step 2: Acquisition'''
According to Andrew Hargadon and Robert Sutton’s study of IDEO, "Expertise in acquiring new knowledge helps IDEO designers to understand and work with a client's existing technologies." "This ongoing process of learning from clients started in IDEO's early days and remains part of all projects." "IDEO's Methodology Handbook states that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"As consultants we need to quickly become experts in the client's product area. We want to acclimate ourselves to the market, the buzz words, the competition. We need to orient ourselves to the major pitfalls, alternatives, and opportunities."&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"IDEO engineers also acquire knowledge by studying an industry's existing products because they serve as records of the technologies in that industry."&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

'''•	Step 3: Storage'''
According to Andrew Hargadon and Robert Sutton’s study of IDEO, there are "two types of routines at IDEO for storing potential technological solutions." Routines for storing specific knowledge "place potential solutions in the memories of individual designers and objects and products that designers collected from their previous work." Routines for maintaining and refreshing that knowledge include "displaying objects where other designers can see them and constant conversations that designers have about who has what design knowledge."&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;
"Upper-level managers often direct designers to individuals with relevant expertise by knowing who had worked previously on what projects."&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

'''•	Step 4: Retrieval'''
According to Andrew Hargadon and Robert Sutton’s study of IDEO, "at IDEO, retrieval entails bringing stored knowledge of potentially valuable technological solutions to bear on the design problems of current projects." IDEO designers retrieve technological solutions through "analogical thinking" and through "established routines for sharing the problems of current design projects with other designers in the organization who have relevant and potentially valuable knowledge." "Potential solutions are drawn from IDEO's organizational memory at brainstorming sessions and company-wide Monday morning meetings." "Retrieval also occurs during informal conversations that follow meetings or e-mails", which are facilitated by IDEO's "open office plan" and encounters with other designers.&lt;ref name="Hargadon_Sutton"/&gt;

'''Thomas Birch''' (1779 &amp;ndash; January 3, 1851), was an English-born American portrait and marine painter.

Birch was born in [[London]], England.  He came to the U. S. in 1794, and assisted his artist father, [[William Birch (painter)|William Birch]], in preparing a 29-plate collection of engravings:''[[Birch's Views of Philadelphia]]'' (1800).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/birch/index.htm Birch's Views] from ushistory.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Subscribers to the series included President [[John Adams]] and Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref&gt;William Birch, ''The City of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania as It Appeared in the Year 1800'', (1799), endpiece.&lt;/ref&gt; This sold well and went into multiple editions, inspiring similar collected views of [[New York City]], and of suburban estates surrounding Philadelphia and [[Baltimore]]. The son's first major painting appears to have been a view of Philadelphia from the Treaty Elm in Kensington, which was also engraved and published in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Munsing, ''Philadelphia: Three Centuries'', p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; He painted portraits until about 1807, when he took up marine-painting. Some of his most famous works depict naval battles of the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Universal Cyclopædia &amp; Atlas]]'', 1902, New York, D. Appleton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Birch was the first American ship portraitist, and his paintings were copied by countless artists and craftsmen in America and Europe."&lt;ref&gt;Munsing, ''Philadelphia: Three Centuries'', p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to ships, they provide valuable images of bridges, lighthouses, docksides, and harbor fortifications in the Early Republic, especially those surrounding New York City and Philadelphia. His paintings of suburban mansions and rural snow scenes were often turned into engravings.

Historically, the Birches' most important work may be a circa-1801 engraving documenting the unfinished [[U.S. Capitol]]. Another, may be the son's painting depicting an 1812 [[Engagement between the United States and the Macedonian|naval battle between USS ''United States'' and HMS ''Macedonian'']], that hung in the [[Oval Office]] of [[U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]. It was sold at auction in 2008, setting a record price for the artist of $481,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159437341 ''USS United States vs. HMS Macedonian'' (1813)] from Sotheby's Auction, 22 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

An assessment from 1867:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Marine landscapes were painted thirty years ago by an Englishman in Philadelphia &amp;mdash; Thomas Birch. The freshness of his atmosphere and clearly-painted waves were a marked feature. His delineation of the engagement between the U.S. frigate ''Constitution'' and the British frigate ''Guerriere'', and that between the ''United States'' and the ''Macedonian'' &amp;mdash; each four by two feet six inches &amp;mdash; are fine specimens of this artist, and of rare historical value.''&lt;ref&gt;Henry T. Tuckerman, ''Book of the Artists'', (New York, 1867), p. 551.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He exhibited regularly at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] for forty years, beginning in 1811, and managed the museum, 1812-17.&lt;ref&gt;Gerdts, Philadelphia Maritime Museum, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; His work is collected at [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts|PAFA]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pafa.org/Museum/The-Collection/View-All-Works/Artist/Collection-by-Artist/119/let__B/artistId__2592/ PAFA] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905162353/http://www.pafa.org/Museum/The-Collection/View-All-Works/Artist/Collection-by-Artist/119/let__B/artistId__2592/ |date=2012-09-05 }}; accessed January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Library Company of Philadelphia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.librarycompany.org/artifacts/painters.htm LCP]; accessed January 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/222880.html?mulR=4754 PMA]; accessed January 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/search/search_artworks1.cfm?StartRow=1&amp;ConID=6253&amp;format=short&amp;db=onlyart&amp;LastName=&amp;FirstName=&amp;Title=&amp;Accession=&amp;Keyword= si.edu]; accessed January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the [[U.S. Naval Academy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/photos/images/kn10000/kn10953.jpg USNA]; accessed January 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true&amp;id=258990&amp;coll_keywords=&amp;coll_accession=&amp;coll_name=&amp;coll_artist=Thomas+Birch&amp;coll_place=&amp;coll_medium=&amp;coll_culture=&amp;coll_classification=Watercolors&amp;coll_credit=&amp;coll_provenance=&amp;coll_location=&amp;coll_has_images=1&amp;coll_on_view=&amp;coll_sort=0&amp;coll_sort_order=0&amp;coll_view=0&amp;coll_package=0&amp;coll_start=1 mfa.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224100213/http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true |date=2007-02-24 }}; accessed January 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; among others. In 1833, he was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Honorary member. He died in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

'''''Ut pictura poesis''''' is a [[Latin]] phrase literally meaning "as is [[painting]] so is [[poetry]]". The statement (often repeated) occurs most famously in [[Horace]]'s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'', near the end, immediately after another famous quotation, "bonus dormitat Homerus", or "[[Homeric nod|even Homer nods]]" (an indication that even the most skilled poet can compose inferior verse):
:Poetry resembles painting. Some works will captivate you when you stand very close to them and others if you are at a greater distance. This one prefers a darker vantage point, that one wants to be seen in the light since it feels no terror before the penetrating judgment of the critic. This pleases only once, that will give pleasure even if we go back to it ten times over. (Quoting from English translation.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Horace|last=Golden|first=Leon|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4051-5540-3|editor-last=Davis|editor-first=Gregson|location=Oxford, UK|pages=400|chapter=Reception of Horace's Ars Poetica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horace meant that poetry (in its widest sense, "imaginative texts") merited the same careful interpretation that was, in Horace's day, reserved for painting.

Some centuries before [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides of Keos]]( c. 556 – 468 BC) had stated, "Poema pictura loquens, pictura poema silens," which translates into, "Poetry is a speaking picture, painting a silent poetry."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88/utpict.html.|title=Ut Pictura Poesis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, as this phrase has traversed history, it has ignited academic arguments over whether or not it is true. [[Plato]], through his own thought process on credible knowledge, found painting and writing to be unreliable sources of understanding so disregarded the whole concept entirely. The lack of credibility rested on his opinion that both forms of art gave a false simulation of reality. Moving on from Plato's time to the Renaissance, the argument sprung up of which form was superior. It was decided, at this time, painting took precedence because sight was higher ranking to people than hearing was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csmt.uchicago.edu/gloassary/2004/utpicturapoesis.htm|title=Ut Pictura Poesis|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] opens his ''[[Laocoön|Laocoön: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry]]'' (1766){{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} by observing that "the first who compared painting with poetry &amp;#91;[[Simonides of Ceos]]&amp;#93; was a man of fine feeling,"&lt;ref&gt;Simonides, who wrote "poema pictura locguens, pictura poema silens" (poetry is a speaking picture, painting a silent [mute] poetry) was quoted by [[Plutarch]], ''De gloria Atheniensium'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0234%3Astephpage%3D346f 3.346f].&lt;/ref&gt; though, Lessing makes it clear, not a critic or philosopher. Lessing argues that painting is a synchronic, visual phenomenon, one of space that is immediately in its entirety understood and appreciated, while poetry (again, in its widest sense) is a diachronic art of the ear, one that depends on time to unfold itself for the reader's appreciation. He recommends that poetry and painting should not be confused, and that they are best practiced and appreciated "as two equitable and friendly neighbors."{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

[[W. J. T. Mitchell]] trenchantly observed that "We tend to think that to compare poetry with painting is to make a [[metaphor]], while to differentiate poetry from painting is to state a literal truth."&lt;ref&gt;Iconology: Image, Text, Ideology (University of Chicago Press, 1986) page 49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alexander Pope ==
18th-century British poet [[Alexander Pope]] was partial to ''ut pictura poesis.'' He considered both painting and poetry to be equals, and "it can easily be seen that he held that there was a close relationship between the art of poetry and the art of painting, especially perhaps since such a relationship combined the two arts of which he was a practitioner."&lt;ref name="williams 61 75"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Robert W.|date=1983-1984|title=Alexander Pope and Ut Pictura Poesis|url=https://openjournals.library.sydney.edu.au/index.php/SSE/article/view/396/365|journal=Sydney Studies in English|volume=9|pages=61–75|via=MLA International Bibliography}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is note of Pope finding himself "in a larger context of a continuous line of poetic pictorialism."&lt;ref name="williams 61 75"/&gt; ''Ut pictura poesis'' surfaces in regards to Pope's [[The Rape of the Lock|"Rape of the Lock"]] through his in-depth descriptions of the characters and plot. Rebecca Ferguson, in her essay "'Quick as her Eyes, and as unfix'd as those': objectification and seeing in Pope's "Rape of the Lock", draws attention to these details, specifically with Belinda’s character. Ferguson explains an aspect of how Pope was painting a character and a plot: "Pope's construction of Belinda seems to render her just such a 'frontier' between a constructive and a destructive chaos, between qualities which are 'neither inside nor outside', neither invested in her 'essential' self nor in her body," and

&lt;blockquote&gt;The belle is identified in many ways with the display of vessels and treasures around her, both as a consumer and as a figure who takes on some of the properties of those riches, yet her attractions are in the end not so much displayed as set in motion; she 'rises in her charms', 'awakens' and 'calls forth' her wonders and graces, culminating in the dispersal of both her body and her allure in the reader's eye. (Ferguson)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Rebecca|date=1992|title=Quick as her Eyes, and as unfix’d as those’: objectification and seeing in  Pope’s "Rape of the Lock"|url=|journal=Critical Survey|volume=4|pages=14–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is an emphasis on the reader's eye and the imagery that contributed to audience members being able to so vividly 'watch' the plot of this poem unfold.

Vivid LIVE has also seen Australian premieres and exclusive performances from the likes of Ms. [[Lauryn Hill]] (2014); [[Amon Tobin]]’s [[ISAM (album)|ISAM]] (2012); [[Chris Cunningham]] (2011); [[Bat For Lashes]] (2011); The [[Gurrumul]] Project (2013) and the late [[Bobby Womack]] (2013). Most notably, it has showcased a series of emerging artists who have since established themselves at the forefront of contemporary music—including [[Nils Frahm]] (2014), [[St. Vincent (musician)|St Vincent]] (2014), [[Danny Brown (rapper)|Danny Brown]] (2013), [[Flume (musician)|Flume]] (2009) and [[Jon Hopkins]] (2009).

Vivid LIVE was the winner of the [[Helpmann Awards|Helpmann Award]] for [[15th_Helpmann_Awards#Contemporary_Music|Best Contemporary Music Festival]] in 2015.

In 2018 the festival will celebrate its tenth anniversary.

== History ==
In its inaugural incarnation, '''Luminous''', the festival was curated by [[Brian Eno]] whose aim was to produce a truly eclectic lineup: "people who work in the new territories, the places in between, the places out at the edges."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vivid presents Luminous Festival @ Sydney Opera House|url=http://www.liveguide.com.au/Events/624526/Brian_Enos_77_Million_Paintings_Battles_Ladytron_Jon_Hassell_and_Maarifa_Street_Reggie_Watts_Jon/Vivid_presents_Luminous_Festival|website=Live Guide|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts included New York city's experimental rock group [[Battles]], trumpet player and composer [[Jon Hassell]], and comedian/musician [[Reggie Watts]].

In 2010, the late [[Lou Reed]] and his wife [[Laurie Anderson]] realised their artistic vision by performing works of their own, with Reed's Metal Machine Trio and Anderson's ''Transitory Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laurie Anderson and Lou Reed reveal the first part of their Vivid LIVE at Sydney Opera House program|url=http://www.sydneyoperahouse.com/About/10EventMediaRelease_VividLIVEFirstProgram.aspx|website=Sydney Opera House|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2011 saw the Sydney-based music promoter and founder of [[Modular Recordings]] [[Steve Pavlovic]] program the likes of [[The Cure]], video artist [[Chris Cunningham]] and psychedelic rock project [[Tame Impala]]. The Studio venue was also transformed into a club space for the first time with parties curated by [[The Avalanches]], [[Mad Racket]] featuring [[Gavin Russom]]’s The Crystal Ark and [[2manydjs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Divola|first1=Barry|title=Bright light|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/about-town/bright-light-20110527-1f83c.html|accessdate=30 October 2014|work=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Sydney Opera House]] took the programming of the festival into its own hands, reflecting the rising status of contemporary music at the performing arts centre. [[Fergus Lineham]], the Head of Contemporary Music at the time, said the change was necessary to facilitate the ambitious nature of the festival: "there was such a time commitment and a geographical challenge that it meant we ended up with a lot of people who would have loved to do something but wouldn't do the whole thing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zuel|first1=Bernard|title=Time to face the music: changes leave Vivid confident of bright future|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/about-town/time-to-face-the-music-changes-leave-vivid-confident-of-bright-future-20120228-1u0re.html#ixzz3HafroVWG|accessdate=30 October 2014|agency=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lineup included [[Sufjan Stevens]], [[Florence + the Machine]] and the Ceremonial Orchestra, and the Australian premiere of [[Shut Up and Play the Hits]]—a documentary recounting the lead up to [[LCD Soundsystem]]'s final performance. [[Karen O]] also appeared in the Australian debut of her "psycho-opera" ''Stop the Virgens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Purcell|first1=Andrew|title=The evolution of Karen O|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/the-evolution-of-karen-o-20120519-1ywvk.html|accessdate=15 November 2014|agency=Sydney Morning Herald|date=20 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Ben Marshall, Head of Contemporary Music at [[Sydney Opera House]], presented his first Vivid LIVE line up — one that he described as "a celebration of unique individuals' voices".&lt;ref name="2/04/2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vivid LIVE - Curator|url=http://vividlive.sydneyoperahouse.com/curator/|website=Sydney Opera House}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a first for contemporary music at the Opera House, Sydney label [[Future Classic]] presented concerts on the Northern Broadwalk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3398">The '''Wynn Newhouse Award''' is an annual prize given to disabled artists in recognition of their artistic merit.&lt;ref&gt;http://wnewhouseawards.com/Pages/About.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Samuel I. Newhouse Foundation, a charitable organization founded by newspaper entrepreneur [[Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr.]], inaugurated the award in 2006 at the suggestion of the late Wynn Newhouse, to draw attention to the contributions of [[artist]]s with [[disability|disabilities]] to [[contemporary art]].&lt;ref&gt;''Art in America'', May 2007; http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_5_95/ai_n25439083/&lt;/ref&gt; Wynn Newhouse, himself disabled, was a prominent [[New York City]] art collector and grandson of the newspaper magnate.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, Jul 4, 1989. p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recipients==
Recipients share an annual award totaling $60,000, allocated by the judges. The selection committee changes each year. It is made up of four prominent members of the arts community including artists, curators and critics.

To be eligible for the Wynn Newhouse Awards, nominees must be artists of professional standing, and have a disability as recognized by the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]]. The awards are made in late December of each year.

In addition to the grants, many winning artists are offered an exhibition at the Palitz Gallery, a gallery space on East 61st Street in New York City. This exhibition is donated by Syracuse University in their Lubin Center in New York. An annual reception for winners attracts many persons in the arts community.  

The Wynn Newhouse Awards will be offered through 2016. They are currently coordinated by consultant Bill Butler of Alford, MA and by artist Gordon Sasaki of New York. Information can be obtained and artists can be
suggested via the website wnewhouseawards.com
