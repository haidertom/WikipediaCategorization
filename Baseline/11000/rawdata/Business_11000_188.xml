'''Jean-Antoine Auguste Metz''' (8 August 1812 – 22 June 1854) was a [[Luxembourg]]ian entrepreneur, politician, and lawyer.  He was a major player in the growing steel industry in Luxembourg during the nineteenth century, as well as a leading [[classical liberalism|liberal]] member of the [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]], along with his brothers.

Born in [[Luxembourg City]] as the youngest of nine children of Jean Metz, Auguste Metz attended the [[Athénée de Luxembourg]], before leaving to study law at the [[University of Paris]] in 1833.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 549&lt;/ref&gt;  He gained his licence to practice law in France, but returned to Luxembourg, where he became involved in the [[steel industry]].  In 1837, Metz and his brothers [[Charles Metz|Charles]] and [[Norbert Metz|Norbert]], were given a ten-year lease of the steel mill at [[Berbourg]].  They formed a company, ''Auguste Metz &amp; Cie'', along with [[Théodore Pescatore]], for the purpose of expanding and redeveloping the site.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 550&lt;/ref&gt;  The company expanded, taking over foundries at [[Grundhof, Luxembourg|Grundhof]],&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 553&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Red Lands]],&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Eich, Luxembourg|Eich]],&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 557&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Fischbach, Mersch|Fischbach]].&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 563&lt;/ref&gt;

He first became involved in politics through his opposition to the [[Third Partition of Luxembourg]] in 1839.&lt;ref  name="Metz 564"&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 564&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1848, Metz sat on Luxembourg's [[Constituent Assembly of Luxembourg|Constituent Assembly]], and then the first [[Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg|Chamber of Deputies]], [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1848|elected in 1848]] to represent [[Grevenmacher (Chamber of Deputies of Luxembourg constituency)|Grevenmacher]].&lt;ref name="Metz 564" /&gt;  He was targeted in the [[Luxembourgian legislative election, 1854|1854 election]] by the [[Charles-Mathias Simons|Simons]] government.&lt;ref name="Metz 565"&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 565&lt;/ref&gt;  He would not live to see the assembly of the new Chamber of Deputies, however, as he died in Eich just eight days after the election, having fallen ill inspecting the foundry at Berbourg, exacerbated by [[tonsillitis]].&lt;ref name="Metz 565" /&gt;

He married Petronille Laeis on 17 August 1841.  They had four children, including [[Léon Metz]], who became a member of the Chamber of Deputies for forty-three years and [[Mayor of Esch-sur-Alzette]] for three years.&lt;ref&gt;Mersch (1963), p. 399&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Australian Market and Social Research Society Limited''' (AMSRS) is a professional membership body which represents approximately 2,100 [[market research]] professionals who are committed to strengthening the standards and awareness of both market and [[social research]] in Australia. AMSRS states that its principal aims are to improve professional standards and ethics in the fields of marketing and social research and to assist members in career development

The AMSRS is the peak representative body for individual market and social research professionals while the Association of Market and Social Research Organisations (AMSRO) is the peak representative body for market and social research organisations in Australia. Together, the two peak societies represent the Australian industry and work to promote understanding of market and social research, help set and maintain the highest ethical and technical standards as well as representing the industry's regulatory and legislative interests. The AMSRS works closely with the Association of Market and Social Research Organisations (AMSRO).

==Overview==

According to the Asia-Pacific Regional Committee, the Australian Market Research Society (AMSRS) is the peak industry body representing market research professionals in Australia. &lt;ref&gt;''Quirk's Directory'', Australian Associations, http://www.quirks.com/directories/association/australian-market-and-social-research-society-amsrs&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary role is to improve professional standards and ethics within the industry. It provides training and professional development services to members, and it also offers services to the public, including a 1300 phone line, allowing interested members of the public to check the bona fides of market research companies. The AMSRS has an active publishing arm and publishes a number of regular publications including the monthly practitioners' magazine, ''Research News'', the peer-reviewed academic journal, ''Market and Social Research'' (formerly ''AJMSR'') and an annual industry directory, the ''AMSRS Yearbook and Directory'' and occasional publications such as the ''Statistics E-Book.'' The society also has a commitment to improving the public image of the market research industry in general.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, P., "Are We the Kid in the Corner in the Corner with no Friends?" ''Research News'', Vol 26, No 8, 2009, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Most professional associations globally, place a high value on member accreditation, by examining knowledge and evaluating professional practice.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J., "The Role of Professional Associations", ''Library Trends,'' Vol. 46, No. 2, 1997 [University of Illinois]&lt;/ref&gt; The AMSRS is no exception. To that end, the AMSRS administers the industry-based professional accreditation program, known as the Qualified Practitioner of Market Research (QPMR), designed to ensure that practitioners maintain their experience and regularly update their knowledge. Some industry practitioners have noted that consultants with QPMR accreditation generally have more experience.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Harris, "A Penny for Your Thoughts," ''Marketing Magazine'', 3 December 2008; Online: https://www.marketingmag.com.au/hubs-c/apennyforyourthoughts/&lt;/ref&gt; The AMSRS holds an annual conference designed to allow members to exchange ideas and propose new research methodologies and for which ''Conference Proceedings'' are also published annually.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Pacific Research Committee- Member Associations, &lt;Online: http://aprc-research.com/member-associations/amsrs-australia&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Academics and practitioners have noted that the theme of ''knowledge'' pervades the AMSRS Conferences.&lt;ref&gt;Wee, T.T.T., "The Use of Marketing Research and Intelligence in Strategic Planning: Key Issues and Future Trends", ''Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning,'' Vol. 19 Issue: 4, 2007, pp. 245–253&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="AMSRS"&gt;Australian Market and Social Research Society, http://www.amsrs.com.au; retrieved April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The AMSRS works closely with the Association of Market and Social Research Organisations (AMSRO).&lt;ref name="AMSRS" /&gt;

(2009), "Pseudo-scientific hokus pokus: motivational research's Australian application", ''Journal of Historical Research in Marketing,'' Vol. 1 No. 2, pp. 224–245.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[AC Nielsen]] opened an Australian office in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, "Celebrating 90 Years," Online: http://sites.nielsen.com/90years&lt;/ref&gt;

The market research industry matured in the post-war years as research practitioners tapped into sophisticated scientific methods; statistics, probability sampling and the emergence of predictive statistics in polling. Market researchers, themselves, contributed to methodological advances, devising experimental techniques for measuring radio and television audiences&lt;ref&gt;Trudinger, ''The Comfort of Men: A Critical History of Managerial and Professional Men in Post-war Modernisation, 1945–1965,'' PhD Dissertation, University of Sydney, Australia, 2004, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; and began to explore new qualitative research techniques such as motivational research.&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, A., "Pseudo-scientific hokus pokus: motivational research's Australian application", ''Journal of Historical Research in Marketing,'' Vol. 1 No. 2, 2009, pp. 226–229.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this climate that the market research industry began to position itself as a distinct discipline, separate from general marketing, and began to form its own dedicated professional associations.&lt;ref&gt;Trudinger, ''The Comfort of Men: A Critical History of Managerial and Professional Men in Post-war Modernisation, 1945–1965,'' PhD Dissertation, University of Sydney, Australia, 2004, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

The Market Research Society of Victoria was founded in August 1955 and it evolved into the national organisation in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;"Researcher Named in Australian Honours," 14 June 2016, &lt;online: http://www.researchnewslive.com.au/2016/06/14/researcher-named-in-australian-government-honours&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Following the formation of a New South Wales division in 1959, a Federal Council was established to coordinate the activities of the two states and the Society's name was changed to the Market Research Society of Australia (MRSA) to reflect its broader geographic coverage. Branches were formed in other Australian states; including South Australia (1960), Western Australia (1969) and Queensland (1975). The first ''Code of Professional Behaviour'' was adopted in 1963&lt;ref&gt;Mike Larbalestier, "A History of Market Research," in Malhotra, N., ''Marketing Research: An Applied Orientation'', [Appendix 1a], Sydney, Pearson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia's first text book dedicated to market research, ''Introduction to Market Analysis,'' was published by the Market Research Society of Australia (Victorian Division) in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Bottomley, D., ''Introduction to Market Analysis,'' Market Research Society of Australia, Victorian Division, Melbourne, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The society changed its name from the Market Research Society of Australia (MRSA) to the Australian Social and Market Research Society (AMSRS) in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Larbalestier, "A History of Market Research," AMSRS, Online: https://www.amsrs.com.au/about/history-of-market-research-in-australia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership ==

The Australian Market and Social Research Society (AMSRS) has 2,100 individual professional researchers as members. Its partner organisation, the Association of Market and Social Research Organisations (AMSRO) which represents market and social research organisations, has 90 member organisations, accounting for approximately 75 per cent of the industry's employment. The market research industry turns over approximately $750 million annually and employs more than 10,000 equivalent full-time personnel (EFTs) in Australia, including 4,100 full-time professionals.&lt;ref&gt;AMSRO and AMSRS, ''Submission to the Australian Government'', Submission to Numbering: Structure of Australia's Telephone Numbering Plan Consultation Paper No. 1, [Joint Submission on IFC362010 to the Australian Government], 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the AMSRS and AMSRO commenced negotiations to merge the two organisations, allowing the industry to speak with a 'single voice'.&lt;ref&gt;AMSRS, Newsletter, 9 September, 2106, Online: http://amsrslive.com.au/2016/09/09/amsrs-and-amsro-proposed-merger-update/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code of professional behaviour==

AMSRS members are bound to observe the AMSRS' ''Code of Professional Behaviour'', which provides an ethical framework for both conducting and reporting market and social research. In Australia, the market and social research industry operates under a co-regulatory system in which the peak industry body or bodies, such as ASMRS and AMSRO, develop codes of behaviour that are subsequently ratified by government, after which time, they become binding on all industry members.&lt;ref&gt;Schiffman,L., O'Cass, A., Paladino, A. and Carlson, J., ''Consumer Behaviour'', French's Forest, NSW, 2014, p.581&lt;/ref&gt; The AMSRS code of professional behaviour is designed to ensure that strict standards of ethical and professional conduct are upheld. Both the AMSRO and AMSRS are empowered to investigate complaints, relating to breaches of the code, and can apply sanctions.

Members of AMSRS are bound by the following codes:&lt;ref&gt;Research Industry Council of Australia, ''Fact Sheet'', Online: http://www.rica.com.au/rica3623site/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/AMSRS-Media-Factsheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

:: The Code of Professional Behaviour.
:: The Australian Standard for market, opinion and social research (ISO 20252).
:: The Quality Standard for Online Access Panels (QSOAP).
:: The Qualified Practicing Market Researcher scheme (QPMR).
:: The Privacy (Market and Social Research) Code, 2014.

The Australian government, commenting on the Australian Privacy (Market and Social Research) Code, 2014, developed by the AMSRS, noted that it was far stricter than the government's own privacy laws.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government, Office of the Information Commissioner, ''Privacy (Market and Social Research) Code 2014'', Online: https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy-law/privacy-registers/privacy-codes/privacy-market-and-social-research-code-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industry standards==

The AMSRS has been instrumental in developing internationally recognised standards for conducting and reporting market and social research. For example, the Quality Standard for On-line Access Panels (QSOAP) was an initiative of both the Association of Market and Social Research Organisations (AMSRO) and the Australian Market and Social Research Society (AMSRS) and is now recognised as world's best practice quality standard for online research.&lt;ref&gt;''Marketing Magazine'', 7 August 2008 https://www.marketingmag.com.au/news-c/australiasetstheworldstandardforonlineresearchpractices/&lt;/ref&gt;

The AS [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standard [[ISO 20252|20252]], was published worldwide in 2006 as the model for market, opinion and social research in the market research industry. The standard was published in Australia in 2007 and AS ISO 20252 has been adopted by AMSRS as the Australian Standard for Market and Social Marketing Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrqa.com.au/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106152843/http://www.mrqa.com.au/index.html |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }} Australian Market and Social Research Standard AS ISO 20252&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bankruptcy]] is a legally declared inability or impairment of ability of an individual or organization to pay their [[creditor]]s. In most cases [[personal bankruptcy]] is initiated by the bankrupt individual.  Bankruptcy is a legal process that discharges most debts, but has the disadvantage of making it more difficult for an individual to borrow in the future.  To avoid the negative impacts of personal bankruptcy, individuals in debt have a number of '''bankruptcy alternatives'''.

== Take no action ==

Bankruptcy prevents a person's creditors from obtaining a [[Legal judgment|judgment]] against them.  With a judgment a [[creditor]] can attempt to [[garnishment|garnish]] wages or seize certain types of property.  However, if a [[debtor]] has no wages (because they are [[Unemployment|unemployed]] or [[Retirement|retired]]) and has no property, they are "[[judgment proof]]", meaning a judgment would have no impact on their financial situation.  Creditors typically do not initiate legal action against a debtor with no assets, because it is unlikely they could collect the judgment.

If enough time passes, seven years in most jurisdictions, the debt is removed from the debtor's [[credit history]].

A [[debtor]] with no assets or income cannot be garnished by a [[creditor]], and therefore the "Take No Action" approach may be the correct option, particularly if the debtor does not expect to have a steady income or property a creditor could attempt to seize.

==Self money management==

[[Debt]] is a result of spending more than one's income in a given period.  To reduce debt, the most obvious solution is to reduce monthly spending to allow extra cash flow to service debt.  This can be done by creating a [[personal budget]] and analyzing expenses to find areas to reduce expenses.

Most people, when reviewing a written list of their monthly expenses, can find ways to reduce expenses.  Common areas for expense reduction would include reducing food expenses by eating out less often, taking public transportation instead of driving a car, and eliminating enhanced telephone and cable television services.

== Negotiate with creditors ==

Creditors understand that [[bankruptcy]] is an option for debtors with excessive debt, so most creditors are willing to negotiate a settlement so that they receive a portion of their money, instead of risking losing everything in a bankruptcy.

Negotiation is a viable alternative if the debtor has sufficient income, or has assets that can be liquidated so that the proceeds can be applied against the debt.  Negotiation may also buy the debtor some time to rebuild their finances.

For a business, a restructuring agreed with the creditors is a common approach but this requires the agreement of all creditors.&lt;ref name="EkvallSmiley2007"&gt;{{citation|author1=Lei Lei Ekvall|author2=Evan Smiley|title=Bankruptcy for Businesses: Benefits, Pitfalls and Alternatives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74KzPHVvcc8C|date=17 April 2007|publisher=Entrepreneur Press|isbn=978-1-59918-096-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debt restructuring ==
[[Debt restructuring]] is a process that allows a private or public company - or a sovereign entity - facing cash flow problems and [[financial distress]], to reduce and renegotiate its delinquent debts in order to improve or restore liquidity and rehabilitate so that it can continue its operations.

Out-of court restructurings, also known as workouts, are increasingly becoming a global reality. A debt restructuring is usually less expensive and a preferable alternative to bankruptcy. The main costs associated with a business debt restructuring are the time and effort to negotiate with bankers, creditors, vendors and tax authorities. Debt restructurings typically involve a reduction of debt and an extension of payment terms.

== Debt consolidation ==

Debt is a problem if the interest payments are greater than the debtor can afford. [[Debt consolidation]] typically involves borrowing from one lender (typically a bank), at a low rate of interest, sufficient funds to repay a number of higher interest rate debts (such as [[credit cards]]).  By consolidating debts, the debtor replaces many payments to many different creditors with one monthly payment to one creditor, thereby simplifying their monthly budget. In addition, the lower interest rate means that more of the debtor's monthly payment is applied against the principal of the loan, resulting in faster debt repayment.  It may be necessary to have a co-signor or other security, such as a car, if the borrower's credit is not sufficient on their own.

== Formal proposal to creditors ==

If the debtor cannot deal with their debt problems through personal budgeting, negotiation with creditors, or debt consolidation, the final bankruptcy alternative is a formal proposal or deal with the creditors.

Different countries have different legal procedures for compromising debts.  In the United States, a debtor can file a [[Chapter 13]] Wager Earner Plan.  The plan will typically last for up to five years, during which time the debtor makes payments that are distributed to their creditors.

In Canada, a Consumer Proposal can be filed with the assistance of a government-licensed proposal administrator.  Forty-five days after filing the proposal the creditors vote on the proposal, which is considered accepted if more than half of the creditors, by dollar value, vote to approve the proposal.

== Individual Voluntary Arrangement ==

In the UK the [[individual voluntary arrangement]] (IVA) represents the main formal alternative to a debtors bankruptcy petition. The IVA is part of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]] and essentially allows a debtor to reach a formal repayment arrangement with their creditors usually over a 5-year period. In most cases the debtor does not repay their debts in full to their creditors however the IVA proposal essentially allows for any remaining debt to be written off by the creditors at the end of the 5 year repayment period. As with bankruptcy petitions the number of IVA proposals has been increasing rapidly in the UK in recent years.

A '''bowl sink''', the first [[neologism|coined term]] for the more commonly known ''vessel sink'', is a free-standing [[sink]] that sits directly on the counter-top or [[furniture]] on which it is mounted. Originally invented by Meredith Wolf,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} a former [[Rhode Island]] resident, the [[Product (business)|product]] is now a worldwide decorative piece of [[art]] which serves as a sink and provides [[decor]].

This type of sink is produced by numerous firms, and is found in many [[hotel]]s, [[restaurant]]s, and [[home]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kohler.ca/planning/detail.jsp?aid=1138050337486.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Business rule mining''' is the process of extracting essential intellectual business logic in the form of [[Business rule|Business Rules]] from packaged or [[Legacy software]] applications, recasting them in natural or formal language, and storing them in a source rule repository for further analysis or [[Forward_engineering#MDA_approach|forward engineering]]. The goal is to capture these legacy business rules in a way that the business can validate, control and change them over time. 

== Overview ==
Business rule mining supports a [[Business rules approach]], which is defined as a formal way of managing and automating an organization's business rules so that the business behaves and evolves as its leaders intend. 

It is also commonly conducted as part of an [[Software modernization|application modernization]] project evolving legacy software applications to [[service oriented architecture]] (SOA) solutions, transitioning to packaged software, redeveloping new in-house applications, or to facilitate knowledge retention and communication between business and [[Information technologies|IT]] professionals in a [[Software maintenance|maintenance]] environment.

== Alternative Approaches ==
Alternative approaches to rule mining are manual and automated. 

A manual approach involves the hand-writing of rules on the basis of subject matter expert interviews and the inspection of [[source code]], [[Batch processing|job flows]], [[data structure]]s and observed behavior. 

Manually extracting rules is complicated by the difficulty of locating and understanding highly interdependent logic that has been interwoven into millions of lines of software code.  

An automated approach utilizes repository-based software to locate logical connections inherent within applications and extract them into a predetermined business rules format.

With automation, an effective approach is to apply semantic structures to existing applications.  By overlaying business contexts onto legacy applications, rules miners can focus effort on discovering rules from systems that are valuable to the business.  Effort is redirected away from mining commoditized or irrelevant applications.  

Further, best practices &lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Rule_Mining_Best_Practices best practices]&lt;/ref&gt; coupled with various tool-assisted techniques of capturing programs’ semantics speeds the transformation of technical rules to true business rules.  Adding business semantics to the analysis process allows users to abstract technical concepts and descriptors that are normal in an application to a business level that is consumable by a rules analyst. 

System integrators, software vendors, rules mining practitioners, and in-house development teams have developed technologies, proprietary methodologies and industry-specific templates for application modernization and business rule mining.

'''Capability management''' is a high-level integrative [[management]] function, with particular application in the context of [[Defense (military)|defence]].

== Overview ==
Capability management aims to balance economy in meeting current operational [[requirements]], with the sustainable use of current capabilities, and the development of future capabilities, to meet the sometimes competing strategic and current operational objectives of an [[Business|enterprise]]. Accordingly, effective capability management:

* Assists organizations to better understand, and effectively integrate the total enterprise ability or capacity to achieve strategic and current operational objectives; and
* Develops and provides solutions that focus on the management of the interlinking functions and activities in the enterprise's strategic and current operational contexts.

In military contexts, capabilities may also be analysed in terms of Force Structure and the Preparedness of elements or groupings within that Force Structure.  Preparedness in turn may be analysed in terms of Readiness and Sustainability.

In both the military and commercial contexts, net-centric operations and related concepts are playing an increasingly important role in leading and driving business transformation, and contemporary capability management needs to have close regard of those factors.  The level of interoperability, both technical and organisational/social, is a critical determinant of the net-centric capability that is able to be realised and employed.

== Capability management topics ==

=== Capability ===
Enterprises consist of a portfolio or matrix of capabilities that are used in various combinations to achieve outcomes. Within that portfolio, a capability will be transient unless managed and maintained over time.  Therefore, a typical capability lifecycle spans needs, requirements, acquisition, in-service and obsolescence/disposal phases.

While a highly developed management discipline within several national military organisations, the concepts, principles and practices of capability management are readily adaptable and effective for wide-ranging application in the strategy and operations of many other enterprises.

=== Defining capabilities in the US military ===
The JCIDS Manual, CJCSM 3170.01, states that definitions of identified capabilities must satisfy two rules:&lt;ref name="DoD07Db"&gt;DoD (2003). [https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=31667&amp;lang=en-US DoDAF 1.0 Deskbook] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927203147/https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=31667&amp;lang=en-US# |date=2007-09-27 }} 15 Aug 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Capability definitions must contain the required attributes with appropriate measures of effectiveness (e.g.: time, distance, effect [including scale] and obstacles to overcome).
* Capability definitions should be general and not influence a decision in favor of a particular means of implementation. The definition should be specific enough to evaluate alternative approaches to implement the capability.
[[Image:Capabilities Described with Architectures.jpg|thumb|320px|Capabilities Described with Architectures.&lt;ref name= "DoD07Db"/&gt;]]
Capabilities are organized around concepts of operations (CONOPS), because the CONOPS describe how a specified course of action is to be executed. The ability to execute the specified course of action depends on many factors and the relationship between those factors. Capabilities can be described as one or more sequences of activities, referred to as operational threads. The threads are composed of a set of activities that can be grouped to form the basis for a mission area architecture. The architecture then provides the structure for defining and understanding the many factors that impact the capability. The figure illustrates this sequence of relationships.&lt;ref name= "DoD07Db"/&gt;

The Navy has also endorsed using architectures to understand and analyze capabilities and their associated requirements. The Navy performs this architecture analysis based on the concept of MCPs. The intent is to consider all of the factors that contribute to the desired mission capability as an integrated system. An MCP is defined as “a task-oriented bundle of CONOPS, processes, and organization structures supported by networks, sensors, weapons, and systems, as well as personnel training and support services to sustain a core naval capability.” The MCP and associated analysis then provide the basis for acquisition decisions.&lt;ref name= "DoD07Db"/&gt;

=== Capability management considerations ===
Due to the complexities of system-of-systems integration, interoperability, and the dynamic nature of operations, capability management is greatly assisted by modelling and simulating realistic strategic scenarios and contexts, in order to inform business cases and decision-making.  Through those considerations and practices, the enterprise and its performance can be continuously assessed and projected into the future. Well executed capability management therefore clearly informs strategic and operational decisions, and aids in the development of diverse but well-considered strategic and operational options, so they are readily available off-the-shelf.  This should also endow significant agility to an enterprise, providing enhanced "contingency capital" and risk mitigation.

Capability management therefore centers on:
* Strategic and operational appreciations and analyses
* Capability conceptualization, definition and development
* [[Operations research]] and analysis
* Context or scenario-based capability modelling and simulation
* Capability costing
* Capital project business cases and management
* Decision making and decision support
* Capability assurance and performance management

== Capability management frameworks ==
The interlinking functions and activities of the enterprise may be defined under several best-practice paradigms or frameworks, such as the [[Balanced Scorecard]] (BSC), or the US [[Department of Defense Architecture Framework]] (DoDAF), The [[MODAF|Ministry of Defence Architecture Framework]](MODAF), The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) and Zachman's Framework for Enterprise Architecture. In other words, capability is typically managed and assessed with regard to several dimensions or integrative elements.

=== DOTMLPF ===
The US military analyses its capabilities in the dimensions of "DOTMLPF", being:
* [[Doctrine]]
* Organizations
* Training
* [[Materiel]]
* [[Leader development]]
* [[military personnel|Personnel]]
* Facilities

=== Defence Lines of Development ===
The UK MoD uses a similar breakdown of Defence Lines of Development (DLoDs) as follows:
* '''T'''raining
* '''E'''quipment
* '''P'''ersonnel
* '''I'''nformation
* Concepts and '''D'''octrine
* '''O'''rganisation
* '''I'''nfrastructure
* '''L'''ogistics
The [[mnemonic]] '''"Tepid oil"''' is used to remember these.  Additionally, though not a DLoD in itself, the unifying theme of 'interoperability' is also considered to ensure a holistic approach to capability integration.

The UK MoD cites Interoperability as an overarching theme that must be considered when any DLoD is being addressed.

=== Fundamental Inputs to Capability ===
The Australian Defence Organisation also analyses its capabilities in similar dimensions - the so-called Fundamental Inputs to Capability. These are:
* Command and Management
* Organisation
* Major Systems
* Personnel
* Supplies
* Support
* Facilities
* Collective Training
* Industry
These FIC must be integrated and managed within a defined or constraining financial envelope in order to realise and sustain a capability: a deficiency in any one adversely impacts the whole.

A '''cash advance''' is a service provided by most [[credit card]] and [[charge card]] issuers. The service allows cardholders to withdraw [[cash]], either through an [[automatic teller machine|ATM]] or over the counter at a bank or other financial agency, up to a certain limit. For a credit card, this will be the credit limit (or some percentage of it).

Cash advances often incur a fee of 3 to 5 percent of the amount being borrowed. When made on a credit card, the interest is often higher than other credit card transactions. The interest compounds daily starting from the day cash is borrowed.

Some "purchases" made with a credit card of items that are viewed as cash are also considered to be cash advances in accordance with the credit card network's guidelines, thereby incurring the higher interest rate and the lack of the grace period. These often include [[money order]]s, [[Debit_card#Prepaid_debit_cards|prepaid debit cards]], [[lottery]] tickets, [[gaming chip]]s, and certain taxes and fees paid to certain governments. However, should the merchant not disclose the actual nature of the transactions, these will be processed as regular credit card transactions. Many merchants have passed on the credit card processing fees to the credit card holders in spite of the credit card network's guidelines, which state the credit card holders should not have any extra fee for doing a transaction with a credit card.

Under card scheme rules, a credit card holder presenting an accepted form of identification must be issued a cash advance over the counter at any bank which issues that type of credit card, even if the cardholder cannot give their [[personal identification number|PIN]].

'''''Catan''''' was the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] version of [[Klaus Teuber|Klaus Teuber's]] ''[[The Settlers of Catan]]'', developed by [[Big Huge Games]] in collaboration with Teuber. It was released on May 2, 2007. It is the first [[German-style board game]] to be released on Xbox Live Arcade, which was followed by ''[[Carcassonne (video game)|Carcassonne]]''.

The game has since been removed from Xbox Live Arcade and is no longer available to purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kleist|first1=Jeff|title=Catan Delisted From XBLA, Multiplayer Nigh on Mobile|url=http://www.technologytell.com/gaming/129451/catan-delisted-xbla-multiplayer-nigh-mobile/|accessdate=9 March 2015|ref=Technology Tell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
During an interview with Big Huge Games founder [[Brian Reynolds (game designer)|Brian Reynolds]], it was revealed that [[Microsoft]] approached Big Huge Games with the idea for the project.&lt;ref name=joystiq&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/02/22/off-the-grid-interviews-brian-reynolds-of-big-huge-games/ | title=Off the Grid interviews Brian Reynolds of Big Huge Games | last=Siegel | first=Scott Jon | publisher=Joystiq.com | date=2007-02-22 | accessdate=2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the same interview, Klaus Teuber's collaboration on the project was explained, noting that he was instrumental in helping Reynolds create the AI, using notes and statistics he had generated years ago but had never previously been able to apply.

Reynolds later stated, regarding the board game, "The design is so elegant you can teach someone to play in minutes and then spend years trying to master it. With our expertise in interface design and artificial intelligence, it seemed like a natural fit for the project!".&lt;ref name=catanlive&gt;{{cite web | url=http://catanlive.com/ | title=Catan - Big Huge Games | publisher=Big Huge Games | accessdate=2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teuber has fully endorsed the Big Huge Games version, claiming that the game has exceeded his expectations and noting that he himself has lost several games in a row to the AI.&lt;ref name="catanlive" /&gt; The rules of the computerized version are faithful to the original, with one exception suggested by Teuber himself; the number of resource cards held by players is not limited to the number of resource cards which came with the board game. This was the original design intent, but one which couldn't be implemented due to the necessity to include only a finite number of physical cards in game boxes.&lt;ref name=igninterview&gt;{{cite web | url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/784/784819p1.html | title=IGN: Big Huge Games Talks Catan | last=Brudvig | first=Erik | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=2007-05-01 | accessdate=2007-05-04 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515053020/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/784/784819p1.html# | archive-date=2007-05-15 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
[[Image:Catan360.jpg|right|thumb|Typical gameplay screenshot.]]
As with the traditional [[board game]], ''Catan'' uses a game board composed of 19 randomly arranged hexagonal tiles, each representing a different type of terrain or resource.  Through strategy, luck, and skillful negotiation, 3 or 4 players vie to be the first to earn 10 victory points.  This is done through building and enlarging settlements, by establishing the largest army, by building the longest road, or through the use of certain ''development cards''.

''Catan'' claims to have the best ''Settlers of Catan'' [[artificial intelligence]] to date, featuring thirteen unique AI personalities for single player play and multiplayer games with fewer than four humans.&lt;ref name="catanlive" /&gt; Each AI personality, portrayed by a likeness of a famous leader or general (e.g. [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Cleopatra]], etc.), has attributes such as their preferred strategy for winning, how quickly they like to expand, and their favorite resource.&lt;ref name="joystiq" /&gt; Three difficulty levels (easy, medium, and hard) control the level of expertise displayed by these opponents.

The game features two different "skins" for the game board. The first is a traditional flat view of the board, while the second is a "living world", showing the board as a 3D environment. The board can be rotated during gameplay to provide the desired view, and users can also tweak other visual options such as player colors (for those who are [[Color blindness|color blind]]).

As is typical of Xbox Live Arcade games, the game features online play and leaderboards. Separate leaderboards are used to display single player and multiplayer rankings. Unlike many games which keep the [[Xbox Live#TrueSkill|TrueSkill]] level of the players hidden, ''Catan'' displays the calculated current values on one of the leaderboards.

Gameplay is turn-based, but turn timers are used to prevent individual players from halting the progression of the game. While not accessible in ranked matches, custom matches can make use of user-defined "House Rules". Items which can be tweaked include the turn timer, how resource production works, rules for the thief/robber, and several others.

In all types of matches, players can use graphical "ticklers" (or "emotes") to communicate thoughts or feelings, including love or hatred of the dice and/or other players. Similar devices, referred to as "Fooms", were previously available in the Hardwood series of Xbox Live Arcade games. These can be used as an alternative to voice chat (which is supported but not required) in order to, for example, encourage opponents to "sweeten a deal" or warn that they are too close to winning. The ticklers are used by AI players to indicate their "mood" in response to a player's actions; pleasing AIs will influence them to treat the player as an ally (though not to the point of jeopardizing their position), while angering them will serve to focus their negative attention. AI players will react to player-directed emotes towards them as well.

== Downloadable content ==
Less than a week after the title's release, a separate theme pack ("Themes Pack 1") and picture pack ("Generals Picture Pack 1") were made available for download.

On May 31, 2007 a "Mayfair" skin pack (to change the visual representation of the game to the United States version of the board game) was available, as well another gamertag picture pack ("Generals Picture Pack 2").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/05/30/catan-pictures-and-skin-pack.aspx | title=Catan: Pictures and Skin Pack | publisher=MajorNelson.com | accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2007, a "Generals" AI expansion pack was released which added additional computer-controlled opponents, including [[Joan of Arc]], [[Hannibal]], and [[Tokugawa Ieyasu|Tokugawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/06/13/catan-generals-expansion-pack-1.aspx | title=Catan - Generals Expansion Pack 1 | publisher=MajorNelson.com | accessdate=2007-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews of the game have generally found it to be a solid adaptation of the classic board game, but noting that this inherently limits the game's audience. While those who enjoy slower-paced strategy games will likely find the title a good value, the pace won't appeal to players who demand more action. The user interface has been well received, with the trading interface receiving wide praise, although reviews note several negatives as well, including the title's lack of support for the [[Xbox Live Vision]] camera and the absence of a local multiplayer option. Additionally, the game uses a relatively small text font which may be hard to read on smaller televisions, although the developers have stated that the game uses separate fonts for high-definition and standard-definition displays.

Contrary to published critical reviews, however, customer reaction has been strongly positive,&lt;ref name="Metacritic - Catan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/xbox360/settlersofcatan?q=catan | title=Metacritic - Catan | publisher=Metacritic | accessdate=2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/164026 | title=Thread: Catan for Xbox 360 out Wednesday | work=Boardgamegeek Forums | accessdate=2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the game debuting third in sales in its first week of availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.majornelson.com/archive/2007/05/05/xbox-live-activity-for-week-of-4-30.aspx | title=Xbox Live's Major Nelson: Xbox Live Activity for week of 4/30 | publisher=MajorNelson.com | accessdate=2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 11, 2011, the [[GameRankings]] score is 83%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages4/935185.asp GameRankings.com GameRankings - Catan]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Metacritic]] score is 81%.&lt;ref name="Metacritic - Catan"/&gt;

'''[[Child work]]''' covers the application of physical and mental contributions by children towards achieving a personal or communal goal.  As a form of [[prosocial behavior]], children's work is often a vital contribution towards community productivity and typically involves non-exploitative [[Motivation#Indigenous education and learning|motivations]] for children's engagement in work activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdillon|first=Michael|title=Rights and Wrongs of Children's Work|year=2010|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4889-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Activities can range from domestic [[household chores]] to participation in family and community endeavors.

==Child work and indigenous American communities==

Children's work is a valued means of [[Child development of the indigenous peoples of the Americas|learning and child-rearing]] in many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]] communities.  It is seen as eagerly contributing in a collaborative and flexible environment, aimed at the children learning consideration, responsibility, and skills with the guidance and support of adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning by Observing and Pitching In Overview|url=http://www.learningbyobservingandpitchingin.com/icp-overview-english|accessdate=21 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous American children are motivated to participate in the community because of [[Value (personal and cultural)|cultural values]], for example, everyone does something to participate, and wanting to be an equal member of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pewewardy | first1 = C | year = 2002 | title = Learning styles of American Indian/Alaska Native Students: A review of the literature and implications for practice | url = | journal = Journal of American Indian Education | volume = 41 | issue = | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The children do not see it as working, but as helping, because they feel responsible for what happens within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coppens | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Alcala | first2 = L. | last3 = Mejia-Arauz | first3 =  | last4 = Rogoff | first4 = B. | year = 2014 | title = Children's initiative in family household work in Mexico | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 116–130 | doi =  10.1159/000356768}}&lt;/ref&gt; As demonstrated by a [[Nahua peoples|Mexican Nahua]] community, children are encouraged to begin child work at the age of two for about 6 to 7 hours a day. They do not need to be convinced to help, but want to be involved in the activity. Child work can be household help, taking care of family members, or helping in community endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alcala | first1 = L. | last2 = Rogoff | first2 = B. | last3 = Mejia-Arauz | first3 = R. | last4 = Coppens | first4 = A.

[[Indigenous American]] children learn functional life skills through real-time [[Observational learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|observation]] of adults and [[Child Integration|interactive participation]] of these learned skills within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=R.|author2=Rogoff, B. |title=Side by side: Learning through observation and participation|journal=Ethos|year=2009|volume=37|pages=102–138|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1352.2009.01033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Active contributions to family and community work directly affects children's [[cognitive]] maturity by allowing children agency over their own development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdillon|first=Michael|title=Rights and Wrongs of Children's Work|year=2010|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-4889-0|pages=134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; This maturity at a younger age allows children to perform, potentially, higher-skilled tasks. For example, younger children have shown initiative by helping strangers to make them feel like a part of the community. Children do this by offering to help strangers or by treating them like family.&lt;ref&gt;Bolin, I. (2006). Growing up in a culture of respect child rearing in highland Peru. Austin: University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This maturity comes from the community fully incorporating children at a young age and allowing them to participate in everyday tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maynard | first1 = A | year = 2002 | title = Maynard, A. E.. (2002). Cultural teaching: The development of teaching skills in Maya sibling interactions | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 73 | issue = 3| pages = 969–982 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00450}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community trusts their children and treats them as equals, so the children want to engage in the community as much as they can. For example, parents trust their children to translate and negotiate bills with people, when the parents cannot speak the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reynolds | first1 = J. F. | last2 = Orellana | first2 = M. F. | year = 2009 | title = New immigrant youth interpreting in white public space | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 111 | issue = 2| pages = 211–223 | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01114.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
For example, the maturity that indigenous American children develop is demonstrated in Zinacantec [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] communities, where children learn complex motor skills and techniques for weaving through keen observation of working adults and by executing the skills themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=A. |author2=Greenfield, P. |author3=Childs, C.|title=Culture, history, biology, and body: Native and non-native acquisition of technical skill|journal=Ethos|year=1999|volume=27|issue=3|pages=379–402|doi=10.1525/eth.1999.27.3.379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in [[Peru]], young Chillihuani boys learn how to build shelters and homes by actively assisting adults during the building process by moving and placing appropriate size stones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bolin|first=Inge|title=Growing Up in a Culture of Respect: Child Rearing in Highland Peru|year=2006|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=978-0-292-71298-0|pages=63–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnographic studies show that Indigenous American children learn intently through keen observation in activities by other children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silva|first=Katie |author2=Correa-Chavez, M. |author3=Rogoff, B.|title=Mexican-Heritage children's attention and learning from interactions directed to others.|journal=Child Development|date=2010|volume=81|pages=898–912|url=http://www.learningbyobservingandpitchingin.com/intent-community-participation-facets/means-of-learning-1/silvacorrearogoff2010|accessdate=2014-05-22|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2010.01441.x|pmid=20573112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children's work is also attributed to learning [[Moral development#Morality and culture|cultural values]] in addition to individual personality development.  Many Indigenous children in [[Peru]] develop a sense of responsibility by participating in work often motivated by an internal and external drive to be an active participant in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ames|first=P.|title=Learning to be responsible: Young children transitions outside school|journal=Learning, Culture, and Social Interaction|year=2013|volume=2|pages=143–154|doi=10.1016/j.lcsi.2013.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paradise &amp; De Haan refer to this process as practicing responsibility and reciprocity through role-taking as an observing helper or active performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=R.|author2=De Haan, M.|title=Responsibility and reciprocity: Social organization of Mazahua learning practices|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|year=2009|volume=40|issue=2|pages=187–204|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1492.2009.01035.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through participation in work, most children in Indigenous American communities identify as cooperative members of a community through first-hand exposure to the direct impact of their action or inaction in community responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ames|first=P.|title=Learning to be responsible: Young children transitions outside school|journal=Learning, Culture, and Social Interaction|year=2013|volume=2|pages=143–154|doi=10.1016/j.lcsi.2013.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[San Pedro La Laguna|Guatemalan Mayan communities]], children are often expected to take part in these practices. When schools became prevalent, children who were not seen as providing valuable contributions to family and community endeavors may only then be sent away to school to make use of their time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|title=Developing Destinies: A Mayan Midwife and Town|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-19-531990-3|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some indigenous communities are skeptical of sending their children to [[Western Schools|western schools]], because their children lose the initiative to help their families and are not as motivated. Western schooling is a different way of teaching than indigenous communities teach their children.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn,S. (2007). Transborder Lives: Indigenous Oaxacans in Mexico, California, and Oregon. Duke University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0822339908}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, children that go through western schooling learn English and end up translating for their families, which is another way of helping them or another way of learning. The children perfect their English and Spanish, as well as their social skills because they interact with many types of people by translating for their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reynolds | first1 = J. F. | last2 = Orellana | first2 = M. F. | year = 2009 | title = New immigrant youth interpreting in white public space | url = | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 111 | issue = 2| pages = 211–223 | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1433.2009.01114.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning by Observing and Pitching In===

The initiative that indigenous children demonstrate is part of the process of [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]]. LOPI is a seven faceted process of learning commonly used by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous American]] cultures. It fully immerses a child into the community and allows them to learn, through observation and participation, as they help within their family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = B | year = 2014 | title = Learning by observing and pitching in to family and community endeavors: An orientation | url = | journal = Human Development | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 69–81 | doi = 10.1159/000356757 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children learn through their work, which is a cultural tradition among indigenous people. Child work is a social experience that allows a child to gain a sense of responsibility and build ties among the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paradise | first1 = R. | last2 = Rogoff | first2 = B. | year = 2009 | title = Side by side: Learning by observing and pitching in. | url = | journal = Ethos Journal of the Society for Psychological Anthropology | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 102–138 | doi = 10.1111/j.1548-1352.2009.01033.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International Labour Organization recognition of child work vs. child labour==

The [[International Labour Organization]] recognizes the importance of child work in various cultures.  In most Indigenous communities, work is a source of pride for both adults and children.  Because of different cultural views involving labor, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) developed a series of culturally sensitive mandates including Conventions No. 169, 107, 138, and 182 to protect indigenous culture, traditions, and identities.  Conventions No. 138 and 182 lead in the fight against child labour, while No. 107 and 169 promote the right of indigenous and tribal peoples and protect their right to define their own developmental priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Larsen|first=P.B.|title=Indigenous and tribal children: assessing child labour and education challenges.|publisher=International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), International Labour Office.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The [[ILO]] recognizes these changes are necessary to respect the culture and traditions of other communities while also looking after the welfare of children. In many Indigenous communities, [[parenting]] includes teaching children learn important life lessons through the act of work and through participation in daily life.

Working is seen as a learning process preparing children for the tasks they will have to do as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Guidelines for Combating Child Labour Among Indigenous Peoples|year=2006|publisher=International Labour Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=92-2-118748-9|url=http://www.ilo.org/publns}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a belief that the family's and child’s well-being and survival is a shared responsibility between members of the whole family.  They also see work as an intrinsic part of their child's developmental process.  While these attitudes toward child work remain, many children and parents from indigenous communities still highly value education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Larsen|first=P.B.|title=Indigenous and tribal children: assessing child labour and education challenges.|publisher=International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC), International Labour Office.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ILO wants to include these communities in the fight against exploitative child labor while being sensitive to their traditions and values.

'''''Citizen Kane''''' is a 1941 American [[mystery film|mystery]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] by [[Orson Welles]], its producer, co-screenwriter, director and star. The picture was Welles's [[List of directorial debuts|first feature film]]. Nominated for [[14th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]] in nine categories, it won an [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Academy Award for Best Writing (Original Screenplay)]] by [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and Welles. Considered by many critics, filmmakers, and fans to be the [[List of films considered the best|greatest film ever made]], ''Citizen Kane'' was voted as such in five consecutive [[British Film Institute]] ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' polls of critics, and it topped the [[American Film Institute]]'s  [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years&amp;nbsp;... 100 Movies]] list in 1998, as well as its [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|2007 update]]. ''Citizen Kane'' is particularly praised for its cinematography, music, editing and narrative structure, which have been considered innovative and precedent-setting.

The [[film à clef|quasi-biographical film]] examines the life and legacy of [[Charles Foster Kane]], played by Welles, a character based in part upon the American newspaper magnates [[William Randolph Hearst]] and [[Joseph Pulitzer]], Chicago tycoons [[Samuel Insull]] and [[Harold Fowler McCormick|Harold McCormick]], and aspects of the screenwriters' own lives. Upon its release, Hearst prohibited mention of the film in any of his newspapers. Kane's career in the publishing world is born of idealistic social service, but gradually evolves into a ruthless pursuit of power. Narrated principally through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashbacks]], the story is told through the research of a [[newsreel]] reporter seeking to solve the mystery of the newspaper magnate's dying word: "Rosebud".

After the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] successes of Welles's [[Mercury Theatre]] and the controversial 1938 radio broadcast "[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]" on ''[[The Mercury Theatre on the Air]]'', Welles was courted by Hollywood. He signed a contract with [[RKO Pictures]] in 1939. Unusually for an untried director, he was given the freedom to develop his own story, to use his own cast and crew, and to have [[final cut privilege]]. Following two abortive attempts to get a project off the ground, he wrote the [[Screenplay for Citizen Kane|screenplay for ''Citizen Kane'']], collaborating on the effort with Herman Mankiewicz. Principal photography took place in 1940 and the film received its American release in 1941.

While a critical success, ''Citizen Kane'' failed to recoup its costs at the box office. The film faded from view after its release, but was subsequently returned to the public's attention when it was praised by such French critics as [[André Bazin]] and given an American revival in 1956. The film was released on [[Blu-ray]] on September 13, 2011, for a special 70th anniversary edition.

In a mansion in [[Xanadu (Citizen Kane)|Xanadu]], a vast palatial estate in [[Florida]], the elderly [[Charles Foster Kane]] is on his deathbed. Holding a [[snow globe]], he utters a word, "Rosebud", and dies; the globe slips from his hand and smashes on the floor. A [[newsreel]] obituary tells the life story of Kane, an enormously wealthy newspaper publisher. Kane's death becomes sensational news around the world, and the newsreel's producer tasks reporter Jerry Thompson with discovering the meaning of "Rosebud".

Thompson sets out to interview Kane's friends and associates. He tries to approach Susan Alexander Kane, now an [[alcoholic]] who runs her own nightclub, but she refuses to talk to him. Thompson goes to the private archive of the late banker Walter Parks Thatcher. Through Thatcher's written memoirs, Thompson learns that Kane's childhood began in poverty in Colorado.

In 1871, after a gold mine is discovered on her property, Kane's mother Mary Kane sends Charles away to live with Thatcher so that he would be properly educated. It is also implied that Kane's father could be violent towards his son and that is another reason she wants to send him away. While Thatcher and Charles' parents discuss arrangements inside, the young Kane plays happily with a sled in the snow outside his parents' boarding-house and protests being sent to live with Thatcher. Furious at the prospect of exile from his own family to live with a man he does not know, the boy strikes Thatcher with his sled and attempts to run away.

Years later, after gaining full control over his trust fund at the age of 25, Kane enters the newspaper business and embarks on a career of [[yellow journalism]]. He takes control of the ''New York Inquirer'' and starts publishing scandalous articles that attack Thatcher's business interests. After the stock market crash in 1929, Kane is forced to sell controlling interest of his newspaper empire to Thatcher.

Back in the present, Thompson interviews Kane's personal business manager, Mr. Bernstein. Bernstein recalls how Kane hired the best journalists available to build the ''Inquirer''{{'}}s circulation. Kane rose to power by successfully manipulating public opinion regarding the [[Spanish–American War]] and marrying Emily Norton, the niece of a President of the United States.

Thompson interviews Kane's estranged best friend, Jedediah Leland, in a [[retirement home]]. Leland recalls how Kane's marriage to Emily disintegrates more and more over the years, and he begins an affair with amateur singer Susan Alexander while he is running for [[Governor of New York]]. Both his wife and his political opponent discover the affair and the [[Political scandal|public scandal]] ends his political career. Kane marries Susan and forces her into a humiliating [[opera]]tic career for which she has neither the talent nor the ambition.

Back in the present, Susan now consents to an interview with Thompson and recalls her failed opera career. Kane finally allows her to abandon her singing career after she attempts suicide. After years spent dominated by Kane and living in isolation at Xanadu, Susan leaves Kane. Kane's butler Raymond recounts that, after Susan leaves him, Kane begins violently destroying the contents of her bedroom. He suddenly calms down when he sees a snow globe and says, "Rosebud".

Back at Xanadu, Kane's belongings are being cataloged or discarded. Thompson concludes that he is unable to solve the mystery and that the meaning of Kane's last word will forever remain an enigma. As the film ends, the camera reveals that "Rosebud" is the trade name of the [[sled]] on which the eight-year-old Kane was playing on the day that he was taken from his home in Colorado. Thought to be junk by Xanadu's staff, the sled is burned in a furnace.

Welles signed his contract with RKO on August 21. This legendary contract stipulated that Welles would act in, direct, produce and write two films. Mercury would get $100,000 for the first film by January 1, 1940, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000, and $125,000 for a second film by January 1, 1941, plus 20% of profits after RKO recouped $500,000. The most controversial aspect of the contract was granting Welles complete artistic control of the two films so long as RKO approved both project's stories&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|169|December 2014}} and so long as the budget did not exceed $500,000.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|1–2, 153}} RKO executives would not be allowed to see any footage until Welles chose to show it to them, and no cuts could be made to either film without Welles's approval.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|169|December 2014}} Welles was allowed to develop the story without interference, select his own cast and crew, and have the [[final cut privilege|right of final cut]]. Granting final cut privilege was unprecedented for a studio since it placed artistic considerations over financial investment. The contract was deeply resented in the film industry, and the Hollywood press took every opportunity to mock RKO and Welles.

[[File:Orson-Home-1939.jpg|thumb|left|Orson Welles at his Hollywood home in 1939, during the long months it took to launch his first film project]]
Welles spent the first five months of his RKO contract trying to get his first project going, without success. "They are laying bets over on the RKO lot that the Orson Welles deal will end up without Orson ever doing a picture there," wrote ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|15}} It was agreed that Welles would film ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'', previously adapted for ''The Mercury Theatre on the Air'', which would be presented entirely through a [[Point of view shot|first-person camera]]. After elaborate pre-production and a day of test shooting with a hand-held camera—unheard of at the time—the project never reached production because Welles was unable to trim $50,000 from its budget.{{efn|"I did a very elaborate production for [''Heart of Darkness''], such as I've never done again—never could," Welles said. "I shot my bolt on preproduction on that picture.

He's in the pilot house and he can see himself reflected in the glass through which you see the jungle.

He then started work on the idea that became ''Citizen Kane''. Knowing the script would take time to prepare, Welles suggested to RKO that while that was being done—"so the year wouldn't be lost"—he make a humorous political thriller. Welles proposed ''The Smiler with a Knife'', from a novel by [[Cecil Day-Lewis]].&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|33–34}} When that project stalled in December 1939, Welles began brainstorming other story ideas with screenwriter [[Herman J.

One of the long-standing controversies about ''Citizen Kane'' has been the authorship of the screenplay.&lt;ref name=Meryman&gt;{{cite book |last=Meryman |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Meryman |title=Mank: The Wit, World and Life of Herman Mankiewicz |publisher=[[William Morrow and Company]], Inc. |location=New York |date=1978 |isbn=978-0-688-03356-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|237}} Welles conceived the project with screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who was writing radio plays for Welles's CBS Radio series, ''[[The Campbell Playhouse (radio series)|The Campbell Playhouse]]''.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|16}} Mankiewicz based the original outline on the life of [[William Randolph Hearst]], whom he knew socially and came to hate after being exiled from Hearst's circle.&lt;ref name=Meryman/&gt;{{Rp|231}}

In February 1940 Welles supplied Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes and put him under contract to write the first draft screenplay under the supervision of [[John Houseman]], Welles's former partner in the [[Mercury Theatre]]. Welles later explained, "I left him on his own finally, because we'd started to waste too much time haggling. So, after mutual agreements on storyline and character, Mank went off with Houseman and did his version, while I stayed in Hollywood and wrote mine."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Welles |first1=Orson |authorlink1=Orson Welles |last2=Bogdanovich |first2=Peter |authorlink2=Peter Bogdanovich |last3=Rosenbaum |first3=Jonathan |authorlink3=Jonathan Rosenbaum |title=[[This is Orson Welles]] |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] Publishers |location=New York |date=1992 |isbn=0-06-016616-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|54}} Taking these drafts, Welles drastically condensed and rearranged them, then added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, "At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all—who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW" /&gt;{{Rp|54}}

The terms of the contract stated that Mankiewicz was to receive no credit for his work, as he was hired as a [[script doctor]].&lt;ref name="Callow"&gt;{{cite book |last=Callow |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Callow |title=Orson Welles: The Road to Xanadu |publisher=[[Viking]] |location=New York |date=1996 |isbn=978-0-670-86722-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|487}} Before he signed the contract Mankiewicz was particularly advised by his agents that all credit for his work belonged to Welles and the Mercury Theatre, the "author and creator".&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|236–237}} As the film neared release, however, Mankiewicz began threatening Welles to get credit for the film—including threats to place full-page ads in trade papers and to get his friend [[Ben Hecht]] to write an exposé for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''. Mankiewicz also threatened to go to the [[Screen Writers Guild]] and claim full credit for writing the entire script by himself.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|204}}

After lodging a protest with the Screen Writers Guild, Mankiewicz withdrew it, then vacillated. The question was resolved in January 1941 when the studio, [[RKO Pictures]], awarded Mankiewicz credit. The guild credit form listed Welles first, Mankiewicz second. Welles's assistant [[Richard Wilson (director)|Richard Wilson]] said that the person who circled Mankiewicz's name in pencil, then drew an arrow that put it in first place, was Welles. The official credit reads, "Screenplay by Herman J. Mankiewicz and Orson Welles".&lt;ref name=Meryman/&gt;{{Rp|264–265}} Mankiewicz's rancor toward Welles grew over the remaining 12 years of his life.&lt;ref name="Whaley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whaley |first=Barton |date=2005 |title=Orson Welles: The Man Who Was Magic |url=https://www.lybrary.com/orson-welles-the-man-who-was-magic-p-400.html |publisher=Lybrary.com |asin=B005HEHQ7E }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|498}}

Questions over the authorship of the ''Citizen Kane'' screenplay were revived in 1971 by influential film critic [[Pauline Kael]], whose controversial 50,000-word essay "[[Raising Kane]]" was commissioned as an introduction to the shooting script in ''The Citizen Kane Book'',&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|494}} published in October 1971.&lt;ref name="CK Book Coming"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Citizen Kane Film Book Due in Fall |newspaper=[[The Bakersfield Californian]] |date=June 6, 1971 |quote=On Oct. 28, Atlantic–Little, Brown will publish ''The Citizen Kane Book'', an outsize volume that will include not only 'Raising Kane' but also, as Miss Kael had always intended, the complete, original text of the Mankiewicz–Welles shooting script, published here for the first time. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book-length essay first appeared in February 1971, in two consecutive issues of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|494}}&lt;ref name="Raising Kane"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kael |first1=Pauline |author-link1=Pauline Kael |last2=Welles |first2=Orson  |author-link2=Orson Welles |last3=Mankiewicz |first3=Herman J. |author-link3=Herman J.

[[File:Citizen-Kane-Mercury.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Mercury Theatre]] was an independent [[repertory theatre]] company founded by Orson Welles and John Houseman in 1937. The company produced theatrical presentations, radio programs, films, [[promptbook]]s and phonographic recordings.]]
''Citizen Kane'' was a rare film in that its principal roles were played by actors new to motion pictures.

"He trained us for films at the same time that he was training himself," recalled Agnes Moorehead. "Orson believed in good acting, and he realized that rehearsals were needed to get the most from his actors.

When ''The March of Time'' narrator [[Westbrook Van Voorhis]] asked for $25,000 to narrate the ''News on the March'' sequence, Alland demonstrated his ability to imitate Van Voorhis and Welles cast him.&lt;ref name="BBC Complete"/&gt;

Welles later said that casting character actor [[Gino Corrado]] in the small part of the waiter at the El Rancho broke his heart. Corrado had appeared in many Hollywood films, often as a waiter, and Welles wanted all of the actors to be new to films.&lt;ref name="Lunches"/&gt;{{Rp|171}}

Production advisor Miriam Geiger quickly compiled a handmade film textbook for Welles, a practical reference book of film techniques that he studied carefully.

"I'd learned whatever I knew in the projection room—from Ford. After dinner every night for about a month, I'd run ''Stagecoach'', often with some different technician or department head from the studio, and ask questions. 'How was this done?' 'Why was this done?' It was like going to school."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|29}}

Welles's cinematographer for the film was [[Gregg Toland]], described by Welles as "just then, the number-one cameraman in the world." To Welles's astonishment, Toland visited him at his office and said, "I want you to use me on your picture." He had seen some of the Mercury stage productions (including ''[[Caesar (Mercury Theatre)|Caesar]]''&lt;ref name="Whaley"/&gt;{{Rp|66}}) and said he wanted to work with someone who had never made a movie.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|59}} RKO hired Toland on loan from [[Samuel Goldwyn Productions]]&lt;ref name="Mulvey"/&gt;{{Rp|10}} in the first week of June 1940.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|40}}

"And he never tried to impress us that he was doing any miracles," Welles recalled. "I was calling for things only a beginner would have been ignorant enough to think anybody could ever do, and there he was, ''doing'' them."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|60}} Toland later explained that he wanted to work with Welles because he anticipated the first-time director's inexperience and reputation for audacious experimentation in the theater would allow the cinematographer to try new and innovative camera techniques that typical Hollywood films would never have allowed him to do.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|186|December 2014}} Unaware of filmmaking protocol, Welles adjusted the lights on set as he was accustomed to doing in the theater; Toland quietly re-balanced them, and was angry when one of the crew informed Welles that he was infringing on Toland's responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW 1A"/&gt;{{Rp|5:33–6:06}} During the first few weeks of June, Welles had lengthy discussions about the film with Toland and art director Perry Ferguson in the morning, and in the afternoon and evening he worked with actors and revised the script.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|69}}

"But we were shooting the ''picture''," Welles said, "because we wanted to get started and be already into it before anybody knew about it."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|57}}

At the time RKO executives were pressuring him to agree to direct a film called ''The Men from Mars'', to capitalize on "The War of the Worlds" radio broadcast. Welles said that he would consider making the project but wanted to make a different film first. At this time he did not inform them that he had already begun filming ''Citizen Kane.''&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|186}}

The early footage was called "Orson Welles Tests" on all paperwork.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|69}} The first "test" shot was the ''News on the March'' projection room scene, economically filmed in a real studio projection room in darkness that masked many actors who appeared in other roles later in the film.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|69}}&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|77–78}}{{efn|"I used the whole Mercury cast, heavily disguised by darkness," Welles said.

The next scenes were the El Rancho nightclub scenes and the scene in which Susan attempts suicide.{{efn|No figures can be found for the cost of filming Susan's attempted suicide, but filming the nightclub scene was budgeted at $1,038 and cost $1,376.79.&lt;ref name=Lebo&gt;{{cite book |last=Lebo |first=Harlan |title=Citizen Kane: The Fiftieth Anniversary Album |publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |location=New York |date=1990 |isbn=978-0-385-41473-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|74}}}}&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|69}} Welles later said that the nightclub set was available after another film had wrapped and that filming took 10 to 12 days to complete.

In the end of July, RKO approved the film and Welles was allowed to officially begin shooting, despite having already been filming "tests" for several weeks. Welles leaked stories to newspaper reporters that the tests had been so good that there was no need to re-shoot them. The first official scene to be shot was the breakfast montage sequence between Kane and his first wife Emily. To strategically save money and appease the RKO executives who opposed him, Welles rehearsed scenes extensively before actually shooting and filmed very few takes of each shot set-up.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|193|December 2014}} Welles never shot [[master shot]]s for any scene after Toland told him that Ford never shot them.&lt;ref name="Lunches"/&gt;{{Rp|169}} To appease the increasingly curious press, Welles threw a cocktail party for selected reporters, promising that they could watch a scene being filmed. When the journalists arrived Welles told them they had "just finished" shooting for the day but still had the party.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|193|December 2014}} Welles told the press that he was ahead of schedule (without factoring in the month of "test shooting"), thus discrediting claims that after a year in Hollywood without making a film he was a failure in the film industry.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|194|December 2014}}

[[File:Citizen-Kane-Welles-Collins.jpg|thumb|right|Welles fell ten feet while shooting the scene in which Kane shouts at the departing Boss Jim W. Gettys; his injuries required him to direct from a wheelchair for two weeks.]]
Welles usually worked 16 to 18 hours a day on the film. He often began work at 4 a.m. since the special effects make-up used to age him for certain scenes took up to four hours to apply. Welles used this time to discuss the day's shooting with Toland and other crew members. The special contact lenses used to make Welles look elderly proved very painful, and a doctor was employed to place them into Welles's eyes. Welles had difficulty seeing clearly while wearing them, which caused him to badly cut his wrist when shooting the scene in which Kane breaks up the furniture in Susan's bedroom. While shooting the scene in which Kane shouts at Gettys on the stairs of Susan Alexander's apartment building, Welles fell ten feet; an X-ray revealed two bone chips in his ankle.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|194|December 2014}} The injury required him to direct the film from a wheelchair for two weeks.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|194–195|December 2014}} He eventually wore a steel brace to resume performing on camera; it is visible in the low-angle scene between Kane and Leland after Kane loses the election.{{efn|"It took nerve to shoot from down there, with that steel brace right in front of the camera, but I thought rightly that at that point they'd be looking at Leland and not at me."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|61–62}}}}&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|61}} For the final scene, a stage at the Selznick studio was equipped with a working furnace, and multiple takes were required to show the sled being put into the fire and the word "Rosebud" consumed. Paul Stewart recalled that on the ninth take the Culver City Fire Department arrived in full gear because the furnace had grown so hot the flue caught fire. "Orson was delighted with the commotion", he said.&lt;ref name="Directors in Action"/&gt;{{Rp|8–9}}

When "Rosebud" was burned, Welles choreographed the scene while he had composer [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s cue playing on the set.&lt;ref name="alexross"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Alex |date=June 27, 2005 |title=Sound and Vision: Glass's 'Koyaanisqatsi' and the art of film scoring |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/06/27/050627crmu_music |journal=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Schaefer, many members of RKO's board of governors did not like Welles or the control that his contract gave him.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|186|December 2014}} However such board members as [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and NBC chief [[David Sarnoff]]&lt;ref name="Wakeman"/&gt;{{Rp|1170}} were sympathetic to Welles.&lt;ref name="Wellesnet Memos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=1585 |title=The Memos Part X: George Schaefer resigns as RKO president&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=Wellesnet.com |date=July 5, 2012 |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout production Welles had problems with these executives not respecting his contract's stipulation of non-interference and several spies arrived on set to report what they saw to the executives. When the executives would sometimes arrive on set unannounced the entire cast and crew would suddenly start playing softball until they left. Before official shooting began the executives intercepted all copies of the script and delayed their delivery to Welles. They had one copy sent to their office in New York, resulting in it being leaked to press.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|195|December 2014}}

[[Principal photography|Principal shooting]] wrapped October 24. Welles then took several weeks off of the film for a lecture tour, during which he also scouted additional locations with Toland and Ferguson. Filming resumed November 15&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|87}} with some re-shoots. Toland had to leave due to a commitment to shoot Howard Hughes' ''[[The Outlaw]]'', but Toland's camera crew continued working on the film and Toland was replaced by RKO cinematographer [[Harry J. Wild]]. The final day of shooting on November 30 was Kane's death scene.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|85}} Welles boasted that he only went 21 days over his official shooting schedule, without factoring in the month of "camera tests."&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|195|December 2014}} According to RKO records, the film cost $839,727.

===Post-production===
''Citizen Kane'' was edited by [[Robert Wise]] and assistant editor [[Mark Robson]].&lt;ref name="Mulvey"/&gt;{{Rp|85}} Both would become successful film directors. Wise was hired after Welles finished shooting the "camera tests" and began officially making the film. Wise said that Welles "had an older editor assigned to him for those tests and evidently he was not too happy and asked to have somebody else. I was roughly Orson's age and had several good credits." Wise and Robson began editing the film while it was still shooting and said that they "could tell certainly that we were getting something very special. It was outstanding film day in and day out."&lt;ref name="Wakeman"/&gt;{{Rp|1210}} Welles gave Wise detailed instructions and was usually not present during the film's editing.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|109}} The film was very well planned out and intentionally shot for such post-production techniques as slow [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolves]].&lt;ref name="BBC Complete"/&gt; The lack of coverage made editing easy since Welles and Toland edited the film "in camera" by leaving few options of how it could be put together.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|110}} Wise said the breakfast table sequence took weeks to edit and get the correct "timing" and "rhythm" for the [[whip pan]]s and overlapping dialogue.&lt;ref name="BBC Complete"/&gt; The ''News on the March'' sequence was edited by RKO's newsreel division to give it authenticity.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|110}} They used [[stock footage]] from [[Pathé News]] and the General Film Library.&lt;ref name="AFIcat"/&gt;

During post-production Welles and special effects artist [[Linwood G.

Stewart to re-do their work several times until he was satisfied.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|109}}

Welles hired Bernard Herrmann to compose the film's score. Where most Hollywood film scores were written quickly, in as few as two or three weeks after filming was completed, Herrmann was given 12 weeks to write the music. He had sufficient time to do his own orchestrations and conducting, and worked on the film reel by reel as it was shot and cut. He wrote complete musical pieces for some of the montages, and Welles edited many of the scenes to match their length.&lt;ref name="NYT Herrmann"&gt;{{cite news |last=Herrmann |first=Bernard |authorlink=Bernard Herrmann |title=Score for a Film |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=May 25, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Citizen Kane trailer}}

Written and directed by Welles at Toland's suggestion, the [[theatrical trailer]] for ''Citizen Kane'' differs from other trailers in that it did not feature a single second of footage of the actual film itself, but acts as a wholly original, [[tongue-in-cheek]], [[mockumentary|pseudo-documentary]] piece on the film's production.&lt;ref name="Lunches"/&gt;{{Rp|230}} Filmed at the same time as ''Citizen Kane'' itself, it offers the only existing behind-the-scenes footage of the film. The trailer, shot by Wild instead of Toland, follows an unseen Welles as he provides narration for a tour around the film set, introductions to the film's core cast members, and a brief overview of Kane's character.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|360}} The trailer also contains a number of trick shots, including one of [[Everett Sloane]] appearing at first to be running into the camera, which turns out to be the reflection of the camera in a mirror.&lt;ref name="Aus DVD trailer"&gt;{{cite AV media|title= Citizen Kane (Theatrical Trailer)|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Home Entertainment]]|date=2 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, it was almost unprecedented for a film trailer to not actually feature anything of the film itself; and while ''Citizen Kane'' is frequently cited as a groundbreaking, influential film, [[Simon Callow]] argues its trailer was no less original in its approach. Callow writes that it has "great playful charm&amp;nbsp;... it is a miniature [[documentary]], almost an introduction to the cinema&amp;nbsp;... Teasing, charming, completely original, it is a sort of conjuring trick: Without his face appearing once on the screen, Welles entirely dominates its five [sic] minutes' duration."&lt;ref name="Callow"/&gt;{{Rp|558–9}}

==Style==
Film scholars and historians view ''Citizen Kane'' as Welles's attempt to create a new style of filmmaking by studying various forms of it and combining them into one. However, Welles stated that his love for cinema began only when he started working on the film. When asked where he got the confidence as a first-time director to direct a film so radically different from contemporary cinema, he responded, "Ignorance, ignorance, sheer ignorance—you know there's no confidence to equal it. It's only when you know something about a profession, I think, that you're timid or careful."&lt;ref name="Estrin"/&gt;{{Rp|80}}

[[David Bordwell]] wrote that "The best way to understand ''Citizen Kane'' is to stop worshiping it as a triumph of technique." Bordwell argues that the film did not invent any of its famous techniques such as deep focus cinematography, shots of the ceilings, chiaroscuro lighting and temporal jump-cuts, and that many of these stylistics had been used in German Expressionist films of the 1920s, such as ''The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari''. But Bordwell asserts that the film did put them all together for the first time and perfected the medium in one single film.&lt;ref name="Wakeman"/&gt;{{Rp|1171}} In a 1948 interview, [[D. W. Griffith]] said, "I loved ''Citizen Kane'' and particularly loved the ideas he took from me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goodman |first=Ezra |title=Flash-Back to Griffith |publisher=''PM'' |date=May 19, 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments against the film's cinematic innovations were made as early as 1946 when French historian [[Georges Sadoul]] wrote, "The film is an encyclopedia of old techniques." He pointed out such examples as compositions that used both the foreground and the background in the films of [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]], special effects used in the films of [[Georges Méliès]], shots of the ceiling in [[Erich von Stroheim]]'s ''[[Greed (film)|Greed]]'' and newsreel montages in the films of [[Dziga Vertov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sadoul |first=Georges |authorlink=Georges Sadoul |title=Le Cinéma: Hypertrophie ducerveau ̄ Review of ''Citizen Kane'' |publisher=[[Les Lettres Françaises]], number 115 |location=Paris, France |date=July 5, 1946 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French film critic André Bazin defended the film, writing: "In this respect, the accusation of plagiarism could very well be extended to the film's use of panchromatic film or its exploitation of the properties of gelatinous silver halide." Bazin disagreed with Sadoul's comparison to Lumière's cinematography since ''Citizen Kane'' used more sophisticated lenses,&lt;ref name=BazinatWork&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bazin |first1=André |last2=Cardullo |first2=Bert (editor) |authorlink1=André Bazin |title=Bazin at Work: Major Essays &amp; Reviews From the Forties &amp; Fifties |publisher=Rutledge |location=New York &amp; London |date=1997 |isbn= 978-0-415-90018-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|232}} but acknowledged that it had similarities to such previous works as ''[[49th Parallel (film)|The 49th Parallel]]'' and ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]''. Bazin stated that "even if Welles did not invent the cinematic devices employed in ''Citizen Kane'', one should nevertheless credit him with the invention of their ''meaning''."&lt;ref name=BazinatWork/&gt;{{Rp|233}} Bazin championed the techniques in the film for its depiction of heightened reality, but Bordwell believed that the film's use of special effects contradicted some of Bazin's theories.&lt;ref name="Minding"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bordwell |first1=David |last2=Thompson |first2=Kristin |title=Minding Movies.

===Storytelling techniques===
''Citizen Kane'' eschews the traditional linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using different points of view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the [[unreliable narrator]] in literature.&lt;ref name="watched"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fabe |first=Marilyn |title=Closely Watched Films: an introduction to the art of narrative film technique |publisher=University of California Press |location=Oakland, CA |date=2004 |isbn=978-0-520-23891-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|83}} Welles also dispenses with the idea of a single storyteller and uses [[multiperspectivity|multiple narrators]] to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films.&lt;ref name="watched"/&gt;{{Rp|81}} Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping.&lt;ref name="politics"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gianos |first=Phillip |title=Politics and politicians in American film |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location=Santa Barbara, California |date=1999 |isbn=978-0-275-96766-6 |pages=170–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.&lt;ref name="watched"/&gt;{{Rp|82–84}}

The technique of using flashbacks had been used in earlier films—most notably in ''[[The Power and the Glory (1933 film)|The Power and the Glory]]'' (1933)&lt;ref name="Robbin Coons"&gt;{{cite news |last=Coons |first=Robbin |date=May 1, 1941 |title=Hollywood Sights and Sounds |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&amp;dat=19410501&amp;id=yOIcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=g2QEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3353,2902994 |newspaper=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]] |location=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but no film was as immersed in this technique as ''Citizen Kane''. The use of the reporter Thompson acts as a surrogate for the audience, questioning Kane's associates and piecing together his life.&lt;ref name="politics"/&gt;

At that time films typically had an "omniscient perspective", which Marilyn Fabe says give the audience the "illusion that we are looking with impunity into a world which is unaware of our gaze, Hollywood movies give us a feeling of power." The film begins in this fashion up until the ''News on the March'' sequence, after which we the audience see the film through the perspectives of others.&lt;ref name="watched"/&gt;{{Rp|81}} The ''News on the March'' sequence gives an overview of Kane's entire life (and the film's entire story) at the beginning of the film, leaving the audience without the typical suspense of wondering how it will end. Instead the film's repetitions of events compels the audience to analyze and wonder why Kane's life happened the way that it did, under the pretext of finding out what "Rosebud" means. The film then returns to the omniscient perspective in the final scene, when only the audience discovers what "Rosebud" is.&lt;ref name="watched"/&gt;{{Rp|82–83}}

The most innovative technical aspect of ''Citizen Kane'' is the extended use of [[deep focus]].&lt;ref name="Ogle"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ogle |first1=Patrick L. |last2=Nichols |first2=Bill |authorlink2=Bill Nichols |title=Technological and Aesthetic Influences Upon the Development of Deep Focus Cinematography in the United States |publisher=[[University of California]] Press |date=1985 |page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nearly every scene in the film, the foreground, background and everything in between are all in sharp focus. Cinematographer Toland did this through his experimentation with lenses and lighting. Toland described the achievement, made possible by the sensitivity of modern speed film, in an article for ''[[Theatre Arts (magazine)|Theatre Arts]]'' magazine:

&lt;blockquote&gt;New developments in the science of motion picture photography are not abundant at this advanced stage of the game but periodically one is perfected to make this a greater art. Of these I am in an excellent position to discuss what is termed "Pan-focus", as I have been active for two years in its development and used it for the first time in ''Citizen Kane''. Through its use, it is possible to photograph action from a range of eighteen inches from the camera lens to over two hundred feet away, with extreme foreground and background figures and action both recorded in sharp relief. Hitherto, the camera had to be focused either for a close or a distant shot, all efforts to encompass both at the same time resulting in one or the other being out of focus. This handicap necessitated the breaking up of a scene into long and short angles, with much consequent loss of realism. With pan-focus, the camera, like the human eye, sees an entire panorama at once, with everything clear and lifelike.&lt;ref name="Wellesnet Toland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=178 |last=Toland |first=Gregg |authorlink=Gregg Toland |title=The Motion Picture Cameraman |publisher=''Theatre Arts'', Wellesnet: The Orson Welles Web Resource |date=September 1941 |accessdate=September 21, 2013 |pages=646–654}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both this article and a May 1941 ''Life'' magazine article with illustrated examples&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 26, 1941 |title=Orson Welles: Once a Child Prodigy, He Has Never Quite Grown Up |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0wEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA108 |journal=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |pages=108–116 |accessdate=December 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped popularize deep focus cinematography and Toland's achievements on the film.&lt;ref name="Minding"/&gt;{{Rp|73}}

Another unorthodox method used in the film was the way [[low-angle shot]]s were used to display a point of view facing upwards, thus allowing ceilings to be shown in the background of several scenes. Breaking with studio convention, every set was built with a ceiling&lt;ref name="Wellesnet Toland"/&gt;—many constructed of fabric that ingeniously concealed microphones.&lt;ref name="Ebert Viewer's Companion"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/a-viewers-companion-to-citizen-kane |title=A Viewer's Companion to Citizen Kane |last=Ebert |first=Roger |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=January 1, 2004 |website=Roger Ebert's Journal |accessdate=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles felt that the camera should show what the eyes see, and that it was a bad theatrical convention to pretend there was no ceiling—"a big lie in order to get all those terrible lights up there," he said. He became fascinated with the look of low angles, which made even dull interiors look interesting. One extremely low angle is used to photograph the encounter between Kane and Leland after Kane loses the election. A hole was dug for the camera, which required drilling into the concrete floor.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|61–62}}

Welles credited Toland on the same [[title card]] as himself and said "It's impossible to say how much I owe to Gregg. He was superb."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|59}}{{efn|Speaking of the credit given Toland, Welles said, "Nobody in those days—only the stars, the director, and the producer—got separate cards.

===Sound===
''Citizen Kane''{{'}}s sound was recorded by Bailey Fesler and re-recorded in post-production by audio engineer [[James G. Stewart]],&lt;ref name="Mulvey"/&gt;{{Rp|85}} both of whom had worked in radio.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|102}} Stewart said that Hollywood films never deviated from a basic pattern of how sound could be recorded or used, but with Welles "deviation from the pattern was possible because he demanded it."&lt;ref name="BBC Complete"/&gt; Although the film is known for its complex soundtrack, much of the audio is heard as it was recorded by Fesler and without manipulation.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|102}}

Welles used techniques from radio like overlapping dialogue. The scene in which characters sing "Oh, Mr. Kane" was especially complicated and required mixing several soundtracks together.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|104}} He also used different "sound perspectives" to create the illusion of distances,&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|101}} such as in scenes at Xanadu where characters speak to each other at far distances.&lt;ref name="BBC Complete"/&gt; Welles experimented with sound in post-production, creating audio montages,&lt;ref name="Schatz"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schatz |first1=Thomas |last2=Harpole |first2=Charles (editor) |title=History of the American Cinema, volume 6: Boom and bust, the American cinema in the 1940s |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London |date=1997 |isbn=0-520-22130-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|94}} and chose to create all of the sound effects for the film instead of using RKO's library of sound effects.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|100}}

Welles used an aural technique from radio called the "lightning-mix". Welles used this technique to link complex [[film editing|montage]] sequences via a series of related sounds or phrases. For example, Kane grows from a child into a young man in just two shots. As Thatcher hands eight-year-old Kane a sled and wishes him a Merry Christmas, the sequence suddenly jumps to a shot of Thatcher fifteen years later, completing the sentence he began in both the previous shot and the chronological past. Other radio techniques include using a number of voices, each saying a sentence or sometimes merely a fragment of a sentence, and splicing the dialogue together in quick succession, such as the projection room scene.&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=David A. |title=A History of Narrative Film |publisher=[[W.

Film critic and director [[François Truffaut]] wrote that "Before ''Kane'', nobody in Hollywood knew how to set music properly in movies. ''Kane'' was the first, in fact the only, great film that uses radio techniques.&amp;nbsp;... A lot of filmmakers know enough to follow [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Auguste Renoir]]'s advice to fill the eyes with images at all costs, but only Orson Welles understood that the sound track had to be filled in the same way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thedancingimage.blogspot.com/2009/06/three-by-truffaut.html |last1=Truffaut |first1=François |authorlink1=François Truffaut |last2=Mayhew |first2=Leonard (translator) |title=The Films in My Life |publisher=''Simon and Schuster'' |location=New York |date=1978 |isbn=0-306-80599-5 |page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cedric Belfrage]] of ''The Clipper'' wrote "of all of the delectable flavours that linger on the palate after seeing ''Kane'', the use of sound is the strongest."&lt;ref name="Wakeman"/&gt;{{Rp|1171}}

===Make-up===
The make-up for ''Citizen Kane'' was created and applied by Maurice Seiderman (1907–1989), a junior member of the RKO make-up department.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|19}} Seiderman's family came to the United States from Russia in 1920, escaping persecution.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Dick  |authorlink=Dick Smith (make-up artist) |date=October–November 1999 |title=Citizen Seiderman |url=http://mydigitalpublication.com/publication/?i=211197&amp;p=18# |journal=Make-Up Artist Magazine | issue=21 |pages=18–25 |accessdate=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|18}} As a child Seiderman had won a drawing competition and received an apprenticeship at the [[Moscow Art Theatre]],&lt;ref name="Higham"/&gt;{{Rp|157}} where his father was a wigmaker and make-up artist.&lt;ref name="Gambill"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gambill |first=Norman |date=November–December 1978 |title=Making Up Kane |journal=[[Film Comment]] |volume= 14| issue = 6 |pages=42–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|42}} In New York his uncle was a theatrical scenic painter, and he helped Seiderman get into the union.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|18}} He worked on [[Max Reinhardt]]'s 1924 production of ''[[The Miracle (play)|The Miracle]]'' and with the [[Yiddish Art Theatre]],&lt;ref name="Higham"/&gt;{{Rp|157}} and he studied the human figure at the [[Art Students League of New York]].&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|42}} After he moved to Los Angeles he was hired first by [[Max Factor, Sr.|Max Factor]] and then by RKO.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|19}} Seiderman had not been accepted into the union, which recognized him as only an apprentice, but RKO nevertheless used him to make up principal actors.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|19}}

"Apprentices were not supposed to make up any principals, only extras, and an apprentice could not be on a set without a journeyman present," wrote make-up artist [[Dick Smith (make-up artist)|Dick Smith]], who became friends with Seiderman in 1979. "During his years at RKO I suspect these rules were probably overlooked often."&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|19}} By 1940 Seiderman's uncredited film work included ''[[Winterset (film)|Winterset]]'', ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'', ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'', ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1940 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'' and ''[[Abe Lincoln in Illinois (film)|Abe Lincoln in Illinois]]''.&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|48}} "Seiderman had gained a reputation as one of the most inventive and creatively precise up-and-coming makeup men in Hollywood," wrote biographer Frank Brady.&lt;ref name="Brady"/&gt;{{Rp|253}}

On an early tour of RKO, Welles met Seiderman in the small make-up lab he created for himself in an unused dressing room.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|19}} "Welles fastened on to him at once," wrote biographer Charles Higham. "With his great knowledge of makeup—indeed, his obsession with it, for he hated his flat nose—Welles was fascinated&amp;nbsp;... Seiderman had an intimate knowledge of anatomy and the process of aging and was acquainted with every line, wrinkle and accretion of fat in aging men and women. Impatient with most makeup methods of his era, he used casts of his subjects in order to develop makeup methods that ensured complete naturalness of expression—a naturalness unrivaled in Hollywood."&lt;ref name="Higham"/&gt;{{Rp|157}}

"When ''Kane'' came out in script form, Orson told all of us about the picture and said that the most important aspect was the makeup," Seiderman recalled. "I felt that I was being given an assignment that was unique—so I worked accordingly. And there was a lot of work to do. Straight makeups were done in the makeup department by staff, but all the trick stuff and the principal characters were my personal work; nobody else ever touched them. They could not have handled it."&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|46}}

Seiderman developed a thorough plan for aging the principal characters, first making a plaster cast of the face of each of the actors who aged, except Joseph Cotten who was unavailable at that time. He made a plaster mold of Welles's body down to the hips.&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|46}}

"My sculptural techniques for the characters' aging were handled by adding pieces of white modeling clay, which matched the plaster, onto the surface of each bust," Seiderman told visual arts historian Norman Gambill. When Seiderman achieved the desired effect he cast the clay pieces in a soft plastic material&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|46}} that he formulated himself.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|20}} These appliances were then placed onto the plaster bust and a four-piece mold was made for each phase of aging. The castings were then fully painted and paired with the appropriate wig for evaluation.&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|46–47}}

Before the actors went before the cameras each day, the pliable pieces were applied directly to their faces to recreate Seiderman's sculptural image. Welles was allergic to Max Factor's gum, so Seiderman invented an alternative that also photographed more realistically.&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|46}} The facial surface was underpainted in a flexible red plastic compound;&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|43}} Cotten recalled being instructed to puff out his cheeks during this process. Later, seeing the results in the mirror, Cotten told Seiderman, "I am acting the part of a nice old gentleman, not a relief map of the Rocky Mountains." Seiderman replied, "You'd be surprised at what the camera doesn't see unless we place it within its view. How about some more coffee?"&lt;ref name=Cotten&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotten |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Cotten |title=Vanity Will Get You Somewhere |publisher=[[Mercury House (publishers)|Mercury House]] |location=San Francisco, CA |date=1987 |isbn=978-0-916515-17-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|43}}

The red ground resulted in a warmth of tone that was picked up by the sensitive [[panchromatic film]]. Over that was applied liquid greasepaint, and then finally a colorless translucent talcum.&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|42–43}} Seiderman created the effect of skin pores on Kane's face by stippling the surface with a negative cast he made from an orange peel.&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|42, 47}}

Welles was just as heavily made up as young Kane as he was for old Kane, and he often arrived on the set at 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|69}} Application of the sculptural make-up for the oldest incarnation of the character took three-and-a-half hours. The make-up included appliances to age Welles's shoulders, breast and stomach.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|19–20}} "In the film and production photographs, you can see that Kane had a belly that overhung," Seiderman said. "That was not a costume, it was the rubber sculpture that created the image. You could see how Kane's silk shirt clung wetly to the character's body. It could not have been done any other way."&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|46}}

Seiderman worked with Charles Wright on the wigs. These went over a flexible skull cover that Seiderman created and sewed into place with elastic thread. When he found the wigs too full he untied one hair at a time to alter their shape. Kane's mustache was inserted into the makeup surface a few hairs at a time, to realistically vary the color and texture.&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|43, 47}}

Seiderman made [[scleral lens]]es for Welles, Dorothy Comingore, George Coulouris and Everett Sloane, to dull the brightness of their young eyes. The lenses took a long time to fit properly, and Seiderman began work on them before devising any of the other makeup. "I painted them to age in phases, ending with the blood vessels and the ''Aurora Senilis'' of old age."&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|47}}{{efn|Seiderman's work with contact lenses in films led to a medical formula for soft [[contact lenses]] that he developed in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Maurice Seiderman, 82, Inventor and Hollywood Makeup Artist |publisher=''The New York Times'' |location=New York |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/22/obituaries/maurice-seiderman-82-inventor-and-hollywood-makeup-artist.html |date=July 22, 1989 |accessdate=January 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"Cotten was the only principal for whom I had not made any sculptural casts, wigs or lenses," Seiderman said. When Cotten's old-age scenes needed to be shot out of sequence due to Welles's injured ankle, Seiderman improvised with appliances made for Kane's make-up. A sun visor was chosen to conceal Cotten's low hairline&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|47–48}} and the lenses he wore—hastily supplied by a Beverly Hills ophthalmologist—were uncomfortable.&lt;ref name=Cotten/&gt;{{Rp|44–45}}

[[File:Citizen-Kane-Welles-Breakfast.jpg|thumb|right|Kane ages convincingly in the breakfast montage, make-up artist Maurice Seiderman's tour de force.]]
Seiderman's tour de force, the breakfast montage, was shot all in one day. "Twelve years, two years shot at each scene," he said. "Please realize, by the way, that a two-year jump in age is a bit harder to accomplish visually than one of 20 years."&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|47}}

As they did with art direction, the major studios gave screen credit for make-up to only the department head. When RKO make-up department head [[Mel Berns]] refused to share credit with Seiderman, who was only an apprentice, Welles told Berns that there would be no make-up credit. Welles signed a large advertisement in the Los Angeles newspaper:&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|22}}&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|48}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;THANKS TO EVERYBODY WHO GETS SCREEN CREDIT FOR "CITIZEN KANE"&lt;br&gt;AND THANKS TO THOSE WHO DON'T&lt;br&gt;TO ALL THE ACTORS, THE CREW, THE OFFICE, THE MUSICIANS, EVERYBODY&lt;br&gt;AND PARTICULARLY TO MAURICE SEIDERMAN, THE BEST MAKE-UP MAN IN THE WORLD&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|20}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"To put this event in context, remember that I was a very low man," Seiderman recalled. "I wasn't even called a make-up man. I had started their laboratory and developed their plastic appliances for make-up. But my salary was $25 a week. And I had no union card."&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|48}}

Seiderman told Gambill that after ''Citizen Kane'' was released, Welles was invited to a White House dinner where [[Frances Perkins]] was among the guests. Welles told her about the Russian immigrant who did the make-up for his film but could not join the union. Seiderman said the head of the union received a call from the Labor Department the next day, and in November 1941 he was a full union member.&lt;ref name="Citizen Seiderman"/&gt;{{Rp|22}}&lt;ref name="Gambill"/&gt;{{Rp|48}}{{efn|After becoming head of the RKO make-up department, Seiderman left in 1946 to help recreate faces for disfigured U.S. soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomas |first=Bob |date=January 31, 1946 |title=Hollywood News |newspaper=[[Laredo Morning Times|The Laredo Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sets===
Although credited as an assistant, the film's art direction was done by [[Perry Ferguson]].&lt;ref name="Mulvey"/&gt;{{Rp|85}} Welles and Ferguson got along during their collaboration.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|37}} In the weeks before production began Welles, Toland and Ferguson met regularly to discuss the film and plan every shot, set design and prop. Ferguson would take notes during these discussions and create rough designs of the sets and story boards for individual shots. After Welles approved the rough sketches, Ferguson made miniature models for Welles and Toland to experiment on with a [[periscope]] in order to rehearse and perfect each shot. Ferguson then had detailed drawings made for the set design, including the film's lighting design. The set design was an integral part of the film's overall look and Toland's cinematography.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|42}}

In the original script the Great Hall at Xanadu was modeled after the Great Hall in Hearst Castle and its design included a mixture of [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] styles.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|50–51}} "The Hearstian element is brought out in the almost perverse juxtaposition of incongruous architectural styles and motifs," wrote Carringer.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|54}} Before RKO cut the film's budget, Ferguson's designs were more elaborate and resembled the production designs of early [[Cecil B. DeMille]] films and ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]''.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|55}} The budget cuts reduced Ferguson's budget by 33 percent and his work cost $58,775 total,&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|65}} which was below average at that time.&lt;ref name="Schatz"/&gt;{{Rp|93}} To save costs Ferguson and Welles re-wrote scenes in Xanadu's living room and transported them to the Great Hall. A large staircase from another film was found and used at no additional cost.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|56–57}} When asked about the limited budget, Ferguson said "Very often—as in that much-discussed 'Xanadu' set in ''Citizen Kane''—we can make a foreground piece, a background piece, and imaginative lighting suggest a great deal more on the screen than actually exists on the stage."&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|65–66}} According to the film's official budget there were 81 sets built, but Ferguson said there were between 106 and 116.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|64}}

Still photographs of [[Oheka Castle]] in [[Huntington, New York]], were used in the opening montage, representing Kane's Xanadu estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oheka.com/film-photo-shoots.htm |title=Oheka Castle&amp;nbsp;– Film, Television and Photography Productions |publisher=Oheka.com |accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/04/06/nyregion/c-corrections-910389.html |title=Corrections |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=April 6, 1989 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson also designed statues from Kane's collection with styles ranging from [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Greek]] to [[Gothic art|German Gothic]].&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|61}} The sets were also built to accommodate Toland's camera movements. Walls were built to fold and furniture could quickly be moved. The film's famous ceilings were made out of [[muslin]] fabric and camera boxes were built into the floors for low angle shots.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|64–65}} Welles later said that he was proud that the film production value looked much more expensive than the film's budget. Although neither worked with Welles again, Toland and Ferguson collaborated in several films in the 1940s.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|65}}

===Special effects===
The film's special effects were supervised by RKO department head [[Vernon L. Walker]].&lt;ref name="Mulvey"/&gt;{{Rp|85}} Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot things like crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, the scene in which the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters, to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera [[Crane shot|craning]] upwards over the performance scene, then a [[wipe (transition)|curtain wipe]] to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with the scene of the workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of Xanadu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thomas |first1=François |last2=Naremore |first2=James (Editor) |title=Orson Welles's Citizen Kane: A Casebook |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK and New York |date=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KzCH4UgSUr8C&amp;pg=PA173 |isbn=978-0-19-515891-5 |accessdate=November 10, 2007 |page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some shots included [[Rear projection effect|rear screen projection]] in the background, such as Thompson's interview of Leland and some of the ocean backgrounds at Xanadu.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|88}} Bordwell claims that the scene where Thatcher agrees to be Kane's guardian used rear screen projection to depict young Kane in the background, despite this scene being cited as a prime example of Toland's deep focus cinematography.&lt;ref name="Minding"/&gt;{{Rp|74}} A special effects camera crew from Walker's department was required for the [[Close-up#Types of close-up|extreme close-up]] shots such as Kane's lips when he says "Rosebud" and the shot of the typewriter typing Susan's bad review.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|88}}

Optical effects artist Dunn claimed that "up to 80 percent of some reels was optically printed." These shots were traditionally attributed to Toland for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jewell |first=Richard B. |title=The Golden Age of Cinema. Hollywood 1929–1945 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford, UK |date=2007 |isbn=978-1-4051-6373-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|110}} The optical printer improved some of the deep focus shots.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|92}} One problem with the optical printer was that it sometimes created excessive [[graininess]], such as the optical zoom out of the snow globe. Welles decided to superimpose snow falling to mask the graininess in these shots.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|94}} Toland said that he disliked the results of the optical printer,&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|92}} but acknowledged that "RKO special effects expert Vernon Walker, ASC, and his staff handled their part of the production—a by no means inconsiderable assignment—with ability and fine understanding."&lt;ref name="Minding"/&gt;{{Rp|74–75}}

Any time deep focus was impossible—as in the scene in which Kane finishes a negative review of Susan's opera while at the same time firing the person who began writing the review—an [[optical printer]] was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|92}} However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of [[in-camera effect]]s, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera [[Matte (filmmaking)|matte]] shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|82}}

===Music===
[[File:Citizen-Kane-Welles-Showgirls.jpg|thumb|right|Incidental music includes the publisher's theme, "Oh, Mr. Kane", a tune by [[Pepe Guízar]] with special lyrics by Herman Ruby.]]
The [[Film score|film's music]] was composed by [[Bernard Herrmann]].&lt;ref name="stephensmith"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Steven C. |title=A Heart at Fire's Center: The Life and Music of Bernard Herrmann |publisher=University of California Press |location=Oakland, California |date=2002 |isbn=978-0-520-22939-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|72}} Herrmann had composed for Welles for his Mercury Theatre radio broadcasts.&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|63}} Because it was Herrmann's first motion picture score, RKO wanted to pay him only a small fee, but Welles insisted he be paid at the same rate as [[Max Steiner]].&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|72}}

The score established Herrmann as an important new composer of film soundtracks&lt;ref name="americancomposers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americancomposers.org/raksin_herrmann.htm |title=American Composers Orchestra&amp;nbsp;– David Raksin remembers his colleagues |publisher=Americancomposers.org |accessdate=January 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eschewed the typical Hollywood practice of scoring a film with virtually non-stop music. Instead Herrmann used what he later described as '"radio scoring", musical cues typically 5–15 seconds in length that bridge the action or suggest a different emotional response.&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|77–78}} The breakfast montage sequence begins with a graceful waltz theme and gets darker with each variation on that theme as the passage of time leads to the hardening of Kane's personality and the breakdown of his first marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanmusicpreservation.com/CitizenKanefilmscore.htm |title=70th anniversary of Citizen Kane and Bernard Herrmann's film score |accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmsite.org/citi4.html |last=Dirks |first=Tim |title=Citizen Kane, page 4 |publisher=filmsite.org |accessdate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herrmann realized that musicians slated to play his music were hired for individual unique sessions; there was no need to write for existing ensembles. This meant that he was free to score for unusual combinations of instruments, even instruments that are not commonly heard. In the opening sequence, for example, the tour of Kane's estate Xanadu, Herrmann introduces a recurring [[leitmotiv]] played by low woodwinds, including a quartet of [[alto flute]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmscorerundowns.net/herrmann/citizenkane.pdf |last=Wrobel |first=Bill |title=Herrmann's "Citizen Kane" |format=PDF |date=November 4, 2001  | accessdate=July 31, 2013|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Susan Alexander Kane's operatic sequence, Welles suggested that Herrmann compose a witty parody of a [[Mary Garden]] vehicle, an aria from ''[[Salammbô]]''.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|57}} "Our problem was to create something that would give the audience the feeling of the quicksand into which this simple little girl, having a charming but small voice, is suddenly thrown," Herrmann said.&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|79}} Writing in the style of a 19th-century French Oriental opera,&lt;ref name="NYT Herrmann"/&gt; Herrmann put the aria in a key that would force the singer to strain to reach the high notes, culminating in a high D, well outside the range of Susan Alexander.&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|79–80}} Soprano Jean Forward dubbed the vocal part for Comingore.&lt;ref name="americancomposers"/&gt; Houseman claimed to have written the libretto, based on [[Jean Racine]]'s ''[[Athalie]]'' and ''[[Phedre]]'',&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|460–461}} although some confusion remains since [[Lucille Fletcher]] remembered preparing the lyrics.&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|80}} Fletcher, then Herrmann's wife, wrote the libretto for his opera ''[[Wuthering Heights (Herrmann)|Wuthering Heights]]''.&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|11}}

Music enthusiasts consider the scene in which Susan Alexander Kane attempts to sing the famous cavatina "Una voce poco fa" from ''[[Il barbiere di Siviglia]]'' by [[Gioachino Rossini]] with vocal coach Signor Matiste as especially memorable for depicting the horrors of learning music through mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concertonet.com/scripts/review.php?ID_review=2748 |last=Kirshnit |first=Frederick L. |title=Champagne and Pomade |publisher=ConcertoNet.com |location=Paris, France |date=December 31, 2004 |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Herrmann said, "I was fortunate to start my career with a film like ''Citizen Kane'', it's been a downhill run ever since!" Welles loved Herrmann's score and told director [[Henry Jaglom]] that it was 50 percent responsible for the film's artistic success.&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|84}}

Some incidental music came from other sources. Welles heard the tune used for the publisher's theme, "Oh, Mr. Kane", in Mexico.&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|57}} Called "A Poco No", the song was written by [[Pepe Guízar]] and special lyrics were written by Herman Ruby.&lt;ref name="Herrmann Cues"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://folk.uib.no/smkgg/midi/soundtrackweb/herrmann/db/cuesheets/film_citizenkane.html |title=Cue Sheet: Citizen Kane |date=April 22, 1941 |publisher=The Bernard Herrmann Society |accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In a Mizz", a 1939 jazz song by [[Charlie Barnet]] and Haven Johnson, bookends Thompson's second interview of Susan Alexander Kane.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|108}}&lt;ref name="Herrmann Cues"/&gt; "I kind of based the whole scene around that song," Welles said. "The music is by [[Nat King Cole|Nat Cole]]—it's his trio."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|56}} Later—beginning with the lyrics, "It can't be love"—"In a Mizz" is performed at the Everglades picnic, framing the fight in the tent between Susan and Kane.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|108}} Musicians including bandleader [[Cee Pee Johnson]] (drums), Alton Redd (vocals), Raymond Tate (trumpet), [[Buddy Collette]] (alto sax) and [[Buddy Banks (saxophonist)|Buddy Banks]] (tenor sax) are featured.&lt;ref name="Meeker"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/ihas/loc.natlib.jots.200014490/default.html |title=Jazz on the Screen: A jazz and blues filmography by David Meeker |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |accessdate=February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the music used in the newsreel came from the RKO music library, edited at Welles's request by the newsreel department to achieve what Herrmann called "their own crazy way of cutting". The ''News on the March'' theme that accompanies the newsreel titles is "Belgian March" by [[Anthony Vincent Collins|Anthony Collins]], from the film ''[[Nurse Edith Cavell]]''. Other examples are an excerpt from [[Alfred Newman (composer)|Alfred Newman]]'s score for ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'' (the exploration of Xanadu), [[Roy Webb]]'s theme for the film ''[[Reno (1939 film)|Reno]]'' (the growth of Kane's empire), and bits of Webb's score for ''[[Five Came Back]]'' (introducing Walter Parks Thatcher).&lt;ref name="stephensmith"/&gt;{{Rp|79}}&lt;ref name="Herrmann Cues"/&gt;

===Editing===
[[File:Citizen-Kane-Welles-Warrick-Breakfast.jpg|thumb|right|Orson Welles and Ruth Warrick in the breakfast montage]]
One of the editing techniques used in ''Citizen Kane'' was the use of montage to collapse time and space, using an episodic sequence on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following each cut would look as if it took place in the same location, but at a time long after the previous cut. In the breakfast montage, Welles chronicles the breakdown of Kane's first marriage in five vignettes that condense 16 years of story time into two minutes of screen time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Costanzo Cahir |first=Linda |title=Literature into film: theory and practical approaches |publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]] |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-7864-2597-6 |pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Welles said that the idea for the breakfast scene "was stolen from ''[[The Long Christmas Dinner]]'' by [[Thornton Wilder]]&amp;nbsp;... a one-act play, which is a long Christmas dinner that takes you through something like 60 years of a family's life."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|51|date=June 2012}} The film often uses long dissolves to signify the passage of time and its psychological effect of the characters, such as the scene in which the abandoned sled is covered with snow after the young Kane is sent away with Thatcher.&lt;ref name="watched"/&gt;{{Rp|90–91}}

Welles was influenced by the editing theories of [[Sergei Eisenstein]] by using jarring cuts that caused "sudden graphic or associative contrasts", such as the cut from Kane's deathbed to the beginning of the ''News on the March'' sequence and a sudden shot of a shrieking bird at the beginning of Raymond's flashback.&lt;ref name="watched"/&gt;{{Rp|88–89}} Although the film typically favors mise-en-scène over montage, the scene in which Kane goes to Susan Alexander's apartment after first meeting her is the only one that is primarily cut as close-ups with shots and counter shots between Kane and Susan.&lt;ref name="Mulvey"/&gt;{{Rp|68}} Fabe says that "by using a standard Hollywood technique sparingly, [Welles] revitalizes its psychological expressiveness."&lt;ref name="watched"/&gt;{{Rp|88}}

==Themes==
===Political themes===
In her 1992 monograph for the [[British Film Institute]], critic Laura Mulvey explored the anti-fascist themes of ''Citizen Kane''. The ''News on the March'' newsreel presents Kane keeping company with Hitler and other dictators while he smugly assures the public there will be no war.&lt;ref name="McBride"&gt;{{cite book |last=McBride |first=Joseph |date=2006 |title=What Ever Happened to Orson Welles? A Portrait of an Independent Career |url= |location=Lexington, Kentucky |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |isbn=0-8131-2410-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|44}} Mulvey wrote that the film reflects "the battle between intervention and isolationism" then being waged in the United States; the film was released six months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, while President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was laboring to win public opinion for entering World War II. "Not only was the war in Europe the burning public issue of the time," Mulvey wrote, "it was of passionate personal importance to Orson Welles&amp;nbsp;... In the rhetoric of ''Citizen Kane'', the destiny of isolationism is realised in metaphor: in Kane's own fate, dying wealthy and lonely, surrounded by the detritus of European culture and history."&lt;ref name="Mulvey"/&gt;{{Rp|15}}

Journalist [[Ignacio Ramonet]] has cited the film as an early example of [[mass media]] [[Crowd manipulation|manipulation]] of [[public opinion]] and the power that [[media conglomerate]]s have on influencing the democratic process. Ramonet believes that this early example of a media mogul influencing politics is outdated and that "today Citizen Kane would be a dwarf. He owned a few papers in one country. The forces that dominate today have integrated image with text and sound and the world is their market. There are media groups with the power of a thousand Citizen Kanes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ramonet |first=Ignacio |authorlink=Ignacio Ramonet |title=Set the media free |publisher=''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' |location=Paris, France |url=http://mondediplo.com/2003/10/01media |date=October 2003 |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dedijer |first=Miki |title=The man behind Attac |publisher=''Dedijer Media AB'' |location=Stockholm, Sweden |url=http://dedijer.com/article_frames.asp?picts=1&amp;article=The_man_behind_Attac |date=2000 |accessdate=December 9, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304132406/http://dedijer.com/article_frames.asp?picts=1&amp;article=The_man_behind_Attac |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Media mogul [[Rupert Murdoch]] is sometimes labeled as a latter-day ''Citizen Kane''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2162658.stm |last=Walker |first=Andrew |title=Rupert Murdoch: Bigger than Kane |publisher=''[[BBC News]]'' |date=July 31, 2002 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tuccille |first=Jerome |authorlink=Jerome Tuccille |title=Rupert Murdoch: Creator of a Worldwide Media Empire |publisher=Beard Books |location=Washington D.C. |date=1989 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2mj1FcArTE8C&amp;pg=PR14 |isbn=978-1-58798-224-8 |page=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Pre-release controversy===
To ensure that Hearst's life's influence on ''Citizen Kane'' was a secret, Welles limited access to [[dailies]] and managed the film's publicity. A December 1940 feature story in ''Stage'' magazine compared the film's narrative to ''[[Faust]]'' and made no mention of Hearst.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|111}}

The film was scheduled to premiere at RKO's flagship theater [[Radio City Music Hall]] on February 14, but in early January 1941 Welles was not finished with post-production work and told RKO that it still needed its musical score.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|205|December 2014}} Writers for national magazines had early deadlines and so a rough cut was previewed for a select few on January 3, 1941&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} for such magazines as ''Life'', ''Look'' and ''Redbook''. Gossip columnist [[Hedda Hopper]] (and Hollywood correspondent for Hearst papers Louella Parsons' arch rival) showed up to the screening uninvited. Most of the critics at the preview said that they liked the film and gave it good advanced reviews. Hopper wrote negatively about it, calling the film a "vicious and irresponsible attack on a great man" and criticizing its corny writing and old fashioned photography.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|205|December 2014}} ''Friday'' magazine ran an article drawing point-by-point comparisons between Kane and Hearst and documented how Welles had led on Parsons.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} Up until this Welles had been friendly with Parsons. The magazine quoted Welles as saying that he couldn't understand why she was so nice to him and that she should "wait until the woman finds out that the picture's about her boss." Welles immediately denied making the statement and the editor of ''Friday'' admitted that it might be false. Welles apologized to Parsons and assured her that he had never made that remark.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|205|December 2014}}

[[File:Louella-Parsons-1937.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Film columnist and Hearst employee [[Louella Parsons]] was humiliated by ''Citizen Kane'' and made numerous threats to prevent the film's release.]]
Shortly after ''Friday''{{'}}s article, Hearst sent Parsons an angry letter complaining that he had learned about ''Citizen Kane'' from Hopper and not her. The incident made a fool of Parsons and compelled her to start attacking Welles and the film. Parsons demanded a private screening of the film and personally threatened Schaefer on Hearst's behalf, first with a lawsuit and then with a vague threat of consequences for everyone in Hollywood. On January 10 Parsons and two lawyers working for Hearst were given a private screening of the film.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|206|December 2014}} James G. Stewart was present at the screening and said that she walked out of the film.&lt;ref name="Directors in Action"/&gt;{{Rp|11}} Soon after, Parsons called Schaefer and threatened RKO with a lawsuit if they released ''Kane''.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} She also contacted the management of Radio City Music Hall and demanded that they not screen it.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|206|December 2014}} The next day, the front page headline in ''Daily Variety'' read, "HEARST BANS RKO FROM PAPERS."&lt;ref name="dailyvariety"&gt;{{cite news |title=Hearst Bans RKO From Papers |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'' |date=January 10, 1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hearst began this ban by suppressing promotion of RKO's ''[[Kitty Foyle (film)|Kitty Foyle]]'',&lt;ref name="Schatz"/&gt;{{Rp|94}} but in two weeks the ban was lifted for everything except ''Kane.''&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}}

When Schaefer did not submit to Parsons she called other studio heads and made more threats on behalf of Hearst to expose the private lives of people throughout the entire film industry.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|206|December 2014}} Welles was threatened with an exposé about his romance with the married actress [[Dolores del Rio]], who wanted the affair kept secret until her divorce was finalized.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|207|December 2014}} In a statement to journalists Welles denied that the film was about Hearst. Hearst began preparing an injunction against the film for libel and invasion of privacy, but Welles's lawyer told him that he doubted Hearst would proceed due to the negative publicity and required testimony that an injunction would bring.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|209|December 2014}}

''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' ran a front-page story on January 13 that Hearst papers were about to run a series of editorials attacking Hollywood's practice of hiring refugees and immigrants for jobs that could be done by Americans. The goal was to put pressure on the other studios to force RKO to shelve ''Kane''.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|111|date=April 2012}} Many of those immigrants had fled Europe after the rise of fascism and feared losing the safe haven of the United States.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|209|December 2014}} Soon afterwards, Schaefer was approached by [[Nicholas Schenck]], head of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]'s parent company, with an offer on the behalf of [[Louis B. Mayer]] and other Hollywood executives to RKO Pictures of $805,000 to destroy all prints of the film and burn the negative.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|111–112|date=April 2012}}&lt;ref name="thomson2001"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-greatest-story-ever-told-sixty-years-of-citizen-kane-682857.html |last=Thomson |first=David |title=The greatest story ever told: Sixty years of Citizen Kane |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |location=London |date=April 28, 2001 |accessdate=December 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once RKO's legal team reassured Schaefer, the studio announced on January 21 that ''Kane'' would be released as scheduled, and with one of the largest promotional campaigns in the studio's history. Schaefer brought Welles to New York City for a private screening of the film with the New York corporate heads of the studios and their lawyers.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|112|date=April 2012}} There was no objection to its release provided that certain changes, including the removal or softening of specific references that might offend Hearst, were made.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|112–113|date=April 2012}} Welles agreed and cut the running time from 122 minutes to 119 minutes. The cuts satisfied the corporate lawyers.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|113|date=April 2012}}

===Hearst's response===
Hearing about ''Citizen Kane'' enraged Hearst so much that he banned any advertising, reviewing, or mentioning of it in his papers, and had his journalists [[libel]] Welles.&lt;ref name="thomson2001"/&gt; Welles used Hearst's opposition as a pretext for previewing the film in several opinion-making screenings in Los Angeles, lobbying for its artistic worth against the hostile campaign that Hearst was waging.&lt;ref name="thomson2001"/&gt; A special press screening took place in early March. Henry Luce was in attendance and reportedly wanted to buy the film from RKO for $1 million to distribute it himself. The reviews for this screening were positive. A ''Hollywood Review'' headline read, "Mr. Genius Comes Through; 'Kane' Astonishing Picture". The ''Motion Picture Herald'' reported about the screening and Hearst's intention to sue RKO. ''Time'' magazine wrote that "The objection of Mr. Hearst, who founded a publishing empire on sensationalism, is ironic. For to most of the several hundred people who have seen the film at private screenings, ''Citizen Kane'' is the most sensational product of the U.S. movie industry." A second press screening occurred in April.&lt;ref name="Schatz"/&gt;{{Rp|94}}

When Schaefer rejected Hearst's offer to suppress the film, Hearst banned every newspaper and station in his media [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] from reviewing—or even mentioning—the film. He also had many movie theaters ban it, and many did not show it through fear of being socially exposed by his massive newspaper empire.&lt;ref name="Street, Sarah 1996"&gt;{{cite news |last=Street |first=Sarah |title=Citizen Kane |publisher=''History Today'' |date=March 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oscar-nominated documentary ''[[The Battle Over Citizen Kane]]'' lays the blame for the film's relative failure squarely at the feet of Hearst. The film did decent business at the box office; it went on to be the sixth highest grossing film in its year of release, a modest success its backers found acceptable. Nevertheless, the film's commercial performance fell short of its creators' expectations.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt; Hearst's biographer David Nasaw points out that Hearst's actions were not the only reason ''Kane'' failed, however: the innovations Welles made with narrative, as well as the dark message at the heart of the film (that the pursuit of success is ultimately futile) meant that a popular audience could not appreciate its merits.&lt;ref name="Nasaw"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nasaw |first=David |authorlink=David Nasaw |title=The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |location=Boston,MA |date=2000 |isbn=0-395-82759-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|572–573|date=April 2012}}

Hearst's attacks against Welles went beyond attempting to suppress the film. Welles said that while he was on his post-filming lecture tour a police detective approached him at a restaurant and advised him not to go back to his hotel. A 14-year-old girl had reportedly been hidden in the closet of his room, and two photographers were waiting for him to walk in. Knowing he would be jailed after the resulting publicity, Welles did not return to the hotel but waited until the train left town the following morning. "But that wasn't Hearst," Welles said, "that was a hatchet man from the local Hearst paper who thought he would advance himself by doing it."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|85–86}}

In March 1941 Welles directed a Broadway version of [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s ''[[Native Son]]'' (and, for luck, used a "Rosebud" sled as a prop). ''[[Native Son (play)|Native Son]]'' received positive reviews, but Hearst-owned papers used the opportunity to attack Welles as a communist.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|213|December 2014}} The Hearst papers vociferously attacked Welles after his April 1941 radio play, "His Honor, the Mayor",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/otr_freecompany |title=His Honor, the Mayor |publisher=Internet Archive |access-date=21 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; produced for The Free Company radio series on CBS.&lt;ref name="Bret Wood"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Bret  |authorlink=Bret Wood |title=Orson Welles: A Bio-Bibliography |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |date=1990 |isbn=0-313-26538-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|113}}&lt;ref name="Wellesnet His Honor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/?p=186 |title=Orson Welles defends American civil liberties in His Honor the Mayor |publisher=Wellesnet.com |date=August 4, 2007 |accessdate=December 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Welles described his chance encounter with Hearst in an elevator at the [[Fairmont San Francisco|Fairmont Hotel]] on the night ''Citizen Kane'' opened in San Francisco. Hearst and Welles's father were acquaintances, so Welles introduced himself and asked Hearst if he would like to come to the opening. Hearst did not respond. "As he was getting off at his floor, I said, 'Charles Foster Kane would have accepted.' No reply", recalled Welles. "And Kane would have you know. That was his style—just as he finished Jed Leland's bad review of Susan as an opera singer."&lt;ref name="Welles TIOW"/&gt;{{Rp|49–50}}

In 1945 Hearst journalist Robert Shaw wrote that the film got "a full tide of insensate fury" from Hearst papers, "then it ebbed suddenly. With one brain cell working, the chief realized that such hysterical barking by the trained seals would attract too much attention to the picture. But to this day the name of Orson Welles is on the official son-of-a-bitch list of every Hearst newspaper."&lt;ref name="Roberts"&gt;{{cite book |last=Roberts |first=Jerry |title=The Complete History of American Film Criticism |publisher=Santa Monica Press LLC |location=Santa Monica, CA |date=2010 |isbn=978-1-59580-049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|102}}

Despite Hearst's attempts to destroy the film, since 1941 references to his life and career have usually included a reference to ''Citizen Kane'', such as the headline 'Son of Citizen Kane Dies' for the obituary of Hearst's son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=King |first=Susan |title=Raising 'Kane' With Hearst : An 'American Experience' Recounts the Attempts of the Publishing Magnate to Quash a Film Masterpiece |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |location=Los Angeles, CA |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-01-28/news/tv-29475_1_citizen-kane |date=January 28, 1996 |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the Hearst estate agreed to screen the film at Hearst Castle in San Simeon, breaking Hearst's ban on the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chawkins |first=Steve |title=Family 'Citizen Kane' gets inside the castle |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |location=Los Angeles, CA |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/23/local/la-me-citizen-kane-20120123 |date=January 23, 2012 |accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release===
[[Radio City Music Hall]]'s management refused to screen ''Citizen Kane'' for its premiere. A possible factor was Parsons's threat that ''[[The American Weekly]]'' would run a defamatory story on the grandfather of major RKO stockholder Nelson Rockefeller.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|115|date=April 2012}} Other exhibitors feared being sued for libel by Hearst and refused to show the film.&lt;ref name="Leaming OW"/&gt;{{Rp|216|December 2014}} In March Welles threatened the RKO board of governors with a lawsuit if they did not release the film.

Schaefer managed to book a few theaters willing to show the film.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Count on Mr. Welles: he doesn't do things by halves.&amp;nbsp;... Upon the screen he discovered an area large enough for his expansive whims to have free play. And the consequence is that he has made a picture of tremendous and overpowering scope, not in physical extent so much as in its rapid and graphic rotation of thoughts.

A few reviews were mixed. [[Otis Ferguson]] of ''[[The New Republic]]'' said it was "the boldest free-hand stroke in major screen production since [[D.W.

In a rare film review, filmmaker [[Erich von Stroheim]] criticized the film's story and non-linear structure, but praised the technical style and performances, and wrote "Whatever the truth may be about it, ''Citizen Kane'' is a great picture and will go down in screen history.

Some prominent critics wrote negative reviews.

In his 1950 essay "The Evolution of the Language of Cinema", Bazin placed ''Citizen Kane'' center stage as a work which ushered in a new period in cinema.&lt;ref name=WIC&gt;{{cite book |last=Bazin |first=André |author-link=André Bazin |translator-last=Gray |translator-first=Hugh |orig-year=1950 |chapter=The Evolution of the Language of Cinema |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/Bazin_Andre_What_Is_Cinema_Volume_1#page/n32/mode/1up |title=What is Cinema? |publisher=University of California Press |location=Oakland, CA |publication-date=1967 |pages=23–40 |isbn=978-0-520-24227-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|37}} One of the first critics to defend motion pictures as being on the same artistic level as literature or painting, Bazin often used the film as an example of cinema as an art form&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|129}} and wrote that "Welles has given the cinema a theoretical restoration. He has enriched his filmic repertory with new or forgotten effects that, in today's artistic context, take on a significance we didn't know they could have."&lt;ref name=BazinatWork/&gt;{{Rp|236}} Bazin also compared the film to [[Roberto Rossellini]]'s ''[[Paisà]]'' for having "the same aesthetic concept of realism"&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|117–118}} and to the films of [[William Wyler]] shot by Toland (such as ''[[The Little Foxes (film)|The Little Foxes]]'' and ''The Best Years of Our Lives''), all of which used deep focus cinematography that Bazin called "a dialectical step forward in film language."&lt;ref name="Minding"/&gt;{{Rp|71}}

Bazin's praise of the film went beyond film theory and reflected his own philosophy towards life itself.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|125}} His metaphysical interpretations about the film reflected humankind's place in the universe.&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;{{Rp|128}} Bazin believed that the film examined one person's identity and search for meaning.

===Re-evaluation===
By 1942 ''Citizen Kane'' had run its course theatrically and, apart from a few showings at big city arthouse cinemas, it largely vanished and both the film's and Welles's reputation fell among American critics. In 1949 critic Richard Griffith in his overview of cinema, ''The Film Till Now'', dismissed ''Citizen Kane'' as "...&amp;nbsp;tinpot if not crackpot [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]."&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|117–118|date=April 2012}}

In the United States, it was neglected and forgotten until its revival on television in the mid-1950s. Three key events in 1956 led to its re-evaluation in the United States: first, RKO was one of the first studios to sell its library to television, and early that year ''Citizen Kane'' started to appear on television; second, the film was re-released theatrically to coincide with Welles's return to the New York stage, where he played ''[[King Lear]]''; and third, American film critic Andrew Sarris wrote "Citizen Kane: The American Baroque" for ''[[Film Culture]]'', and described it as "the great American film" and "the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since ''[[Birth of a Nation]]''."&lt;ref name="Sarris"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sarris |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Sarris |title=Citizen Kane: The American Baroque |publisher=''[[Film Culture]]'', number 9 |year=1956 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carringer considers Sarris's essay as the most important influence on the film's reputation in the US.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|119}}

During [[Expo 58]], a poll of over 100 film historians named ''Kane'' one of the top ten greatest films ever made (the group gave first-place honors to ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]''). When a group of young film directors announced their vote for the top six, they were booed for not including the film.&lt;ref name=empire&gt;{{cite news |last1=Newman |first1=Kim |authorlink1=Kim Newman |last2=Freer |first2=Ian |authorlink2=Ian Freer |last3=Fraser |first3=Rob |title=Citizen Kane |publisher=''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' |date=July 2003 |accessdate= |pages=146–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|152}}

In the decades since, its critical status as [[films that have been considered the greatest ever|the greatest film ever made]] has grown, with numerous essays and books on it including Peter Cowie's ''The Cinema of Orson Welles'', Ronald Gottesman's ''Focus on Citizen Kane'', a collection of significant reviews and background pieces, and most notably Kael's essay, "Raising Kane", which promoted the value of the film to a much wider audience than it had reached before.&lt;ref name="Carringer TMOCK"/&gt;{{Rp|120|date=April 2012}} Despite its criticism of Welles, it further popularized the notion of ''Citizen Kane'' as the great American film.

The cinematography influenced [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]''. Cinematographer [[Arthur Edeson]] used a wider-angle lens than Toland and the film includes many long takes, low angles and shots of the ceiling, but it did not use deep focus shots on large sets to the extent that ''Citizen Kane'' did.

However, by the 1960s filmmakers such as those from the French New Wave and [[Cinéma vérité]] movements favored "flatter, more shallow images with softer focus" and ''Citizen Kane''{{'}}s style became less fashionable. American filmmakers in the 1970s combined these two approaches by using long takes, rapid cutting, deep focus and telephoto shots all at once.&lt;ref name="Bordwell Thompson"/&gt;{{Rp|798}} Its use of long takes influenced films such as ''[[The Asphalt Jungle]]'', and its use of deep focus cinematography influenced ''[[Gun Crazy]]'',&lt;ref name="Bordwell Thompson"/&gt;{{Rp|389–390}} ''[[The Whip Hand]]'', ''[[The Devil's General]]'' and ''[[Justice Is Done]]''.&lt;ref name="Bordwell Thompson"/&gt;{{Rp|414}} The flashback structure in which different characters have conflicting versions of past events influenced ''[[La commare secca]]''&lt;ref name="Bordwell Thompson"/&gt;{{Rp|533}} and ''[[Man of Marble]]''.&lt;ref name="Bordwell Thompson"/&gt;{{Rp|747}}

Rosenbaum also points out how the film influenced [[Warren Beatty]]'s ''[[Reds (film)|Reds]]''. The film depicts the life of Jack Reed through the eyes of Louise Bryant, much as Kane's life is seen through the eyes of Thompson and the people who he interviews. Rosenbaum also compared the romantic montage between Reed and Bryant with the breakfast table montage in ''Citizen Kane''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan |title=Movies as Politics |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley and Los Angeles |date=1997 |isbn=978-0-520-20615-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|113–116, 300–302}}

It was simultaneously released on VHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/citizen-kane/oclc/48011082 |title=Citizen Kane (VHS tape, 2001)  |publisher=WorldCat |accessdate=November 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD was criticized for being "''too'' bright, ''too clean''; the dirt and grime had been cleared away, but so had a good deal of the texture, the depth, and the sense of film grain."&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2011/09/buy_the_citizen_kane_bluray.html |last=Kaplan |first=Fred |title=Buy the Citizen Kane Blu-ray |publisher=slate.com |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=December 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Welles's daughter Beatrice Welles sued Turner Entertainment, claiming the Welles estate is the legal [[copyright]] holder of the film. She claimed that Welles's deal to terminate his contracts with RKO meant that Turner's copyright of the film was null and void. She also claimed that the estate of Orson Welles was owed 20% of the film's profits if her copyright claim was not upheld. In 2007 she was allowed to proceed with the lawsuit, overturning the 2004 decision in favor of Turner Entertainment on the issue of video rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/31/business/fi-kane31 |title=Welles' daughter could get profit from 'Kane' |publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' |accessdate=August 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, it was released on [[Blu-ray]] and DVD in a 70th Anniversary Edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/movies/new-dvds-citizen-kane-going-places-birth-of-a-nation.html |last=Taylor |first=Charles |title=The New Season DVDs: Movies That Said, 'Look What I Can Do' |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=September 16, 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' called it "the Blu-ray release of the year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/10/20/PK8B1LGVAR.DTL |last=Johnson |first=G.

A 70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition added a third DVD with ''[[RKO 281]]'' (1999), an award winning [[Television film|TV movie]] about the making of the film. Its packaging extras included a hardcover book and a folio containing mini reproductions of the original souvenir program, lobby cards, and  production memos and correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/50668/citizen-kane/ |last=McQuain |first=Christopher |title=Citizen Kane (Blu-ray) |publisher=[[DVD Talk]] |date=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer for the US releases were scanned as [[4K resolution]] from three different 35mm prints and rectified the quality issues of the 2001 DVD.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"/&gt; The rest of the world continued to receive home video releasees based on the older transfer. This was partially rectified in 2016 with the release of the 75th Anniversary Edition in both the UK and US, which was a straight repackaging of the main disc from the 70th Anniversary Edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=1145 DVDCompare.net: ''Citizen Kane'' (1941) DVD]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdcompare.net/comparisons/film.php?fid=19703 DVDCompare.net: ''Citizen Kane'' (1941) Blu-ray]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorization controversy===
In the 1980s, ''Citizen Kane'' became a catalyst in the controversy over the [[film colorization|colorization]] of [[black-and-white]] films. One proponent of film colorization was [[Ted Turner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/movies/council-opposes-coloring-old-films.html |last=Molotsky |first=Irwin |title=Council Opposes Coloring Old Films |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=November 4, 1986 |accessdate=January 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose Turner Entertainment Company owned the RKO library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TBS acquires rights to RKO film and television library |publisher=''[[Business Wire]]'' |date=December 9, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Turner Entertainment spokesperson initially stated that ''Citizen Kane'' would not be colorized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Toole |first=Lawrence |title=No computer coloring for 'Kane' |publisher=''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' |date=December 18, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in July 1988 Turner said, "''Citizen Kane?'' I'm thinking of colorizing it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bawden |first=James |title=Colorful Turner sees ''Citizen Kane'' in a different light |publisher=''[[Toronto Star]]'' |date=July 28, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1989 it was reported that two companies were producing color tests for Turner Entertainment. Criticism increased when filmmaker Henry Jaglom stated that shortly before his death Welles had implored him "don't let Ted Turner deface my movie with his crayons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Turner-Says-It-s-Testing-To-Colorize-Citizen-Kane-/id-4c23402df90437fb0816882f7e22ff27 |title=Turner Says It's Testing To Colorize 'Citizen Kane' |publisher=''Associated Press'' |date=January 30, 1989 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1989, Turner Entertainment President Roger Mayer announced that work to colorize the film had been stopped due to provisions in Welles's 1939 contract with RKO that "could be read to prohibit colorization without permission of the Welles estate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/We-ll-Never-Know-If-Rosebud-Was-Red/id-3da27b3969212eb7885db3dbd81b597e |last=Antczyk |first=John |title=We'll Never Know If Rosebud Was Red |publisher=''Associated Press'' |date=February 14, 1989 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayer added that Welles's contract was "quite unusual" and "other contracts we have checked out are not like this at all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turner won't colorize 'Kane' |publisher=''[[United Press International]]'' |date=February 14, 1989 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner had only colorized the final [[Reel#Motion picture terminology|reel]] of the film before abandoning the project. In 1991 one minute of the colorized test footage was included in the BBC ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|Arena]]'' documentary ''The Complete Citizen Kane''.{{efn| The colorized ''Citizen Kane'' footage appears at approximately 1:17:00.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesnet.com/the-complete-citizen-kane-is-now-online/ |title=The Complete Citizen Kane' documentary is now online |publisher=Wellesnet |date=May 13, 2013 |accessdate=January 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colorization controversy was a factor in the passage of the [[National Film Preservation Act]] in 1988 which created the National Film Registry the following year. [[ABC News]] anchor [[Peter Jennings]] reported that "one major reason for doing this is to require people like the broadcaster Ted Turner, who's been adding color to some movies and re-editing others for television, to put notices on those versions saying that the movies have been altered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jennings |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Jennings |title=[[ABC World News|World News Tonight]] |publisher=''[[ABC News]]'' Transcripts, ''[[American Broadcasting Company]]'' |date=September 19, 1989 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Epilepsy]]''' can affect '''[[employment]]''' for a variety of reasons. Many employers are reluctant to hire a person they know has epilepsy, even if the seizures are controlled by medication. If the employee suffers a seizure while at work, they could harm themselves (but rarely others, contrary to popular belief) depending on the nature of the work. Employers are often unwilling to bear any financial costs that may come from employing a person with epilepsy, i.e. insurance costs, paid sick leave etc. Many people whose seizures are successfully controlled by a medication suffer from a variety of side effects, most notably [[drowsiness]], which may affect [[job performance]]. Many laws prohibit or restrict people with epilepsy from performing certain duties, most notably [[epilepsy and driving|driving]] or operating dangerous machinery, thereby lowering the pool of jobs available to people with epilepsy. Epilepsy sufferers are also prohibited from joining the armed forces, though they may work in certain civilian military positions.

Employment issues are responsible for 85% of the cost of epilepsy on society.&lt;ref name="William O. Tatum page 112"&gt;Epilepsy A to Z: A Concise Encyclopedia By William O. Tatum, Peter W. Kaplan, Pierre Jallon: page 112&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]], the median income for persons with epilepsy is 93% that of all persons. The unemployment rate for persons with epilepsy has been reported to be between 25% and 69%. The high school graduation rate has been reported at 64%, compared with an overall national average of 82%.&lt;ref&gt;The treatment of epilepsy: principles &amp; practice By Elaine Wyllie, Ajay Gupta, Deepak K. Lachhwani: page 1203&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
The following issues exist for people with epilepsy in their quest for and performance of employment:

===Barring from employment===
People with epilepsy may be barred from various types of employment, either by law, by company regulations, or by common sense, thereby lowering the pool of jobs available to the job seeker.&lt;ref&gt;Managing Epilepsy: A Clinical Handbook By Malcolm P. Taylor: page 114-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Those barred from driving by the laws of the land in which they reside cannot perform any jobs that involve operating a motor vehicle. Even if the patients are permitted by law to drive their own vehicle, they may be barred by local and national laws from driving a vehicle for the purpose of certain types of employment, such as getting a Commercial Driver's License or driving a school bus or being the engineer of a train (even if a person who has not had a seizure in a certain time period is not permanently banned, they may still have to be able to stay seizure-free for a year or more even without medication).&lt;ref name="Robert J. Gumnit page 174"&gt;Living Well with Epilepsy By Robert J. Gumnit: page 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Most countries bar those who have ever had a seizure from flying an aircraft, except perhaps for a private craft, especially if the aircraft in question is a commercial or military aircraft or is any type of jet, making a career in aviation or in space extremely unlikely (again, some people who have been seizure-free without medication for a considerable time period, usually at least a year, are allowed to fly- even jets- in some cases, if they can remain seizure-free for at least a year without using anticonvulsant drugs).&lt;ref name="Robert J. Gumnit page 174"/&gt;

Jobs involving the operation of dangerous machinery may pose a problem to people with epilepsy, including [[construction]] and [[industry|industrial]] work.&lt;ref name="Robert J. Gumnit page 174"/&gt;

Many places have laws barring those with epilepsy whose seizures are not entirely controlled from working in positions that involve a high degree of responsibility to the well-being of others. This includes [[police officer]]s, [[teacher]]s, and [[health care]] workers.&lt;ref name="Robert J. Gumnit page 174"/&gt;

===Occupational hazards===
There are many hazards that people with epilepsy, including those whose seizures are fully controlled by medication, face in the workplace. Those with active seizures face the obvious risk of loss of consciousness or muscle control, and those with side effects face diminished concentration or physical strength. Some of the hazards include:&lt;ref&gt;Epilepsy A to Z: A Concise Encyclopedia By William O. Tatum, Peter W. Kaplan, Pierre Jallon: page 113&lt;/ref&gt;
*Working near a body of water, a high-voltage power line, or at extreme heights
*Working with machines, equipment, or hazardous chemicals or materials that require care in their usage
*The supervision of other persons, where any lapse in such supervision may be hazardous

===Transportation===
Even if a person with epilepsy is able to safely perform job duties him/herself, many are limited where they can work if they cannot provide their own transportation to the job site. Since some cannot drive themselves to work, they cannot travel to a place of employment.&lt;ref&gt;Living Well with Epilepsy By Robert J. Gumnit: page 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Women with epilepsy: a handbook of health and treatment issues By Martha J. Morrell, Kerry L. Flynn: page 282&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people with epilepsy who cannot drive may also be unable to safely walk, use [[public transportation]], or otherwise independently travel safely due to their seizure risk, further preventing them from reaching a place of employment. Such persons may be at risk for suffering seizures while on or waiting for a public transport vehicle or while crossing the street.&lt;ref name="William O. Tatum page 112"/&gt;

===Stigma===
[[social stigma|Stigma]] alone can make it more difficult for people with epilepsy to find jobs. Even if one's seizures are fully controlled by medication, or if the condition has been completely cured by surgery, many employers are reluctant to hire a person with epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide By Orrin Devinsky: page 45&lt;/ref&gt;

United States law does not require an applicant for a job to disclose one's condition to the employer. If an applicant voluntarily reveals one's condition, the employer is only allowed to ask whether the employee requires any special accommodations, and if so, what types.&lt;ref name="eeoc.gov"&gt;http://www.eeoc.gov/facts/epilepsy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

If an employer learns of an epileptic condition ''after'' making a decision to hire an employee, the employer is not legally permitted to withdraw the decision to hire as a result of this information ''unless'' the employee's duties will pose a risk to public safety. If this is the case, the employer is permitted to require the employee to obtain information from a physician regarding this.

Federal law in the United States requires that federal government agencies and employers receiving federal funding cannot discriminate in hiring against a prospective employee with epilepsy unless the duties one would be performing can be unsafe with a seizure disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Living Well with Epilepsy By Robert J. Gumnit: page 218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special accommodations===
Employees who have epilepsy may require special accommodations from their employers. Although against the law, some employers may feel reluctant to provide these accommodations. Some special needs include:&lt;ref&gt;Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide By Orrin Devinsky: page 287&lt;/ref&gt;

====Safety====
*Safety shields around pieces of equipment (which should be considered standard for ''all'' workers)
*Carpeting on concrete or other hard floors

====Hours====
*Extra [[break (work)|breaks]] for one who is often drowsy or fatigued as a result of one's condition
*Extended breaks following a seizure, should one occur
*Days off from work in the event a longer recovery is needed

==Seizures while on duty==
According to the law of the [[United States]], an employer is permitted to inquire into an employee's epileptic condition if the employee suffers one or more seizures while on duty only if they affect safety or job performance.&lt;ref name="eeoc.gov"/&gt;

The employer is permitted to require the employee to take a leave of absence or reassign the employee until the issues are resolved if the seizures pose a threat to the safety of others.

==Epilepsy as a disability==
Depending on the severity, epilepsy can be considered a disability which makes employment very difficult or even impossible for many sufferers for a variety of reasons. Those with seizures that cannot be controlled may find themselves unable to perform job duties of any type because their consciousness is constantly interrupted by the seizures. The aftermath of an often unpredictable seizure may leave a patient too fatigued to work for a period of time, or may temporarily impair the patient's memory. Seizures may pose a hazard to the employee or others in the event the employee loses consciousness while performing certain duties. Even if the seizures are completely controlled by a medication, side effects, such as drowsiness or fatigue, may make the performance of duties impossible or more difficult. 

In the [[United States]], while the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] does not fully protect persons with epilepsy from discrimination in hiring practices, the [[Social Security Administration]] only considers people with epilepsy "disabled" and thereby eligible to receive benefits if the condition severely limits one or more major life activities.&lt;ref&gt;Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide By Orrin Devinsky: pge 283&lt;/ref&gt; Employment may be hard to find or perform for many people with epilepsy, but not all are eligible for government-sponsored disability payments.

To qualify, documentation to the [[Social Security Administration]] of an [[EEG]] detailing a typical seizure is required, though a normal diagnosis does not rule out benefits. A seizure diary, including times and dates of seizures, and the effects the seizures have had is required. A person may qualify either if the seizures themselves have debilitating effects, or if the drugs used to treat the disorder have side effects that make employment impossible or difficult.&lt;ref&gt;Epilepsy: Patient and Family Guide By Orrin Devinsky: page 308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Armed forces==
Many countries restrict people with epilepsy from joining their [[armed forces]].

In the United States, in order to enroll in military service in a combat role, one must be seizure-free since age 5 and off all medications.&lt;ref&gt;Living Well with Epilepsy By Robert J. Gumnit: pages 173-74&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]] people with epilepsy are automatically barred for life from joining the military.

'''Eric Benhamou''' (born in 1955 in [[Tlemcen]], [[Algeria]]) was the former CEO of [[3Com]] and Palm.

==Biography ==
Born in a sephardic Jewish family originated from [[Toledo, Spain]], he left [[Algeria]] in 1960 with his parents during Algeria's independence war. His family settled in [[Grenoble]], France, where he grew up and attended [[Lycée Champollion]]. He continued his studies in [[Paris]] and graduated with a "diplôme d'Ingénieur" from [[École nationale supérieure d'arts et métiers]] (Ai. 172), the youngest student to receive this degree, and subsequently was awarded a doctorate. In 1976, at the age of 20, he emigrated to the [[United States]] and enrolled at [[Stanford University]]. He was graduated with a [[Master of Science]].

===3Com and Palm ===
 
He worked as a software engineer for several years at [[Zilog]], a pioneer company in microprocessors, and worked on Z-Net, the industry's first microprocessor based local area network computer system. He went on to co-found [[Bridge Communications]] in 1981 which specialized in [[computer network]] technologies. He was vice-president when the company was acquired by [[3Com]] in 1987. Three years later, he became CEO of 3Com, a position he held between September 1990 and December 2000. Under his tenure, 3Com grew approximately 20 fold and became a Fortune 500 company. In the 90's, 3Com purchased some 30 other technology companies, the largest of which in 1997 was Chicago-based [[U.S. Robotics]]. He nurtured the internal start-up Palm Computing, and funded the development of what became the most successful handheld computer of the decade, the [[Palm Pilot]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iftf.org/what-we-do/who-we-are/advisory-council/eric-benhamou/ Institute for the Future - Eric Benhamou Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognitions ==
Considered an outstanding entrepreneur, he won the Nessim Habif prize in 1997 from École Nationale Supérieure d'Arts et Métiers. He served on PITAC, the US President'a Information Technology Advisory Council, appointed by President [[Bill Clinton]]. In 1998, he received the Medal of Honor of [[Ellis Island]] that rewards most meritorious U.S. immigrants.
 
After his tenures as CEO of 3Com and of Palm, he continued to serve as Chairman of both companies until their acquisition by Hewlett Packard in April 2010. He joined the board of [[Cypress Semiconductors]] in 1994 and became Chairman of the Board in 1998. He taught entrepreneurship at [[INSEAD]] from 2004 to 2009. He joined the board of Stanford University's School of Engineering and [[Ben-Gurion University]] of the [[Negev]]. In 2001, he co-founded the Israel Venture Network, a venture philanthropy organization, and served as its Chairman.

'''Federico Faggin''' (born 1 December 1941), is an Italian physicist, inventor and entrepreneur, widely known for designing the first commercial [[microprocessor]]. He led the [[Intel 4004|4004 (MCS-4) project]] and the design group during the first five years of [[Intel]]'s microprocessor effort. Most importantly, Faggin created in 1968, while working at [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], the [[Self-aligned gate|self-aligned]] MOS silicon gate technology (SGT) that made possible dynamic memories, non-volatile memories, CCD image sensors, and the microprocessor. In addition, he further developed at Intel his original SGT into a new methodology for random logic chip design that was essential to the creation of the world's first single chip microprocessor and all other early Intel microprocessors. He was co-founder (with Ralph Ungermann) and CEO of [[Zilog]], the first company solely dedicated to microprocessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://invent.org/inductee-detail/?IID=55 | title= "Inductee Detail" |website=National Inventors Hall of Fame | date=2016-07-25 | accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also co-founder and CEO of Cygnet Technologies and of Synaptics.

In 2010 he received the 2009 [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation]], the highest honor the United States confers for achievements related to technological progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.intel4004.com/2009_national_medal.htm | title = "The 2009 National Medal of Technology and Innovation" | accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Faggin founded the Federico and Elvia Faggin Foundation to support the scientific study of consciousness at US universities and research institutes. In 2015, the Faggin Foundation helped to establish a $1 million endowment for the Faggin Family Presidential Chair in the Physics of Information at [[University of California, Santa Cruz|UC Santa Cruz]] to promote the study of "fundamental questions at the interface of physics and related fields including mathematics, complex systems, biophysics, and cognitive science, with the unifying theme of information in physics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stephens|first1=Tim|title="Gift to UC Santa Cruz funds new presidential chair for physics of information"|url=http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/09/faggin-chair.html|website=UC Santa Cruz Newscenter|date=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federico Faggin has been a [[Silicon Valley]] resident since 1968 and is a naturalized US citizen.

==Education and early career==
Born in [[Vicenza]], Faggin received a ''[[laurea]]'' degree in [[physics]], ''[[summa cum laude]]'', at the [[University of Padua]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Gallippi| first = Angelo | title = ''Faggin, il padre del chip intelligente''| publisher = adnkronos libri|date = September 2002| location = Rome|page = 47|language = Italian| isbn=88-7118-149-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federico grew up in an intellectual environment. His father, Giuseppe Faggin,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Gallippi| first = Angelo | title = ''Faggin, il padre del chip intelligente''| publisher = adnkronos libri|date = September 2002| location = Rome|pages = 10|language = Italian| isbn=88-7118-149-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a scholar who wrote many academic books and translated, with commentaries, the Enneads of Plotinus from the original Greek into modern Italian. Federico manifested, from an early age, a strong interest in technology and decided to attend a technical high school in Vicenza: I.T.I.S (Istitituto Tecnico Industriale Statale) Alessandro Rossi, rather than follow the family tradition of classical studies.

=== Olivetti R&amp;D Labs ===
At age 19, after his graduation from I.T.I.S. Alessandro Rossi, a [[Istituto tecnico|technical high school]] in Vicenza, Federico Faggin took a job at [[Olivetti]], in Italy, where he co-designed and led the implementation of a small digital transistor computer with 4 K × 12 bit of magnetic memory (1960).&lt;ref name = "career"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.intel4004.com/faggin_career.htm | title = Federico Faggin Career Leading to the Design of the Intel 4004	
 | accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Olivetti R&amp;D was the environment where, a few years later, the Olivetti [[Programma 101]], the world's first programmable desktop electronic calculator, became a reality (1964). After this first work experience, Faggin  studied physics at the University of Padua and taught the electronics laboratory course for 3rd year physics students in the academic year 1965-1966.

=== SGS-Fairchild ===

In 1967 he worked at SGS Fairchild, now [[STMicroelectronics]], in Italy, where he developed SGS's first MOS metal-gate process technology [[MOSFET|MOS]] and designed its first two commercial MOS integrated circuits. SGS sent him to California in February 1968 and when Fairchild sold its interests in SGS-Fairchild, Faggin accepted a job offer from Fairchild to complete the development of the Silicon Gate Technology.

==Life and accomplishments in Silicon Valley==

=== Fairchild Semiconductor ===

The silicon-gate technology (SGT) is one of the most influential technology to have ever fueled the progress of microelectronics since the MOS transistor. Without the SGT the first microprocessor could not have been made in 1970-1971.

In February 1968 Federico Faggin joined [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] in [[Palo Alto]] where he was the project leader of the MOS Silicon Gate technology with [[self-aligned gate]], and the inventor of its unique process architecture.&lt;ref&gt;See also: Faggin, F., Klein, T., and Vadasz, L. (1968). ''Insulated Gate Field Effect Transistor Integrated Circuits With Silicon Gates''. Paper presented by Faggin at the IEDM Conference, 23 October 1968&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faggin, F., Klein T. (1970). Silicon Gate Technology.

It made possible the creation of semiconductor memories in 1969–1970, the first microprocessor in 1970–1971, and the first CCD and EPROM (electrically programmable read only memories) with floating silicon gates (1970-1971). The SGT replaced the incumbent aluminum-gate MOS technology and within 10 years was adopted worldwide, eventually making obsolete the original integrated circuits built with bipolar transistors.

===The Fairchild 3708===

At Fairchild, Faggin also designed the world's first commercial integrated circuit using Silicon Gate Technology with self aligned MOSFET transistors: the Fairchild 3708.&lt;ref name="electronics"&gt;{{Cite news|title= The New Wave: Silicon Gate IC's (cover) |format= [[JPG]]| date= 29 September 1969| publisher= [[Electronics (magazine)|Electronics]]| accessdate= 2012-04-18 | url= http://www.intel4004.com/images/elect_cov_pg1.jpg | at= [http://www.intel4004.com/images/elect_pg2_pg3.jpg pages 2 + 3] [http://www.intel4004.com/images/elect_pg4_pg5.jpg pages 4 + 5] [http://www.intel4004.com/images/elect_pg6_pg7.jpg pages 6 + 7]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3708 was an 8-bit analog multiplexer with decoding logic, replacing the equivalent Fairchild 3705 that used metal-gate technology. The 3708&lt;ref name="career" /&gt; was 5 times faster, had 100 times less junction leakage and was much more reliable than the 3705, demonstrating the superiority of SGT over metal-gate MOS. See also: Faggin, F., Klein T. (1969). "A Faster Generation of MOS Devices With Low Threshold Is Riding The Crest of the New Wave, Silicon-Gate IC's." Electronics, 29 Sept. 1969.&lt;ref name="electronics" /&gt;

=== Intel ===
[[File:Federico Faggin.jpg|right|thumb|Faggin at the Computer History Museum's 2009 Fellows Award event]]

Federico Faggin joined Intel from Fairchild In 1970 as the project leader and designer of the MCS-4 family, which included the 4004, the world's first single-chip microprocessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt1PCLZAPyk |title=Interview with Gordon Moore on First Microprocessor |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2014-02-19 |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fairchild was not taking advantage of the SGT and Faggin was burning with the desire of using his new technology to design advanced chips.

The 4004 (1971) was made possible by the advanced capabilities of the silicon gate technology (SGT) being enhanced through the novel [[random logic]] chip design methodology that Faggin created at Intel. It was this new methodology, together with his several design innovations, that allowed him to fit the microprocessor in one small chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last = Gallippi| first = Angelo | title = ''Faggin, il padre del chip intelligente''| publisher = adnkronos libri|date=September 2002| location = Rome|pages = 158–159|language = Italian| isbn=88-7118-149-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="intel1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intel4004.com/mrld.htm |title=The New Methodology for Random Logic Design |website=Intel4004.com |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single-chip microprocessor — an idea that was expected to occur many years in the future — became possible in 1971 by using SGT with two additional innovations: (1) "buried contacts" that doubled the circuit density, and (2) the use of bootstrap loads with 2-phase clocks—previously considered impossible with SGT— that improved the speed 5 times, while reducing the chip area by half compared with metal-gate MOS.

The design methodology created by Faggin&lt;ref name="intel1"/&gt; was utilized for the implementation of all Intel's early microprocessors and later also for Zilog's [[Z80]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Intel4004| publisher= Intel4004.com| url=http://www.intel4004.com/mrld.htm |accessdate=2012-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intel 4004 — a 4-bit CPU (central processing unit) on a single chip — was a member of a family of 4 custom chips designed for Busicom, a Japanese calculator manufacturer. The other members of the family (constituting the MCS-4 family) were: the 4001, a 2k-bit metal-mask programmable ROM with programmable input-output lines; the 4002, a 320-bit dynamic RAM with a 4-bit output port; and the 4003, a 10-bit serial input and serial/parallel output, static shift register to use as an I/O expander. 
Faggin promoted the idea of broadly marketing the MCS-4 to customers other than Busicom by showing to Intel management how customers could design a control systems using the 4004. He designed and built a 4004 tester using the 4004 as the controller of the tester, thus convincing Bob Noyce to renegotiate the exclusivity clause with Busicom that didn't allow Intel to sell 4004's to other customers.

In 2009, the four contributors to the 4004 were inducted as Fellows of the Computer History Museum. Ted Hoff, head of Application Research Department, formulated the architectural proposal and the instruction set with assistance from Stan Mazor and working in conjunction with Busicom's Masatoshi Shima.  However none of them was a chip designer and none was familiar with the new Silicon Gate Technology (SGT). The silicon design was the essential missing ingredient to making a microprocessor since everything else was already known. Federico Faggin led the project in a different department without Hoff's and Mazor's involvement. Faggin had invented the original SGT at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1968 and provided additional refinements and inventions to make possible the implementation of the 4004 in a single chip. With routine help from M. Shima, Faggin completed the chip design in January 1971.

=== Intel's early microprocessors ===

Faggin's silicon design methodology was used for implementing all Intel's early microprocessors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

'''The [[Intel 8008]]''' was the world's first single-chip 8-bit CPU and, like the 4004, was built with p-channel SGT. The 8008 development was originally assigned to Hal Feeney in March 1970 but was suspended until the 4004 was completed. It was resumed in January 1971 under Faggin's direction utilizing the basic circuits and methodology he had developed for the 4004, with Hal Feeney doing the chip design. The CPU architecture of the 8008 was originally created by CTC, Inc., to power the Datapoint 2200 intelligent terminal.

'''The Intel 4040''' microprocessor (1974) was a much improved, machine-code-compatible version of the 4004 CPU allowing it to interface directly with standard memories and I/O devices. Federico Faggin created the 4040s architecture and supervised Tom Innes who did the design work.

'''The [[Intel 8080|8080]]''' microprocessor (1974) was the first high-performance 8-bit microprocessor in the market, using the faster n-channel SGT. The 8080 was conceived and designed by F. Faggin and designed by [[Masatoshi Shima]] under Faggin's supervision.&lt;ref name = "contract"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.intel4004.com/images/8080_review.jpg | title = Exempt performance and salary Review | format=JPG | accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 8080 was a major improvement over the 8008 architecture, yet it retained software compatibility with it. It was much faster and easier to interface to external memory and I/O devices than the 8008. The high performance and low cost of the 8080 let developers use microprocessors for many new applications, including the forerunners of the personal computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | inventor1-last = Faggin |  inventor1-first = Federico | inventor2-last = Shima |  inventor2-first = Masatoshi | inventor3-last = Mazor |  inventor3-first = Stanley | title = MOS computer employing a plurality of separate chips | issue-date = 1977 | patent-number = 4010449 | country-code = US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Faggin | first = Faggin | title = The MOS silicon gate technology and the first microprocessors | journal = Rivista del Nuovo Cimento | volume = 38 | issue = 12 | year = 2015 | pages = 575–620 | url = https://www.sif.it/riviste/ncr/econtents/2015/038/12/article/0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Faggin left Intel at the end of 1974 to found Zilog with Ralph Ungermann, he was R&amp;D department manager responsible for all MOS products, except for dynamic memories.&lt;ref name="contract" /&gt;

=== Zilog ===
[[Zilog]] was the first company entirely dedicated to microprocessors started by Federico Faggin and Ralph Ungermann in November 1974. F. Faggin was Zilog's President and CEO until the end of 1980 and he conceived and designed the Z80-CPU and its family of programmable peripheral components.  He also co-designed the CPU whose project leader was M.Shima.&lt;ref&gt;Shima M., Faggin F., Ungermann, R. (1976).'' Z80: Chip Set Heralds Third Microprocessor Generation.'' Electronics, 19 August 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Z80-CPU was a major improvement over the 8080, yet it retained software compatibility with it. Much faster and with more than twice as many registers and instructions of the 8080, it was part of a family of components that included several intelligent peripherals (the Z80-PIO, a programmable parallel input-output controller; the Z80-CTC, a programmable counter-timer; the Z80-SIO, programmable serial communications interface controller, and the Z80-DMA, programmable direct memory access controller). This chip family allowed the design of powerful and low-cost microcomputers with performance comparable to minicomputers. The Z80-CPU had a substantially better bus structure and interrupt structure than the 8080 and could interface directly with dynamic RAM, since it included an internal memory-refresh controller. The Z80 was used in many of the early personal computers as well as in game consoles such as the [[ColecoVision]] and [[Game Boy]]. The Z80 is still in volume production in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.zilog.com/index.php?option=com_product&amp;Itemid=26&amp;task=parts&amp;familyId=20&amp;productId=Z84C00&amp;mpn=Z84C0006PEG&amp;mpnid=5565&amp;scrollmpn=1&amp;rootpage | title=Zilog |website=Zilog.com |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a core microprocessor in various systems on a chip.

'''The Zilog Z8 micro controller''' (1978) was one of the first single-chip microcontrollers in the market. It integrated an 8-bit CPU, RAM, ROM and I/O facilities, sufficient for many control applications. Faggin conceived the Z8 in 1974, soon after he founded Zilog, but then decided to give priority to the Z80. The Z8 was designed in 1976–78 and is still in volume production today (2017).

===The Communication CoSystem===
The Communication CoSystem (1984). The Cosystem was conceived by F. Faggin and designed and produced by Cygnet Technologies, Inc., the second startup company of Faggin. Attached to a personal computer and to a standard phone line, the CoSystem could automatically handle all the personal voice and data communications of the user, including electronic mail, data-base access, computer screen transfers during a voice communication, call record keeping, etc. The patent covering the CoSystem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4524244.html |title=United States Patent 4524244: Digital and Voice Telecommunication Apparatus |author=Faggin, Federico |date=18 June 1985 |work=FreePatentsOnline |publisher=USPTO |accessdate=8 August 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; is highly cited in the personal communication field.

===Synaptics===
In 1986 Faggin co-founded and was CEO of [[Synaptics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Interface Technology Synaptics | url=http://www.synaptics.com |accessdate=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1999, becoming Chairman from 1999 to 2009. Synaptics was initially dedicated to R&amp;D in artificial neural networks for pattern-recognition applications using analog VLSI. Synaptics introduced the I1000, the world's first single-chip optical character recognizer in 1991. In 1994, Synaptics introduced the touchpad to replace the cumbersome trackball then in use in laptop computers. The touchpad was broadly adopted by the industry. Synaptics also introduced the early touchscreens that were eventually adopted for intelligent phones and tablets; applications that now dominate the market. Faggin came up with the general product idea and led a group of engineers who further refined the idea through many brainstorming sessions. F. Faggin is a co-inventor of 10 patents assigned to Synaptics. He is chairman emeritus of Synaptics.

===Foveon===
During his tenure as president and CEO of [[Foveon]], from 2003 to 2008, Faggin revitalized the company and provided a new technological and business direction resulting in image sensors superior in all critical parameters to the best sensors of the competition, while using approximately half the chip size of competing devices.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Faggin also oversaw the successful acquisition of Foveon by the Japanese [[Sigma Corporation]] in November 2008.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Federico and Elvia Faggin Foundation===
Founded in 2011 the "Federico and Elvia Faggin Foundation" supports the scientific study of consciousness at US universities and research institutes.  The purpose of the Foundation is to advance the understanding of consciousness through theoretical and experimental research.  Faggin's interest in consciousness has his roots in the study of artificial neural networks at Synaptics, a company he started in 1986, that prompted his inquiry into whether or not it is possible to build a conscious computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fagginfoundation.org |title=Home |publisher=Faggin Foundation |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''glass cliff''' is the phenomenon of women in leadership roles, such as [[Women in business|executives]] in the corporate world and [[Women in government|female political election candidates]], being likelier than men to achieve leadership roles during periods of crisis or downturn, when the chance of failure is highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/women-often-put-charge-failing-companies/ | title=Why women are often put in charge of failing companies | work=PBS NewsHour | date=September 22, 2015 | accessdate=July 11, 2016 | author=Cooper, Marianne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susanne Bruckmüller and Nyla R. Branscombe, [https://hbr.org/2011/01/how-women-end-up-on-the-glass-cliff How Women End Up on the “Glass Cliff”] ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'', JANUARY–FEBRUARY 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
The term was coined in 2004 by British professors [[Michelle K. Ryan]] and [[Alexander Haslam]] of [[University of Exeter]], United Kingdom. In a study, Ryan and Haslam examined the performance of [[FTSE 100 Index|FTSE 100]] companies before and after the appointment of new board members, and found that companies that appointed women to their boards were likelier than others to have experienced consistently bad performance in the preceding five months.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8551.2005.00433.x/full|title = The Glass Cliff: Evidence that Women are Over-Represented in Precarious Leadership Positions|last = Ryan|first = Michelle K., and S. Alexander Haslam|date = 9 February 2005|journal = British Journal of Management|accessdate = 18 October 2014|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8551.2005.00433.x|pmid =|volume=16|pages=81–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work eventually developed into the identification of a phenomenon known as the glass cliff. Since the term originated, its use has expanded beyond the corporate world to also encompass politics and other domains.

== Overview ==
Ryan and Haslam's research showed that once women break through the [[glass ceiling]] and take on positions of leadership they often have experiences that are different from those of their male counterparts. More specifically, women are more likely to occupy positions that are precarious and thus have a higher risk of failure—either because they are appointed to lead organizations (or organizational units) that are in crisis or because they are not given the resources and support needed for success.&lt;ref name="exeter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psy.ex.ac.uk/seorg/glasscliff/|title=The Glass Cliff|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727233341/http://psy.ex.ac.uk/seorg/glasscliff/|archivedate=2011-07-27|accessdate=2015-08-04|publisher=University of Exeter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3755031.stm BBC NEWS | Magazine | Introducing... the glass cliff&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Extending the metaphor of the glass ceiling, Ryan and Haslam evoked the notion of the "glass cliff" to refer to a danger which involves exposure to risk of falling but which is not readily apparent.&lt;ref name="exeter" /&gt; [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] tenure is typically shorter at companies which are struggling, compared to those which are stable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/aug/05/fortune-500-companies-crisis-woman-ceo-yahoo-xerox-jc-penny-economy|title = Women CEOs: Why companies in crisis hire minorities - and then fire them|last = McCullough|first = DG|date = 8 August 2014|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The glass cliff concept has also been used to describe [[employment discrimination]] experienced by leaders who are members of minorities or disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cook, A.|first=A.|author2=Glass, C.|title=Glass Cliffs and Organizational Saviors: Barriers to Minority Leadership in Work Organizations?|journal=Social Problems|volume=60|issue=2|pages=168–187|doi=10.1525/sp.2013.11147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of the glass cliff phenomenon has been documented in the field of law. A 2006 study found law students were much likelier to assign a high-risk case to a female lead counsel rather than a male one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmjowl/vol13/iss3/5/|title = Legal work and the Glass Cliff: Evidence that Women Are Preferentially Selected to Lead Problematic Cases|last = Ashby|first = Julie S.; Haslam, S.

Other research has failed to confirm the existence of glass cliff phenomenon. A 2007 study of corporate performance preceding CEO appointments showed that women executives are no more likely to be selected for precarious leadership positions than males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=Susan |title=Are Female Executives Over-represented in Precarious Leadership Positions? |journal=British Journal of Management |volume=20 |issue=1 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8551.2007.00549.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8551.2007.00549.x/abstract |accessdate=13 July 2015 |pages=1–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanation ==
Many theories have been advanced to explain the existence of the glass cliff.

[[University of Houston]] psychology professor [[Kristin J. Anderson]] says companies may offer glass cliff positions to women because they consider women "more expendable and better scapegoats." She says the organizations that offer women tough jobs believe they win either way: if the woman succeeds, the company is better off. If she fails, the company is no worse off, she can be blamed, the company gets credit for having been egalitarian and progressive, and can return to its prior practice of appointing men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.trust.org/item/20131103084828-93enz?view=print|title = When Wall Street Needs Scapegoats, Women Beware|last = Rivers|first = Caryl, and Rosalind C. Barnett|date = 2 November 2013|work = Women's eNews|accessdate = 18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haslam and Ryan say their studies show that people believe women are better-suited to lead stressed, unhappy companies because they are felt to be more nurturing, creative, and intuitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://blog.aelios.com/mbawg/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/The-glass-cliff.pdf |title=The road to the glass cliff: Differences in the perceived suitability of men and women for leadership positions in succeeding and failing organizations |last=Haslam |first=S.

Alexander |last3=Hersby |first3=Mette D. |last4=Bongiorno |first4=Renata|date = May 2011|journal = Journal of Applied Psychology|doi = 10.1037/a0022133|pmid = 21171729|volume=96|issue=3|pages=470–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haslam has said that women executives are likelier than men to accept glass cliff positions because they do not have access to the high-quality information and support that would ordinarily warn executives away.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Utah State University]] professors Ali Cook and Christy Glass say women and other minorities view risky job offers as the only chance they are likely to get.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2007 study found that female news consumers in the United Kingdom were likelier than male ones to accept that the glass cliff exists and is dangerous and unfair to women executives. Female study participants attributed the existence of the glass cliff to a lack of other opportunities for women executives, [[sexism]], and men's [[in-group favoritism]]. Male study participants said that women are less suited than men to difficult leadership roles or strategic decision-making, or that the glass cliff is unrelated to gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/09534810710724748|title = Reactions to the glass cliff: Gender differences in the explanations for the precariousness of women's leadership positions|last = Ryan|first = Michelle K., and S.

== Implications for women executives ==
Glass cliff positions risk hurting the women executives' reputations and career prospects because, when a company does poorly, people tend to blame its leadership without taking into account situational or contextual variables.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Researchers have found that female leaders find it harder than male ones to get second chances once they have failed due to having fewer mentors and sponsors and less access to a protective "[[Old boy network|old boys' network]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://blogs.hbr.org/2008/08/are-women-leaders-often-set-up/|title = The Glass Cliff: Are Women Leaders Often Set Up to Fail?|last = Hewlett|first = Sylvia Ann|date = 5 August 2008|work = Harvard Business Review|accessdate = 18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some researchers argue that companies in bad situations offer more opportunity for power and influence compared with companies that are stable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Examples ==
News media have described the following as examples of the glass cliff.
* In 1993, the Canadian [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative Party]], facing low approval ratings and almost assured loss in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|upcoming general elections]], elected [[Kim Campbell]], then [[Defense minister|Defense Minister]], to replace [[Brian Mulroney]] as its leader. The election dealt the Progressive Conservatives one of the most devastating defeats in Canadian history, reducing them from 156 seats to 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/caroline-simard/women-in-leadership-and-t_b_776291.html|title = Women in Leadership and the Glass Cliff|last = Simard|first = Caroline|date = 29 October 2010|work = Huffington Post|accessdate = 18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2014, [[General Motors]] hired [[Mary Barra]] as CEO, during a period in which it announced a number of product recalls.

==Controversies==
On 8 February 2016, deputy Yehor Firsov left the parliamentary faction of the [[Petro Poroshenko Bloc "Solidarity"|Petro Poroshenko Bloc]] in the [[Verkhovna Rada]] because of position in the conflict between the [[Ministry of Economic Development and Trade (Ukraine)|Minister of Economic Development]] [[Aivaras Abromavičius]] and Ihor Kononenko.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://glavcom.ua/interviews/331139-egor-firsov-to-li-prezident-ne-razobralsja-v-situatsii-to-li-on-budet-pokryvat-kononenko-do-poslednego.html | title = Егор Фирсов: То ли президент не разобрался в ситуации, то ли он будет покрывать Кононенко до последнего | publisher = Glavcom.ua | author = Pavlo Vuyetsʹ | date = 12 February 2016 | accessdate = 28 August 2018 | language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firsov also said that he does not want to remain in the party and the faction whose leaders are engaged in "corrupt activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://rian.com.ua/politics/20160208/1004864556.html | title = Нардеп Фирсов вышел из БПП «из-за коррупции и Кононенко» | publisher = ''[[RIA Novosti]] Ukraine'' | date = 8 February 2016 | accessdate = 28 August 2018 | language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://lb.ua/news/2016/02/08/327400_nardep_firsov_vishel_bpp.html | title = Нардеп Фирсов вышел из БПП | publisher = LB.ua | date = 8 February 2016 | accessdate = 28 August 2018 | language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 2016, journalist and People's deputy [[Serhiy Leshchenko]] said that the issue is being discussed in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States of America|United States]] about putting Kononenko under sanctions. "I am concerned about the possibility of Mr. Kononenko in the future to freely travel around the world and dispose of his money, because the issue of international sanctions regarding him is no longer a joke, but seriously negotiated in European capitals," Leshchenko said.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://strana.ua/news/18187-v-evrope-uzhe-obsuzhdaetsya-primenenie-sankcij-k-blizhajshemu-soratniku-poroshenko.html | title = В Европе уже обсуждается применение санкций к ближайшему соратнику Порошенко | publisher = Strana.ua | date = 15 June 2016 | accessdate = 2 August 2018 | language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://112.ua/politika/leshhenko-v-evrope-uzhe-obsuzhdayut-sankcii-protiv-kononenko-318613.html | title = Лещенко: В Европе уже обсуждают санкции против Кононенко | publisher = ''[[112 Ukraine]]'' | date = 15 June 2016 | accessdate = 2 August 2018 | language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://izvestia.kiev.ua/article/93035 | title = США и Британия могут арестовать счета и отменить визы близкому к Порошенко олигарху | publisher = ''Political Izvestia in Ukraine'' | date = 15 June 2016 | accessdate = 2 August 2018 | language = ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2016, Serhiy Leshchenko blamed Ihor Kononenko, [[Alexander Granovskiy]] and [[Mykola Martynenko]] for organizing an information attack on him, which consisted in disclosing confidential information about the purchase of his apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://strana.ua/news/32360-leshenko-zayavil-chto-za-antikorrupcionerami-vedetsya-nezakonnaya-slezhka.html | title = Лещенко заявил, что его атакуют Кононенко, Грановский и примкнувший к ним Мартыненко | publisher = Strana.ua | language = ru | date = 19 September 2016 | accessdate = 6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://ru.tsn.ua/politika/leschenko-pozhalovalsya-na-slezhku-i-nameknul-na-lyudey-iz-okruzheniya-poroshenko-713954.html | title = Лещенко пожаловался на слежку и намекнул на людей из окружения Порошенко | publisher = ''TSN'' | language = ru | date = 19 September 2016 | accessdate = 6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.pravda.com.ua/rus/news/2016/09/19/7121117/ | title = Лещенко: За антикоррупционерами ведется слежка | publisher = ''[[Ukrayinska Pravda]]'' | language = ru | date = 19 September 2016 | accessdate = 6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier, in March of the same year, Leshchenko told the media that President Petro Poroshenko personally asked him not to write articles on "members of his family", to which he attributed [[Viktor Shokin]] and Ihor Kononenko: "Last time when he proposed not to write about Shokin and Kononenko, he said that they were members of his family; that, in principle, he supports my criticism of [[Ihor Kolomoyskyi|Kolomoyskyi]], but if I write about the man of his family, I must ask his opinion. I asked who he had in mind. I do not touch his wife."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://strana.ua/news/6368-poroshenko-rekomendoval-leshenko-ne-pisat-o-shokine-i-kononenko.html | title = Порошенко просил Лещенко не писать о Шокине и Кононенко | publisher = Strana.ua | language = ru | date = 29 March 2016 | accessdate = 13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://podrobnosti.ua/2098520-poroshenko-prosil-leschenko-ne-kritikovat-chlenov-ego-semi.html | title = Порошенко просил Лещенко не критиковать членов его семьи | publisher = Podrobnosti.ua | language = ru | date = 29 March 2016 | accessdate = 13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, the former [[President of Georgia]] and ex-Governor of Ukraine's [[Odessa Oblast]], [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], accused Ihor Kononenko and his colleague [[Alexander Granovskiy]] for being instructed by president [[Petro Poroshenko]] to prepare the question of depriving of his citizenship of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://strana.ua/news/40903-saakashvili-zayavil-chto-ego-hotyat-lishit-ukrainskogo-grazhdanstva.html | title = Михо заявил, что банда «Порошенко-Кононенко» хочет лишить его украинского гражданства | publisher = Strana.ua | language = ru | date = 17 November 2016 | accessdate = 17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/3790601 | title = Саакашвили узнал о намерении Порошенко лишить его гражданства | publisher = ''[[TASS]]'' | language = ru | date = 17 November 2016 | accessdate = 17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://gordonua.com/news/politics/saakashvili-horosho-informirovannyy-istochnik-soobshchil-mne-chto-poroshenko-poruchil-lishit-menya-grazhdanstva-cherez-sud-159449.html | title = Саакашвили: Хорошо информированный источник сообщил мне, что Порошенко поручил лишить меня гражданства через суд | publisher = gordonua.com | language = ru | date = 16 November 2016 | accessdate = 17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.rbc.ru/politics/17/11/2016/582ce04b9a794736e9dafe14 | title = Саакашвили рассказал о планах Порошенко лишить его гражданства Украины | publisher = ''[[RBK Group]]'' | language = ru | date = 17 November 2016 | accessdate = 17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The US imposed a financial transaction tax from 1914 to 1966. The federal tax on stock sales of 0.1 per cent at issuance and 0.04 per cent on transfers. Currently, the US has a very minor 0.0034 per cent tax which is levied on stock transactions. The tax, known as Section 31 fee, is used to support the operation costs of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC). In 1998, the federal government collected $1.8 billion in revenue from these fees, almost five times the annual operating costs of the SEC.&lt;ref name="madhyam"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.madhyam.org.in/admin/tender/Equitable%20Equity.PDF |title= Equitable Equity: India Introduces Securities Transaction Tax |page= 4 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120426011146/http://www.madhyam.org.in/admin/tender/Equitable%20Equity.PDF |archivedate= 2012-04-26 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Peter Anthony DeFazio]] proposed a new [[financial transaction tax]] for within the [[United States]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="calls for"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2009/12/defazio_calls_for_tax_on_high.html|title=DeFazio calls for tax on financial transactions but critics abound |author=Charles Pope |date=December 3, 2009 |work= |publisher= [[The Oregonian]], OregonLive.com|accessdate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first raised the idea earlier in 2009, and then officially introduced it as a bill on December 3, 2009.&lt;ref name=Page/&gt; The day he introduced the bill, DeFazio said, "The American taxpayers bailed out Wall Street during a crisis brought on by reckless speculation in the financial markets. . ... This legislation will force Wall Street to do their part and put people displaced by that crisis back to work."&lt;ref name="calls for"/&gt; The "bailout" he referred to was the US [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]], and the "crisis" he referred to was the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]]. The day the bill was introduced, it had the support of 25 of DeFazio's House colleagues.&lt;ref name="Page"/&gt;

* The tax on [[futures contract]]s to buy or sell a specified commodity of standardized quality at a certain date in the future, at a market determined price would be 0.02 percent
* [[Swap (finance)|Swaps]] between two firms on certain benefits of one party's financial instrument for those of the other party's financial instrument would pay a 0.02 percent tax
* [[Credit default swaps]] where a contract is swapped through a series of payments in exchange for a payoff if a credit instrument (typically a bond or loan) goes into default would also pay a 0.02 percent levy

To ensure the tax is appropriately targeted to speculators and has no impact on the average investor and pension funds, the tax will be refunded for:&lt;ref name="introduces"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defazio.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=531:defazio-introduces-legislation-invoking-wall-street-transaction-tax&amp;catid=60:2009-press-releases |title= DEFAZIO INTRODUCES LEGISLATION INVOKING WALL STREET 'TRANSACTION TAX'|author= |date= |work= |publisher=Website of Peter DeFazio |accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==
Criticism of this bill has included (1) a December 2009 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' op-ed by Burton G. Malkiel and George U. Sauter;&lt;ref name="Malkiel"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703558004574579903734883292|title=A Transaction Tax Would Hurt All Investors |author=Burton G. Malkiel and George U. Sauter |date=December 8, 2009 |work=Opinion Journal |publisher= [[Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2) a December 2009 online op-ed by Irene Aldridge;&lt;ref name="Aldridge"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://advancedtrading.com/regulations/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=VV4CMSCWEWTQJQE1GHPSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=222002855&amp;_requestid=4477 |title=Potential and Unintended Consequences of the Financial Transaction Tax |author=Irene Aldridge |date=December 21, 2009 |work= |publisher=Advanced Trading |accessdate=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (3) a December 2010 ''[[Tulane Law Review]]'' article by Richard T. Page, who has suggested that imposing a financial-transactions tax in response to the 2007-2010 economic downturn would be "foolish revenge".&lt;ref name="Page"/&gt;  Page has instead lent lukewarm support to President Barack Obama's [[Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee]].&lt;ref name="Page"/&gt;

===Criticism from Malkiel and Sauter===
On December 8, 2009, criticism came from Burton G. Malkiel and George U. Sauter. Some empirical researchers have expressed concern that financial transaction taxes would in practice become entirely [[Pass-through taxation|pass-through]], ultimately increasing [[transaction cost]]s for long-term [[investors]], rather than merely creating distortions and reducing market [[Financial market efficiency|efficiency]]. For instance, [[Princeton University]] Professor of Economics [[Burton G. Malkiel]], author of classic finance book [[A Random Walk Down Wall Street]] and several publications on mutual fund performance, predicted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Wall Street" would not foot the bill for the presumed $150 billion [transactions] tax. In fact, the tax would simply be added to the cost of doing business, ''burdening all investors'', including 401(k) plans, IRAs and mutual funds.&lt;ref name="Malkiel"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor Malkiel argued that taxing speculators would reduce market efficiency, harming the economy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Transactions taxes would make most current [[Algorithmic trading|high-frequency trades]] unprofitable since they depend on the thinnest of profit margins. Trading volume would collapse, and there would be a dramatic shortfall in the tax dollars actually collected by the government. [[Market liquidity]] would decline, [[bid-offer spread]]s would widen, and ''all investors would pay significantly higher costs on their trades''.&lt;ref name="Malkiel"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Criticism from Irene Aldridge===

On December 21, 2009, a financial industry representative, a managing partner at a New-York-based hedge fund and an author of a book on [[high-frequency trading]], Irene Aldridge, argued that a financial transaction tax proposed in the US would lead to job losses in non-financial sectors of the economy through the so-called [[multiplier effect]] forwarding in a magnified form any taxes imposed on Wall Street employees through their reduced demand to their suppliers and supporting industries:

&lt;blockquote&gt;100 financial security jobs are estimated to support 27 to 37 jobs in the retail sector, 72 to 91 jobs in the business services sector (think staples and copy machines), 79 to 112 jobs in the services sector (like dentists, nurses and gas station operators), and 5 to 12 restaurant and pub workers. Even the smallest FTT that reduces transaction volume by as little as 10% will, according to Schwabish, result in the loss of over 30,000 jobs just in NYC.&lt;ref name="Aldridge"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Irene Aldridge, there is also concern about the reduced return on investment for individuals, the higher spreads and volatility in the market, and possible increased banking fees, which will need to be increased in order for banks to cover the higher risk associated with holding stocks, all of which will have detrimental effects on the "main street".&lt;ref name="Aldridge"/&gt;

==Another bill introduced by DeFazio==

Another bill, which remains a proposal, was tabled by DeFazio on February 13, 2010. It is called "H.R.1068 - Let Wall Street Pay for Wall Street's Bailout Act of 2009."

'''Material requirements planning''' ('''MRP''') is a  [[production planning]], [[scheduling]], and [[inventory]] control system used to [[management|manage]] [[manufacturing]] processes. Most MRP systems are [[computer software|software]]-based, but it is possible to conduct MRP by hand as well.

An MRP system is intended to simultaneously meet three objectives:

* Ensure materials are available for [[manufacturing|production]] and [[product (business)|products]] are available for [[delivery (commerce)|delivery]] to customers.
* Maintain the lowest possible material and product levels in store
* Plan manufacturing activities, delivery schedules and [[purchasing]] activities.

== History ==
Prior to MRP, and before computers dominated industry, [[Reorder point|reorder point (ROP)]]/reorder-quantity (ROQ) type methods like [[Economic order quantity|EOQ (economic order quantity)]] had been used in manufacturing and inventory management.&lt;ref&gt;Uday Karmarkar, Getting Control of Just-in-Time, Harvard Business Review 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

MRP was created initially to supply the Polaris program then, in 1964, as a response to the [[Toyota Production System|Toyota Manufacturing Program]], [[Joseph Orlicky]] developed material requirements planning (MRP). The first company to use MRP was [[Black &amp; Decker]] in 1964, with Dick Alban as project leader. Orlicky's 1975 book ''Material Requirements Planning'' has the subtitle ''The New Way of Life in Production and Inventory Management''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Orlicky, Materials Requirement Planning, McGraw-Hill 1975&lt;/ref&gt; By 1975, MRP was implemented in 700 companies. This number had grown to about 8,000 by 1981.

In 1983, [[Oliver Wight]] developed MRP into [[manufacturing resource planning]] (MRP II).&lt;ref&gt;WJ Hopp, ML Spearman ''Commissioned Paper To Pull or Not to Pull: What Is the Question?'' Manufacturing &amp; Service Operations Management, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1980s, Joe Orlicky's MRP evolved into Oliver Wight's manufacturing resource planning (MRP II) which brings master scheduling, rough-cut capacity planning, [[capacity planning|capacity requirements planning]], S&amp;OP in 1983 and other concepts to classical MRP. By 1989, about one third of the [[software industry]] was MRP II software sold to American industry ($1.2 billion worth of software).&lt;ref&gt;IE. 1991. Competition in manufacturing leads to MRP II. 23 (July) 10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The scope of MRP in manufacturing ==

===Dependent demand vs independent demand===

Independent demand is demand originating outside the plant or production system, while dependent demand is demand for components. The [[bill of materials]] (BOM) specifies the relationship between the [[Product (business)|end product]] (independent demand) and the components (dependent demand). MRP takes as input the information contained in the BOM.&lt;ref&gt;J.Orlicky, Net Change Material Requirement Planning, IBM Systems J. 1973 in Jos Peeters, Early MRP Systems at Royal Phillips Electronics in the 1960s and 1970s, Annals of the History of Computing, IEEE 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="Ptak, Carol 2011" /&gt;

The basic functions of an MRP system include: [[inventory control]], [[bill of material]] processing, and elementary scheduling. MRP helps organizations to maintain low inventory levels. It is used to plan manufacturing, purchasing and delivering activities.

"Manufacturing organizations, whatever their products, face the same daily practical problem - that customers want products to be available in a shorter time than it takes to make them. This means that some level of planning is required."

Companies need to control the types and quantities of materials they purchase, plan which products are to be produced and in what quantities and ensure that they are able to meet current and future customer demand, all at the lowest possible cost. Making a bad decision in any of these areas will make the company lose money. A few examples are given below:

* If a company purchases insufficient quantities of an item used in manufacturing (or the wrong item) it may be unable to meet contract obligations to supply products on time.
* If a company purchases excessive quantities of an item, money is wasted - the excess quantity ties up cash while it remains as stock that might never be used at all.
* Beginning production of an order at the wrong time can cause customer deadlines to be missed.

MRP is a tool to deal with these problems. It provides answers for several questions:
* ''What'' items are required?
* ''How many'' are required?
* ''When'' are they required?...

MRP can be applied both to items that are purchased from outside suppliers and to sub-assemblies, produced internally, that are components of more complex items.

===Data===

The data that must be considered include:

* The ''end item'' (or items) being created. This is sometimes called independent demand, or Level "0" on BOM ([[bill of materials]]).
* How much is required at a time.
* When the quantities are required to meet demand.
* [[Shelf life]] of stored materials.
* Inventory status records. Records of ''net'' materials ''available'' for use already in stock (on hand) and materials on order from suppliers.
* Bills of materials. Details of the materials, components and sub-assemblies required to make each product.
* Planning data. This includes all the restraints and directions to produce such items as: [[routing]], labor and machine standards, quality and testing standards, pull/work cell and push commands, lot sizing techniques (i.e. fixed lot size, lot-for-lot, economic order quantity), scrap percentages, and other inputs.

===Outputs===

There are two outputs and a variety of messages/reports:

* Output 1 is the "Recommended Production Schedule." This lays out a detailed schedule of the required minimum start and completion dates, with quantities, for each step of the Routing and Bill Of Material required to satisfy the demand from the [[master production schedule]] (MPS).
* Output 2 is the "Recommended Purchasing Schedule." This lays out both the dates on which the purchased items should be received into the facility ''and'' the dates on which the [[purchase order]]s or blanket order release should occur in order to match the production schedules.

Messages and reports:
* [[Purchase order]]s. An order to a supplier to provide materials.
* Reschedule notices. These ''recommend'' cancelling, increasing, delaying or speeding up existing orders.

===Methods to find order quantities===

Well-known methods to find order quantities are:
* [[Dynamic lot-sizing]] 
* [[Silver–Meal heuristic]]
* [[Least-unit-cost heuristic]]

===Mathematical formulation===

MRP can be expressed as an [[optimal control]] problem:&lt;ref name="Zipkin2000"&gt;Zipkin Paul H., Foundations of Inventory Management, Boston: McGraw Hill, 2000, {{ISBN|0-256-11379-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{| cellpadding="2" style="border:1px solid darkgray;"
|- border=0;
| Initial conditions:
:&lt;math&gt;x'_{i}(0)=x'_{i0}&lt;/math&gt;    i=1,...,J
Dynamics:
:&lt;math&gt;x'_{i}(t+1)=x'_{i}(t)+z_{i}(t)-d'_{i}(t)-\sum_{j\epsilon Suc(i)}z_{j}(t+L'_{ij}-1)&lt;/math&gt; 
:t=0,...,T-1,i=1,...,J
Constraints:
:&lt;math&gt;x'_{i}(t)\geq0&lt;/math&gt;    t=1,...,T,i=1,...,J
:&lt;math&gt;z_{i}(t)\geq0&lt;/math&gt;    t=0,...,T-1,i=1,...,J
Objective:
:&lt;math&gt;min \sum_{i}\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\left[ k_{i}(t)\delta(z_{i}(t)) + c_{i}(t)z_{i}(t) \right]+\sum_{i}\sum_{t=1}^{T} h'_{i}(t)x'_{i}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Where ''x' '' is local inventory ([[state variable|the state]]), ''z'' the order size ([[control variable|the control]]), ''d'' is local demand, ''k'' represents fixed order costs, ''c'' variable order costs, ''h'' local inventory holding costs. δ() is the [[Heaviside function]]. Changing the dynamics of the problem leads to a multi-item analogue of the [[dynamic lot-size model]].&lt;ref name="Zipkin2000"/&gt;

== Problems with MRP systems ==
*Integrity of the data. If there are any errors in the inventory data, the [[bill of materials]] (commonly referred to as 'BOM') data, or the [[master production schedule]], then the output data will also be incorrect ("GIGO": [[garbage in, garbage out]]). Data integrity is also affected by inaccurate cycle count adjustments, mistakes in receiving input and shipping output, scrap not reported, waste, damage, box count errors, supplier container count errors, production reporting errors, and system issues. Many of these type of errors can be minimized by implementing [[Push–pull strategy|pull]] systems and using [[bar code]] scanning. Most vendors in this type of system recommend at least 99% data integrity for the system to give useful results.
*Systems require that the user specify how long it will take for a factory to make a product from its component parts (assuming they are all available).  Additionally, the system design also assumes that this "lead time" in manufacturing will be the same each time the item is made, without regard to quantity being made, or other items being made simultaneously in the factory.
*A manufacturer may have factories in different cities or even countries.  It is not good for an MRP system to say that we do not need to order some material, because we have plenty of it thousands of miles away.  The overall [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] system needs to be able to organize inventory and needs by individual factory and inter-communicate the needs in order to enable each factory to redistribute components to serve the overall enterprise. This means that other systems in the enterprise need to work properly, both before implementing an MRP system and in the future. For example, systems like variety reduction and engineering, which makes sure that product comes out right first time (without defects), must be in place.
*Production may be in progress for some part, whose design gets changed, with customer orders in the system for both the old design, and the new one, concurrently. The overall [[Enterprise resource planning|ERP]] system needs to have a system of coding parts such that the MRP will correctly calculate needs and tracking for both versions. Parts must be booked into and out of stores more regularly than the MRP calculations take place. Note, these other systems can well be manual systems, but must interface to the MRP. For example, a 'walk around' stock intake done just prior to the MRP calculations can be a practical solution for a small inventory (especially if it is an "open store").
*The other major drawback of MRP is that it fails to account for capacity in its calculations. This means it will give results that are impossible to implement due to [[manpower]], machine or supplier capacity constraints. However this is largely dealt with by [[Manufacturing resource planning|MRP II]]. Generally, MRP II refers to a system with integrated financials. An MRP II system can include finite or infinite capacity planning. But, to be considered a true MRP II system must also include financials. In the [[Manufacturing resource planning|MRP II]] (or MRP2) concept, fluctuations in forecast data are taken into account by including simulation of the master production schedule, thus creating a long-term control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Waldner  |first = Jean-Baptiste | author-link = Jean-Baptiste Waldner |title = CIM: Principles of Computer Integrated Manufacturing |publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons |place = Chichester | year = 1992| page = 46 |isbn = 0-471-93450-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more general feature of MRP2 is its extension to purchasing, to marketing and to finance (integration of all the functions of the company), ERP has been the next step.

===Solutions to data integrity issues===
Source:&lt;ref name="Ptak, Carol 2011" /&gt;

*Bill of material – The best practice is to physically verify the bill of material either at the production site or by disassembling the product.
*Cycle count – The best practice is to determine why a cycle count that increases or decreases inventory has occurred. Find the root cause and correct the problem from occurring again.
*Scrap reporting – This can be the most difficult area to maintain with any integrity. Start with isolating the scrap by providing scrap bins at the production site and then record the scrap from the bins on a daily basis. One benefit of reviewing the scrap on site is that preventive action can be taken by the engineering group.
*Receiving errors – Manual systems of recording what has been received are error prone. The best practice is to implement the system of receiving by ASN from the supplier. The supplier sends an ASN ([[Advance ship notice|advanced shipping notification]]). When the components are received into the facility, the ASN is processed and then company labels are created for each line item. The labels are affixed to each container and then scanned into the MRP system. Extra labels reveal a shortage from the shipment and too few labels reveal an over shipment. Some companies pay for ASN by reducing the time in processing accounts payable.
*Shipping errors – The container labels are printed from the shipper. The labels are affixed to the containers in a staging area or when they are loaded on the transport.
*Production reporting – The best practice is to use bar code scanning to enter production into inventory. A product that is rejected should be moved to an MRB (material review board) location. Containers that require sorting need to be received in reverse.
*Replenishment – The best replenishment practice is replacement using bar code scanning, or via pull system. Depending upon the complexity of the product, planners can actually order materials using scanning with a min-max system.

== Demand driven MRP ==

In 2011, the third edition of "Orlicky's Materials Requirements Planning&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Orlicky's Materials Requirements Planning|last1=Ptak|first1=Carol|last2=Smith|first2=Chad|publisher=McGraw Hill|year=2011|isbn=978-0-07-175563-4|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;" introduced a new type of MRP called "demand driven MRP" (DDMRP).&lt;ref name="Ptak, Carol 2011"&gt;Ptak, Carol and Smith, Chad (2011). ''Orlicky's MRP 3rd edition'', McGraw Hill, New York {{ISBN|978-0-07-175563-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The new edition of the book was written, not by Orlicky himself (he died in 1986) but by Carol Ptak and Chad Smith at the invitation of [[McGraw Hill]] to update Orlicky's work.

Demand driven MRP is a multi-echelon formal planning and execution technique with five distinct components:&lt;ref name="Ptak, Carol 2011"/&gt;
# '''Strategic inventory positioning''' – The first question of effective inventory management is not, "how much inventory should we have?"  Nor is it, "when should we [[make or buy]] something?" The most fundamental question to ask in today's manufacturing environments is, "given our system and environment, where should we place inventory to have the best protection?"  Inventory is like a break wall to protect boats in a [[marina]] from the roughness of incoming waves.  Out on the open ocean the break walls have to be 50–100 feet tall, but in a small lake the break walls are only a couple feet tall.  In a glassy smooth [[pond]] no break wall is necessary.
# '''Buffer profiles and level''' – Once the strategically replenished positions are determined, the actual levels of those buffers have to be initially set.  Based on several factors, different materials and parts behave differently (but many also behave nearly the same).  DDMRP calls for the grouping of parts and materials chosen for strategic replenishment and that behave similarly into "buffer profiles."  Buffer profiles take into account important factors including [[lead time]] (relative to the environment), [[Statistical variability|variability]] (demand or supply), whether the part is made or bought or distributed and whether there are significant order multiples involved.  These buffer profiles are made up of "zones" that produce a unique buffer picture for each part as their respective individual part traits are applied to the group traits. 
# '''Dynamic adjustments''' – Over the course of time, group and individual traits can and will change as new suppliers and materials are used, new [[Market (economics)|market]]s are opened and/or old markets deteriorate and manufacturing capacities and methods change.  Dynamic buffer levels allow the company to adapt buffers to group and individual part trait changes over time through the use of several types of adjustments.  Thus, as more or less variability is encountered or as a company's strategy changes these buffers adapt and change to fit the environment.
# '''Demand-driven planning''' – takes advantage of the sheer computational power of today's hardware and software.  It also takes advantage of the new demand-driven or [[Push–pull strategy|pull]]-based approaches.  When these two elements are combined then there is the best of both worlds; relevant approaches and tools for the way the world works today ''and'' a system of routine that promotes better and quicker decisions and actions at the planning and execution level.
# '''Highly visible and collaborative execution''' – Simply launching [[purchase order]]s (POs), manufacturing orders (MOs) and transfer orders (TOs) from any planning system does not end the materials and order management challenge.  These POs, MOs and TOs have to be effectively managed to synchronize with the changes that often occur within the "execution horizon." The execution horizon is the time from which a PO, MO or TO is opened until the time it is closed in the system of record.  DDMRP defines a modern, integrated and greatly needed system of execution for all part categories in order to speed the proliferation of relevant information and priorities throughout an organization and supply chain.

These five components work together to greatly dampen, if not eliminate, the nervousness of traditional MRP systems and the [[bullwhip effect]] in complex and challenging environments. The Demand Driven Institute claims the following: In utilizing these approaches, planners will no longer have to try to respond to every single message for every single part that is off by even one day. This approach provides real information about those parts that are truly at risk of negatively impacting the planned availability of inventory. DDMRP sorts the significant few items that require attention from the many parts that are being managed. Under the DDMRP approach, fewer planners can make better decisions more quickly.  That means companies will be better able to leverage their working and human capital as well as the huge investments they have made in information technology. One down-side, however, is that DDMRP can not run on the majority of MRPII/ERP systems in use today, so organisations will have to implement a compatible system in order to run DDMRP. 

DDMRP has been successfully applied to a variety of environments including CTO ([[configure to order]]), MTS ([[make to stock]]), MTO ([[make to order]]) and ETO ([[engineer to order]]).&lt;ref name="Ptak, Carol 2011"/&gt; The methodology is applied differently in each environments but the five step process remains the same.  DDMRP leverages knowledge from [[theory of constraints]] (TOC), traditional MRP &amp; [[Distribution resource planning|DRP]], [[Six Sigma]] and [[Lean manufacturing|lean]]. It is effectively an amalgam of MRP and kanban techniques. As such, it incorporates the strengths of both but also the weaknesses of both; hence its limited adoption.

'''New Public Administration''' is an [[Antipositivism|anti-positivist]], anti-technical, and anti-hierarchical reaction against [[Public administration#History|traditional public administration]]. A practiced theory in response to the ever changing needs of the public and how institutions and administrations go about solving them. Focus is on the role of government and how they can provide these services to citizens in which are a part of public interest, by means, but not limited to public policy.

== History  ==
New Public Administration traces its origins to the first Minnowbrook Conference held in 1968 under the patronage of [[Dwight Waldo]]. This conference brought together the top scholars in public administration and management to discuss and reflect on the state of the field and its future.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, Rosemary. &amp; Slyke, David M. Van. &amp; Kim, Soonhee. The Future of Public Administration around the World: The Minnowbrook Perspective. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1960s in the USA was a time of [[1960s#Social and political movements|unusual social and political turbulence and upheaval]].  In this context, Waldo concluded that neither the study nor the practice of public administration was responding suitably to the escalating turmoil and the complications that arose from those conditions. Part of the reasoning for this Waldo argued, was the general mistrust that had become associated with public administration itself.  A call to revamp the ethical obligations of the service sector was necessary in rebuilding the public's trust of government and bureaucracy in which had been plagued by corruption and the narrow self interests of others.  Moving toward a more ethical public service, then, required attention to the underlying values that support public service-and public servants-in any sector.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Getha-Taylor|first=Heather|title=Where's (Dwight) Waldo?|journal=Public Performance &amp; Management Review|date=June 2009|volume=32|series=No. 4|pages=574–578|doi=10.2753/pmr1530-9576320406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[new public management]](npm) did not offer public servants an alternative model to help them resolve emerging conflicts and tensions. Concepts of citizenship, democracy or public interest have evolved over time and they are continuing to evolve. Consequently, the role of government and the role of the public service are being transformed in ways that push beyond the constraints of the Classic model he lenses of varying perspectives can challenge, clarify, and create a history that boasts enough depth to serve as not only a history in a traditional sense but also an interactive timeline that ignites constant improvement. At its core, public service requires a vision that extends beyond narrow self-interest.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Waldo sees public administration and bureaucracy as integrally bound to civilization and to our culture in two senses: the evolution of civilization itself was dependent upon public administration and related concepts are constitutive elements within out specific civilization and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martini|first=Frank|title=Leaders in the Field: Dwight Waldo|journal=Public Administration Review|date=1993|volume=53|series=September/October|issue=5|pages=409–418|doi=10.2307/976341|jstor=976341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New Public Administration theory deals with the following issues''':
* '''Democratic citizenship'''; Refers directly to the belief in creating a government where the "common man" has a voice in politics. For such an approach to work, citizens must become aware, knowledgeable, and active in their communities and nations. True democratic citizenship requires more than voting for representatives. It requires using one's own mind, voice, and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chilcoat,G.W.|first=&amp; Ligon J.A.|title="It is democratic citizens we are after:" The curriculum orientation of Shirley H. Engle's approach to social studies education.|journal=Submitted to the International Journal of Social Education|date=February 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Public interest'''; Refers to the collective common good within society, to which is the main objective of public     interest. 
* '''Public policy'''; The means by which new public policy is enacted, and introduced. Not limited in participation of the public but encouraged involvement.  
*'''Services to citizens'''; Providing and upholding the moral and ethical standard in regards to meeting the needs of citizens  through institutions and bureaucracies.

First, a ‘new’ theory should start with the ideal of democratic citizenship. The public service derives its true meaning from its mandate to serve citizens to advance the public good. This is the raison d’être of the institution, the source of motivation and pride of all those who choose to make it their life, whether for a season or for an entire career.

== Main Features of new public administration ==
These are:
# '''Responsiveness''': The administration should bring about certain internal as well as external changes so that public administration could be made more relevant to the social, economic, political and technological environment. For this to happen the administration has to be more flexible and adaptable to the various changes.
# '''Client Centricity''': this means that the effectiveness of the administrator should be judged not only from the point of view of the government, but from that of the citizens. If the administrative actions did not improve the quality of life of citizens then they are not effective notwithstanding whatsoever rationality and efficiency they may have.
# '''Structural Changes in Administration''': the new public administration approach calls for small, flexible and less hierarchical structures In administration so that the citizens administration interface could become more flexible and comfortable. The organizational structure should be in with the socially relevant conditions.
# '''Multi-disciplinary Nature of Public Administration''': knowledge from several disciplines and not just one dominating paradigm build the discipline of public administration. The political, social, economic, management and human relation approaches are needed to ensure the growth of discipline.
# '''[[Politics-Administration Dichotomy]]''' since administrators today are involved in policy formulation and policy implementation at all the stages. Dichotomy meaning "a division or contrast between two things that are or are represented as being opposed or entirely different".
# '''Awareness''': Bring attention to the works of a public administration and the task that public administrators carry out for the community and for the government. Jobs of public administrators affect communities and large numbers of people. The importance of the job should be highlighted.
# '''Case Studies''': Case studies help public administrators highlight situations and events where policies were not carried out as they should be. They set an example for what to do and what not to do. Case studies are a basic way to break down events in order to learn from other people’s mistakes and the affects those mistakes have had on the community. With public administration being a job devoted to the people; it is an obvious way to see the reality of the work you do in the community. While there are many cases where policies were not carried out as planned. There are also plenty of examples of executed policies that have benefited communities, and those are important to look at as well.
# '''Structure Change''': Public Administration is moving is many different directions, it is more often called Public Management now. This is because the job is moving towards a direction of not only implementing policy to people but also managing policies as it trickles down through the law process, so that it is realistic for communities and the people in them.
# '''Jack of All Trades''': the best public administrators tend to be someone who has knowledge in politics and law, but also has a hand in community functions. This allows for a smooth transition from policy to implementation.
# '''Change''': With the changes in the world, the job of public administration has changed. The job may be the same, but titles like Public Manager and Public Adviser have replaced the title Public Administrator.

== Themes ==
#'''Relevance''': Traditional public administration has too little interest in contemporary problems and issues. Social realities must be taken into consideration. i.e. people should see changes as relevant meaning thereby that changes should be specific to the needs of the area and the need of the people. Earlier approaches to NPA considered that rationality of the people was neglected. NPA suggests the inclusion of rationality of the people too in the process of policy formulation.
#'''Values''': Value-neutrality in public administration is an impossibility. The values being served through administrative action must be transparent.To practice transparency in public administration is to ensure citizens the availability of information which is deemed public. This should be an organizational goal, and is to be taken into account when conducting all public business regardless of one’s job title. If the goal of an organization is to serve the citizens to the best of their ability, then avoiding or failing to achieve transparency would cause significant damage to the relationship between them and the people they are aiming to serve.
#'''[[Social equity|Social Equity]]''': Realization of social equity should be a chief goal of public administration.
#'''Change''': Skepticism toward the deeply rooted powers invested in permanent institutions and the status quo. Operational flexibility and organisational adaptability to meet the environmental changes should be in-built in the administrative system.
#'''Client Focus''': Positive, proactive, and responsive administrators rather than inaccessible and authoritarian "[[ivory tower]]" bureaucrats.
#'''Management-Worker relations.''' There should be equal emphasis both on efficiency and humane considerations. The new approach has to satisfy both the efficiency and the human relations criterion in order to achieve success.

NPA provides solutions for achieving these goals, popularly called 4 D's i.e. Decentralisation, Debureaucratisation, Delegation and Democratisation.

== Criticism ==
Though New Public Administration brought public administration closer to political science, it was criticized as anti-theoretic and anti-management. Robert T. Golembiewski describes it as radicalism in words and status quo in skills and technologies. Further, it must be counted as only a cruel reminder of the gap in the field between aspiration and performance. Golembiewski considers it as a temporary and transitional phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Golembiewski|first=Robert|title=Public Administration as a Developing Discipline|date=1 August 1977|publisher=CRC Press|location=New York, New York|pages=118–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, we can say that the solutions for achieving the goals and anti-goals were not provided by the NPA scholars explicitly. Secondly, how much one should decentralize or delegate or debureaucratize or democratize in order to achieve the goals? On this front NPA is totally silent.

As said in ''A New Synthesis of Public Administration,'' governments have always been called upon to make difficult decisions, undertake complicated initiatives and face complex problems characteristics of the period. This is not in dispute. Nonetheless, the current circumstances is to determine what can be handled in the traditional way and what must be done differently.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/973347|jstor=973347|title=Needed: New Expertise in Public Administration|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=27|issue=4|pages=321|year=1967|last1=Banovetz|first1=James M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments have always been called upon to face difficult problems. Setting priorities and making choices have always been difficult. For example, eliminating a sizable deficit is “merely” a difficult problem, although it is hard to believe when one is in the middle of such a heart-wrenching exercise. This entails making choices among equally deserving public purposes and making tough decisions about what should be preserved for the future. It requires reconciling future needs with what could garner a sufficient degree of public support in the short term to move forward. Academic public administration has lagged considerably behind practicing public administration. Improved curricula and a refocusing of emphasis upon the policy dynamics of government administration will be important factors in enticing more students to study of public administration. It is more important to increase the number and improving the geographic spread of universities with public affairs programs, integrating public affairs components into the curricula of other graduate and professional programs, developing many more in-service, mid-career educational programs for public servants, and utilizing existing resources to strengthen public affairs programs.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The motives behind the promotion of New Public Administration is also in question in the case of [[Hong Kong]]. As [[Anthony Cheung]] argues, officials often employed the rhetoric of New Public Administration to roll back public expenditure and decrease welfare provision in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cheung | first=Anthony B. L. |date= 1996 | title=Efficiency As the Rhetoric: Public-Sector Reform in Hong Kong Explained | journal=[[International Review of Administrative Sciences]] | volume= 62 | issue=  | pages=43 | url= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governors at that time used the excuse of administrative efficiency to curtail the power of the bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Cheung | first=Anthony B. L. |date= 1992 | title=Public Sector Reform in Hong Kong: Perspectives and Problems | journal=Asian Journal of Public Administration | volume= 14 | issue=2 | pages=141 | url= | accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
[[Felix A. Nigro|Felix]] and [[Lloyd Nigro]] observe that New Public Administration has seriously jolted the traditional concepts and outlook of the discipline and enriched the subject by imparting a wider perspective by linking it closely to the society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nigro|first=Lloyd|title=New Public Personnel Administration|date=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA|isbn=1133734286|pages=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The overall focus in NPA movement seems to be to make administration to be less "generic" and more "public", less "descriptive" and more "prescriptive", less "institution-oriented" and more "client-oriented", less "neutral" and more "normative" but should be no less scientific all the same.

[[CNBC|CNBC's]] '''''On the Money''''', hosted by [[Carmen Wong Ulrich]], is a television program that focuses primarily on personal finance, a programming departure from CNBC's "investor focused" weekday programming.

The program premiered on October 10, 2005 with Dylan Ratigan as host.  Ratigan was replaced by [[Melissa Francis]] in 2007 and remained on CNBC's schedule until October 5, 2007.  On September 27, it was announced that the program would be removed from the schedule effective October 10, due in part to low ratings,&lt;ref name="cancel"&gt;[http://insidecable.blogsome.com/2007/09/27/cnbc-announces-new-primetime-schedule/#comments Inside Cable News :: CNBC announces new primetime schedule :: September :: 2007&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; but the last edition was aired on October 5.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/21030774?__source=RSS|blog|&amp;par=RSS CNBC Programming Changes for Monday, October 8th and Tuesday, October 9th - CNBC News Releases - MSNBC.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was completely revamped and relaunched on August 4, 2008 featuring new CNBC personality [[Carmen Wong Ulrich]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/id/25785354 On the Money w/ Carmen Wong Ulrich Premieres Monday, Aug. 4th&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The program is now more of a financial advice show, similar to ''[[The Suze Orman Show]]''.

''On the Money'' was reduced from a daily 10pm program, to a single Saturday night airing (at 8pm ET) effective June 1, 2009.  On August 25, 2009, CNBC announced that it would be canceling the program for the second time, shifting resources to their more successful documentary unit.

This program is not to be confused with the current program ''[[On the Money (2013 TV series)|On the Money]]'' produced by CNBC for [[broadcast syndication]]. That program was retitled as ''On the Money with [[Maria Bartiromo]]'' in January 2013 from ''The Wall Street Journal Report'' after the end of the NBC/Dow Jones partnership deal, then cut down to the first part of the title upon Bartiromo's departure from CNBC in late November 2013 for [[Fox Business Network]].

==About the program==
In its original format, ''On the Money'' wrapped up the day's news from the worlds of business and everyday life, took a closer look at the money in every story.  ''On the Money'' literally followed the money through everything from breaking news to politics, to [[popular culture|pop culture]], and even sports.

In the current format, Carmen Wong Ulrich gives financial advice and takes viewers' phone calls as well as viewers' Emails.  This format is similar to ''The Suze Orman Show'' (which airs  Saturday nights on CNBC).

==History==
''On the Money'', which originally started as a nightly business news program, premiered as "[[Hurricane Katrina]]: Crisis and Recovery" (which was hosted by [[Bill Griffeth]]) on August 29, 2005, replacing reruns of ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.  Five weeks later (October 5), the program rechristened as ''On the Money''.  [[Dylan Ratigan]], who previously hosted ''[[Bullseye (U.S. TV program)|Bullseye]]'' (which ended its run on March 11 of that year), was given the hosting duties for the latter as well.

On July 6, 2006, ''On the Money'' debuted a new look, which included the program's second logo, a new set, and new graphics. The entire graphics package was designed and redesigned in house at CNBC.  Gary Keenan and by Felix Thoo of Creative Group, a post production house in NYC created some promotional work for a prior version of the graphics.

Ratigan, who was the original host of this program since October 3, 2005, left the program in December 2006 in preparation for his nightly hosting duties on ''Fast Money'', which redebuted as a nightly series on January 8, 2007.  He was replaced on that same night by Melissa Francis.  The original version of ''On the Money'' ended its run on October 5, 2007.

''On the Money'' was completely revamped and relaunched as a personal finance program August 4, 2008 with new host [[Carmen Wong Ulrich]].  The program is now more focused on providing specific personal finance information to its audience.  Viewers can call in, text, or email Carmen with their problems, and each night, Carmen will go through them individually.  ''On The Money'' also invites a variety of "Money Experts" to join Carmen on the program and assist her in finding the solutions to her viewers' problems and concerns.

==CNBC Asia==
Until March 23, 2007, ''On the Money'' was also broadcast at 12:00pm [[Singapore]]/[[Hong Kong]]/[[Taiwan]] time on [[CNBC Asia]] (Tuesdays to Fridays).  Unlike the US (where it is first broadcast live at 7:00pm ET), the program was mostly seen on a [[broadcast delay|tape delay]]. Now CNBC Asia only broadcasts "LIVE" Friday (US time) edition of ''On the Money'' on Saturdays morning at 7am (with [[Daylight saving time|DST]])/8am (without DST) SIN/HK/TWN time.

== Production ==
''On The Money'' is [[Video recording|recorded]] at the [[Englewood Cliffs, NJ]], [[studios]] at the Global Headquarters of [[CNBC]], a national [[cable television]] [[Television network|network]] owned by [[NBC Universal]] and [[GE]].

==Background==

===Apple===
{{main|Leprechaun economics}}
A great deal of the company's [[intangible property]] was exposed around the time of an internal [[Apple Inc.]] reorganization of three [[Ireland|Irish]] subsidiaries. The company's 2015 [[gross domestic product]] showed a 26% increase, and close to $270&amp;nbsp;billion of [[intangible asset]]s suddenly appeared in Ireland as the year began – more than the entire value of all residential property in Ireland. This may indicate that Apple took advantage of a tax incentive known as a capital allowance, which gives Irish companies generous tax breaks for buying intangible property – essentially intellectual property like patents. In other words, Apple (some suggest) transferred them to a subsidiary located in Ireland for the tax incentives, and didn't have to pay any tax on the transaction in Bermuda either, on the value it declared on the property when it sold them to itself.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Following a 2013 US Senate investigation, which featured testimony by CEO [[Tim Cook]], Ireland announced that henceforth Irish companies would be required to declare [[tax residency]] somewhere in the world. Apple had been paying a lower rate of corporate taxes in Ireland in a so-called sweetheart deal. This attracted the attention of EU regulators as many multinationals were doing the same thing. As the tax break in the Netherlands came to a scheduled end, Apple's law firm, Baker McKenzie, researched island tax havens, asking Appleby officials in numerous jurisdictions to confirm "that an Irish company can conduct management activities ... without being subject to taxation in your jurisdiction." Two of the subsidiaries moved to [[Jersey]] and took intellectual property with them{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}. The third is receiving tax breaks in Ireland for buying Apple IP from another Apple subsidiary{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

The Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC) issued a Statement re Apple on 7 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jerseyfsc.org/media/1596/2017-11-07_jfsc_statement_re_apple.pdf|title=Jersey Financial Services Commission Statement re Apple|publisher=JFSC|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JFSC confirmed that the two Apple subsidiaries referred to by the media are not Jersey-registered companies and their understanding is that Apple funds relating to these entities have not been remitted to or held in the Island.

The JFSC states that it has not seen any of the documentation that the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) claims to hold following the Appleby data breach. If the ICIJ possesses data of a criminal or regulatory nature which relates to business activities in Jersey then the JFSC requested that this information is shared with them and, if there is any evidence of regulatory wrongdoing, then they would investigate and take action if appropriate.

The Government of Jersey (States of Jersey) also issued a statement of similar effect on 7 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.je/News/2017/Pages/ApplebyStatement.aspx|title=Jersey Government Appleby Data Breach Statement|publisher=States of Jersey|date=7 November 2017|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is of further note that the jurisdiction of Jersey has recently been independently assessed as fully compliant with international regulatory guidelines on tax transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/countries/jersey/global-forum-on-transparency-and-exchange-of-information-for-tax-purposes-jersey-2017-second-round-9789264283824-en.htm|title=OECD Jersey Report 2017|publisher=OECD|date=17 November 2017|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU, under the leadership of [[Jean-Claude Juncker]], threatened to sue Ireland over its tax deals, although Juncker himself had approved similar tax deals in his own country, [[Luxembourg]]. Apple paid all of its taxes in Ireland as required by that country so Ireland is appealing the EU decision. HP, Nike, Microsoft and others use the same tax arrangements in Ireland, Luxembourg and other countries,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} but Apple is frequently cited as a media example.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of public corporations by market capitalization#2017]]&lt;/ref&gt; Irish companies are required to pay taxes in Ireland, but if they convince authorities {{Which|date=February 2018}} that they are "managed and controlled" from abroad, the companies may win an exemption.

=== Avianca ===
[[Germán Efromovich]], founder of [[Synergy Group]], is linked to an offshore conglomerate used for the aerocommercial [[holding business]] with ramifications in Bermuda, Panama, and Cyprus. Efromovich used a Panamanian offshore that hid more than 20 firms located in tax havens. The conglomerate was used by Synergy Group's subsidiary [[Avianca Holdings]] in the purchase of MacAir Jet, now [[Avianca Argentina]], aircraft company owned by Macri Group, for an amount of $10&amp;nbsp;million. Allowing Avianca to make headway in the [[low-cost carrier]] business in Argentina. The Argentine government accepted this offshores as a financial [[guarantee]] to assign air routes to Avianca. The whole operation of assigning air routes is investigated by the Argentine federal justice system in a case called "Avianca" in which the [[President of Argentina]] [[Mauricio Macri]] and other officials were imputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=10 November 2017|last1=Delfino|first1=Emilia|last2=Crucianelli|first2=Sandra|last3=Fitz Patrick|first3=Mariel|last4=Brom|first4=Ricardo|last5=Jastreblansky|first5=Maia|last6=Ruiz|first6=Iván|last7=Alconada Mon|first7=Hugo|title=Paradise Papers – El entramado de más de 20 offshores detrás del desembarco de Avianca|url=http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-el-entramado-de-mas-de-20-offshores-detras-del-desembarco-de-avianca.phtml|accessdate=10 November 2017|work=[[Perfil]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110143321/http://www.perfil.com/paradisepapers/paradise-papers-el-entramado-de-mas-de-20-offshores-detras-del-desembarco-de-avianca.phtml|archivedate=10 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Kremlin-owned firm]], [[VTB Bank]], put $191&amp;nbsp;million into DST Global, an investment firm part of [[Mail.ru]] Group and founded by Russian billionaire [[Yuri Milner]], which used it to buy a large share of [[Twitter]] in 2011. A subsidiary of the Kremlin-controlled [[Gazprom]] funded an investment company that partnered with DST Global to buy shares in [[Facebook]], reaping millions when the social media giant went public in 2012. Twitter similarly went public in 2013. The US government sanctioned VTB in 2014 because of the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian military intervention in Crimea]], but DST Global had by then sold its stake in Twitter. Four days after the Facebook [[IPO]], a DST Global subsidiary sold more than 27&amp;nbsp;million shares of Facebook for approximately $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=FBTwit&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/kremlin-owned-firms-linked-major-twitter-facebook-investments-icij/|title=Kremlin-Owned Firms Linked To Major Investments In Twitter And Facebook: The Russian government quietly held a financial interest in U.S. social media|author=Spencer Woodman|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|publisher=ICIJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106011238/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/kremlin-owned-firms-linked-major-twitter-facebook-investments-icij/|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glencore ===
&lt;!-- some of this should go to the main page with an even more distilled version here. This is my best first pass at summarizing the several news stories though --&gt;
In 2009, [[Glencore]], an Anglo–Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company, loaned $45&amp;nbsp;million to Israeli billionaire [[Dan Gertler]] in exchange for his help with officials of the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in negotiations over a [[joint venture]] with state-owned [[Gécamines]] at the [[Katanga Mining|Katanga copper mine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gertler, Dan (DGI Group): Rough and Polished: Information and Analytics on Diamond and Jewellery Markets|date=3 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ben Doherty|author2=Oliver Zihlmann|publisher=Guardian|date=5 November 2017|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/the-inside-story-of-glencore-hidden-dealings-in-drc|title=The inside story of Glencore's hidden dealings in the DRC|accessdate=8 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106060148/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/the-inside-story-of-glencore-hidden-dealings-in-drc|archivedate=6 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current DRC president, [[Joseph Kabila]], the son of [[Laurent Kabila]], who sold Congolese diamond rights to Gertler, then used the proceeds to take power in a ''[[coup d'état|coup]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

One of the Katanga board members was Glencore major shareholder [[Telis Mistakidis]], a former employee whose [[stock options]] made him a billionaire in the IPO. Glencore, which had effectively taken over Katanga, agreed to vote for the joint venture. The loan document specifically provided that repayment would be owed if agreement was not reached within three months. Gertler and Glencore each have denied wrongdoing. Appleby had worked for Glencore and its founder [[Marc Rich]] on major projects in the past, even after his indictment in 1983.&lt;ref name=glencore&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Guardian|title=Revealed: Glencore's secret loan to secure DRC mining rights|author1=Ben Doherty|author2=Oliver Zihlmann|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/revealed-glencore-secret-loan-drc-mining-rights-paradise-papers|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106023739/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/05/revealed-glencore-secret-loan-drc-mining-rights-paradise-papers|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=room&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/room-of-secrets-reveals-mysteries-of-glencore/|author1=Bastian Obermayer|author2=Edouard Perrin|author3=Frederik Obermaier|author4=Oliver Zihlmann|author5=Petra Blum|author6=Will Fitzgibbon|date=5 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|title=Room Of Secrets Reveals Glencore's Mysteries: Law firm's internal files reveal oil, mineral and grain trader Glencore signed secret deals and loaned millions to a high-risk business partner.|publisher=ICIJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106000453/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/room-of-secrets-reveals-mysteries-of-glencore/|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rich was indicted in the United States on federal charges of [[tax evasion]] and making controversial oil deals with Iran during the [[Iran hostage crisis]].&lt;ref name="KingofOil"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Daniel Ammann|Ammann, Daniel]]|title=[[The King of Oil: The Secret Lives of Marc Rich]]|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York|year=2009|isbn=0-312-57074-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bill Clinton pardon controversy|controversial presidential pardon]] from [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]] on 20 January 2001, Clinton's last day in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/may/13/features.magazine37 |title=Profile: Marc Rich &amp;#124; From the Observer &amp;#124; The Observer |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |location=London |issn=0261-3077 |oclc=60623878 |accessdate=30 October 2012 |first=Mark |last=Honigsbaum |date=13 May 2001 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204000206/http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/may/13/features.magazine37 |archivedate=4 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate ICIJ project found that tax auditors in [[Burkina Faso]] accused a Glencore subsidiary of deducting from its taxes "fictitious" payments to other Glencore subsidiaries, and of selling the zinc from its mine (to another Glencore compary) in unrefined form to minimize its revenue, which it publicly said in 2015 had not recovered from a 2017 downturn. Its CEO told shareholders before this that it expected a spike in demand, which did materialize. The mine is owned by Nantou Mining SA, which is owned by Merope Inc, a Bermuda shell company set up by Appleby with directors provided by the firm. Glencore sold Merope in April 2017 but before that it was 100% owned by Glencore Finance (Bermuda) Ltd, which was, according to a document from the Paradise Papers leaks, 100% owned by Glencore Group Funding Ltd of the [[United Arab Emirates]], an entity in turn 100% owned by Swiss firm Glencore International AG, itself a wholly owned subsidiary of Glencore plc, registered in [[Jersey]].&lt;ref name=Burk&gt;{{ cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/development-dreams-stand-still-mining-money-moves-offshore/|title=Development Dreams Stand Still While Mining Money Moves Offshore|author=Will Fitzgibbon|date=8 November 2017|accessdate=12 November 2017|publisher=ICIJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171110061248/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/development-dreams-stand-still-mining-money-moves-offshore/|archivedate=10 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nike ===
Appleby documents detail how Nike boosted its after-tax profits by, among other maneuvers, transferring ownership of its Swoosh [[trademark]] to a Bermudian subsidiary, Nike International Ltd. This transfer allowed the [[subsidiary]] to charge [[royalties]] to its European headquarters in [[Hilversum]], [[Netherlands]], effectively converting taxable company [[profit (accounting)|profits]] to an account payable in tax-free Bermuda.&lt;ref name=Nike&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|title=How NikeStays One Step Ahead of the Regulators: When One Tax Loophole Closes, Another Opens|author=Simon Bowers|publisher=ICIJ|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106011937/https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/explore-politicians-paradise-papers/|archivedate=6 November 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the subsidiary was effectively run by executives at Nike's main offices in [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], Oregon – to the point where a duplicate of the Bermudian company's seal was needed – for tax purposes the subsidiary was treated as based in Bermuda. Its profits were not declared in Europe and came to light only because of a mostly unrelated case in [[US Tax Court]], where papers filed by Nike briefly mention royalties in 2010, 2011 and 2012 totaling $3.86&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=Nike /&gt; Under an arrangement with Dutch authorities, the tax break was to expire in 2014, so another reorganization transferred the intellectual property from the Bermudian company to a Dutch ''commanditaire vennootschap'' or limited partnership, Nike Innovate CV.

Dutch law treats income earned by a CV as if it had been earned by the principals, who owe no tax in the Netherlands if they do not reside there. One in six dollars of foreign [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] earned by US multinationals was earned, at least on paper, through a Dutch CV subsidiary. Companies with similar structures include [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], [[NetApp]] and [[Uber (company)|Uber]].&lt;ref name=Nike /&gt;

=== Odebrecht ===
Appleby managed 17 offshore companies for [[Odebrecht]], a Brazilian conglomerate, and at least one of them was used as a vehicle for paying bribes in the [[Operation Car Wash]].

The papers show that the [[Duchy of Lancaster]], a private estate of [[Queen Elizabeth II]], held investments in two [[offshore financial centre]]s, the [[Cayman Islands]] and [[Bermuda]]. Both are [[British Overseas Territories]] of which she is monarch, and nominally appoints governors. Britain handles foreign policy for both islands to a large extent, but Bermuda has been self-governing since 1620.

A spokesman for the Duchy said that all of their investments are audited and legitimate and that the Queen voluntarily pays taxes on income she receives from Duchy investments.&lt;ref name=beeb&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41883472|publisher=BBC|title=Paradise Papers: Queen should apologise, suggests Corbyn|date=6 November 2017|accessdate=6 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107042716/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41883472|archivedate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Appleby has taken legal action against ''[[The Guardian]]'' and the ''[[BBC]]'' and this is widely seen as an attack on [[press freedom]].

Glencore’s writ has four plaintiffs: Glencore International AG (an intermediate holding company resident in Switzerland), Glencore Investment Pty Ltd (a company incorporated in Australia), Glencore Australia Holdings Pty Ltd (a company incorporated in Australia) and Glencore Investment Holdings Australia Ltd (a company incorporated in Bermuda).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/finance/news/glencore-seeks-injunction-against-tax-commissioner-to-prevent-use-of-paradise-papers/ar-BBNRXEJ|title=Glencore seeks injunction against tax commissioner to prevent use of Paradise Papers|publisher=The Guardian|date=4 October 2018|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Registered Professional Accountant (RPA)''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[accounting]] designation granted by the Society of Professional Accountants of Canada (SPAC). The designation requires passing a set of four exams including [[Taxation]], Accounting, [[Finance]] and [[Auditing]] and a completion of University or College courses set by the Society.

Direct admission as a RPA into the society is also offered to those holding recognized accounting designations including the CMA, CGA, CA and CPA.

The RPA qualifies to act as a Canadian [[passport]] guarantor and is recognized for admission as an associate member to the [[Institute of Certified Management Accountants]] of [[Australia]]. RPAs are also eligible to write the Forensic Certified Public Accountant exam offered by the Forensic CPA Society in the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] [[United States|USA]].

The RPA designation is recognized by the Ontario Civil service, Ministry of Education and Training Ontario and Management Board of Cabinet of Ontario for [[employment]] purposes.

The RPA designation is not as well known as the CGA, CMA and CA designations in Canada due to its limited number of members. These three accounting designations are in advanced discussions to unify as [[Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada)]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taxclinic.ca/tax-tips/2013/01/05/cpa-canada&lt;/ref&gt;  However, SPAC is currently under negotiations with other small accounting associations in Canada for a possible [[merger]] that can help to increase numbers and market acceptability.

'''Roger Evernden''' (born ca. 1954) is a British enterprise architect, musician, composer, writer and speaker.

As an enterprise architect he is a consultant at the [[Cutter Consortium]], known as author of the [[Information FrameWork]], an [[enterprise architecture framework]] presented in 1996 as more generic alternative to the [[Zachman Framework]].&lt;ref&gt;Rik Maes. ''[http://imwww.fee.uva.nl/~pv/PDFdocs/99-03.pdf A generic framework for information management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911162856/http://imwww.fee.uva.nl/~pv/PDFdocs/99-03.pdf |date=2012-09-11 }}.''

As a musician and composer he is best known for his [[new-age music]] solo piano albums - "Improvation" released in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Evernden |first1=Roger |title=Improvation |url=https://play.google.com/store/music/album/Roger_Evernden_Improvation?id=Bv2jek55vlvg3gm2dxlf7gv4gya}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Journey We All Make" in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Evernden |first1=Roger |title=The Journey We All Make |url=https://play.google.com/store/music/album/Roger_Evernden_The_Journey_We_All_Make?id=Btxxm65haxv5m4x4wwhvwsi3xuu |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parsons |first1=Kathy |title=Review: The Journey We All Make |url=https://mainlypiano.com/reviews/roger-evernden-the-journey-we-all-make |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Evernden received his BA in History at the [[Lancaster University]] in 1975, and a Post-Graduate Certificate in Education at the Goldsmiths' College of the [[University of London]] in 1977.

Evernden started his career as history teacher in London in 1977. In 1980 he started working in IT as analyst and programmer, and worked his way up from consultant and application developer to enterprise architect working for companies as [[Legal &amp; General]], [[IBM]], [[Westpac Banking Corporation]], and smaller companies. From 2007 to 2011 he was Enterprise Domain Architect and later Enterprise Architect at [[Lloyds Bank]]. Since 2011 he is Senior Consultant with  Cutter Consortium's Business &amp; Enterprise Architecture practice,

== Work ==
=== Information FrameWork (IFW) ===
In the late 1980s Evernden developed [[Information FrameWork]] (IFW) to describe an enterprise architect initiative at [[Westpac]]. This was later described in an IBM Systems Journal article, published in 1996. The Westpac project - known internally as CS90, or Core Systems for the 1990s - was a prototype for using enterprise architecture to create adaptive organizations or adaptive systems. The Westpac experience was described by [[Stephan H. Haeckel]] - an American management theorist and former director of Strategic Studies at IBM’s Advanced Business Institute - who developed the idea of the sense-and-respond organization as an adaptive enterprise.

The Information FrameWork (IFW) was presented in 1996 as framework for Information management, and more generic alternative to the Zachman Framework. Evernden (1996) explained: 
:''the objectives and scope of IFW are broader than that of the original Zachman framework. IFW is described and compared with the original Zachman structure, showing the evolution, changes, and the rationale behind the changes based on experiences from within the financial services industry.''&lt;ref name="E 1996"&gt;Evernden (1996, p. 37)&lt;/ref&gt;
In his 1996 paper Evernden also showed "how the structure of IFW has been populated by industry-wide models and supported by a distinctive methodology. A detailed discussion of each of the six dimensions of the IFW architecture is presented."&lt;ref name="E 1996"/&gt;

=== Other works ===
Evernden is co-author, with Elaine Evernden, of ''Information First: Integrating Knowledge and Information Architecture for Business Advantage'', which was first published in 2003, expanding the concepts of Information FrameWork (IFW). ''Information First'' outlines an approach to [[enterprise architecture]] that uses eight factors common to all [[enterprise architecture framework]]s that can be combined to create architectural tools for managing enterprise and [[business transformation]].A 2nd edition was published in 2015 with the title: ''Enterprise Architecture - the Eight Fundamental Factors.''

In 2008, at the height of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], he spoke about how [[enterprise architecture]] could be used to weather unpredictable events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irmuk.co.uk/eac2008/speakers.htm#Evernden Weathering the Perfect Storm with Enterprise Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 he described the architectural approach to create a single integrated IT platform from two heritage banking systems following the Lloyds TSB acquisition of HBOS to form Lloyds Banking Group January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irmuk.co.uk/eac2011/day1.cfm#Day1-S6 A LEAP in the Dark: The UK's Biggest Banking Integration Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 he presented a case study at Vesta Corporation describing a combination of online training and webinars in a nine-month program to build the capabilities and confidence of their enterprise architecture team.&lt;ref&gt;[https://irmuk.co.uk/events/enterprise-architecture-conference-europe/#session-59 Mentoring an EA Team: A Case Study at Vesta Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samba Bathily''' is a [[Mali]]an [[entrepreneur]], [[philanthropist]] from [[Bamako]]. He is also [[chief executive officer]] of “Solektra International” and co-founder of [[Akon Lighting Africa]].

==Career ==
In 2014, Samba co-founded [[Akon Lighting Africa]]. This was launched with international music star Akon and Thione Niang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/frontiers/2015/05/20/singer-akon-makes-progress-with-african-solar-power-venture/|title=Singer Akon Makes Progress With African Solar Power Venture|date=2015-05-20|accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of this initiative is to bring awareness around the use of solar solutions to provide villages throughout Africa with access to clean, renewable and reliable electricity. To date, results include a series of solar developments such as the installation of street lamps and domestic and community modern renewable energy solutions in 14 countries throughout Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=17&amp;v=MFPxL-Nz7fk|title=CNBC Africa - Akon to electrify Africa|date=2015-08-19|accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also launched in 2014 was Solektra International, a company that specializes in the planning, design, construction and maintenance of solar power systems. Samba is CEO and Co-founder with Akon and Thione Niang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solektra-international.com/management-team/samba-bathily-profile/|title=Samba Bathily|date=2015|accessdate=2015-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solektra has a B2G (Business to Government) financing model that offers attractive and affordable repayment terms. Solektra International is the execution arm of Akon Lighting Africa with a goal to use local youths to implement projects while also fast tracking the social and economic development of Africa in cooperation with various international partners. Solektra International currently has a presence in 14 countries - [[Mali]], [[Senegal]], [[Niger]], [[Benin]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Burkina-Faso]], [[Guinea]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Gabon]], [[Congo-Brazzaville]], [[Nigeria]], [[Madagascar]], [[Namibia]].

Samba is soon to launch the “Solektra Solar Academy” to provide a pipeline of trained youth where they will develop skills and expertise in the field of solar energy. To be launched late 2015, this professional training institute targets future African entrepreneurs, engineers and technicians and will provide training on aspects of planning, design, construction and the maintenance of solar-powered electric systems and micro-grids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/06/03/akon-lighting-africa-to-bring-electricity-to-600-million-_n_7500156.html|title=Akon Lighting Africa's Solar Academy Hopes To Bring Electricity To 600 Million People|date=2015-03-06|accessdate=2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Short (finance).png|thumb|294px|Schematic representation of short selling in two steps. The short seller [[securities lending|borrows shares]] and immediately sells them. The short seller then expects the price to decrease, when the seller can profit by purchasing the shares to return to the lender.]]
{{Securities}}
In [[finance]], a '''short sale''' (also known as '''a short''', '''shorting''', or '''going short''') is the sale of an asset ([[security (finance)|securities]] or other [[financial instrument]]) that the seller does not own. The seller effects such a sale by borrowing the asset in order to deliver it to the buyer. Subsequently, the resulting short position is "covered" when the seller repurchases the asset in a market transaction and delivers the purchased asset to the lender to replace the quantity initially borrowed. In the event of an interim price decline, the short seller will profit, since the cost of (re)purchase will be less than the proceeds received upon the initial (short) sale. Conversely, the short [[position (finance)|position]] will result in a loss if the price of a shorted instrument rises prior to repurchase.

Potential loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited, as there is no theoretical limit to a rise in the price of the instrument. However, in practice, the short seller is required to post [[Margin (finance)|margin]] or collateral to cover losses, and inability to do so in a timely way would cause its broker or [[counterparty]] to liquidate the position. In the securities markets, the seller generally must borrow the securities to effect delivery in the short sale. In some cases, the short seller must pay a fee to borrow the securities and must additionally reimburse the lender for cash returns the lender would have received had the securities not been loaned out.

Short selling is most commonly done with instruments traded in [[Financial market|public securities, futures or currency markets]], due to the liquidity and real-time price dissemination characteristic of such markets and because the instruments defined within each class are [[Fungibility|fungible]].

In practical terms, "going short" can be considered the opposite of the conventional practice of "[[Long (finance)|going long]]", whereby an investor profits from an increase in the price of the asset. Mathematically, the return from a short position is equivalent to that of owning (being "long") a negative amount of the instrument.  (Nevertheless, one main discrepancy in the short against a long position is that the short position must exclude the dividends paid, if any.)

A short sale may have a variety of objectives.  [[speculation|Speculators]] may sell short hoping to realize a profit on an instrument that appears overvalued, just as [[long (finance)|long]] investors or speculators hope to profit from a rise in the price of an instrument that appears undervalued.  Traders or fund managers may [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] a long position or a portfolio through one or more short positions.

In contrast to a traditional merchant who sets out to "buy low, sell high", a short-seller sets out to "sell high, buy low", or even to "buy high, sell low" when this buy is in fact "on tick".

Research indicates that banning short selling is ineffective and has negative effects on markets.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr518.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://people.stern.nyu.edu/mbrenner/research/short_selling.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1704&amp;context=njilb&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.imd.org/news/upload/Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722034426/http://www.imd.org/news/upload/Report.pdf |archive-date=22 July 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci18-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless short selling is subject to criticism and periodically faces hostility from society and policymakers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nber.org/reporter/winter05/lamont.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==
{{Finance sidebar}}
The following example describes the short sale of a security. To profit from a decrease in the price of a security, a short seller can [[Securities lending|borrow the security]] and sell it expecting that it will be cheaper to repurchase in the future.  When the seller decides that the time is right (or when the lender recalls the securities), the seller buys equivalent securities and returns them to the lender.  The process relies on the fact that the securities (or the other assets being sold short) are [[Fungibility|fungible]]; the term "borrowing" is therefore used in the sense of borrowing cash, where different bank notes or coins can be returned to the lender (as opposed to borrowing a car, where the same car must be returned).

A short seller typically borrows through a [[brokerage firm|broker]], who is usually holding the securities for another [[investor]] who owns the securities; the broker himself seldom purchases the securities to lend to the short seller.&lt;ref name="langasset"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://langasset.com/ishort.htm |title=Understanding Short Selling - A Primer |publisher=Langasset.com |date= |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lender does not lose the right to sell the securities while they have been lent, as the broker usually holds a large pool of such securities for a number of investors which, as such securities are fungible, can instead be transferred to any buyer. In most market conditions there is a ready supply of securities to be borrowed, held by pension funds, mutual funds and other investors.

The act of buying back the securities that were sold short is called "covering the short" or "covering the position". A short position can be covered at any time before the securities are due to be returned. Once the position is covered, the short seller is not affected by subsequent rises or falls in the price of the securities, as he already holds the securities required to repay the lender.

Short selling refers broadly to any transaction used by an investor to profit from the decline in price of a borrowed asset or financial instrument. However some short positions, for example those undertaken by means of [[derivative (finance)|derivatives contracts]], are not technically short sales because no underlying asset is actually delivered upon the initiation of the position.  Derivatives contracts include [[Futures contract|futures]], [[option (finance)|options]], and [[swap (finance)|swaps]].&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd9hDRR1Yx4C&amp;pg=PA41 |author=Larry Harris |title=Trading and Exchange: Market Microstructure for Practitioners |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0195144708 |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Chance&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DT0nnLDMYTgC&amp;pg=PA6 |authors=Don M.

=== Worked examples ===

====Profitable trade====
Shares in ACME Inc. currently trade at $10 per [[share (finance)|share]].

# A short seller investor borrows from a lender 100 shares of ACME Inc. and immediately sells them for a total of $1,000.
# Subsequently, the price  of the shares falls to $8 per share.
# Short seller now buys 100 shares of ACME Inc. for $800.
# Short seller returns the shares to the lender, who must accept the return of the same number of shares as was lent despite the fact that the market value of the shares has decreased.
# Short seller profits from the $200 difference (minus borrowing fees) between the price at which the short seller sold the shares, which were borrowed, and the lower price at which the short seller repurchased the shares sold.

====Profitable covered trade====
Shares in ACME Inc. currently trade at $10 per [[share (finance)|share]].

# A short seller investor owns 100 shares of ACME Inc. and sells them for a total of $1,000.
# Subsequently, the price  of the shares falls to $8 per share.
# Short seller now buys 100 shares of ACME Inc. for $800, or alternatively, purchases 125 shares for $1,000.
# Short seller retains as profit the $200 difference between the price at which the short seller sold the shares owned and the lower price at which the short seller was able to repurchase the shares.

====Loss-making trade====
Shares in ACME Inc. currently trade at $10 per share.

# A short seller borrows 100 shares of ACME Inc. and immediately sells them for a total of $1,000.
# Subsequently, the price of the shares rises to $25.
# Short seller is required to return the shares, and is compelled to buy 100 shares of ACME Inc. for $2,500.
# Short seller returns the shares to the lender who accepts the return of the same number of shares as was lent.
# Short seller incurs as a loss the $1,500 difference  between the price at which he sold the shares borrowed and the higher price at which the short seller had to repurchase the shares (plus borrowing fees).

[[File:Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie spiegelretourschip Amsterdam replica.jpg|thumb|200px|Replica of an [[East Indiaman]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]]/[[United East India Company]] (VOC). The Dutch East India Company and its shareholders played a crucial role in the transformation of modern-day global financial markets, causing a number of 'innovations' to be introduced, such as [[futures contract]]s, [[stock option]]s, [[short selling]], and [[bear raid]].]]
[[File:SA 3025-De binnenplaats van de Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser.jpg|thumb|200px|Courtyard of the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] ([[:nl:Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser|Beurs van Hendrick de Keyser]] in Dutch). In 1611, the Dutch East India Company (VOC) launched the world's first official [[stock exchange]] in Amsterdam. The first documented effort of the short selling of [[Security (finance)|securities]] in financial history dates to 1609, when [[Isaac Le Maire]], a sizeable [[shareholder]] of the VOC, initiated the first recorded [[bear raid]], selling shares of the Company short in order to buy them back at a profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/rise-and-fall-of-united-east-india-2013-11 |author= Taylor, Bryan |title=The Rise and Fall of the Largest Corporation in History |publisher=[[BusinessInsider.com]] |date= 6 November 2013 |accessdate=18 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/01/29/382463501/the-spicy-history-of-short-selling-stocks |author=Kestenbaum, David |title=The Spicy History Of Short Selling Stocks |publisher=[[NPR.org]] |date=29 January 2015 |accessdate=29 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An early practice of [[financial regulation]] was the first recorded ban on short selling that was enacted by the Dutch authorities as early as 1610.]]
The practice of short selling was likely invented in 1609 by Dutch [[businessman]] [[Isaac Le Maire]], a sizeable shareholder of the [[Dutch East India Company]] ([[Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie]] or VOC in Dutch).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2008/07/25/naakt-short-gaan-een-oud-hollands-kunstje-11578528-a1091676|title=‘Naakt short gaan’, een oud-Hollands kunstje|author=|date=|website=nrc.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Stringham]] has written extensively on the development of sophisticated contracts on the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] in the seventeenth century, including short sale contracts.&lt;ref name=Stringham&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stringham|first1=Edward|title=The Extralegal Development of Securities Trading in Seventeenth Century Amsterdam|journal=Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance|date=2003|volume=43|issue=2|page=321|ssrn=1676251|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short selling can exert downward pressure on the underlying stock, driving down the price of shares of that security.  This, combined with the seemingly complex and hard-to-follow tactics of the practice, has made short selling a historical target for criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/eblj/issues/volume4/number1/Stanley.pdf|title=Moritz College of Law|work=osu.edu}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; At various times in history, governments have restricted or banned short selling.

The London banking house of [[Neal, James, Fordyce and Down]] collapsed in June 1772, precipitating a major crisis that included the collapse of almost every private bank in Scotland, and a liquidity crisis in the two major banking centres of the world, London and Amsterdam. The bank had been speculating by shorting [[East India Company]] stock on a massive scale, and apparently using customer deposits to cover losses. It was perceived{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} as having a magnifying effect in the violent downturn in the [[Tulip mania|Dutch tulip market]] in the eighteenth century.  In another well-referenced example, [[George Soros]] became notorious for "breaking the [[Bank of England]]" on [[Black Wednesday]] of 1992, when he sold short more than $10 billion worth of [[pounds sterling]].

The term "short" was in use from at least the mid-nineteenth century.  It is commonly understood that "short" is used because the short-seller is in a deficit position with his [[brokerage firm|brokerage house]].  [[Jacob Little]] was known as The Great Bear of Wall Street who began shorting stocks in the United States in 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyberpedia.com/jacoblittle.htm |title=Scripophily - PSTA - Professional Scripophily Trade Association |publisher=Encyberpedia.com |date= |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short sellers were blamed for the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].&lt;ref name="reuters-08-09-26"&gt;{{cite news

Edgar Hoover]] said he would investigate short sellers for their role in prolonging the [[Great Depression|Depression]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} A few years later, in 1949, [[Alfred Winslow Jones]] founded a fund (that was unregulated) that bought stocks while selling other stocks short, hence hedging some of the [[market risk]], and the [[hedge fund]] was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindgren |first=Hugo |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/2007/hedgefunds/30345/ |title=New York Magazine - The Creation of the Hedge Fund |publisher=Nymag.com |date=9 April 2007 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negative news, such as litigation against a company, may also entice professional traders to sell the stock short in hope of the stock price going down.

During the [[dot-com bubble]], shorting a start-up company could backfire since it could be taken over at a price higher than the price at which speculators shorted.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}  Short-sellers were forced to cover their positions at acquisition prices, while in many cases the firm often overpaid for the start-up.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

=== Naked short selling restrictions===
During the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 financial crisis]], critics argued that investors taking large short positions in struggling financial firms like [[Lehman Brothers]], [[HBOS]] and [[Morgan Stanley]] created instability in the stock market and placed additional downward pressure on prices. In response, a number of countries introduced restrictive regulations on short-selling in 2008 and 2009. [[Naked short selling]] is the practice of short-selling a tradable asset without first borrowing the security or ensuring that the security can be borrowed &amp;ndash; it was this practice that was commonly restricted.&lt;ref name=Lavinio&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h95B-V4l3w0C&amp;pg=PA3 |title=The Hedge Fund Handbook: A Definitive Guide for Analyzing and Evaluating Alternative Investments |last=Lavinio |first=Stefano |year=1999 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=442–443 |isbn=0071350306}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Madura&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIizpVxYjt0C&amp;pg=PA308 |title=Financial Markets and Institutions |last=Madura |first=Jeff |year=2009 |publisher=South-Western College Publishing |page=308 |isbn=1439038848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investors argued that it was the weakness of financial institutions, not short-selling, that drove stocks to fall.&lt;ref name=Story&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/business/08short.html |title=A Debate as a Ban on Short-Selling Ends: Did It Make Any Difference? |last=Harris |first=Larry |year= |work=The New York Times |date=7 October 2008 |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, the Securities Exchange Commission in the United States abruptly banned short sales, primarily in financial stocks, to protect companies under siege in the stock market. That ban expired several weeks later as regulators determined the ban was not stabilizing the price of stocks.&lt;ref name=Madura/&gt;&lt;ref name=Story/&gt;

Temporary short-selling bans were also introduced in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and other European countries in 2008 to minimal effect.&lt;ref name="Oakley"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/024f75ee-cca3-11dd-acbd-000077b07658.html |title=Short-selling ban has minimal effect |last=Oakley |first=David  |work=Financial Times |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia moved to ban naked short selling entirely in September 2008.&lt;ref name=Lavinio/&gt; Germany placed a ban on naked short selling of certain euro zone securities in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-05-18/germany-to-start-temporary-ban-on-naked-short-selling-of-euro-bonds-banks.html |title=Germany to Temporarily Ban Naked Short Selling, Some Swaps of Euro Bonds |last=Crawford |first=Alan  |work=Bloomberg |date=18 May 2010 |accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain, Portugal and Italy introduced short selling bans in 2011 and again in 2012.&lt;ref name=Rucinski&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/23/us-italy-consob-short-selling-idUSBRE86M0US20120723 |title=Spain, Portugal and Italy reinstate short-selling ban |authors=Tracy Rucinski and Stephen Jewkes  |work=Reuters |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, economic regulators seem inclined to restrict short selling to decrease potential downward price cascades.

== Mechanism ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
{{see also|Securities lending}}
Short selling stock consists of the following:

* The [[speculation|speculator]] instructs the broker to sell the shares and the proceeds are credited to the broker's account at the firm, on which the firm can earn interest.  Generally, the short seller does not earn interest on the short proceeds and cannot use or encumber the proceeds for another transaction.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Reserve Board.

* Upon completion of the sale, the investor typically has a limited time (for example, 3 days in the US) to borrow the shares.  If required by law, the investor first ensures that cash or equity is on deposit with his brokerage firm as collateral for the [[Margin (finance)|initial short margin requirement]].  Some short sellers, mainly firms and hedge funds, participate in the practice of [[naked short selling]], where the shorted shares are not borrowed or delivered.
* The speculator may close the position by buying back the shares (called covering).  If the price has dropped, he makes a profit.  If the stock advanced, he takes a loss.
* Finally, the speculator may return the shares to the lender or stay short indefinitely.
* At any time, the lender may call for the return of his shares, e.g., because he wants to sell them.  The borrower must buy shares on the market and return them to the lender (or he must borrow the shares from elsewhere).  When the broker completes this transaction automatically, it is called a 'buy-in'.

Short selling stock works similar to buying on [[margin (finance)|margin]], therefore also requires a [[margin account]] as well:

=== Shorting stock in the U.S. ===
To sell stocks short in the U.S., the seller must arrange for a broker-dealer to confirm that it can deliver the shorted securities. This is referred to as a ''[[Locate (finance)|locate]].''  Brokers have a variety of means to borrow stocks to facilitate locates and make good on delivery of the shorted security.

The vast majority of stocks borrowed by U.S. brokers come from loans made by the leading custody banks and fund management companies (see list below). Institutions often lend out their shares to earn extra money on their investments. These institutional loans are usually arranged by the custodian who holds the securities for the institution.  In an institutional stock loan, the borrower puts up cash collateral, typically 102% of the value of the stock.  The cash collateral is then invested by the lender, who often rebates part of the interest to the borrower. The interest that is kept by the lender is the compensation to the lender for the stock loan.

Brokerage firms can also borrow stocks from the accounts of their own customers.  Typical margin account agreements give brokerage firms the right to borrow customer shares without notifying the customer.  In general, brokerage accounts are only allowed to lend shares from accounts for which customers have ''debit balances'', meaning they have borrowed from the account. SEC Rule 15c3-3 imposes such severe restrictions on the lending of shares from cash accounts or excess margin (fully paid for) shares from margin accounts that most brokerage firms do not bother except in rare circumstances. (These restrictions include that the broker must have the express permission of the customer and provide collateral or a letter of credit.)

Most brokers allow retail customers to borrow shares to short a stock only if one of their own customers has purchased the stock on [[Margin (finance)|margin]].  Brokers go through the "locate" process outside their own firm to obtain borrowed shares from other brokers only for their large institutional customers.

Stock exchanges such as the [[NYSE]] or the [[NASDAQ]] typically report the "short interest" of a stock, which gives the number of shares that have been ''legally'' sold short as a percent of the total [[Float (finance)|float]].  Alternatively, these can also be expressed as the [[short interest ratio]], which is the number of shares ''legally'' sold short as a multiple of the average daily volume.  These can be useful tools to spot trends in stock price movements but for them to be reliable, investors must also ascertain the number of shares brought into existence by naked shorters.  Speculators are cautioned to remember that for every share that has been shorted (owned by a new owner), a 'shadow owner' exists (i.e., the original owner) who also is part of the universe of owners of that stock, i.e.,  despite having no voting rights, he has not relinquished his interest and some rights in that stock.

=== Securities lending ===
{{Main|Securities lending}}

When a security is sold, the seller is contractually obliged to deliver it to the buyer. If a seller sells a security short without owning it first, the seller must borrow the security from a third party to fulfill its obligation. Otherwise, the seller ''fails to deliver,'' the transaction does not [[settlement (finance)|settle]], and the seller may be subject to a claim from its [[counterparty]]. Certain large holders of securities, such as a [[custodian bank|custodian]] or [[investment management]] firm, often lend out these securities to gain extra income, a process known as [[securities lending]]. The lender receives a fee for this service. Similarly, retail investors can sometimes make an extra fee when their broker wants to borrow their securities. This is only possible when the investor has full [[title (property)|title]] of the security, so it cannot be used as collateral for [[margin buying]].

=== Sources of short interest data ===
Time delayed short interest data (for ''legally'' shorted shares) is available in a number of countries, including the US, the UK, Hong Kong, and Spain. The number of stocks being shorted on a global basis has increased in recent years for various structural reasons (e.g., the growth of [[130/30]] type strategies, short or bear ETFs). The data is typically delayed; for example, the NASDAQ requires its [[broker-dealer]] member firms to report data on the 15th of each month, and then publishes a compilation eight days later.&lt;ref&gt;NASDAQ. [http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/short-interest.aspx About the Short Interest Page].&lt;/ref&gt;

Some market data providers (like [[Data Explorers]] and SunGard Financial Systems&lt;ref&gt;SunGard's [http://www.sungard.com/financialsystems/products/shortsidecom.aspx ShortSide.com] discusses the product.&lt;/ref&gt;) believe that stock lending data provides a good proxy for short interest levels (excluding any naked short interest). SunGard provides daily data on short interest by tracking the proxy variables based on borrowing and lending data it collects.&lt;ref&gt;SunGard. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SunGard+Launches+Borrow+Indices%3B+First+Proxy+for+Measuring+Short...-a0123159715 SunGard Launches Borrow Indices; First Proxy for Measuring Short Interest on a Daily Basis]. Business Wire.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Short selling terms ===
'''Days to Cover (DTC)''' is a numerical term that describes the relationship between the number of shares in a given equity that has been ''legally'' short-sold and the number of days of typical trading that it would require to 'cover' all legal short positions outstanding.  For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short-sold and the average daily volume of XYZ shares traded each day is one million, it would require ten days of trading for all legal short positions to be covered (10 million / 1 million).

'''Short Interest''' is a numerical term that relates the number of shares in a given equity that have been legally shorted divided by the total shares outstanding for the company, usually expressed as a percent.  For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short sold, and the total number of shares issued by the company is one hundred million, the Short Interest is 10% (10 million / 100 million).  If however, shares are being created through naked short selling, "fails" data must be accessed to assess accurately the true level of short interest.

'''Borrow cost''' is the fee paid to a securities lender for borrowing the stock or other security. The cost of borrowing the stock is usually negligible compared to fees paid and interest accrued on the margin account - in 2002, 91% of stocks could be shorted for less than a 1% fee per annum, generally lower than interest rates earned on the margin account. However, certain stocks become "hard to borrow" as stockholders willing to lend their stock become more difficult to locate. The cost of borrowing these stocks can become significant - in February 2001, the cost to borrow (short) [[Krispy Kreme]] stock reached an annualized 55%, indicating that a short seller would need to pay the lender more than half the price of the stock over the course of the year, essentially as interest for borrowing a stock in limited supply.&lt;ref name="marketForborrowing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.Cochrane/teaching/35150_advanced_investments/davolio_borrowing_stock_JF.pdf|title=The market for borrowing stock|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has important implications for derivatives pricing and strategy, as the borrow cost itself can become a significant [[convenience yield]] for holding the stock (similar to additional [[dividend]]) - for instance, [[put-call parity]] relationships are broken and the [[Exercise (options)|early exercise]] feature of American call options on non-dividend paying stocks can become [[Exercise (options)#Exercise Considerations|rational to exercise early]], which otherwise would not be economical.&lt;ref name="hardToBorrow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/Lecture13Quant.pdf|title=Lecture 13: Hard to Borrow Securities|accessdate=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naked short selling===
{{Main|Naked short selling}}
A naked short sale occurs when a security is sold short without borrowing the security within a set time (for example, three days in the US.)  This means that the buyer of such a short is buying the short-seller's promise to deliver a share, rather than buying the share itself. The short-seller's promise is known as a hypothecated share.

When the holder of the underlying stock receives a dividend, the holder of the hypothecated share would receive an equal [[dividend]] from the short seller.

Naked shorting has been made illegal except where allowed under limited circumstances by [[market maker]]s.  It is detected by the [[Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation]] (in the US) as a "failure to deliver" or simply "fail.”  While many fails are settled in a short time, some have been allowed to linger in the system.

In the US, arranging to borrow a security before a short sale is called a ''locate''.  In 2005, to prevent widespread failure to deliver securities, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) put in place [[Regulation SHO]], intended to prevent speculators from selling some stocks short before doing a locate.  Requirements that are more stringent were put in place in September 2008, ostensibly to prevent the practice from exacerbating market declines.  The rules were made permanent in 2009.

== Fees ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
When a broker facilitates the delivery of a client's short sale, the client is charged a fee for this service, usually a standard commission similar to that of purchasing a similar security.

If the short position begins to move against the holder of the short position (i.e., the price of the security begins to rise), money is removed from the holder's cash balance and moved to their [[margin balance]].  If short shares continue to rise in price, and the holder does not have sufficient funds in the cash account to cover the position, the holder begins to borrow on margin for this purpose, thereby accruing margin interest charges.  These are computed and charged just as for any other margin debit. Therefore, only margin accounts can be used to open a short position.

When a security's [[ex-dividend date]] passes, the dividend is deducted from the shortholder's account and paid to the person from whom the stock is borrowed.

For some brokers, the short seller may not earn interest on the proceeds of the short sale or use it to reduce outstanding margin debt.  These brokers may not pass this benefit on to the retail client unless the client is very large. The interest is often split with the lender of the security.

== Dividends and voting rights ==
Where shares have been shorted and the company that issues the shares distributes a dividend, the question arises as to who receives the dividend. The new buyer of the shares, who is the ''holder of record'' and holds the shares outright, receives the dividend from the company. However, the lender, who may hold its shares in a [[margin account]] with a [[Prime brokerage|prime broker]] and is unlikely to be aware that these particular shares are being lent out for shorting, also expects to receive a dividend.  The short seller therefore pays the lender an amount equal to the dividend to compensate—though technically, as this payment does not come from the company, it is not a dividend. The short seller is therefore said to be ''short the dividend''.

A similar issue comes up with the voting rights attached to the shorted shares.  Unlike a dividend, voting rights cannot legally be synthesized and so the buyer of the shorted share, as the holder of record, controls the voting rights. The owner of a margin account from which the shares were lent agreed in advance to relinquish voting rights to shares during the period of any short sale.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

As noted earlier, victims of naked shorting sometimes report that the number of votes cast is greater than the number of shares issued by the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.com/almID/1202430726911/?slreturn=20180410051827|title=Over-voting at Taser in 2005|author=Greg LandContactAll Articles|first=|date=15 May 2009|website=|publisher=Law.com|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Markets ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}

=== Futures and options contracts ===
When trading [[futures contract]]s, being 'short' means having the legal obligation to deliver something at the expiration of the contract, although the holder of the short position may alternately buy back the contract prior to expiration instead of making delivery.  Short futures transactions are often used by producers of a commodity to fix the future price of goods they have not yet produced.  Shorting a futures contract is sometimes also used by those holding the underlying asset (i.e. those with a long position) as a temporary hedge against price declines.  Shorting futures may also be used for speculative trades, in which case the investor is looking to profit from any decline in the price of the futures contract prior to expiration.

An investor can also purchase a put option, giving that investor the right (but not the obligation) to sell the underlying asset (such as shares of stock) at a fixed price.  In the event of a market decline, the option holder may exercise these put options, obliging the counterparty to buy the underlying asset at the agreed upon (or "strike") price, which would then be higher than the current quoted spot price of the asset.

=== Currency ===
Selling short on the currency markets is different from selling short on the stock markets.  Currencies are traded in pairs, each currency being priced in terms of another.  In this way, selling short on the currency markets is identical to going long on stocks.

Novice traders or stock traders can be confused by the failure to recognize and understand this point: a [[contract]] is always long in terms of one medium and short another.

When the exchange rate has changed, the trader buys the first currency again; this time he gets more of it, and pays back the loan.  Since he got more money than he had borrowed initially, he makes money.  Of course, the reverse can also occur.

An example of this is as follows: Let us say a trader wants to trade with the [[US dollar]] and the [[Indian rupee]] currencies.  Assume that the current market rate is USD 1 to Rs.50 and the trader borrows Rs.100.  With this, he buys USD 2.  If the next day, the conversion rate becomes USD 1 to Rs.51, then the trader sells his USD 2 and gets Rs.102.  He returns Rs.100 and keeps the Rs.2 profit (minus fees).

One may also take a short position in a currency using futures or options; the preceding method is used to bet on the spot price, which is more directly analogous to selling a stock short.

== Risks ==
{{More citations needed|date=April 2009}}
'''Note: this section does not apply to currency markets.'''

Short selling is sometimes referred to as a "negative income investment strategy" because there is no potential for dividend income or interest income. Stock is held only long enough to be sold pursuant to the contract, and one's return is therefore limited to short term [[capital gain]]s, which are taxed as ordinary income. For this reason, buying shares (called "going long") has a very different [[risk]] profile from selling short.  Furthermore, a "long's" losses are limited because the price can only go down to zero, but [[Gain (accounting)|gain]]s are not, as there is no limit, in theory, on how high the price can go.  On the other hand, the short seller's possible gains are limited to the original price of the stock, which can only go down to zero, whereas the loss potential, again in theory, has no limit.  For this reason, short selling probably is most often used as a [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] strategy to manage the risks of long investments.

Many short sellers place a ''[[stop order]]'' with their stockbroker after selling a stock short—an order to the brokerage to cover the position if the price of the stock should rise to a certain level. This is to limit the loss and avoid the problem of unlimited liability described above.  In some cases, if the stock's price skyrockets, the stockbroker may decide to cover the short seller's position immediately and without his consent to guarantee that the short seller can make good on his debt of shares.

Short sellers must be aware of the potential for a [[short squeeze]].  When the price of a stock rises significantly, some people who are shorting the stock cover their positions to limit their losses (this may occur in an automated way if the short sellers had stop-loss orders in place with their brokers); others may be forced to close their position to meet a [[margin call]]; others may be forced to cover, subject to the terms under which they borrowed the stock, if the person who lent the stock wishes to sell and take a profit.  Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stock's price, which in turn may trigger additional covering.  Because of this, most short sellers restrict their activities to heavily traded stocks, and they keep an eye on the "short interest" levels of their short investments.  Short interest is defined as the total number of shares that have been ''legally'' sold short, but not covered. A short squeeze can be deliberately induced.  This can happen when large investors (such as companies or wealthy individuals) notice significant short positions, and buy many shares, with the intent of selling the position at a profit to the short sellers, who may be panicked by the initial uptick or who are forced to cover their short positions to avoid margin calls.

Another risk is that a given stock may become "hard to borrow." As defined by the SEC and based on lack of availability, a broker may charge a hard to borrow fee daily, without notice, for any day that the SEC declares a share is hard to borrow. Additionally, a broker may be required to cover a short seller's position at any time ("buy in").  The short seller receives a warning from the broker that he is "failing to deliver" stock, which leads to the buy-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arnold |first=Roger |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/862233/1/knowing-the-rules-of-the-shorting-game.html |title=Knowing the Rules of the Shorting Game |publisher=TheStreet |date=14 January 2000 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because short sellers must eventually deliver the shorted securities to their broker, and need money to buy them, there is a credit risk for the broker. The penalties for failure to deliver on a short selling contract inspired financier [[Daniel Drew]] to warn: "He who sells what isn't his'n, Must buy it back or go to pris'n." To manage its own risk, the broker requires the short seller to keep a [[margin (finance)|margin]] account, and charges interest of between 2% and 8% depending on the amounts involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.scottrade.com/online-brokerage/interest-margin-rates.html | work=ScotTrade | title=margin account rates schedule | date=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the eruption of the massive [[Securities fraud|China stock frauds]] on North American equity markets brought a related risk to light for the short seller. The efforts of research-oriented short sellers to expose these frauds eventually prompted NASDAQ, NYSE and other exchanges to impose sudden, lengthy [[trading halt]]s that froze the values of shorted stocks at artificially high values. Reportedly in some instances, brokers charged short sellers excessively large amounts of interest based on these high values as the shorts were forced to continue their borrowings at least until the halts were lifted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111904113704576383892664177456.html?ru=yahoo&amp;mod=yahoobarrons | work=Barrons | title=Even Short-Sellers Burned by Chinese Shares | date=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Short sellers tend to temper overvaluation by selling into exuberance.  Likewise, short sellers are said to provide price support by buying when negative sentiment is exacerbated after a significant price decline.  Short selling can have negative implications if it causes a premature or unjustified share price collapse when the fear of cancellation due to bankruptcy becomes contagious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwXWZzxXxfwC&amp;pg=PP7&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=0_1#PPA253,M1 |title=The Theory and Practice of Short Selling, Chapter 9, Conclusions and Implications for Investors by Frank J. Fabozzi, Editor |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Strategies ==

=== Hedging ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
{{Further|Hedge (finance)}}
Hedging often represents a means of minimizing the risk from a more complex set of transactions.
Examples of this are:
* A farmer who has just planted his wheat wants to lock in the price at which he can sell after the harvest.  He would take a short position in wheat futures.
* A [[market maker]] in [[corporate bond]]s is constantly trading bonds when clients want to buy or sell.  This can create substantial bond positions.  The largest risk is that interest rates overall move.  The trader can hedge this risk by selling government bonds short against his long positions in corporate bonds.  In this way, the risk that remains is [[credit risk]] of the corporate bonds.
* An options trader may short shares to remain [[delta neutral]] so that he is not exposed to risk from price movements in the stocks that underlie his options

=== Arbitrage ===
{{Further|Arbitrage}}
A short seller may be trying to benefit from market inefficiencies arising from the mispricing of certain products.  Examples of this are
* An arbitrageur who buys long futures contracts on a [[Treasury security|US Treasury security]], and sells short the underlying [[Treasury security|US Treasury security]].

=== Against the box ===
One variant of selling short involves a long position.  "Selling short against the box" consists of holding a long position on which the shares have already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for an equal number of shares. The term ''box'' alludes to the days when a [[safe deposit box]] was used to store (long) shares.  The purpose of this technique is to lock in paper profits on the long position without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the long position taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short financing costs), regardless of further fluctuations in the underlying share price. For example, one can ensure a profit in this way, while delaying sale until the subsequent tax year.

U.S. investors considering entering into a "short against the box" transaction should be aware of the tax consequences of this transaction.  Unless certain conditions are met, the IRS deems a "short against the box" position to be a "constructive sale" of the long position, which is a taxable event.  These conditions include a requirement that the short position be closed out within 30 days of the end of the year and that the investor must hold their long position, without entering into any hedging strategies, for a minimum of 60 days after the short position has been closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ch04.html#d0e8793 |title=United States IRS Publication 550 Investment Income and Expenses |publisher=Irs.gov |date= |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==

===United States===
The [[Securities and Exchange Act of 1934]] gave the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] the power to regulate short sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1934 |year=1934 |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first official restriction on short selling came in 1938, when the SEC adopted a rule known as the [[uptick rule]] that dictated that a short sale could only be made when the price of a particular stock was higher than the previous trade price. The uptick rule aimed to prevent short sales from causing or exacerbating market price declines.&lt;ref name=Lavinio2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pGs-GBn8-k0C&amp;pg=PA86 |title=The Hedge Fund Handbook: A Definitive Guide for Analyzing and Evaluating Alternative Investments |last=Lavinio |first=Stefano |year=1999 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=85–95 |isbn=0071350306}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, The Securities and Exchange Commission enacted [[Regulation SHO]] to target abusive naked short selling. Regulation SHO was the SEC's first update to short selling restrictions since the uptick rule in 1938.&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_FUoBlN8p_EC&amp;pg=PA122 |title=Bank Regulations |author=S.K.

The regulation contains two key components: the "locate" and the "close-out." The locate component attempts to reduce [[failure to deliver]] securities by requiring a broker possess or have arranged to possess borrowed shares. The close out component requires that a broker be able to deliver the shares that are to be shorted.&lt;ref name=Lavinio2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Young&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TM-_yRzNx3cC&amp;pg=PA178 |title=The Complete Guide to Selling Stocks Short: Everything You Need to Know Explained Simply |last=Young |first=Matthew G. |year=2010 |publisher=Atlantic Publishing Group Inc. |pages=178–179 |isbn=1601383266}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, [[initial public offering|initial public offers]] (IPOs) cannot be sold short for a month after they start trading. This mechanism is in place to ensure a degree of price stability during a company's initial trading period. However, some [[brokerage firm]]s that specialize in [[penny stock]]s (referred to colloquially as [[bucket shop (stock market)|bucket shops]]) have used the lack of short selling during this month to [[pump and dump]] thinly traded [[Initial Public Offering|IPO]]s. [[Canada]] and other countries do allow selling IPOs (including U.S. IPOs) short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pQtdJqdpzUoC&amp;pg=PA233 |title=Security Analysis with Investment and Portfolio Management |author=Mahipal Singh |publisher=Gyan Books |year=2011 |page=233 |isbn=8182055199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Securities and Exchange Commission initiated a temporary ban on short selling on 799 financial stocks from 19 September 2008 until 2 October 2008. Greater penalties for naked shorting, by mandating delivery of stocks at clearing time, were also introduced. Some state governors have been urging state pension bodies to refrain from lending stock for shorting purposes.&lt;ref&gt;

==Views of short selling==

Advocates of short selling argue that the practice is an essential part of the [[price discovery]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=281514 |title=Short Sale Constraints And Stock Returns by C.M Jones and O.A. Lamont |doi=10.2139/ssrn.281514 |date=20 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial researchers at Duke University said in a study that short interest is an indicator of poor future stock performance (the self-fulfilling aspect) and that short sellers exploit market mistakes about firms' fundamentals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.fuqua.duke.edu/seminarscalendar/Short.pdf |title=Do Short Sellers Convey Information About Changes in Fundamentals or Risk? |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such noted investors as [[Seth Klarman]] and [[Warren Buffett]] have said that short sellers help the market.  Klarman argued that short sellers are a useful counterweight to the widespread bullishness on Wall Street,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Margin of safety (book)|Margin of safety]]'' (1991), by [[Seth Klarman]].  {{ISBN|0-88730-510-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Buffett believes that short sellers are useful in uncovering fraudulent accounting and other problems at companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Casterline |first=Rick |url=http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2006/commentary06060104.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613161835/http://www.fool.com/news/commentary/2006/commentary06060104.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 June 2006 |title=2006 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Meeting Q&amp;A with Warren Buffett |publisher=Fool.com |date=1 June 2006 |accessdate=24 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Grammar is all wrong here! --&gt;Shortseller [[James Chanos]] received widespread publicity when he was an early critic of the accounting practices of [[Enron]].&lt;ref name='Times-Chanos'&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim |last=Peterson |coauthors= |authorlink= |title=Balance Sheet : The silly season isn't over yet |date=6 July 2002 |publisher= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/your-money/06iht-maccount06_ed3_.html |work=The New York Times |pages= |accessdate=9 August 2009 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531064426/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/06/your-money/06iht-maccount06_ed3_.html |archivedate=31 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chanos responds to critics of short-selling by pointing to the critical role they played in identifying problems at Enron, Boston Market and other "financial disasters" over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://finance.yahoo.com/retirement/article/108534/contrarian-investor-sees-economic-crash-in-china?mod=retire-planning Contrarian Investor Sees Economic Crash in China] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112054411/https://finance.yahoo.com/retirement/article/108534/contrarian-investor-sees-economic-crash-in-china?mod=retire-planning |date=12 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, research oriented short sellers were widely acknowledged for exposing the China stock frauds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alpert |first=Bill |url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111904113704576383892664177456.html?ru=yahoo&amp;mod=yahoobarrons |title=B.

Commentator [[Jim Cramer]] has expressed concern about short selling and started a petition calling for the reintroduction of the [[uptick rule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestreet.com/petition |title=TheStreet |publisher=TheStreet |date= |accessdate=24 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315133930/http://www.thestreet.com/petition |archivedate=15 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Books like ''Don't Blame the Shorts'' by [[Robert Sloan]] and ''Fubarnomics'' by [[Robert E. Wright]] suggest Cramer exaggerated the costs of short selling and underestimated the benefits, which may include the [[ex ante]] identification of [[asset]] [[Stock market bubble|bubble]]s.

Individual short sellers have been subject to criticism and even litigation. [[Manuel P. Asensio]], for example, engaged in a lengthy legal battle&lt;!--over what?--&gt; with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Hemispherx Biopharma.&lt;ref name='Forbes-Asensio'&gt;{{cite news | first=Brett | last=Nelson | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Short Story | date=26 November 2001 | publisher= | url =http://members.forbes.com/forbes/2001/1126/216.html | work =Forbes | pages = | accessdate = 9 August 2009 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several studies of the effectiveness of short selling bans indicate that short selling bans do not contribute to  more moderate market dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh I and Niemer N (2008) "The impact of short sales restrictions".

'''Test Aankoop''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]) or '''Test Achats''' ([[French language|French]]) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] non-profit organization which promotes [[consumer protection]]. It was founded in 1957 and publishes research in a subscription magazine.

==History==
Test Achats was founded in 1957 as the ''Association des Consommateurs'' (French) / ''Verbruikersunie'' (Dutch). In 1960 it was one of the founders of the organization now called [[Consumers International]].&lt;ref name="brobeck"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brobeck|first=Stephen|title=Encyclopedia of the consumer movement|year=1997|publisher=ABC-Clio|location=Santa Barbara, Calif. [u.a.]|pages=64–68|chapter=Belgian Consumer Movement|isbn=0874369878}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test Achats is a founding member of [[International Consumer Research &amp; Testing]].&lt;ref name="brobeck"/&gt;

In 1987 Test Achats formed partnerships with three other consumer organizations with the intention of coordination comparative product testing in each country. Those organizations are the ''Comitato Difesa Consumatori'' in Italy, the ''Organization de Consumidores y Usuarios'' in Spain, and the ''Associacao Portuguesa para a Defesa do Consumidor'' in Portugal.&lt;ref name="brobeck"/&gt;

The organization was a party to a 2011 lawsuit, ''[[Test-Achats vs Council of Ministers]]'', in which it advocated for an end to using gender as a basis for determining insurance rates.&lt;ref name="brobeck"/&gt;

'''Tsunao Okumura''' (奥村 綱雄 ''Okumura Tsunao''; 5 March 1903 - 7 November 1972) was the president of [[Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.|Nomura Securities]] between 1948 - 1959.  He was seen as the king of [[Japan]]ese [[brokerage firm|stockbroking]] in the 1950s.

As the son of a wealthy confectioner, Okumura showed little ambition from a young age.  At nineteen, he entered [[Kyoto University]] where he enjoyed the softer pleasures offered to a well-to-do college student.  His father gave him 100 yen a month spending money, at a time when twenty yen was enough to enjoy a very comfortable life-style.  Taking his classes lightly, he spent much time in [[Kyoto]]'s dance halls along with other rich young men.  Okumura left university without impressive grades and was rejected by the [[Mitsubishi Bank|Mitsubishi]], [[Mitsui]] and [[Yamaguchi Bank, Ltd.|Yamaguchi]] banks.  He succeeded in entering Nomura's research department by a personal introduction.

==Early career==
His colleagues observed that Okumura was pleasant and self-assured but lacked the hunger that characterised other Nomura executives.  He often came to work late, was despondent and left early.  Shortly after joining Nomura, his parents arranged for him to marry the eldest daughter of a wealthy Osaka landowner.  His marriage into wealth further discouraged his ambition.

In 1935, Okumura made a serious error which nearly cost him his career.  As a research analyst in marketing, Okumura published a secret book for [[investor]]s espousing the merits of purchasing overseas [[bond (finance)|bonds]].  At the time, the [[Bank of Japan]] prohibited the purchase of overseas bonds by the Japanese.  Japan needed all the money it could get to expand its military.  Bank of Japan officials found out about the brochure and consequently reprimanded the then-president of Nomura securities, [[Otogo Kataoka]].  Kataoka furiously ordered Okumura's resignation but was persuaded by other senior colleagues to simply demote Okumura instead.  Disgraced, Okumura was transferred to the registration section.  The registration section, where only women worked, involved hand numbering every security as it was bought and sold.  The only compensation for Okumura there was that the women spoiled him shamelessly.

==Comeback==

The '''United States Council for International Business''' ('''USCIB''') is an independent [[business advocacy|business]] [[advocacy group]] that was founded in 1945 to promote [[free trade]] and help represent U.S. business in the then-new [[United Nations]]. One of its primary goals is expanding [[market access]] for U.S. products and services abroad. The organization is strongly in favor of open markets and sensible regulation.

==Membership==

The USCIB has an active membership roster of over 300 multinational companies, law firms and business associations. Membership is on a company basis, and member firms may assign as many individual executives as they like to various policy-focused committees. Committees cover a variety of issues including trade and investment policy, environment and energy, information technology and Internet policy, taxation, and labor and employment.
In 2010, [[Harold McGraw III]] was elected as Chairman of the USCIB, succeeding [[William G. Parrett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uscib.org/mcgrawhill-ceo-elected-chairman-of-united-states-council-for-international-business-ud-3973/|title= McGrawHill CEO Elected Chairman of USCIB |publisher=uscib.org |date=2010-03-02 |accessdate=2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International affiliations==

The USCIB is the U.S. affiliate of the [[International Chamber of Commerce]] (ICC), the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and the International Organisation of Employers. It functions as the U.S. representative to the ICC’s multifaceted dispute resolution services, including the ICC International Court of Arbitration which is charged with settlement of international business disputes and the legal and procedural aspects of arbitration.

==Functions==

The USCIB's three function areas are policy advocacy, dispute resolution and [[ATA Carnet]] administration.

*The organization promotes business interests both to U.S. policy makers and to international groups like the [[United Nations]]. Current, stated policy priorities include advancing sustainable development, expanding international trade and investment, ensuring strong [[intellectual property]] rights and supporting information &amp; communication technology (ICT) enabled growth.
*Dispute resolution is accomplished through the USCIB's affiliation with the ICC and its dispute resolution service which includes the ICC International Court of Arbitration. The USCIB provides assistance in the nomination of arbitrators, makes referrals to parties seeking attorneys, organizes seminars and corporate roundtables, and answers questions from U.S. businesses regarding the arbitration process and other ICC dispute resolution services.
*Since 1968, when U.S. Customs assigned them the task, the USCIB has been handling the administration of international customs documents known as [[ATA Carnet]]s. In this capacity the organization issues and guarantees Carnets, which allow temporary, duty-free imports overseas for goods generally qualified for use in trade shows or as commercial samples and professional equipment. U.S. ATA Carnets can be obtained through appointed service providers as USCIB no longer issues carnets.

'''Women in Housing and Finance (WHF)''' is a membership organization of professionals in the area of [[House|housing]] and [[finance]] located in the greater metropolitan area of [[New York City]].  Founded in 1981, WHF promotes and supports the professional growth of women in housing, finance and development and provides a vehicle through which members share knowledge and experience.

==History==

WHF Founder Cynthia Lewis was living in [[Washington, DC]], working at the [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD), during the Carter years, a very heady time for women.  Many were appointed to high level jobs in the Administration. The Washington Women's Network held meetings in the Grand Ballroom of the Washington [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] and hundreds of “power women,” and some not-so-powerful, believed that a new era had begun for women. HUD had its share with Secretary Pat Harris and Assistant Secretary [[Donna Shalala]].

Lewis was invited to join a new group called ''Women in Housing and Finance'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whfdc.org/   Women In Housing and Finance, DC]&lt;/ref&gt; composed of women from government agencies, [[Capitol Hill]] staff, and local law firms.  She recently had been put in charge of a regulatory program and was able to make the contacts she needed through the group.

Late in 1979, Lewis came back to New York to work at the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]](FDIC) and she felt very isolated.  With her responsibility for enforcement of the Community Investment Act, Lewis needed to meet people in the field.  So she started to talk to women she met about the need for an “old girls’ network.”  Lewis finally realized that it never would happen unless she did something herself. So Lewis started recruiting.

Connie Gibson, from the New Jersey Mortgage Finance Agency (NJMFA), spoke at a conference Lewis attended at [[Citibank]].  Lewis asked her if she would be interested in a women’s networking group; she was.  Lewis had met Anita Miller when, as Acting Chair of the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB), she spoke at WHF Washington.  She was back in New York at the Ford Foundation and thought it would be a good idea.  Lewis also talked to Fran Levenson (Goldome Bank), Harriette Silverberg ([[Metlife]]), Kathy Wylde (Anchor Savings Bank), Lois Kleinerman (New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal (DHCR)), Beverly Wettenstein ([[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] (FHLBB)), Carla Lerman (Bergen County Housing Authority), Jean Lerman (New York City Housing Preservation and Development (HPD)), and Kay Bergin ([[Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation]]).

They all got together in Lewis’s living room in the fall of 1980.  They decided that they should each call ten women and invite them to a luncheon meeting to discuss forming a new organization.  About 50 women came, and it was clear that they were on our way.  Lewis suggested that they affiliate with WHF Washington because it was an established group.  That is how WHF got its name.  Periodically, WHF discussed changing the name, but the Board of Directors always decides that, although WHF welcomes men members, it wants to keep its original identity.

WHF began officially with a luncheon on January 16, 1981 at [[McGraw-Hill]]. Caryl Austrian, President of WHF Washington, and Anita Miller (then with the [[Ford Foundation]]) were the speakers. Beverly Wettenstein notified the media of the event.

On February 4, Cynthia Lewis and the other “founding mothers” — Kay Bergin, Jean Lerman, Harriette Silverberg, Connie Gibson, Dana Cahoon, Lois Kleinerman Bernstein, Beverly Wettenstein, Fran Levenson, and Kathy Wylde — met and formed a steering committee to draft a statement of purpose, by-laws, and membership criteria which required a “level of professionalism consistent with retaining active participation of high-level women.”

This task was completed by August. The first slate of candidates included President Cynthia Lewis, First Vice President Connie Gibson, Second Vice President Fran Levenson, Secretary Lois Bernstein, and Treasurer Mary Williams. They were elected unanimously in October, 1981, together with board members Kay Bergin, Martha Lamar, Carla Lerman, Jean Lerman, Anita Miller, Harriette Silverberg, Beverly Wettenstein, and Kathy Wylde. The members approved the By-laws and an annual budget of $5,000.

==Membership==

WHF’s membership is a diversified group of accomplished individuals drawn from all aspects of housing and finance throughout [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Connecticut]].  Members are engaged in [[architecture]], [[banking]], [[law]], [[regional development|development]], [[construction]], [[brokerage]], [[investment banking]], [[marketing]] and [[sales]], municipal [[finance]], [[accounting]], [[property management]], [[historic preservation]] and more.  Members come from the private sector, from state, local and [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]], and from [[not-for-profit]] organizations and [[community groups]].

In 1997, a core group of professionals launched a vibrant New Jersey chapter which presents programs of statewide interest. More recently, WHF added a [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]]/Connecticut chapter which has held several interesting and timely events.

Membership has changed over the years.   WHF also periodically discusses becoming more public and aggressively recruiting new members, but it seems that most members prefer keeping the group at roughly the same size.  About 20% of membership changes each year, but it remains around 160-190.  That’s manageable for meetings and or networking.

==Programs==

WHF has been a central resource for women in the housing and finance industry throughout the New York area.  Since its inception, as market cycles have come and gone, WHF has endeavored to present up to the minute information, networking opportunities and professional development for its members.

Programs are scheduled monthly during breakfast, lunch or early evening times.  Speakers and panelists include leaders in their fields as well as key public policy makers.  WHF also hosts professional development programs in small group settings.  These are scheduled to meet the needs of members.

Programs are frequently planned in conjunction with other New York City groups with similar missions, including: Women in Transportation, Women in Real Estate, Women’s City Club, the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], [[Citizens Housing and Planning Council (CHPC)]], [[MOMA]], [[Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy]] and The [[New-York Historical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nyhistory.org/web/ The New-York Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent programs have included the following:

*Affordable Housing Roundtable
*Green Buildings&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.urbangreencouncil.org/ US Green Building Council]&lt;/ref&gt;(US Green Building Council, New York)
*Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design for Neighborhood Development (LEED-ND)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrdc.org/cities/smartgrowth/leed.asp/  Natural Resources Defense Council]&lt;/ref&gt; (Natural Resources Defense Council)
*American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
*Homeowner Affordability and Stability Plan&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chpcny.org /| Citizens Housing and Planning Council]&lt;/ref&gt;(Citizens Housing and Planning Council)
*Home Delivery, Fabricating the Modern Dwelling&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.momahomedelivery.org/  The Museum of Modern Art(MOMA)]&lt;/ref&gt;(MOMA)
*Brownfield Opportunity Act&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npcr.net /| New Partners for Community Revitalization]&lt;/ref&gt;(New Partners for Community Revitalization)
*Local Effects of the Foreclosure Crisis in New York City&lt;ref&gt;[http://furmancenter.org/  Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;(Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy)

==Networking==

Supplementing regular programming, WHF sponsors a series of festive seasonal events enhancing opportunities for members to meet and get to know each other in informal social settings.  These events include a colorful autumn gathering to greet new members, a January holiday party, an adventurous behind the scenes springtime field trip that explores fascinating locales not often available to the general public and an exceptional summer dinner for WHF’s annual membership meeting to conclude the WHF year.  Honored guests and speakers have included [[Elinor Guggenheimer]], [[Alair Townsend]], [[Carol Bellamy]], [[Claire Shulman]], [[Charles Schumer]] and New York City's Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].

To further fulfill its mission to promote the professional development of its members, WHF maintains a [[job bank]] with an updated list of positions available in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.

WHF is a member of The [[New York Women's Agenda]].
