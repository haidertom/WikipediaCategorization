'''''A Captive in the Land''''' ({{lang-ru|Пленник земли|Plennik zemli}}) is a 1990 Soviet–American [[survival film|survival]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[John Berry (film director)|John Berry]] and written by Berry and Lee Gold.{{#tag:ref|''A Captive in the Land'' was Lee Gold's last film.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/a_captive_in_the_land/ "Movie info: 'A Captive in the Land'."] ''Rotten Tomatoes''.  Retrieved: December 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}} The film is based on the novel of the [[A Captive in the Land (novel)|same name]] by [[James Aldridge]] and stars [[Sam Waterston]], Aleksandr Potapov and [[Keir Giles]].&lt;ref&gt;Maltin 1994, p. 922.&lt;/ref&gt; {{TOC limit|limit=2}}

==Plot==
On an Arctic flight the crew of a RAF transport aircraft overflies a crashed aircraft. Although a survivor is spotted, the crew realizes that a rescue is not possible and rules out a landing. Rupert Royce ([[Sam Waterston]]), a U.S. meteorologist aboard the flight, volunteers to parachute to the ice with first aid supplies to treat the survivor.

Bringing supplies with him, Royce lands near the wreckage and finds Averyanov (Aleksandr Potapov), a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] navigator, the sole survivor who is injured and unable to be moved. Intending to wait until further help arrives, Royce makes repairs on the shattered aircraft, but soon realizes help is not coming, as the aircraft is far off course. The ice shifts below the wreckage, further complicating their survival.

When a blizzard strands the two men and forces them to survive on their own, they have to accept that different cultural backgrounds cannot jeopardize their survival. As supplies run low and a leaking heater nearly kills them, releasing deadly carbon monoxide into their small enclosure, Royce begins to make plans for both of them to find a way to reach civilization, the nearest settlement, 200 miles away. The isolation, ever-present wolves and dwindling supplies leaves Royce little option.

Setting out into the wilderness with an improvised sled to carry the injured airman, Averyanov urges Royce to save himself, and not to risk his own life in a vain attempt to save someone who will likely die soon anyway. Royce refuses and strives mightily to save the two "captives" of the  wild.

==Production==
''A Captive in the Land'' was filmed in an island in the [[Onega Bay]] of the [[White Sea]]: [[Kiy Island]] and the Lena Rover, involved two sessions of location shooting. Sam Waterston had to return to Russia to complete the film after Aleksandr Potapov suffered a heart attack, causing a suspension of filming.&lt;ref&gt;Budd 2001, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Champlin, Charles. [http://articles.latimes.com/1990-06-01/entertainment/ca-281_1_sam-waterston "Sam Waterston: A Labor of Love for a Versatile Everyman : Acting: The skilled performer is still waiting for his star to really shine with the studios. He's just finished work on a Soviet-American film project."] ''LA TImes'', June 1, 1990. Retrieved: December 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''A Captive in the Land'' was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1991 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;[http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/118/year/1991.html "Festival de Cannes: A Captive in the Land."] ''festival-cannes.com''. Retrieved: December 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Holden in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', noted: "Had it stuck to the stark physical realities of the situation, "A Captive in the Land," which opens today at the Angelika Film Center, could have been a gripping film. But the movie, which was completed before the crumbling of the Soviet Union, insists on lending the relationship between the American and the Russian a turgid metaphoric significance." &lt;ref&gt;Holden, Stephen. [https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0CEED81738F936A25752C0A965958260 "Review/Film; Discovering Brotherhood In the Arctic Wilderness."] ''The New York Times'', January 15, 1993. Retrieved: December 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

A later review in ''[[TV Guide]]'' has similar assessments: "The plot and theme of A CAPTIVE IN THE LAND dates back, of course, to Jack London, long a favorite author among Russians, and the entire film project is colored by the reconciliation of American and Russian. Whether as a joint production with Maxim Gorky Film Studios or as an expression of rival ideologies (in a brief argument between the characters that seem outdated and silly) 'A Captive in the Land' is oddly unexciting. Potapov's chatty and literate Russian does not mesh at all well with Waterston's laconic would-be hero, and the location scenes look like stock footage." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/movies/a-captive-in-the-land/review/129701/ "Review: 'A Captive in the Land'."] ''TV Guide''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">The '''Académie Suisse''' was an art school founded by Charles Suisse, and was located at the corner of the Quai des Orfévres and the Boulevard du Palais, in Paris. From [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] to [[Cézanne]], most major French artists frequented this place to meet colleagues or to study after the models supplied.

==Charles Suisse==
According to Monneret, Charles Suisse was a former model of [[Jacques-Louis David]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;Probably not to be mixed up with the architect [[Charles Suisse]] (1846-1906), formed at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]], and since 1897 head of the ''[http://www.mediatheque-patrimoine.culture.gouv.fr/fr/biographies/suisse_charles.html Monuments historiques] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204054639/http://www.mediatheque-patrimoine.culture.gouv.fr/fr/biographies/suisse_charles.html |date=December 4, 2008 }}''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred Lindon''' (born '''Abner Lindenbaum'''; {{circa|lk=no|1867}} – 1948) was a Polish jeweller from a poor Jewish background who became an expert on pearls. He married into the Citroën family and built an important collection of modern art that was looted by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] in occupied Paris during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He lived to see some of his paintings returned, although others were returned to his heirs after his death.

==Early life and family==
Lindon was born Abner Lindenbaum around 1867 in [[Kraków]], [[Prussia|Austria]], a region that is now in Poland. His father was Moses Lindenbaum and his mother was Caroline Weil. He married Fernande Citroën (1874&amp;ndash;1963), sister of the motor manufacturer [[André Citroën]], and they had five sons, Lucien, Maxime, Raymond, Maurice and Jacques. His grandson [[Jérôme Lindon]] (d. 2001), Raymond's son, became an important figure in French publishing.&lt;ref name=Ottawa&gt;[http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=eac07a76-c153-4284-8711-d209c68f48a0 "In 1940 Paris, there was little time to mourn the loss of art."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428135046/http://www.canada.com/story.html?id=eac07a76-c153-4284-8711-d209c68f48a0 |date=2015-04-28 }} ''[[The Ottawa Citizen]]'', 17 January 2004. canada.com Retrieved 31 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; His great grandsons are the journalist and writer [[Mathieu Lindon]], and the actor [[Vincent Lindon]].

==Career==
[[File:25 Hatton Garden.jpg|thumb|25 Hatton Garden in 2005]]
Lindenbaum worked in the jewellery business, becoming an expert in [[pearls]]. He was in partnership with Adolf Weil and Lewis Lindenbaum as a diamond merchant at 25 [[Hatton Garden]], London, and 48 [[rue La Fayette]], Paris, where they traded as Lindenbaum and Weil. The firm had been trading since at least the early 1890s. In 1901 it was the buyer of a six-row Napoleonic necklace of [[pearls]] for £20,000 at Christie's in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=NZH19010907.2.79.15 TWENTY THOUSAND POUND NECKLACE.] ''[[The New Zealand Herald]]'', Volume XXXVIII, Issue 11753, 7 September 1901, p. 2. ''Papers Past''. Retrieved 7 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; That partnership was dissolved at the end of 1911.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/28569/page/164 Partnership dissolutions] in ''[[The London Gazette]]'', 5 January 1912, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Weil and the Lindenbaums bid separately for expensive pearls in London auctions. In 1916, a Lindenbaum was the under bidder on a pearl necklace at Christie's that sold for £24,000.&lt;ref&gt;"£24,000 For a Pearl Necklace", ''[[The Times]]'', 21 June 1916, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindenbaum changed his name to Alfred Lindon during the First World War as he thought that name would be more acceptable than a German-sounding name.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6422729 ''Painting Stolen During WW II Returned to France''.] [[National Public Radio]], 2 November 2006. Retrieved 5 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He also abandoned his Polish nationality and became a British citizen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://richardjeanjacques.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/lhistoire-dune-perlede-citroen-vincent.html "L'Histoire d'une perle: De CITROËN à Vincent LINDON"], Jean-Jacques Richard, ''Bijoux et Pierres Precieuses'', 19 October 2010. Retrieved 8 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in Paris==
Provenance records suggest that Lindon began to be a serious buyer of art around the late 1920s or early 1930s.&lt;ref name=Yeide&gt;[[Nancy Yeide|Yeide, Nancy H.]] (2009) ''Beyond the Dreams of Avarice: The Hermann Goering Collection.'' Dallas: Laurel Publishing. {{ISBN|0977434915}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, his grandson Denis Lindon (Raymond's son) remembered visiting Alfred at his home in Paris (Avenue Foch&lt;ref name=fold1102&gt;[http://www.fold3.com/image/270133221/ M1944, p. 1102.] Records of the American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historical Monuments in War Areas (The Roberts Commission), 1943&amp;ndash;1946. ''fold3''. Retrieved 8 February 2015. {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;) when he would have been in his 60s or 70s: "He was a ''bon vivant'', we should call him. He liked his food. He was rather fat because he ate too much. He was also fond of music and he read, but art was really the centre of his life."&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;

But there was another side to Lindon. Denis recalled that his grandfather "was always very anxious—he was very Jewish in that respect. He was worried about the future, always pessimistic". Denis put it down to his background. "He'd had a difficult youth and had the Jewish spirit—he was always thinking that things were going to be difficult. But maybe that saved his life because if he wasn't pessimistic maybe he would've stayed in Paris and ended up in Auschwitz."&lt;ref name=Ottawa/&gt;

==Second World War==
[[File:RMS Duchess of Atholl.jpg|thumb|RMS ''Duchess of Atholl'', the ship on which the Lindons made their escape to North America]]
Lindon and his wife left Paris for London soon after the [[Battle of France|German invasion of France]] in 1940. They travelled from Liverpool to Montreal, Canada, on the [[RMS Duchess of Atholl|RMS ''Duchess of Atholl'']], departing on 17 August 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.findmypast.co.uk/record?id=tna%2fbt27%2f1556000055%2f00702 "Passenger Lists leaving UK 1890&amp;ndash;1960 Transcription"] ''findmypast''. {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The ship was sunk by a German torpedo in 1942.&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually arrived in America where they remained for the rest of the Second World War. Before leaving Paris they placed their collection of art in the care of the [[rue Cambon]]&lt;ref name=fold1102/&gt; branch of the [[Chase Manhattan Bank]], possibly because America was not then at war with Germany and they believed that their possessions would be safe in an American bank. The Chase bank was one of the few American banks that continued to trade in France after the German occupation. Presumably unknown to the Lindons, the manager of the Paris branch, [[Carlos Niedermann]], had close links with the Nazi regime.&lt;ref name="Bazyler"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bazyler, Michael J.|title=Holocaust Justice: The Battle for Restitution in America's Courts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3h6MVlpGYbYC&amp;pg=PA186|year=2003|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-9904-8|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the Nazis reached Paris in June 1940, the ''Devisenschutz-Kommando'' (Commando for the Protection of Currency), raided the Chase bank looking for currency. They found instead Lindon's paintings which they seized.&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fold3.com/image/292793575/ M1949, p. 25], Records of the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA) Section of the Preparations and Restitution Branch, OMGUS, 1945-1951.

Among the paintings taken by the Nazis was [[Édouard Vuillard]]'s ''Le Salon de Madame Aron'' (1911–12) an important ''intimisme'' work that provides an insight into middle-class life in France in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Chris/&gt; The painting was not returned to Lindon's heirs until 2006 after the [[National Gallery of Canada]] identified it as a work with an incomplete [[provenance]] and advertised its existence.&lt;ref name=Chris/&gt;&lt;ref name=looted/&gt; Alfred's son, Jacques, an art dealer, twice denied that the painting had belonged to his father before the French authorities released new information from German records taken at the time which proved that the painting had belonged to Alfred. As none of his approximately 15 descendants could afford to buy the others out, the painting was auctioned by Christie's in New York in 2006, selling for $912,000.&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chris&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/edouard-vuillard-le-salon-de-madame-aron-4807486-details.aspx?intObjectID=4807486 SALE 1722 Lot 35.] [[Christie's]].

Also taken was [[Claude Monet]]'s ''La rue Montorgueil, à Paris. Fête du 30 juin 1878'', which entered the Göring Collection via the ERR in 1941.

==Post-war==
Lindon and his wife returned to Paris after the end of the Second World War in time to see some of their paintings recovered. According to Denis Lindon, who lived with his parents and siblings at his grandfather's home after the war, the contents were intact as the [[Gestapo]] had set up office in the building. His grandfather's tapestries and 18th-century furniture were still there, and only the paintings were missing. Alfred Lindon died in 1948.&lt;ref name=Ottawa/&gt;

The '''Apollo 11 missing tapes''' were those that were recorded from [[Apollo 11]]'s [[slow-scan television]] (SSTV) telecast in its raw format on [[telemetry]] data tape at the time of the first [[moon landing]] in 1969 and subsequently lost. The data tapes were recorded as a backup in case the live television broadcasts failed for any reason.

In order to broadcast the SSTV transmission on standard television, NASA ground receiving stations performed real-time [[scan conversion]] to the [[NTSC]] television format. The moonwalk's converted video signal was broadcast live around the world on July 21, 1969 (2:56 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]). At the time, the NTSC broadcast was recorded on many [[videotape]]s and [[kinescope]] films. Many of these low-quality recordings remain intact. The SSTV signal was recorded on telemetry data tapes as a backup in the event that real-time conversion and broadcast failed. As the real-time broadcast worked, was shown and widely recorded, preservation of the backup video was not deemed a priority in the years immediately following the mission.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} In the early 1980s NASA's Landsat program was facing a severe data tape shortage and it is likely the tapes were erased and reused at this time.{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=13}}

A team of retired NASA employees and contractors tried to find the tapes in the early 2000s but was unable to do so. The search was sparked when several still photographs appeared in the late 1990s that showed the superior-looking raw SSTV transmission on ground station monitors. The research team conducted a multi-year investigation in the hopes of finding the most pristine and detailed video images of the moonwalk. If copies of the original SSTV format tapes were to be found, more modern digital technology could make a higher-quality conversion, yielding better images than those originally seen. The researchers concluded that the tapes containing the raw unprocessed Apollo 11 SSTV signal were [[Bulk eraser|erased]] and reused by NASA in the early 1980s, following standard procedure at the time.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}}{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=14}} 

Although the researchers never found the telemetry tapes they were looking for, they did discover the best visual quality NTSC videotapes as well as [[Super 8 mm film|super 8 movie film]] taken of a video monitor in Australia, showing the SSTV transmission before it was converted. These visual elements were processed in 2009, as part of a NASA approved restoration project of the first moonwalk. At a 2009 news conference in Washington, D.C., the research team released its findings regarding the tapes' disappearance. They also partially released newly enhanced footage obtained during the search. [[Lowry Digital]] completed the full moonwalk restoration project in late 2009.

[[Apollo 11]] was the spaceflight that landed the first two people on the Moon. [[Neil Armstrong]] became the first person to step onto the lunar surface on July 21, 1969, at 02:56 UTC; [[Buzz Aldrin]] joined him about 20 minutes later.

Only limited radio bandwidth was available to transmit the video signal from the lunar landings, which needed to be [[multiplexing|multiplexed]] with other communication and telemetry channels beamed from the [[Lunar Module]], back to Earth.{{sfnp|Coan|1973|pp=1–2}} Therefore, Apollo 11's moonwalk video was transmitted from the [[Apollo TV camera]] in a monochrome [[slow-scan television|SSTV]] format at 10 frames per second (fps) with 320 lines of resolution, [[progressive scan|progressively scanned]].{{sfnp|Lebar|Hoffman|1967|p=3}} These SSTV signals were received by [[radio telescopes]] at [[Parkes Observatory]], the [[Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex|Goldstone]] [[tracking station]], and [[Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station|Honeysuckle Creek]] tracking station.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2005|p=2}} The camera's video format was incompatible with existing [[NTSC]], [[PAL]], and [[SECAM]] broadcast television standards. It needed to be converted before it could be shown on broadcast television networks. This live [[scan conversion|conversion]] was crude, essentially using a video camera pointing at a high-quality 10-inch TV monitor.

===Video signal processing===
Since the camera's scan rate was much lower than the approximately 30 fps for NTSC video,{{refn|group="Note"|For the purposes of clarity and simplicity in this article, 60 fields and 30 frames per second are used. NTSC actually runs at 59.94 fields per second, and 29.97 frames per second. Two interlaced fields create one complete video frame.}} the television standard used in North America at the time, a real-time [[scan conversion]] was needed to be able to show its images on a regular TV set. NASA selected a scan converter manufactured by [[RCA]] to convert the black-and-white SSTV signals from the Apollo 7, 8, 9, and 11 missions.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=129}}

When the Apollo TV camera radioed its images, the ground stations received its raw unconverted SSTV signal and split it into two branches. One signal branch was sent unprocessed to a fourteen-track analog [[data]] [[tape recorder]] where it was recorded onto fourteen-inch diameter reels of one-inch-wide [[analog signal|analog]] [[Magnetic tape data storage|magnetic data tapes]] at {{nowrap|120 inches}} per second.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=8}} The other raw SSTV signal branch was sent to the RCA scan converter where it would be processed into an NTSC broadcast television signal.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=8}}

The RCA scan converter operated on an optical conversion principle.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=6}} The conversion process started when the signal was sent to a high-quality 10-inch video monitor where a conventional RCA TK-22 television camera—using the NTSC broadcast standard of 525 scanned lines [[interlaced video|interlaced]] at 30 fps—merely re-photographed its screen. The monitor had persistent phosphors, that acted as a primitive [[framebuffer]].{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} An analog disk recorder, based on the [[Ampex#HS-100 .26 HS-200 .22slo-mo.22 disc recorder|Ampex HS-100 model]], was used to record the first field from the camera.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} It then fed that field, and an appropriately time-delayed copy of the first field, to the NTSC Field Interlace Switch (encoder). The combined original and copied fields created the first full 525-line interlaced frame and the signal was then sent to Houston.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} The disk recorder repeated this sequence five more times, until the camera imaged the next SSTV frame.{{sfnp|Wood|2005|pp=5–6}} The converter then repeated the whole process with each new frame downloaded from space in real-time.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=6}} In this way, the RCA converter produced the extra 20 frames per second needed to produce flicker-free images to the world's television broadcasters.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=129}}

This live conversion was crude compared to early-21st-century electronic digital conversion techniques. Image degradation was unavoidable with this system as the monitor and camera's optical limitations significantly lowered the original SSTV signal's [[contrast (vision)|contrast]], [[brightness]] and [[Display resolution|resolution]]. If the scan converter's settings were incorrectly set, as they were at the Goldstone station during the first few minutes of Apollo 11's moonwalk, the negative impact on the image could be very obvious.{{sfnb|Wood|2005|pp=22–24}} When Armstrong first came down the Lunar Module's ladder, he was barely visible because the contrast and the vertical phase were not set correctly by the scan converter operator.{{sfnb|Wood|2005|pp=22–24}} The video seen on home television sets was further degraded by the very long and noisy analog transmission path.{{sfnp|Von Baldegg|2012|}} The converted signal was sent by satellite from the three receiving ground stations to Houston, Texas. Then the network [[Press pool|pool feed]] was sent by microwave relay to New York, where it was broadcast live to the United States and the world.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=130}} Because all of these links were analog, each one added additional noise and distortion to the signal.{{sfnp|Steven-Boniecki|2010|p=130}}

===NTSC broadcast tapes===
This low-quality optical conversion of the Apollo 11 moonwalk video images—made with a TV camera taking pictures of a video monitor—is what was widely recorded in real-time onto [[kinescope]] film and NTSC broadcast-quality [[Quadruplex videotape|2-inch quadruplex videotape]]. Recordings of this conversion were not lost and have long been available to the public (along with much higher quality video from later [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions). If the one inch data tapes, with the raw unprocessed Apollo 11 SSTV signals on them, were to be found, modern digital technology would allow for significantly better conversion and processing.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|MacKellar|2009|}} The quality would be similar to what a few technicians and others saw at SSTV receiving ground stations before it got converted to NTSC.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2005|}}

In 2005, an amateur [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] movie with about 15 minutes of Apollo 11 images was rediscovered. The footage had been taken by Ed von Renouard at Honeysuckle Creek tracking station during or immediately after the Apollo 11 moonwalk. The images show mainly the scan converted monitor and briefly the slow scan monitor.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2008|}} This is some of the best quality recording of brief segments of the Apollo 11 moonwalk available.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2009|}} The images are available on DVD.{{sfnp|MacKellar|2006|}}

News that these analog data tapes were missing emerged on August 5, 2006 when the printed and online versions of ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' published a story with the title ''One giant blunder for mankind: how NASA lost moon pictures''.{{sfnp|Macey|2006a|}} The missing tapes were among over 700 boxes of magnetic data tapes recorded throughout the Apollo program which have not been found.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|pp=11–12}}  On August 16, 2006 NASA announced its official search saying, "The original tapes may be at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] ... or at another location within the NASA archiving system", "NASA engineers are hopeful that when the tapes are found they can use today's digital technology to provide a version of the moonwalk that is much better quality than what we have today."{{sfnp|Macey|2006b|}} NASA also had ongoing research reasons for finding these higher resolution tapes, as the [[Constellation program]] then planned shared some similar tasks with the original Apollo program.{{sfnp|Wheeler|2006|}}

The Goddard Center's Data Evaluation Laboratory has the only known surviving piece of equipment which can read the missing tapes and was set to be closed in October 2006, causing some fear that, even if the tapes were later found, there would be no ready way to read and copy them.{{sfnp|Hansen|2006}} However, equipment that could read the tapes was maintained.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}

On November 1, 2006 [[Cosmos (magazine)|''Cosmos'' magazine]] reported that some NASA telemetry tapes from the Apollo project era had been found in a small marine science laboratory within the main physics building at [[Curtin University]] in [[Perth|Perth, Western Australia]]. One of these tapes was sent to NASA for analysis.{{sfnp| Amalfi |2006|}} It carried no video but did show that if any of the tapes are ever found, data could likely be read from them.{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=6}}

== NASA news conference ==
NASA held a news conference at the [[Newseum]], in Washington, D.C. regarding the missing tapes on July 16, 2009 – the 40th anniversary of Apollo 11's launch from Cape Kennedy.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} The multinational research team looking into the missing tapes – mostly retired engineers who had worked on the original broadcast in 1969 — was represented at the event by Richard Nafzger from the Goddard Space Flight Center, and Stanley Lebar, the former lead engineer at Westinghouse that developed the Apollo Lunar Camera and the Apollo Color Camera.{{sfnp|Von Baldegg|2012|}} They concluded that the data tapes – with the SSTV signal – were shipped from Australia to Goddard and then routinely erased and reused a few years later.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} Australian backup tapes were also erased after Goddard received the reels,{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} following the procedures established by NASA.{{sfnp|Sarkissian|2006|p=14}} The SSTV signal was recorded on telemetry data tapes mostly as a backup in case the real-time conversion and broadcast around the world failed. Since the real-time broadcast conversion worked, and was widely recorded on both videotape and [[kinescope|film]], the backup video was not deemed important at the time.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} In the early 1980s, NASA's Landsat program was facing a severe data tape shortage and it is likely that during this period the tapes were erased and reused.{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=13}}

There was also documentation that the Apollo 11 moonwalk SSTV was recorded at the Parkes, Australia facility on modified Ampex 2-inch helical scan VTRs.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=14}} The VTRs were modified by Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Labs to record 320-line slow-scan video directly to the videotape without converting it.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}{{sfnp|Nafzger|2009|p=13}}  It was confirmed that these tapes were shipped to Johns Hopkins University, but could not be found by the search team.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}}

Nafzger stated that they did find several post-conversion copies of the broadcast that were higher quality than what was previously seen by the public.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} Their findings included: a videotape recorded in Sydney after the conversion but before the satellite transmission around the world; videotape from [[CBS News]] archives (direct from NASA, without commentary); and kinescopes at [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]].{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} At the news conference, it was mentioned that Lowry Digital would complete enhancing and restoring the tapes.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} Mike Inchalik, president of Lowry Digital, mentioned that they would only restore the video and not remove defects (such as reflections that looked like flag poles) that their software could remove.{{sfnp|O'Neil|2009c|}} A few short clips were shown at the news conference, showing their improved quality.{{sfnp|Perlman|2009|}} NASA released some partially restored samples on their website after the news conference.{{sfnp|Jacobs|Hess|2009|}} The full restoration of the footage, about three hours long, was completed in December 2009.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Some other footage from Australian ground station feeds showing SSTV video of Armstrong's descent and first steps surfaced through John Sarkissian's efforts.{{sfnp|SPACE.com Staff|2010|}} Highlights of this fully enhanced video were shown to the public for the first time at the Australian Geographic Society Awards on October 6, 2010, where [[Buzz Aldrin]] was the guest of honor.{{sfnp|Barry|2010|}}{{sfnp|AG Staff|2010|}}

'''''Art Collector''''' (formerly ''Australian Art Collector'') is a quarterly art magazine. It primarily covers Australian contemporary and Indigenous art and also features New Zealand and international artists.

==Publication==
The magazine is best known for its annual feature ''50 of Australia's Most Collectable Artists'', which is referenced by other sources and collectors.&lt;ref name="Cockington"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/investment/light-on-life/2006/10/23/1161455662681.html?page=2|title=Light on life|last=Cockington|first=James|date=25 October 2006|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crawford"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/13/1071125711091.html?from=storyrhs|title=Melbourne artists: the work to collect|last=Crawford|first=Ashley|date=14 December 2003|work=The Age|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a decade the list was compiled by a panel of industry experts, but since 2009 the list has been voted on by magazine subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artcollector.net.au/Issue47 Issue 47, Jan-Mar 2009, Art Collector magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Art collectors featured in the magazine have included Simon Mordant, Corbett &amp; Yueji Lyon (Lyon Housemuseum), John Kaldor and Colin &amp; Elizabeth Laverty.

==History==
''Art Collector'' was launched in 1997 in Sydney, Australia. Shortly after its foundation the magazine was briefly in the news when text from one of its articles was used without acknowledgement by art critic [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]], when writing for ''Time'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/35722236.html?dids=35722236:35722236&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+06%2C+1998&amp;author=Mark+Jurkowitz%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe&amp;desc=Critic+Hughes+admits+taking+writer's+words&amp;pqatl=google|title=Critic Hughes admits taking writer's words|author=Mark Jurkowitz|date=6 November 1998|work=Boston Globe| accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ''Art Collector'' published its first ''Guide to Indigenous Art Centres''. In the same year it also published the ''Guide to Public &amp; Regional Galleries'' and the ''Collector's Guidebook'', a directory of services for art collectors.

In 2012, ''Art Collector'' published the third edition of the ''Guide to Indigenous Art Centres'', which featured stories on ethically sourcing Indigenous art and how to be certain of provenance. The fourth edition of the guide would be released in late 2013.

'''Ikegobo''', the [[Edo language|Edo]] term for "altars to the Hand," are a type of cylindrical sculpture from the [[Benin Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oba with Animals, Altar to the Hand (Ikegobo) of Ezomo Ehenua [Nigeria; Edo peoples, court of Benin] (1991.17.113,1996.11)|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1991.17.113,1996.11|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used as a cultural marker of an individual's accomplishments, Ikegobo are dedicated to the hand, from which the people of Benin considered the will for wealth and success to originate. These commemorative objects are made of wood or brass with figures carved in relief around their sides.

Ikegobo, like the royal [[Benin ancestral altars|ancestral altars]], are settings for spectacular examples of [[Benin art]].

==The cult of the Hand in Nigeria==
The cult of the Hand is based on the belief that a man's right hand or arm embodies his capacity for accomplishment.&lt;ref name=Vogel /&gt; The cult focuses on a man's skill with tools, his economic effectiveness, and his ability to win physical contests. The Hand will also protect him and his household from attacks by malevolent spirits or human enemies.&lt;ref name=Vogel&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Susan|title=Gods of Fortune: The Cult of the Hand in Nigeria|year=1974|publisher=Museum of Primitive Art|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Benin culture, the hand is worshiped primarily by those who have already achieved outstanding success or wealth.&lt;ref name=Ezra /&gt; 

The Benin kings and chiefs have worshiped the hand since the time of [[Oba Ewuare]], the fifteenth-century warrior king.&lt;ref name="Egharevba 1949"&gt;{{cite book|last=Egharevba|first=Jacob|title=Benin Law and Custom|year=1949|location=Port Harcourt, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wars of expansion that Ewuare waged and won not only gave him the impetus to become a devotee of the hand, but may have also exposed him to other areas of southern [[Nigeria]] where hand worship was practiced.&lt;ref name=Dean&gt;{{cite book|last=Dean|first=Carolyn|title=The Art of Power, The Power of Art: Studies in Benin Iconography|year=1983|publisher=University of California Press|location=Los Angeles|page=33-40|authorlink=The Individual and the Ancestral: Ikegobo and Ukurhe|editor=Paula Ben-Amos and Arnold Rubin}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Design and materials==
Wooden altars to the hand are owned by Benin chiefs. The [[Oba (ruler)|Oba]], queen mother, and certain other privileged chiefs have the right to own cast brass ''ikegobo''.&lt;ref name=Ezra&gt;{{cite book|last=Ezra|first=Kate|title=Royal art of Benin : the Perls collection in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1992|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=0870996320}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cylindrical form refers to a type of round, legless stool commonly used by the Edo in the past.&lt;ref name=Dean /&gt; The altar is places on an altar stand, a semicircular platform whose straight edge is extended at both sides, which is carved on its top and sides with figures and other motifs in relief. A wooden spoke at the top of the altar supports an ivory tusk. 

Altars were places in the second public room of the house of traditional chiefs, on top of a polished and whitened mud platform.

[[File:Libros 2013 001.jpg|thumb|Cluttered bookshelf, one symptom of bibliomania]]
'''Bibliomania''' can be a symptom of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] which involves the [[Book collecting|collecting]] or even [[Compulsive hoarding|hoarding]] of [[book]]s to the point where social relations or health are damaged.

Bibliomania is not to be confused with [[bibliophilia]], which is the usual love of books and is not considered a clinical psychological disorder.

==Description==
One of several unusual behaviors associated with books, bibliomania is characterized by the collecting of books which have no use to the collector nor any great intrinsic value to a genuine book collector. The purchase of multiple copies of the same book and edition and the accumulation of books beyond possible capacity of use or enjoyment are frequent symptoms of bibliomania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-excess/201309/hooked-and-booked|title=Hooked and Booked|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bibliomania is not a psychological disorder recognized by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in its DSM-IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inlifehealthcare.com/2015/09/09/a-detailed-study-about-bibliomania/|title=A Detailed Study About Bibliomania|last=Agrawal|first=Mukta|date=2015-09-09|website=InlifeHealthCare|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by [[John Ferriar]] (1761–1815), a physician at the Manchester Royal Infirmary.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Joshua. ''The man who made lists: love, death, madness, and the creation of [[Roget's Thesaurus]]'', Penguin Group, USA, 2008, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferriar coined the term in 1809 in a poem he dedicated to his bibliomanic friend, [[Richard Heber]] (1773–1833).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferriar|first=John|title=The Bibliomania, An Epistle to Richard Heber, Esq.|year=1809|publisher=T. Cadell and W. Davies, in the Strand; J. Haddock, Warrington|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=1TcQz5ckEjUC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=The+Bibliomania:+An+Epistle+to+Richard+Heber&amp;ots=_v8s1F-1sn&amp;sig=NWFjbept8w3GKdrW--nJW6mPon0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early nineteenth century, "bibliomania" was used in popular discourse (such as in periodical essays and poems) to describe obsessive book collectors.

In 1809, the Reverend [[Thomas Frognall Dibdin]] published ''Bibliomania; or Book Madness'', a work described by literary critic Philip Connell as "a series of bizarre rambling dialogues which together comprised a kind of dramatized mock pathology, lavishly illustrated and, in the second edition, embellished with extensive footnotes on bibliography and the history of book collecting." The "symptoms" displayed by the biblomaniacs in Dibdin's work include "an obsession with uncut copies, fine paper or [[vellum]] pages, unique copies, [[first edition]]s, [[blackletter]] books, illustrated copies, association copies, and condemned or suppressed works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connell|first=Philip|title=Bibliomania: Book Collecting, Cultural Politics, and the Rise of Literary Heritage in Romantic Britain|journal=Representations|date=Summer 2000|volume=71|pages=24–47|doi=10.1525/rep.2000.71.1.01p00764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth century, book collections and collectors of note were given regular coverage as curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Holbrook Jackson]] was to follow the work of Ferriar and Dibdin later in the work ''The Anatomy of Bibliomania''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Jackson, Halbrook | title=The Anatomy of bibliomania | publication-date=1930 | publisher=The Soncino Press | edition=1st | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/8604238 | accessdate=18 November 2017 }}, also {{Citation | author1=Jackson, Holbrook | title=The anatomy of bibliomania | publication-date=1932 | publisher=Soncino Press | edition=3rd ed., rev | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/8604238 | accessdate=18 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==People with bibliomania==

==Depictions in fiction==
*Peter Kien, the protagonist in [[Auto-da-Fé (novel)|''Auto-da-Fé'']] by [[Elias Canetti]].  Kien's obsession with his personal library leads to the destruction of his marriage, his happiness, and ultimately the library itself.
*[[Yomiko Readman]], the protagonist in ''[[Read or Die]]'', is an introverted bibliomaniac, often preferring the company of books over people.
* [[Don Vincente]], a fictional Spanish monk who was suspected of stealing books from his monastery, and later murdered nine people so he could steal their books.

'''Canadian Impressionism''' is a subclass of [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] art influenced from French Impressionism. [[Guy Wildenstein]] of the [[Wildenstein Institute]] in Paris states in the foreword of A.K. Prakash's ''Impressionism in Canada: A Journey of Rediscovery'' that Canadian impressionism is "the Canadian artists who gleaned much from the French but, in their improvisations, managed to transmute what they learned into an art reflecting the aesthetic concerns of their compatriots and the times in which they lived and worked".&lt;ref&gt;Prakash. 2015. p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt; The early Canadian Impressionist painters belong into the "Group of who?" as coined by James Adams of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/group-of-who-a-new-book-paints-the-fullest-picture-yet-of-canadas-vision-of-impressionism/article21967828/|title=Group of who?

== History ==
Canada's first affair with Impressionism occurred in 1892 in Montreal at W. Scott &amp; Sons' premises.

'''Charles Bargue''' (c. 1826/1827 – April 6, 1883) was a [[France|French]] painter and lithographer noted for devising an influential drawing course.

==Life and career==
[[Image:Bargue The Chess Game.jpg|thumb|''The Chess Game'', by Charles Bargue]]
He is mostly remembered for his ''Cours de dessin'', one of the most influential classical drawing courses conceived in collaboration with [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. The course, published between 1866 and 1871 by [[Goupil &amp; Cie]], comprised 197 [[lithograph]]s printed as individual sheets, was to guide students from plaster casts to the study of great master drawings and finally to drawing from the living model. The Charles Bargue Drawing Course is used by many academies and ateliers which focus of [[classical realism]]. Among the artists whose work is based on the study of Bargue's plate work are Pablo Picasso&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Glueck|first1=Grace|title=In the Days When Artists Were Taught How to Draw|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/26/books/art-review-in-the-days-when-artists-were-taught-how-to-draw.html|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Vincent van Gogh]], who copied the complete set in 1880/1881, and (at least a part of it) again in 1890.

Bargue was a student of Jean-Léon Gérôme.  Bargue worked closely with Gérôme and was influenced by his style, which included Orientalist scenes and historical genre.  Bargue's last painting was completed by Gérôme and is now conserved in the Malden Public Library, [[Malden, Massachusetts]], USA. He travelled extensively through North Africa, and the Balkans, during which time he executed many portraits of local people with meticulous detail.

[[File:ALEX NILSON.jpg|thumb|upright|A DJ performing at an event using [[phonograph|record turntables]] and a [[DJ mixer]], a small [[audio console|mixer]] used to transition between songs.]]

A '''disc jockey''', often abbreviated as '''DJ''', is a person who plays existing recorded [[music]] for a live audience. Most common types of DJs include [[Radio personality|radio DJ]], club DJ who performs  at a [[nightclub]] or [[music festival]] and [[turntablism|turntablist]] who uses record players, usually [[turntable]]s, to manipulate sounds on [[phonograph record]]s. Originally, the disc in disc jockey referred to [[gramophone record]]s, but now DJ is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[Compact disc|CDs]] or [[digital audio file]]s on a [[CDJ]] or [[laptop]]. The title DJ is commonly used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted [[pseudonym]]s or [[stage name]]s.

DJs use audio equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and [[audio mixing|mix them together]] to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. Often, this involves [[beatmatching|aligning the beats]] of the music sources so their rhythms do not clash when played together or to enable a smooth transition from one song to another. DJs often use specialized [[DJ mixer]]s, small [[Audio console|audio mixers]] with [[crossfader]] and [[Cue (audio)|cue]] functions to blend or transition from one song to another. Mixers are also used to pre-listen to sources of recorded music in [[headphones]] and adjust upcoming tracks to mix with currently playing music. DJ software can be used with a [[DJ controller]] device to mix audio files on a computer instead of a console mixer. DJs may also use a [[microphone]] to speak to the audience; [[effects unit]]s such as [[reverb]] to create sound effects and [[electronic musical instrument]]s such as [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.

==Description==
Originally, the "disc" in "disc jockey" referred to [[gramophone record]]s, but now "DJ" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any source, including [[vinyl records]], [[compact cassette|cassettes]], [[CD]]s, or [[digital audio file]]s stored on [[USB flash drive|USB stick]] or [[laptop]]. DJs typically perform for a live audience in a [[nightclub]] or dance club or a TV, radio broadcast audience, or in the 2010s, an [[online radio]] audience. DJs also create mixes, remixes and tracks that are recorded for later sale and distribution. In [[hip hop music]], DJs may create beats, using percussion [[Break (music)|break]]s, [[bassline]]s and other musical content [[sampling (music)|sampled]] from pre-existing records. In hip hop, rappers and MCs use these beats to [[rapping|rap]] over.

DJs use equipment that can play at least two sources of recorded music simultaneously and [[audio mixing|mix them together]]. This allows the DJ to create seamless transitions between recordings and develop unique mixes of songs. Often, this involves [[beatmatching|aligning the beats]] of the music sources so their rhythms do not clash when they are played together, either so two records can be played at the same time, or to enable the DJ to make a smooth transition from one song to another. An important tool for DJs is the specialized [[DJ mixer]], a small [[audio console|audio mixer]] with a [[crossfader]]  and [[Cue (audio)|cue]] functions. The crossfader enables the DJ to blend or transition from one song to another. The cue knobs or switches allow the DJ to listen to a source of recorded music in [[headphones]] before playing it for the live club or broadcast audience. Previewing the music in headphones helps the DJ pick the next track they want to play, [[cue (audio)|cue up]] the track to the desired starting location, and align the two tracks' beats in traditional situations where auto sync technology is not being used. This process ensures that the selected song will mix well with the currently playing music. DJs may also use a [[microphone]] to speak to the audience; [[effects unit]]s such as [[reverb]] to create sound effects; and [[electronic musical instrument]]s such as [[drum machine]]s and [[synthesizer]]s.

The title "DJ" is also commonly used by DJs in front of their real names or adopted [[pseudonym]]s or [[stage name]]s as a title to denote their profession (e.g., [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[DJ Q-bert]], [[DJ Shadow]] and [[DJ Yoda]]). Some DJs focus on creating a good mix of songs for the club dancers or radio audience. Other DJs use [[turntablism]] techniques such as "[[scratching]]", in which the DJ or [[turntablist]] manipulates the [[phonograph|record player turntable]] to create new rhythms and sounds. DJs need to have a mixture of artistic and technical skills for their profession, because they have to understand both the creative aspects of making new musical beats and tracks, and the technical aspects of using [[audio console]]s, professional audio equipment, and, in the 2010s, [[Digital Audio Workstation]]s and other computerized music gear. In many types of DJing, including club DJing and radio/TV DJing, a DJ also has to have [[charisma]] and develop a good rapport with the audience. Professional DJs often specialize in a specific genre of music, such as [[house music]] or [[hip hop music]]. DJs typically have an extensive knowledge about the music they specialize in. Many DJs are avid music collectors of vintage, rare or obscure tracks and records.

==Types==

===Radio DJs===
{{Main|Radio personality}}

Radio DJs or [[radio personality|radio personalities]] introduce and play music that is broadcast on [[AM broadcasting|AM]], [[FM broadcasting|FM]], [[Digital radio|digital]] or [[Internet radio]] stations.

===Club DJs===

[[File:20021101 TRANSPLANT 10 - TALPA live - unedited.webm|thumb|right|A DJ at a techno party in 2002 in Serbia]]
Club DJs, commonly referred as DJs in general, play music at musical events, such as parties at [[Nightclub|music venues]] or [[bar]]s, [[music festival]]s, corporate and private events. Typically, club DJs mix music recordings from two or more sources using different mixing techniques in order to produce non-stopping flow of music. One key technique used for seamlessly transitioning from one song to another is [[beatmatching]]. A DJ who mostly plays and mixes one specific music genre is often given the title of that genre; for example, a DJ who plays hip hop music is called a hip hop DJ, a DJ who plays house music is a house DJ, a DJ who plays techno is called a techno DJ, and so on. The quality of a DJ performance (often called a DJ mix or DJ set) consists of two main features: technical skills, or how well can DJ operate the equipment and produce smooth transitions between two or more recordings and a playlist, or ability of a DJ to select most suitable recordings also known as "reading the crowd".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.digitaldjtips.com/2011/12/how-to-read-a-crowd-and-what-happens-if-you-dont/ How To Read A Crowd (And What Happens If You Don’t)], ''Digital DJ Tips'', 3 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turntablists===
{{Main|Turntablism}}

Turntablists, also called battle DJs, use [[Phonograph|turntables]] and [[DJ mixer]] to manipulate recorded sounds in order to produce new music.  In essence, they use DJ equipment as a musical instrument. The most known turntablist technique is [[scratching]]. Turntablists often participate in DJ contests like [[DMC World DJ Championships]] and Red Bull 3Style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redbullthre3style.com/ Red Bull 3Style]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equipment==

[[File:Spooky.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[DJ Spooky]] at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 2003, using two [[Technics SL-1200]] turntables and a DJ mixer]]
As music technology has progressed, DJs have adopted different types of equipment to play and mix music, all of which are still commonly used. Traditionally, DJs used two [[turntable]]s plugged into a [[DJ mixer]] to mix music on vinyl records. As [[compact disc]]s became popular media for publishing music, specialized high quality CD players known as [[CDJ]]s were developed for DJs. CDJs can take the place of turntables or be used together with turntables. Many CDJs can now play digital music files from [[USB flash drive]]s or [[Secure Digital|SD cards]] in addition to CDs. With the spread of portable [[laptop]], [[tablet computer|tablet]], and [[smartphone]] computers, DJs began using software together with specialized [[sound card]]s and [[DJ controller]] hardware. DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer or be used instead of a hardware mixer.

===Turntables===
{{Main|Turntablism}}
[[Turntable]]s allow DJs to play vinyl records. By adjusting the playback speed of the turntable, either by adjusting the speed knob, or by manipulating the platter (e.g., by slowing down the platter by putting a finger gently along the side), DJs can match the [[tempo]]s of different records so their rhythms can be played together at the same time without clashing or make a smooth, seamless transition from one song to another. This technique is known as [[beatmatching]]. DJs typically replace the rubber mat on turntables that keeps the record moving in sync with the turntable with a [[slipmat]] that facilitates manipulating the playback of the record by hand. With the slipmat, the DJ can stop or slow down the record while the turntable is still spinning. [[Direct-drive turntable]]s are the type preferred by DJs, with the [[Technics SL-1200]] being the most popular model of turntables for DJs. Belt-drive turntables are less expensive, but they are not suitable for turntablism and DJing, because the belt-drive motor does not like being slowed down, as it can stretch out the belt. Some DJs, most commonly those who play [[hip hop]] music, go beyond merely mixing records and use turntables as musical instruments for [[scratching]], [[beat juggling]], and other [[turntablism]] techniques.

===CDJs===
{{Main|CDJ}}
CDJs are high quality digital media players made for DJing. They often have large jog wheels and [[pitch control]]s to allow DJs to manipulate the playback of digital files for [[beatmatching]] similar to how DJs manipulate vinyl records on turntables. CDJs often have features such as loops and waveform displays similar to DJ software. Originally designed to play music from [[compact disc]]s, they now can play digital music files stored on [[USB flash drive]]s and [[Secure Digital|SD card]]s. Some CDJs can also connect to a computer running DJ software to act as a [[DJ controller]].

===DJ mixers===
{{Main|DJ mixer}}
[[File:DJ Mixer.JPG|thumb|upright|right|A [[Numark (DJ equipment)|Numark]] DM2002X Pro Master DJ mixer. This three channel mixer can have up to three input sound sources. The [[Gain (electronics)|gain]] control knobs and [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] control knobs allow the volume and tone of each sound source to be adjusted. The vertical faders allow for further adjustment of the volume of each sound source. The horizontally-mounted [[crossfader (audio engineering)|crossfader]] enables the DJ to smoothly transition from a [[song]] on one sound source to a song from a different sound source.]]
DJ mixers are small audio [[mixing console]]s specialized for DJing. Most DJ mixers have far fewer channels than a mixer used by a [[record producer]] or [[audio engineer]]; whereas standard live sound mixers in small venues have 12 to 24 channels, and standard [[recording studio]] mixers have even more (as many as 72 on large boards), basic DJ mixers may have only two channels. While DJ mixers have many of the same features found on larger mixers (faders, equalization knobs, gain knobs, [[effects unit]]s, etc.), DJ mixers have a feature that is usually only found on DJ mixers: the [[crossfader]]. The crossfader is a type of fader that is mounted horizontally. DJs used the crossfader to mix two or more sound sources. The midpoint of the crossfader's travel is a 50/50 mix of the two channels (on a two channel mixer). The far left side of the crossfader provides only the channel A sound source. The far right side provides only the channel B sound source (e.g., record player number 2). Positions in between the two extremes provide different mixes of the two channels. Some DJs use a computer with DJ software and a [[DJ controller]] instead of an analog DJ mixer to mix music, although DJ software can be used in conjunction with a hardware DJ mixer.

===Headphones===
{{Main|Headphones}}
DJs generally use higher quality headphones than those designed for music consumers. DJ headphones have other properties useful for DJs, such as designs that acoustically isolate the sounds of the headphones from the outside environment (hard shell headphones), flexible headbands and pivot joints to allow DJs to listen to one side of the headphones, while turning the other headphone away (so he/she can monitor the mix in the club), and replaceable cables. Replaceable cables enables DJs to buy new cables if a cable becomes frayed, worn, or damaged, or if a cable is accidentally cut.

Closed-back headphones are highly recommended for DJs to block outside noise as the environment of DJ usually tend to be very noisy. Standard headphones have 3.5mm jack but DJ equipment usually requires ¼ inch jack. Most of specialized DJ Headphones have an adapter to switch between 3.5mm jack and ¼ inch jack. Detachable coiled cables are perfect for DJ Headphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.getaheadphone.com/the-5-best-dj-headphones-of-2016/|title = Best DJ Headphones| accessdate =27 October 2016|year=2016|author=GetAHeadphone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
{{See also|List of music software#DJ software}}
[[File:Mixxx-1.11.0-Deere.png|thumb|left|A [[screenshot]] of [[Mixxx]] DJ software running on [[Mac OS X]]]]

DJs have changed their equipment as new technologies are introduced. The earliest DJs in pop music, in 1970s discos, used [[phonograph|record turntable]]s, vinyl records and [[audio console]]s. In the 1970s, DJs would have to lug heavy direct drive turntables and crates of records to clubs and shows. In the 1980s, many DJs transitioned to [[compact cassette]]s. In the 1990s and 2000s, many DJs switched to using [[digital audio]] such as [[CD]]s and [[MP3]] files. As technological advances made it practical to store large collections of digital music files on a [[laptop]] computer, DJ software was developed so DJs could use a laptop as a source of music instead of transporting CDs or vinyl records to gigs. Unlike most [[media player (software)|music player software]] designed for [[consumer electronics|regular consumers]], DJ software can play at least two audio files simultaneously, display the [[waveform]]s of the files on screen and enable the DJ to listen to either source.

The waveforms allow the DJ see what is coming next in the music and how the playback of different files is aligned. The software analyzes music files to identify their tempo and where the beats are. The analyzed information can be used by the DJ to help manually [[beatmatch]] like with vinyl records or the software can automatically synchronize the beats. [[Digital signal processing]] algorithms in software allow DJs to adjust the [[tempo]] of recordings independently of their [[pitch (music)|pitch]] (and musical [[key (music)|key]], a feature known as "keylock". Some software analyzes the loudness of the music for automatic normalization with [[ReplayGain]] and detects the musical key. Additionally, DJ software can store cue points, set loops, and apply [[effects unit|effects]].

As [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s became widespread, DJ software was written to run on these devices in addition to laptops.
DJ software requires specialized hardware in addition to a computer to fully take advantage of its features. The consumer grade, regular [[sound card]] integrated into most computer motherboards can only output two channels (one stereo pair). However, DJs need to be able to output at least four channels (two stereo pairs, thus Left and Right for input 1 and Left and Right for input 2), either unmixed signals to send to a DJ mixer or a main output plus a headphone output. Additionally, DJ sound cards output higher quality signals than the sound cards built into consumer-grade computer motherboards.

===Timecode===
Special vinyl records (or CDs/digital files played with [[CDJ]]s) can be used with DJ software to play digital music files with DJ software as if they were pressed onto vinyl, allowing [[turntablism]] techniques to be used with digital files. These vinyl records do not have music recordings pressed on to them. Instead, they are pressed with a special signal, referred to as "timecode", to control DJ software. The DJ software interprets changes in the playback speed, direction, and position of the timecode signal and manipulates the digital files it is playing in the same way that the turntable manipulates the timecode record.

This requires a specialized DJ [[sound card]] with at least 4 channels (2 stereo pairs) of inputs and outputs. With this setup, the DJ software typically outputs unmixed signals from the music files to an external hardware [[DJ mixer]]. Some DJ mixers have integrated [[USB]] sound cards that allow DJ software to connect directly to the mixer without requiring a separate sound card.

===DJ controllers===
{{Main|DJ controller}}
DJ software can be used to mix audio files on the computer instead of a separate hardware mixer. When mixing on a computer, DJs often use a [[DJ controller]] device that mimics the layout of two turntables plus a DJ mixer to control the software rather than the [[computer keyboard]] &amp; [[touchpad]] on a laptop, or the [[touchscreen]] on a [[tablet computer]] or [[smartphone]]. Many DJ controllers have an integrated [[sound card]] with 4 output channels (2 stereo pairs) that allows the DJ to use headphones to preview music before playing it on the main output.

===Other equipment===
* A [[microphone]], so that the DJ can introduce songs and speak to the audience over the sound system.
* Electronic [[effects unit]]s such as [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]], [[reverb]], [[octave]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]], [[chorus effect|chorus]], etc.
* Multi-stylus head shells, which allow a DJ to play different grooves of the same record at the same time.
* [[Sampler (musical instrument)|Sampler]]s, [[Music sequencer|sequencers]], electronic musical keyboards ([[synthesizer]]s), or [[drum machine]]s.
* [[PA system]] or [[sound reinforcement system]] ([[power amplifier]]s and [[speaker enclosure]]s), typically including [[subwoofer]] cabinets for deep bass (or, if a DJ is broadcasting and/or recording a set, broadcasting equipment or recording gear)
*[[Foldback (sound engineering)|Monitor speaker]]s, for listening to the "house mix" that is playing over the main speakers

==Techniques==
[[File:DJ Grand Wizzard Theodore (right), inventor of vinyl record scratching technique.jpg|thumb|In the early 1970s in the South Bronx, a young teen DJ named "Grand Wizzard Theodore" invented the "DJ scratch" technique. Other DJs, like Grandmaster Flash, took the technique to higher levels to the familiar sound and technique we hear today.]]
Several techniques are used by DJs as a means to better mix and blend recorded music. These techniques primarily include the [[cueing (playback)|cueing]], [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] and [[audio mixing (recorded music)|audio mixing]] of two or more sound sources. The complexity and frequency of special techniques depends largely on the setting in which a DJ is working. Radio DJs are less likely to focus on advanced music-mixing procedures than club DJs, who rely on a smooth transition between songs using a range of techniques. However, some radio DJs are experienced club DJs, so they use the same sophisticated mixing techniques.

Club DJ turntable techniques include [[beatmatching]], [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] and [[slip-cueing]] to preserve energy on a dance floor. [[Turntablism]] embodies the art of cutting, [[beat juggling]], [[scratching]], [[Needle drop (DJing)|needle drop]]s, [[phase shifting]], [[back spinning]] and more to perform the transitions and overdubs of [[Sampling (music)|samples]] in a more creative manner (although turntablism is often considered a use of the turntable as a [[musical instrument]] rather than a tool for blending recorded music). Professional DJs may use [[harmonic mixing]] to choose songs that are in compatible musical keys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harmonic mixing: The Basics|url=http://www.harmonic-mixing.com/HowTo.aspx|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DJ Mixes Remixes|url=http://www.surroundsounddj.com/dj-mixes-remixes/|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent advances in technology in both DJ hardware and software can provide assisted or automatic completion of some traditional DJ techniques and skills. Examples include [[phrasing (DJ)|phrasing]] and [[beatmatching]], which can be partially or completely automated by utilizing DJ software that performs automatic [[synchronization]] of sound recordings, a feature commonly labelled "sync". Most [[DJ mixer]]s now include a beat-counter which analyzes the tempo of an incoming sound source and displays its tempo in [[beats per minute]] (BPM), which may assist with beatmatching analog sound sources.

In the past, being a DJ has largely been a self-taught craft but with the complexities of new technologies and the convergence with music production methods, there are a growing number of schools and organizations that offer instruction on the techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/your-face-here/mitch-lee-and-sandro-petrillo-beat-drop-11934/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815205546/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/your-face-here/mitch-lee-and-sandro-petrillo-beat-drop-11934/ |archivedate=15 August 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miming===

In DJ culture, [[Miming in instrumental performance|miming]] refers to the practice of DJ's pantomiming the actions of live-mixing a set on stage while a pre-recorded mix plays over the sound system.&lt;ref name="Fonarow2006"&gt;Wendy Fonarow.

During a DJ tour for the release of the French group [[Justice (band)|Justice]]'s ''A Cross the Universe'' in November 2008, controversy arose when a photograph of Augé DJing with an unplugged [[Akai]] MPD24 surfaced. The photograph sparked accusations that Justice's live sets were faked. Augé has since said that the equipment was unplugged very briefly before being reattached and the band put a three-photo set of the incident on their MySpace page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
*''For the history of club DJs, see [[History of DJing]]''
*''For the history of radio DJs, see [[Radio disc jockey history]]''

The term "disc jockey" was ostensibly coined by radio gossip commentator [[Walter Winchell]] in 1935, and the phrase first appeared in print in a 1941 ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine, used to describe [[radio personality|radio personalities]] who introduced [[phonograph record]]s on the air.&lt;ref name="Trove"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/arts/music/17jazz.html?pagewanted=all|title=Museum Acquires Storied Trove of Performances by Jazz Greats|author=Rohter, Larry|date=16 August 2010|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite web|title=OED Appeals|url=http://public.oed.com/appeals/disc-jockey/|website=oed.com|publisher=Oxford English Dictionary|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing recorded music for dancing and parties rose with the mass marketing of home [[phonograph]]s in the late 19th century, and [[Jimmy Savile]] is credited with hosting the first live DJ dance party in 1943. Savile is also credited as the first to present music in continuous play by using multiple turntables. In 1947, the Whiskey A Go-Go opened in Paris as the first [[discoteque]].&lt;ref name="UF"&gt;{{cite web|title=So You Want To Be A DJ? History|url=http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/fall09/bein_k/history.html|website=UF Interactive Media Lab|publisher=University of Florida|accessdate=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, [[Rudy Bozak]] began making the first [[DJ mixer]]s, mixing consoles specialized for DJing.

In the 1960s, [[Sound system (Jamaican)|Jamaican sound system]] culture emerged, with Jamaican [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejay]]s such as [[King Tubby]] and [[Lee "Scratch" Perry]] pioneering [[dub music]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="veal"&gt;Michael Veal (2013), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kYtiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP54 ''Dub: Soundscapes and Shattered Songs in Jamaican Reggae'', pages 26-44, "Electronic Music in Jamaica"], [[Wesleyan University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cambridge20"&gt;Nicholas Collins, Margaret Schedel, Scott Wilson (2013), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bQeAtG97BmEC&amp;pg=PA20 ''Electronic Music: Cambridge Introductions to Music'', page 20], [[Cambridge University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; They experimented with [[Tape music|tape-based composition]], emphasized repetitive rhythmic structures (often stripped of their harmonic elements), electronically manipulated spatiality, sonically manipulated pre-recorded musical materials from mass media, deejays toasted (boastful chanting) over pre-recorded music,&lt;ref name="veal"/&gt; and they [[remix]]ed music.&lt;ref name="cambridge20"/&gt; Jamaican deejays later had a significant impact on hip hop DJs in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="veal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cambridge20"/&gt;

[[File:Technics 1200 and Xone 42 1 2016-06-17.jpg|thumb|right|Two [[Technics SL-1200]] turntables set up for DJ use. A [[DJ mixer]] is placed between the two turntables.]]
DJ [[turntablism]] has origins in the invention of [[direct-drive turntable]]s. Early [[belt-drive turntable]]s were unsuitable for turntablism and mixing, since they had a slow start-up time, and they were prone to wear-and-tear and breakage,&lt;ref name="medium"&gt;Brian Coleman, [https://medium.com/@briancoleman/the-technics-1200-hammer-of-the-gods-xxl-fall-1998-5b93180a67da The Technics 1200 — Hammer Of The Gods], [[Medium (website)|Medium]]&lt;/ref&gt; as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LApZ8KV7bZAC&amp;pg=PA43 ''The World of DJs and the Turntable Culture'', page 43], [[Hal Leonard Corporation]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at [[Panasonic|Matsushita]] (now [[Panasonic]]),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', 21 May 1977, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XCMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT140 page 140]&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Osaka]], [[Japan]].&lt;ref name="medium"/&gt; It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests.&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Trevor Pinch, Karin Bijsterveld, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KuRfLG0IedYC&amp;pg=PA515 ''The Oxford Handbook of Sound Studies'', page 515], [[Oxford University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Matsushita released it as the [[Technics (brand)|SP-10]],&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; the first direct-drive turntable on the market,&lt;ref name="reverb"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Record Player Part II: The Rise and Fall|url=https://reverb.com/news/history-of-the-record-player-part-ii-the-rise-and-fall|website=[[Reverb.com]]|accessdate=5 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first in their influential [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] series of turntables.&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt;

In 1972, Technics started making their [[Technics SL-1200|SL-1200 turntable]], which became the most popular turntable for DJs due to its high torque [[direct-drive turntable|direct drive]] design.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;[https://www.wired.com/2002/05/blackbox/ Six Machines That Changed The Music World], ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', May 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The SL-1200 had a rapid start and its durable direct drive enabled DJs to manipulate the platter, as with scratching techniques. [[Hip hop]] DJs began using the Technics SL-1200s as musical instruments to manipulate records with [[turntablism]] techniques such as [[scratching]] and [[beat juggling]] rather than merely mixing records. These techniques were developed in the 1970s by [[DJ Kool Herc]], [[Grand Wizard Theodore]], and [[Afrika Bambaataa]], as they experimented with Technics direct-drive decks, finding that the motor would continue to spin at the correct [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter.&lt;ref name="wired"/&gt; Although Technics stopped producing the SL-1200 in 2010, they remain the most popular DJ turntable due to their high build quality and durability.

In 1980, Japanese company [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] released the [[Roland TR-808|TR-808]], an analog [[Drum machine|rhythm/drum machine]], which has unique artificial sounds, such as its booming [[Bass drum|bass]] and sharp [[Snare drum|snare]], and a [[metronome]]-like [[rhythm]]. [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'s use of the instrument in 1980 influenced hip hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa, after which the TR-808 would be widely adopted by hip hop DJs, with 808 sounds remaining central to hip hop music ever since.&lt;ref name="kulkarni"&gt;Neil Kulkarni (2015), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ysyiCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA44 ''The Periodic Table of HIP HOP'', page 44], [[Random House]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="808film"&gt;[[808 (film)|''808'' (documentary film)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roland TB-303]], a [[bass synthesizer]] released in 1981, had a similar impact on [[electronic dance music]] genres such as [[techno]] and [[house music]],&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vine|first=Richard|title=Tadao Kikumoto invents the Roland TB-303|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/tadao-kikumoto-roland|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=9 July 2011|date=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kulkarni"/&gt; along with Roland's TR-808&lt;ref name="808film"/&gt; and [[TR-909]] drum machines.&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;http://complex.com/music/2014/09/roland-tr-909-tracks/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mixmag"&gt;http://mixmag.net/feature/909-tracks-using-the-tr-909&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the [[Compact Disc]] (CD) format was released, popularizing [[digital audio]]. In 1998, the first MP3 digital audio player was released, the Eiger Labs MPMan F10. Final Scratch debuted at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to allow DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded vinyl records or CDs. While it would take sometime for this novel concept to catch on with the "die hard Vinyl DJs", This would soon become the first step in the new Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJing pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam (a.k.a. William P. Rader), who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the "CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit", to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.

In 2001, [[Pioneer DJ]] began producing the [[CDJ#CDJ-1000|CDJ-1000]] [[CD player]], making the use of digital music recordings with traditional DJ techniques practical for the first time. As the 2000s progressed, [[laptop]] computers became more powerful and affordable. [[#Software|DJ software]], specialized DJ [[sound card]]s, and [[DJ controller]]s were developed for DJs to use laptops as a source of music rather than turntables or CDJs. In the 2010s, like laptops before them, [[tablet computer]]s and [[smartphone]]s became more powerful &amp; affordable. DJ software was written to run on these more portable devices instead of laptops, although laptops remain the more common type of computer for DJing.

== Women DJs ==
[[File:FemaleDJ.jpg|thumb|upright|right|A DJ mixing two record players at a live event.]]
In Western [[popular music]], [[Women in music|women musicians]] have achieved great success in singing and songwriting roles, however, there are relatively few women DJs or turntablists. Part of this may stem from a general low percentage of women in audio technology-related jobs. A 2013 ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' article stated that there are "...few women in [[Music producer|record production]] and [[sound engineering]]."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ncube |first=Rosina |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women In Audio? |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/sep13/articles/sounding-off-0913.htm |journal=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ncube states that "[n]inety-five percent of music producers are male, and although there are female producers achieving great things in music, they are less well-known than their male counterparts."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;  The vast majority of students in music technology programs are male. In [[hip hop music]], the low percentage of women DJs and turntablists may stem from the overall male domination of the entire hip hop music industry. Most of the top rappers, MCs, DJs, record producers and music executives are men. There are a small number of high-profile women, but they are rare. 
[[File:Dj Virgin .jpg|thumb|left|DJ Virgin is a London, UK-based DJ. She is pictured mixing with a Pioneer DJ Controller, which can replicate the sound of vinyl record players.]]
In 2007 Mark Katz's article "Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle," stated that "very few women [do turntablism] battle[s]; the matter has been a topic of conversation among hip-hop DJs for years."&lt;ref name="gender"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Mark|date=12 December 2007|title=Men, Women, and Turntables: Gender and the DJ Battle|url=https://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/4/580.full#fn-9|journal=The Musical Quarterly|doi=10.1093/musqtl/gdm007|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Rebekah Farrugia states "the male-centricity of EDM culture" contributes to "a marginalisation of women in these [EDM] spaces." &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Dance Floor: Female DJs, Technology and Electronic Dance Music Culture|last=Farrugia|first=Rebekah|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1841505664|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While turntablism and broader DJ practices should not be conflated, Katz suggests use or lack of use of the turntable broadly by women across genres and disciplines is impacted upon by what he defines as "male [[technophilia]]."&lt;ref name="gender" /&gt; Historian Ruth Oldenziel concurs in her writing on engineering with this idea of socialization as a central factor in the lack of engagement with technology. She explains: "an exclusive focus on women's supposed failure to enter the field … is insufficient for understanding how our stereotypical notions have come into being; it tends to put the burden of proof entirely on women and to blame them for their supposedly inadequate socialization, their lack of aspiration, and their want of masculine values. An equally challenging question is why and how boys have come to love things technical, how boys have historically been socialized as technophiles."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oldenziel|first=Ruth A.|date=1997|title=Boys and Their Toys: The Fisher Body Craftsman's Guild, 1930–1968, and the Making of a Male Technical Domain|url=|journal=Technology and Culture|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lucy Green has focused on gender in relation to musical performers and creators, and specifically on educational frameworks as they relate to both.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Music, Gender, Education|last=Green|first=Lucy|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0521555227|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She suggests that women's alienation from "areas that have a strong technological tendency such as DJ-ing, sound engineering and producing" are "not necessarily about her dislike of these instruments but relates to the interrupting effect of their dominantly masculine delineations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.genderandeducation.com/resources/subjects/music/|title=Music – GEA – Gender and Education Association|website=www.genderandeducation.com|access-date=2016-03-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303093403/http://www.genderandeducation.com/resources/subjects/music/|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, women and girls do increasingly engage in turntable and DJ practices, individually&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bpmsupreme.com/female-turntablists-on-the-rise/|title=Female Turntablists on the Rise|website=BPMSUPREME TV|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/02/17/female-dj-crews-discwoman-sister-mahoyo-tgaf|title=9 All-Female DJ Collectives You Need To Know Right Now|website=The FADER|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "carve out spaces for themselves in EDM and DJ Culture".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A 2015 article cited a number of prominent female DJs: [[Hannah Wants]],  [[Ellen Allien]],  [[Miss Kittin]], [[Monika Kruse]], [[Nicole Moudaber]], [[B.Traits]], [[Magda]], [[Nina Kraviz]], [[Nervo (DJs)|Nervo]], and [[Annie Mac]].&lt;ref name="Fes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robertson|first1=Joel|title=TOP 10: Female DJs|url=https://www.festicket.com/de/magazine/discover/top-female-djs/|website=Festicket Magazine|publisher=Festicke Ltd.|accessdate=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dreamgirls'''''  is a 2006 American [[Romance film|romantic]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] written and directed by [[Bill Condon]] and jointly produced and released by [[DreamWorks|DreamWorks Pictures]] and [[Paramount Pictures]]. Adapted from the 1981 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[Musical theatre|musical]] [[Dreamgirls|of the same name]] by composer [[Henry Krieger]] and lyricist/librettist [[Tom Eyen]], ''Dreamgirls'' is a [[film à clef]], a work of fiction taking strong inspiration from the history of the [[Motown]] record label and one of its acts, [[The Supremes]].&lt;ref&gt;(Feb 2, 2007). "[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/feb/02/urban.awardsandprizes I literally pinch myself every day]." ''The Guardian''. Retrieved 2007-02-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The story follows the history and evolution of American [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] music during the 1960s and 1970s through the eyes of a [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] [[girl group]] known as the Dreams and their manipulative record executive.

The film adaptation of ''Dreamgirls'' stars [[Jamie Foxx]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Eddie Murphy]], and [[Jennifer Hudson]], and also features [[Danny Glover]], [[Anika Noni Rose]] and [[Keith Robinson (actor)|Keith Robinson]]. Produced by [[Laurence Mark]], the film's screenplay was adapted by director Condon from the original Broadway book by Tom Eyen. In addition to the original Kreiger/Eyen compositions, four new songs, composed by Krieger with various lyricists, were added for this film.&lt;ref name="newmusic" /&gt; ''Dreamgirls'' features the acting debut of Hudson, a former ''[[American Idol]]'' contestant and singer.

The film debuted in four special [[Roadshow theatrical release|road show]] engagements starting on December 15, 2006, before its nationwide release on December 25, 2006.&lt;ref name="roadshow" /&gt; With a production cost of $80 million, ''Dreamgirls'' is one of the most expensive films to feature an all [[African Americans|African-American]] starring cast in American cinema history.&lt;ref name="MostExpensive" /&gt; Upon its release, the film garnered positive reviews from critics, who particularly praised the performances of Hudson and Murphy.

&lt;!--Do not add extra content to this plot summary. You are free to revise/reword it, but plot summaries are not to exceed 700 words on Wikipedia--&gt;
In 1962 [[Detroit, Michigan]], young car salesman Curtis Taylor Jr. meets a black [[girl group]] known as "The Dreamettes", which consists of lead singer Effie White and backup singers Deena Jones and Lorrell Robinson, at an R&amp;B amateur talent show at the Detroit Theatre. Curtis presents himself as The Dreamettes' new manager and arranges for the girls to become backup singers for [[chitlin' circuit]] R&amp;B star Jimmy "Thunder" Early.

Curtis soon starts his own record label, Rainbow Records, out of his Detroit car dealership, and appoints Effie's brother C.C as his head songwriter. When their first single fails after a white pop group releases a [[cover version]], Curtis, C.C., and their producer Wayne turn to [[payola]] to make "Jimmy Early &amp; The Dreamettes" mainstream pop stars. Offstage, Effie becomes infatuated with Curtis while the married Jimmy begins an affair with Lorrell.

Jimmy's manager, Marty Madison, grows weary of Curtis' plans to make his client more pop-friendly and walks out. When Jimmy bombs in front of an all-white [[Miami Beach]] [[supper club]] audience, Curtis sends Jimmy out on the road alone, keeping The Dreamettes behind to headline in his place. Feeling that Effie's plus-sized figure and distinctive voice will not attract white audiences, Curtis appoints the slimmer and higher-voiced Deena lead singer and renames the group "The Dreams".

With the aid of new songs and a new image, Curtis and C.C. transform The Dreams into a top-selling mainstream pop group. By 1965, however, Effie begins acting out, particularly when Curtis' affections also turn towards Deena. Curtis eventually drops Effie from the group, hiring his secretary Michelle Morris to take her place beginning with their 1966 [[New Year's Eve]] debut in [[Las Vegas]] as "Deena Jones &amp; the Dreams." Despite Effie's defiance and desperate appeal to Curtis, he, C.C., and The Dreams leave her behind and forge ahead to stardom.

By 1973, Effie has become an impoverished [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] mother living in Detroit with her daughter Magic. Struggling to restart her career in music, she hires Marty as her manager and begins performing at a local club. Meanwhile, with Deena Jones &amp; the Dreams superstars and Rainbow having moved to [[Los Angeles]] and now the biggest pop business in the country, Curtis attempts to produce a film about [[Cleopatra]] starring an unwilling Deena, who is now his wife.

The following year, Jimmy, who has descended into drug addiction due to Curtis' preoccupation with Deena, along with the rejection of the charity single he recorded, has a breakdown during Rainbow Records' tenth-anniversary television special. Curtis promptly drops him from the label and Lorrell ends their affair. Sometime later, C.C., who feels Curtis is undermining the [[artistic merit]] of his songs by making them into [[disco music]], quits the label, only for everyone to then learn that Jimmy has been found dead from a [[heroin]] overdose.

Disillusioned by Jimmy's death and Curtis' cold reaction to the news, C.C. travels to Detroit and reconciles with Effie, for whom C.C. writes and produces a comeback single. Just as the record begins gaining local radio play, Curtis uses payola to force radio stations to play The Dreams' [[disco]] cover of the song. The plan falls apart, however, when Deena, angry over how Curtis controls her career, finds evidence of his schemes and contacts Effie, who arrives in Los Angeles with C.C., Marty, and a lawyer.

Deena and Effie reconcile, with Effie revealing to Deena that Curtis is Magic's father, while Curtis agrees to give Effie's record national distribution in order to avoid being reported to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Having been inspired by Effie's victory and realizing Curtis' true character, Deena leaves him to make it on her own.

By 1975, The Dreams give a final farewell performance at the Detroit Theater and invite Effie onstage for the final song. As the concert ends, Curtis notices Magic in the front row and realizes she is his daughter.

==Production==

===Pre-production===
Since the 1980s and 1990s, several different attempts have been made to produce a film adaptation of ''[[Dreamgirls (musical)|Dreamgirls]]'', a Broadway musical loosely based upon the story of [[The Supremes]] and [[Motown Records]], which won six [[Tony Awards]] in 1982. [[David Geffen]], the stage musical's co-financier, retained the film rights to ''Dreamgirls'' and turned down many offers to adapt the story for the screen. He cited a need to preserve the integrity of ''Dreamgirls'' stage director [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]]'s work after his death in 1987.&lt;ref name="DavidGeffen"&gt;Marr, Melissa (Dec 8, 2006).

Retrieved on December 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Geffen, who ran his [[Warner Bros.]]-associated [[The Geffen Film Company|Geffen Pictures]] film production company at the time, began talks with Broadway lyricist and producer [[Howard Ashman]] to adapt it as a star vehicle for [[Whitney Houston]], who was to portray Deena. The production ran into problems when Houston wanted to sing both Deena and Effie's songs (particularly "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going"), and the film was eventually abandoned.&lt;ref name="EarlyMovieVers"&gt;Hill, Jeremy.

When Geffen co-founded DreamWorks in 1994 and dissolved Geffen Pictures, the rights to ''Dreamgirls'' remained with Warner Bros. Warner planned to go ahead with the film with director [[Joel Schumacher]] and screenwriter [[Tina Andrews]] &lt;ref name="newmusic" /&gt; in the late 1990s, following the success of [[Touchstone Pictures]]'s [[Tina Turner]] biopic ''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (film)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]''. Schumacher planned to have [[Lauryn Hill]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fugees' Lauryn Hill Eyed For "Dreamgirls"|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1429235/19980716/fugees.jhtml|work=MTV.com|publisher=MTV Networks|accessdate=17 May 2010|date=16 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; portray Deena and [[Kelly Price]] play Effie. After Warner's [[Frankie Lymon]] biopic ''[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (film)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]'' failed at the box office, the studio shut down development on ''Dreamgirls''.&lt;ref name="EarlyMovieVers" /&gt;

DreamWorks' ''Dreamgirls'' adaptation came about after the film version of the Broadway musical ''[[Chicago (2002 film)|Chicago]]'' was a success at both the box office and the [[Academy Awards]]. Screenwriter and director [[Bill Condon]], who wrote ''Chicago''{{'}}s screenplay, met producer [[Laurence Mark]] at a Hollywood holiday party in late 2002, where the two discussed a long-held "dream project" of Condon's&amp;nbsp;– adapting ''Dreamgirls'' for the screen.&lt;ref name="radio"&gt;{{Cite episode| title = "Dreamgirls" with Writer/Director Bill Condon| episodelink = | url = http://www.kcet.org/socal/cinema_series/dreamgirls-with-writerdirector-bill-condon.html| series = KCET Cinema Series| serieslink = | credits = | network = [[PBS]]| station = [[KCET]]| location = [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]| airdate = 2006-12-06| minutes = 2:34| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110621232320/http://www.kcet.org/socal/cinema_series/dreamgirls-with-writerdirector-bill-condon.html| archivedate = June 21, 2011| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two had dinner with Geffen and successfully convinced him to allow Condon to write a screenplay for ''Dreamgirls''.&lt;ref&gt;Ulmer, James (Sept. 10, 2006).

===Stage to script changes===
While much of the stage musical's story remains intact, a number of significant changes were made. The Dreams' hometown—the setting for much of the action—was moved from [[Chicago]] to Detroit, the real-life hometown of [[The Supremes]] and [[Motown Records]].&lt;ref name="DavidGeffen" /&gt; The roles of many of the characters were related more closely to their real-life inspirations, following a suggestion by Geffen.&lt;ref name="DavidGeffen" /&gt;

Warner Bros. had retained the film rights to ''Dreamgirls'', and agreed to co-produce with DreamWorks. However, after casting was completed, the film was budgeted at $73 million and Warner backed out of the production. Geffen, taking the role of co-producer, brought Paramount Pictures in to co-finance and release ''Dreamgirls''. During the course of production, Paramount's parent company, [[Viacom]], would purchase DreamWorks, aligning the two studios under one umbrella (and giving the senior studio US distribution rights on behalf of DreamWorks).&lt;ref name="DavidGeffen" /&gt; The completed film had a production budget of $75 million, making ''Dreamgirls'' the most expensive film with an all-black starring cast in cinema history.&lt;ref name="MostExpensive"&gt;Gottfried, Marvin (2007).

Following the success of the Cannes screening, DreamWorks and Paramount began a widespread "[[For Your Consideration (advertising)|For Your Consideration]]" advertisement campaign, raising several eyebrows by demoting Jennifer Hudson to consideration for Best Supporting Actress and presenting Beyoncé Knowles as the sole Best Actress candidate, as opposed to having both compete for Best Actress awards. By contrast, the actresses who originated Hudson's and Knowles' roles on Broadway, Jennifer Holliday and [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]], respectively, were both nominated for the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress, with Holliday winning the award.&lt;ref name="HudsonSupporting" /&gt; The presentation of Knowles over Hudson as the sole Best Actress candidate had interesting parallels with the film itself.&lt;ref name="HudsonSupporting" /&gt;

''Dreamgirls'' received eight 2007 [[Academy Award]] nominations covering six categories, the most of any film for the year, although it was not nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], or either of the lead acting categories.

To give the story more exposure for the upcoming film release, DreamWorks and the licenser of the original play, The Tams-Witmark Music Library, announced that they would pay the licensing fees for all non-professional stage performances of ''Dreamgirls'' for the calendar year of 2006. DreamWorks hoped to encourage amateur productions of ''Dreamgirls'', and familiarize a wider audience with the play. As a result, more than fifty high schools, colleges, community theaters, and other non-commercial theater entities staged productions of ''Dreamgirls'' in 2006, and DreamWorks spent up to $250,000 subsidizing the licensing.&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, Mark (Dec. 12, 2006).

Since the beginning of the [[Dadaism]] in the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], [[Zurich]] in 1916, many artists have experimented with '''extreme performance art''' as a critique of contemporary consumer culture. Some have used bodily fluids such as blood, faeces and urine. Other times they perform self-mutilation. Simulated (artificial) blood has also been used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://heatst.com/culture-wars/feminists-perform-bloody-mock-abortion-on-virgin-mary-in-front-of-cathedral/ "Feminists Perform Bloody Mock Abortion on ‘Virgin Mary’ In Front of Cathedral"]. [[Heat Street]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s extreme performance was elevated to a movement with the [[Viennese actionists]]. In recent times there has been a resurgence in extreme performance as a response to the increasing alienation some artists feel in the face of today's technological advances.

'''Garros Galería''' or Garros Gallery is located in [[Colonia Roma]] in [[Mexico City]]. It is the only art gallery and museum dedicated to cats in [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="esquivel"&gt;{{cite news |title= Convierta su afición en una próspera actividad empresarial |author= Gerardo Esquivel |newspaper= Empresas y Empresarios |location=Mexico City |date=June 29, 2008 |page=5  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Convert their passion into a prosperous enterprise }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The enterprise was begun by siblings Joel and María del Carmen Nava Polina, along with Rodrigo Moreno González, who realized that there were cat museums in the United States, Canada and the [[Bahamas]] but not in Mexico. Both come from a family of cat lovers with fifteen cats between them currently. They had also built a large collection of cat-related items over the years. The gallery began in 2006 by gathering various artists and friends to donate and put works for the gallery on consignment.&lt;ref name="arosas"&gt;{{cite news |title=Arte felino, negocio sagrado |author=Ana María Rosas |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulos/46581.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=April 13, 2008 |accessdate=May 18, 2012 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Feline art, sacred business |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623220810/http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulos/46581.html |archivedate=June 23, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the gallery has had success because it caters to a niche market which had not been served previously. Sales have included those to Europe through the Internet.&lt;ref name="esquivel"/&gt;

Since it opened, the gallery has been featured on various television shows including [[TV Azteca]] and [[Once TV México|Once TV]].&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/user/garrosccr |title=Garros Todo en Gatos Galería |publisher=Garros Galería |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |accessdate=May 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Garros05.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Fideo, resident cat of the gallery]]
It is located in Colonia Roma, which is known for having a large number of galleries, boutiques and specialty stores.&lt;ref name="laruta"&gt;{{cite news |title= Colonia Roma: La Ruta del Diseño |newspaper= Publimetro |location=Mexico City |date=January 11, 2008 |page=12  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Colonia Roma: The Design Route }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the gallery is dedicated to art and [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|handcrafts]] with cat themes with the aim of supporting artists and artisans both from Mexico and abroad as well as promoting cats aesthetically.&lt;ref name="arosas"/&gt;  It works with over one hundred designers, artists and artisans to create its line of products.&lt;ref name="laruta"/&gt; The catalog includes over 5,000 pieces which includes handcrafts, pillows, paintings, T-shirts, jewelry, cups, toys, photographs, watches and books. Prices range from twenty pesos for a lollipop and 45 pesos for earrings to over 8,000 for an oil painting.&lt;ref name="esquivel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="arosas"/&gt; The merchandise focuses on original art and handcrafts, ensuring that customers are buying items available nowhere else and not buying knock offs or illegal copies of commercial products. Customers include cat aficionados or friends/family of such, curious people who pass by the site and tourists.&lt;ref name="esquivel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="luzhaw"&gt;{{cite news |title= Atraen con arte a amantes de los gatos |newspaper= Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=December 29, 2006 |page=12  |language=Spanish |trans-title=Attract lovers of cats with art }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the creators who work with the gallery include Daniel Soler, Serioshka Hellmund, Roxana Elvridge-Thomas, Ricardo Ham, Karina Falcón, Iris México, Miguel Ángel Tenorio, Guillermo León, James Tomon and [[Ana Karen Allende]].&lt;ref name="luzhaw"/&gt;

The logo for the gallery is “El gato Dedrita” (Dedrita the cat) designed by Joel Nava Polina which represents the playful nature of cats and of their admirers.&lt;ref name="luzhaw"/&gt;

The gallery also sponsors exhibitions and other events not related to cats but with the aim of promoting local artists.&lt;ref name="arosas"/&gt; It has shown works by artists such as Jesús Topete, Fumiko Nakashima and Kodai Kita.&lt;ref name="luzhaw"/&gt;

==Gato Sombra==
The Gato Sombra is a painting of a cat which was owned by artist Odette Paz before it died. The painting has its own niche in the gallery where it is claimed by the artist and others to grant favors for those petitioners who believe in it.&lt;ref name="luzhaw"/&gt;  Petitioners write small notes to leave with the image.&lt;ref name="tvazteca"&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Garros Bazar Artístico Temático Todo en Gatos |episodelink= |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suPTks7hbQ0&amp;list=UU8AlV1qZP2PZCiUJJzNOFnA&amp;index=3&amp;feature=plcp&amp;noredirect=1 |accessdate=May 18, 2012 |series=Venga La Alegria |network=TV Azteca |location=Mexico City |date= May 6, 2008  |time=11:37 am |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gallery also sells small images with a prayer.&lt;ref name="luzhaw"/&gt;

'''''{{lang|de|Generalmusikdirektor}}''''' (GMD, general [[music director]]) is a German title for the artistic director of an [[orchestra]], an institution or a town.&lt;ref name="mer132"&gt;Gerald Mertens: ''Orchestermanagement.'' VS – Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, Wiesbaden 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-531-16584-4}}, S. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A music director (Latin: ''director musices'') was originally the title of the person responsible for music in a town in Germany and Austria. [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] was music director in [[Leipzig]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]] and later [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] were music directors in [[Hamburg]], [[Robert Schumann]] was music director in [[Düsseldorf]].&lt;ref&gt;''Musikdirektor'' in: Brockhaus Riemann Musiklexikon, p. 7134; BRM Bd. 3, S. 177) (c) [[Schott Music|Schott]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Generalmusikdirektor'' is a title given by larger towns to a person typically responsible for a symphony orchestra and the opera. The first person with this title was [[Gaspare Spontini]] in Berlin  in 1819. Currently, [[Daniel Barenboim]] has been ''Generalmusikdirektor'' of the [[Staatsoper Unter den Linden]] in Berlin from 1992.

'''''Grönköpings Veckoblad''''' is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[satire|satirical]] monthly magazine. The name translates as "''The Grönköping Weekly''", or "''The Greenville Weekly''", Grönköping being a fictional Swedish town.&lt;ref name="sala"&gt;{{cite book|author=Salvatore Attardo|title=Encyclopedia of Humor Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjRzAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA473|accessdate=12 August 2015|date=18 March 2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4833-4617-5|page=473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Grönköping predates the magazine; it was first used by [[Albert Engström]] as a headline for some of his drawings in 1895.&lt;ref name="DKG"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Kylhammar|author2= Göran B.

==History and profile==
Founded in 1902&lt;ref name=sala/&gt; by [[Hasse Zetterström]] as a supplement to ''[[Söndags-Nisse]]'', it became an independent magazine in 1916. The current [[editor in chief]]  of the magazine is Ulf Schöldström.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TTSpektra|url=http://archive.corren.se/archive/2008/9/8/jvptaduw21ry8r6.xml |title=Ny chef för Grönköpings Veckoblad|work=Östgöta Correspondenten|accessdate=22 February 2009|date=8 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parody language [[Transpiranto]], a caricature of [[Esperanto]], was introduced in a 1929 article by [[Nils Hasselskog]],  "World language in Grönköping's school" ("Världsspråk i Grönköpings skola").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gunilla Byrman|url=https://open.lnu.se/index.php/hn/article/view/43/38|title=Europanto eller svenska?|work=HumaNetten|accessdate=27 October 2016|date=20 October 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Grönköping'' has been characterized as a Sweden in miniature. Using bombastic and anachronistic language while purporting to describe and analyse current events in a serious manner, ''Grönköpings Veckoblad'' has become a Swedish institution and a standard for what is considered good satire.&lt;ref name="PIS"&gt;{{cite book

The '''interior portrait''' ('''portrait d'intérieur''') or, in German, '''Zimmerbild''' (room picture), is a pictorial genre that appeared in Europe near the end of the 17th century and enjoyed a great vogue in the second half of the 19th century. It involves a careful, detailed representation of a living space, without any people. These paintings were generally rendered as [[watercolor]]s and required great technical mastery, if little creativity. By the mid-20th century, although such scenes were still being created, photography had changed this style of painting into a form of intentional archaism.

==Birth of the genre==
The interior portrait should not be confused with what is called a "[[conversation piece]]" in England; a term which designates a scene with a group of people engaged in some activity and often placed outdoors. The true interior piece shows only the room and decor, although previous activity may be suggested by the placement of articles in the room.

This type of scene first appears near the end of the 17th century. At that time, the intent was entirely descriptive. They were usually done specifically to show the contents of an art gallery, personal library or [[cabinet of curiosities]]. One of the first known examples depicts the library of [[Samuel Pepys]] in London, dating from 1693. They are still valued today by researchers and decorators. In the case of Pepys, it can be seen, firsthand, how a scholar of that time arranges his books in a bookcase (an innovation at that time), uses a lectern, places cushions for his comfort, hangs maps, etc. 
[[File:Boxbarth after Feuillet Library interior c1700.jpg|thumb|left|Library project, c.1700. Engraving by Johann Boxbarth (fl.1690–1710)]]
It was not until the last quarter of the 18th century that a new type of interior portrait with a different intent made its appearance. This type first arose in architectural firms and was done for the benefit of their clients. Great architects such as the [[James Adam (architect)|James Adam]] and his brother [[Robert Adam]] of Scotland and [[François-Joseph Bélanger]] would execute watercolors of their previous projects to entice prospective customers. This created a fad among the wealthy and the nobility to commission paintings of their own rooms, to show off and preserve for posterity. These paintings were often compiled into albums. This craze was particularly prevalent in England. From there, it spread widely throughout Europe.

==Apogee in the 19th century==
[[File:Zimmerbild 83.jpg|thumb|The psychological dimensions of décor: interior portrait by Leopold Zielcke (1791–1861). Berlin, 1825]]

The first historically important example of the interior portrait represents a small art gallery set up by the [[Empress Josephine]] at [[Château de Malmaison|Malmaison]] in 1812. In this watercolor by [[Auguste-Siméon Garneray]], we can see her harp, art collection and her shawl, left on an armchair. Thus a new element appears: the psychological elements of the décor and a palpable human presence. One can feel the owner's emotions and thoughts. In this sense, the paintings have truly become "portraits".&lt;ref&gt;''An Illustrated History of Interior Decoration, From Pompeii to Art Nouveau'' by [[Mario Praz]], Thames &amp; Hudson, {{ISBN|0-500-23358-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Premazzi parlour.jpg|thumb|225px|The "petit salon rouge" at the [[Alexander Palace]] in [[Tsarskoye Selo]], by [[Luigi Premazzi]] (c.1855)]]

The immense popularity of these paintings in the 19th century can be explained by many factors. Among the [[nouveau-riche]] and the [[bourgeoisie]], great importance was given to the home as a place of comfort, intimacy and family. This period also saw a specialization (e.g. separate dining rooms) that were once known only to the very wealthy. These new "middle-classes" were also eager to copy aristocratic tastes and industrialization made a much wider variety of furniture easily affordable. Finally, decorative styles were constantly being changed and resurrected, so interior portraits were a way of preserving one's memories and bequeathing them to the next generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperhewitt.org/search/House%20Proud Exhibition Archive: ''House Proud'', Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Queen Victoria]] was very fond of these portraits as they allowed her to give the public a look at her loving family life and the comforts of home in a tasteful manner.&lt;ref&gt;''La dernière reine : Victoria, 1819-1901'' by Philippe Alexandre and Béatrix de l'Aulnoit, Robert Laffont, Paris 2000, {{ISBN|2-221-09064-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The craze was thereby spread throughout the Royal Families of Europe. Due to the number of lavishly decorated palaces they possessed ([[The Winter Palace]],  [[Tsarskoye Selo]], [[Gatchina Palace]], [[Peterhof Palace]], [[Pavlovsk Palace]]...), the Tsars were among the most enthusiastic commissioners of interior portraits. Virtually all of their rooms (except the most private ones) were rendered at least once; some several times. These watercolors are considered to be among the best of their genre.&lt;ref&gt;in ''Vues des palais impériaux des environs de Saint-Petersbourg'', collected under the direction of Emmanuel Ducamp, edited by Alain de Gourcuff, Paris 1992, {{ISBN|2-909838-00-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speciality artists==
[[File:Ludwig Passini - The Salone of the Palazzo Barbaro.jpg|thumb|Salon of the [[Palazzo Barbaro]], [[Venice]]. [[Ludwig Passini]] (1855)]]
[[File:Zimmerbild 99.jpg|thumbnail|[[Ferdinand Rothbart]], Coburg 1848]]

At a time when every cultured young woman learned to paint watercolors, many painted their own rooms or the ones where they were given their lessons. Most of the surviving examples are anonymous and rarely of high quality, but they often have a charm that compensates for what they lack in technical expertise.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte Gere, ''L'époque et son style, la décoration intérieure au XIXe siècle'', Flammarion, Paris 1989, {{ISBN|978-2-08-010971-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Thornton]], ''Authentic Decor: The Domestic Interior 1620-1920'', Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 1986, {{ISBN|0-297-83239-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some members of the aristocracy had real talent, verging on the professional. The Polish Count [[Artur Potocki]], for example, travelled widely, painting watercolors of the hotel rooms and other places where he stayed, from Rome to London.

Nevertheless, virtually all the highest-quality works were produced by professionals with exceptional virtuosity in watercolors and a mastery of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]]...especially conical perspective, with two or three [[vanishing point]]s, which produces an eerily photographic effect for modern eyes.

With only a few exceptions, such as [[Jean-Baptiste Isabey]] and [[Eugène Lami]] of France, architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and furniture-maker [[Thomas Sheraton]] (both of England), few artists who dealt exclusively with these portraits are still familiar today. Among some notable artists who produced them, not previously mentioned:
* In England: [[William Henry Hunt (painter)|William Henry Hunt]], [[Mary Ellen Best]],  [[William Henry Pyne]]. 
* In France: [[Charles Percier]], [[Adrien Dauzats]].
* In Germany: [[Ferdinand Rothbart]], [[Rudolf von Alt]], [[Eduard Gaertner]].

'''Joseph Beuys''' ({{IPA-de|ˈjoːzɛf ˈbɔʏs|lang}}; 12 May 1921 – 23 January 1986) was a German [[Fluxus]], [[happening]], and [[performance artist]] as well as a sculptor, [[installation artist]], graphic artist, [[Art theory|art theorist]], and [[pedagogue]].

His extensive work is grounded in concepts of [[humanism]], [[social philosophy]] and [[anthroposophy]]; it culminates in his "extended definition of art" and the idea of [[social sculpture]] as a [[gesamtkunstwerk]], for which he claimed a creative, participatory role in shaping [[society]] and [[politics]]. His career was characterized by open public debates on a very wide range of subjects including political, environmental, social and long term cultural trends. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential artists of the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hopper |first=Kenneth |last2=Hopper |first2=William |title=The Puritan gift: triumph, collapse, and the revival of an American dream |publisher=I.B.Tauris |year=2007 |isbn=1-85043-419-0 |page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hughes |first=Robert |title=The Shock of the New |edition=revised |publisher=Alfred A.

==Biography==

=== Childhood and early life in the Third Reich (1921–1941) ===
Joseph Beuys was born in [[Krefeld]], the son of the merchant Josef Jakob Beuys (1888–1958) and Johanna Maria Margarete Beuys (born Hülsermann, 1889–1974). The parents had moved from Geldern to [[Krefeld]] in 1910, and Beuys was born there on 12 May 1921. In autumn of that year the family moved to [[Kleve]], an industrial town in the Lower Rhine region of Germany, close to the Dutch border. There, Joseph attended primary school (''Katholische Volksschule'') and secondary school (''Staatliches Gymnasium Cleve'', now the ''Freiherr-vom-Stein-Gymnasium''). His teachers considered him to have a talent for drawing; he also took piano and cello lessons. On several occasions he visited the studio of the Flemish painter and sculptor Achilles Moortgat. Other interests include Nordic history and mythology and especially the natural sciences. According to his own account, when the [[Nazi Party]] staged their [[Nazi book burnings|book-burning]] in [[Kleve]] on 19 May 1933 in the courtyard of his school, he salvaged the book ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' by [[Carl Linnaeus]] "...from that large, flaming pile".&lt;ref name="Adriani_79"&gt;Adriani ''et al.'', 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 Beuys was a member of the [[Hitler Youth]]; the organization comprised a large majority of German children and adolescents at that time and later that year membership became compulsory. He participated in the [[Nuremberg rally]] in September 1936, when he was 15 years old.&lt;ref&gt;See Claudia Schmuckli: 'Chronology and Selected Exhibition History,' in Joseph Beuys: Actions, Vitrines, Environments (Tate, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

From an early age, Beuys displayed an interest in the natural sciences and had considered a career in medical studies, but in his last years of school–possibly influenced by pictures of [[Wilhelm Lehmbruck]]'s sculptures&lt;ref&gt;Lothar Schirmer (Hrsg.): ''Mein Dank an Lehmbruck. Eine Rede''. Schirmer/Mosel, München 2006, S. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;–he had decided to become a sculptor himself. Around 1939 he worked for a circus on the side, postering and taking care of animals for about a year.&lt;ref name="Ermen_07"&gt;Ermen 2007, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from school in the spring of 1941 with his [[Abitur]].

=== World War II (1941–1945) ===
In 1941, Beuys volunteered for the [[Luftwaffe]].&lt;ref&gt;The implications are ambiguous, Germany was at war since September 1939, military service was mandatory, and volunteering was one way to influence deployment.&lt;/ref&gt;
He began his military training as an aircraft radio operator in 1941, under the tutelage of [[Heinz Sielmann]] in Posen (now [[Poznań]]) and they both attended lectures in Biology and Zoology at the [[Adam Mickiewicz University|University of Posen]], at that time a [[Universities in the Third Reich#Germanized universities|Germanized University]]. It is also during this time that he began to seriously consider a career as an artist{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}.

In 1942, Beuys was stationed in the [[Crimea]] and was a member of various combat bomber units. From 1943 on he was deployed as rear-gunner in the [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87]] "Stuka" dive-bomber, initially stationed in [[Königgrätz]], later in the eastern [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic region]]. Drawings and sketches from that time have been preserved and already show his characteristic style.&lt;ref name="Adriani_79" /&gt; 
On 16 March 1944, Beuys's plane crashed on the [[Crimean Offensive|Crimean Front]] close to Znamianka, then Freiberg [[Krasnohvardiiske Raion]]&lt;ref&gt;http://evkol.ucoz.com/crimea_communes.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; From this incident, Beuys fashioned the myth that he was rescued from the crash by nomadic [[Crimean Tatars|Tatar tribesmen]], who had wrapped his broken body in [[animal fat]] and [[felt]] and nursed him back to health:

: "Had it not been for the Tartars I would not be alive today. They were the nomads of the Crimea, in what was then no man's land between the Russian and German fronts, and favoured neither side. I had already struck up a good relationship with them, and often wandered off to sit with them. 'Du nix njemcky' they would say, 'du Tartar,' and try to persuade me to join their clan. Their nomadic ways attracted me of course, although by that time their movements had been restricted. Yet, it was they who discovered me in the snow after the crash, when the German search parties had given up. I was still unconscious then and only came round completely after twelve days or so, and by then I was back in a German field hospital. So the memories I have of that time are images that penetrated my consciousness. The last thing I remember was that it was too late to jump, too late for the parachutes to open. That must have been a couple of seconds before hitting the ground. Luckily I was not strapped in – I always preferred free movement to safety belts… My friend was strapped in and he was atomized on impact – there was almost nothing to be found of him afterwards. But I must have shot through the windscreen as it flew back at the same speed as the plane hit the ground and that saved me, though I had bad skull and jaw injuries. Then the tail flipped over and I was completely buried in the snow. That's how the Tartars found me days later. I remember voices saying 'Voda' (Water), then the felt of their tents, and the dense pungent smell of cheese, fat and milk. They covered my body in fat to help it regenerate warmth, and wrapped it in felt as an insulator to keep warmth in."&lt;ref&gt;Beuys in Caroline Tisdall: Joseph Beuys (Guggenheim, 1979), pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Records state that Beuys was conscious, recovered by a German search commando, and there were no Tatars in the village at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eigen-art.com/Kuenstlerseiten/KuenstlerseiteJH/mappe.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020130028/http://www.eigen-art.com/Kuenstlerseiten/KuenstlerseiteJH/mappe.pdf |archivedate=20 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beuys was brought to a military hospital where he stayed for three weeks from 17 March to 7 April.&lt;ref&gt;Ermen (2007), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; It is consistent with Beuys' work that his biography would have been subject to his own reinterpretation;&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed account of the complex emergence of this powerful story, see Peter Nisbet: 'Crash Course – Remarks on a Beuys Story,' in Gene Ray (ed.): Joseph Beuys, Mapping the Legacy ([[Distributed Art Publishers]], 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; this particular story has served as a powerful myth of origins for Beuys's artistic identity, as well as providing an initial interpretive key to his use of unconventional materials, amongst which felt and fat were central.

Despite prior injuries, he was deployed to the [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Front]] in August 1944, into a poorly equipped and trained [[7th Parachute Division (Germany)|paratrooper unit]].&lt;ref name="Adriani_79" /&gt; He received the German [[Wound Badge]] in gold for being wounded in action more than five times. On the day after the [[Victory in Europe Day|German unconditional surrender]] on 8 May 1945, Beuys was taken prisoner in [[Cuxhaven]] and brought to a British [[internment camp]] from which he was released 5 August of that year. He returned to his parents who had moved to a suburb of [[Kleve]].

=== Studies and beginnings (1945–1960) ===
{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
After his return to [[Kleve]], Beuys met the local sculptor Walter Brüx and painter Hanns Lamers, who encouraged him to take up art as a full-time career. He joined the Kleve Artists Association that had been established by Brüx and Lamers. On 1 April 1946, Beuys enrolled in the "Monumental Sculpture" program at the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf|Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts]]. Initially assigned to the class of [[:de:Joseph Enseling|Joseph Enseling]], with a traditional, representational focus&lt;ref name="Adriani_79"/&gt; he successfully applied to change his mentor after three semesters and joined the small class of [[Ewald Mataré]] in 1947, who had rejoined the academy the preceding year, after having been banned by the Nazis in 1939. The anthroposophic philosophy of [[Rudolf Steiner]] became an increasingly important basis for Beuys' reasoning, in his view it is: "... an approach that refers to reality in a direct and practical way, and that by comparison, all forms of epistemological discourse remain without direct relevance to current trends and movements".&lt;ref name="Adriani_79" /&gt;&lt;!-- de 33 --&gt; Reaffirming his interest in science, Beuys re-established contact with [[Heinz Sielmann]] and assisted with a number of nature- and wildlife documentaries in the region between 1947 and 1949.

In 1947 he, with other artists including [[Hann Trier]], was a founder member of the group 'Donnerstag-Gesellschaft' (''Thursday Group'').&lt;ref name="SSJ25"&gt;Stiftung Museum Schloss Moyland, Sammlung van der Grinten, Joseph Beuys Archiv des Landes Nordrhein-Westfalen (Hrsg.): ''Joseph Beuys, Ewald Mataré and Eight Cologne Artists''. B.o.s.s Druck und Medien, Bedburg-Hau 2001, S. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The Group organised discussions, exhibitions, events and concerts between 1947 and 1950 in Alfter Castle.

In 1951, Mataré accepted Beuys into his master class.&lt;ref&gt;The German Academy of Fine Arts equivalent of graduate studies. (cf. [[:de:Meisterschüler]])&lt;/ref&gt; where he shared a studio with [[Erwin Heerich]]&lt;ref&gt;Invar Hollaus, "Heerich, Erwin". In ''Allgemeines Künstler-Lexikon'', vol. 71 (2011), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; that he kept until 1954, a year after graduation. Nobel laureate [[Günter Grass]] recollects Beuys' influence in Mataré's class as shaping "a Christian [[anthroposophic]] atmosphere".&lt;ref&gt;[[Günter Grass]], (2006) [[Peeling the Onion]] (autobiography).&lt;/ref&gt; He read [[James Joyce|Joyce]], impressed by the "Irish-mythological elements" in his works,&lt;ref name="Adriani_79" /&gt;&lt;!-- de 38 --&gt; the German [[Romanticism|romantics]] [[Novalis]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]], and studied [[Galilei]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]–whom he admired as examples of artists and scientists who are conscious of their position in society and who work accordingly.&lt;ref name="Adriani_79" /&gt; &lt;!-- de 40 --&gt; Early shows include participations in the Kleve Artists Association annual exhibition in Kleve's [[Barend Cornelis Koekkoek#Haus Koekkoek, Kleve|Villa Koekkoek]] where Beuys showed aquarelles and sketches, a solo show at the home of [[:de:Hans van der Grinten|Hans]]&lt;sup&gt;(German)&lt;/sup&gt; and [[:de:Franz Joseph van der Grinten|Franz Joseph van der Grinten]]&lt;sup&gt;(German)&lt;/sup&gt; in [[Kranenburg, North Rhine-Westphalia|Kranenburg]] and a show in the [[Von der Heydt Museum]] in [[Wuppertal]].&lt;!-- continue with van der Grinten --&gt;

Beuys finished his education in 1953, graduating as master student from Mataré's class, 32 years old at that time. He had a modest income from a number of crafts-oriented commissions: a gravestone and several pieces of furniture. &lt;!-- continue rewrite here: '56 Ausschwitz memorial, '57 depressions... --&gt; Throughout the 1950s, Beuys struggled with a dire financial situation and with the trauma of his wartime experiences. His output consisted mainly of drawings, which he produced in the thousands, but he also produced some sculptures. Through his drawing practice, Beuys explored a range of unconventional materials and developed his artistic agenda, exploring metaphorical and symbolic connections between natural phenomena and philosophical systems. Often difficult to interpret in themselves, these drawings constitute a speculative, contingent and rather hermetic exploration of the material world and how that world might be connected to the realm of myth and philosophy. In 1974, 327 drawings, the majority of which were made during the late 1940s and 1950s, were collected into a group entitled The Secret Block for a Secret Person in Ireland (a reference to Joyce), and exhibited in Oxford, Edinburgh, Dublin and Belfast.

In 1956, artistic self-doubt and material impoverishment led to a physical and psychological crisis, and Beuys entered a period of serious depression. He recovered at the house of his most important early patrons, the van der Grinten brothers, in Kranenburg. In 1958, Beuys participated in an international competition for an [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]] memorial, but his proposal did not win and his design was never realised. Also in 1958, Beuys began a cycle of drawings related to Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''. Completed in ca. 1961, the six exercise books of drawings would constitute, Beuys declared, an extension of Joyce's seminal novel. In 1959 Beuys married Eva Wurmbach. They had two children together, Wenzel (born 1961) and Jessyka (born 1964).

=== Academia and public (1960–1975) ===
In 1961, Beuys was appointed professor of 'monumental sculpture' at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. His students were artists like [[Anatol Herzfeld]], [[Katharina Sieverding]], [[Jörg Immendorff]], [[Blinky Palermo]], [[Peter Angermann]], [[Elias Maria Reti]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Walter Dahn|de}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Johannes Stüttgen|de}} Sigmar Polke and Friederike Weske.

What served to launch Beuys into the public consciousness was that which transpired following his performance at the Technical College Aachen in 1964. As part of a festival of new art coinciding with the 20th anniversary of an assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler, Beuys created a performance or Aktion. The performance was interrupted by a group of students, one of whom attacked Beuys, punching him in the face. A photograph of the artist, nose bloodied and arm raised, was circulated in the media. It was for this 1964 festival that Beuys produced an idiosyncratic [[Curriculum vitae|CV]], which he titled ''Lebenslauf/Werklauf'' (Life Course/Work Course). The document was a self-consciously fictionalised account of the artist's life, in which historical events mingle with metaphorical and mythical speech (he refers to his birth as the 'Exhibition of a wound;' he claims his Ulysses Extension to have been carried out 'at James Joyce's request' – impossible, given that the writer was, by 1961, long dead). This document marks a blurring of fact and fiction that was to be characteristic of Beuys' self-created persona, as well as the source of much controversy (although, significantly, there is no mention here of the famous plane crash).

Beuys manifested his social philosophical ideas in abolishing entry requirements to his Düsseldorf class. Throughout the late 1960s this renegade policy caused great institutional friction, which came to a head in October 1972 when Beuys was dismissed from his post. That year he found 142 applicants who had not been accepted that he wished to enroll under his teaching. 16 of them agreed and he then occupied the offices of the academy to gain a hearing about their admission. They were admitted by the school, but the relationship between Beuys and the school were irreconcilable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Durini, Lucrezia De Domizio. ''The Felt Hat: Joseph Beuys A Life Told''. Milano, Charta, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; The dismissal, which Beuys refused to accept, produced a wave of protests from students, artists and critics. Although now bereft of an institutional position, Beuys continued an intense schedule of public lectures and discussions, as well as becoming increasingly active in German politics. Despite this dismissal, the walkway on the academy's side of the Rhine bears Beuys as its namesake. Later in life, Beuys became a visiting professor at various institutions (1980–1985).

[[File:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|Joseph Beuys on his lecture "Jeder Mensch ist ein Künstler – Auf dem Weg zur Freiheitsgestalt des sozialen Organismus" photographed by {{Interlanguage link multi|Rainer Rappmann|de}} in Achberg, Germany, 1978]]
'''Teaching philosophy'''

"The most important discussion is epistemological in character," stated Beuys, demonstrating his desire for continuous intellectual exchange. Beuys attempted to apply philosophical concepts to his pedagogical practice. Beuys' Action, "How to explain pictures to a dead hare," exemplifies a performance that is especially relevant to the pedagogical field because it deals with "the difficulty of explaining things".&lt;ref&gt;Ulmer, G. (2007). Performance: Joseph Beuys in Joseph Beuys The Reader. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The artist spent three hours explaining his art to a dead hare with his head covered with honey and gold leaf and Ulmer (2007) argues not only the honey on the head but the hare itself is a model of thinking, of man embodying his ideas in forms (Ulmer, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;236). Contemporary movements such as performance art may be considered 'laboratories' for a new pedagogy since "research and experiment have replaced form as the guiding force" (Ulmer, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;233).

During an ''Artform'' interview with [[Willoughby Sharp]] in 1969, Beuys added to his famous statement – "teaching is my greatest work of art" – that "the rest is the waste product, a demonstration. If you want to express yourself you must present something tangible. But after awhile this has only the function of a historic document. Objects aren't very important any more. I want to get to the origin of matter, to the thought behind it."&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, W. (1969). Interview as quoted in Energy Plan for the Western man – Joseph Beuys in America, compiled by Carin Kuoni, Four Walls Eight Windows, New York, 1993, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Beuys saw his role of an artist as a teacher or shaman who could guide society in a new direction (Sotheby's catalog, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?lot_id=159656845|title=Sotheby's – Page Not Found|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Düsseldorf Academy of Art, Beuys did not impose his artistic style or techniques on his students; in fact, he kept much of his work and exhibitions hidden from the classroom because he wanted his students to explore their own interests, ideas, and talents.&lt;ref name="henry-moore.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henry-moore.org/hmi-journal/homepage/view-occasional-papers/beuysto-be-a-teacher-is-my-greatest-work-of-art/page-1|title=Henry Moore Institute|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beuys' actions were somewhat contradictory: while he was extremely strict about certain aspects of classroom management and instruction, such as punctuality and the need for students to take draughtsmanship classes, he encouraged his students to freely set their own artistic goals without having to prescribe to set curricula.&lt;ref name="henry-moore.org"/&gt; Another aspect of Beuys' pedagogy included open "ring discussions," where Beuys and his students discussed political and philosophical issues of the day, including the role of art, democracy, and the university in society. Some of Beuys' ideas espoused in class discussion and in his art-making included free art education for all, the discovery of creativity in everyday life, and the belief that "everyone [was] an artist."&lt;ref&gt;Beuys, J. (1975). Jeder mensch ein kunstler.&lt;/ref&gt; Beuys himself encouraged peripheral activity and all manner of expression to emerge during the course of these discussions.&lt;ref name="henry-moore.org"/&gt; While some of Beuys' students enjoyed the open discourse of the Ringgesprache, others, including Palermo and Immendorf, disapproved of the classroom disorder, anarchic characteristics, eventually rejecting his methods and philosophies altogether.&lt;ref name="henry-moore.org"/&gt;

Beuys also advocated taking art outside of the boundaries of the (art) system and to open it up to multiple possibilities bringing creativity into all areas of life. His nontraditional and anti-establishment pedagogical practice and philosophy made him the focus of much controversy and in order to battle the policy of "restricted entry" under which only a few select students were allowed to attend art classes, he deliberately allowed students to over-enroll in his courses (Anastasia Shartin),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walkerart.org|title=Walker Art Center – Contemporary Art Museum – Minneapolis|website=www.walkerart.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; true to his belief those who have something to teach and those who have something to learn should come together. According to Cornelia Lauf (1992), "in order to implement his idea, as well as a host of supporting notions encompassing cultural and political concepts, Beuys crafted a charismatic artistic persona that infused his work with mystical overtones and led him to be called "shaman" and "messianic" in the popular press."

===The artist as shaman===

Beuys had adopted [[shamanism]] not only as the presentation mode of his art but also in his own life. Although the artist as a shaman has been a trend in modern art (Picasso, Gauguin), Beuys is unusual in that respect as he integrated "his art and his life into the shaman role."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ulmer|first=Gregory|title=Applied Grammatology: Post(e)-Pedagogy from Jacques Derrida to Joseph Beuys|year=1985|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beuys believed that humanity, with its turn on rationality, was trying to eliminate "emotions" and thus eliminate a major source of energy and creativity in every individual. In his first lecture tour in America he was telling the audience that humanity was in an evolving state and that as "spiritual" beings we ought to draw on both our emotions and our thinking as they represent the total energy and creativity for every individual. Beuys described how we must seek out and energize our spirituality and link it to our thinking powers so that "our vision of the world must be extended to encompass all the invisible energies with which we have lost contact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tisdall|first=Caroline|title=Joseph Beuys|year=2010|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Halpern, John (Director) | date=April 15, 1988 | title=[Joseph Beuys / TRANSFORMER] | medium=Television sculpture | location=New York City | publisher=I.T.A.P. Pictures | url=http://www.beuysfilm.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Beuys' own words,

"So when I appear as a kind of shamanistic figure, or allude to it, I do it to stress my belief in other priorities and the need to come up with a completely different plan for working with substances. For instance, in places like universities, where everyone speaks so rationally, it is necessary for a kind of enchanter to appear."

Beuys, as he often explained in his interviews, saw and used his performative art as shamanistic and psychoanalytic techniques to both educate and heal the general public.

"It was thus a strategic stage to use the shaman's character but, subsequently, I gave scientific lectures. Also, at times, on one hand, I was a kind of modern scientific analyst, on the other hand, in the actions, I had a synthetic existence as shaman. This strategy aimed at creating in people an agitation for instigating questions rather than for conveying a complete and perfect structure. It was a kind of psychoanalysis with all the problems of energy and culture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosental|first=Norman|title=Joseph Beuys: The Secret Block for a Secret Person In Ireland|year=1999|publisher=Art Books Intl Ltd|author2=Bastian, Heiner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In that respect his art was educative as well as therapeutic – "his intention was to use these two forms of discourse and styles of knowledge as pedagogues."He used shamanistic and psychoanalytic techniques to "manipulate symbols" and affect his audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ulmer|first=Gregory|title=Applied Grammatology: Post(e)-Pedagogy from Jacques Derrida to Joseph Beuys|year=1985|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=238–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his personal life, Beuys had adopted the felt hat, the felt suit, the cane and the vest as his standard look. The imagined story of him being rescued by Tartar herdsmen maybe has an explanation in that Beuys wanted to "create" a ritualistic aspect to his look and to his adoption of materials like felt and fat. Beuys experienced a severe depression between 1955 and 1957. After he recovered, Beuys observed at the time that "his personal crisis" caused him to question everything in life and he called the incident "a shamanistic initiation." Shamanism is related to death and the shaman is the mediator between this world and the "Otherworld". He saw Death not only in the inevitability of death for people but also death in the environment and he became, through his art and his political activism, a strong critic of the environmental destruction. He said at the time,

"I don't use shamanism to refer to death, but vice versa – through shamanism, I refer to the fatal character of the times we live in. But at the same time I also point out that the fatal character of the present can be overcome in the future."

=== National and international recognition (1975–1986) ===
The only major retrospective of Beuys work to be organised in Beuys's lifetime opened at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] in New York in 1979. The exhibition has been described as a "lightning rod for American criticism," eliciting as it did some powerful and polemical responses.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Schmuckli: 'Chronology and Selected Exhibition History,' in ''Joseph Beuys: Actions, Vitrines, Environments'' (Tate, 2005), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===
Beuys died of heart failure on 23 January 1986, in [[Düsseldorf]], after a long illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/joseph-beuys/ |title=Encyclopedia of World Biography on Joseph Beuys |publisher=Bookrags.com |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Body of work==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Beuys-Piano.jpg|thumb|left|''Homogeneous Infiltration for Piano'' 1966, Georges Pompidou Center, Paris]] --&gt;
Beuys' extensive body of work principally comprises four domains: works of art in a traditional sense (painting, drawing, sculpture and installations), performance, contributions to the theory of art and academic teaching, and social- and political activities.

=== Artworks and performances ===
In 1962 Beuys befriended his Düsseldorf colleague [[Nam June Paik]], a member of the [[Fluxus]] movement. This was the beginning of what was to be a brief formal involvement with Fluxus, a loose international group of artists who championed a radical erosion of the boundaries of art, bringing aspects of creative practice outside of the institution and into the everyday. Although Beuys participated in a number of Fluxus events, it soon became clear that he viewed the implications of art's economic and institutional framework differently. Indeed, whereas Fluxus was directly inspired by the radical Dada activities emerging during the First World War, Beuys in 1964 broadcast (from Second German Television Studio) a rather different message: 'Das Schweigen von [[Marcel Duchamp]] wird überbewertet' ('The Silence of Marcel Duchamp is Overrated'). Beuys's relationship with the legacy of Duchamp and the [[Readymade]] is a central (if often unacknowledged) aspect of the controversy surrounding his practice.

On January 12, 1985 Beuys, together with [[Andy Warhol]] and the Japanese artist [[Kaii Higashiyama]], became involved in the "Global-Art-Fusion" project. This was a [[Fax art]] project, initiated by the conceptual artist Ueli Fuchser, in which a fax was sent with drawings of all three artist within 32 minutes around the world – from Düsseldorf (Germany) via New York (USA) to Tokyo (Japan), received at Vienna's Palais-Liechtenstein Museum of Modern Art. This fax was a sign of peace during the [[Cold War]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Chahil: [http://andrechahil.com/wien-1985-phaenomen-fax-art-beuys-warhol-und-higashiyama-setzen-dem-kalten-krieg-ein-zeichen ''Wien 1985: Phänomen Fax-Art.

Beuys's first solo exhibition in a private gallery opened on 26 November 1965 with one of the artist's most famous and compelling performances: ''[[How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare]]''. The artist could be viewed through the glass of the gallery's window. His face was covered in honey and gold leaf, an iron slab was attached to his boot. In his arms he cradled a dead hare, into whose ear he mumbled muffled noises as well as explanations of the drawings that lined the walls. Such materials and actions had specific symbolic value for Beuys. For example, honey is the product of bees, and for Beuys (following Rudolf Steiner), bees represented an ideal society of warmth and brotherhood. Gold had its importance within alchemical enquiry, and iron, the metal of Mars, stood for a masculine principle of strength and connection to the earth. A photograph from the performance, in which Beuys is sitting with the hare, has been described "by some critics as a new Mona Lisa of the 20th century," though Beuys disagreed with the description.

Beuys explained his performance thus: "In putting honey on my head I am clearly doing something that has to do with thinking. Human ability is not to produce honey, but to think, to produce ideas. In this way the deathlike character of thinking becomes lifelike again. For honey is undoubtedly a living substance. Human thinking can be lively too. But it can also be intellectualized to a deadly degree, and remain dead, and express its deadliness in, say, the political or pedagogic fields.
"Gold and honey indicate a transformation of the head, and therefore, naturally and logically, the brain and our understanding of thought, consciousness and all the other levels necessary to explain pictures to a hare: the warm stool insulated with felt…and the iron sole with the magnet. I had to walk on this sole when I carried the hare round from picture to picture, so along with the strange limp came the clank of iron on the hard stone floor—that was all that broke the silence, since my explanations were mute…
"This seems to have been the action that most captured people's imaginations. On one level this must be because everyone consciously or unconsciously recognizes the problem of explaining things, particularly where art and creative work are concerned, or anything that involves a certain mystery or question. The idea of explaining to an animal conveys a sense of the secrecy of the world and of existence that appeals to the imagination. Then, as I said, even a dead animal preserves more powers of intuition than some human beings with their stubborn rationality.
"The problem lies in the word 'understanding' and its many levels which cannot be restricted to rational analysis. Imagination, inspiration, and longing all lead people to sense that these other levels also play a part in understanding. This must be the root of reactions to this action, and is why my technique has been to try and seek out the energy points in the human power field, rather than demanding specific knowledge or reactions on the part of the public. I try to bring to light the complexity of creative areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title= Marina Abramovic | author=Robert Ayers | publisher=ARTINFO | date= 9 November 2005 | url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/1537/marina-abramovic/ | accessdate=2008-04-22 | postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beuys produced many such spectacular, ritualistic performances, and he developed a compelling persona whereby he took on a liminal, shamanistic role, as if to enable passage between different physical and spiritual states. Further examples of such performances include: [[Eurasia|''EURASIA'']] (1965), Celtic (Kinloch Rannoch) Scottish Symphony (1970), and ''I Like America and America Likes Me'' (1974).

===''The Chief'' (performance, installation, 1964)===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
In the basement of the floor of the Rene Block Gallery in Berlin, Beuys positioned himself on the floor wrapped in a large felt blanket. Emerging from either end of the blanket were two dead hares, often seen in his performances. Around him was an installation of copper rod, felt and fat. Inside a blanket he held a microphone and for a period of eight hours grunted into the microphone as viewers watched from the doorway. The grunts are compared to those of a stag, as the stag is a symbol of something like a chief. The performance directly relates and even includes elements of the Fluxus movement that Beuys was a part of. The grunting is seen in part of a composition as a reflection of suffering. Being wrapped in a felt blanket mirrors the story of his suffering and rescue by the Tartars after his plane crashed in the war.

===''Infiltration Homogen for Piano'' (performance, 1966)===

In 1966 Beuys presented with piece as a performance. He had made one object,  a piano covered entirely in felt with a red cross on its side. The piano could not be played and no sound would ever be heard from beneath the felt. Beuys remarks that the piano will always hold the potential for sound. The red cross is a symbol for the danger that people face when we remain silent. When he presented this work he also used a black board to draw and write on. Beuys often uses this medium to create discussion and memory. What is not often included in the documentation of this piece is the subtitle that Beuys included: "The Greatest Composer here is the Thalidomide Child.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Thalidomide was a sleep aid introduced in the 1950s to Germany and then across the west. It was soon found that it aided in morning sickness and was prescribed in unlimited doses to pregnant women. It was quickly apparent that Thalidomide was causing deformities in the children of mothers who had taken the drug. It was on the market for less than four years. In Germany around 2,500 children were affected. During his performance Beuys held a discussion about the Thalidomide child as the greatest composer and the division of the cross.

===''I Like America and America Likes Me'' (performance, 1974)===
&lt;!-- Please fix incoming redirects to this section if you change the section title. Thanks! --&gt;
Art historian Uwe Schneede considers this performance pivotal for the reception of German [[avant-garde]] art in the United States, as it paved the way for the recognition of Beuys' own work, but also that of contemporaries such as [[Markus Lüpertz|Lüpertz]], [[Georg Baselitz|Baselitz]], [[Anselm Kiefer|Kiefer]] and many others in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Schneede"&gt;Schneede, 1998, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1974 Beuys flew to New York and was taken by ambulance to the site of the performance, a room in the René Block Gallery at 409 West Broadway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johanhedback.com/beuys.html|title=American Beuys|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316063227/http://johanhedback.com/beuys.html|archivedate=16 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beuys lay on the ambulance stretcher swathed in felt. He shared this room with a [[coyote]], for eight hours over three days. At times he stood, wrapped in a thick, grey blanket of felt, leaning on a large shepherd's staff. At times he lay on the straw, at times he watched the coyote as the coyote watched him and cautiously circled the man, or shredded the blanket to pieces, and at times he engaged in symbolic gestures, such as striking a large triangle or tossing his leather gloves to the animal; the performance continuously shifted between elements that were required by the realities of the situation, and elements that had a purely symbolic character. At the end of the three days, Beuys hugged the coyote that had grown quite tolerant of him, and was taken to the airport. Again he rode in a veiled ambulance, leaving America without having set foot on its ground. As Beuys later explained: 'I wanted to isolate myself, insulate myself, see nothing of America other than the coyote.'&lt;ref name="Schneede" /&gt;

===''Celtic (Kinloch Rannoch) Scottish Symphony'', ''Celtic+'', ''Agnus Vitex Castus'' and ''Three Pots for The Poorhouse'' (performances 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973)===

Richard Demarco invited Beuys to Scotland in May 1970 and again in August to show and perform in the Edinburgh International Festival with Gunther Uecker, Blinky Palermo and other Duesseldorf artists plus Robert Filliou&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eca.ac.uk/palermo/history_strategy_get_arts.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727223624/http://www.eca.ac.uk/palermo/history_strategy_get_arts.htm |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where they took over the main spaces of Edinburgh College of Art. The exhibition was one of the defining moments for British and European Art, directly influencing several generations of artists and curators.

In Edinburgh 1970 Beuys created ARENA for Demarco as a retrospective of his art up to that time, and he showed The Pack and performed Celtic Kinloch Rannoch with Henning Christiansen and Johannes Stuttgen in support, seen by several thousands. This was Beuys's first use of blackboards and the beginning of nine trips to Scotland to work with Richard Demarco, and six to Ireland and five to England working mainly with art critic Caroline Tisdall and Troubled Image Group artist Robert McDowell and others in the detailed formulation of the Free International University for Creativity and Interdisciplinary Research that was presented iat Dokumenta 6 in 1977, in London in 1978 and Edinburgh in 1980 as well as many other iterations.

In Edinburgh, at the end of the 1970s the FIU became one of four organisations that together founded the German Green Party. Beuys became entranced by the periphery of Europe as a dynamic counter in culture and economy terms to Europe's centralisation and this included linking Europe's energies North-South to Italy and East West in the Eurasia concept, with special emphasis on Celtic traditions in landscape, poetry, myths that also define Eurasia. In his view anything that survives as art and ideas and beliefs including the great religions for centuries or millennia contain eternal truths and beauty. The truth of ideas and of 'thinking as form', the sculpture of energies across a wide and variegated spectrum from mythos and spirituality to materialism, Socialism and Capitalism, and of 'creativity = capital' encompassed for him the study of geology, botany, and animal life and finding meanings and precepts in all of these as much as in the study of society. philosophy and he human condition and in his art practice as 'Social Sculpture'.

He adopted and developed a gestalt way of examining and working with both organic and inorganic substances and human social elements, following Leonardo, Loyola, Goethe, Steiner, Joyce, and many other artists and, scientists and thinkers, working with all visible and invisible aspects comprising a totality of cultural, moral and ethical significance as much as practical or scientific value. These trips inspired many works and performances. Beuys considered Edinburgh with its Enlightenment history as a laboratory of inspirational ideas. It was when visiting Loch Awe and Rannoch Moor on his May 1970 visit to Demarco he first conceived the necessity of the ''7,000 Oaks'' work. After making the Loch Awe sculpture, at Rannoch Moor he began what became the ''Celtic (Kinlock Rannoch) Scottish Symphony'' performance, developed further in Basel the next year as ''Celtic+''. The performance in Edinburgh includes his first blackboard that later appears in many performances when in discussions with the public. With it and his Eurasian staff he is a transmitter and despite long periods of imperturbable stillness interspersed by Christiansen's 'sound sculptures' he also creates dialogue evoking artists thoughts and in discussion with spectators. He collected gelatin representing crystalline stored energy of ideas that had been spread over the wall. In Basel the action including washing the feet of seven spectators. He immersed himself in water with reference to Christian traditions and baptism and symbolized revolutionary freedom from false preconceptions.

He then as in Edinburgh pushed a blackboard across the floor alternately writing or drawing on it for his audience.  He put each piece in a tray and as the tray became full he held it above his head and convulsed causing the gelatin to fall on him and the floor. He followed this with a quiet pause. He stared into emptiness for over half an hour, fairly still in both performances. During this time he had a lance in his hand and was standing by the blackboard where he had drawn a grail. His stance was a protective one. After this he repeated each action in the opposite order ending with the washing with water as a final cleansing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The performances were filled with Celtic symbolism with various interpretation or historical influences. This extended in 1972 with the performance ''Vitex Agnus Castus'' in Naples of combining female and male elements and evoking much else and that extended further with ''I Like America and America Likes Me'' to have a performance dialogue with the original energy of America represented by the endangered yet highly intelligent coyote.

In 1973, in Edinburgh, Beuys worked with Buckminster Fuller in Demarco's 'Black &amp; White Oil Conference, where Beuys talked of 'The Energy Plan of the Western Man' using blackboards in open discussion with audiences at Demarco's Forrest Hill Schoolhouse. In the 1974 Edinburgh Festival, Beuys performed ''Three Pots for the Poorhouse'' again using gelatin in Edinburgh's ancient poorhouse, continuing the development begun with Celtic Kinloch Rannoch. He met there Tadeusz Kantor directing ''Lovelies and Dowdies'' and was at Marina Abramovitz's first ever performance. In 1976, Beuys performed ''In Defence of the Innocent'' at the Demarco Gallery where he stood for the imprisoned gangster and sculptor Jimmy Boyle in a manner associating Boyle with The Coyote. In 1980 Edinburgh Festival Beuys was at the FIU exhibition and performed ''Jimmy Boyle Days'' (the name of the blackboards he used in public discussions), and where he went on temporary hunger strike as a public protest and led with others in a legal action against the Scottish Justice system. This was the first case under the new European Human Rights Act. These eight performances should be understood as one continuum.

=== The concept of "Social Sculpture" ===
[[File:7thousand oaks.jpg|thumb|upright|Some of the [[7000 Oaks|''7,000 Oaks'']] planted between 1982 and 1987 for Documenta 7 (1982)]]
It was during the 1960s that Beuys formulated his central theoretical concepts concerning the social, cultural and political function and potential of art.&lt;ref&gt;Oman, Hiltrud (1998). Die Kunst auf dem Weg zum Leben: Joseph Beuys. Heyne TB.&lt;/ref&gt; Indebted to Romantic writers such as [[Novalis]] and Schiller, Beuys was motivated by a belief in the power of universal human creativity and was confident in the potential for art to bring about revolutionary change. These ideas were founded in the body of social ideas of [[Rudolf Steiner]] known as [[Social Threefolding]], of which he was a vigorous and original proponent. This translated into Beuys's formulation of the concept of [[social sculpture]], in which society as a whole was to be regarded as one great work of art (the Wagnerian Gesamtkunstwerk) to which each person can contribute creatively (perhaps Beuys's most famous phrase, borrowed from Novalis, is 'Everyone is an artist'). In the video "Willoughby SHARP,'' Joseph Beuys, Public Dialogues'' (1974/120 min)", a record of Beuy's first major public discussion in the U.S., Beuys elaborates three principles: Freedom, Democracy, and Socialism, saying that each of them depends on the other two in order to be meaningful. In 1973, Beuys wrote:

: "Only on condition of a radical widening of definitions will it be possible for art and activities related to art [to] provide evidence that art is now the only evolutionary-revolutionary power. Only art is capable of dismantling the repressive effects of a senile social system that continues to totter along the deathline: to dismantle in order to build 'A SOCIAL ORGANISM AS A WORK OF ART'… EVERY HUMAN BEING IS AN ARTIST who – from his state of freedom – the position of freedom that he experiences at first-hand – learns to determine the other positions of the TOTAL ART WORK OF THE FUTURE SOCIAL ORDER."&lt;ref&gt;Beuys statement dated 1973, first published in English in Caroline Tisdall: Art into Society, Society into Art (ICA, London, 1974), p.48. Capitals in original.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 he was invited to create a work for [[Documenta]] 7. He delivered a large pile of basalt stones. From above one could see that the pile of stones was a large arrow pointing to a single oak tree that he had planted. He announced that the stones should not be moved unless an oak tree was planted in the new location of the stone. [[7000 Oaks|7,000 oak trees]] were then planted in Kassel, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Reames, ''Arborsculpture: Solutions for a Small Planet'', 2005, p. 42, {{ISBN|0-9647280-8-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This project exemplified the idea that a [[social sculpture]] was defined as interdisciplinary and participatory. Beuys's wanted to effect environmental and social change through this project. The [[Dia Art Foundation]] continues his project still and has planted more trees and paired them with basalt stones too.
Beuys said that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
My point with these seven thousand trees was that each would be a monument, consisting of a living part, the live tree, changing all the time, and a crystalline mass, maintaining its shape, size, and weight. This stone can be transformed only by taking from it, when a piece splinters off, say, never by growing. By placing these two objects side by side, the proportionality of the monument's two parts will never be the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diaart.org/sites/page/51/1295 |title=Dia Art Foundation – Sites |publisher=Diaart.org |accessdate=2013-03-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518075016/http://www.diaart.org/sites/page/51/1295 |archivedate=18 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== "Sonne Statt Reagan" ===
In 1982, Beuys recorded a music video for a song he had written entitled "Sonne statt Reagan"&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|DQ1_ALxGbGk}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates to "Sun, not Rain/Reagan" This was an anti-Reagan political piece that included some clever puns in German and continued to reinforce some of the key messages of Beuys' career—namely an extremely liberal, pacifist political attitude; a desire to perpetuate open discourse on art and politics; a refusal to sanctify his own image and 'artistic reputation' by only doing the kinds of work other people expected he would do; and above all an openness to exploring different media forms to get across the messages he wanted to convey. His continued commitment to the demystification and dis-institutionalization of the 'art world' was never more clear than it is here.

Beuys made it clear that he considered this song as a work of art, not the "pop" product it appears to be, which is apparent from the moment one views it. Such becomes more obvious when one looks at the lyrics, which are aimed directly at Reagan, the military complex and whoever is trying to defrost the "Cold War" to make it "hot." The song has to be understood in the context of intense liberal and progressive frustration in 1982. Beuys warns Reagan ''et al.'' that the peace-loving masses are behind him, and that includes the Americans as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fluter.de/de/protest/musik/6244/|title=Pop statt Böller – Joseph Beuys: Sonne statt Reagan – Musik – fluter.de|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130211024105/http://www.fluter.de/de/protest/musik/6244/|archivedate=11 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work has been avoided in some discourse on Beuys because he has been put in artistically sacrosanct position and this is not in conformance with Beuys' other work. In choosing to do a piece in the form of popular music, Beuys demonstrated a commitment to his views and the most expansive ways of having them reach people. While it is easy to resist and ridicule Beuys' efforts in the pop arena, it does not change the fact that this is an important part of his collected works that needs to be acknowledged to better understand his scope, intention and own views of art.

=== ''7000 Oaks'' ===
{{Main|7000 Oaks}}
One of Beuys' more famous and ambitious pieces of social sculpture was the ''7000 Oaks'' project. The project was of enormous scope, and met with some controversy.

=== Political activities ===
Amongst other things, Beuys founded (or co-founded) the following political organisations: German Student Party (1967), Organization for Direct Democracy Through Referendum (1971), [[Free International University]] for Creativity and Interdisciplinary Research (1974), and German Green Party [[Alliance '90/The Greens|Die Grünen]] (1980). Beuys became a pacifist, was a vocal opponent of nuclear weapons and campaigned strenuously for environmental causes (indeed, he was elected a Green Party candidate for the European Parliament). Some of Beuys's art dealt explicitly with the issues at play in the political groups with which he was affiliated. His song and music video "Sun Instead of Reagan!" (1982) manifests the theme of regeneration (optimism, growth, hope) that runs through his life and work as well as his interest in contemporary nuclear politics: "But we want: sun instead of Reagan, to live without weapons! Whether West, whether East, let missiles rust!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beuys|title=Sun Instead of Reagan|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ1_ALxGbGk&amp;feature=player_embedded|publisher=Youtube|accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critiques==
One thing that the Guggenheim retrospective and its catalogue did was to afford an American critical audience a comprehensive view of Beuys's practice and rhetoric. Whereas Beuys had been a central figure in the post-war European artistic consciousness for some time, American audiences had previously only had partial and fleeting access to his work. In 1980, and building on the scepticism voiced by Belgian artist [[Marcel Broodthaers]], who in 1972 Open Letter had compared Beuys to Wagner,&lt;ref&gt;Published in Reinische Post on 3 October 1972, written by Broodthaers on 25 September 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; art historian [[Benjamin Buchloh]] (who was teaching at Staatliche Kunstakademie, just like Beuys) launched a polemically forceful attack on Beuys.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin H.D. Buchloh: 'Beuys: The Twilight of the Idol,' Artforum, vol.5, no.18 (January 1980), pp. 35–43.&lt;/ref&gt; The essay was (and remains) the most vitriolic and thoroughgoing critique of both Beuys's rhetoric (referred to as "simple-minded utopian drivel") and persona (Buchloh regards Beuys as both infantile and messianic).&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin H.D. Buchloh: 'Beuys: The Twilight of the Idol,' ''Artforum'', vol.5, no.18 (January 1980), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Firstly, Buchloh draws attention to Beuys's fictionalisation of his own biography,&lt;ref&gt;While correctly pointing out the fictionalisation, Buchloh mistakenly identifies the plane crash as having entered Beuys' biography as early as his 1964 Lebenslauf/Werklauf.&lt;/ref&gt; which he sees as symptomatic of a dangerous cultural tendency of disavowing a traumatic past and retreating into the realms of myth and esoteric symbolism. Buchloh attacks Beuys for his failure to acknowledge and engage with Nazism, the Holocaust, and their implications. Secondly, Buchloh criticizes Beuys for displaying an inability or reluctance to engage with the consequences of the work of [[Marcel Duchamp]]. That is, a failure to acknowledge the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing function]] of the art institution and the inevitable dependence upon such institutions to create meaning for art objects. If Beuys championed art's power to foster political transformation, he nevertheless failed to acknowledge the limits imposed upon such aspirations by the art museum and dealership networks that served somewhat less utopian ambitions. For Buchloh, rather than acknowledging the collective and contextual formation of meaning, Beuys instead attempted to prescribe and control the meanings of his art, and often in the form of dubious esoteric or symbolic codings. Buchloh's critique has been developed by a number of commentators such as Stefan Germer and Rosalind Krauss.&lt;ref&gt;Germer: 'Haacke, Broodthaers, Beuys,' October 45, Summer 1989, pp. 63–75. Krauss: 'No to… Joseph Beuys,' in Krauss and Bois: ''Formless: A User's Guide'' (Zone, 1997), 143-146.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rehabilitation===
Buchloh's critique has been subject to revision. His attention is given to dismantling a mythologized artistic persona and utopian rhetoric, which he regarded to be irresponsible and even (it is implied) proto-fascist. Since Buchloh's essay was written, however, a great deal of new archival material has come to light. Most significantly, Beuys's proposal for an Auschwitz-Birkenau memorial, submitted in 1958. It has been claimed that the existence of such a project invalidates Buchloh's claim that Beuys retreated from engaging with the Nazi legacy, a point that Buchloh himself has recently acknowledged, although the charges of romanticism and self-mythologizing remain.&lt;ref&gt;Buchloh: 'Reconsidering Joseph Beuys, Once Again,' in Gene Ray (ed.): Joseph Beuys, Mapping the Legacy ([[Distributed Art Publishers]], 2001), pp. 75–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beuys's charisma and eclecticism have polarised his audience. Beuys has attracted a huge number of admirers and devotees, the tendency of whom has been to uncritically accept Beuys's own explanations as interpretive solutions to his work. In contrast, there are those who, following Buchloh, are relentlessly critical of Beuys's rhetoric and use weaknesses in his argumentation to dismiss his work as bogus. Relatively few accounts have been concerned with an encounter with the works themselves, with exceptions arriving in the scholarship of art historians such as Gene Ray, Claudia Mesch, [[Christa-Maria Lerm Hayes]], Briony Fer, Alex Potts, and others. The drive here has been to wrest the potential of Beuys's work away from the artist's own rhetoric, and to further explore both the wider discursive formations within which Beuys operated (this time, productively), and the specific material properties of the works themselves.&lt;ref&gt;See, amongst other relevant publications: Ray: 'Joseph Beuys and the After-Auschwitz Sublime,' in Gene Ray (ed.): Joseph Beuys, Mapping the Legacy ([[Distributed Art Publishers]], 2001), pp. 55–74; Mesch, "Sculpture in Fog: Beuys' Vitrines," in John Welchman, ed., Sculpture and Vitrine (Ashgate and The Henry Moore Institute, 2013), 121-142; Lerm Hayes: Joyce in Art, Visual Art Inspired by James Joyce (Lilliput Press, 2004); Fer: The Infinite Line: Remaking Art After Modernism (Yale, 2004); Potts: 'Tactility: The Interrogation of Medium in the Art of the 1960s,' Art History, Vol.27, No.2 April 2004. 282-304.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of contemporary artists who have drawn from the legacy of Beuys include [[AA Bronson]], former member of the artists' collaborative [[General Idea]], who, not without irony, adopts the subject position of the shaman to reclaim art's restorative, healing powers; [[Andy Wear (artist)|Andy Wear]] whose installations are deliberately formed according to the Beuysian notion of 'stations' and are (in particular, referencing the Block Beuys in Darmstadt) essentially a constellation of works performed or created externally to the installation; and [[Peter Gallo]], whose drawing cycle "I wish I could draw like Joseph Beuys" features stretches of Beuys's writings combined with images traced from vintage gay pornography onto found pieces of paper.

Additionally the counter-institution of the FIU or Free International University, initiated by Beuys, continues as a publishing concern (FIU Verlag) and has active chapters in various German cities including Hamburg, Munich, and Amorbach.

Franz Joseph and Hans van der Grinten organized Beuys' first solo show at their house in Kranenburg in 1953. The Alfred Schmela Galerie was the first commercial gallery to hold a Beuys solo exhibition in 1965. Beuys participated for the first time in Documenta in Kassel in 1964. In 1969, he was included in [[Harald Szeemann]]'s groundbreaking exhibition ''When Attitudes Become Form'' at the [[Kunsthalle Bern]].

The 1970s were marked by numerous major exhibitions throughout Europe and the United States. In 1970 a large collection of Beuys' work formed under the artist's own aegis, the Ströher Collection, was installed in the [[Hessisches Landesmuseum]] in Darmstadt, which remains the most important public collection of his work. [[Pontus Hultén]] invited him to exhibit at [[Moderna Museet]] in 1971. Beuys exhibited and performed at each Documenta Kassel most notably with ''The Honeypump at the FIU Workplace'' in 1977 and with ''7,000 Oaks'' in 1982. He showed four times at the Edinburgh International Festival and represented Germany at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1976 and 1980. A retrospective of his work was held at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York, in 1979. In 1984, Beuys visited Japan and showed various works, including installations and performances, while also holding discussions with students and giving lectures. His first Beuys exhibition took place at the [[Seibu Museum of Art]] in Tokyo that same year. The DIA Art Foundation held exhibitions of Beuys's work in 1987, 1992, and 1998, and has planted trees and basalt columns in New York City as part of his 7000 Eichen, echoing his planting of 7,000 oaks each with a basalt stone project begun in 1982 for Documenta 7 in Kassel, Germany.  Large collections of his multiples are held by Harvard University, Walker Art Center Minneapolis, and Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, which also has a collection of Beuys vitrines, The Schellmann and D'Offey collections. Most of the Marx collection of Beuys works including ''The secret Block for a Secret Person in Ireland'' drawings is at The Hamburger Bahnhof Museum, Berlin. All the major art museums in Germany have many Beuys works including Fond III at Landesmuseum Darmstadt, ehil Moechengladbach Museum has the Poor House Doors and much else, Beuys gave a large collection to the Solidarinosc Movement in Poland. Feuerstätte I und Feuerstätte II (Hearth I and Hearth II) and other works are at the Museum for Contemporary Art Basel, and a dedicated museum was created for 'The Museum des Geldes' collection mainly of FIU blackboards from Documenta 6. Every year there continue to be several hundred Joseph Beuys exhibitions around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diaart.org/exhibitions/artistbio/77 Joseph Beuys – Artist Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122133836/http://diaart.org/exhibitions/artistbio/77 |date=22 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art market==
The first works Franz Joseph and Hans van der Grinten bought from Joseph Beuys in 1951 cost what would be equivalent today to €10 each. Beginning with small woodcuts, they purchased about 4,000 works and created what is now the largest Beuys collection in the world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119999526879881729 Why&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, the 'Beuys Block', a group of first works, was purchased by the collector Karl Ströher in Darmstadt (now part of the Hessisches Landesmuseum).

Since his death, Beuys' artworks have fluctuated in price, sometimes not even selling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Art Sales |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/artsales/9238209/Art-market-news-Joseph-Beuys-suit-sells-for-96000.html |title=Art market news: Joseph Beuys suit sells for $96,000 |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At auction, the top price paid for a Beuys work is $900,000 (hammer price) for a bronze sculpture titled ''Bett'' (''Corsett,'' 1949/50) at [[Sotheby's|Sotheby's New York]] in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Welcome, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; |url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/catalogues/ecatalogue.html/2008/contemporary-art-evening-auction-n08441#/r=/en/ecat.fhtml.N08441.html+r.m=/en/ecat.lot.N08441.html/34/ |title=Sotheby's – Catalogue |publisher=Sothebys.com |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Schlitten'' (''Sled'', 1969) sold for $314,500 at [[Phillips de Pury &amp; Company]], New York, in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Beuys |url=http://www.phillipsdepury.com/auctions/lot-detail/JOSEPH-BEUYS/NY030112/95/8/1/12/detail.aspx |title=P H I L L I P S : Evening Editions, JOSEPH BEUYS, Sled |publisher=Phillipsdepury.com |date=2012-09-19 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same auction, a ''Filzanzug'' (''Felt Suit,'' 1970) sold for $96,100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/artsales/9238209/Art-market-news-Joseph-Beuys-suit-sells-for-96000.html|title=Art market news: Joseph Beuys suit sells for $96,000|date=1 May 2012|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This surpassed the previous auction record for a ''Filzanzug'', 62,000 euros ($91,381.80 USD) at Kunsthaus Lempertz ([[Cologne|Cologne, Germany]]) in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aALBGYnmjwG8|title=Phibro's Andrew Hall Exhibits Beuys; Blind Men Use Power Tools|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist produced slightly more than 600 original multiples in his lifetime. Large sets of multiples are in the collections of the [[Pinakothek der Moderne]] in Munich, Germany, [[Harvard University Art Museums]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the [[Walker Art Center]] in Minneapolis, and the [[Kunstmuseum Bonn]], Germany. In 2006, the [[Eli Broad|Broad Art Foundation]] in Los Angeles acquired 570 multiples by Beuys, including a ''Filzanzug'' and a ''Schlitten'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aRoqEfAzefaI&amp;refer=culture|title=Eli Broad's Foundation Buys 570 Works by German Artist Beuys|publisher=|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby becoming the most complete collection of Beuys works in the United States and one of the largest collections of Beuys multiples in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://art-for-a-change.com/blog/2007/03/lacma-broad-beuys-bp.html |title=» LACMA: Broad, Beuys, &amp; BP |publisher=Art-for-a-change.com |date=2007-03-28 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''LSD art''' is any [[art]] or visual displays inspired by [[psychedelic experiences]] and [[hallucination]]s known to follow the ingestion of [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] (lysergic acid diethylamide, which also often colloquially known as "acid" or "azid")&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmid|first=Yasmin|last2=Enzler|first2=Florian|last3=Gasser|first3=Peter|last4=Grouzmann|first4=Eric|last5=Preller|first5=Katrin H.|last6=Vollenweider|first6=Franz X.|last7=Brenneisen|first7=Rudolf|last8=Müller|first8=Felix|last9=Borgwardt|first9=Stefan|date=2015-10-15|title=Acute Effects of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide in Healthy Subjects|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0006322314009093|journal=Biological Psychiatry|language=English|volume=78|issue=8|pages=544–553|doi=10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.11.015|issn=0006-3223}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Artists and scientists have been interested in the effect of LSD on drawing and painting since it first became available for legal use and general consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=LSD — The Problem-Solving Psychedelic |author=P.G. Stafford and B.H. Golightly |url=http://www.psychedelic-library.org/staf3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LSD causes visual hallucinations, audiovisual synaesthesia, and experiences of de-realisation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When these effects are mixed with an artist, they often illustrate their hallucinations.

== History ==
[[File:Lsdfacecoloured.jpg|thumb|left|A drawing of a face, made under the effects of LSD. [[Dr. Oscar Janiger]] noted similarities between paintings made under the influence of the drug and those made by schizophrenics.]]
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Henri Michaux.jpg|thumb|252x252px|[[Henri Michaux]]]] --&gt;
LSD art dates back to the 1960s, where it became very common as well.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reset.me/story/reflections-direct-influence-psychedelics-art/|title=Reflections On The Direct Influence Of Psychedelics On Art - Reset.me|website=Reset.me|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drug became so popular, that some countries started banning the substance in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drugfreeworld.org/drugfacts/lsd/a-short-history.html|title=The History of LSD - Acid, Albert Hoffman &amp; Timothy Leary - Drug-Free World|website=www.drugfreeworld.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A French artist by the name of [[Henri Michaux]], was considered “a pioneer in psychedelic art”. Michaux experimented with LSD while creating his now famous book, 'Miserable Miracle', which included both his writings and drawings.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many artists realised how LSD could also positively influence their artwork, which is why it was so popular throughout the 1960s.

[[Dr. Oscar Janiger]] was one of the pioneers in the field studying the relationship between LSD and [[creativity]].&lt;ref name="Jay-2003" /&gt; What fascinated Janiger was that "paintings, under the influence of LSD, had some of the attributes of what looked like the work done by schizophrenics".&lt;ref name="Jay-2003"&gt;{{cite book |title=Oscar Janiger |author=David Jay |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janiger maintained that trained artists could "maintain a certain balance, riding the edge" of the LSD induced psychosis, "ride his creative [[Pegasus]]".&lt;ref name="Jay-2003"/&gt; Janiger coined the term '"dry [[schizophrenia]]," where a person was able to control the surroundings and yet be "crazy" at the same time'.&lt;ref name="Jay-2003"/&gt;

Many artists and their surviving relatives have kept LSD artwork from this period. One patient of Dr. Janiger, [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]] and [[alcoholic]] artist Frank Murdoch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Looking For Frank Murdoch: The LSD Experiments |author=Lynn Svensson |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was given a controlled, experimental dose of LSD for several months as an attempt to cure his late stage alcoholism. Janiger had Murdoch paint still-lives both on and off LSD, including a [[Kachina]] doll (that he reportedly had 70 other patients also paint).{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Murdoch also continued to paint as an artist while on LSD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Looking For Frank Murdoch: LSD pages |author=Lynn Svensson |year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; including most of his underwater paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frankmurdoch.net/quietplace.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212013117/http://frankmurdoch.net/quietplace.aspx |archivedate=2010-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, Dr. [[Stanislav Grof]] practiced "LSD Psychotherapy" in the 1980s, which included having his patients paint on LSD. Some of his artist patients painted numerous paintings while on LSD.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Tripscapes: LSD Art From Stan Grof's Psychedelic Epic – LSD Psychotherapy |author=Stanislav Grof |year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction]] (previously called '''Women's Prize for Fiction''' (2013), '''Orange Prize for Fiction''' (1996–2006 &amp; 2009–12) and '''Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction''' (2007–2008) and to be presented as the '''Women's Prize for Fiction''' once again from 2018) is one of the United Kingdom's most prestigious literary prizes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7137156.stm|title = Life after Orange Prize success|accessdate=7 June 2009|date=28 December 2007|last=Pryor|first=Fiona|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smallisland&gt;{{cite news |url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1499760/Small-Island-voted-best-Orange-prize-winner-of-past-decade.html |title = Small Island voted best Orange prize winner of past decade|accessdate=7 June 2009|date=12 April 2008|last=Reynolds|first=Nigel|work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/11/orangeprizeforfiction2005.orangeprizeforfiction|title = Stranger than fiction|accessdate=7 June 2009 |date=11 June 2005|last=Forna|first=Aminatta|work=The Guardian  | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; annually awarded to a female author of any nationality for the best original full-length novel written in English, and published in the United Kingdom in the preceding year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-entry-rules-obpf |title=Entry rules and regulations |accessdate=7 June 2009 |publisher=Orange |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427160248/http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-entry-rules-obpf |archivedate=27 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prize was originally due to be launched in 1994 with the support of [[Mitsubishi]] but public controversy over the merits of the award caused the sponsorship to be withdrawn.&lt;ref name=womenstudies/&gt;  Funding from [[Orange (UK)|Orange]], a UK [[mobile network operator]] and [[Internet service provider]], allowed the prize to be launched in 1996 by a committee of male and female "journalists, reviewers, agents, publishers, librarians, booksellers", including current Honorary Director [[Kate Mosse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-history |publisher=Orange |accessdate=17 June 2009 |title=Prize history |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425143335/http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-history |archivedate=25 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/book_reviews/article4263530.ece | title = The Times Summer Books: Stories by Kate Mosse| accessdate =7 June 2009 |work=The Times |date=3 July 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2012, it was announced that Orange would be ending its sponsorship of the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/orange-cease-sponsorship-fiction-prize.html |title=Orange to cease sponsorship of Fiction Prize |date=22 May 2012 |accessdate=23 May 2012 |author=Benedicte Page |work=The Bookseller}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the award was formally known as the "Women's Prize for Fiction", and was sponsored by "private benefactors" led by [[Cherie Blair]] and writers [[Joanna Trollope]] and [[Elizabeth Buchan]].&lt;ref name=mccrum&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/13/orange-prize-wfp-books?newsfeed=true |title=How prize that used to be Orange was saved – and rebranded |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Robert McCrum |date=13 October 2012 |accessdate=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the new sponsor became [[Baileys]].&lt;ref name=masters/&gt; In January 2017 the company announced that it was the last year that they would sponsor the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's Prize for Fiction: Baileys end sponsorship|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-38768553|website=BBC News|accessdate=30 January 2017|date=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017, the prize announced it would change its name to simply "Women's Prize for Fiction" starting in 2018, and will be supported by a family of sponsors.&lt;ref name=newname2017/&gt;

The prize was established to recognise the contribution of female writers, whom Mosse believed were often overlooked in other major literary awards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-why-only-open-to-women |title=Why are the Orange Prize for Fiction and Award for New Writers only open to women? |publisher=Orange |accessdate=10 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106132247/http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-why-only-open-to-women |archivedate=6 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/oct/28/fiction.stephaniemerritt|work=The Guardian |title = The model of a modern writer|first=Stephanie|last=Merritt|accessdate=10 June 2009|date=28 October 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in reaction to the all-male shortlist for the 1991 [[Booker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/20/news|title = Orange Prize longlist announced|work=The Guardian |accessdate=11 June 2009|date=20 March 2000 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The winner of the prize receives [[Pound sterling|£]]30,000, along with a [[bronze sculpture]] called the ''Bessie'' created by artist [[Grizel Niven]], the sister of actor and writer [[David Niven]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-what-do-winners-win |title=What do winners win? |publisher=Orange |accessdate=7 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321050619/http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-what-do-winners-win |archivedate=21 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, a longlist of nominees is announced around March each year, followed by a shortlist in June;  within days the winner is announced.  The winner is selected by a board of "five leading women" each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-who-judges |title=Who judges the Prize for Fiction and Award for New Writers? |publisher=Orange |accessdate=7 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321050402/http://www.orangeprize.co.uk/show/feature/orange-faq-who-judges |archivedate=21 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, judges named [[Andrea Levy]]'s ''[[Small Island (novel)|Small Island]]'' as the "Orange of Oranges", the best novel of the preceding decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/oct/03/orangeprizeforfiction2005.books | title= Orange judges to name best novelist of decade |work=The Guardian  | accessdate=8 June 2009 | date=3 October 2005|first=John | last=Ezard | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[BBC]] suggests that the prize forms part of the "trinity" of UK literary prizes, along with the Booker Prize and the [[Costa Book Awards]];  the sales of works by the nominees of these awards are significantly boosted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7046677.stm| title = 10 ways to get you to read a book |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=11 June 2009|date=16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Levy's 2004 winning book sold almost one million copies (in comparison to less than 600,000 for the Booker Prize winner of the same year),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4985892.stm| title = Science prize seeks new sponsor |accessdate=11 June 2009| date=16 May 2006|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; while sales of [[Helen Dunmore]]'s ''[[A Spell of Winter]]'' quadrupled after being awarded the inaugural prize.&lt;ref name=womenstudies&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Women as Readers, Writers, and Judges The Controversy about the Orange Prize for Fiction| first=Britta|last=Zangen|pages=281–299|issn=0049-7878 |journal=Women's Studies |date=April–May 2003 |volume=32 |issue=3|doi = 10.1080/00497870310066}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Valerie Martin]]'s 2003 award saw her novel sales increase tenfold after the award,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| work=Bookseller|page=17|date=7 May 2004|title = Orange authors eye bright futures}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British libraries, who often support the prize with various promotions, reported success in introducing people to new authors: "48% said that they had tried new writers as a result of the promotion, and 42% said that they would try other books by the new authors they had read."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Library triumph for Orange| page=31|date=1 February 2002|work=Bookseller}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the fact that the prize singles out female writers is not without controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088&amp;sid=aR6wT5dJd5i4&amp;refer=muse |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=7 June 2009 |date=21 April 2009 |title=Robinson, Feldman Make Final Round in Orange Prize for Fiction |first=James |last=Pressley |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019212913/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601088 |archivedate=19 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the prize was founded, [[Auberon Waugh]] nicknamed it the "[[Lemon (automobile)|Lemon]] Prize" while [[Germaine Greer]] claimed there would soon be a prize for "writers with red hair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/mar/06/orangeprizeforfiction2004.orangeprizeforfiction|work=The Guardian |accessdate=7 June 2009|date=6 March 2005|first=Geradline|last=Bedell|title = Textual politics | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Winner of the 1990 Booker Prize, [[A.

No woman has won the award more than once but [[Margaret Atwood]] has been nominated three times without a win.  Since the inaugural award to [[Helen Dunmore]], British writers have won five times, while North American authors have secured the prize nine times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36801">[[Speedruns]] are popular for a large variety of games. Most high-level speedruns have been performed by members of [[Virtual community|online communities]]. The speedrunning community originated on [[internet forum|discussion forums]] in the late 90s and early 2000s, where the fastest routes through early [[first-person shooters]] were discussed. Later-on, as speedrunning became more popular, specific video games became known as common speedrunning candidates. Some modern [[indie games]] are explicitly designed for speedrunning.

December 1993 saw the release of [[id Software|id Software's]] ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]''. Among some of its major features, like at that time unparalleled graphics, LAN- and Internet-based multiplayer support, and user modification possibilities, it also gave the players the ability to record demo files of their playthrough. This particular feature was first picked up by Christina “Strunoph” Norman in January 1994 when she launched the ''LMP Hall of Fame'' website.

This site was, however, quickly obsoleted by the ''DOOM Honorific Titles'', launched in May 1994 by Frank Stajano, which introduced the first serious competition between players.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060208154353/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/DTG/~fms27/dht/dht5/ DOOM Honorific Titles]&lt;/ref&gt; This site would create the basis for all DOOM demosites that would follow. The DHT were designed around a notion of earning titles by successfully recording a particular type of demo on pre-determined maps in the [[IWAD]]s. These 'exams' became very popular as the player had to earn each title by sending in a demo of the feat to one of the site's judges to justify their application. Doom II was released in October 1994, and the DHT conformed to the new additions as well as the new Doom version releases. At the height of its popularity, the DHT had many different categories and playing styles. For example, playing with only the fists and pistol while killing all monsters on a map became known as Tyson mode, named after the heavyweight boxer [[Mike Tyson]]. Pacifist-mode was playing without intentionally harming any monsters. Each category had easy, medium, and hard difficulty maps for players to get randomly chosen for. Many legends in the Doom speedrunning scene started out in the DHT, including George Bell (Tyson), Steffen Udluft (Pacifist), Kai-Uwe “Gazelle” Humpert, Frank “Jesus” Siebers (Nightmare), Thomas “Panter” Pilger (Reality), and Yonatan Donner. Unfortunately, the DHT always had trouble retaining a permanent Internet location. This, combined with the changing rules and the diminished importance of most of the titles, made public interest wane as the years rolled on.

In November 1994, the Doom speedrunning scene, in the form of the COMPET-N website, took off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/index.cgi |title=C O M P E T - N |publisher=Doom2.net |date=2005-06-21 |accessdate=2013-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005005630/http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/index.cgi |archivedate=2013-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its creator, Simon Widlake, intended the site to be a record scoreboard for a variety of Doom-related achievements, but unlike its predecessors, they all centered around one key idea: speed. Players were required to run through Doom's levels as fast as humanly possible in order to attain a spot on the constantly updated COMPET-N scoreboards which eventually made Doom one of the most popular games for speedrunning.{{refn|group=Note |name=Most Popular|This statement is based on both the amount of demos and the total amount of recorded demo time, which far exceed those of other games that are popular with speedrunners.}}

Like the DOOM Honorific Titles, this site experienced multiple location changes over time; it was even at [[Simtel|Cdrom.com]] for a while before István Pataki took over as maintainer and moved the site to the now defunct FTP server [ftp://ftp.sch.bme.hu/ ftp.sch.bme.hu]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}. From there on, since early 1998, it was in the hands of Ádám Hegyi, who has been the maintainer ever since. It was located for some time at [http://www.doom2.net/ Doom2.net]. In 2012, COMPET-N player Zvonimir 'fx' Bužanić took over maintaining the site and re-created a new database for WADs and PWADs. It is currently located at http://www.doom.com.hr/compet-n.

As of March 2006, COMPET-N contains a total amount of 6072 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of 462 hours, 8 minutes and 20 seconds.&lt;ref name="DoomStats"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | title = COMPET-N Database | publisher = COMPET-N | accessdate = March 25, 2006 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060212152418/http://www.doom2.net/~compet-n/database/cn.cgi | archivedate = February 12, 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' was the only game to rival ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' as the most popular game to speedrun.{{refn|group=Note |name=Most Popular}} People first started recording demos of ''Quake'' playthroughs when it was released in June 1996 and sharing them with others on the &lt;tt&gt;demos/e&lt;/tt&gt; directory in [[Simtel|Cdrom.com]]'s ''Quake'' file hierarchy. There were two distinct kinds of demos: those in which the player killed all monsters and found all secrets on the map (called 100% demos) and those in which the player ignored these goals in order to finish the level as fast as possible (called runs). All levels were, at that time, recorded solely on the “Nightmare” difficulty level, the highest in the game.

In April 1997, Nolan “Radix” Pflug first started the Nightmare Speed Demos web site to keep track of the fastest demos. The first ''[[Quake Done Quick]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetquake.com/QdQ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060114082242/http://www.planetquake.com/qdq/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-01-14 |title=Quake done Quick |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date=2006-03-13 |accessdate=2013-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the game, carrying over one level's finishing statistics to the next. The run ended up finishing the entire game on Nightmare difficulty in 0:19:49;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090131110937/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqr.html Quake Done Quick: QdQr]&lt;/ref&gt; an astonishing feat at that time. It received widespread attention from gaming magazines, being distributed with free [[Compact disc|CDs]] that usually came with them. This popularized speedrunning for a much larger audience than before and attracted many newcomers. Not all of those newcomers agreed with the old-timers's dogma that runs should be made on the hardest possible skill level. Thus, in August 1997 Muad'Dib's ''Quake'' Page came to be, run by Gunnar “Muad'Dib” Andre Mo and specializing in “Easy” difficulty runs. One month after that, the famous ''Quake Done Quick'' movie was superseded by a new movie called ''Quake Done Quicker'', on September 14, 1997, which improved the game's fastest playthrough time to 0:16:35.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

In April 1998, Nolan and Gunnar merged their pages, thus creating [[Speed Demos Archive]], which today is still the central repository for ''Quake'' speed demos of any kind. Ever since its creation, a large variety of tricks have been discovered in the ''Quake'' physics, which kept players interested even up to today, more than two decades after Quake's release. Subsequently, ''[[Quake Done Quick|Quake Done Quick with a Vengeance]]'' was released on September 13, 2000, which featured a complete run through ''Quake'' in the hugely improved time of 0:12:23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415034604/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-04-15  |title=Quake Done Quick: QdQwav |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2006, Speed Demos Archive contains a total amount of 8481 demos (on both official and custom maps), accounting for a total time of 253 hours, 44 minutes and 39 seconds.&lt;ref name="QuakeStats"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = https://archive.org/details/Quake_SDA_collection | title = Quake (PC) - Speed demo collection | publisher = Internet Archive | accessdate = March 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fastest minimalist single-segment completion times that have been recorded thus far, as of June 10, 2006, are 0:13:46&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://speeddemosarchive.com/quake/demos/ER/all_1346.dz Downloadable demo]&lt;/ref&gt; for the easy difficulty run and 0:19:50&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://speeddemosarchive.com/quake/demos/NR/all_1950.dz Downloadable demo]&lt;/ref&gt; for the nightmare difficulty run, both by long-time ''Quake'' speedrunner Connor Fitzgerald.

=== ''Quake Done Quick'' ===
{{Main|Quake Done Quick}}
An important aspect of the ''Quake'' speedrunning community is ''[[Quake Done Quick]]'', a collection of movies in which the game is finished as fast as possible with special rules and aims. Unlike the normal records listed above, these movies are created one level at a time rather than in one continuous play session; as such, it is possible for multiple people to help create the movie by sending in demos of individual levels, and much faster times can be aimed for as the segmentation allows one to easily try again upon committing an error. It also allows runners to only have to focus on a small portion of the game rather than all of it.

These movies are by far more popular than the conventional records, both in the community itself and outside of it. Some of them, most notably the movies that feature a fast playthrough of the game on the Nightmare difficulty level without additional voluntary challenges, have even been distributed with gaming magazines and posted on news sites. [[Slashdot]] has published an announcement of the then newly created ''Quake Done Quick with a Vengeance'' movie on its front page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/09/14/1223230&amp;tid=112 |title=Slashdot &amp;#124; Quake Done Quick - With A Vengeance |publisher=Games.slashdot.org |date=2000-09-14 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all the series' movies, this one is also the most popular. In it, the entire game is finished in 0:12:23 on “Nightmare” difficulty, the hardest in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221161546/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqwav.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-02-21  |title=Quake Done Quick: QdQwav |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This run succeeded ''Quake Done Quicker'' and the original ''Quake done Quick'' &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090131110937/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/qdqr.html ]&lt;/ref&gt; movie, in which the game was finished in respectively 0:16:35 and 0:19:49.&lt;ref name="QuakeDoneQuicker"&gt;{{cite web | year = 1997 | url = http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/all_1635.txt| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080103145316/http://qdq.planetquake.gamespy.com/all_1635.txt | dead-url = yes | archive-date = January 3, 2008  | title = Quake done Quicker | publisher = Quake done Quick | author = The Quake done Quick team | accessdate = December 25, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for the latest installment being over 4 minutes faster, an improvement that surpassed the initial expectations of the runners,&lt;ref name="SequenceBreakingExample"&gt;{{cite web|year=2006 |url=http://www.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?qdq/qdqwav.dz |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204054530/http://www.fileplanet.com/dl/dl.asp?qdq%2Fqdqwav.dz |dead-url=yes |archive-date=February 4, 2012 |title=History of the routes in QdQwav |publisher=FilePlanet |author=The Quake done Quick team |accessdate=March 26, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the discovery of [[bunny hopping]], which allowed runners to attain a much higher speed in most levels and even made it possible to save rockets or grenades for jumps that could now be done without them.&lt;ref name="BunnyHopReference"&gt;See the [[Speedrun#Techniques 2|Quake Techniques]] paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; This movie is currently being improved by new and old runners for a production called ''Quake done Quick with a Vengeance Part II''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speeddemosarchive.com/quake/projects/qdqwavp2/ |title=Quake done Quickest |publisher=Speeddemosarchive.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2006, the improvements that have been made thus far would result in a time of 0:11:32 for the entire game, an improvement of 51 seconds.&lt;ref name="QuakeDoneQuickWithAVengeancePartIIProgress"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://speeddemosarchive.com/quake/projects/qdqwavp2/tables.html | title = Quake done Quick with a Vengeance Part II | publisher = Speed Demos Archive | author = Speed Demos Archive contributors | accessdate = May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the productions have been turned into [[Machinima]] movies, using so-called “recams” (showing the run from preset camera perspectives rather than the first-person view) and sometimes even custom skins, models, and a script to turn them into [[film]]s rather than speedrun videos.

== ''Metroid'' series ==
''[[Super Metroid]]'' (Nintendo, 1994) achieved popularity with speedrunners due to the emergence of console emulators with demo-recording features.&lt;ref name=1up&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3142599&amp;did=1|title = Smashing the Clock|publisher = 1UP.com| last=Turner|first=Benjamin |date=2005-08-10|accessdate = August 13, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In normal ''Super Metroid'' gameplay, the player may find certain items such as "high-jump boots". Since the path through the map is non-linear, it is complicated to find the most efficient speedrunning routes: areas with seemingly essential power-ups can be bypassed at the expense of the improved mobility. This drove the discovery of [[sequence breaking]], in which a player can acquire power-ups before the game design intends, allowing whole sections of the map to be skipped.&lt;ref name=1up/&gt; As of September 2018 the current Any%{{refn|group=Note |name=Any|"Any%" refers to beating a game without having to play through any optional content, and, in Super Metroid's case, without the use of major glitches.}} world record is held by speedrunner Behemoth, with a time of 41 minutes and 18 seconds.

Because the ''Metroid'' series awards players for completing the game with a faster time, groups of player were inspired to discuss techniques on message boards such as [[GameFAQs]] and to capture and post video of full playthroughs. Despite internet limitations in the early 2000s, the ability to share video footage of ''Metroid'' runs allowed speedrunners to collaborate and learn from one another.&lt;ref name="Bad Jump"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/10/zelda-wind-waker-speedrun/|publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''|title=For the World’s Fastest Gamers, Failure Is Just One Bad Jump Away|last=Rigney|first=Ryan|date=2013-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during online discussions of ''[[Metroid Prime]]'' that the term "sequence breaking" was first widely used.&lt;ref name="Polygon money"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2014/1/9/5280786/making-money-zelda-speed-runner|publisher=''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''|title=Making money as a Zelda speed runner|last=Li|first=Roland|date=2014-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Super Mario'' series ==
[[File:Super_Mario_World_arbitrary_code_injection.jpg|thumb|left|By injecting [[arbitrary code execution|arbitrary code]] into the memory of ''[[Super Mario World]]'' in the form of [[video game sprite|graphical sprites]], speedrunners can reprogram the entire game on the fly.&lt;ref name="PC MAG arbitrary code" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ars" /&gt;]]
{{see also|List of Super Mario speedrunning records}}

Early [[platform games]] of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series are popular in the speedrunning community. ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'', ''[[Yoshi's Island]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' are particularly notable for speedrunning accomplishments. Most notable speedruns of ''Super Mario'' games are generally carried out without [[Tool-assisted speedrun|tool-assistance]], though speedrunners make frequent use of [[video game glitch|glitches]] and even [[memory corruption]] to make optimal times.

The current record holder of the first game in the ''Super Mario'' series, ''Super Mario Bros.'', is speedrunner somewes, who beat the game in 4 minutes, 55 seconds, and 796 milliseconds on October 22, 2018. This was done by using many frame-perfect tricks and in-game warps. More novel achievements have also been accomplished in ''Super Mario Bros.'', such as beating the game with the [[Score (game)#Video games|lowest score possible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/guy-beats-super-mario-bros-with-the-lowest-score-possib-1526905435|publisher=''Kotaku''|title=Guy Beats Super Mario Bros.

The record-time for beating ''Super Mario World'' is in the hands of speedrunner FURiOUS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Super Mario World Leaderboard |url=https://www.speedrun.com/smw#0_Exit |website=speedrun.com |accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who beat the game in 41 seconds and 866 milliseconds on June 19, 2018. This was done by making the credits of the game roll using [[arbitrary code execution|arbitrary code injection]] in the first level of the game, however this is not considered an entirely fair way of beating the game, and is best done using tool-assistance.&lt;ref name="PC MAG arbitrary code"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2475640,00.asp|publisher=''PC Magazine''|title=Speedrunner 'Beats' Super Mario World in Under 5 Minutes|last=Murphy|first=David|date=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ars"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/01/how-an-emulator-fueled-robot-reprogrammed-super-mario-world-on-the-fly/|publisher=''Ars Technica''|title=How an emulator-fueled robot reprogrammed Super Mario World on the fly|last=Orland|first=Kyle|date=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremetech.com/extreme/174659-super-mario-world-speedrun-hack-takes-up-up-down-down-left-right-left-right-b-a-to-the-next-level|publisher=''ExtremeTech''|title=Super Mario World speedrun hack takes up up down down left right left right B A to the next level|last=Anthony|first=Sebastian|date=2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2015/01/22/super-mario-world-record-_n_6522082.html|publisher=''The Huffington Post''|title='Super Mario World' Speedrun Record Smashed Using Bizarre Glitch|last=Rundle|first=Michael|date=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island'' is a game that is very commonly speedrun at [[Awesome Games Done Quick]]. Charlie Hall of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' has described speedruns of ''Yoshi's Island'' as a "great introduction to the showmanship and the rich community" behind the Games Done Quick marathons. Through exchanging strategies and doing theory routing, the ''Yoshi's Island'' speedrunning community collaboratively work on pushing the time down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/why-speed-running-is-the-greatest-thing-about-gaming-729|publisher=''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''|title=Why Speed-Running Is the Greatest Thing About Gaming|last=Whelan|first=David|date=2015-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/27/9047665/sgdq-trihex-yoshis-island-2015|publisher=''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''|title=SGDQ's first run shows off the skill, community that makes it all possible|last=Hall|first=Charlie|date=2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/02/05/twitch-tv-speedrun-interview/|publisher=''VentureBeat''|title=Can live speedruns compete with e-sports?

It is possible to speedrun ''Super Mario 64'' in various ways. Though speedruns exist of people playing through the game as intended, it is possible to skip large portions of ''Super Mario 64'' by using glitches. Using a glitch dubbed the "backwards long jump," with which the [[player character]] can move through walls, a player can skip almost all levels of the game and beat it in only a few minutes.&lt;ref name="Bad Jump" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nintendo Glitches"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/arts/5-nintendo-games-you-can-beat-in-minutes-because-of-glitches-6387128|publisher=''[[Houston Press]]''|title=5 Nintendo games you can beat in minutes because of glitches|last=Rouner|first=Jeff|date=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Completing ''Super Mario 64'' 100%—i.e., collecting all the game's "stars"—is also a popular method of playing through the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geek.com/games/super-mario-64-speedrun-world-record-accidentally-broken-1616736/|publisher=''Geek''|title=Super Mario 64 speedrun world record accidentally broken|last=Humphries|first=Matthew|date=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/guy-breaks-super-mario-64-world-record-by-accident-1688469992|publisher=''Kotaku''|title=Race Leads To New World Record For Collecting 120 Super Mario 64 Stars|last=Hernandez|first=Patricia|date=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the 120 Stars category has become much more competitive. The current record time for Super Mario 64 in the "120 Stars" category was set on February 8, 2018 by the Twitch streamer Cheese05 with a time of 1 hour, 39 minutes, and 19 seconds.

The [[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|original ''The Legend of Zelda'']] and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' are popular speedrunning candidates. The record for the first game in the series is currently held by speedrunner LackAttack24 in 28 minutes and 37 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.twitch.tv/videos/165262422?t=02s|title=(28:37) The Legend of Zelda - any% no up+a (current world record)|last=|first=|date=2017-07-08|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any%{{refn|group=Note |name=Any}} speedruns of this game involve a great deal of movement optimization and item drop management, as well as some amount of luck.

===''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time''===

''Ocarina of Time'' speedruns used to take hours to carry out, as the game contains a large amount of long, mandatory dungeons. During the 2000s, the community of Speed Demo Archives discovered various glitches in the game that allowed players to skip portions of it. The "Door of Time Skip", for instance, allows player character [[Link (character)|Link]] to sequence break and skip many of the game's levels by passing through a wall. In 2012, the "Wrong Warp" glitch was discovered, which allowed Link to [[warp (gaming)|teleport]] from the first dungeon to the final boss of the game, making 20 minute speedruns of ''Ocarina of Time'' possible.&lt;ref name="Polygon money" /&gt;

Speedruns of ''Ocarina of Time'' are somewhat dependent of the [[video game console|console]] the game is played on. Originally, speedrunners played ''Ocarina of Time'' on the Chinese-only [[iQue Player]], because it has quicker loading times and faster scrolling text than the [[Nintendo 64]] version. However, the current record was achieved with the Japanese version of ''Ocarina of Time'' played on the [[Wii Virtual Console]], as this version of the game includes an exploitable glitch not present in other versions.&lt;ref name="Gamerant Ocarina"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gamerant.com/world-record-ocarina-of-time-speedrun-skater82297/|publisher=''Gamerant''|title=Gamer Sets New World Record for ‘Ocarina of Time’ Speedrun|last=Gates|first=Christopher|date=2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time'' has been described as "one of the most intricate and well-documented games for speed running" because of its familiarity and potential for glitches.&lt;ref name="Polygon money" /&gt; The current any% world record is in hands of skater82297, with a time of 17 minutes and 07 seconds, beating Torje's previous record of 17 minutes and 09 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.speedrun.com/oot|publisher=''Speedrun.com''|title=Ocarina of Time|date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current 100% world record is held at a time of 3 hours 53 minutes and 33 seconds, which belongs to American runner Zfg, who has held the 100% speedrun world record since March 19, 2015 and had previously become the first person to complete the 100% run in under 4 hours, doing so on August 1, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.speedrun.com/oot#100|title=The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time - Leaderboard - speedrun.com|last=|first=|date=|website=speedrun.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/3/17649600/zelda-ocarina-of-time-speedrun-100-percent-world-record|title=Ocarina of Time speedrunner breaks four-hour barrier for a 100% run (Corrected)|work=Polygon|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2018/08/its-been-a-groundbreaking-month-for-ocarina-of-time-speedrunning/|title=It's Been A Groundbreaking Month For Ocarina Of Time Speedrunning|date=2018-08-25|work=Kotaku Australia|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Dark Souls'' series==
''[[Dark Souls]]'', a 2011 game by [[From Software]], is known for its unforgiving gameplay, but despite this, the game is very popular among speedrunners. Through the use of several intricate skips, glitches, and wrong warps, it is possible to complete an Any%{{refn|group=Note |name=Any}} run in under 35 minutes, though average players take dozens of hours playing through the game once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5966725/watch-this-speed-run-take-down-dark-souls-in-32-minutes|publisher=''Kotaku''|title=Watch This Speed Run Take Down Dark Souls in 32 Minutes|last=Narcisse|first=Evan|date=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/dark-souls-speed-run-record-completes-the-game-in-less-than-50-minutes/|publisher=''PC Gamer''|title=Dark Souls speed run record completes the game in less than 50 minutes |last=Presscot|first=Shaun|date=2015-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/01/19/dark-souls-how-long-does-it-take-to-beat-speed-run-record/|publisher=''[[VG247]]''|title=Dark Souls beaten in less than 50 minutes in new speed run record|last=Hillier|first=Brenna|date=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2011/10/16/dark-souls-speed-run-is-a-tour-de-force-of-tolerance/|publisher=''[[Engadget]]''|title=Dark Souls speed run is a tour de force of tolerance|last=Mallory|first=Jordan|date=2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21-minute speedruns are possible because of a glitch dubbed the "Kiln Skip", which can be used to skip almost the entire second half of the game. The original method for this exploit was removed in an update,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/12/18/dark-souls-speedrun/|publisher=''VentureBeat''|title=Guinness World Record holder breaks down his half-hour Dark Souls speedrun (interview)|last=Haley|first=Sebastian|date=2012-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-19-watch-dark-souls-completed-in-under-50-minutes|publisher=''Eurogamer''|title= Watch Dark Souls completed in under 50 minutes|last=Matulef|first=Jeffrey|date=2015-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2015/01/man-breaks-dark-souls-speed-run-world-record-still-thinks-he-sucks/|publisher=''kotaku Australia''|title=Man Breaks Dark Souls World Record, Still Thinks He Sucks|last=Serrels|first=Mark|date=2015-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a new method of performing it, which requires the current game update, has also been devised. The current world record for the All Bosses category speedrun is held by CapitaineToinon, clocking in at 1:09:02 IGT (in-game time).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://speedsouls.com/darksouls:All_Bosses|title=All Bosses - Speed Souls - A Dark Souls Speedrunning Wiki|website=speedsouls.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any% runs of its sequel, ''[[Dark Souls II]]'', can be done in under 20 minutes, as it is possible to avoid almost all battles in the game and to move around the world at a "ridiculous pace" using the "binoculars" item. The tricks that make a run this short possible were patched out, but can still be used if current patches aren't downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-2-completed-in-20-minutes/1100-6420071/|publisher=''[[GameSpot]]''|title=Dark Souls 2 Completed in 20 Minutes|last=Newhouse|first=Alex|date=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/3/5775250/dark-souls-2-speed-run|publisher=''Polygon''|title=This Dark Souls 2 player can speed run through the game in 20 minutes|last=Gera|first=Emily|date=2014-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/it-s-possible-to-beat-dark-souls-ii-in-20-minutes-275813.phtml|publisher=''Destructoid''|title=It's possible to beat Dark Souls II in 20 minutes|last=Devore|first=Jordan|date=2014-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Spelunky''==
''[[Spelunky]]'', a 2012 indie [[platform game|platformer]] created by [[Derek Yu]], has been a common candidate for speedrunning, with its fastest runs taking between one and two minutes. As ''Spelunky'' features a large amount of random [[procedural generation]], speedrunners cannot solely rely on memorization. To have a chance in beating the current record, a speedrunner must get a specific [[random seed]], though despite this, skillful players may recognize repeating level patterns and know how to optimally use the game's items, such as a difficult to use "teleporter" that allows a player to skip large chunks of a level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-05-07-spelunky-speedrun-world-record-set-at-1-47-182|publisher=''[[Eurogamer]]''|title=Spelunky speedrun world record set at 1:47.182|last=Matulef|first=Jeffrey|date=2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-07-14-spelunky-speed-run-sets-new-world-record|publisher=''Eurogamer''|title=Spelunky speed run sets new world record|last=Matulef|first=Jeffrey|date=2014-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/8/18/9171939/watch-spelunky-beaten-in-101-seconds-in-a-world-record-speed-run|publisher=''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]''|title=Watch Spelunky beaten in 101 seconds in a world record speed run|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|date=2015-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/spelunky-world-record-speedrun-looks-like-magic-1703102779|publisher=''Kotaku''|title=Spelunky World Record Speedrun Looks Like Magic|last=Klepek|first=Patrick|date=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the high difficulty of the game, even ''Spelunky''{{'s}} "Hell" levels have been used for speedrunning, with the world record sitting under four minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/8/13/9150207/spelunky-speedrun-hell-world-record-3-minutes-44-seconds|publisher=''Polygon''|title=See someone finish Spelunky in less time than it takes us to make a sandwich|last=Kollar|first=Philip|date=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another highly difficult run of the game is the so-called "[[eggplant run]]", in which a player has to go through a specific set of objectives to turn the final boss into an [[eggplant]]. This was done [[single-player game|solo]] for the first time in November 2013 by speedrunner [[Bananasaurus Rex]], though it took him 90 minutes. Douglas Wilson of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' dubbed this run "2013's most fascinating video game moment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/spelunkys-first-solo-eggplant-run-completed-makes-for-a-tense-hour-of-platforming/|publisher=''PC Gamer''|title=Spelunky's first solo eggplant run completed, makes for a tense hour of platforming|last=Morrison|first=Angus|date=2013-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/11/11/5093020/spelunky-eggplant-run-video|publisher=''Polygon''|title=Spelunky player achieves the elusive solo Eggplant Run|last=Tach|first=Dave|date=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/12/23/5227726/anatomy-of-a-spelunky-miracle-or-how-the-internet-finally-beat|publisher=''Polygon''|title=A breakdown of 2013's most fascinating video game moment|last=Wilson|first=Douglas|date=2013-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4676">'''Mourlot Studios''' was a commercial print shop founded in 1852 by the [[Mourlot]] family and located in Paris, France. It was also known as Imprimerie Mourlot, Mourlot Freres and Atelier Mourlot. Founded by Francois Mourlot, it started off producing [[wallpaper]]. Later, his son Jules Mourlot would expand the business to handle the production of chocolate labels for companies such as [[Chocolat Poulain]], as well as ledgers, maps and stationary.
Starting in the 1920s, Jules' son, [[Fernand Mourlot]], converted one of the locations into a studio dedicated to printing fine art [[lithography]].

== History ==
One of the most important contribution of the Mourlot Studio was to be the art poster. For the [[Eugène Delacroix]] exhibition in 1930, the [[Daumier]] exhibition and the [[Manet]] exhibition at the French National Museums, Mourlot became the place where posters were prepared and produced as works of art in their own right. 

Another important feature would be the production of fine art, limited edition lithographs. The first painters to create lithographs at Mourlot were [[Vlaminck]] and [[Utrillo]], despite most artists abandoning the one-popular 19th century lithography, during the first part of the 20th century. Lithography, which was invented by Aloys Senefelder at the end of the 18th century, reached fame when it was adopted by artists such as [[Jules Chéret]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Pierre Bonnard|Bonnard]] and [[Vuillard]] in the 1880s. Beginning in the 1930s, Fernand Mourlot (the grandson of the founder of Mourlot studios) began inviting a new generation of artists to work directly on lithography stones (in the same manner as one does when creating a poster).  This expansion of fine art into the printing realm began a previously non-existent partnership between artist and printer which remains to this day.
[[File:Kingandmcgaw-popup-shop-mourlot-studios.jpg|right|thumb|King &amp; McGaw's 2015 Mourlot exhibit in London]]
In 1937, the studio created two posters, one by Bonnard and one by [[Henri Matisse]], for the Maitres de l'Art indépendant exhibition at the Petit Palais. Both artists were so impressed by the posters' excellent quality that Mourlot studio became the leading lithographic printer for fine artwork. That same year, the studio also began a long collaboration with the editor Tériade, who founded the legendary art review "Verve." After the Second World War, Mourlot assisted Matisse, [[Braque]], [[Pierre Bonnard|Bonnard]], [[Rouault]] and [[Joan Miró]] in the creation of important lithographs for the review.

In 1945, [[Pablo Picasso]] selected the Mourlot studio for his return to the lithographic medium. Set up in a corner of the shop, it would soon become his home for several months at a time. Between 1945 and 1969, Picasso created over four hundred lithographs at Mourlot. This collaboration would break new ground in the lithographic process and lend a new dimension to Picasso's work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiaf.org/laboutique/mourlot History of 20th century lithography by Picasso, Matisse, Chagall, Braque, Leger at Atelier Mourlot, French Institute Alliance Française (FIAF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723085822/http://www.fiaf.org/laboutique/mourlot |date=2012-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 King &amp; McGaw used a [[pop-up retail|pop-up]] shop to showcase lithographic posters from the Mourlot Studios archives in [[Soho]], [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/atelier-mourlot&lt;/ref&gt; Contributions from artists such as

'''Portrayal of female bodies in Chinese contemporary art''' has become a lot more diverse as women artists start to rise in China. Many contemporary Chinese women artists have employed the use of female bodies as the subject of their artworks. From the ancient and imperial period of China until early the 19th century, women's body images in Chinese art were predominantly portrayed through male artists' lenses. As a result, female bodies were often misrepresented. With the arrival of [[modernism]] in Chinese contemporary art, women now have more influences in the field of [[visual arts]]. Chinese women artists employ unconventional artistic expressions in order to speak about their experiences of being a female and an artist in a patriarchal society. Although the Chinese visual art field has been more inclusive in the recent decades, women artists’ representation in major art [[exhibition]]s is still significantly less than male artists. Therefore, artists and curators have made a joint effort to devote certain art exhibitions to just Chinese women artists.

== Historical Context ==
=== Ancient and Imperial Period ===
[[File:Chinese - Landscape with Figures - Walters 35101O.jpg|thumb]]
Traditionally, female bodies were only valued as carriers for the family bloodline. In traditional paintings, nude women were a taboo for the artists. As a result, the portrayal of women's bodies was formulaic, always with slim figures, usually leaning on another object or have a slightly bent posture to further emphasize their delicate bodies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mary|first=Fong|date=Summer 1996|title=Images of Women in Traditional Chinese Painting|jstor=1358525|journal=Woman's Art Journal|volume=17|pages=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female images would also demonstrate ideal qualities of women at that time. Aside from feminine beauty and charm, she should also possess the virtues of subordinating herself in a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] patriarchal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Nigris|first=Ornella|date=March 2016|title=Traditional imagery of women as seen through female visual art: Hung Liu|url=|journal=International Communication of Chinese Culture|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women in these ancient paintings all wore long silk skirts that came down to the ankles. They could only show the part of their body above their chest. Their appearance, combined with their slender body figures, showed the submissive and demure qualities, which was desirable for male audiences.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 1970s-1980s ===
A drastic change in ideal femininity occurred in 1966 and 1967 when the [[Cultural Revolution]] in China took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Art of Modern China|last=Andres|first=Julia|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|isbn=9780520238145|location=|pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cultural Revolution, led by [[Mao Zedong]], denounced the traditional image of women's inferiority and calls for a women's liberation in the new China. Propaganda tools, such as performance art, films, and posters, strongly supported this movement and effectively constructed and broadcast a new female identity. Feminine beauty was no longer characterized by delicate figures, but instead by masculinized images of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhuying|date=2015|title=Female Masculinity and the Image of Women in the Chinese Cultural Revolution|url=|journal=The International Academic Forum|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "Iron girls" represented the permissible appearances of women in the 1970s. They should not wear anything that showed their female curves. Moreover, women were encouraged to dress like men and go to work like men did, given that Mao called for a "gender erasure" in order to make "Chinese women in new China."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pei|first=Yuxin|date=2006|title=Iron Girls, Strong Women, Beautiful Women Writers and Super Girls: A Discourse Analysis of the Gender Performance of Women in Contemporary China|url=|journal=Lilith: A Feminist History Journal|volume=15|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to "Iron Girls," "Strong Women" images were popularized through mass media, such as [[cartoon]]s and local newspapers. Their appearance was defined by masculinized traits: tanned skin tone, sturdy figures, and blue and black work uniforms. Feminine features, like smooth skin and hands, were seen as something to be ashamed of because they were expected to be contributing to the nation's economy like men did.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Contemporary Portrayal of Women Bodies ==

=== Installation ===

==== "Trauma" ====
In her installation series, "Trauma", [[Hung Liu]] portrays a bound-foot woman. [[Foot binding]] was practiced among Chinese women from the Song dynasty up until the early 20th century. Women would wrap their feet tightly in order to keep them small, which was characterized as a feminine beauty at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Body|last=Pitts-Taylor|first=Victoria|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2008|isbn=9780313341458|location=|pages=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Liu's installation pieces, she repeatedly shows an emotionless woman with her naked feet. As a result of the foot binding cultural, these women had deformed feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Elaine H.|date=|title="Bad Women": Asian American Visual Artists Hanh Thi Pham, Hung Liu, and Yong Soon Min|jstor=3178131|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=22|pages=589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paintings ===

==== Feng Jiali's Oil Paintings ====
Feng Jiali is famous for her [[oil painting]] of explicit images of [[female]] bodies. A series of her paintings depict young, school-aged [[Chinese people|Chinese]] girls, usually skimpily dressed in the bath or laying in bed. The girls in her paintings almost always look directly at the viewers, some innocent-looking, some with a confrontational gaze.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hwee Leng Teo|first=Phyllis|date=January 2010|title=Alternative Agency in Representation by Contemporary Chinese Women Artists|url=|journal=Asian Culture and History|volume=2|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another series of her works involves photographs of her [[Pregnancy|pregnant]] body. By revealing her own pregnant body fearlessly in front of the camera, she challenges the traditional views of pregnant body as something private and a mean to continue the family line, favoring boys over girls, and following the [[one-child policy]]. Because pregnant [[Nude (art)|nude]] is normally not defined as the ideal beauty found in female bodies, Feng’s photo collage expresses another aspect of being a woman. She desired to express the hardships and anxieties of being pregnant, which contradicts with the conventional, sacred portrayal of childbirth by many male artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/853244969|title=New modern Chinese women and gender politics : the centennial of the end of the Qing Dynasty|last=Chen|first=Ya-chen|publisher=Routledge|others=|year=2014|isbn=9780415841382|location=New York|pages=115|oclc=853244969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Banana Leaves Series" ====
Cai Jin, another contemporary oil painter, also challenges the traditional taboos of nudity in ancient Chinese art history. Unlike Feng Jiali, however, Cai articulates female bodies in a semi-abstract way by using organic elements in her paintings. A series of her paintings depict women's bodies shaped like banana tree leaves. Unlike many conventional portrayals of the female body that serves in the interest of male audiences, Cai painted the bodies like decomposed flesh, which is then metamorphosed into dripping, red, [[Banana leaf|banana leaves]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Traditionally, plants, especially flowers, are associated with femininity. However, Cai made a modern twist on this subject and made it into a somewhat unpleasant-looking and distorted image, rejecting the stereotypical delicate women and flowers association.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Like how Feng declared that pregnant bodies can be art too, Cai had made an assertion that although women's bodies aren't always going to be maintained in a perfect way, they can still become a form of art.

=== Performance Arts ===

==== "Opening of the Great Wall" ====

In ''Opening of the Great Wall'', He Chengyao presented her own naked body in a public space in 2001 and took a series of photographs of herself. The photographs documented her walking confidently with her upper body being nude. She held her bright red bra on her right hand and tied her sweater around the waist. She had a deadpan expression on her face and a confident posture as she walks toward the camera. The photo was taken on the [[Great Wall of China]], which is one of the most popular scenic spots in [[Beijing]], China.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Negotiating Difference : Chinese Contemporary Art in the Global Context|last=Birgit|first=Hopfener|publisher=Verlag und Datenbank fur Geisteswissenschaften|year=2012|isbn=9783897397170|location=Weimar, Germany|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:"Your Body" by Xiang Jing at The Saatchi Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|''Your Body'' (2005, fiberglass &amp; paint, 270×160×150cm) at The Saatchi Gallery, The Revolution Continues: New Art from China, 2008]]
Despite the fact that she was surrounded by many curious tourists, He still maintained a confident look. She had also spontaneously joined in an [[Installation art|installation]] by a male artist, [[HA Schult|H.A. Schult]], which was exhibited on the Great Wall at the same time. Whether intended or not, she had made her appearance as a Chinese women artist in the mainstream of male art production. Furthermore, although her piece took place in 2001, women's nudity in public spaces was still considered taboo at the time.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Czechónska|first=Magdalena|date=2012|title=Body Linguistic Visibility and Retrieved Bodies of the 20th and 21st Century in Chinese Women's Literature and Art|url=|journal=The Central European Journal of Social Sciences and Humanities|volume=25|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== "Broadcast Exercise" ====

He Chengyao completed this [[performance art]] piece in 2004 at the Shanghai Doland Museum of Modern Art, which combined the themes of body and identity. As the title of the piece suggested, He Chengyao performed a series of exercises in front of a large group of audiences, while her naked body was tightly wrapped with tape.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Her movement caused the tape to be ripped apart one by one. She also wrapped her self with the sticky side of the tape out, which made her body parts stuck together and making it increasingly harder to perform the exercise.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Sculpture ===

==== "Your Body" ====
[[Xiang Jing (artist)|Xiang Jing]] is a Beijing-based sculptor. She is best known for her depiction of realistic nude women sculptures. One of her sculptures, "Your Body", portrays a nude and bald woman slumping in a chair with her legs spread open. There's a prominent scar on the right side of her abdomen. She has sagging breasts, belly fat rolls, and blank expression on her face. None of these qualities fall under the expectation of the ideal female body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xhingyu|date=October 2009|title=Xiang Jing: Shanghai Art Museum|url=|journal=Sculpture|volume=28|pages=78|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Representation of Contemporary Women Artists in Exhibitions ==
Though efforts have been made in order to make the visual art field more inclusive, women's artworks have still been underrepresented in major [[exhibition]]s. In the late 1980s, when the first major Chinese Art exhibition took place, only five women, out of sixty-seven artists and participants, were included in the show. While artists from mainland China, [[Taiwan]], and [[Hong Kong]], were being recognized for their diverse identities, women artists' participation in this first Chinese exhibition were not acknowledged.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Similarly, in the traveling exhibition, ''Transience: Chinese Experimental Art at the End of Twentieth Century'' in 1998, only three women artists presented their artworks. The curator of this exhibition, Wu Hung, intended to provide a platform for experimental Chinese art to take place. However, it appears that women's innovative artistic expressions were still being excluded and didn't gain as many recognition as male Chinese artists have had.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The issue of unequal representation among male and female Chinese artists did receive some attention from the public. As a result, curators and artists have made a joint effort to devote certain exhibition and publications solely for female artists.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Century Women'', National Gallery of China, Beijing (1998) ===

''Century Women'' was one of the first exhibitions dedicated to Chinese women artists. It intended to raise awareness on female experiences, roles, subject matters, and most importantly, art practices through the perspective of women living in contemporary Chinese society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to providing a platform to showcase artworks made by Chinese women, it also exhibited photos and documents showing women's art production in China. More than seventy artists participated in this exhibition and presented over five hundred pieces of artworks&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== ''Her Presence in Colors VIII: International Women Artists Exhibition,'' National Gallery of China, Beijing (2008) ===

This exhibition was held concurrently around the world, such as China, [[Singapore]], [[Germany]], and the [[United States]], to spread pan-Asian feminist artworks. Specifically, the show in [[New York City|New York]], ''Against the Tide (1998),'' featured five female artists who were born in China and grew up during the Cultural Revolution. Cai Jin, who also participated in this show, presented her Banana Plant series in the show, which is a suggestive form of presenting female nude bodies in a public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/08/arts/art-in-review-534161.html|title=Art in Review|last=Cotter|first=Holland|access-date=2018-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many views are held or have been expressed by '''religious organisations''' in relation to '''same-sex marriage'''. Arguments both in favor of and in opposition to [[same-sex marriage]] are often made on religious grounds and/or formulated in terms of religious doctrine. Although the majority of world religions oppose to same-sex marriage, the number of religious denominations that are conducting same-sex marriages have been increasing in recent times. Religious views on same-sex marriage are closely related to [[Homosexuality and religion|religious views on homosexuality]].

==Religious support==

===Buddhism===
{{See also|Buddhism and sexual orientation}}
Due to the ambivalent language about homosexuality in [[Buddhist]] teachings, there has been no official stance put forth regarding the issue of marriage between members of the same gender.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life: Issues. (May 20, 2008. [http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=291 ''Religious Groups' Official Positions on Same-Sex Marriage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109194247/http://pewforum.org/docs/?DocID=291 |date=2008-11-09 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no objection of the Buddha found in the Tipitaka. Buddha was neither supportive nor against marriages between members of the same gender. Also, from the Tipitaka, it is clear that the Buddha acknowledged the difference between hermaphrodites and homosexual practitioners. Hermaphrodites and eunuchs are not allowed to be ordained, but there is no sanction against homosexuality. As for the lay homosexual people, Buddha gave no rule or advice as to whether they should be allowed to marry or not. Buddha posted himself simply as the one who shows the way. He did not insist that he had any right to enforce on others what they should do. With this principle, the original teachings of the Buddha do not cover social ceremonies or rituals. Weddings and marriages of all kinds are regarded as mundane and have no place in Buddhism.&lt;ref name = Mettanando&gt;Mettanando Bhikkhu (July 13, 2005). [http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=70,1429,0,0,1,0 ''Religion and Same-Sex Marriage.''] The Buddhist Channel: Bringing Buddha Dharma Home - Issues. ''The Bangkok Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 11, 1995, some religious leaders gave testimony to the Commission on Sexual Orientation and the Law in support of same-gender marriages. [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]], co-founder and teacher of the Honolulu Diamond Sangha, a Zen Buddhist society established in 1959, with centers in Manoa and Palolo, gave written testimony on the subject of same-sex marriage. Aitken explains that by applying the Four Noble Abodes (loving kindness, compassion, joy in the attainment of others, and equanimity) to the issue of same-sex marriage, he finds compassion for and with the gay or lesbian couple who wish to confirm their love in a legal marriage. Aitken cites a precept about sex which Zen Buddhists inherit from earlier classical Buddhists teachings.

It is one of the sixteen precepts accepted by all Zen Buddhist monks, nuns and seriously committed lay people. He understands this to mean that self-centered sexual conduct is inappropriate, and he vows to avoid it. He believes that self-centered sex is exploitive sex, non-consensual sex, sex that harms others.  It is unwholesome and destructive in a heterosexual as well as in a homosexual context. He goes on to explain that The Legislative Reference Bureau compiled a formidable list of rights that are extended to married couples in Hawai'i, but which are denied to couples
who are gay and lesbian.

He argues that gay and lesbian unions would be "settled even more" if they were acknowledged with basic married rights. Aitken says, "A long-standing injustice would be corrected, and the entire gay and lesbian community would feel more accepted. This would stabilize a significant segment of our society, and we would all of us be better able to acknowledge our diversity. I urge you to advise the Legislature and the people of Hawai'i that legalizing gay and lesbian marriages will
be humane and in keeping with perenniel principles of decency and mutual encouragement."&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, T. (January 6, 1996). [http://www.qrd.org/qrd/religion/zen.buddhist.perspective.on.same.sex.marriage "A Zen Buddhist perspective on same-gender marriage."]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{See also|Christianity and sexual orientation|Christianity and homosexuality}}
Support and affirmation of marriage rights for same-sex couples generally comes from certain Christian denominations that are considered theologically liberal. Some examples of religious organizations voicing their support for same-sex marriage include [[Metropolitan Community Church]], the [[United Church of Christ]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.org/lgbt/issues/marriage-equality/|title=Marriage Equality and the UCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United Church of Canada]], the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheFourPrioritiesoftheChurch/tabid/273/Default.aspx ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916035526/http://www.disciples.org/AboutTheDisciples/TheFourPrioritiesoftheChurch/tabid/273/Default.aspx |date=September 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church of the United States]], the [[Anglican Church of Canada]], the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church In America]],the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]],  the [[Church of Denmark]], the [[Church of Sweden]], the [[Church of Norway]], the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]], the [[United Protestant Church of France]], the [[United Protestant Church in Belgium]], the [[Icelandic Church]], the [[Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau]], the [[Evangelical Church in Berlin, Brandenburg and Silesian Upper Lusatia]], the [[Evangelical Church in the Rhineland]], the [[Protestant Church in Baden]],the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Northern Germany]], the [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)]], the [[Quaker]]s, the liberal [[Old Catholic Church]] and the [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalists]] church which supports the rights of gays and lesbians to marry both in the church and through the state.&lt;ref&gt;

Some biblical scholars who hold to a more theologically liberal Christian view of same-sex marriage, such as representatives of the Metropolitan Community Church, make the claim that the word "homosexual" as found in many modern versions of the Bible is an interpolation and is not found in the original biblical texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohnsmcc.org/new/BibleAbuse/ |title=Welcome - Bible Abuse Directed at Homosexuals |publisher=Stjohnsmcc.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument from scripture holds that since the original authors of the Bible never mention 'homosexuals' or committed Christian homosexual couples, there cannot exist a biblical prohibition of marriage rights for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaychurch.org/Gay_and_Christian_YES/the_bible_christianity_and_homosexuality_justin_cannon.htm |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923075213/http://www.gaychurch.org/gay_and_christian_yes/the_bible_christianity_and_homosexuality_justin_cannon.htm |archivedate=September 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the MCC, biblical texts interpreted by some as references to homosexuality refer only to specific sex acts and idolatrous worship which lack relevance to contemporary same-sex relationships.&lt;ref name="Rev1990"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Christians]] who support religious and legal recognition of same-sex marriage may base their belief in same-sex marriage on the view that marriage, as an institution, and the structure of the family is a biblical moral imperative that should be honored by all couples, heterosexual and homosexual alike. Supporting same-sex marriage reflects their Christ-like commitment to the equality and dignity of all people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaychurch.org/Gay_and_Christian_YES/Other%20articles/justified_through_Christ.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126093800/http://www.gaychurch.org/Gay_and_Christian_YES/Other%20articles/justified_through_Christ.htm |date=November 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gc2009.org/ViewLegislation/view_leg_detail.aspx?id=986&amp;type=Final|title=ページが見つかりません。|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wouldjesusdiscriminate.com/ |title=Would Jesus Discriminate? |publisher=Wouldjesusdiscriminate.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a theologian from the United Church of Canada, "human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, are a gift from God."&lt;ref name="EqualityRights2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology |title=Equality Rights |publisher=United Church of Canada |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313234743/http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/chronology |archivedate=March 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sergebac7thcentury.jpg|thumb|Historian [[John Boswell (historian)|John Boswell]] claims the 4th century Christian martyrs [[Saints Sergius and Bacchus|Saint Sergius and Saint Bacchus]] were united in the rite of [[adelphopoesis]], or brother-making, which he calls an early form of religious same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The Marriage of Likeness: Same-Sex Unions in Pre-Modern Europe (New York: Villard, 1994),&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Some same-sex married couples have challenged religious organizations that exclude them from access to public facilities maintained by those organizations, such as schools, health care centers, social service agencies, summer camps, homeless shelters, nursing homes, orphanages, retreat houses, community centers, and athletic programs.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=91486340|title=Gay Rights, Religious Liberties: A Three-Act Story|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of same-sex marriages have expressed concerns that this limits their religious freedoms.&lt;ref name=BannedInBoston&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/191kgwgh.asp|title=Banned in Boston|date=15 May 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, conservatives worry that a Christian college would risk its tax-exempt status by refusing to admit a legally married gay couple to married-student housing.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/10/us/10beliefs.html|title=Will Same-Sex Marriage Collide With Religious Liberty?|first=Peter|last=Steinfels|date=10 June 2006|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some legal analysts suggest that failure to reflect gay rights within their organizations may cost some religious groups their tax-exempt status.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/09/AR2009040904063.html|title=Faith Groups Increasingly Losing Legal Battles Over Gay Rights|first=Jacqueline L.|last=Salmon|date=10 April 2009|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious arguments for and against marriage rights for same-sex couples are not always evenly divided among theologically conservative religious groups and liberal groups.  While self-identified theological liberal organizations such as the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers), support same-sex marriage, other more conservative and or orthodox organizations including some [[Mennonite]] churches, the [[Church of the Brethren]], the [[Old Catholic Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/front/Church_agrees_to_bless_gay_partnerships.html?siteSect=105&amp;sid=6817696&amp;cKey=1150533957000&amp;ty=st |title=Church agrees to bless gay partnerships - SWI |publisher=Swissinfo.ch |date=2006-06-17 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Church of Sweden]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.se/8899/20071025/ |accessdate=September 29, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201090612/http://www.thelocal.se/8899/20071025/ |archivedate=December 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also support marriage rights for gay and lesbian persons.&lt;ref&gt;King, Michael A.

====Episcopal Church of the United States====
The [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] (as of 2015: 7,115 open parishes and missions; 2,009,084 active baptized members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.episcopalchurch.org/files/2013_table_of_statistics_0.pdf|title = Table of Statistics of the Episcopal Church|date = 2013|accessdate = 2015-07-02|website = Episcopal Church|publisher = Episcopal Church|last = |first = |format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;) at their 2009 [[General Convention of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|General Convention]] declared that: "bishops, particularly those in dioceses within civil jurisdictions where same-gender marriage, civil unions, or domestic partnerships are legal, may provide generous pastoral response to meet the needs of members of this Church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/11/30/episcopal_bishop_approves_priests_role_in_same_sex_marriages_in_eastern_mass/|title=Episcopal role OK’d in gays’ weddings|last=Paulson|first=Michael|date=November 30, 2009 |publisher=Boston Globe|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 9, 2012, the Episcopal Church passed a resolution that was to be voted on later to approve an official [[liturgy]] for blessing same-sex unions. This liturgy, called "''The Witnessing and Blessing of a Lifelong Covenant,''" would enable priests to bestow the church’s blessing on same-sex couples; priests could refuse to perform marriages, and bishops could prohibit same-sex marriage in their diocese. Denial would come without penalty, but the priest or diocese would have to direct same-sex couples they decline to another church or priest willing to perform the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = The Episcopal Church approves religious weddings for gay couples after controversial debate|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/07/01/why-the-episcopal-church-is-still-debating-gay-marriage/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-07-01|access-date = 2015-07-02|issn = 0190-8286|language = en|first = George|last = Conger|at = Para. 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution was confirmed on July 9, 2015 (three years later) on a 129 for and 26 against (with 5 abstaining) vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2015/07/episcopalians-vote-to-allow-same-sex-marriage-in-churches/2/|agency = Associated Press|title = Episcopalians Vote to Allow Same-Sex Wedding Ceremonies in Churches|first = Brady|last = McCombs|date = 2015-07-01|via = LGBTQ Nation|last2 = Zoll|first2 = Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metropolitan Community Church====
The [[Metropolitan Community Church]] (43,000 members) sees its mission being social as well as spiritual by standing up for the rights of minorities, particularly those of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people. MCC has been a leading force in the development of [[Queer theology]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward R. Gray, ''Gay religion By Scott Thumma'',  Alta Mira Press, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the MCC is notable for publicly supporting same-sex marriage as early as the 1960s. Notably in 1970 [[Troy Perry]], the church's founder, filed the first lawsuit in the U.S. seeking legal recognition for same-sex marriages. Perry lost that lawsuit but launched the debate over same-sex marriage in the U.S. Today, MCC congregations around the world perform more than 6000 same-sex marriage ceremonies annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hunt|first=edited by Stephen|title=Contemporary Christianity and LGBT sexualities|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Pub.|location=Farnham, Surrey, England|isbn=9780754676249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presbyterian Church USA====
The [[Presbyterian Church USA]] General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission ruled in 2006 that same-sex ceremonies are not forbidden, as long as they are not considered to be the same as marriage services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfn.org/2006/01/msg00291.html|title=wfn.org - [PCUSANEWS] Austin pastor won't be tried on gay 'marriage' accusation|website=www.wfn.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Debate on the issue within the church evolved over the years. In 2000, the General Assembly had approved language for the church constitution that stated church teachings were that people were "to live           either in fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman or in chastity in singleness.," and barred church officers and property from being used for blessing or approval upon any other form of fidelity relationship, but ratification for this language was never obtained by the presbyteries. By 2014, the General Assembly passed an Authoritative Interpretation permitting pastors to sign marriage licences for same-gender couples where permitted by civil law in the states where their church was found, which took immediate effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc-biz.org/PC-Biz.WebApp_deploy/(S(zbcely2njokyzcp51e0oharv))/IOBView.aspx?m=ro&amp;id=4599|title=PC-Biz|website=www.pc-biz.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 17, 2015, ratification by a majority of presbyteries was reached on a constitutional amendment passed by that same 2014 General Assembly, which broadened the definition of marriage in the Directory for Worship from only being between "a man and a woman," to "two people, traditionally a man and a woman," thus giving official sanction to, while not making it mandatory for, any congregation's pastor to preside over and bless marriage ceremonies for same-gender couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/us/presbyterians-give-final-approval-for-same-sex-marriage.html|title=Largest Presbyterian Denomination Gives Final Approval for Same-Sex Marriage|first=Laurie|last=Goodstein|date=17 March 2015|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Church of Christ====
The United Church of Christ's General Synod (998,906 members) passed a resolution affirming "equal marriage rights for all people regardless of gender" in 2005. The church allows but does not require pastors to perform same-sex weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====United Church of Canada====
The [[United Church of Canada]] (600,000 members) was active in the campaign that led to legal recognition of same-sex marriages in Canada. The United Church now allows individual congregations to decide whether or not to perform these marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/recognition |title=Equal Marriage Civil Recognition of Same-Sex Partnerships |publisher=United Church of Canada |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011081832/http://www.united-church.ca/humanrights/equal/recognition |archivedate=October 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, in the Protestant Church of the Netherlands, where same-sex marriages have been legal since 2001, individual congregations decide if they will perform them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians support religious and legal recognition of same-sex marriages based on a moral commitment to equality, or a belief that "human sexual orientations, whether heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, are a gift from God", as affirmed by the United Church of Canada's 37th General Council.&lt;ref name="EqualityRights2007"/&gt;

====Liberal Catholic theologians====
{{See also|Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism}}
Even within the Roman Catholic Church, there can be found a few a groups who support for same-sex marriage. For example, while the Vatican and most of the Roman Catholic hierarchy oppose same sex marriages, there are a few Catholic theologians who support gay marriages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiousconsultation.org/Catholic_defense_of_same_sex_marriage.htm|title=After 2 more deaths Planned Parenthood alters method for abortion pill (printer friendly)|website=www.religiousconsultation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critical biblical scholarship====
According to [[Daniel A. Helminiak]],&lt;ref&gt;Helminiak, Daniel A. (2000). ''What the Bible Really Says About Homosexuality: Millennium Edition.'' New Mexico: Alamo Square Press, pages 131-132.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bible]] may be interpreted literally or within historical-cultural context.  Under a literalist reading, the Bible can be read as condemning [[homosexuality]] (and, by extension, gay marriage).&lt;ref name="Helminiak, Daniel A. 2000 page 131"&gt;Helminiak, Daniel A. (2000). ''What the Bible Really Says About Homosexuality: Millennium Edition.'' New Mexico: Alamo Square Press, chapter nine: Summary and conclusion, page 131&lt;/ref&gt;  Read in cultural context, the Bible "was not addressing our current questions about sexual ethics and does not condemn gay sex [or gay marriage]s as we understand it today."&lt;ref name="Helminiak, Daniel A. 2000 page 131"/&gt; Helminiak argues that Biblical passages said to be against homosexuality (and same-sex marriages) do not actually say anything against gay and lesbian sexual relationships or identity. "The sin of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]] was inhospitality, not homosexuality. [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] condemns sex with [[angels]], not sex between two men. Not a single Bible text indisputably refers to lesbian sex. [...] there follows no valid conclusion whatsoever about homosexuality. Biblical figures [...] may well have been involved in homogenital relationships, seen as part of God's plan. And Jesus himself said nothing at all about homosexuality, not even when face to face with a man in a gay relationship."&lt;ref name="Helminiak, Daniel A. 2000 page 131"/&gt; [[Lisa Miller (journalist)|Lisa Miller]] also argues for a move beyond [[Biblical literalism|literalism]]. The Bible was written for a world unlike our own.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, D.S. (1975). ''Homosexuality and the Western Christian Culture.'' Anchor Books: Hamdon, CT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bratcher, Dennis (2006). "Community and Testimony: Cultural Influence in Biblical Studies" in ''The Voice: Biblical and Theological Resource for Growing Christians.''[http://www.crivoice.org/community.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monogamy]], for example, only became the norm in the [[Christian]] world in the last 150 years or so.&lt;ref&gt;Lim, Israel C.S.

===Hindus===
{{See also|Homosexuality and Hinduism}}
There are both conservative and liberal views about homosexuality and same-sex marriages in [[Hinduism]], similar to many other religions.  A liberal view is presented by Mathematician Shakuntala Devi, in her 1977 book, ''The World of Homosexuals'', in which she interviewed Srinivasa Raghavachariar, head priest of the Srirangam temple. He said that same-sex lovers must have been cross-sex lovers in a former life. The sex may change but the soul retains its attachments, hence the love impels these souls towards one another.&lt;ref&gt;"It started in 1977 with the publication of a book by a woman who is better known as a mathematician. Shakuntala Devi's The World of Homosexuals can be said to have inaugurated social-reformist homophilic Indian writing in English. She concluded her book by calling for not only the decriminalisation of homosexuality in India, but also its 'full and complete acceptance' by the heterosexual population so that the Indian homosexual may lead a dignified and secure life." Arvind Narrain and Gautam Bhan (eds). (2005) [http://intersections.anu.edu.au/issue14/chatterjee_review.html ''Because I Have a Voice: Queer Politics in India.''] New Delhi: Yoda Press. Devi, Shakuntala (1977). ''The World of Homosexuals'', Delhi: Vikas, (p. 155).&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002, Ruth Vanita (writer/reporter for ''GALVA - The Gay and Lesbian Vaishnava Association, Inc.'') interviewed a Shaiva priest who performed the marriage of two women; having studied Hindu scriptures, he had concluded, "Marriage is a union of spirits, and the spirit is not male or female" (p.&amp;nbsp;147).&lt;ref&gt;Vanita, Ruth (2006). [http://www.galva108.org/lovesrite.html ''Love’s Rite: Same-Sex Marriage in India and the West'']&lt;/ref&gt;

As Amara Das Wilhelm, a Krishna devotee and founder of GALVA, notes in his book, ''Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex'', "several Gaudiya Vaishnava authorities emphasize that since everyone passes through various forms, genders and species in a series of lives, we should not judge each other by the material body but view everyone equally on a spiritual plane, and be compassionate as God is."&lt;ref&gt;Das Wilhelm, Amara (2004). [http://www.galva108.org/galvabook.html ''Tritiya-Prakriti: People of the Third Sex - Understanding Homosexuality, Transgender Identity and Intersex Conditions Through Hinduism.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ruth Vanita, "Indian newspapers, over the last 25 years, have reported several same-sex weddings and same-sex joint suicides, mostly by Hindu female couples in small towns, unconnected to any gay movement. Several weddings took place by Hindu rites, with some family support, while the suicides resulted from families forcibly separating lovers." According to Vanita, the phenomena of increased visibility of same-sex weddings "...suggest the wide range of Hindu attitudes to homosexuality today. The millennia-long debate in Hindu society, somewhat suppressed in the colonial period, has revived. In 2004, Hinduism Today reporter Rajiv Malik asked several Hindu swamis (teachers) their opinion of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;http://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=1300&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The swamis expressed a range of opinions, positive and negative. They felt free to differ with each other; this is evidence of the liveliness of the debate, made possible by the fact that Hinduism has no one hierarchy or leader. As Mahant Ram Puri remarked, "We do not have a rule book in Hinduism. We have a hundred million authorities."&lt;ref&gt;Vanita, Ruth (2008).

===Views regarding Church-State separation===
Many supporters of same sex marriages argue&lt;ref name=Glassman&gt;Glassman, Anthony. (July 15, 2005).

[http://www.southsidepride.com/2004/04/articles/gaymarriage.html "Freedom of religion and gay marriage"] in ''Southside Pride: Phillips/Powderhorn/Nokomis/Riverside.''&lt;/ref&gt; that, by defining the institution of marriage as between one man and one woman, the state automatically tramples upon the constitutional rights to freedom of religion.  They argue that just because a majority of religious organizations may believe that gay marriages should not be granted by the state does not make it the state's obligation to observe their opinions on this matter.&lt;ref name="atheism.about.com"&gt;Cline, A. [http://atheism.about.com/od/gaymarriage/a/MarriageSacred.htm "Arguments Against Gay Marriage: Marriage is a Sacred Religious Sacrament Gay Marriage Would Be a Sacrilege and Thus Must Be Banned?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Amendment to the [[United States Constitution]], which is part of the [[United States Bill of Rights]], expressly forbids laws being made "respecting an establishment of religion" and that prohibit the free exercise of religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_Am1.html|title=U.S. Constitution - Amendment 1 - The U.S. Constitution Online - USConstitution.net|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment01/01.html#1|title=U.S. Constitution - FindLaw|website=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, according to this argument, the state has no authority to define marriage as between one man and woman because there are various religions which hold that gay marriage is morally equivalent to heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref name = Glassman/&gt;&lt;ref name = Dix/&gt;

[[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] prominently expresses concern that heterosexual-only marriage laws impose a specific religious doctrine as state policy. According to them, "a marriage amendment in the Constitution [raises] important church-state and religious liberty concerns."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.au.org/site/PageServer?pagename=issues_marriage Americans United for Separation of Church and State.

====Catholic Church opposition====
{{See also|Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism}}
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] argues from a theological perspective against recognizing same-sex unions.  According to Catholic moral doctrine, acts of sexual intimacy are only proper between a man and a woman within wedlock.  Secular government recognition of any other union within the definition of "marriage" would therefore reflect a belief in the moral equivalence of acts between a husband and wife and acts between two men or two women; this belief is contrary to Catholic doctrinal teaching.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Catholic opponents also argue that inclusion of same-sex unions within the definition of marriage would also evidence rejection of the idea that, in general, it is best that children be raised by their biological mother and father, and that it is the community's interest in ensuring the well-being of children is the sole basis for the government's licensee and involvement in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, ''Considerations Regarding Proposals to Give Legal Recognition to Unions between Homosexual Persons'' (2003) [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20030731_homosexual-unions_en.html] (visited January 20, 2008) (statement by Vatican department charged with promoting and safeguarding the doctrine on the faith and morals throughout the Catholic world).&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Views in Scripture=====
{{See also|The Bible and homosexuality}}
Within the [[Christian]] tradition, religious objections to same-sex marriages are often based upon the [[Bible]].

Some religious arguments against same-sex marriage are based upon [[Old Testament]] [[bible|biblical]] passages such as [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 19:4-11, [[Leviticus]] 18:22, and [[Leviticus]] 20:13,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxytoday.org/articles2/GagnonHomosexuality.php |title=Robert Gagnon - The Bible and Homosexual Practice: An Overview of Some Issues |publisher=Orthodoxytoday.org |date=2010-02-02 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref_a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2004/september/11.36.html |title=What God Hath Not Joined |publisher=Christianity Today |date=2004-09-01 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianfamilylawassociation.org/same-sex_relationships |title=A Christian Perspective on Same-Sex RelationshipsNeither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor reviler, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 |publisher=Christian Family Law Association |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nosamesexmarriage.com/marriage/bible_verses.php|title=The Bible and No Same Sex Marriage|website=nosamesexmarriage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others are based upon [[New Testament]] [[bible|biblical]] passages such as [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1, [[I Corinthians]] 6:8-10, and [[Epistle of Jude|Jude]] 1:7.&lt;ref name="ref_a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref" /&gt;  [[Conservatism|Conservative]] Christians note that the book of [[Leviticus]] contains a prohibition against male-male sexuality.  While the Biblical passages mentioned above do not define the institution of marriage, [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2:22-24 reads as follows:  "Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man. The man said, 'This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called 'woman,' for she was taken out of man.' For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and they will become one flesh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=genesis+2:22-24&amp;version=31|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 2:22-24 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt; This passage is quoted by [[Jesus]] in the [[New Testament]] [[Gospel]] of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+19:4-5;&amp;version=31;|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 19:4-5 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evangelical opposition====
According to Reverend [[Rick Warren]], a pastor of the conservative [[Evangelical Christian]] [[Saddleback Church|Saddleback]] [[megachurch]], homosexuals are people who "think they are smarter than God" and who choose "to disobey God's sexual instructions."&lt;ref name=Warren&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/news/2008/12/rick-warren-transcript.aspx|title=Steven Waldman Interviews Rick Warren|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Warren’s point of view, marriage is an ordinance from God that unites a man and a woman.&lt;ref name=Warren /&gt; [[James Dobson]], in ''[[Marriage Under Fire]]'' and elsewhere, argues that legalization for or passive tolerance of same-sex marriages would widen the definition of families.

The [[ex-gay movement]] takes the view that I Corinthians 6:9-11 offers Christian believers [[Sexual orientation change efforts|freedom from the sin of homosexual behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exodus.to/content/view/313/87/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901081023/http://exodus.to/content/view/313/87/ |archivedate=2009-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.messiah.edu/~chase/h/articles/art1.htm|title=freeministry.org - This website is for sale! - freeministry Resources and Information.|website=home.messiah.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evangelical author and counselor [[Joe Dallas]] notes that the Biblical passages relating to homosexual behavior uniformly prohibit that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joedallas.com/resources/Relevance%20&amp;R.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Churches====
{{Main|Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Same-sex marriage}}
The [[Orthodox Church in America]]&lt;ref name="OnMarriage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oca.org/DOCmarriage.asp?SID=12&amp;ID=26|title=On Marriage, Family, Sexuality, and the Sanctity of Life|publisher=Orthodox Church in America|accessdate=2006-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; is also opposed to same-sex marriage, as is the [[Unification Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/asia/Unification_Church_pres_sees_smaller_mass_weddings_77510.shtml Unification Church pres sees smaller mass weddings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322013906/http://www.monitor.co.ug/artman/publish/asia/Unification_Church_pres_sees_smaller_mass_weddings_77510.shtml |date=2009-03-22 }}, [[The Monitor (Uganda)]], 2008-12-30, "Moon said the church does not give its wedding blessing to same sex couples."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (15 million members) believes that marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that children are entitled to be raised by a mother and a father who honor their marital vows with complete fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]&lt;/ref&gt;  They believe marriage is not primarily a contract between individuals to ratify their affections and provide for mutual obligations, but is an important part of rearing children.  They teach that same-sex marriage undermines the purpose of marriage.&lt;ref name="TheDivine" /&gt;

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (8.2 million members) believes God condemns sexual activity that is not between a husband and his wife.  They teach that while the bible condemns homosexual acts, it does not condone hatred of homosexuals or homophobia.&lt;ref&gt;http://hwww.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/questions/bible-about-homosexuality/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orthodox Judaism===
{{See also|LGBT topics and Judaism}}
Judaism, like Christianity, reflects differing views between conservative and liberal adherents.  [[Orthodox Judaism]] maintains the traditional Jewish bans on both sexual acts and marriage amongst members of the same sex. The Orthodox Union in the United States supported a federal Constitutional amendment  banning same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Tzvi Hersh Weinreb, Orthodox Response to Same-Sex Marriage, NY Jewish Week (Mar. 26, 2004) http://www.ou.org/public_affairs/article/ou_resp_same_sex_marriage/ (visited January 20, 2008); Rabbinical Council of America, Joining with Three Other Orthodox Organizations, RCA Opposes Redefinition of Marriage in New York State (June 21, 2007) http://www.rabbis.org/news/index.cfm?type=policies (visited January 20, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note that recent research by Chana Etengoff &amp; Colette Daiute suggest that positive reconciliations between sexual minority individuals and Orthodox Jewish family members is possible (a process referred to as theistic mediation),&lt;ref&gt;Etengoff, C. &amp; Daiute, C. (2014). Family Members’ Uses of Religion in Post–Coming-Out Conflicts With Their Gay Relative. Psychology of Religion and Spirituality. 6(1), 33-43. doi: 10.1037/a0035198&lt;/ref&gt; both with and without clinical support.&lt;ref&gt;Etengoff, C. &amp; Daiute, C., (2015). Clinicians’ perspectives of religious families’ and gay men’s negotiation of sexual orientation disclosure and prejudice, Journal of Homosexuality, 62(3), 394-426. doi: 10.1080/00918369.2014.977115&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theravada Buddhists===
{{See also|LGBT topics and Buddhism}}
Thai [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhists]] (over 150 million members), being the more conservative wing of Buddhism are less supportive of gay rights and marriages. Human rights issues have received poor attention in Theravada countries, as the culture is rooted in the belief in the Law of Karma, which is more popular among Thai Buddhists than philosophical and advanced scriptural studies in Buddhism. Many monasteries and monks advocate their lay followers to see the world through the lens of karma, i.e., every person is born to pay back their sins. According to their explanations, all homosexuals and sexual deviants were once offenders of the Third Precept (prohibiting sexual misconduct) - at least in their past lives, and they must pay off their past sins in their present life. Therefore, they deserve all that society gives to them. This belief system creates strong conservative values in Theravada Buddhist culture. For these reasons, it is unlikely that Buddhists will easily approve a law to allow gay marriage. Gay and lesbian activists in Thailand will probably not be as successful as their fellows in European countries or Canada.&lt;ref name = Mettanando/&gt; It is important to note, however, that Theravada Buddhists outside of the South-East Asian Area, are generally more supportive, or neutral, to same-sex marriage, and LGBT rights as a whole.

== Freedom of religion ==
One source of controversy is how same-sex marriage affects [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/talk/2008/06/gay_marriage_conflict_between_1.html|title=Gay Marriage: Conflict Between Equal Rights and Religious Freedom?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is concern that religious communities might not be legally able to decide what type of marriages to solemnize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pewforum.org/events/?EventID=216|title=A Clash of Rights? Gay Marriage and the Free Exercise of Religion|date=21 May 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some same-sex married couples have challenged religious organizations that exclude them from access to public facilities maintained by those organizations, such as schools, health care centers, social service agencies, summer camps, homeless shelters, nursing homes, orphanages, retreat houses, community centers, and athletic programs.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; Opponents of same-sex marriage have expressed concerns that this limits their religious freedoms.&lt;ref name=BannedInBoston /&gt;  For example, conservatives worry that a Christian college would risk its tax-exempt status by refusing to admit a legally married gay couple to married-student housing.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Some legal analysts suggest that failure to reflect gay rights within their organizations may cost some religious groups their tax-exempt status.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;  In addition, religious opponents of same-sex marriage express concern about several specific instances in which they contend that religious freedoms have been abridged due to legal recognition of same-sex unions, including (a) an incident in Canada (which is subject to a different set of [[Same-sex marriage in Canada|laws concerning same-sex marriage]] than the United States), in which the Knights of Columbus were sued for declining to allow a same-sex wedding reception on their property;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianchristianity.com/cgi-bin/na.cgi?nationalupdates/050209lesbian]&lt;/ref&gt; (b) removal of real property tax exemption from a New Jersey Christian organization that did not allow a civil union ceremony to be performed on their property;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/new_jersey_attacks_religious_freedom_of_methodist_campground/|title=New Jersey attacks religious freedom of Methodist campground|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (c) requirements that judges and justices of the peace perform same-sex wedding ceremonies;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglican-mainstream.net/2008/04/08/legalizing-gay-marriage-will-spark-lawsuits-against-churches/]&lt;/ref&gt; and (d) the forced closing of Catholic adoption agencies which refused to place children in the homes of married same-sex partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=30209]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/same-sex_marriage_law_forces_d.c._catholic_charities_to_close_adoption_program/|title=Same-sex ‘marriage’ law forces D.C. Catholic Charities to close adoption program|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a concern that religious people might be marginalized for their beliefs about marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=16199|title=New Hampshire law marginalizes supporters of traditional marriage, bishop says|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/04/07/DI2009040702538.html|title=Same-Sex Marriage: Opposing Views|first=David Catania and Brian|last=Brown|date=7 April 2009|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Opponents point to the way [[Carrie Prejean]] was treated during the [[Miss USA 2009 controversy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/30/miss-california-carrie-pr_0_n_193503.htmlMiss|title=California Carrie Prejean To Campaign Against Gay Marriage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also concerns about violence and intimidation against religious people.  After a vote to make same-sex marriage illegal in California, same-sex marriage supporters published names of donors to the bill and classified them based on religion and many religious symbols were targeted.  Elder [[Dallin H. Oaks]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, likened the attacks against religious people to voter intimidation against black people during the American civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/news-releases-stories/religious-freedom|title=Transcript of Elder Dallin H. Oaks Speech on Religious Freedom|date=13 October 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some governments have made special provisions for religious protections within the texts of same-sex marriage laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/23/us/23beliefs.html|title=Same-Sex Marriage Laws Pose Protection Quandary|first=Peter|last=Steinfels|date=22 May 2009|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Americans United for Separation of Church and State]] argue that by defining marriage as an opposite-sex institution, the state infringes upon the constitutional right to freedom of religion.&lt;ref name="Glassman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dix"/&gt;&lt;ref name="atheism.about.com"/&gt; In this view, religious groups that do wish to celebrate same-sex marriages are discriminated against when government policies do not permit their religious groups to celebrate marriages as they see fit.

In [[literature]], a '''serial''' is a printing format by which a single larger [[Work of art|work]], often a work of [[Narrative|narrative fiction]], is published in smaller, sequential ''installments''. The installments are also known as ''numbers'', ''parts'' or ''fascicles'', and may be released either as separate [[Publication|publications]] or within sequential issues of a [[periodical publication]], such as a magazine or newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Dictionary of Nineteenth-Century Journalism|last1= Law|first1= Graham|editor1-first= Laurel|editor1-last= Brake|editor2-first= Marysa|editor2-last= Demoor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVrUTUelE6YC&amp;printsec=frontcover|chapter= Serials and the Nineteenth-Century Publishing Industry|year= 2009|publisher= Academia Press|location= London|isbn= |page= 567|chapterurl= https://books.google.com/books?id=qVrUTUelE6YC&amp;pg=PA567|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==
The growth of moveable type in the 17th century prompted episodic and often disconnected narratives such as ''[[L'Astrée]]'' and ''[[Artamène|Le Grand Cyrus]]''. At that time, books remained a premium item, so to reduce the price and expand the market, publishers produced large works in lower-cost installments called fascicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hagedorn|first=Roger|title=Technology and Economic Exploitation: The Serial as a Form of Narrative Presentation|journal=Wide Angle: A Film Quarterly of Theory, Criticism and Practice|year=1988|volume=10|issue=4|pages=4–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 19th and early 20th centuries ==
Serialized fiction surged in popularity during Britain's [[Victorian era]], due to a combination of the rise of literacy, technological advances in printing, and improved economics of distribution.&lt;ref name=Law&gt;{{cite book |title= Serializing Fiction in the Victorian Press |last= Law |first= Graham |year= 2000 |publisher= Palgrave |location= New York &amp; Hampshire, UK |isbn= 0-312-23574-7|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dOuhyJIJkUMC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=serial+fiction+victorian+graham+law&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vF6kToWdEqXo0QHN9oSfBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=serial%20fiction%20victorian%20graham%20law&amp;f=false | accessdate= October 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}} Most [[Victorian novels]] first appeared as installments in monthly or weekly periodicals.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;{{rp|13}} The wild success of [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', first published in 1836, is widely considered to have established the viability and appeal of the serialized format within periodical literature.  During that era, the line between "quality" and "commercial" literature was not distinct.&lt;ref name=Law/&gt;{{rp|31}} Other famous writers who wrote serial literature for popular magazines were [[Wilkie Collins]], inventor of the [[detective fiction|detective novel]] with ''[[The Moonstone]]'' and Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], who created the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories originally for serialization in ''[[Strand Magazine|The Strand]]'' magazine.

While American periodicals first syndicated British writers, over time they drew from a growing base of domestic authors. The rise of the periodicals like ''[[Harper's Magazine|Harper's]]'' and the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' grew in symbiotic tandem with American literary talent. The magazines nurtured and provided an economic sustainability for writers, while the writers helped grow the periodicals' circulation base. During the late 19th century, those that were considered the best American writers first published their work in serial form and then only later in a completed volume format.&lt;ref name=Lund&gt;{{cite book |title= AMERICAS CONTINUING STORY An Introduction to Serial Fiction, 1850-1900 |last= Lund |first= Michael |year= 1993 |publisher= Wayne State University Press |location=Detroit |isbn= 0-8143-2401-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=dOuhyJIJkUMC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=serialized+fiction+victorian+&amp;ots=VywkLjckG4&amp;sig=XUtZjmFc3-LidHeTA8yBNt6UYRI#v=onepage
| accessdate= October 23, 2011}} As [[Scribner's Monthly]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} As a piece in ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'' explained in 1878, "Now it is the second or third rate novelist who cannot get publication in a magazine, and is obliged to publish in a volume, and it is in the magazine that the best novelist always appears first."&lt;ref name=Lund/&gt;{{rp|52}} Among the American writers that wrote in serial form were [[Henry James]] and [[Herman Melville]]. A large part of the appeal for writers at the time was the broad audiences that serialization could reach, which would then grow their following for published works. One of the first significant American works to be released in serial format is ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'', by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], which was published over a 40-week period by ''[[The National Era]]'', an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851 issue.

Serialization was so standard in American literature that authors from that era often built installment structure into their creative process. James, for example, often had his works divided into multi-part segments of similar length.&lt;ref name=Lund/&gt;{{rp|30}} The consumption of fiction during that time was different than in the 20th century. Instead of being read in a single volume, a novel would often be consumed by readers in installments over a period as long as a year, with the authors and periodicals often responding to audience reaction.&lt;ref name=Lund/&gt;

In France, [[Alexandre Dumas]] and [[Eugène Sue]] were masters of the serialized genre. ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'' and ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'' each appeared as a ''[[feuilleton]]''. ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' was stretched out to 139 installments. Eugène Sue's serial novel ''Le Juif errant'' increased circulation of ''Le Constitutionnel'' from 3,600 to 25,000. Production in book form soon followed and serialization was one of the main reasons that nineteenth-century novels were so long. Authors and publishers kept the story going if it was successful since authors were paid by line and by episode. [[Gustave Flaubert]]'s ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' was serialized in ''[[La Revue de Paris]]'' in 1856.

Some writers were prolific. Alexandre Dumas wrote at an incredible pace, oftentimes writing with his partner twelve to fourteen hours a day, working on several novels for serialized publication at once. However, not every writer could keep up with the serial writing pace. [[Wilkie Collins]], for instance, was never more than a week before publication. The difference in writing pace and output in large part determined the author's success, as audience appetite created demand for further installments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books: A Living History|year=2011|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9781606060834|pages=153–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[German-speaking countries]], the serialized novel was widely popularized by the weekly family magazine ''[[Die Gartenlaube]]'', which reached a circulation of 382,000 by 1875.&lt;ref name = Belgum1&gt;Kirsten Belgum: "Domesticating the Reader: Women and Die Gartenlaube" in: ''Women in German Yearbook 9'' (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1993) {{ISBN|0-8032-9754-8}} pp. 92-93&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, ''[[The Russian Messenger]]'' serialized [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' from 1873 to 1877 and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' from 1879 to 1880. In Poland, [[Bolesław Prus]] wrote several serialized novels: ''[[The Outpost (Prus novel)|The Outpost]]'' (1885–86), ''[[The Doll (novel)|The Doll]]'' (1887–89), ''[[The New Woman]]'' (1890–93), and his sole [[historical novel]], ''[[Pharaoh (novel)|Pharaoh]]'' (the latter, exceptionally, written entire over a year's time in 1894–95 and serialized only after completion, in 1895–96).

In addition, works in late [[Qing dynasty]] China had been serialized. ''[[The Nine-tailed Turtle]]'' was serialized from 1906 to 1910.&lt;ref name=WangDeweip181&gt;[[David Der-wei Wang|Wang, David Der-wei]].

== Late 20th and early-21st centuries ==
With the rise of broadcast—both radio and [[television series]]—in the first half of the 20th century, printed periodical fiction began a slow decline as newspapers and magazines shifted their focus from entertainment to information and news. However, some serialization of novels in periodicals continued, with mixed success.

The first several books in the ''[[Tales of the City]]'' series by [[Armistead Maupin]] appeared from 1978 as regular installments in San Francisco newspapers. Similar serial novels ran in other city newspapers, such as ''[[The Serial]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pacificsun.com/marin_a_and_e/book_reviews/article_3f9b2c1e-65b4-11e2-9dd9-001a4bcf6878.html|title=That '70s book|publisher=Pacific Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1976; [[Marin County]]), ''Tangled Lives'' (Boston), ''Bagtime'' (Chicago), and ''Federal Triangle'' (Washington, D.C.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915212,00.html |title=The Press: Soap Operas Come to Print |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 8, 1977 |accessdate=February 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1984, [[Tom Wolfe]]'s ''[[The Bonfire of the Vanities]]'', about contemporary New York City, ran in 27 parts in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', partially inspired by the model of Dickens. The magazine paid $200,000 for his work, but Wolfe heavily revised the work before publication as a standalone novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ragen|first=Brian Abel|title=Tom Wolfe: A Critical Companion|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, CT:|isbn=0-313-31383-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander McCall Smith]], author of ''[[The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency]]'' series, experimented in 2004 with publishing his novel ''[[44 Scotland Street]]'' in instalments every weekday in ''[[The Scotsman]]''. [[Michael Chabon]] serialized ''[[Gentlemen of the Road]]'' in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' in 2007.

The emergence of the [[World Wide Web]] prompted some authors to revise a serial format. [[Stephen King]] experimented with ''[[The Plant]]'' (2000), and [[Michel Faber]] allowed ''The Guardian'' to serialise his novel ''[[The Crimson Petal and the White]]''. In 2005, [[Orson Scott Card]] serialized his out-of-print novel ''[[Hot Sleep]]'' in the first issue of his online magazine, ''[[InterGalactic Medicine Show]]''. In 2008 McCall Smith wrote a serialized online novel ''[[Corduroy Mansions]]'', with the audio edition read by [[Andrew Sachs]] made available at the same pace as the daily publication. In 2011, [[pseudonym]]ous author Wildbow published ''[[Worm (web serial)|Worm]]'', which remains one of the most popular web serials of all time.&lt;ref name="Beacon-Villager"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maynard.wickedlocal.com/article/20150702/NEWS/150709367|title=Adam Sherman of Maynard publishes web serial|first=Jesse|last=Collings|publisher=Wicked Local}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Star"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/opinion/online-exclusive/reading-revolution/2014/02/20/discipline-and-determiniation/|title=Discipline and determination pay off for webserial writer|date=20 February 2014|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.patreon.com/Wildbow|title=Wildbow is creating Web serials|publisher=[[Patreon]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of [[fan fiction]] on the internet also follows a serial fiction style of publication, as seen on websites such as [[FanFiction.Net]] and [[Archive of Our Own#Archive of Our Own|Archive of Our Own (AO3)]].

Many aspiring authors also used the web to publish free-to-read works in serialized format independently as well as web-based communities such as [[LiveJournal]], Fictionpress.com,&lt;ref&gt;[http://fictionpress.com Fictionpress.com]&lt;/ref&gt; fictionhub,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://fictionhub.io|title = fictionhub|date = |accessdate = |website = fictionhub|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wattpad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wattpad.com Wattpad]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these books receive as many readers as successful novels; some have received the same number of readers as New York Times bestsellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Many Books Do You Need To Sell To Become A Bestseller?|url=http://www.bookpromotionhub.com/6103/how-many-books-do-you-need-to-sell-to-become-a-bestseller/|website=www.bookpromotionhub.com|publisher=book promotion hub|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wildbow.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/monthly-views-june.jpg|website=wildbow.wordpress.com|title=Thoughts: A Reflection on growth over two years|date=26 June 2013|accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the prevalence of mobile devices made the serial format even more popular with the likes of JukePop Serials&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jukepopserials.com/ JukePop Serials]&lt;/ref&gt;, and Serial Box&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/8/6/16849756/serial-box-serialized-books-peak-tv|title=Meet a new kind of book, designed for the age of Peak TV|work=Vox|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.serialbox.com/|title=Serial Box is the Newest Medium for Series Drama|website=www.serialbox.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with iOS&lt;ref&gt;[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/free-serial-stories-jukepop/id579377848?mt=8 JukePop Serials] (iOS)&lt;/ref&gt; and Android&lt;ref&gt;[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jukepop&amp;hl=en JukePop Serials] (Android)&lt;/ref&gt; apps that focuses entirely on curating and promoting serialized novels.

'''Spotlight Singapore'''&lt;ref name="ssc"&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/spotlightsingapore/ Spotlight Singapore Facebook Page]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[cultural diplomacy]] platform that serves as a gateway to emerging and growth-leading markets Singapore. The first five editions of Spotlight Singapore were managed by the former The Old Parliament House Limited (TOPH). The Spotlight Singapore brand was transferred to The RICE Company Limited (TRCL) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.therice.sg/ |title=The RICE Company Limited Official Site &lt;/ref&gt;, an arts and creative not-for-profit organisation in 2014 and is currently managed by TRCL’s subsidiary, Global Cultural Alliance &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalculturalalliance.sg/ |title=Global Cultural Alliance Official Site &lt;/ref&gt;  from 2015. Spotlight Singapore combines artistic, economic and educational activities, with the objective of creating understanding, [[dialogue]] and [[sustainable]] collaborations between the arts and business communities of Singapore and her counterparts.&lt;ref name="ssc"/&gt;

Spotlight Singapore began as an international showcase for Singapore artists and their works. The programme subsequently grew to become a "business-friendly" event utilising  [[cultural diplomacy]].&lt;ref name="AO"&gt;{{Cite web |last = Cheah |first = Ui-Hoon |authorlink = |coauthors = |title = Building business with 'cultural diplomacy'  |work=[[AsiaOne]] |location= |date = |url = http://www.asiaone.com/Business/SME%2BCentral/Talking%2Bpoint/Story/A1Story20080604-68882.html |doi = |accessdate = November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It began in 2006 in [[Hong Kong]] as a cultural exchange programme,&lt;ref name="CD"&gt;{{Cite web |last = |first = |authorlink = |coauthors = |title = "Spotlight Hong Kong" kicks off in Singapore |work=[[People's Daily]] |location= |date = |url = http://english.people.com.cn/200702/03/eng20070203_347304.html |doi = |accessdate = November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and travelled to [[Tokyo]] in December 2006 with a business element introduced.&lt;ref name="ssc" /&gt; By the third edition, which was held in [[Moscow]] in June 2008, Spotlight Singapore had an intensive 4-day cultural-business programme that introduced the Russian capital to Singapore's lifestyle, and enabled the delegates to meet and seek out business opportunities while developing friendship with their counterparts through the exchange of cultures.&lt;ref name="ssc"/&gt;

In 2011, Spotlight Singapore hosted the programme in [[South Africa]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://capetown.spotlightsg.com/index.php |title=Spotlight Singapore: Cape Town |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With plans to venture into the European markets, [[Bratislava]] and [[Prague]], capital cities of [[Slovakia]] and the [[Czech Republic]] respectively, were chosen as Spotlight Singapore's fifth destination in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bratislava-prague.spotlightsg.com/ |title=Spotlight Singapore: Bratislava-Prague |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Spotlight Singapore held its sixth edition in Mexico City.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3597">The '''Symphony No. 6''' is the sixth [[symphony]] by the American composer [[William Schuman]].  The work was commissioned by the Dallas Symphony League and was given its world premiere by the [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]] under the conductor [[Antal Doráti]] on February 27, 1949.&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{cite web |last=Schuman |first=William |authorlink=William Schuman |year=1948 |title=Symphony No. 6 |publisher=[[G.

==Composition==
The symphony has a duration of roughly 27 minutes and is composed in one continuous [[Movement (music)|movement]].

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for a large orchestra comprising three [[Western concert flute|flutes]], two [[oboe]]s, [[Cor anglais|English horn]], two [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], two percussionists, and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
Though the world premiere was poorly received by its Dallas audience,&lt;ref name="Naxos" /&gt; the piece has since been praised by music critics.  Andrew Clements of ''[[The Guardian]]'' praised the symphony, remarking:{{quote|Schuman's music fits comfortably into the mould of mid-century American symphonism, and the edginess of Stravinskian neoclassicism is never far away.  Yet at its best his works have moments of grandeur that are distinctly their own, and with its dark colouring and troubled undertow the Sixth Symphony, first performed in 1949, is one of his most impressive achievements on an architectural and emotional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Clements |first=Andrew |title=Schuman: Symphony No 6; New England Triptych, etc: Seattle SO/Schwarz |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=November 26, 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/nov/27/schuman-symphony-no-6 |accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The work was similarly praised by Lawrence A. Johnson of the ''Chicago Classical Review'' who wrote:{{quote|Schuman was not a tunesmith and this is not music that is easy to love.  Astringent, densely woven and knottily contrapuntal, the music seems to reflect a damaged world haunted by the devastation of the war.  Jagged shards of military fanfares and a breakout timpani solo burst out and the agitated fugal writing builds to a frenetic climax.  Yet the prevailing mood is one of elegiac bleakness with slow, searching music framing the symphony, which closes with a slow ebbing away in an expression of exhausted despair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Lawrence A. |title=Slatkin and CSO pack the house for a successful (and rare) American program |work=Chicago Classical Review |date=April 18, 2014 |url=http://chicagoclassicalreview.com/2014/04/slatkin-and-cso-pack-the-house-for-a-successful-and-rare-american-program/ |accessdate=April 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Tate Modern''' is a [[modern art]] gallery located in London. It is Britain's national gallery of international modern art and forms part of the [[Tate]] group (together with [[Tate Britain]], [[Tate Liverpool]], [[Tate St Ives]] and [[Tate Online]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/|title=History and development ''Tate On-line''|work=Tate Etc.|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based in the former [[Bankside Power Station]], in the [[Bankside]] area of the [[London Borough of Southwark]]. Tate holds the national collection of British art from 1900 to the present day and international modern and contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about|title=About|work=Tate Etc.|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tate Modern is one of the [[list of largest art museums|largest]] museums of modern and contemporary art in the world. As with the UK's other national galleries and museums, there is no admission charge for access to the collection displays, which take up the majority of the gallery space, while tickets must be purchased for the major temporary exhibitions.

==History==

===Bankside Power Station===
{{main article|Bankside Power Station}}
[[File:Tate modern london 2001 03.jpg|thumb|250px|The Turbine Hall]]
Tate Modern is housed in the former [[Bankside Power Station]], which was originally designed by Sir [[Giles Gilbert Scott]], the architect of [[Battersea Power Station]], and built in two stages between 1947 and 1963. It is directly across the river from [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. The power station closed in 1981.

Prior to redevelopment, the power station was a {{Convert|200|m|abbr=on}} long, [[steel frame]]d, brick [[Cladding (construction)|clad]] building with a substantial central chimney standing {{Convert|99|m|abbr=on}}. The structure was roughly divided into three main areas each running east-west – the huge main [[Turbine Hall]] in the centre, with the [[Mechanical room|boiler house]] to the north and the switch house to the south.

===Initial redevelopment===
For many years after closure Bankside Power station was at risk of being demolished by developers.  Many people campaigned for the building to be saved and put forward suggestions for possible new uses. An application to [[listed building|list]] the building was refused. In April 1994 the [[Tate]] Gallery announced that Bankside would be the home for the new Tate Modern. In July of the same year, an international competition was launched to select an architect for the new gallery. Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron of [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]] were announced as the winning architects in January 1995. The £134&amp;nbsp;million conversion to the Tate Modern started in June 1995 and completed in January 2000.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/local/10439829.Tate_Modern_builders_win___400m_Battersea_Power_Station_contract/|title=Tate Modern builders Carillion win £400m Battersea Power Station contract|publisher=Your local Guardian|date=23 May 2013|accessdate=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most obvious external change was the two-story glass extension on one half of the roof. Much of the original internal structure remained, including the cavernous main turbine hall, which retained the overhead travelling crane. An [[electrical substation]], taking up the Switch House in the southern third of the building, remained on-site and owned by the French power company [[EDF Energy]] while Tate took over the northern Boiler House for Tate Modern's main exhibition spaces.

[[File:Panoramic view from Tate Modern balcony.JPG|300px|thumb|Panoramic view from Tate Modern balcony]]
The history of the site as well as information about the conversion was the basis for a 2008 documentary ''Architects Herzog and de Meuron: Alchemy of Building &amp; Tate Modern''. This challenging conversion work was carried by [[Carillion]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Opening and initial reception===
Tate Modern was opened by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] on 11 May 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/8/newsid_2519000/2519069.stm|title=2000: Sneak preview of new Tate Modern|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tate Modern received 5.25&amp;nbsp;million visitors in its first year. The previous year the three existing Tate galleries had received 2.5&amp;nbsp;million visitors combined.&lt;ref name="artreview"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Tate Modern. Nought to Sixteen. A History|journal=Art Review|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extension project===

Tate Modern had attracted more visitors than originally expected and plans to expand it had been in preparation since 2004. These plans focused on the south west of the building with the intention of providing 5,000m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of new display space, almost doubling the amount of display space.&lt;ref name=guide&gt;Tate Guide, August–September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/projects/tate-modern-project/vision|title=Vision|work=Tate Etc.|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern third of the building was retained by the French power company [[EDF Energy]] as an [[electrical substation]]. In 2006, the company released the western half of this holding&lt;ref name="EDF"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/arts/design/26tate.html|title=Tate Modern Announces Plans for an Annex|work=The New York Times|date=26 July 2006|accessdate=26 July 2006|first=Alan|last=Riding}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plans were made to replace the structure with a tower extension to the museum, initially planned to be completed in 2015. The tower was to be built over the old oil storage tanks, which would be converted to a performance art space. Structural, geotechnical, civil, and façade engineering and environmental consultancy was undertaken by [[Ramboll]] between 2008 and 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tate Modern extension|url=http://www.ramboll.com/projects/ruk/tate-modern|accessdate=22 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This project was initially costed at £215&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2285488,00.html Tate Modern's chaotic pyramid], ''[[The Times]]'', 26 July 2006. Retrieved 26 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the money raised, £50&amp;nbsp;million came from the UK government; £7&amp;nbsp;million from the [[London Development Agency]]; £6&amp;nbsp;million from philanthropist [[John Studzinski]]; and donations from, among others, the Sultanate of Oman and [[Elisabeth Murdoch (businesswoman)|Elisabeth Murdoch]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah Nayeri (20 April 2012), [http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-04-20/murdoch-s-daughter-elisabeth-gives-tate-at-least-1-dot-6-mln Murdoch’s Daughter Elisabeth Gives Tate at Least $1.6 Mln]''[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, international shipping and property magnate [[Eyal Ofer]] pledged £10m to the extension project, making it to 85% of the required funds. Eyal Ofer, chairman of London-based Zodiac Maritime Agencies, said the donation made through his family foundation would enable "an iconic institution to enhance the experience and accessibility of contemporary art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pickford |first=James |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/73bfec0c-e32f-11e2-bd87-00144feabdc0.html |title=Eyal Ofer donates £10m to Tate Modern extension |work=Financial Times |date=2 July 2013 |accessdate=12 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tate director, Nicholas Serota, praised the donation saying it would help to make Tate Modern a "truly twenty-first-century museum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Brown, arts correspondent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/02/tate-modern-gift-eyal-ofer |title=Tate Modern receives £10m gift from Israeli shipping magnate Eyal Ofer &amp;#124; Art and design |work=The Guardian |date= 2 July 2013|accessdate=12 January 2014 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Tanks====
The first phase of the expansion involved the conversion of three large, circular, underground oil tanks originally used by the power station into accessible display spaces and facilities areas. These opened on 18 July 2012 and closed on 28 October 2012&lt;ref name="artreview"/&gt; as work on the tower building continued directly above. They reopened following the completion of the Switch House extension on 17 June 2016.

Two of the Tanks are used to show live [[performance art]] and installations while the third provides utility space.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt; Tate describes them as "the world's first museum galleries permanently dedicated to live art".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tanks-tate-modern/eventseries/tanks-art-action|title=The Tanks: Art in Action|work=Tate Etc.|accessdate=8 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104132030/http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tanks-tate-modern/eventseries/tanks-art-action|archivedate=4 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Switch House====
[[File:Tate Modern Switch House (27633103611).jpg|thumb|Exterior of the Switch House]]
A ten-storey tower, 65 metres high from ground level, was built above the oil tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/file/tate-modern-project-environmental-statement-non-technical-summary|title=Environmental Statement non-technical summary|work=Tate Etc.|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original western half of the Switch House was demolished to make room for the tower and then rebuilt around it with large gallery spaces and access routes between the main building and the new tower on level 1 (ground level) and level 4. The new galleries on level 4 have natural top lighting. A bridge built across the turbine hall on level 4 to provides an upper access route.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

The new building opened to the public on 17 June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/special-event/new-tate-modern-opening-weekend|title=The new Tate Modern opening weekend – Special Event at Tate Modern|website=Tate Etc.|access-date=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design, again by [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]], has been controversial. It was originally designed with a glass stepped pyramid, but this was amended to incorporate a sloping façade in brick latticework (to match the original power-station building)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=10122|title=Tate Modern extension redesigned|publisher=Worldarchitecturenews.com|date=18 July 2008|accessdate=8 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite planning consent to the original design having been previously granted by the supervising authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning_decisions/strategic_dev/2007/20070509/tate_modern_bankside_report.pdf|title=Tate Modern extension, Bankside|publisher=Greater London Authority|accessdate=25 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819083439/http://legacy.london.gov.uk/mayor/planning_decisions/strategic_dev/2007/20070509/tate_modern_bankside_report.pdf|archive-date=19 August 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extension provides 22,492 square metres of additional gross internal area for display and exhibition spaces, performance spaces, education facilities, offices, catering and retail facilities as well as a car parking and a new external public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inexhibit.com/case-studies/tate-modern-expansion-herzog-de-meuron/|title=Tate Modern extension by Herzog &amp; de Meuron architects|publisher=Inexhibit|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017 the Switch House was formally renamed the Blavatnik Building, after Anglo-Ukrainian billionaire Sir [[Leonard Blavatnik]], who contributed a "substantial" amount of the £260m cost of the extension.  Sir Nicholas Serota commented "Len Blavatnik's enthusiastic support ensured the successful realisation of the project and I am delighted that the new building now bears his name".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Ellis-Petersen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/may/04/tate-modern-names-extension-after-oligarch-donor-len-blavatnik |title=Tate Modern names extension after billionaire Len Blavatnik &amp;#124; Art and design |work=The Guardian |accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Galleries==
The collections in Tate Modern consist of works of international modern and [[contemporary art]] dating from 1900 until today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern|title=Tate Modern|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levels 2, 3 and 4 contain gallery space. Each of those floors is split into a large east and west wing with at least 11 rooms in each. Space between these wings is also used for smaller galleries on levels 2 and 4. The Boiler House shows art from 1900 to the present day.&lt;ref name="map"&gt;Tate Modern Visitor Map June 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Switch House has eleven floors, numbered 0 to 10. Levels 0, 2, 3 and 4 contain gallery space. Level 0 consists of the Tanks, spaces converted from the power station's original fuel oil tanks, while all other levels are housed in the tower extension building constructed above them. The Switch House shows art from 1960 to the present day.&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;

The Turbine Hall is a single large space running the whole length of the building between the Boiler House and the Switch House. At six stories tall it represents the full height of the original power station building. It is cut by bridges between the Boiler House and the Switch House on levels 1 and 4 but the space is otherwise undivided. The western end consists of a gentle ramp down from the entrance and provides access to both sides on level 0. The eastern end provides a very large space that can be used to show exceptionally large artworks due its unusual height.

==Exhibitions==

=== Collection exhibitions ===
[[File:Tate.modern.interior.london.arp.jpg|thumb|right|A gallery at Tate Modern.]]
The main collection displays consist of 8 areas with a named theme or subject. Within each area there are some rooms that change periodically showing different works in keeping with the overall theme or subject. The themes are changed less frequently. There is no admission charge for these areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern#visit|title=Tate Modern|last=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of June 2016 the themed areas were:&lt;ref name="map"/&gt;
* ''Start Display'': A three-room display of works by major artists to introduce the basic ideas of modern art.
* ''Artist and Society''
* ''In The Studio''
* ''Materials and Objects''
* ''Media Networks''
* ''Between Object and Architecture''
* ''Performer and Participant''
* ''Living Cities''

There is also an area dedicated to displaying works from the [[Artist Rooms]] collection.

==== History of the collection exhibitions ====
[[File:Tate Modern.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Chimney of Tate Modern. The ''Swiss Light'' at its top was designed by [[Michael Craig-Martin]] and the architects [[Herzog &amp; de Meuron]] and was sponsored by the Swiss government. It was dismantled in May 2008.]]

Since the Tate Modern first opened in 2000, the collections have not been displayed in chronological order but have been arranged thematically into broad groups. Prior to the opening of the Switch House there were four of these groupings at a time, each allocated a wing on levels 3 and 5 (now levels 2 and 4).

The initial hanging from 2000 to 2006:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/tate-modern-collection-2000|title=Tate Modern: Collection 2000 – Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/tate-modern-collection-2003|title=Tate Modern: Collection 2003 – Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''History/Memory/Society''
* ''Nude/Action/Body''
* ''Landscape/Matter/Environment''
* ''Still Life/Object/Real Life''

The first rehang at Tate Modern opened in May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/tate-modern-launches-first-major-rehang-its-collection-support-ubs|title=Tate Modern launches first major rehang of its Collection with the support of UBS – Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/CollectionDisplays?venueid=2|archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080316122625/http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/CollectionDisplays?venueid=2|dead-url=yes|archive-date=16 March 2008|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT] UK Government Web Archive – The National Archives|first=Internet Memory|last=Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; It eschewed the thematic groupings in favour of focusing on pivotal moments of twentieth-century art. It also introduced spaces for shorter exhibitions in between the wings. The layout was:

The Turbine hall, which once housed the electricity generators of the old power station, is five storeys tall with 3,400 square metres of floorspace.&lt;ref name="the_guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/arts/features/story/0,11710,1587112,00.html|title=Profile: Rachel Whiteread|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=7 October 2005|accessdate=20 April 2006|first=Xan|last=Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to display large specially-commissioned works by contemporary artists, between October and March each year. 

From 2000 until 2012, the series was named after its corporate sponsor, [[Unilever]].

In 2013, Tate Modern signed a sponsorship deal worth around £5&amp;nbsp;million with [[Hyundai]] to cover a ten-year program of commissions, then considered the largest amount of money ever provided to an individual gallery or museum in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;xMartin Bailey (20 January 2014), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tate-signs-m-sponsorship-with-Hyundai/31578 Tate signs £5m sponsorship with Hyundai] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140122185549/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Tate-signs-m-sponsorship-with-Hyundai/31578 |date=22 January 2014 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The first commission for the Hyundai series is Mexican artist, [[Abraham Cruzvillegas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/hyundai-commission-2015-abraham-cruzvillegas|title=Hyundai Commission 2015: Abraham Cruzvillegas|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is no series running, the Turbine Hall is used for occasional events and exhibitions. In 2011 it was used to display [[Damien Hirst]]'s ''[[For The Love of God]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/damien-hirsts-iconic-love-god-be-shown-tate-moderns-turbine-hall|title=Damien Hirst's iconic For the Love of God to be shown in Tate Modern's Turbine Hall|work=Tate Etc.|date=21 November 2011|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a sell out show by [[Kraftwerk]] in February 2013 crashed the ticket hotline and website, causing a backlash from the band's fans.

====Major temporary exhibitions====
Two wings of the Boiler House are used to stage the major temporary exhibitions for which an entry fee is charged. These exhibitions normally run for three or four months. When they were located on a single floor, the two exhibition areas could be combined to host a single exhibition. This was done for the [[Gilbert and George]] retrospective due to the size and number of the works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/gilbert-george|title=Gilbert &amp; George – Tate|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the two wings used are on level 3. It is not known if this arrangement is permanent. Each major exhibition has a dedicated mini-shop selling books and merchandise relevant to the exhibition.

A 2014 show of [[Henri Matisse]] provided Tate Modern with London's best-attended charging exhibition, and with a record 562,622 visitors overall, helped by a nearly five-month-long run.&lt;ref&gt;Javier Pes and Emily Sharpe (2 April 2015), [http://theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/17584/ Visitor figures 2014: the world goes dotty over Yayoi Kusama] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420033842/http://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/museums/17584/ |date=20 April 2015 }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, [[Joan Jonas]] had a retrospective exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/mar/13/joan-jonas-review-tate-modern|title=Joan Jonas review – post-internet confusion before the internet|date=13 March 2018|work=The Guardian|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Tanks====
The Tanks, located on level 0, are three large underground oil tanks, connecting spaces and side rooms originally used by the power station and refurbished for use by the gallery. One tank is used to display installation and video art specially commissioned for the space while smaller areas are used to show installation and video art from the collection.

====Project Space====
The Project Space (formerly known as the Level 2 Gallery) was a smaller gallery located on the north side of the Boiler House on level 1 which housed exhibitions of contemporary art in collaboration with other international art organisations. Its exhibitions typically ran for 2–3 months and then travelled to the collaborating institution for display there. The space was only accessible by leaving the building and re-entering using a dedicated entrance. It is no longer used as gallery space.

====Other areas====
Works are also sometimes shown in the restaurants and members' rooms. Other locations that have been used in the past include the mezzanine on Level 1 and the north facing exterior of the Boiler House building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/street-art|title=Street Art – Tate|accessdate=22 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other facilities==
In addition to exhibition space there are a number of other facilities:
* A large performance space in one of the tanks on level 0 used to show a changing programme of performance works for which there is sometimes an entrance charge.
* The Starr Auditorium and a seminar room on level 1 which are used to show films and host events for which there is usually an entrance charge.
* The Clore Education Centre, Clore Information Room and McAulay Studios on level 0 which are facilities for use by visiting educational institutions.
* One large and several small shops selling books, prints and merchandise.
* A cafe, an espresso bar, a restaurant and bar and a members' room.
* Tate Modern community garden, co-managed with [[Bankside Open Spaces Trust]]

== Access and environs ==
[[File:Wobbly bridge 120600.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tate Modern on the opening day of the [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]] in 2000]]
The closest station is [[Blackfriars station|Blackfriars]] via its new south entrance. Other nearby stations include [[Southwark tube station|Southwark]], as well as [[St. Paul's tube station|St Paul's]] and [[Mansion House tube station|Mansion House]] north of the river which can be reached via the [[Millennium Bridge (London)|Millennium Bridge]]. The lampposts between Southwark tube station and Tate Modern are painted orange to show pedestrian visitors the route.

There is also a [[Thames Clippers|riverboat]] pier just outside the gallery called [[Bankside Pier]], with connections to the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] and [[Greenwich]] via regular passenger boat services (commuter service) and the Tate to Tate service, which connects Tate Modern with Tate Britain.

To the west of Tate Modern lie the sleek stone and glass Ludgate House, the former headquarters of [[Express Newspapers]] and [[Sampson House]], a massive late [[Brutalist]] office building.

==Controversies==

===''Liberate Tate'' from BP===
Since 2010 there have been 14 protest [[Performance art|art performances]] by the art collective ''[[Liberate Tate]]'' demanding the Tate to "disengage from [[BP]] as a sponsor, and stop allowing Tate to be used to deflect attention away from the devastating impacts that BP has around the world." BP is criticised for operations in relation with [[Petroleum exploration in the Arctic]], the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], [[Oil sands]] and [[climate change]]. The artists involved in the protests are referring to a deal between BP and the Tate: BP pays £224,000 a year to the Tate. The Tate presents the brand BP in return. In June 2015 a group of artists occupied Tate Modern for 25 hours.&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/14/tate-modern-climate-activists-bp-protest Climate activists leave Tate Modern after all-night protest against BP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'’[https://liberatetate.wordpress.com/liberating-tate/open-letter-to-nicholas-serota/ Liberate Tate]'’&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Testament and Death of Moses''''' is a fresco attributed to the Italian Renaissance painters [[Luca Signorelli]] and [[Bartolomeo della Gatta]],  executed in around 1482 and located in the [[Sistine Chapel]], [[Rome]].

==History==
On 27 October 1480 a group of Florentine painters left for Rome, where he had been called as part of the reconciliation project between [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the ''de facto'' ruler of [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], and [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The Florentines started to work in the [[Sistine Chapel]] as early as the Spring of 1481, along with [[Pietro Perugino]], who was already there. Neither Bartolomeo della Gatta nor Luca Signorelli (who was thirty at the time) appear in the official contracts signed between the Papal court and the painters, but they were most likely among the assistants of Perugino, who was the general superintendent of the works. Signorelli is mentioned in the Sistine Chapel after his master left in 1482, as the author of the ''Disputation over Moses' Body'' on the entrance wall (repainted by [[Matteo da Lecce]] in 1574 due to its poor state).
[[File:Signorelli, testamento e morte di mosè 03.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Detail of the fresco.]]
It has been supposed that Perugino provided at least the layout of the fresco, while its realization, basing on a comment by [[Giorgio Vasari]], had been assigned traditionally to Signorelli. Studies by art historians such as [[Mario Salmi]], reduced Signorelli's presence in the work, and attributed most of the painting to Bartolomeo della Gatta, a painter influenced by the purity of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the early Perugino.

The theme of the decoration was a parallel between the Stories of Moses and those of Christ, as a sign of continuity between the [[Old Testament|Old]] and the [[New Testament]]. A continuity also between the divine law of the Tables and the message of Jesus, who, in turn, chose Peter (the first alleged bishop of Rome) as his successor: this would finally result in  a legitimation of the latter's successors, the popes of Rome.

==Description==
The fresco portrays the last episode in Moses' life, in two sectors: a foreground one including two scenes, and a background one, with three further scenes and, on the right, a landscape. Moses is always recognizable through his yellow garments and the green cloak, as in the rest of the cycle. The artist made an extensive use of gold painting.

On the background Moses, on the [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]], receives by an angel the command baton, which gives him the authority to lead the Israelites towards the [[Promised Land]]. Below, Moses descends from the mountain with the baton in his hand, similarly to [[Cosimo Rosselli]]'s ''[[Descent from Mount Sinai (Sistine Chapel)|Descent from Mount Sinai]]'' nearby. In the foreground, on the right, is a 120-year-old Moses  speaking at the crowd while holding the baton and a Holy Book: rays of light stem from his head. At his feet is the [[Ark of the Covenant]], opened to show the [[Twelve Tables]] and the vase of the [[Manna]]. In the center, the procession includes a woman holding a child on her shoulders, wearing silk,  an elegant youth portrayed from behind and a naked man sitting. The latter two characters are attributed to Luca Signorelli, as well as the man with a stick next the throne of Moses.

On the left is the appointment of [[Joshua]] as Moses' successor; the former kneels to receive the command baton, while the prophet has  his cloak opened, showing a red-lined interior. Finally, on the left background, is the corpse of Moses on a shroud, surrounded by the dismayed Israelites.

'''''The Abandoned Soldier''''' is a sculpture created in 2007 by sculptor James Napier that was modelled after British ex-soldier Lance Corporal Daniel Twiddy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-25/edition-1/big-picture-abandoned-soldier]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sculpture ''The Abandoned Soldier'' (TAS) was made for the [[BBC]] documentary ''Power to the People'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/power_to_the_people/6613759.stm Power To The People: The Battle of Trafalgar Square] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; to be erected in Trafalgar Square, and made an appearance on Newsnight as well as the front page of the Independent newspaper. TAS was initially housed at [[Combat Stress]], a charitable organisation for ex-servicemen and women, before being moved with the help of the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers to the [[National Memorial Arboretum]] in Staffordshire to launch The Abandoned Soldier Project. The sculpture has subsequently been moved to Cardiff Castle, then to Exeter Castle for the War Art Exhibition in June 2011, and was filmed as part of a Channel 5 documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welshicons.org.uk/news/cardiff/cardiff-castle-welcomes-the-abandoned-soldier/ Cardiff Castle Welcomes The Abandoned Soldier] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121224155540/http://www.welshicons.org.uk/news/cardiff/cardiff-castle-welcomes-the-abandoned-soldier/ |date=2012-12-24 }} WelshIcons.org.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cardiffian.jomec.co.uk/article/forgotten-soldier-statue-erected-cardiff-castle Forgotten soldier statue erected by Cardiff Castle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131225935/http://cardiffian.jomec.co.uk/article/forgotten-soldier-statue-erected-cardiff-castle |date=2012-01-31 }} The Cardiffian&lt;/ref&gt; From there it was moved to the Rhondda Heritage Park at [[Trehafod]]. 

In April 2012, the sculpture was moved back to Cardiff Castle as a permanent 'base'. In the Summer of 2013, the head piece was removed from the base and taken on a tour of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/100933196@N03/sets/72157649153200768/]&lt;/ref&gt; The high points included; The summit of Mount Snowdon and Portmeirion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69WD1zeCcXU]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014 the sculpture was part of an installation by Themis Jones, installed at the Hay Festival of Literature and Art. In July 2014 he returned to his main 'base' at Cardiff Castle and will stand as a lasting reminder of the trauma of War, until 2018.

==Interpretation==
The statue was created in remembrance of soldiers who have suffered the after effects of armed conflict and are not being treated like the heroes they truly are.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-15533875 Garden of remembrance at heritage park to fallen troops] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; The sculpture was modelled after Lance Corporal Daniel Twiddy, who had been wounded in 2003 by friendly fire and shrapnel while in [[Basra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavgds.co.uk/assets/89/March_09_Newsletter.pdf The Abandoned Soldier] The Cavalry and Guards Club, 127 Newsletter, March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/02/12/sculpture-tribute-to-soldiers-hardship-91466-28158852/ Sculpture tribute to soldiers’ hardship] Wales Online&lt;/ref&gt; Twiddy had received several wounds from shrapnel, which included wounds to the face from a 'Blue on Blue' incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5034672.stm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rctbusinessclub.co.uk/7820.html Rhondda Heritage Park’s Garden of Remembrance 2011] Rhondda Heritage Business Club&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
In 2010 concerns were made over the stability of the sculpture and that the resin material might disintegrate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/memorial-sculpture-at-risk-of-crumbling-away-2133550.html Memorial sculpture at risk of crumbling away] Independent&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns were also raised about the sculpture's lack of a permanent display location. There have been attempts at petitioning for a more permanent location as well as fundraising efforts for a bronze version of the statue.

The sculpture now has a piece of music, commissioned by the TAS Project, written and sung by Bethan Myfanwy Hughes, a civilian trauma nurse and also a member of the Territorial Army.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fR-zgFcaE4U]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Birds''''' comprises a pair of outdoor sculptures depicting [[house sparrow]]s by [[Myfanwy MacLeod]], installed after the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Southeast False Creek Olympic Plaza, which served as the site of the [[2010 Olympic Village]] in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada.&lt;ref name=Globe&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/when-giant-sparrows-attack/article1211261/|title=When giant sparrows attack|date=May 15, 2010|accessdate=September 6, 2014|first=Marsha|last=Lederman|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaunted&gt;{{cite web|first=Tuija |last=Seipell |url=http://www.jaunted.com/story/2010/8/1/163512/4307/travel/Vancouver%92s+Coolest+Public+Art%3A+The+Birds+at+the+Olympic+Village |title=Vancouver’s Coolest Public Art: The Birds at the Olympic Village |publisher=Jaunted |date=August 3, 2010|accessdate=September 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work depicts one male and one female house sparrow, each approximately five metres tall, and was the first piece approved by the city's Olympic and Paralympic Public Art Program. It was inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s [[The Birds (film)|1963 film of the same name]], sustainability, the site's history as a shipyard, and immigration.

They were removed on November 23, 2017 for repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vancourier.com/news/olympic-village-s-giant-birds-headed-east-for-repairs-1.23103495|title=Olympic Village’s giant birds headed east for repairs|last=|first=|date=November 23, 2017 |work=Vancouver Courrier|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Sculpture of a sparrow in Olympic Village, Vancouver.jpg|thumb|left|upright|One of the house sparrows (2011)]]

''The Birds'' was the first work of public art to be approved under the city's Olympic and Paralympic Public Art Program.&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaunted/&gt; It was installed in Southeast False Creek Olympic Plaza, which served as the site of the [[2010 Olympic Village]], in April 2010.&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heavy&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://heavyindustries.ca/the-birds/|accessdate=September 7, 2014|publisher=Heavy Industries|title=the birds: the skinny by heavy industries}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacLeod was inspired by [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s [[The Birds (film)|1963 film of the same name]]. She has said of the piece, "I think it boils down to wanting to make something sublime for the plaza – that is something beautiful, but frightening at the same time."&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt; She has also said of its inspiration:

{{Quote|We have a very kind of romantic relationship to nature and I'm interested in playing with that romantic notion and kind of inverting it, sort of like how the birds attack in the film… And the scale of [the installation] has that similar effect, where our relationship to the birds has changed. Because normally when you're on the plaza, you see little birds and you're this giant thing. Here it's the opposite: You're the small thing in relationship to the giant birds.&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt;}}

''The Birds'' was also inspired by sustainability and the site's history as a shipyard, where sailors often wore sparrow tattoos. The sculptures have been called an "ode to immigration" based on MacLeod's interest in "alien species" and when non-native species are introduced to an environment (the house sparrow is not native to North America).&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaunted/&gt; MacLeod said: "My work for the Olympic Village tries to infuse the ordinary and commonplace sparrow with a touch of the ridiculous and the sublime. Locating this artwork in an urban plaza not only highlights what has become the 'natural' environment of the sparrow, it also reinforces the 'small' problem of introducing a foreign species and the subsequent havoc wreaked upon our ecosystems."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiandesignresource.ca/nature/the-birds-installation/|title=The Birds Installation – Vancouver, British Columbia|accessdate=September 7, 2014|publisher=The Canadian Design Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculptures were produced by Heavy Industries, with some bodywork completed by Semi-Rigid Plastic Parts Repair.&lt;ref name=Heavy/&gt; ''The Birds'' was the last of the public art program's works to be installed, despite being the first approved.&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Olympic Village, Vancouver (1).jpg|thumb|right|One of the sculptures in 2011]]

The work depicts one male and one female house sparrow, each between {{convert|4.5|and|5.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall,&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaunted/&gt; or approximately {{nowrap|50 times}} life size.&lt;ref name=Heavy/&gt; The birds have been described as realistic and "massive yet friendly-looking".&lt;ref name=Jaunted/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heavy/&gt; Their bodies are made from hard coated [[Polystyrene#Expanded_polystyrene|expanded polystyrene]] (EPS) foam, coated with a [[polyurea]] skin and airbrush painted, all clad around a steel armature. Their cast bronze legs were sealed with wax. According to Heavy, the EPS form pieces were "glued together with pressure-sensitive adhesive, specifically formulated for bonding EPS to itself and other materials".&lt;ref name=Heavy/&gt;

==Reception==
Marsha Lederman of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' called the sculptures "huge and intimidating and a bit creepy", but acknowledged the artist's intent.&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt; Explaining connection between immigration and sparrows specifically, she wrote that the birds were introduced "to satisfy cultural nostalgia for homesick Europeans. The birds were alien, exotic. They're now ubiquitous. Part of the everyday landscape. Barely noticed… Not these."&lt;ref name=Globe/&gt; Tuija Seipell of Jaunted said the sparrows were reminiscent of the bird that Flick and the Blueberries build to scare the Hoppers in the 1998 film ''[[A Bug's Life]]''.&lt;ref name=Jaunted/&gt;

'''The Eight Lancashire Lads''' was a troupe of young male [[Clog dance (British)|clog dancers]] who toured the [[music hall]]s of [[Great Britain]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Founders==
They were founded by Bill Cawley and J.W. (William) Jackson (1863–1940) of [[Wigan]], [[Lancashire]].  As they became more successful, they recruited other members such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], who got his first professional break with them at the age of ten.

==Former members==

* Brothers Richard, Eric and Clem White went to [[Sydney]], Australia in the 1910s and formed theatre companies including Edgley and Dawe. They had changed their names from White{{clarify|reason=Changed to what?|date=April 2018}} and the successful Australian theatrical empressarion [[Michael Edgley]] is descended from Eric Edgley. His brother, Richard White was for a period the choreographer of the female chorus at the [[New Tivoli Theatre, Sydney|Tivoli]] revue theatre in Sydney. Michael White (aka Wijaya) an exotic dancer and humorist, who has been resident in [[Bali]] since 1973, is Richard White's grandson.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

* Percy Joshua Norman (Pip) was also one the lads. He was in the troupe {{circa}} 1921. His wife Pat Norman is now 91 ({{as of|2013|3|16|lc=y}}) and living in Bradford. Also his son Chris Norman was in the band Smokie who had a lots of hits all over the world in the 1970s. Chris has had a solo career since the 1980s and is still touring and recording,{{when|date=April 2018}} he resides in the Isle of Man with his wife and family.

* Gabriel Winestein was another of the lads. Born in Leeds, Gabriel joined the troupe in about 1905.

'''''The Excursion to Tilsit''''' is a 1917 collection of short stories or novellas by the German writer [[Hermann Sudermann]]. Its German title is '''''Litauische Geschichten''''', which means "Lithuanian stories". The book consists of four stories set in rural Lithuania in the mid 19th century. It was published in English in 1930, translated by Lewis Galantière.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/excursion-to-tilsit/oclc/1474999|title=The excursion to Tilsit|work=[[WorldCat]]|accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several stories from the book have been adapted for film. Most famously, [[F. W. Murnau]]'s 1927 film ''[[Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans]]'' is loosely based on the titular story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fischer|first=Lucy|year=|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V96tee1l2q8C&amp;pg=PA75|chapter=Sunrise: A Tale of Two Humans|editor1-last=White|editor1-first=Rob|editor2-last=Buscombe|editor2-first=Edward|title=British Film Institute Film Classics, Volume 1|location=London; New York|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]; [[Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|Fitzroy Dearborn]]|page=75|isbn=1-57958-328-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Margaret Wallace of ''[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]'' wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Like [[Selma Lagerlöf]], and many other novelists whose material is national and even provincial, Sudermann by his very unconcern with cosmopolitan values gives a deeper truth and meaning to the lives of his characters. Of these four stories of Lithuanian peasants, only one, "Miks Bumbullis", depends for its effect upon purely national traits and circumstances. They are, for the most part, founded solidly upon the fundamental and inescapable human facts of birth and love and death. They are moving and tragic and, above all, intensely and vividly alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Wallace|first=Margaret|year=April 1930|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Bookman-1930apr-00214a03|title=''The Excursion to Tilsit'' by Hermann Sudermann|work=[[The Bookman (New York)|The Bookman]]|page=214-215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''[[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]]'' reviewed the book:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Excursion to Tilsit'' by Hermann Sudermann is a collection of powerful short stories dealing with the life of Lithuanian peasants. The author has observed them sympathetically and at first hand. Nominal Catholics, they still live in fear of pagan gods, giving even their lives to propitiate them. ... Among the stories, that of Jons and Erdma who, having built a home by tricks and cunning are tricked out of it at last by their daughters, compares favorably with [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgeniev's]] ''Lear of the Steppes'' as a story of faith and treachery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=1930-04-02|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Outlook-1930apr02-00544a02|title=The Leisure Arts: The Week's Reading|work=[[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]]|page=546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''The Lacemaker''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch artist]]  [[Johannes Vermeer]] (1632–1675), completed around 1669–1670 and held in the [[Louvre]], Paris. The work shows a young woman dressed in a yellow shawl, holding up a pair of bobbins in her left hand as she carefully places a pin in the pillow on which she is making her bobbin lace. At 24.5&amp;nbsp;cm x 21&amp;nbsp;cm (9.6 in x 8.3 in), the work is the smallest of Vermeer's paintings,&lt;ref name="B66"&gt;Bonafoux, 66&lt;/ref&gt; but in many ways one of his most abstract and unusual.&lt;ref name="H0538"&gt;Huerta (2005), 38&lt;/ref&gt; The [[canvas]] used was cut from the same bolt as that used for ''[[A Young Woman Seated at the Virginals]]'', and both paintings seem to have had identical dimensions originally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Canvas matches in Vermeer: a case study in the computer analysis of canvas supports  |url=http://people.ece.cornell.edu/johnson/LiedtkeMMJ.pdf|first1=Walter|last1=Liedtke|authorlink1=Walter Liedtke|first2=C.

The girl is set against a blank wall, probably because the artist sought to eliminate any external distractions from the central image. As with his ''[[The Astronomer (painting)|The Astronomer]]'' (1668) and ''[[The Geographer]]'' (1669), that the artist likely undertook careful study before he executed the work; the art of lacemaking is portrayed closely and accurately.&lt;ref name="W114"&gt;Wheelock, 114&lt;/ref&gt; Vermeer probably used a ''[[camera obscura]]'' while composing the work: many optical effects typical of photography can be seen, in particular the blurring of the foreground.&lt;ref name="B66" /&gt; By rendering areas of the canvas as out-of-focus, Vermeer is able to suggest [[depth of field]] in a manner unusual of Dutch [[Baroque painting]] of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Huerta (2003), 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Lacemaker'', the artist presents in an abstract manner the various elements which compose the girl's face and body and the pattern of the material on which she is working. The girl's hands, the curls of her hair and the T-cross which form her eyes and nose are all described in an abstract manner unusual for the era in which Vermeer worked. In addition, the red and white of the lace is shown as spilling from the sewing cushion with physical properties suggesting a near liquid form.&lt;ref name="H0538" /&gt; The blurring of these threads contrasts sharply with the precision of the lace she is shown working on.&lt;ref name="B66" /&gt;

[[File:"The Lace-Maker" by Caspar Netscher.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Lace Maker]]'' (1662) by [[Caspar Netscher]]. Although this work shares with Vermeer a sense of quiet solitude, it hints at sexual overtones unvisited by the later artist&lt;ref name="B66" /&gt;]]

Vermeer's painting is often compared to a 1662 canvas of the same name (but two words) by the Dutch portrait and genre painter [[Caspar Netscher]]. However, Vermeer's work is very different in tone. In the earlier work, both the girl's shoes and the mussel shells near her feet have sexual connotations.&lt;ref name="B66" /&gt; In addition, the discarded shoes in Netscher's painting are unlikely to be the girl's own, hinting again at a sexual overtone.&lt;ref&gt;Nash, John. ''Vermeer''. Scala, 1991. {{ISBN|1-870248-63-5}}. See extract: "[http://www.essentialvermeer.com/cat_about/lacemkr.html]".&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the art historian [[Lawrence Gowing]],
:"The achievement of Vermeer's maturity is complete. It is not open to extension: no universal style is discovered. We have never the sense of abundance that the characteristic jewels of his century gives us, the sense that the precious vein lies open, ready to be worked. There is only one 'Lacemaker': we cannot imagine another. It is a complete and single definition."&lt;ref&gt;Gowing, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Sly Old Cat''''' is a children's book written and illustrated by [[Beatrix Potter]] in 1906, and first published by Frederick Warne &amp; Co. in 1971, almost thirty years after her death. The story tells of a cat who invites a rat to a tea party with the intention of eating him, but the rat outwits her and leaves the party with a muffin in a paper bag.

The story was written in 1906 for her publisher's daughter, and was intended to be published in 1907 as a panorama book, a long strip of paper with text and illustrations that folded into a wallet. Booksellers objected to the format, because the item was too difficult to keep folded and in its place once customers opened it for examination. The tale was set aside. In 1916, it was again considered for publication but, again, set aside. Potter's eyesight was failing and she did not want to become involved in the labour of developing a book for publication. It was first published in 1971 with Potter's rough sketches. The book was critically well received.

==Plot==
A cat invites a rat to her tea party. She eats her bread and leaves only crumbs for the rat. She drinks her tea and leaves only drops of milk for the rat. The rat believes she will eat him for dessert and wishes he had not come. When the cat raises the milk jug to drink the last of the milk, the rat gives the jug a pat and it slips down over the cat's head. She bangs about the kitchen unable to free herself. The rat sips some tea, puts a muffin in a paper bag, and leaves. Later, he eats the muffin.

==Composition and publication==
Potter wrote the book in 1906 for her publisher's daughter, Nellie Warne. Publication was intended for 1907 as a companion piece to the panorama books, ''[[The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit]]'' and ''[[The Story of Miss Moppet]]'', but booksellers objected to the panorama format which was nothing more than a long paper strip of illustrations and text that folded accordion-fashion into a wallet and was tied with a ribbon. It was difficult to keep such a book folded and enclosed in its wallet after curious customers opened it for examination. The story was set aside.&lt;ref name="Taylor130"&gt;Taylor 1987, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916, the story was again considered for publication but in the standard small book format of the Peter Rabbit library rather than the panorama format.&lt;ref name="Lear280"&gt;Lear 2007, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; The title was announced on an [[endpaper]] as ''The Story of the Sly Old Cat'' but Potter's watercolours were never prepared for printing.  Her eyesight was failing and she did not look forward to the work involved in preparing the book for publication.  She suggested [[Ernest Aris]] for the job, but the book only reached a rough draft stage.  The story was first published in 1971 with Potter's rough sketches.  The book is not included in the standard small format library of 23 Peter Rabbit books.&lt;ref name="MacDonald50"&gt;MacDonald 1986, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical commentary==
''The Sly Old Cat'' is told mainly in monosyllables, and is critically considered "perfect in its fusion of word and picture, and visually reminiscent of [[Randolph Caldecott]] in its rythmic narrative flow."&lt;ref name="Taylor130"/&gt;

'''Sheikh Tosun Bayrak al-Jerrahi al-Halveti''' (January 21, 1926 &amp;ndash; 15 February 2018) was an author, translator and [[Sufi]].  He served as a government official in [[Ankara]], Honorary Consul of [[Turkey]] in [[Morocco]] and was the Sheikh of the [[Jerrahi]] Order in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fonsvitae.com/tosunbayrakibnarabi.html The Tree of Being] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516072115/http://www.fonsvitae.com/tosunbayrakibnarabi.html |date=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on February 15, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.alaturka.us/obituary-sufi-leader-tosun-bayraktaroglu/ Obituary: Sufi leader Tosun Bayraktaroglu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bayrak was born in [[Istanbul]] in 1926.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;Ahmet Sait Akcay, [https://www.aa.com.tr/en/culture-and-art/obituary-sufi-leader-tosun-bayraktaroglu/1069998 Obituary: Sufi leader Tosun Bayraktaroglu]. Andalou Agency, 21 February 2018. Accessed 28 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; During his childhood, he'd been raised without religion in the household, having rarely visited a mosque with his parents; his interest in Hindu and Buddhist philosopher during high school was one of his few experiences with religion.&lt;ref name=moth&gt;Matt Hanson, [https://www.dailysabah.com/arts-culture/2018/09/01/the-moth-and-the-flame-in-memory-of-tosun-bayrak The moth and the flame: In memory of Tosun Bayrak]. [[Daily Sabah]], 31 August 2018. Accessed 28 October 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in life, his grandfather helped to spark his interest in art and poetry with trips to museums as well as [[Topkapı Palace]].&lt;ref name=moth/&gt; Initially, he studied [[Biological Sciences]] at [[Robert College]], graduating in 1945.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; It was during his time in college that he first became exposed to Islam as a living practice, lodging on weekends with his aunt who prayed five times a day and fasted during [[Ramadan]].&lt;ref name=moth/&gt;

Bayrak later went on to study [[Art]], [[Architecture]], and [[Art History]] in the Studios of [[Fernand Léger]] and [[Andre Lhote]] in [[Paris]];&lt;ref name=moth/&gt; [[Architecture]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]];&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; and [[History of Art]] at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], [[London]]. While in London, he was an associate of poet [[Can Yücel]] and former [[Prime Minister of Turkey]] [[Bülent Ecevit]].&lt;ref name=moth/&gt; He received a Masters in Fine Arts from [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

===Sufism===
In 1970 Bayrak met [[Muzaffer Ozak]], who became his spiritual teacher, at the Jerrahi Lodge in Instanbul.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Rory Dickson, [https://books.google.com.sa/books?id=HCiLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=jerrahi+america&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjj0IvShLDeAhUMC8AKHfz9BuQQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=jerrahi%20america&amp;f=false Living Sufism in North America: Between Tradition and Transformation], p. 108. [[Albany, New York|Albany]]: [[SUNY Press]], 2015. {{ISBN|9781438457581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bayrak became a Sheikh of the Halveti-Jerrahi order and resided near the Jerrahi Order of America mosque in [[Spring Valley, New York]] a few years later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sufism.org/books/names.html#tosun The Most Beautiful Names]&lt;/ref&gt; He acted as the spiritual guide of the Jerrahi Order of the Americas starting from 1977,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forusa.org/fellowship/sep_oct_01/1001_13.html The Meaning of Age] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20040626145532/http://www.forusa.org/fellowship/sep_oct_01/1001_13.html |date=2004-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and he founded the official mosque of the Order's American branch in [[Chestnut Ridge, New York]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=moth/&gt; Though at one time an admirer of [[Fethullah Gülen]], Bayrak condemned the [[Gülen movement]] at a winter 2016 art exhibit in Istanbul due to the movement's alleged involvement in the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]].&lt;ref name=moth/&gt;

{{cquote|“Service should be from the moment you are born until the moment you give your last breath, but you have to find out in what way. That's what's most important. We have to find out in what manner we are supposed to serve.” &lt;ref&gt;"The World is Beautiful" An interview with Sheikh Tosun Bayrak al-Jerrahi [http://www.wie.org/j18/bayrak.asp?page=2]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response to the [[January 2015 Île-de-France attacks]], which ended as Bayrak was planning a Friday sermon, he declared that the perpetrators were insane, not Muslims, and opposed the key teachings of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Lerner and Richard Liebson, [https://www.lohud.com/story/news/local/2015/01/09/local-muslims-jews-horrified-terror-france/21530145/ Local Muslims, Jews horrified by terror in Paris]. [[The Journal News]], 9 January 2015. Accessed 1 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Bayrak passed away in New York on 15 February 2018 at the age of 92.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Works==
===Artisty===
Bayrak taught art and art history at [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]], where he helped to establish the Fine Arts Division.&lt;ref name=moth/&gt; His work was exhibited widely in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fonsvitae.com/tosunbayrakibnarabi.html The Tree of Being] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516072115/http://www.fonsvitae.com/tosunbayrakibnarabi.html |date=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and he became a [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim]] fellow in 1965.&lt;ref name=moth/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwisdom.com/Public/Authors/Detail.asp?AuthorID=97&amp;WhatType=1 Tosun Bayrak]&lt;/ref&gt;  He retired from the art world in the 1970s and devoted his life to the study and teaching of [[Islam]] and Sufism. 

{{cquote|“Both my wife and I were artists, and we felt very strongly that it was feeding our egos. Art, art exhibitions, and the consequences of being accepted and successful are incredible food for your ego, which is the Sufi's enemy. The final straw was when we went to Rome to visit a friend, a sculptor, and there was a very pretty young girl there whom my friend introduced me to. And she was so adoring to me. She said, "Ohhh, I know you. I love your art." She was completely praising me, and I saw the ego suddenly rise up and say, "Aha! This beautiful, spiritual girl is telling you that you are a great artist." So I said, "Oh, my God! That's it. It's over." I hit the ego on the head and decided I was finished with it all.&lt;ref&gt;"The World is Beautiful" An interview with Sheikh Tosun Bayrak al-Jerrahi [http://www.wie.org/j18/bayrak.asp?page=2]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Translation===
Bayrak translated dozens of books on Islamic spirituality, but he was particularly known for his efforts on the works of the Sufi mystic [[Ibn Arabi]]. One of his best known works is ''Ibn Arabi: The Tree of Being''. His translations of classic works of Sufism include [[Abdul Qadir Gilani]]'s ''Secret of Secrets'', ''Inspirations'', and ''The Book of Sufi Chivalry'', ''[[Suhrawardiyya|Suhrawardi]]: The Shape of Light'', ''The Name and the Named: Divine Attributes of God'', and [[Imam Birgivi]]'s ''The Path of Muhammad''.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''''Yosegi-zaiku'''''|寄木細工}} is a type of traditional Japanese [[marquetry]] which originated during Japan's culturally rich [[Edo period]]. It has become widely known and respected throughout the world. The mosaic work is made by making use of natural fine grains and textures of wood. Timbers of different colors are cut into oblong rods of desired sections. Spindle tree (''[[Euonymus]]'' spp.) and ''[[Ilex macropoda]]'' are used for white, aged Katsura tree (''[[Cercidiphyllum japonicum]]'') for black, ''[[Picrasma quassioides]]'', mulberry (''[[Morus alba]]'') and Chinese lacquer tree (''[[Toxicodendron vernicifluum]]'') for yellow, camphor tree (''[[Cinnamomum camphora]]'') and ''[[Maackia]]'' for brown, black walnut (''[[Juglans nigra]]'') for purple, Japanese cucumber tree (''[[Magnolia obovata]]'') for blue and Chinese cedar (''[[Toona sinensis]]'') for red.  The rods are then glued together to form the section of geometrical design pattern. The sectional surface is sliced into thin plates of wood, which are glued onto boxes and other handicraft works. To add to the glaze and sturdiness of the surface, finishing coatings of [[lacquer]] are applied.

Yosegi are commonly found on the outside of Japanese secret boxes  or [[Puzzle box|puzzle boxes]], but may also be used to create or decorate many other items such as trays, chests, jewellery boxes, vases, photo frames, drink coasters, etc.
