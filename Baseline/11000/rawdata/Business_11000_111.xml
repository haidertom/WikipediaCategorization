      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5632">In [[marketing]], '''abandonment rate''' is a term associated with the use of virtual [[Shopping cart software|shopping carts]]. Also known as "shopping cart abandonment". Although shoppers in [[brick and mortar]] stores rarely abandon their carts, abandonment of virtual shopping carts is quite common. Marketers can count how many of the shopping carts used in a specified period result in completed sales versus how many are abandoned. The abandonment rate is the ratio of the number of abandoned shopping carts to the number of initiated transactions&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics&gt;Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). ''Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance.'' Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. {{ISBN|0-13-705829-2}}. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in ''Marketing Metrics'' as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt; or to the number of completed transactions.&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;[[American Marketing Association]] Dictionary. {{cite web|url=http://www.marketingpower.com/_layouts/Dictionary.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121033809/http://www.marketingpower.com/_layouts/dictionary.aspx |archivedate=2012-11-21 }}. Retrieved 2012-11-29. The [[Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB)]] endorses this definition as part of its ongoing [http://www.commonlanguage.wikispaces.net/ Common Language in Marketing Project].&lt;/ref&gt; The typical shopping cart abandonment rate for online retailers varies between 60% and 80%, with an average of 67.91%.&lt;ref&gt;Baymard Institute. http://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate Retrieved 2014-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
There are various reasons behind the high cart abandonment rate. In general, these reasons can be categorized as different risks that affect the user's decision to ultimately complete the purchase. Below are reasons that were identified in an empirical study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kukar-Kinney|first=Monika|last2=Close|first2=Angeline G.|date=2010-04-01|title=The determinants of consumers’ online shopping cart abandonment|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11747-009-0141-5|journal=Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science|language=en|volume=38|issue=2|pages=240–250|doi=10.1007/s11747-009-0141-5|issn=0092-0703}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Complicated checkout process.
* Hidden prices that come out at the time of checkout like taxes or high shipping charge.
* Tough or lengthy registration process. No option to check out without signing up.
* Limited payment options.
* Decision to purchase from a land-based store (as opposed to online)
* Entertainment value (e.g. placing items for fun or because of boredom)
* Utilization as a research and organization tool
* Desire to wait for a lower/sale price
* Privacy/security concerns
* Non-delivery fear (e.g. product is lost in delivery)
* Difference in product description versus actual product

Another problem is that people have too many [[password]]s. A [[MasterCard]] and [[University of Oxford]] study in 2017 showed about a third of purchases were not made because the person could not remember a password.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/business/article156636084.html|title=Forgot your password? You have too many and stores are losing business over it|last=Johnson|first=Tim|work=[[Kansas City Star]]|date=June 16, 2017|accessdate=July 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
As a result, there are some implications that can be applied to online retails.
* Organizational use of cart
** Users often abandonment not because of dissatisfaction but as an organizational method. Even abandoned carts serve as a source of useful information for both consumers and retailers. Retailers can collect interest info of shopper's and use that information to better present purchases and improve throughput in the future. 
* Entertainment Value
** Consumers who use carts for fun or to alleviate boredom may still spread positive words about the online retailer and their experience, despite not completing the purchase.
* Concerns about price and overall cost
** Concerns about cost may not necessarily equate a lost sale, but rather an opportunity to make the sale in the future by offering a discount reminder whenever possible. A flat shipping rate may also positively influence the throughput versus a variable rate. Users will be more inclined to purchase more in one sitting as they no longer fear the need to pay excessive shipping.

==Purpose==
Abandonment rate as a marketing metric which helps marketers to understand website user behavior. Specifically, abandonment rate is defined as "the percentage of shopping carts that are abandoned" prior to the completion of the purchase.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;  This information is generally not used on a facility reservation report.

==Construction==
As an example, an online comics retailer found that of the 25,000 customers who loaded items into their electronic baskets, only 5,000 actually purchased:
* Purchases not completed = purchases initiated less purchases completed = 25,000 − 5,000 = 20,000.
* Abandonment rate = Not completed / Customer Initiation = 20,000 / 25,000 = 80% abandonment rate.&lt;ref name=Marketing_Metrics /&gt;

There are two [[professional association]]s responsible for regulation of [[accountancy]] in [[Portugal]].

==Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas==
'''Ordem dos Técnicos Oficiais de Contas''' (OTOC) runs an admittance [[Test (assessment)|examination]] every four months and everyone that passes it becomes a Técnico Oficial de Contas (TOC), the authorized tax and accountancy practitioner in Portugal.

OTOC, which is the largest Portuguese professional body, with more than 75,000 affiliates, offers a broad range of training programs to its members, and is an active member in the public discussion of accounting and finance issues.

==Ordem dos Revisores Oficiais de Contas==
'''Ordem dos Revisores Oficiais de Contas''' (OROC) confers the national qualification for auditors (ROC).

OROC is the national member of [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ifac.org/about/member-bodies IFAC members and associates]. Retrieved 2013-03-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmed Abdel Hadi Chalabi'''&lt;ref&gt;Sometimes transcribed as ''Ahmad al-Jalabi''.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ar|أحمد عبد الهادي الجلبي}}; 30 October 1944&amp;nbsp;– 3 November 2015) was an [[Iraqi people|Iraqi]] politician, a founder of the [[Iraqi National Congress]] (INC) and the [[Prime Minister of Iraq|President]] of the [[Iraqi Governing Council|Governing Council of Iraq]] ([[List of Prime Ministers of Iraq|37th]] [[Prime Minister of Iraq]])

He was interim Minister of Oil in [[Iraq]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/30/AR2005123001307.html|title=Chalabi Named Iraq Oil Minister|work=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April–May 2005 and December 2005 – January 2006 and Deputy Prime Minister from May 2005 to May 2006. Chalabi failed to win a seat in parliament in the December 2005 elections, and when the new Iraqi cabinet was announced in May 2006, he was not given a post. Once dubbed the "[[George Washington]] of Iraq"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New Republic]]'', "Are Foreign Rebel Leaders Duping The American Right, Again?", 11 August 2003&lt;/ref&gt; by American supporters, he later fell out of favor and came under investigation by several U.S. government sources.

In the lead-up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the Iraqi National Congress (INC), with the assistance of lobbying powerhouse [[BKSH &amp; Associates]],&lt;ref name="roston"&gt;Adam Roston, [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20080421/roston Chalabi's Lobby] ''The Nation'' 3 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; provided a major portion of the information on which [[Office of Special Plans|U.S. Intelligence]] based its condemnation of the Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]], including reports of [[weapons of mass destruction]] and alleged ties to [[al-Qaeda]]. Most, if not all, of this information has turned out to be false and Chalabi has been called a [[fabricator (intelligence)|fabricator]].&lt;ref name="prairieweather.typepad.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prairieweather.typepad.com/the_scribe/2006/09/9706_npr_michae.html|title=The Scribe|work=typepad.com|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent20151103&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ahmed-chalabi-politician-who-furnished-bush-and-blair-with-the-false-information-that-led-to-the-a6720136.html |title=Ahmed Chalabi: Politician who furnished Bush and Blair with the false information that led to the allied invasion of Iraq |last1=Salaheddin |first1=Sinan |date=3 November 2015 |website=www.independent.co.uk |access-date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with this, Chalabi also subsequently boasted, in an interview with the British ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', about the impact that their alleged falsifications had on American policy,&lt;ref name=Telegraph20040219&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1454831/Chalabi-stands-by-faulty-intelligence-that-toppled-Saddams-regime.html |title=Chalabi stands by faulty intelligence that toppled Saddam's regime |last1=Fairweather |first1=Jack |last2=La Guardia |first2=Anton |date=19 February 2004 |website=www.telegraph.co.uk |access-date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; — these factors led to a falling out between him and the U.S. government.&lt;ref name=Independent20151103 /&gt; Furthermore, Chalabi was found guilty in the [[Petra Bank]] scandal in [[Jordan]].

In January 2012, a French intelligence official stated that he believed Chalabi to be "acting on behalf of Iran".&lt;ref name=NYT20120125&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/world/middleeast/26iht-m26-bahrain-conflict.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all |title=In Bahrain, Worries Grow of Violent Shiite-Sunni Confrontation |last1=Mekhennet |first1=Souad |date=25 January 2012 |website=www.nytimes.com |access-date=12 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Chalabi was the son of a prominent [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] family,&lt;ref name="aljazeera-obit" /&gt; one of the wealthy power elite of [[Baghdad]].  He was born at [[Kadhimiya]] in 1944.  His family, who dated back 300 years to the Sultanate ran Iraq’s oldest commercial bank under the British-backed [[Kingdom of Iraq]].&lt;ref name="TE Chalabi"&gt;{{cite news|title=The unexpected end of the man who helped deceive America into war in Iraq|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21677550-unexpected-end-man-who-helped-deceive-america-war-iraq-ahmed|accessdate=5 November 2015|work=[[The Economist]]|date=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a wealthy grain merchant and member of the Iraqi parliament, became head of the senate when King Abdullah was assassinated.

His family retired from public life to a farmhouse near Baghdad when the military seized power.  Chalabi left Iraq with his family in 1958, following the [[14 July Revolution]],&lt;ref name="TE Chalabi" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "legacy"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-34713891 |first=Jim |last=Muir |title=Ahmed Chalabi death highlights Iraq war legacy |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=3 November 2015 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and spent most of his life in the United States and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name = "profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2291649.stm |title=Profile: Ahmed Chalabi |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=3 October 2002 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Baghdad College]] and [[Seaford College]] in Sussex, England before leaving for America.

=== Western education ===
In exile, following the Ba'ath party takeover, his family acted as the Iraqi Shia clergy’s bankers.&lt;ref name="TE Chalabi" /&gt;  In the mid-1960s, he studied with [[cryptography|cryptographer]] [[Whitfield Diffie]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] from which he received a [[bachelor of science]] degree in [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield Diffie and Susan Landau, ''Privacy on the Line: The Politics of Wiretapping and Encryption'', MIT Press, 1998, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, he earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in mathematics from the [[University of Chicago]] under the direction of [[George Glauberman]] on the Theory of Knots.&lt;ref&gt;Dissertation title: ''On the [[Jacobson radical|Jacobson Radical]] of a [[Group algebra|Group Algebra]]'', see {{MathGenealogy|6597}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which he took a position in the mathematics department at the [[American University of Beirut]]. He published three mathematics papers between 1973 and 1980, in the field of [[abstract algebra]].

In 1971, Chalabi married Leila Osseiran, daughter of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] politician [[Adil Osseiran]]. They had four children.&lt;ref name="Where Plan A"&gt;Dexter Filkins. [http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/03/africa/web.1103chalabi.php "Where Plan A left Ahmad Chalabi"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 3 November 2006.  Accessed 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Whilst still at Beirut the civil war broke out in 1975, so he moved to Jordan and found work as an interpreter.

== Business career ==
Chalabi was a bold and shrewd investor, amassing a fortune of $100 million.  During his life he was accused of corruption many times.  In 1977, he founded the [[Petra Bank]] in [[Jordan]] with Crown Prince Hassan, the King's brother.&lt;ref name = "profile"/&gt; In May 1989, the Governor of the [[Central Bank of Jordan]], [[Mohammed Said Nabulsi]], issued a decree ordering all banks in the country to deposit 35% of their reserves with the Central Bank.&lt;ref name="Roston2009"&gt;{{cite book|author =Aram Roston|title=The Man Who Pushed America to War: The Extraordinary Life, Adventures, and Obessions of Ahmad Chalabi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZRX1xXm04iEC&amp;pg=PT52|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Nation Books|isbn=978-0-7867-4429-9|pages=52–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Petra Bank was the only bank that was unable to meet this requirement.  An investigation was launched which led to accusations of embezzlement and false accounting.  The bank failed, causing a $350 million bail-out by the Central Bank.&lt;ref name = "chequered"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jeremy |last=Scott-Joynt |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2953109.stm |title=Chalabi's chequered finances |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |date=17 April 2003 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chalabi fled the country, in the boot of a Jordanian prince's car,&lt;ref name="TE Chalabi" /&gt; before the authorities could react. Chalabi was convicted and sentenced ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' for [[bank fraud]] by a Jordanian [[military tribunal]] to 22 years in prison.  Chalabi maintained that his prosecution was a politically motivated effort to discredit him sponsored by [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref name = "profile"/&gt;

=== Exile in the UK ===
Living abroad by 1992 in London, and unable to return home for fear of his life, he set up the Iraqi National Congress with an agenda of regime change for his homeland.  The organization was open to all ethnic Iraqis - Kurds and Arabs - as well as Sunnis and Shias.  Already a fluent English speaker, he turned his attention to Washington DC.

In 1995 after preparation and lobbying he persuaded President Clinton to fund an expedition into northern Iraq to use subterfuge to start an insurgency.  Chalabi was convinced that the Iraqi military would rise up to overthrow the dictator.  The commanders to whom he had spoken, were the same who openly supported Saddam and crushed his opponents in the Kurdish and Shi'ite revolts.  The insurgency failed, lacking the promised ground troops, and 100 insurgents were killed by the military.  The command structure of INC fell apart with factional infighting.  Chalabi was banned from those frequent visits to CIA HQ at Langley, Virginia.  Nonetheless Chalabi was doggedly determined: in 1998 Congress passed the Iraqi Liberation Act making it American law that "regime change" would happen in Iraq.

It was reported by BBC News in May 2005 that the Jordanian government was considering whether to [[pardon]] Chalabi, in part to ease the relations between Jordan and the new Iraqi government of which Chalabi was a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4551345.stm |title=Jordan considers clearing Chalabi |first=Jon |last=Leyne |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=16 May 2005 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report, Chalabi proposed a $32 million compensation fund for depositers affected by Petra Bank's failure. The website for Petra Bank contains a press release stating that Chalabi would refuse the pardon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petrabank.com/pre/table.php?news |title=Response to press reports about the resolution of Petra bank case |accessdate=2007-08-26 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070105133312/http://www.petrabank.com/pre/table.php?news |archivedate=5 January 2007 |df=dmy }}.

Chalabi headed the executive council of the INC, an umbrella Iraqi opposition group created in 1992 for the purpose of fomenting the overthrow of [[Saddam Hussein]].&lt;ref name = "legacy"/&gt; The INC received major funding and assistance from the United States.&lt;ref name = "chequered"/&gt; Chalabi was involved in organizing a resistance movement among [[Kurd]]s in northern Iraq in the early mid-1990s.&lt;ref name = "profile"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "chequered"/&gt; When that effort was crushed and hundreds of his supporters were killed, Chalabi fled the country.&lt;ref name = "profile"/&gt; Chalabi lobbied in Washington for the passage of the [[Iraq Liberation Act]] (passed October 1998).  This [[earmark (politics)|earmark]]ed [[United States dollar|US$]]97 million to support Iraqi opposition groups.&lt;ref name = "profile"/&gt; But in 2001 it was revealed that INC was accused of false accounting and irregularities.  During the period from March 2000 to September 2003, the U.S. State Department paid nearly $33 million to the INC, according to a [[General Accounting Office]] report released in 2004,some of which was used to purchase office artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040724075535/http://www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?gao-04-559 "State Department: Issues Affecting Funding of Iraqi National Congress Support Foundation"].

Before the [[Iraq War]] (2003), Chalabi enjoyed close political and business relationships with some members of the U.S. government, including some prominent [[neoconservatives]] within [[the Pentagon]]. Chalabi was said to have had political contacts within the [[Project for the New American Century]], most notably with [[Paul Wolfowitz]], a student of nuclear strategist [[Albert Wohlstetter]], and [[Richard Perle]]. He also enjoyed considerable support among politicians and political [[Pundit (politics)|pundit]]s in the United States, most notably [[Jim Hoagland]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', who held him up as a notable force for [[democracy]] in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/01/22/iraq.chalabi/index.html "Iraqi minister: Chalabi will be arrested: One-time U.S. confidant to face bank fraud charges in Jordan."] [[CNN]]. 22 January 2005.

The [[CIA]] was largely skeptical of Chalabi and the INC, but information allegedly from his group (most famously from a defector codenamed "Curveball") made its way into intelligence dossiers used by President [[George W. Bush]] and British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] to justify an invasion of Iraq. "Curveball", [[Curveball (informant)|Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi]], fed officials hundreds of pages of bogus "firsthand" descriptions of [[mobile weapons laboratory|mobile biological weapons factories]] on wheels and rails.&lt;ref name = "curve"/&gt; [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] later used this information in a [[U.N.]] presentation trying to garner support for the war, despite warnings from [[Federal Intelligence Service (Germany)|German intelligence]] that "Curveball" was fabricating claims.&lt;ref name = "curve"/&gt; Since then, the CIA has admitted that the defector made up the story, and Powell said in 2011 the information should not have been used in his presentation.&lt;ref name = "curve"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/16/colin-powell-cia-curveball |title=Colin Powell demands answers over Curveball's WMD lies |first1=Ed |last1=Pilkington |first2=Helen |last2=Pidd |first3=Martin |last3=Chulov |work=The Guardian |publisher= |date=16 February 2011 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later congressionally appointed investigation (Robb-Silberman) concluded that Curveball had no relation whatsoever to the INC, and that press reports linking Curveball to the INC were erroneous.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"&gt;{{cite web|date=1 April 2005 |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0401-10.htm |title=Intelligence Analysts Whiffed on a 'Curveball' |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=24 July 2007 |author1=Miller, Greg |author2=Drogin, Bob |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803124926/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines05/0401-10.htm |archivedate=3 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The INC often worked with the media, most notably with [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]], concerning her [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] stories for ''[[The New York Times]]'' starting on 26 February 1998.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Broad and Judith Miller.

''[[The New York Times]]''. 26 February 1998.  Accessed 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, given the lack of discovery of WMDs, most of the WMD claims of the INC were shown to have been either misleading, exaggerated, or completely made up while INC information about the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein's loyalists and Chalabi's personal enemies were accurate.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Another of Chalabi's advocates was [[American Enterprise Institute]]'s Iraq specialist [[Danielle Pletka]].  Chalabi received advice on media and television presentation techniques from the [[Ireland|Irish]] scriptwriter and commentator [[Eoghan Harris]] prior to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atholbooks.org/review/iraq.php "Iraq: Reduced To A State Of Nature In The Name Of Progress"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012122946/http://www.atholbooks.org/review/iraq.php |date=12 October 2007 }}. Editorial. ''Irish Political Review''. December 2006. Accessed 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=Additional citation needed.|date=November 2014}}

In April as U.S. forces took control during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Invasion of Iraq]], Chalabi entered with allied troops the southern town of Shatrah.  300 US-trained FIF (Freedom for Iraq Fighters) expected opposition, but none emerged.   Thousands of Iraqis cheered the troops.  Chalabi returned under their aegis and was given a position on the [[Iraq interim governing council]] by the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]].  He served as president of the council in September 2003. He denounced a plan to let the UN choose an interim government for Iraq. "We are grateful to [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] for liberating Iraq, but it is time for the [[Iraqi people]] to run their affairs," he was quoted as saying in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last= Sanger|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07EFD7113FF932A15756C0A9629C8B63|title=THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: THE EXILE; A Seat of Honor Lost to Open Political Warfare|date= 21 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2003, Chalabi was the only candidate whose unfavorable ratings exceeded his favorable ones with Iraqis in a State Department poll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Larry|last= Diamond|title=Squandered Victory: The American Occupation and the Bungled Effort to Bring Democracy to Iraq|place=New York|publisher=Times Books, Henry Holt &amp; Co.|date=2005|ref=p. 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey of nearly 3,000 Iraqis in February 2004 (by [[Oxford Research International]], sponsored by the [[BBC]] in the [[United Kingdom]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the U.S., [[ARD (TV)|ARD]] of [[Germany]], and the [[NHK]] in [[Japan]]), only 0.2 percent of respondents said he was the most trustworthy leader in Iraq (see survey link below, question #13).  A secret document written in 2002 by the British Overseas and Defence Secretariat reportedly described Chalabi as "a convicted fraudster popular on [[Capitol Hill]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1472540/Ministers-were-told-premier-was-seen-as-stooge.html |location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |title=Ministers were told premier was seen as stooge|first=Michael|last=Smith|date=24 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the WMD controversy, Chalabi told London's ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' in February 2004, &lt;blockquote&gt;We are heroes in error.  As far as we're concerned, we've been entirely successful.  That tyrant Saddam is gone and the Americans are in Baghdad.  What was said before is not important.  The [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] is looking for a scapegoat.&lt;ref name=Telegraph20040219 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Falling out with the U.S., 2004–05==
As Chalabi's position of trust with the Pentagon crumbled, he found a new political position as a champion of Iraq's [[Shi'ite]]s (Chalabi himself was a Shi'ite). Beginning 25 January 2004, Chalabi and his close associates promoted the claim that leaders around the world were illegally profiting from the [[Oil for Food program]]. These charges were around the same time that UN envoy [[Lakhdar Brahimi]] indicated that Chalabi would likely not be welcome in a future Iraqi government. Up until this time, Chalabi had been mentioned formally several times in connection with possible future leadership positions. Chalabi contended that documents in his possession detailed the misconduct, but he did not provide any documents or other evidence. The U.S. sharply criticized Chalabi's Oil for Food investigation as undermining the credibility of its own.

Additionally, Chalabi and other members of the INC were investigated for fraud involving the exchange of Iraqi currency, grand theft of both national and private assets, and many other criminal charges in Iraq. On 19 May 2004 the U.S. government discontinued their regular payments to Chalabi for information he provided. Iraqi police, supported by U.S. soldiers, raided his offices and residence on 20 May, taking documents and computers, presumably to be used as evidence.&lt;ref name = "analysis"/&gt; A major target of the raid was [[Aras Habib]], Chalabi's long-term director of intelligence, who controlled the vast network of agents bankrolled by U.S. funding. The U.S. announced that they had stopped funding the INC, having previously paid the organization $330,000 per month.&lt;ref name = "analysis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3735973.stm |title=Analysis: Rise and fall of Chalabi |first=Roger |last=Hardy |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=21 May 2004 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, it was reported that Chalabi gave U.S. state secrets to [[Iran]] in April, including the fact that one of the United States' most valuable sources of Iranian intelligence was a broken Iranian [[code (cryptography)|code]] used by their spy services.&lt;ref name = "code"/&gt; Chalabi allegedly learned of the code through a drunk American involved in the [[code-breaking]] operation.&lt;ref name = "code"&gt;James Risen and David Johnston.

''[[The New York Times]]''. 2 June 2004. Accessed 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Chalabi denied all of the charges, which nothing ever came of.

An arrest warrant for alleged [[counterfeiting]] was issued for Chalabi on 8 August 2004, while at the same time a warrant was issued on murder charges against his nephew [[Salem Chalabi]] (at the time, head of the [[Iraqi Special Tribunal]]), while they both were out of the country.&lt;ref name = "2005 profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2925785.stm |title=Profile: Ahmed Chalabi  |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=28 April 2005 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chalabi returned to Iraq on 10 August planning to make himself available to Iraqi government officials, but he was never arrested. Charges were later dropped against Chalabi, with Judge [[Zuhair al-Maliki]] citing lack of evidence.&lt;ref name = "2005 profile"/&gt;

On 1 September 2004, Chalabi told reporters of an assassination attempt made on him near [[Latifiya]], a town south of Baghdad. Chalabi reported he was returning from a meeting with Ayatollah [[Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani|Ali al-Sistani]] (whose trust Chalabi enjoyed)&lt;ref name="TE Chalabi" /&gt; in [[Najaf]], where a few days earlier a cease-fire had taken effect, ending three weeks of confrontations between followers of [[Muqtada al-Sadr]] and the U.S. military, at the time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

He regained enough credibility to be made deputy prime minister on 28 April 2005.&lt;ref name = "2005 profile"/&gt; At the same time he was made acting oil minister,&lt;ref name = "2005 profile"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newstandardnews.net/content/index.cfm/items/1759|title=Chalabi Named Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, Acting Oil Minister|work=newstandardnews.net|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the appointment of [[Ibrahim Bahr al-Uloum]] in May 2005.  On protesting IMF austerity measures, Al-Uloum was instructed to extend his vacation by a month in December 2005 by Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari, and Chalabi was reappointed as acting oil minister.  Al-Uloum returned to the post in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/business/2006/January/business_January147.xml&amp;section=business&amp;col=|title=Iraqi oil minister  Al Uloum back at work after quitting – Khaleej Times|author =(Reuters)|work=khaleejtimes.com|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, Chalabi traveled to the U.S. and met with top U.S. government officials, including Vice President [[Dick Cheney]], Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], and National Security Advisor [[Stephen Hadley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4422638.stm |title=Chalabi US trip stirs controversy |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=9 November 2005 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Chalabi also traveled to Iran to meet with Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]].

==Political activity in Iraq, 2005–15==
The [[Iraqi National Congress]], headed by Chalabi, was a part of the [[United Iraqi Alliance]] in the [[Iraqi parliamentary election, December 2005|2005 legislative election]].  After the election, Chalabi claimed that he had the support of the majority of elected members of [[United Iraqi Alliance]] and staked claim to be the first democratically elected Prime Minister of Iraq; however, [[Ibrahim al-Jaafari]] later emerged as the consensus candidate for prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4176/is_20050223/ai_n11055244 Iraq's Shiite ticket picks prime minister]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the December 2005 elections, the Iraqi National Congress had left the United Iraqi Alliance and formed the [[National Congress Coalition]], which ran in the elections but failed to win a single seat in Parliament, gaining less than 0.5% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/20/world/middleeast/20chalabi.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Middle%20East&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article |title=Early Backer of War, Finally Within Grasp of Power |first=Tim |last=Arango |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=19 March 2010 |accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other groups joining the INC in this list included: Democratic Iraqi Grouping, Democratic Joint Action Front, First Democratic National Party, Independent List, Iraqi Constitutional Movement, Iraqi Constitutional Party, Tariq Abd al-Karim Al Shahd al-Budairi, and the Turkoman Decision Party.  He was refused a seat in the cabinet.  Dogged by allegations, still unproven, of corruption he retorted that he had never "participated in any scheme of intelligence against the United States."&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph, p.33"&gt;The Daily Telegraph, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

Chalabi attended the 2006 [[Bilderberg Conference]] meeting outside of [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada.  In October 2007, Chalabi was appointed by Prime Minister [[Nouri al Maliki]] to head the Iraqi services committee, a consortium of eight service ministries and two Baghdad municipal posts tasked with the "surge" plan's next phase, restoring electricity, health, education and local security services to Baghdad neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Chalabi Back"&gt;Nancy A.

''[[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Newspapers]]''. 28 October 2007.  Accessed 20 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; "The key is going to be getting the concerned local citizens—and all the citizens—feeling that this government is reconnected with them.... [Chalabi] agrees with that," said Gen. [[David Petraeus]]. Chalabi "is an important part of the process," said Col. Steven Boylan, Petraeus' spokesman. "He has a lot of energy."&lt;ref name="Chalabi Back"/&gt; In April 2008, journalist [[Melik Kaylan]] wrote about Chalabi, "Arguably, he has, more than anyone in the country, evolved a detailed sense of what ails Baghdadis and how to fix things."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB120795932252409419 Perseverance Pays Off in Baghdad], [[Melik Kaylan]], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', 12 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After the invasion Chalabi was placed in charge of "[[de-Ba'athification]]"—the removal of senior office holders judged to have been close supporters of the deposed Saddam Hussein.  The role fell into disuse, but in early 2010 Chalabi was accused of reviving this dormant post to eliminate his political enemies, especially Sunnis.  The banning of some 500 candidates prior to the general election of 7 March 2010 at the initiative of Chalabi and his Iraqi National Congress was reported to have badly damaged previously improving relations between Shias and Sunnis.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]'', 30 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2012, ''The New York Times'' reported Western intelligence officials expressing concern that Chalabi was working with the leading opposition group in [[Bahrain]], [[Al Wefaq National Islamic Society]].  A French intelligence official said, "When we hear that some members of the opposition are in touch with [[Hezbollah]] or with shady figures like the Iraqi Ahmed Chalabi, of whom we think he is acting on behalf of [[Iran]], then this worries us".  The connection between Chalabi and Al Wefaq was acknowledged by [[Jawad Fairooz]], secretary general of Wefaq and a former member of Parliament in Bahrain.  Fairooz said, "Mr Chalabi has helped us with contacts in Washington like other people have done and we thank them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author =Souad Mekhennet|title=In Bahrain, Worries Grow of Violent Shiite-Sunni Confrontation|date=25 January 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/26/world/middleeast/26iht-m26-bahrain-conflict.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview in 2014, he was shown to be frail and depressed about his country's future:

'''Benelli Armi SpA''' is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[firearm]] manufacturer founded in 1967, located in [[Urbino]], Italy, best known for [[shotgun]]s used by military, law enforcement and civilians all over the world. Particularly famous is the [[Benelli M3]] 12 [[Gauge (bore diameter)|gauge]], used extensively by American [[SWAT]] teams. Benelli Armi was founded in 1967 as an offshoot of the [[Benelli (motorcycles)|Benelli motorcycle]] factory that sold motorcycles through [[Montgomery Ward]]. Benelli and Benelli USA have been owned by [[Beretta|Pietro Beretta SpA]] since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Fabbrica-D-Armi-Pietro-Beretta-SpA-Company-History.html |title=Fabbrica D' Armi Pietro Beretta S.p.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In 1911 Teresa Benelli invested in her 6 sons to begin an auto service company. Eventually their services expanded to include servicing motorcycles and even building their own. In 1967 they acted on their love of hunting as well as their belief in the semi-auto shotgun by developing firearms. They did this by teaming up with Bruno Civolani the developer of a revolutionary new action and patenting the "Inertia Driven" mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Benelli History: How One of the Biggest Firearms Brands Came to Be|url = http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/guns-benelli-gun-history/2015/05/04/id/642110/|website = Newsmax|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shotguns ==
[[Image:M-1014 Benelli.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Benelli [[M4 Super 90]] (M1014 combat shotgun)]]
Many Benelli shotguns utilize a unique [[Recoil operation#Inertia operation|inertia]] operating system developed by Bruno Civolani.&lt;ref name="benelli.it"/&gt; In 1999 Benelli introduced the [[Benelli M4 Super 90]], an unusual gas operated [[semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic]] shotgun intended for military and law enforcement use.

The Benelli Super Black Eagle, a favorite of waterfowlers, was one of the first semi-automatic shotguns capable of firing the 2.75, 3, and 3.5&amp;nbsp;inch shotgun shells. The Benelli Nova (pump action), M1 Super 90, and a customized M2 Field were used by [[Tom Knapp]] during his shooting exhibitions wherein he frequently shot down several hand-thrown clay targets while still in mid-air, setting a world record in October 2004 when he destroyed 10 such targets with 10 shots in 2.0 seconds, with all the targets still airborne.

CMAs applied expertise in accounting, management and strategy to ensure corporate accountability and help organizations maintain a long-term competitive advantage. In that regard, CMA Canada offered executive development programs, online courses, and knowledge management publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = Professional Development |url = http://www.cma-canada.org/index.cfm?ci_id=4602&amp;la_id=1 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141010195112/http://www.cma-canada.org/index.cfm?ci_id=4602&amp;la_id=1 |archive-date = October 10, 2014 |dead-url = yes |accessdate = June 6, 2017 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competencies, accreditation process and post-qualification development==

CMAs are expected to undergo specific training and practical experience to achieve specified competencies in the area of strategic management accounting, which are intended to prepare them for senior leadership roles in their organizations.&lt;ref name="CompMap"&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''The CMA Competency Map'' |url = http://www.cma-canada.org/index.cfm/ci_id/19412/la_id/1/document/1/re_id/0 |accessdate = 2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are six functional competencies and four enabling competencies in that regard:

'''Functional competencies'''

* [[Strategic management]]
* [[Risk management]] and [[corporate governance|governance]]
* [[Performance management]]
* [[Performance measurement]]
* [[Finance|Financial management]]
* [[Financial reporting]]

'''Enabling competencies'''

* [[Problem solving]] and [[decision making]]
* [[Leadership]] and [[group dynamics]]
* [[Professionalism]] and [[ethics|ethical behaviour]]
* [[Communication]]

While candidates may come from a variety of backgrounds, the CMA career path is expected to progress in the following manner:&lt;ref name="CompMap"/&gt;

{| border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
|- 
| '''Stage''' || '''Phase''' || '''Nature'''
|-
| '''Acquisition'''
| Prior to passage of CMA Entrance Examination
| In process of completing undergraduate studies, or 5–7 years thereafter. Already in junior to [[middle management]] level in their organization.
|-
| '''Basic Proficiency'''
| Acquisition of the CMA designation and the following five years thereafter
| Already in [[middle management]] level, and progressively gaining more practical experience and responsibility.
|-
| '''Advanced Proficiency'''
| 5–10 years post-qualification
| Early- to mid-career professionals, with most having achieved more senior positions within the [[middle management]] layer. A significant number hold introductory [[senior management]] positions in their area of specialization or in the organization as a whole.
|-
| '''Mastery'''
| 10–25 years post-qualification
| Late-career professionals, operating in [[senior management]] roles. Most are either the highest-ranking financial officers in their organization or financial professionals with specialized knowledge in particular functional areas. A significant proportion of individuals are operating in the desired "C" space - i.e., [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Chief financial officer|CFO]], [[Chief risk officer|CRO]] or [[Chief information officer|CIO]] - and some of these are leaders of large enterprises or significant [[strategic business unit]]s.
|}

CMA candidates (without advanced professional standing) must have obtained a university degree and have credits in a specified list of subjects, before they can write the CMA Entrance Examination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''CMA Entrance Examination'' |url = http://www.cma-canada.org/index.cfm/ci_id/4122/la_id/1/document/1/re_id/0 |accessdate = 2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon passing this stage, they then enter the Strategic Leadership Programme ("SLP"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''CMA Canada Strategic Leadership Program'' |url = http://www.cma-canada.org/index.cfm/ci_id/4123/la_id/1/document/1/re_id/0 |accessdate = 2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has the following components:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''The CMA Canada Accreditation Process'' |url = http://www.cma-canada.org/index.cfm/ci_id/4121/la_id/1/document/1/re_id/0 |accessdate = 2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Development Phase''
** followed by the successful passing of the '''CMA Case Examination'''
* ''Application Phase''
** leading to the successful preparation and presentation of the '''Board Report''', containing detailed analysis and recommendations on a specified case study
* Completion of 24 months of '''relevant full-time progressive practical experience confirmed by the employer''' - of which at least 12 months must be concurrent with the SLP
** Candidates are expected to be '''expanding their on-the-job responsibilities while undertaking the SLP'''

Successful passage of the above will result in the granting of the CMA designation. After attaining the designation, there are specified requirements for continuous professional learning and development that must be undertaken to remain in good standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ''The National Standard for Continuous Professional Learning and Development for certified Management Accountants'' |url = http://www.cma-canada.org/index.cfm/ci_id/5104/la_id/1/document/1/re_id/0 |accessdate = 2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born into a family of Greek immigrants to the United States in [[Newark, New Jersey]], Argyris (pronounced AHR-JUR-ris) grew up in [[Irvington, New Jersey]] and Athens, Greece.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.credoreference.com/content/topic/argyris_chris_1923&lt;/ref&gt; In World War II he served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infed.org/mobi/chris-argyris-theories-of-action-double-loop-learning-and-organizational-learning/ Chris Argyris: theories of action, double-loop learning and organizational learning] at infed.org.&lt;/ref&gt; After his service he studied psychology at [[Clark University]], where he met [[Kurt Lewin]]. He obtained his MA in 1947, and joined the [[Kansas University]], where he obtained his MSc in Psychology and Economics in 1949. In 1951 received his PhD from Cornell University, with a thesis on the behavior in organizations under the supervision of [[William F. Whyte]].

In 1951 Argyris started his academic career at [[Yale University]] as part of the [[Yale Labor and Management Center]] where he worked under its director and an early influence, [[E. Wight Bakke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Organizational Behavior: Foundations, Theories, and Analyses | first=John B. | last=Miner | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=New York | year=2002 | page=567}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Yale he subsequently became appointed Professor of Management science. In 1971 he moved to [[Harvard University]], where he was Professor of Education and Organizational Behavior, until his retirement. Argyris was active as director of the consulting firm Monitor in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Chris Argyris received an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the [[University of Toronto]] in 2006. He also received a Doctor of Science award from [[Yale University]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yale News: Citations for Recipients of Honorary Degrees at Yale University 2011|url=http://news.yale.edu/2011/05/23/citations-recipients-honorary-degrees-yale-university-2011|accessdate=2 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421185809/http://news.yale.edu/2011/05/23/citations-recipients-honorary-degrees-yale-university-2011|archivedate=21 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
Chris Argyris' early research explored the impact of formal organizational structures, control systems and management on individuals and how they responded and adapted to them. This research resulted in the books ''Personality and Organization'' (1957) and ''Integrating the Individual and the Organization'' (1964). He then shifted his focus to organizational change, in particular exploring the behaviour of senior executives in organizations (''Interpersonal Competence and Organizational Effectiveness'' (1962); ''Organization and Innovation'' (1965).

From there he moved on to an inquiry into the role of the social scientist as both researcher and actor (''Intervention Theory and Method'' (1970); ''Inner Contradictions of Rigorous Research'' (1980) and ''Action Science'' (1985) – with Robert Putnam and Diana McLain Smith). His fourth major area of research and theorizing – in significant part undertaken with [[Donald Schön]] – was in individual and organizational learning and the extent to which human reasoning, not just behavior, can become the basis for diagnosis and action (''Theory in Practice'' (1974); ''Organizational Learning'' (1978); ''Organizational Learning II'' (1996) – all with Donald Schön). He has also developed this thinking in ''Overcoming Organizational Defenses'' (1990) and ''Knowledge for Action'' (1993).

=== Adult personality ===
Argyris believed that managers who treat people positively and as responsible adults will achieve productivity. Mature workers want additional responsibilities, variety of tasks, and the ability to participate in decisions. He also came to the conclusion that problems with employees are the result of mature personalities managed using outdated practices.

===Action science===
Argyris' collaborative work with Robert W. Putnam,&lt;ref&gt;[http://actionscience.net/about/people/putnam Action Design: Robert Putnam bio]&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with [[Robert D. Putnam]]), and Diana McLain Smith&lt;ref&gt;[http://actionscience.net/about/people/smith Action Design: Diana Mclain Smith bio]&lt;/ref&gt; advocates an approach to research that focuses on generating knowledge that is useful in solving practical problems. Other key concepts developed by Argyris include ladder of inference, [[double-loop learning]] {{Harv|Argyris|Schön|1974}}, theory of action/espoused theory/theory-in-use, high advocacy/high inquiry dialogue and actionable knowledge and  the study of adult personality.

Argyris' concept of Action Science begins with the study of how [[human]] beings design their actions in difficult situations.  Human actions are designed to achieve intended consequences and governed by a set of environment variables.  How those governing variables are treated in designing actions are the key differences between single-loop learning and [[double-loop learning]].  When actions are designed to achieve the intended consequences and to suppress conflict about the governing variables, a single-loop learning cycle usually ensues.  On the other hand, when actions are taken, not only to achieve the intended consequences, but also to openly inquire about conflict and to possibly transform the governing variables, both single-loop and double-loop learning cycles usually ensue.  (Argyris applies single-loop and double-loop learning concepts not only to personal behaviors but also to organizational behaviors in his models.)

Model 1 illustrates how single-loop learning affects human actions.  Model 2 describes how double-loop learning affects human actions.  The following Model 1 and Model 2 tables introduce these ideas (tables are from Argyris, Putnam &amp; Smith, 1985, Action Science, Ch. 3).  Other key books conveying Argyris' approach include Argyris &amp; Schon, 1974 and Argyris, 1970, 1980, 1994).

'''Clayton Magleby Christensen''' (born April 6, 1952) is an American academic, business consultant, and religious leader who currently serves as the [[Kim B. Clark]] Professor of [[Business Administration]] at the [[Harvard Business School]] of [[Harvard University]]. He is best known for his theory of "[[disruptive innovation]]"{{mdash}}first introduced in his first book, ''[[The Innovator's Dilemma]]''{{mdash}}which has been called the most influential business idea of the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Bagehot|date=15 June 2017|work=The Economist|page=53|url=https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21723426-labours-leader-has-disrupted-business-politics-jeremy-corbyn-entrepreneur|title=Jeremy Corbyn, Entrepreneur|access-date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen is also a co-founder of Rose Park Advisors, a venture capital firm, and [[Innosight]], a management consulting and investment firm specializing in innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Clay Christensen's Life Lessons|first=Bradford|last=Wieners|date=3 May 2012|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-03/clay-christensens-life-lessons#p4|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Clayton M. Christensen was born on April 6, 1952, in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], the second of eight children born to Robert M. Christensen (1926–1976) and his wife Verda Mae Christensen (''née'' Fuller; 1922–2004).&lt;ref name="dg"&gt;{{cite news |last=de Groote |first=Michael |date=27 Nov 2010 |title=Clayton Christensen: Just a Guy from Rose Park |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700086287/Clayton-Christensen-Just-a-guy-from-Rose-Park.html?pg=all |newspaper=Deseret News |location= |access-date=9 Dec 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the [[Rose Park, Salt Lake City|Rose Park]] neighborhood of Salt Lake City and attended the nearby [[West High School (Utah)|West High School]], where he was student body president.&lt;ref name="dg" /&gt;  Christensen and his siblings were raised as members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).

After graduating from high school in 1970, Christensen matriculated at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU). While at BYU, he took a two-year leave of absence from 1971 to 1973 to serve as a volunteer [[Missionary (LDS Church)|full-time missionary]] for the LDS Church.  He was assigned to serve in [[South Korea]] and became a fluent speaker of [[Korean language|Korean]]. After completing his missionary service, Christensen returned to BYU, graduating in 1975 with an [[University Honors|Honors]] [[B.A.]] ''[[Magna cum laude|summa cum laude]]'' in [[economics]]. Upon graduating, he received a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] and spent two years studying applied [[econometrics]] at [[Oxford University]], receiving an [[Master of Philosophy|M.Phil.]] in 1977.   Christensen then returned to the United States and moved to [[Harvard University]] to pursue an [[MBA]] at the [[Harvard Business School]], which he earned with high distinction in 1979.

== Career ==
After receiving his MBA in 1979, Christensen began working for the [[Boston Consulting Group]] (BCG) as a consultant and project manager.&lt;ref name="dg" /&gt; He took a leave of absence  from 1982 to 1983 to work in [[Washington, D.C.]] as an assistant to the [[United States Secretary of Transportation|U.S. Secretary of Transportation]], serving under [[Drew Lewis]] and then [[Elizabeth Dole]].  In 1984, he and several professors from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] founded an advanced [[ceramics]] company called Ceramics Process Systems Corporation (now known as CPS Technologies).  Christensen served as its president and CEO through the late 1980s, then decided to leave the company and become a university professor.  He returned to Harvard for doctoral study in business, receiving a [[Doctor of Business Administration]] degree in 1992.  After completing his doctorate, Christensen joined the Harvard Business School faculty and set a record by achieving the rank of [[Professor|"full" professor]] in only six years.&lt;ref name="dg" /&gt;

In 2000, he founded Innosight LLC, a consulting and training firm. In 2005, together with his colleagues at Innosight, he launched Innosight Ventures, a venture firm focused on investing in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. In 2007, he co-founded Rose Park Advisors LLC (named after the neighborhood in Salt Lake City where he was raised), an investment company which applies his research as an investment strategy.

He serves on the board of directors of [[Tata Group|Tata]] Consultancy Services (NSE: TCS), Franklin Covey (NYSE: FC), and the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty.

At HBS, he teaches an elective course he designed called "Building and Sustaining a Successful Enterprise", which teaches  how to build and manage an enduring, successful company or transform an existing organization, and also  in many of the school's  executive education programs. Christensen was awarded a full professorship with tenure in 1998, and currently holds eight [[honorary doctorates]] and an honorary chaired professorship at the [[National Tsinghua University]] in [[Taiwan]].
&lt;ref name="drfd.hbs.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facInfo=bio&amp;facEmId=cchristensen |title=Clayton M. Christensen - Faculty - Harvard Business School |publisher=Drfd.hbs.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen is the best-selling author of ten books, including his seminal work ''[[The Innovator's Dilemma]]'' (1997), which received the Global Business Book Award for the best business book of the year. One of the main concepts depicted in this book is also his most disseminated and famous one: disruptive innovation. The concept has been growing in interest over time since 2004, according to Google Trends' data. However, due to constant misinterpretation, Christensen still often writes articles trying to explain the concept even further. Some of his other books are focused on specific industries and discuss social issues such as education and health care.  ''Disrupting Class'' (2008) looks at the root causes of why schools struggle and offers solutions, while ''The Innovator's Prescription'' (2009) examines how to fix the American healthcare system.  The latter two books have received numerous awards as the best books on education and health care in their respective years of publication.  ''The Innovator's Prescription'' was also awarded the 2010 James A. Hamilton Award, by the College of Healthcare Executives.&lt;ref name="drfd.hbs.edu"/&gt;

== Personal life ==
Christensen lives in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]], [[Massachusetts]] with his wife, Christine.  They have five children, including Matthew Christensen, who played college basketball at [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke University]] and was a member of the [[2000–01 Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team|2001 National Championship team]].&lt;ref name=mattc_duke&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toone|first1=Trent|title=Mormons in the ACC: Tar Heel guard plans to serve mission, while former Duke center reflects on career|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700218888/Mormons-in-the-ACC-Tar-Heel-guard-plans-to-serve-mission-while-former-Duke-center-reflects-on.html?pg=all|accessdate=19 January 2015|work=[[Deseret News]]|date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christensen himself is an avid [[basketball]] player who stands {{height|ft=6|in=8}} tall, and was the starting [[Center (basketball)|center]] on the men's basketball team during his time at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.byui.edu/Presentations/transcripts/devotionals/2004_06_08_christensen.htm|title=Decisions for Which I've Been Grateful|year=2004|publisher=BYU-Idaho|accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He served as an [[area seventy]] from 2002 to 2009. He has also served as a counselor in the [[mission president|presidency]] of the Massachusetts Boston [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]] and as a [[Bishop (LDS Church)|bishop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= New Area Authority Seventies |newspaper= [[Church News]] |url= http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/41712/New-Area-Authority-Seventies.html |date= April 20, 2002 |accessdate= 2013-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, Christensen announced that he had been diagnosed with [[follicular lymphoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Comments on my health |url=http://drfd.hbs.edu/fit/public/facultyInfo.do?facEmId=cchristensen%40hbs.edu&amp;facInfo=custom&amp;linkId=1251}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, he had an [[Brain ischemia|ischemic stroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/global/2011/0314/features-clayton-christensen-health-care-cancer-survivor.html|title=Clayton Christensen: The Survivor - Forbes.com|last=Whelan|first=David|date=14 March 2011|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claytonchristensen.com/myhealth.html|title=Clayton Christensen - My Health|accessdate=10 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207205607/http://claytonchristensen.com/myhealth.html|archivedate=7 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Christensen’s health setbacks, he is once again actively teaching, speaking and writing. In 2011, Christensen published two books: ''The Innovative University''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Innovative University – Changing the DNA of Higher Education © 2011|publisher=(Jossey-Bass)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Innovator’s DNA'' (Harvard Business Press).

[[Image:Con constantine.JPG|thumb|220px|right|Con Constantine]]

'''Con Constantine''' (born 1 July 1945) is a [[Cypriot Australian]] businessman and the former owner of the [[Australia]]n [[football (soccer)]] club [[Newcastle United Jets]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Con Constantine migrated to Australia with his parents and siblings from the town of Maroni, near [[Larnaka]], [[Cyprus]] at the age of 10. At a young age, he started working in a takeaway food store before going on to sell [[houseplant]]s.

In 1985, he built [[Parklea, New South Wales|Parklea]] [[flea market|Markets]] (on the site of a former [[drive-in cinema]]), initially operating it as a [[plant nursery]] while seeking council approval. After approval was granted, Parklea Markets quickly established itself as one of the premier retail destinations in [[Greater Western Sydney|Western Sydney]].

In recent years, Constantine has expanded his interests to [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], 150&amp;nbsp;km north of Sydney, where he is the owner of ''The Store''. He recently purchased two Newcastle community papers, the ''Newcastle &amp; Lake Macquarie Post'' and the ''Hunter Post'', from [[Fairfax Media]]. Constantine is a supporter of his local [[Blacktown, New South Wales|Blacktown]] [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] parish as well as many legitimate Sydney and Newcastle charities.

===Newcastle United Jets===
Constantine was the owner and chairman of [[Newcastle United Jets]], an [[Australian]] professional [[Association football|football (soccer)]] club based in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]. The club competes in the [[A-League]] and plays its home games at [[Newcastle International Sports Centre|Hunter Stadium]]. They were the [[A-League]] Champions for the 2007–08 A-League season, after defeating the [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]] 1-0 in the  [[A-League 2007-08#Finals series|Grand Final]]. The club was formed in 2000 when it joined the [[National Soccer League (Australia)|National Soccer League]] as Newcastle United.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newcastlejets.com.au/default.aspx?s=njfc_history |title=Newcastle Jets History |publisher=Newcastle United Jets FC |accessdate=2007-09-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110607/http://www.newcastlejets.com.au/default.aspx?s=njfc_history |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantine replaced Jets' manager [[Richard Money]] with an Australian, [[Nick Theodorakopoulos]], for the 2006/2007 [[A-League]] season. Theodorakopoulos was sacked as manager after a lacklustre start to the season. The new coach was [[Gary van Egmond]] with support from assistant coach Mark Jones. For the 2009–10 season, former Sydney FC coach [[Branko Culina]] was appointed head coach after Gary van Egmond's shock departure.

Constantine chose to bring in controversial striker [[Mario Jardel]] to Newcastle. The Brazilian legend had a successful career, but was out of shape and out of form by the time he arrived at the Jets. Constantine has invested over $15 million into the Newcastle Jets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/sport/football-soccer/ffa-must-lead-way-in-newcastles-time-of-need/1930242.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/sport/football-soccer/con-needs-more-than-words-or-club-left-with-sweet-ffa/1933116.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

After an unsuccessful 2008/2009 season, a group of Newcastle supporters staged a small protest by hanging all their banners upside down. Constantine invited the leaders of the group to his corporate box and allegedly threatened them. The incident was investigated by the [[Football Federation Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/94343,ffa-probe-jets-boss-flareup.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123140820/http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/94343%2Cffa-probe-jets-boss-flareup.aspx |archivedate=2009-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/why-con-constantine-swore-at-fans/1411233.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September 2010, Con was stripped of his licence of the Newcastle Jets. The team was taken over on a short-term basis by local businessman [[Nathan Tinkler]].&lt;ref&gt;http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/news/1023871/Newcastle-Jets-future-secured&lt;/ref&gt; Constantine made a tearful farewell press conference and accused the FFA of backstabbing him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/news/general/newcastle-or-nothing-cons-tearful-display-in-bitter-farewell/1949445.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theherald.com.au/news/local/sport/football-soccer/lack-of-inclusion-finally-cost-con-control-of-his-beloved-football-club/1949421.aspx?storypage=0&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8367">'''Configure Price Quote (CPQ)''' software is a term used in the business-to-business ([[Business-to-business|B2B]]) industry to describe software systems that help sellers quote complex and configurable products.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.techopedia.com/definition/29476/configure-price-quote-software-cpq Techopedia (CPQ)]"Configure Price Quote Software (CPQ)"&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"Configure, Price, Quote, or CPQ, is software that helps companies accurately define the price of goods across a huge and constantly changing spectrum of variables. CPQ software aggregates these variables, which in turn allows companies to configure products or services in the most optimal way (i.e. bundling, upsells, etc.), price them according to costs, competition and local economic factors, and quote a customer the absolute best price possible in accordance with all of the above factors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.financialforce.com/resources/what-is-configure-price-quote-cpq/|title=What is Configure Price Quote (CPQ)? - FinancialForce|work=FinancialForce|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.calliduscloud.com/configure-price-quote-cpq/cp/what-is-cpq/|title=What Is CPQ? - CallidusCloud|work=CallidusCloud|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;An example could be a maker of heavy trucks. If the customer chooses a certain [[chassis]] (the base frame of a motor vehicle), the choice of engines may be limited, because certain engines might not fit a certain chassis. Given a certain choice of engine, the choice of trailer may be limited (e.g. a heavy trailer requires a stronger engine), and so on. If the product is highly configurable, the user may face [[combinatorial explosion]], which means the rapid growth of the complexity of a problem. Thus a configuration engine is employed to alleviate this problem.

==Configuration engines==
The "Configure" in CPQ deals with the complex challenges of combining components and parts into a sellable product.

There are three main approaches used to alleviate the problem of combinatorial explosion:
# '''Rule-based truth-maintenance systems''': These systems were the first generation of configuration engines, launched in the 1970s based on research results in [[artificial intelligence]] going back to the 1960s. Notable implementations are [[XCON]] and [[SAP SE|SAP]]'s Variant Configuration Module in [[SAP ERP]]&lt;ref name="Marin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blumöhr|first1=Uwe|last2=Münch|first2=Manfred|last3=Ukalovic|first3=Marin|title=Variant Configuration with SAP|date=2011|isbn=978-1592294008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oracle's Cloud CPQ integration with Salesforce.
# '''[[Constraint programming|Constraint solving engines]]:''' These engines were developed in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="Felfernig 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Felfernig|first1=Alexander|last2=Holz|first2=Lothar|last3=Bagley|first3=Claire|last4=Tiihonen|first4=Juha|title=A Short History of Configuration Technologies|journal=Knowledge-Based Configuration – From research to Business Cases|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can handle the full set of configuration rules to alleviate the problem of combinatorial explosion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.it.uu.se/edu/course/homepage/constech/ht09/schedule/ct_config.pdf Uppsala University course 'Constraint Technology for Solving Combinatorial Problems']"Constraint Technology for Solving Configuration Problems"&lt;/ref&gt; but can be complex and difficult to maintain as rules have to be written to accommodate the intended use.&lt;ref name="configit.com"&gt;http://configit.com/configit_wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Virtual-Tabulation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Compile-based configurators:''' These configurators build upon constraint-based engines and research in [[Binary Decision Diagrams]]. This approach compiles all possible combinations in a single distributable file and is agnostic to how rules are expressed by the author. This enables businesses to import rules from legacy systems and handle increasingly more complex sets of rules and constraints tied to increasingly more customizable products.&lt;ref name="configit.com" /&gt; The concept of [[Configuration lifecycle management|Configuration Lifecycle Management (CLM)]], of which CPQ is a component, describes how compile-based configuration can further be leveraged to address most of the problems related to product configuration for business employing [[Mass Customization]].

==Benefits of CPQ==
CPQ software simplifies &amp; speeds up the configuration, pricing and quotation of complex &amp; customized products. The software helps sales teams come up with optimal product configurations based on customer requirements.

The process of performing engineering calculations, evaluating suitable product alternatives &amp; finally generating the necessary commercial documentation is fully automated in CPQ software. This process reduces errors &amp; boosts sales productivity. The risk of missing opportunities due to insufficient time to respond is reduced. Quotes become more accurate. Knowledge about product configuration is captured in the form of rules assisting the retention of crucial product &amp; process knowledge, mitigating the risk of knowledge drain.

Benefits to CPQ software also include:
* Increased sales &amp; engineering productivity 
* Guided selling
* Sales efficiency
* Accurate quotations
* Improved client solution life cycle management
* Higher customer satisfaction
* Reduced operational costs
* Standardized processes
* Streamlined production &amp; procurement
* Knowledge management
* Cost &amp; price management
* Analytics

== Industry ==
The CPQ industry has many vendors offering CPQ solutions including [https://configit.com/products/configit-quote/ Configit Quote], [https://hivecpq.com/en/ HIVE CPQ], [https://www.servicepath.co/ servicePath CPQ], [https://www.experlogix.com/ Experlogix CPQ], [https://www.verenia.com/ Verenia], [https://www.verenia.com/verenia-cpq-for-netsuite Verenia Native CPQ for NetSuite], https://www.tacton.com/ Tacton Systems, Accenture bit2win Sales, [https://www.cincom.com/cpq Cincom Systems], [https://configureone.com/ Configure One], Axonom Powertrak, [[CallidusCloud]] Configure Price Quote&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.calliduscloud.com/configure-price-quote-cpq/|title=Configure, Price and Quote (CPQ) Software|website=calliduscloud.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[IBM]] Configure Price Quote, [http://www.kbmax.com KBMax], [[Salesforce.com|Salesforce]] CPQ, Showefy CPQ, Sofon, Vendavo CPQ, [https://www.quotewerks.com/ QuoteWerks], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/3488142/market-guide-configure-price-quote|title=Market Guide for Configure, Price and Quote Application Suites|website=www.gartner.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some vendors focus more on one of the components in a CPQ solution, so that for example a price optimization provider may integrate their pricing software with another provider's configuration engine - and vice versa.

The IT research and advisory firm [[Gartner]] estimated that the CPQ market was $570 million in 2015, representing a 20 percent year-on-year growth from 2014. Of that $570 million, cloud-based CPQ revenue was $157 million that same year. "Gartner predicts CPQ will continue to be one of the hottest enterprise apps for the foreseeable future, predicting a 20% annual growth rate through 2020 with the majority being from cloud-based solutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://enosix.com/key-takeaways-from-gartners-market-guide-for-configure-price-and-quote-cpq-application-suites-2016/|title=Key Takeaways From Gartner's Market Guide For Configure, Price and Quote (CPQ) Application Suites, 2016|website=enosix.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Control''', or '''controlling''', is one of the managerial functions like ''planning'', ''organizing'', ''staffing'' and ''directing''. It is an important function because it helps to check the errors and to take the corrective action so that deviation from standards are minimized and stated goals of the organization are achieved in a desired manner.

According to modern concepts, control is a foreseeing action whereas earlier concept of control was used only when errors were detected. Control in management means setting standards, measuring actual performance and taking corrective action.

== Definition ==
In 1916, [[Henri Fayol]] formulated one of the first definitions of control as it pertains to management: &lt;blockquote&gt;
''Control of an undertaking consists of seeing that everything is being carried out in accordance with the plan which has been adopted, the orders which have been given, and the principles which have been laid down. Its object is to point out mistakes in order that they may be rectified and prevented from recurring.''&lt;ref name="Fayol"&gt;{{cite book |author= Henri Fayol|title= General and Industrial Management|publisher= Pitman Publishing|location=New York|year=1949|pages=107–109|isbn=|oclc=825227|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Edward Francis Leopold Brech|EFL Brech]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Control is checking current performance against pre-determined standards contained in the plans, with a view to ensure adequate progress and satisfactory performance.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Harold Koontz]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Controlling is the measurement and correction of performance in order to make sure that enterprise objectives and the plans devised to attain them are accomplished.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Stafford Beer]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;
''Management is the profession of control.''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Robert J. Mockler]] presented a more comprehensive definition of managerial control:&lt;blockquote&gt; 
''Management control can be defined as a systematic effort by business management to compare performance to predetermined standards, plans, or objectives in order to determine whether performance is in line with these standards and presumably in order to take any remedial action required to see that human and other corporate resources are being used in the most effective and efficient way possible in achieving corporate objectives.''&lt;ref name="Mockler"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert J. Mockler|title=Readings in Management Control|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York|year=1970|pages=14–17|isbn=978-0-390-64439-8 |oclc=115076|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also control can be defined as ''"that function of the system that adjusts operations as needed to achieve the plan, or to maintain variations from system objectives within allowable limits"''. The control subsystem functions in close harmony with the operating system. The degree to which they interact depends on the nature of the operating system and its objectives. Stability concerns a system's ability to maintain a pattern of output without wide fluctuations. Rapidity of response pertains to the speed with which a system can correct variations and return to expected output.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Arvid Johnson|title=Management, systems, and society : an introduction|publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co.|location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.|year=1976 |pages=148–142|isbn=978-0-87620-540-2 |oclc=2299496|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A political election can illustrate the concept of control and the importance of feedback. Each party organizes a campaign to get its candidate selected and outlines a plan to inform the public about both the candidate's credentials and the party's platform. As the election nears, opinion polls furnish feedback about the effectiveness of the campaign and about each candidate's chances to win. Depending on the nature of this feedback, certain adjustments in strategy and/or tactics can be made in an attempt to achieve the desired result.

From these definitions it can be stated that there is close link between planning and controlling. Planning is a process by which an organization's objectives and the methods to achieve the objectives are established, and controlling is a process which measures and directs the actual performance against the planned goals of the organization. Thus, goals and objectives are often referred to as [[siamese twins]] of [[management]].
the managerial function of management and correction of performance in order to make sure that enterprise objectives and the goals devised to attain them being accomplished.

==Elements==
The four basic elements in a control system:
# the characteristic or condition to be controlled
# the sensor
# the comparator
# the activator

occur in the same sequence and maintain a consistent relationships to each other in every system.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;
 
The first element is the ''characteristic'' or condition of the operating system which is to be measured. We select a specific characteristic because a correlation exists between it and how the system is performing. The characteristic can be the output of the system during any stage of processing or it may be a condition that is the result of the system. For example, it may be the heat energy produced by the furnace or the temperature in the room which has changed because of the heat generated by the furnace. In an elementary school system, the hours a teacher works or the gain in knowledge demonstrated by the students on a national examination are examples of characteristics that may be selected for measurement, or control.

The second element of control, the ''sensor'', is a means for measuring the characteristic or condition. For example, in a home heating system this device would be the thermostat, and in a quality-control system this measurement might be performed by a visual inspection of the product.

The third element of control, the [[comparator]], determines the need for correction by comparing what is occurring with what has been planned. Some deviation from the plan is usual and expected, but when variations are beyond those considered acceptable, corrective action is required. It involves a sort of preventative action which indicates that good control is being achieved.

The fourth element of control, the activator, is the corrective action taken to return the system to its expected output. The actual person, device, or method used to direct corrective inputs into the operating system may take a variety of forms. It may be a hydraulic controller positioned by a solenoid or electric motor in response to an electronic error signal, an employee directed to rework the parts that failed to pass quality inspection, or a school principal who decides to buy additional books to provide for an increased number of students. As long as a plan is performed within allowable limits, corrective action is not necessary; however, this seldom occurs in practice.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

[[Information]] is the medium of control, because the flow of sensory data and later the flow of corrective information allow a characteristic or condition of the system to be controlled. To illustrate how information flow facilitates control, let us review the elements of control in the context of information.&lt;ref name="Eilon"&gt;{{cite book |author=Samuel Eilon|title=Management control|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass.|year=1979|pages=|isbn=978-0-08-022482-4 |oclc=4193519|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship between the elements of control and real time information===

====Controlled characteristic or condition====
The primary requirement of a control system is that it maintains the level and kind of output necessary to achieve the system's objectives.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite book |author=James G March; Herbert A Simon|title= Organizations|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1958|pages=9–11|isbn=978-0-471-56793-6 |oclc=1329335}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually impractical to control every feature and condition associated with the system's output. Therefore, the choice of the controlled item (and appropriate information about it) is extremely important. There should be a direct correlation between the controlled item and the system's operation. In other words, control of the selected characteristic should have a direct relationship to the goal or objective of the system.

====Sensor====
After the [[:wikt:characteristic|characteristic]] is sensed, or measured, information pertinent to control is fed back. Exactly what information needs to be transmitted and also the language that will best facilitate the communication process and reduce the possibility of distortion in transmission must be carefully considered. Information that is to be compared with the standard, or plan, should be expressed in the same terms or language as in the original plan to facilitate decision making. Using machine methods (computers) may require extensive translation of the information. Since optimal languages for computation and for human review are not always the same, the relative ease of translation may be a significant factor in selecting the units of measurement or the language unit in the sensing element.

In many instances, the measurement may be sampled rather than providing a complete and continuous feedback of information about the operation. A sampling procedure suggests measuring some segment or portion of the operation that will represent the total.&lt;ref name="Mockler"/&gt;

====Comparison with standard====
In a [[social system]], the norms of acceptable behavior become the standard against which so-called [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] may be judged. Regulations and laws provide a more formal collection of information for society. Social norms change, but very slowly. In contrast, the standards outlined by a formal law can be changed from one day to the next through revision, discontinuation, or replacement by another.
Information about deviant behavior becomes the basis for controlling [[Social action|social activity]]. Output information is compared with the standard or norm and significant deviations are noted. In an industrial example, frequency distribution (a tabulation of the number of times a given characteristic occurs within the sample of products being checked) may be used to show the average quality, the spread, and the comparison of output with a standard.

If there is a significant and uncorrectable difference between output and plan, the system is "out of control." This means that the objectives of the system are not feasible in relation to the capabilities of the present design. Either the objectives must be reevaluated or the system redesigned to add new capacity or capability. For example, the traffic in drugs has been increasing in some cities at an alarming rate. The citizens must decide whether to revise the police system so as to regain control, or whether to modify the law to reflect a different norm of acceptable behavior.

====Implementor====
The activator unit responds to the [[information]] received from the comparator and initiates corrective action. If the system is a machine-to-machine system, the corrective inputs (decision rules) are designed into the network. When the control relates to a man-to-machine or man-to-man system, however, the individual(s) in charge must evaluate (1) the accuracy of the feedback information, (2) the significance of the variation, and (3) what corrective inputs will restore the system to a reasonable degree of stability. Once the decision has been made to direct new inputs into the [[system]], the actual process may be relatively easy. A small amount of energy can change the operation of jet airplanes, automatic steel mills, and hydroelectric power plants. The pilot presses a button, and the landing gear of the airplane goes up or down; the operator of a steel mill pushes a lever, and a ribbon of white-hot steel races through the plant; a worker at a control board directs the flow of electrical energy throughout a regional [[wikt:network|network]] of stations and substations. It takes but a small amount of control energy to release or stop large quantities of input.&lt;ref name="Eilon"/&gt;

The comparator may be located far from the [[operating system]], although at least some of the elements must be in close proximity to operations. For example, the measurement (the sensory element) is usually at the point of operations. The measurement information can be transmitted to a distant point for comparison with the standard (comparator), and when deviations occur, the correcting input can be released from the distant point. However, the input (activator) will be located at the operating system. This ability to control from afar means that aircraft can be flown by remote control, dangerous manufacturing processes can be operated from a safe distance, and national organizations can be directed from centralized headquarters in Dublin, Ireland.

==Process==
Step 1. Establishment of Standard.

Standards are the criteria against which actual performance will be measured. Standards are set in both quantitative and qualitative terms.

Step 2. Measurement of actual performance

Performance is measured in an objective and reliable manner. It should be checked in the same unit in which the standards are set.

Step 3. Comparing actual performance with standards.

Step 4. Analysis the cause of deviations.

Step 5. Taking corrective action.

==Kinds==
Control may be grouped according to three general classifications:&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;
# the nature of the information flow designed into the system (open- or closed-loop control)
# the kind of components included in the design (man or machine control systems)
# the relationship of control to the decision process (organizational or operational control).

===Open- and closed-loop control===

A street-lighting system controlled by a timing device is an example of an open-loop system. At a certain time each evening, a mechanical device closes the circuit and energy flows through the electric lines to light the lamps. Note, however, that the timing mechanism is an independent unit and is not measuring the objective function of the lighting system. If the lights should be needed on a dark, stormy day the timing device would not recognize this need and therefore would not activate energy inputs. Corrective properties may sometimes be built into the controller (for example, to modify the time the lights are turned on as the days grow shorter or longer), but this would not close the loop. In another instance, the sensing, comparison, or adjustment may be made through action taken by an individual who is not part of the system. For example, the lights may be turned on by someone who happens to pass by and recognizes the need for additional light.

If control is exercised as a result of the operation rather than because of outside or predetermined arrangements, it is a closed-loop system. The home thermostat is the classic example of a control device in a closed-loop system. When the room temperature drops below the desired point, the control mechanism closes the circuit to start the furnace and the temperature rises. The furnace-activating circuit is turned off as the temperature reaches the preselected level. The significant difference between this type of system and an open-loop system is that the control device is an element of the system it serves and measures the performance of the system. In other words, all four control elements are integral to the specific system.

An essential part of a closed-loop system is feedback; that is, the output of the system is measured continually through the item controlled, and the input is modified to reduce any difference or error toward zero. Many of the patterns of information flow in organizations are found to have the nature of closed loops, which use feedback. The reason for such a condition is apparent when one recognizes that any system, if it is to achieve a predetermined goal, must have available to it at all times an indication of its degree of attainment. In general, every goal-seeking system employs feedback.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

===Human and machine control===
The elements of control are easy to identify in machine systems. For example, the characteristic to be controlled might be some variable like speed or temperature, and the sensing device could be a speedometer or a thermometer. An expectation of precision exists because the characteristic is quantifiable and the standard and the normal variation to be expected can be described in exact terms. In automatic machine systems, inputs of information are used in a process of continual adjustment to achieve output specifications. When even a small variation from the standard occurs, the correction process begins. The automatic system is highly structured, designed to accept certain kinds of input and produce specific output, and programmed to regulate the transformation of inputs within a narrow range of variation.&lt;ref name="Anthony"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert N Anthony|title=The management control function|publisher=Harvard Business School Press|location=Boston, Mass.|year=1970|pages=14–17|isbn=978-0-87584-184-7 |oclc=18052725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an illustration of mechanical control: as the load on a steam engine increases and the engine starts to slow down, the regulator reacts by opening a valve that releases additional inputs of steam energy. This new input returns the engine to the desired number of revolutions per minute. This type of mechanical control is crude in comparison to the more sophisticated electronic control systems in everyday use. Consider the complex missile-guidance systems that measure the actual course according to predetermined mathematical calculations and make almost instantaneous corrections to direct the missile to its target.

Machine systems can be complex because of the sophisticated technology, whereas control of people is complex because the elements of control are difficult to determine. In human control systems, the relationship between objectives and associated characteristics is often vague; the measurement of the characteristic may be extremely subjective; the expected standard is difficult to define; and the amount of new inputs required is impossible to quantify. To illustrate, let us refer once more to a formalized social system in which deviant behavior is controlled through a process of observed violation of the existing law (sensing), court hearings and trials (comparison with standard), incarceration when the accused is found guilty (correction), and release from custody after rehabilitation of the individual has occurred.&lt;ref name="Anthony"/&gt;

The speed limit established for freeway driving is one standard of performance that is quantifiable, but even in this instance, the degree of permissible variation and the amount of the actual variation are often a subject of disagreement between the patrolman and the suspected violator. The complexity of our society is
reflected in many of our laws and regulations, which establish the general standards for economic, political, and social operations. A citizen may not know or understand the law and consequently would not know whether or not he was guilty of a violation.

Most organized systems are some combination of man and machine; some elements of control may be performed by machine whereas others are accomplished by man. In addition, some standards may be precisely structured whereas others may be little more than general guidelines with wide variations expected in output. Man must act as the controller when measurement is subjective and judgment is required. Machines such as computers are incapable of making exceptions from the specified control criteria regardless of how much a particular case might warrant special consideration. A pilot acts in conjunction with computers and automatic pilots to fly large jets. In the event of unexpected weather changes, or possible collision with another plane, he must intercede and assume direct control.&lt;ref name="Eilon"/&gt;

===Organizational and operational control===
The concept of organizational control is implicit in the bureaucratic theory of [[Max Weber]]. Associated with this theory are such concepts as "[[span of control]]", "closeness of supervision", and "hierarchical authority". Weber's view tends to include all levels or types of organizational control as being the same. More recently, writers have tended to differentiate the control process between that which emphasizes the nature of the organizational or systems design and that which deals with daily operations. To illustrate the difference, we "evaluate" the performance of a system to see how effective and efficient the design proved to be or to discover why it failed. In contrast, we operate and "control" the system with respect to the daily inputs of material, [[information]], and [[energy]]. In both instances, the elements of feedback are present, but organizational control tends to review and evaluate the nature and arrangement of components in the system, whereas operational control tends to adjust the daily inputs.

The direction for organizational control comes from the goals and strategic plans of the organization. General plans are translated into specific performance measures such as share of the [[Market (economics)|market]], [[earnings]], [[return on investment]], and [[budget]]s. The process of organizational control is to review and evaluate the performance of the system against these established norms. Rewards for meeting or exceeding standards may range from special recognition to [[salary]] increases or [[Promotion (marketing)|promotion]]s. On the other hand, a failure to meet expectations may signal the need to reorganize or redesign.&lt;ref name="Johnson1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Arvid Johnson|title=Management, systems, and society : an introduction|publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co.|location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.|year=1976 |pages=241–244|isbn=978-0-87620-540-2 |oclc=2299496}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''organizational control''', the approach used in the program of review and evaluation depends on the reason for the evaluation — ''that is, is it because the system is not effective (accomplishing its objectives)? Is the system failing to achieve an expected standard of efficiency? Is the evaluation being conducted because of a breakdown or failure in operations? Is it merely a periodic audit-and-review process?''

When a system has failed or is in great difficulty, special diagnostic techniques may be required to isolate the trouble areas and to identify the causes of the difficulty. It is appropriate to investigate areas that have been troublesome before or areas where some measure of performance can be quickly identified. For example, if an organization's output backlog builds rapidly, it is logical to check first to see if the problem is due to such readily obtainable measures as increased demand or to a drop in available man hours. When a more detailed analysis is necessary, a systematic procedure should be followed.&lt;ref name="Johnson1"/&gt;

In contrast to organizational control, '''operational control''' serves to regulate the day-to-day output relative to [[Schedule (workplace)|schedules]], [[specification]]s, and [[cost]]s. ''Is the output of product or service the proper [[Quality (business)|quality]] and is it available as scheduled? Are inventories of raw materials, goods-in-process, and finished products being purchased and produced in the desired quantities? Are the costs associated with the transformation process in line with cost estimates? Is the information needed in the transformation process available in the right form and at the right time? Is the energy resource being utilized efficiently?''

The most difficult task of management concerns monitoring the behavior of individuals, comparing performance to some standard, and providing rewards or punishment as indicated. Sometimes this control over people relates entirely to their output. For example, a [[Management|manager]] might not be concerned with the behavior of a salesman as long as sales were as high as expected. In other instances, close supervision of the [[salesman]] might be appropriate if achieving [[customer]] satisfaction were one of the sales organization's main [[goal|objective]]s.

The larger the unit, the more likely that the control characteristic will be related to some output goal. It also follows that if it is difficult or impossible to identify the actual output of individuals, it is better to measure the performance of the entire group. This means that individuals' levels of motivation and the measurement of their performance become subjective judgments made by the [[supervisor]]. Controlling output also suggests the difficulty of controlling individuals' performance and relating this to the total system's objectives.&lt;ref name="Johnson1"/&gt;

==Problems==
The perfect plan could be outlined if every possible variation of input could be anticipated and if the system would operate as predicted. This kind of planning is neither realistic, economical, nor feasible for most business systems. If it were feasible, planning requirements would be so complex that the system would be out of date before it could be operated. Therefore, we design control into systems. This requires more thought in the systems design but allows more flexibility of operations and makes it possible to operate a system using unpredictable components and undetermined input. Still, the design and effective operation of control are not without problems.

The objective of the system is to perform some specified function. 
The objective of organizational control is to see that the specified function is achieved. 
The objective of operational control is to ensure that variations in daily output are maintained within prescribed limits.

It is one thing to design a system that contains all of the elements of control, and quite another to make it operate true to the best objectives of design. Operating "in control" or "with plan" does not guarantee optimum performance. For example, the plan may not make the best use of the inputs of materials, energy, or information — in other words, the system may not be designed to operate efficiently. Some of the more typical problems relating to control include the difficulty of measurement, the problem of timing information flow, and the setting of proper standards.&lt;ref name="Johnson1"/&gt;

When objectives are not limited to quantitative output, the measurement of system effectiveness is difficult to make and subsequently perplexing to evaluate. Many of the characteristics pertaining to output do not lend themselves to quantitative measurement. This is true particularly when inputs of human energy cannot be related directly to output. The same situation applies to machines and other equipment associated with human involvement, when output is not in specific units. In evaluating man-machine or human-oriented systems, psychological and sociological factors obviously do not easily translate into quantifiable terms. ''For example, how does mental fatigue affect the quality or quantity of output? And, if it does, is mental fatigue a function of the lack of a challenging assignment or the fear of a potential injury? ''

Subjective inputs may be transferred into numerical data, but there is always the danger of an incorrect appraisal and transfer, and the danger that the analyst may assume undue confidence in such data after they have been quantified. Let us suppose, for example, that the decisions made by an executive are rated from 1 to 10, 10 being the perfect decision. After determining the ranking for each decision, adding these, and dividing by the total number of decisions made, the average ranking would indicate a particular executive's score in his decision-making role. On the basis of this score, judgments — which could be quite erroneous — might be made about his decision-making effectiveness. One executive with a ranking of 6.75 might be considered more effective than another who had a ranking of 6.25, and yet the two managers may have made decisions under different circumstances and conditions. External factors over which neither executive had any control may have influenced the difference in "effectiveness".&lt;ref name="Johnson1"/&gt;

Quantifying human behavior, despite its extreme difficulty, subjectivity, and imprecision in relation to measuring physical characteristics is the most prevalent and important measurement made in large systems. The behavior of individuals ultimately dictates the success or failure of every man-made system.

===Information flow===
[[File:Oscillation and Feedback.JPG|thumb|right|400 px|Oscillation and Feedback]] 
Another problem of control relates to the improper timing of information introduced into the feedback channel. Improper timing can occur in both computerized and human control systems, either by mistakes in measurement or in judgment. The more rapid the system's response to an error signal, the more likely it is that the system could overadjust; yet the need for prompt action is important because any delay in providing corrective input could also be crucial. A system generating feedback inconsistent with current need will tend to fluctuate and will not adjust in the desired manner.

The most serious [[problem]] in information flow arises when the delay in [[feedback]] is exactly one-half cycle, for then the corrective action is superimposed on a variation from norm which, at that moment, is in the same direction as that of the correction. This causes the system to overcorrect, and then if the reverse adjustment is made out of cycle, to correct too much in the other direction, and so on until the system fluctuates ("oscillates") out of control. This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure 1. “Oscillation and Feedback”. If, at Point A, the trend below standard is recognized and new inputs are added, but not until Point B, the system will overreact and go beyond the allowable limits. Again, if this is recognized at Point C, but inputs are not withdrawn until Point D, it will cause the system to drop below the lower limit of allowable variation.&lt;ref name="Johnson1"/&gt;

One solution to this problem rests in anticipation, which involves measuring not only the change but also the rate of change. The correction is outlined as a factor of the type and rate of the error. The difficulty also might be overcome by reducing the time lag between the measurement of the output and the adjustment to input. If a trend can be indicated, a time lead can be introduced to compensate for the time lag, bringing about consistency between the need for correction and the type and magnitude of the indicated action. It is usually more effective for an organization to maintain continuous measurement of its performance and to make small adjustments in operations constantly (this assumes a highly sensitive control system). Information feedback, consequently, should be timely and correct to be effective. That is, the information should provide an accurate indication of the status of the system.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

==Setting standards==
Setting the proper standards or control limits is a problem in many systems. Parents are confronted with this dilemma in expressing what they expect of their children, and business managers face the same issue in establishing standards that will be acceptable to employees. Some theorists have proposed that workers be allowed to set their own standards, on the assumption that when people establish their own goals, they are more apt to accept and achieve them.

Standards should be as precise as possible and communicated to all persons concerned. Moreover, communication alone is not sufficient; understanding is necessary. In human systems, standards tend to be poorly defined and the allowable range of deviation from standard also indefinite. For example, how many hours each day should a professor be expected to be available for student consultation? Or, what kind of behavior should be expected by students in the classroom? Discretion and personal judgment play a large part in such systems, to determine whether corrective action should be taken.

Perhaps the most difficult problem in human systems is the unresponsiveness of individuals to indicated correction. This may take the form of opposition and subversion to control, or it may be related to the lack of defined [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] or [[authority]] to take action. [[Leadership]] and positive motivation then become vital ingredients in achieving the proper response to input requirements.

Most control problems relate to design; thus the solution to these problems must start at that point. Automatic control systems, provided that human intervention is possible to handle exceptions, offer the greatest promise. There is a danger, however, that we may measure characteristics that do not represent effective performance (as in the case of the speaker who requested that all of the people who could not hear what he was saying should raise their hands), or that improper [[information]] may be communicated.&lt;ref name="Johnson1"/&gt;

[[File:Made in china.jpg|thumb|Country of origin label for a product designed in the United States, but manufactured in China.]] 
'''Country of origin''' ('''COO'''), is the [[sovereign state|country]] of [[manufacture]], production, or growth where an [[merchandise|article]] or product comes from.  There are differing [[rules of origin]] under various national laws and international treaties. Country of origin labelling is also known as ''place-based branding'', the ''made-in image'' or the "nationality bias." In some regions or industries, country of origin labelling may adopt unique local terms such as [[terroir]] used to describe wine appellations based on the specific region where grapes are grown and wine manufactured.

Place-based branding has a very ancient history. Archaeological evidence points to packaging specifying the place of manufacture dating back to some 4,000 years ago. Over time, informal labels evolved into formal, often regulated labels providing consumers with information about product quality, manufacturer name and place of origin.

==Definition==

Country of origin of a product can have several possible definitions. It can refer to:&lt;ref&gt;Field, A.J., Clark, G. and Sundstrom, W.A.,''Research in Economic History,'' Emerald Group Publishing, 2008, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;
: (a) "the place from which the merchandise was directly received; that is the last border crossed or port entered before reaching its final destination;
: (b) the country of consignment (i.e. from where the goods were sold); or,
: (c) the country of original growth or extraction."

==History of country-of-origin labelling==
[[File:Relitto di Sant'Andrea B (Elba).jpg|thumb|The distinctive shape and markings on amphorae provided consumers with information about the manufacturer and the place of origin for goods]]
The inclusion of place of origin on manufactured goods has an ancient history. In antiquity, informal branding which included details such as the name of manufacturer and place of origin were used by consumers as important clues as to product quality. David Wengrow has found archaeological evidence of brands, which often included origin of manufacture, dating to around 4,000 years ago. Producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which, over time, were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images, often associated with the producer's personal identity thus providing information about the product and its quality. For instance, an object found in a royal burial tomb in Abydos (southern Egypt) and dating to around 3,000 B.C.E., carries brand elements that would be very familiar to modern consumers.

In China, place-names appear to have developed independently during the Han Dynasty (220 BC-AD 200); brand names and place names were relatively commonplace on goods. Eckhardt and Bengtsson have argued that in the absence of a capitalist system, branding was connected to social systems and cultural contexts; that brand development was a consumer-initiated activity rather than the manufacturer-push normally associated with Western brand management practices.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhardt, G. and Bengtsson, A., "Pulling the White Rabbit Out of the Hat: Consuming Brands in Imperial China," ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' [European Conference Proceedings] Vol. 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eckhardt |first1=Giana M. |last2=Bengtsson |first2=Anders |title=A Brief History of Branding in China |journal=Journal of Macromarketing |date=10 November 2009 |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=210–221 |doi=10.1177/0276146709352219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana Twede has shown that amphorae used in Mediterranean trade between 1500 and 500 BCE exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings, which provided information for purchasers during exchange. Systematic use of stamped labels dates appears to date from around the fourth century BCE. In a largely pre-literate society, the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings functioned as a brand, conveying information about the contents, region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to function as signs of product quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Twede |first1=Diana |title=Commercial Amphoras: The Earliest Consumer Packages? |journal=Journal of Macromarketing |date=26 July 2016 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=98–108 |doi=10.1177/027467022001009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans preferred to purchase goods from specific places, such as oysters from [[Londinium]] and cinnamon from a specific mountain in Arabia, and these place-based preferences stimulated trade throughout Europe and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Paquet-Byrne, L., ''The Urge to Splurge: A Social History of Shopping,'' ECW Press, Toronto, Canada, 2003, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; In Pompeii and nearby Herculaneum, archaeological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use. Wine jars, for example, were stamped with names, such as  "Lassius" and "L. Eumachius;" probably references to the name of the producer. Carbonized loaves of bread, found at Herculaneum, indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producer's name.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, M., ''The Fires of Vesuvius: Pompeii Lost and Found,'' Harvard University Press, 2008; See Chapter 5, "Earning a Living: Baker, Banker and Garum Maker,"&lt;/ref&gt;

Umbricius Scauras, a manufacturer of fish sauce (also known as [[garum]]) in Pompeii c. 35 C.E., was branding his amphora which travelled across the entire Mediterranean. Mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of [[amphora]] bearing his personal brand and quality claims. The mosaic comprises four different amphora, one at each corner of the atrium, and bearing labels as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, J. R. in Dobbins, J. J. and Foss, P.

During the Medieval period in Europe, numerous [[market town]]s sprang up and competition between them intensified. In response to competitive pressures, towns began investing in developing a reputation for quality produce, efficient market regulation and good amenities for visitors. By the thirteenth century, English counties with important textile industries were investing in purpose built halls for the sale of cloth. London's [[Blackwell Hall]] became a centre for cloth, [[Bristol]] became associated with a particular type of cloth known as ''Bristol red'', [[Stroud]] was known for producing fine woollen cloth, the town of [[Worsted]] became synonymous with a type of yarn; [[Banbury]] and [[Essex]] were strongly associated with cheeses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Casson |first1=Mark |last2=Lee |first2=John S. |title=The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective |journal=The Business History Review |date=2011 |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=9–37 |jstor=41301368}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casson and Lee have argued that the chartered markets of England and Europe in medieval times were using the regional market's reputation as a sign of produce quality and that this acted as an early form of branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Casson |first1=Mark |last2=Lee |first2=John S. |title=The Origin and Development of Markets: A Business History Perspective |journal=Business History Review |date=11 May 2011 |volume=85 |issue=1 |pages=9–37 |doi=10.1017/S0007680511000018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the European age of expansion, goods were imported from afar. Marco Polo, for example, wrote about silk from China and spices from India. Consumers began to associate specific countries with merchandise - calico cloth from India, porcelain, silk and tea from China, spices from India and South-East Asia and tobacco, sugar, rum  and coffee from the New World.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, F. and Reynold, S., ''The Wheels of Commerce: Civilization and Capitalism, 15th to 18th Century,'' Berkely, CA, University of California Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century, European countries began introducing country of origin labelling legislation. In the 20th century, as markets became more global and trade barriers removed, consumers had access to a broader range of goods from almost anywhere in the world. Country of origin is an important consideration in purchase decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Maheswaran, D. and Chi, C.Y., "Nation Equity: Country of Origin Effects and Globalisation," in ''The SAGE Handbook of International Marketing,'' Masaaki Kotabe, Kristiaan Helsen (eds), Sage, 2009, pp 93-93&lt;/ref&gt;

Research shows that consumers' broad general perceptions of a country, including of its national characteristics, economic and political background, history, traditions, and representative products, combine to create an overall image or stereotype that is then attached to the products of that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nagashima |first1=Akira |title=A Comparison of Japanese and U.

The requirements for Country of Origin markings are complicated by the various designations which may be required such as "Made in X", "Product of X", "Manufactured in X" etc. They also vary by country of import and export. For example:

* For imports to the [[United Kingdom]], there is a voluntary code for Food. Other products are not subject to labelling requirements,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bis.gov.uk/files/file8134.pdf {{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}} Guidance Notes for Traders, retrieved 9 Oct. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; but misleading labelling can result in prosecution under the [[Trade Descriptions Act 1968]].
* Food exported to the [[United Arab Emirates]] must include Country of Origin&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fsis.usda.gov/regulations_&amp;_policies/United_Arab_Emirates_Requirements/index.asp {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925154006/http://www.fsis.usda.gov/Regulations_%26_Policies/United_Arab_Emirates_Requirements/index.asp |date=2012-09-25 }} US "Export Requirements for United Arab Emirates", retrieved 9 Oct. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Ford Hubcap Made in USA.jpg|thumb|Ford automobile hubcap]]
Section 304 of the [[Tariff Act of 1930]] as amended ({{usc|19|1304}}) requires most imports,{{which|date=January 2013}} including many food items, to bear labels informing the ultimate purchaser of their country of origin. Meats, produce, and several other raw agricultural products generally were exempt. The [[2002 farm bill]] (P.L. 107-171, Sec. 10816), however, contains a requirement that many retail establishments provide, starting on September 30, 2004, country-of-origin information on fresh fruits and vegetables, red meats, seafood, and peanuts. However, the consolidated FY2004 appropriation (P.L. 108-199) signed January 23, 2004, delayed this requirement for two years except for seafood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810044532/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=August 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Textile Fiber Products Identification Act]] and [[Wool Products Labeling Act]] require a [[Made in USA]] label on clothing and other textile or wool household products if the final product is manufactured in the U.S. of fabric that is manufactured in the U.S., regardless of where materials earlier in the manufacturing process (for example, the yarn and fiber) came from. Textile products that are imported must be labeled as required by the Customs Service. A textile or wool product partially manufactured in the U.S. and partially manufactured in another country must be labeled to show both foreign and domestic processing.

On a garment with a neck, the country of origin must be disclosed on the front of a label attached to the inside center of the neck, either midway between the shoulder seams or very near another label attached to the inside center of the neck. On a garment without a neck and on other kinds of textile products, the country of origin must appear on a conspicuous and readily accessible label on the inside or outside of the product.

Catalogs and other mail order promotional materials for textile and wool products, including those disseminated on the Internet, must disclose whether a product is made in the U.S., imported, or both.

The [[Fur Products Labeling Act]] requires the country of origin of imported furs to be disclosed on all labels and in all advertising.

The [[American Automobile Labeling Act]] requires that each automobile manufactured on or after October 1, 1994, for sale in the U.S. bear a label disclosing where the car was assembled, the percentage of equipment that originated in the U.S. and Canada, and the country of origin of the engine and transmission. Any representation that a car marketer makes that is required by the AALA is exempt from the Commission’s policy. When a company makes claims in advertising or promotional materials that go beyond the AALA requirements, it will be held to the Commission’s standard.

The [[Buy American Act]] requires that a product be manufactured in the U.S. of more than 50 percent U.S. parts to be considered Made in USA for government procurement purposes. For more information, review the Buy American Act at 41 U.S.C. §§ 10a-10c, the Federal Acquisition Regulations at 48 C.F.R. Part 25, and the Trade Agreements Act at 19 U.S.C. §§ 2501-2582.

The [[Lanham Act]] gives any person (such as a competitor) who is damaged by a false designation of origin the right to sue the party making the false claim.

===COO marketing===
Companies may indicate the origin of their products with a number of different marketing strategies:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aichner |first1=Thomas |title=Country-of-origin marketing: A list of typical strategies with examples |journal=Journal of Brand Management |date=15 November 2013 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=81–93 |doi=10.1057/bm.2013.24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Use of the phrase "Made in..."
* Use of quality and origin labels
* COO embedded in the company name
* Typical COO words embedded in the company name
* Use of the COO language
* Use of famous or stereotypical people from the COO
* Use of COO flags and symbols
* Use of typical landscapes or famous buildings from the COO

==International trade==
{{further|Rules of origin}}
When shipping products from one country to another, the products may have to be marked with country of origin, and the country of origin will generally be required to be indicated in the export/import documents and governmental submissions. Country of origin will affect its admissibility, the rate of duty, its entitlement to special duty or [[trade preference]] programs, [[antidumping]], and [[government procurement]].

Today, many products are an outcome of a large number of parts and pieces that come from many different countries, and that may then be assembled together in a third country. In these cases, it's hard to know exactly what is the country of origin, and different rules apply as to how to determine their "correct" country of origin. Generally, articles only change their country of origin if the work or material added to an article in the second country constitutes a substantial transformation, or, the article changes its name, tariff code, character or use (for instance from wheel to car). Value added in the second country may also be an issue.

In principle, the ''substantial transformation'' of a product is intended as a change in the [[harmonized system]] coding. For example, a rough commodity sold from country ''A'' to country ''B'', than subjected of a transformation in country ''B'', which sells the final processed commodity to a country ''C'' is considered a sufficient step to label the end product ''made in B''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://images.to.camcom.it/f/EIC/15/15408_CCIAATO_23102012.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304042637/http://images.to.camcom.it/f/EIC/15/15408_CCIAATO_23102012.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diagonal Mar i el Front Marítim del Poblenou''' is a neighborhood in the [[Sant Martí (district)|Sant Martí]] district of [[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].

The area between the seafront, [[Sant Adrià de Besòs]] and the [[Besòs river]] was previously made up of slums and poor areas surrounding the neighbourhoods of [[La Mina]], [[El Maresme]] and [[Poblenou]]. Under the new name Diagonal Mar, in reference to its proximity to the sea and [[Avinguda Diagonal]], renovation started taking place in the late 1990s. Still ongoing, this has been one of the most ambitions [[urban regeneration]] schemes, and also one of the most controversial and a perceived departure from Barcelona's well-established urban model. The real estate company [[Hines Interests Limited Partnership|Hines]] was in charge of most relevant decisions about urbanism in the area, although it was ESPAIS Promocions Immobiliaries, a local real estate developer, who developed the majority of the residential towers, including [[Illa de la Llum]], Illa del Bosc, Illa del Cell and [[Illa del Mar]]. This has been criticised by renowned local architects such as [[Oriol Bohigas]], [[Juli Capellas]] or [[Josep Maria Montaner]] or urbanism scholar [[Llàtzer Moix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Xavier Mas de Xaxàs | title=Miami contra Cerdà | work=La Vanguardia | date=25 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most renovation in the area was ready in time for the [[2004 Universal Forum of Cultures|2004 Cultural Forum]], which took place in the [[International Convention Centre of Barcelona]] (CCIB). It includes [[Catalunya]]'s largest shopping center [[Centre Comercial Diagonal Mar]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elmundo.es/papel/hemeroteca/2000/09/29/catalunya/898680.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Parc de Diagonal Mar]], designed by [[Enric Miralles]] and [[Benedetta Tagliabue]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/santmarti/ca/diagonal-mar-i-el-front-maritim-del-poblenou "Diagonal Mar i el Front Marítim del Poblenou"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beaches==
Beaches in Diagonal Mar are family oriented and more quiet then downtown beaches. Proximity to the nudist beaches closer to the city does however bother some visitors.{{weasel-inline|date=May 2014}} The two beaches located in Diagonal Mar are [[La Mar Bella]] and [[La Nova Mar Bella]].

'''Disagree and commit''' is a management principle which states that individuals are allowed to disagree while a decision is being made, but that once a decision has been made, everybody must commit to it. The principle can also be understood as a statement about ''when'' it is useful to have conflict and disagreement, with the principle saying disagreement is useful in early states of [[decision-making]] while harmful after a decision has been made.&lt;ref name="Origbo"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://seekingmastery.wordpress.com/2017/05/29/make-disagree-and-commit-work-for-you/ | title = Make "Disagree and Commit" Work for You | website = Seeking Mastery | publisher = WordPress.com | first = Efesa | last = Origbo | date = May 29, 2017 | accessdate = July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disagree and commit is a method of avoiding the consensus trap, in which the lack of consensus leads to inaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://encyclopedia.uia.org/en/problem/140262 | title = Consensus trap {{!}} World Problems &amp; Global Issues | publisher = ''[[Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential|The Encyclopedia of World Problems]]'' | accessdate = July 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Cj9s1QihGPIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else in Business | first = Patrick | last = Lencioni | date = March 14, 2012 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | quote = Great teams avoid the consensus trap by embracing a concept that Intel, the legendary microchip manufacturer, calls "disagree and commit."

==History==

[[Scott McNealy]] used the phrase as early as sometime between 1983 and 1991, as part of the line "Agree and commit, disagree and commit, or get out of the way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rQl4169IA4kC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=disagree%20and%20commit%20scott%20mcnealy&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=disagree%20and%20commit%20scott%20mcnealy&amp;f=false | title = High Noon: The Inside Story of Scott McNealy and the Rise of Sun Microsystems | first = Karen | last = Southwick | year = 1999 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.| isbn = 9780471297130 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39}}&lt;ref name="Origbo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://ecorner.stanford.edu/1642.ect | title = Agree and Commit, Disagree and Commit | first = Greg | last = Ballard | date = November 15, 2006 | publisher = Stanford eCorner | quote = This is a phrase, agree and commit, disagree and commit, that actually comes from Scott McNealy. At least that's where I was told it was from.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept has also been attributed to [[Andrew Grove]] at [[Intel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.inc.com/magazine/201412/patrick-lencioni/innovation-wont-get-you-very-far.html | title = Why Great Leadership Fuels Innovation | date = November 20, 2014 | publisher = Inc.com | first = Patrick | last = Lencioni | accessdate = July 2, 2017 | quote = At Intel, Grove demanded not only that his people argue well, but also that they leave those argument-rich meetings fully committed to the decisions that had been made.

[[Amazon.com|Amazon]] added "Have a Backbone; Disagree and Commit" as one of its leadership principles sometime in 2010–2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.amazon.com/Values-Careers-Homepage/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=239365011 | title = Amazon.com: Amazon Values | deadurl = bot: unknown | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110522092317/http://www.amazon.com/Values-Careers-Homepage/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=239365011 | archivedate = 2011-05-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amazon CEO [[Jeff Bezos]] mentioned the term in his "2016 Letter to Shareholders".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/p/feature/z6o9g6sysxur57t | title = About Amazon - 2016 Letter to Shareholders | accessdate = July 2, 2017 | date = April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[microeconomics]], '''economies of scale''' are the cost advantages that  enterprises obtain due to their scale of operation (typically measured by amount of output produced), with cost per unit of output decreasing with increasing scale. (In economics, "scale" is synonymous with quantity.)

Economies of scale apply to a variety of organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a business or manufacturing unit, plant or an entire enterprise. When average costs start falling as output increases, then economies of scale are occurring. If a firm's [[Marginal_cost|marginal cost]] of producing a good or service is beneath its [[Average_cost|average cost]] of producing that good or service, then the firm is experiencing economies of scale.
Some economies of scale, such as capital cost of manufacturing facilities and friction loss of transportation and industrial equipment, have a [[Economies of scale#Physical and engineering basis|physical or engineering basis]].

Another source of scale economies is the possibility of purchasing inputs at a lower per-unit cost when they are purchased in large quantities.

The economic concept dates back to [[Adam Smith]] and the idea of obtaining larger production returns through the use of division of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Economies of scale often have limits, such as passing the optimum design point where costs per additional unit begin to increase.  Common limits include exceeding the nearby raw material supply, such as wood in the lumber, [[pulp and paper industry]]. A common limit for low cost per unit weight commodities is saturating the regional market, thus having to ship product uneconomical distances. Other limits include using energy less efficiently or having a higher defect rate.

Large producers are usually efficient at long runs of a product grade (a commodity) and find it costly to switch grades frequently.  They will therefore avoid specialty grades even though they have higher margins.  Often smaller (usually older) manufacturing facilities remain viable by changing from commodity grade production to specialty products.&lt;ref&gt;Manufacture of specialty grades by small scale producers is a common practice in steel, paper and many commodity industries today.  See various industry trade publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The simple meaning of economies of scale is doing things more efficiently with increasing size or speed of operation.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Economies of scale often rely on [[fixed cost]]s, which are constant and don't vary with output, and [[Variable cost|variable costs]], which can be affected with the amount of output. In wholesale and retail distribution, increasing the speed of operations, such as order fulfillment, lowers the cost of both fixed and [[working capital]]. Other common sources of economies of scale are [[Purchase|purchasing]] (bulk buying of materials through long-term contracts), managerial (increasing the specialization of managers), financial (obtaining lower-[[interest]] charges when borrowing from banks and having access to a greater range of financial instruments), [[marketing]] (spreading the cost of advertising over a greater range of output in [[media market]]s), and technological (taking advantage of [[returns to scale]] in the production function). Each of these factors reduces the [[long run average cost]]s (LRAC) of production by shifting the [[cost curve|short-run average total cost (SRATC) curve]] down and to the right.

Economies of scale is a practical concept that may explain real-world phenomena such as patterns of international trade or the number of firms in a market. The exploitation of economies of scale helps explain why companies grow large in some industries. It is also a justification for [[free trade]] policies, since some economies of scale may require a larger market than is possible within a particular country—for example, it would not be efficient for [[Liechtenstein]] to have its own carmaker if they only sold to their local market. A lone carmaker may be profitable, but even more so if they exported cars to global markets in addition to selling to the local market. Economies of scale also play a role in a "[[natural monopoly]]". There is a distinction between two types of economies of scale: internal and external. An industry that exhibits an internal economy of scale is one where the costs of production fall when the number of firms in the industry drops, but the remaining firms increase their production to match previous levels. Conversely, an industry exhibits an external economy of scale when costs drop due to the introduction of more firms, thus allowing for more efficient use of specialized services and machinery. 

The management thinker and translator of the [[Toyota Production System]] for service, Professor [[John Seddon]], argues that attempting to create economies by increasing scale is powered by myth in the service sector. Instead, he believes that economies will come from improving the flow of a service, from the first receipt of a customer’s demand to the eventual satisfaction of that demand. In trying to manage and reduce unit costs, firms often raise total costs by creating [[failure demand]]. Seddon claims that arguments for an economy of scale are a mix of (a) the plausibly obvious and (b) a little hard data, brought together to produce two broad assertions, for which there is little hard factual evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/connected_republic/attachments/33/Why_do_we_believe_in_economy_of_scale.pdf|format=PDF|title=Why do we believe in economy of scale? : Professor John Seddon, managing director Vanguard|date=July 2010|website=S3.amazonaws.com|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical and engineering basis==
Some of the economies of scale recognized in engineering have a physical basis, such as the [[square-cube law]], by which the surface of a vessel increases by the square of the dimensions while the volume increases by the cube.  This law has a direct effect on the capital cost of such things as buildings, factories, pipelines, ships and airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;See various estimating guides, such as Means.  Also see various engineering economics texts related to plant design and construction, etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In structural engineering, the strength of [[Beam (structure)|beam]]s increases with the cube of the thickness.

[[Drag (physics)|Drag]] loss of vehicles like aircraft or ships generally increases less than proportional with increasing cargo volume, although the physical details can be quite complicated. Therefore, making them larger usually results in less fuel consumption per ton of cargo at a given speed.

Heat losses from industrial processes vary per unit of volume for pipes, tanks and other vessels in a relationship somewhat similar to the square-cube law.&lt;ref&gt;The relationship is rather complex.  See engineering texts on heat transfer.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital and operating cost===

Overall costs of capital projects are known to be subject to economies of scale.  A crude estimate is that if the capital cost for a given sized piece of equipment is known, changing the size will change the capital cost by the 0.6 power of the capacity ratio (the point six power rule).&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite journal

Often operational efficiency is also greater with increasing scale, leading to lower variable cost as well. Economies of scale apply to a variety of organizational and business situations and at various levels, such as a business or manufacturing unit, plant or an entire enterprise.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In practice, capital cost estimates are prepared from specifications, budget grade vendor pricing for equipment, general arrangement drawings and materials take-offs from the drawings.  This information is then used in cost formulas to arrive at a final detailed estimate.&lt;/ref&gt;

In estimating capital cost, it typically requires an insignificant amount of labor, and possibly not much more in materials, to install a larger capacity electrical wire or pipe having significantly greater capacity.&lt;ref&gt;See various estimating guides that publish tables of tasks commonly encountered in building trades with estimates of labor hours and costs per hour for the trade, often with regional pricing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cost of a unit of capacity of many types of equipment, such as electric motors, centrifugal pumps, diesel and gasoline engines, decreases as size increases.  Also, the efficiency increases with size.&lt;ref&gt;See various engineering handbooks and manufacturers data.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crew size and other operating costs for ships, trains and airplanes===

Operating crew size for ships, airplanes, trains, etc., does not increase in direct proportion to capacity.&lt;ref&gt;

Many aircraft models were significantly lengthened or "stretched" to increase payload.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenberg|1982|pp=127–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many manufacturing facilities, especially those making bulk materials like chemicals, refined petroleum products, cement and paper, have labor requirements that are not greatly influenced by changes in plant capacity.  This is because labor requirements of automated processes tend to be based on the complexity of the operation rather than production rate, and many manufacturing facilities have nearly the same basic number of processing steps and pieces of equipment, regardless of production capacity.

===Economical use of byproducts===

[[Karl Marx]] noted that large scale manufacturing allowed economical use of products that would otherwise be waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosenberg|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marx cited the chemical industry as an example, which today along with petrochemicals, remains highly dependent on turning various residual reactant streams into salable products.  In the pulp and paper industry it is economical to burn bark and fine wood particles to produce [[process steam]] and to recover the spent pulping chemicals for conversion back to a usable form.

==Economies of scale and returns to scale==

Economies of scale is related to and can easily be confused with the theoretical economic notion of returns to scale.  Where economies of scale refer to a firm's costs, returns to scale describe the relationship between inputs and outputs in a long-run (all inputs variable) production function. A production function has ''constant'' returns to scale if increasing all inputs by some proportion results in output increasing by that same proportion. Returns are ''decreasing'' if, say, doubling inputs results in less than double the output, and ''increasing'' if more than double the output.  If a mathematical function is used to represent the production function, and if that production function is [[homogeneous function|homogeneous]], returns to scale are represented by the degree of homogeneity of the function.  Homogeneous production functions with constant returns to scale are first degree homogeneous, increasing returns to scale are represented by degrees of homogeneity greater than one, and decreasing returns to scale by degrees of homogeneity less than one.

If the firm is a perfect competitor in all input markets, and thus the per-unit prices of all its inputs are unaffected by how much of the inputs the firm purchases, then it can be shown that at a particular level of output, the firm has economies of scale if and only if it has increasing returns to scale, has diseconomies of scale if and only if it has decreasing returns to scale, and has neither economies nor diseconomies of scale if it has constant returns to scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gelles |first=Gregory M. |last2=Mitchell |first2=Douglas W. |title=Returns to Scale and Economies of Scale: Further Observations |journal=Journal of Economic Education |volume=27 |date=1996 |issue=3 |pages=259–261 |jstor=1183297 |doi=10.1080/00220485.1996.10844915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frisch |first=R. |authorlink=Ragnar Frisch |title=Theory of Production |location=Dordrecht |publisher=D. Reidel |date=1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=C. E. |title=The Neoclassical Theory of Production &amp;amp; Distribution |location=London |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=1969 |isbn=0-521-07453-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this case, with [[perfect competition]] in the output market the long-run equilibrium will involve all firms operating at the minimum point of their long-run average cost curves (i.e., at the borderline between economies and diseconomies of scale).

If, however, the firm is not a perfect competitor in the input markets, then the above conclusions are modified.  For example, if there are increasing returns to scale in some range of output levels, but the firm is so big in one or more input markets that increasing its purchases of an input drives up the input's per-unit cost, then the firm could have diseconomies of scale in that range of output levels.  Conversely, if the firm is able to get bulk discounts of an input, then it could have economies of scale in some range of output levels even if it has decreasing returns in production in that output range.

The literature assumed that due to the competitive nature of [[reverse auction]]s, and in order to compensate for lower prices and lower margins, suppliers seek higher volumes to maintain or increase the total revenue. Buyers, in turn, benefit from the lower transaction costs and economies of scale that result from larger volumes. In part as a result, numerous studies have indicated that the procurement volume must be sufficiently high to provide sufficient profits to attract enough suppliers, and provide buyers with enough savings to cover their additional costs.&lt;ref name="ShalevAsbjornsen2010"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shalev |first=Moshe Eitan |last2=Asbjornsen |first2=Stee |title=Electronic Reverse Auctions and the Public Sector – Factors of Success |journal=Journal of Public Procurement |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=428–452 |date=2010 |ssrn=1727409 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, surprisingly enough, Shalev and Asbjornse found, in their research based on 139 reverse auctions conducted in the public sector by public sector buyers, that the higher auction volume, or economies of scale, did not lead to better success of the auction. They found that auction volume did not correlate with competition, nor with the number of bidders, suggesting that auction volume does not promote additional competition. They noted, however, that their data included a wide range of products, and the degree of competition in each market varied significantly, and offer that further research on this issue should be conducted to determine whether these findings remain the same when purchasing the same product for both small and high volumes. Keeping competitive factors constant, increasing auction volume may further increase competition.&lt;ref name="ShalevAsbjornsen2010" /&gt;

== Distributional consequences ==
In his 1844 ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844|Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts]]'', [[Karl Marx]] observes that economies of scale have historically been associated with an increasing concentration of private wealth and have been used to justify such concentration. Marx points out that concentrated private ownership of large-scale economic enterprises is a historically contingent fact, and not essential to the nature of such enterprises. In the case of agriculture, for example, Marx calls attention to the [[wikt:sophistry|sophistical]] nature of the arguments used to justify the system of concentrated ownership of land:

: As for large landed property, its defenders have always sophistically identified the economic advantages offered by large-scale agriculture with large-scale landed property, as if it were not precisely as a result of the abolition of property that this advantage, for one thing, received its greatest possible extension, and, for another, only then would be of social benefit.&lt;ref name=marx1844&gt;[[Karl Marx]], ''[[Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844]]'', M. Milligan, trans. (1988), p. 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of concentrated private ownership of land, Marx recommends that economies of scale should instead be realized by [[Cooperative|associations]]:

:Association, applied to land, shares the economic advantage of large-scale landed property, and first brings to realization the original tendency inherent in land-division, namely, equality. In the same way association re-establishes, now on a rational basis, no longer mediated by serfdom, overlordship and the silly mysticism of property, the intimate ties of man with the earth, for the earth ceases to be an object of huckstering, and through free labor and free enjoyment becomes once more a true personal property of man.&lt;ref name=marx1844/&gt;

[[Hajji|Hajjah]] '''Fatimah binte Sulaiman''' ({{H:title|Both of these years are estimates|1754? &amp;ndash; 1852?}}), also known as '''Hajjah Fatimah''' and as the '''"Sultana of [[Gowa Regency|Gowa]]"''', was a Singaporean merchant and philanthropist. After the death of her second husband, she combined his business with her own boats and built it into a successful naval trading operation. Fatimah is best known for commissioning the mosque that bears her name, [[Masjid Hajjah Fatimah]]. In recognition for her philanthropy in funding the creation of the mosque, as well as homes for the poor that were adjacent to it, Faimah was inducted into the [[Singapore Women's Hall of Fame]] in 2014.

==Background==
Fatimah binte Sulaiman was born in [[Malacca]], [[Malaysia]], to a family of successful traders. Her year of birth is not certain, but is believed to be 1754. After the collapse of an unsuccessful first marriage, she married Daing Chanda Pulih, a [[Bugis]] prince and merchant from [[South Sulawesi]] (then known as Celebes).&lt;ref name=SI_2003&gt;{{cite web|last1=Azrah|first1=Edian|title=Hajjah Fatimah|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_685_2005-01-12.html|website=Singapore Infopedia|publisher=[[National Library Board]]|accessdate=11 November 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224114151/http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_685_2005-01-12.html|archivedate=24 December 2014|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SWHF_15NOV11&gt;{{cite web|title=Hajjah Fatimah binte Sulaiman|url=http://www.swhf.sg/the-inductees/name/13-community-social-work/126-hajjah-fatimah-binte-sulaiman|website=[[Singapore Women's Hall of Fame]]|publisher=Singapore Council of Women's Organisations|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulih had a trading post in Singapore, and brought Fatimah binte Sulaiman with him to the island.&lt;ref name=CS_12JUNE15&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ho|first1=Joyce|title=Hajjah Fatimah Mosque|url=http://comesingapore.com/travel-guide/article/303/hajjah-fatimah-mosque|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223080123/http://comesingapore.com/travel-guide/article/303/hajjah-fatimah-mosque|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 December 2010|website=ComeSingapore.com|publisher=Travelogy|accessdate=11 November 2015|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pulih died while Fatimah was still young, and she combined his business with her own boats and built a successful [[steamship]] and [[sailboat]]-based trading operation.&lt;ref name=TSWHF_15NOV12/&gt;&lt;ref name=NHB_15NOV11&gt;{{cite web|title=Masjid Hajjah Fatimah |url=http://www.nhb.gov.sg/places/trails/kampong-glam/trail-ii/trail-sites/places-of-worship/masjid-hajjah-fatimah |website=[[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]] |accessdate=11 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123030110/http://www.nhb.gov.sg/places/trails/kampong-glam/trail-ii/trail-sites/places-of-worship/masjid-hajjah-fatimah |archivedate=23 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before her husband died, Fatimah had a daughter with him, Raja Siti. Raja would go on to marry [[Sayyid Ahmad ibn ‘Abdur-Rahman As-Saqqaf]], whose [[Alsagoff Family|family]] would become known for their philanthropy, like Fatimah herself.&lt;ref name=SI_2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NHB_15NOV11 /&gt;

Fatimah is commonly referred to as "[[Hajji|Hajjah]] Fatimah", indicating that she made the a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], or [[Hajj]].&lt;ref name=NHB_15NOV11 /&gt; The exact date of her death is unknown, but her family claims that Fatimah lived to the age of 98.&lt;ref name="SI_2003" /&gt; She is buried on the grounds of the [[Masjid Hajjah Fatimah]], along with her husband, her daughter and son-in-law's, and several of their descendants.&lt;ref name=SI_2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SWHF_15NOV11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NHB_12NOV15&gt;{{cite web|title=Hajjah Fatimah Mosque |url=http://www.nhb.gov.sg/places/sites-and-monuments/national-monuments/hajjah-fatimah-mosque |website=National Heritage Board |accessdate=12 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122215424/http://www.nhb.gov.sg/places/sites-and-monuments/national-monuments/hajjah-fatimah-mosque |archivedate=22 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Masjid Hajjah Fatimah==

Fatimah's wealth led to her becoming known as the "Sultana of [[Gowa Regency|Gowa]]". It also made her residence in [[Kampong Glam]] the target of thieves, who burgled it twice and set it on fire during the second burglary.&lt;ref name=SI_2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CS_12JUNE15 /&gt; After the fire, Fatimah &amp;mdash; thankful that she was not present for the burglaries and thus was not harmed &amp;mdash; donated money and the land that her house was on in provide for the construction of a mosque, which became the [[Masjid Hajjah Fatimah]]. Fatimah rebuilt her own house, and also funded the construction of houses for the poor, in the land adjacent to the new.&lt;ref name=SWHF_15NOV11 /&gt; The Masjid Hajjah Fatimah is one of only a small number of mosques that are named after women.&lt;ref name=NHB_12NOV15 /&gt;

For her philanthropy and role in establishing the mosque that bears her name, Hajjah Fatimah binte Sulaiman was inducted into the [[Singapore Women's Hall of Fame]] in 2014, the Hall of Fame's inaugural year.&lt;ref name=TSWHF_15NOV12/&gt; She had previously been honored in a nine-member Wall of Fame that evolved into the larger Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=SWHF_15NOV11 /&gt;&lt;ref name=TSWHF_15NOV12&gt;{{cite web|title=The Singapore Women's Hall of Fame|url=http://www.swhf.sg/about/an-overview|website=Singapore Women's Hall of Fame|publisher=Singapore Council of Women's Organisations|accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gabriel Milan''' (or Gavrī'el Mil'ō (גבריאל מילאו), ''c'' 1631 &amp;ndash; 26 March 1689) was governor of the [[Danish West Indies]] (now known as the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]]) from 7 May 1684 to 27 February 1686. Though he mainly went by the name of 'Gabriel Milan', he identified himself as '''''Don Franco de Tebary Cordova''''' in his correspondence with King [[Frederick III of Denmark]]. Like many of the early Danish West Indies governors, Milan's term was short and stormful, as he disagreed with the Danish management on several issues. He was called to Denmark after less than two years and executed after a lengthy trial.

== Early life ==
Milan came from a reputable [[Sephardic Jew]]ish family, likely from [[Spain]], and had connections in [[Portugal]], [[Flanders]], and [[Hamburg]]. Some genealogists note that he is the son of Manuel Cardoso de Millao and Sara de Caceres.&lt;ref&gt;Heymann, [http://www.heymannfamily.com/web/HeymannGed4Web-J6/n_2efa.html#0 Heymann Family Web Site], accessed February 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  At some point, his family was forced into a [[Catholic]] [[baptism]],&lt;ref&gt;Terslin, Milan, 9&lt;/ref&gt; however, they had re-assumed their Jewish identity by the time of Milan's life.&lt;ref&gt;Locker, 'Yehūdīm', 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milan was first married to the daughter of [[Benjamin Musaphia]], a [[Jew]]ish scholar and author of a number of scientific works regarding [[archaeology]], [[Semitic languages|Semite]] [[philology]], and [[alchemy]].  His wife's given name was not recorded in any sources, except that her last name was [[De Castro]] and her family's [[coat of arms]] depicted a [[negro]] head.&lt;ref name="Terslin, Milan, 10"&gt;Terslin, Milan, 10&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, his family was related by marriage to the well-known [[Portugal|Portuguese]]-Jewish houses of [[da Costa]].&lt;ref name="Terslin, Milan, 10"/&gt; Among the people connected to this family was [[Emanuel Teixiera Cardosa de Milan]] (also known as ''Isaac Haim Senior Teixeira'' &amp;ndash; d. 1705), a wealthy merchant of the [[Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg]] who was Milan's uncle by marriage. Another of Milan's uncles was [[Moseh Abenzur]], a shipowner and [[Jewellery|jeweller]] who was also known by the names, ''Paulo de Milao,'' ''Milan'', and ''Poul Didricksen''.&lt;ref name="Terslin, Milan, 13"&gt;Terslin, Milan, 13&lt;/ref&gt; Moseh's oldest son, [[Josua Abenzur]], was the brother-in-law of Milan and in his early dealings, Milan often borrowed money from Josua.

Milan begun his career as a soldier, notably as a [[colonel]] in the Spanish [[cavalry]] in Flanders (1654–55).  He participated in the [[Thirty Years' War]] on the [[Spain|Spanish]] side against [[France]] in 1657,&lt;ref name="Terslin, Milan, 13"/&gt; and fought at the [[Battle of the Dunes (1658)|Battle of Dunkerque]]. During this period, Milan was living in [[Brussels]] and later served under [[Cardinal Mazarin]].

In 1667, Milan was an [[Amsterdam]] merchant, concerned with financing [[Prince George of Denmark]].  In 1668, he was made Danish [[Factor (agent)|Factor]], and, in 1670, Factor-General in Amsterdam.  In this capacity, Milan composed reports on political and commercial matters, which afforded him confidential relations with various important people at the Danish Court. Here Milan learned to speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]],  [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[German language|German]], and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

Milan's first wife died in 1675, leaving behind two children.  Shortly thereafter, Milan married the widow [[Juliane Regina von Breitenbach]]. With Juliane, Milan had five children (see [[#The children of Gabriel Milan|The children of Gabriel Milan]]).

By 1684, the affairs of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] were moving too swiftly for the comfort of the directors at Copenhagen.  [[George Iversen]], the first Governor of St. Thomas, recounted that he was forced to conform to [[Adolph Esmit]] and later, Esmit's older brother, [[Nicolai Esmit|Nicolai]], and was held in his office until a new incumbent was secured.  The patience of the English government was exhausted, and they had no interest in hearing Esmit's complaints.  At a [[shareholders' meeting]] on March 10, the directors of the Danish company were asked to choose a new Governor.

Two candidates presented themselves, Balthasar Lachmann, who was an [[auditor]], and Gabriel Milan.  Milan was selected because for his [[linguistics|linguistic]] knowledge and business ability.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The recommendation, dated March 14, was signed by the executive committee of the directors, consisting of [[Albert Gyldensparre]], a brother of the disgraced Count Griffenfeld; Abraham Wüst, later to become a member of the Board of Trade; and Edward Holst.  On May 7, 1684, the King issued an order that deposed Adolph Esmit and named Gabriel Milan as Governor of St. Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Christian V. to A. Esmit.  A. E., 1682-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governorship ==
To take the new governorship and his retinue over to the West Indies, the King set aside the warship ''Fortuna'', armed with forty guns, and provided the ship with a crew of eighty men. Captain George Meyer, a German-speaking officer who was in the Danish service for five years, commanded the boat.  Milan brought his family (his wife; his grown son, Felix; and his other four children), a [[governess]], three [[maid]]s, three [[Lackey (manservant)|lackeys]] and [[Labour (economics)|laborer]], and a [[Tartars|Tartar]].&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The directors also sent Niels Lassen as Lieutenant Governor of sorts, and John Lorentz to serve as an assistant.

Lavish provisions were made for the Governor's comfort. Various foreign wines were on board, and place was found for six to seven dogs.  The King furnished Milan with 6,000 [[Danish West Indian rigsdaler|rigsdaler]] (rdl) cash for Milan's immediate needs and gave him part of his salary in advance.  Captain Meyer was entrusted with the secret order directing that, in case of Milan's death, Lassen would succeed him as the Governor.  In case of Lassen's death, Lieutenant [[Christopher Heins]] of St. Thomas would take charge.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Milan tried in vain to get an appointment to the Board of Trade on the ground that he knew the tricks of traders and [[Bureau de Change|money-changers]], and he accumulated a list of claims against his royal master for services rendered in the [[Netherlands]] &amp;mdash; from [[espionage]] to loans of money &amp;mdash; which he had small chance of collecting in cash.   His prospects of getting into the employ of the state were improved when, on January 18, 1682, he secured a certificate showing that he had discussed with a Hamburg [[Lutheran]] minister the relative merits of [[Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]], and thereby become convinced of the truth of the [[Augsburg Confession]], and partook of the [[Holy Communion]]. In depending upon the favor of princes, he had been forced, even before his appointment as Governor, to drink deep from the cup of misfortune.  However praiseworthy the King's selection of this 53-year-old [[Mercenary|soldier of fortune]] for service in the company might have been from motives of [[Compassion|humanity]], his choice could scarcely have been looked upon by hard-headed business men with anything but misgivings.

The ''Fortuna'' arrived at [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]] on October 13, 1684, after a voyage of about nine weeks.&lt;ref name="Krarup, Milan, 6"&gt;Krarup, Milan, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  At [[Nevis]] Milan called on October 6 to pay his respects to Governor Stapleton and to receive the latter's "instruction".  Sir William seems to have availed himself of the opportunity to accompany Milan and to witness Adolph Esmit's final disgrace. Esmit handed over the reins of office without delay or resistance. He also handed over a treasury so empty that when the English were ready to depart, after having been entertained for ten days, the money needed for the purchase of parting gifts for English dignitaries had to be borrowed by the government from a planter. What was worst of all, Esmit handed over to Milan an island that had become an outlaw among its more reputable neighbors. This was shown clearly enough two months before the latter's arrival, when, on May 22, a Spanish captain, Antonio Martino, landed and carried fifty-six slaves off to [[Hispaniola]] or [[Haiti]]. Lieutenant Heins had been sent over with two planters to demand the return of the loot, but without success.&lt;ref name="Krarup, Milan, 6"/&gt;

That Esmit had been prepared for the present contingency there could be no doubt. The gold, silver, and other property that he was able to scrape together had been sent to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] island of [[St. Eustatius]], whence they were to be shipped to [[Vlissingen|Flushing]]. Although Milan had been instructed only to secure the persons of Esmit and his family and to have them sent to Copenhagen, he took it upon himself to try to secure the latter's property as well, by sending Niels Lassen to [[Louis Houtcooper|Governor Houtcooper]] of St. Eustatius with an alleged copy of his instructions and a demand for the delivery of the goods. But neither this nor subsequent attempts availed the crafty governor. Instead of seeking redress through diplomatic channels, as his masters expected him to do, he authorized Captain Delicaet to take the company's ship ''Charlotte Amalie'' (named after [[Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel]] or Hesse-Cassel), find the skipper who had transported the goods and make his ship lawful prize.&lt;ref&gt;Personalhistorisk Tidskrift, 3 R. 2 B., 9. The skipper's name was Jochum Samuelsen.&lt;/ref&gt; It was to avoid just this sort of complication that Esmit had been displaced. But Milan was an exponent of direct action, he sought advice from none, and the council dared not oppose his will.

Instead of sending his deposed predecessor back to Copenhagen to answer for his stewardship over the company's affairs, and to act as defendant in a suit brought by his brother Nicholas, he clapped him into confinement, first keeping him at the fort as his guest, but later putting him in a prison cell.&lt;ref&gt;Esmit to Gyldensparre (September 23, 1686). A. E., 1682-89.&lt;/ref&gt; Madame Esmit had rightly decided that she could be more useful in Copenhagen than in St. Thomas and had started on her journey before Milan arrived. By this time, matters had grown rather beyond her power of control despite all her influential friends and her genius for intrigue, so she confined herself to taking measures to save what she could of the family property. She returned to St. Thomas in December to share the hardships of prison life with her husband.

The story of how Governor Milan, his sick body racked with fever almost from the first, restlessly suspicious and ofttimes with reason of his fellow men, jealous of his official power and position, administered the affairs of St. Thomas during his sixteen months' incumbency may be dealt with rather briefly. In Captain Meyer's attempt to provide the Fortuna,  with a good return cargo, the governor took but an indifferent interest, and as to the Esmits' returning on the Fortuna, he would have none of it. Just why he should deliberately keep with him persons who could not but be a source of trouble as long as they were near, is difficult to explain on other grounds than cupidity. Milan had been unable to lay his hands on Esmit's gains. In his relations with his council, he showed his arbitrariness and wilfulness. In place of Lieutenant Heins, who happened to be absent on the company's business when Milan arrived, the governor promptly appointed his son, Felix.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of selecting permanent councilors from among the planters as he had been instructed to do under certain specified conditions, he put in now one, now another, until fourteen planters had taken part in the government with him.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the other planters Milan was equally whimsical. For trifling misdemeanors, he instituted elaborate investigations and meted out extravagant fines and punishments where a wiser man would have overlooked the whole matter.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 12, 23, 26, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Offending negroes were made to feel the pressure of the governor's heavy hand. A runaway who might have been mercifully beheaded was impaled alive on a sharpened stick to die in horrible agony.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 22, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Another negro, arrested on a similar charge, had his foot cut off, after which he was confiscated to the governor's use and put to work in his kitchen.

When in the spring following the departure of the Fortuna (on March 31, 1685), Milan got wind of what he at once suspected to be a nefarious plot against his life, he vented his fury upon the unfortunate persons with swift and fiendish vengeance.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of charges and counter-charges, one fact stood out with a clearness that was unmistakable. Milan's stewardship of his own plantation property was above reproach; seventy negroes remained on the plantation even after twenty-five had been returned to an Englishman from whom they had been forcibly seized.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Here prosperity was rife.

In Copenhagen, Captain Meyer's arrival was naturally awaited with a good deal of interest, even anxiety.  The captain's report when he arrived on June 10, 1685, without Adolph Esmit, and even without a word from Milan, gave the directors and shareholders food for thought. Although they had only the captain's unsupported word, the small cargo and Milan's silence could not but rouse their fears that something was seriously wrong at St. Thomas. A meeting of the Company's shareholders was held within two days, and it was decided that the situation was serious enough to justify sending a memorial to the king asking once more for the loan of the Fortuna,  and for the sending thence of a commissioner with power to settle all the difficulties. They suggested an attorney or fiscal in the navy department, [[Mikkel Mikkelsen]].&lt;ref&gt;Mariager MS., 49, 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The king could do nothing but fall in with the company's recommendations.

Commissioner Mikkelsen, armed with full power, left Copenhagen on the Fortuna October 15, 1685, touched at Nevis on February 19 to get the latest St. Thomas advices, and arrived at his destination on February 24, 1686. The governor's son, Ferdinand, had already sent his father a warning from Copenhagen that it was planned to send out a new governor, namely, Captain Meyer, whom the governor had blamed for most of his misfortunes, even his illness. Milan, whose nerves had scarcely recovered from the shock of the "conspiracy," called the planters together in the "German" &lt;!--Dutch Reformed?--&gt; church. There he informed them of this last "conspiracy," namely, the attempt to place this "rascal" Mikkelsen in the governor's seat "whom he ought to be hanged to the highest tree.".&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; He counselled resistance, exhorted their aid, and by cajolings and threats secured their signatures to a document by which they pledged themselves to leave the land before they would see their governor leave them.

But if he proposed to give battle, he needed to secure the sinews of war. He chose a method consistent with his nature. On February 17, 1686, just as the royal commissioner was approaching the West Indian Waters, the governor authorized Captain Daniel Moy to take the company's ship, Charlotte Amalia, and  cruise upon the Spaniards wherever they might be of thirty men; Captain Moy put to sea to make war upon the kingdom of Spain. The Charlotte Amalia had no difficulty in finding a Spanish ship on the Porto Rico coast, but the latter vessel had the temerity to answer Captain Moy's fire, wounding one man, killing another, and forcing the valiant captain to beat a nasty retreat to St. Thomas. It was withal an inglorious ending to a sorry enterprise, and not calculated to redeem the good name of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commissioners had arrived in the harbor before the news of the "reprisal" fiasco could reach the governor, and before his "valet," Moses Caille, could return from the French islands, whence he had been sent by the desperate governor in search of help.&lt;ref&gt;Caille's mission appears to have borne no fruit beyond arousing the Spaniards.&lt;/ref&gt; Sitting in his private room and surrounded by all manner of firearms, the governor drew the parley out for three days before he finally surrendered to the king's representative. Mikkelsen's intimation that Milan's attitude rendered him liable to the charge of rebellion, combined with the fact that the men on whom he could depend  were rapidly diminishing in number, brought the governor to his knees. A guard consisting of twelve men from the Fortuna and twelve planters, all under the command of Christopher Heins, was placed at the fort. With his removal to the ship, the reign of Gabriel Milan came to a sudden end. Adolph Esmit and his wife, Charity, likewise the company's merchant, Niels Lassen, who had been in prison since April 30, were taken out of their dungeons and put on board ship. The scene of interest, as far as the company is concerned, was soon to shift to Copenhagen. Nicholas Esmit had already lost his wits while in a Copenhagen prison waiting for a chance to clear himself and to bring action against his brother. The two successors of Nicholas were now to be given a chance to defend their official actions in the Danish courts and before the directors of the company.

Commissioner Mikkelsen was employed from March until July with collecting evidence from the planters concerning Milan's conduct. A few extracts  from a letter written by the official reporter, Andrew Brock, to director Albert Gyldensparre on June 30, 1686, just before the Fortuna sailed, will give an idea of the proceedings. "I wish for my part that your Excellency could have been here a single day and heard what thundering there has been in the commission, with howling, shouting, and screaming, one against the other, and I had to write it into the protocol just as fast [as they spoke] . . . but God be thanked it is over, and former Lieutenant Christopher Heins was yesterday made governor and vice commandant here. May God in heaven aid him to carry on his government better than his predecessors, which I expect him to do, as he has shown himself only as an honest and upright man. . . . "&lt;ref&gt;B. &amp; D., 1683-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Milan himself dictated a letter to the directors in justification of his conduct in which he vented his wrath on those inhabitants and employees who had attested to his zeal and faithfulness, but were now shouting, "Crucify him, crucify him!" The letters of the two prisoners, Esmit and Lassen, which were sent over at the same time, bore out on the whole the testimony of the planters, whose sympathies were on the side of those two victims of Milan's wrath.&lt;ref&gt;Esmit to Directors; Lassen to same (March 13, 1686). A. E., 1682-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Trial and death ==
Mikkelsen left St. Thomas with his rather uncongenial company on July 5, and did not arrive in Copenhagen until October 12, 1686. Besides the two governors with their families and negro servants, the list of passengers included Niels Lassen, Gerhart Philipsen, and John Lorentz, whose testimony was desired in the suits. A commission was appointed within a week to try the case against Milan, but delays in getting the tangled evidence straightened prevented a decision being reached before November 17, 1687. An appeal to the Supreme Court brought further delays, but finally the case was opened on February 14, 1689. The judges rendered their individual opinions on March 14, and judgment was finally pronounced on March 21. The sentence was not a surprise to those who had followed the case. After a fair, impartial trial Gabriel Milan was found guilty and condemned to lose his property, honor, and life, and his head and hand were to be put upon a stake.&lt;ref&gt;Krarup, Milan, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; A royal pardon saved him from the last grim disgrace,&lt;ref&gt;Queen Charlotte Amalia had earlier befriended Madame Milan, and was one of the "chief participants" in the company. She had helped to mitigate Commissioner Mikkelsen's instructions, and may have used her good offices here,&lt;/ref&gt; and at dawn on March 26, 1689, he was beheaded on [[Nytorv]] Square in Copenhagen.

== Succession ==
Adolph Esmit's long imprisonment both on St. Thomas and in Copenhagen in 1686 and 1687 had given him grounds for appearing as the injured party, and for demanding some form of restitution. While the Milan trial was dragging slowly on, the former governor and his wife seemed  to have been kept in prison in Copenhagen. From their arrival on October 12, 1686, until March, 1687, when Nicholas' case against his brother was finally ready for trial, they remained in confinement.&lt;ref&gt;Adolph's "brothers-in-law", Steen Andersen Bille and Jürgen Jürgensen, gave bonds for his appearance. A. E., 1682&amp;ndash;89 (March 25, 1687).&lt;/ref&gt; Here, as in the case of Milan, a commission was appointed,&lt;ref&gt;Jens Juel, Mathias Moth, Muhle and Höyer.&lt;/ref&gt; and although a number of petty irregularities and cases of tampering with accounts were found, Adolph Esmit was on November 2, 1687, given a verdict of not guilty.

On the same day, the directors of the company named him governor of St. Thomas,&lt;ref&gt;One condition was that he should invest 2,000 rdl. within one year after he took possession at St. Thomas.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later a fleet of three ships, the ''Young Tobias'', ''the Red Cock'' (''Den Røde Hane'') and the ''Maria'' left Copenhagen for the West Indies. Accompanying Adolph Esmit, and in command of the fleet, was vice-admiral Iver Hoppe who seems to have had secret orders to being Esmit back with him to Denmark in case he proved intractable.

In 1689, the governor and council proposed that a sugar mill should be put up on Milan's former plantation, and ventured the opinion that if sugar cane should prove successful on the Company's plantations, it would prove more profitable than cotton or tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;Resolutions of governor and council (February 19, 1689). The members of the council were Henry Irgens, Joachim Delicaet, John de Windt, and John Lorentz.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JA Chisholm.jpg|thumb|Photograph of John Alexander Chisholm]]

'''John Alexander Chisholm''' (1859-1903) was a Canadian inventor and businessman who developed the Chisholm-Scott Pea Viner, an agricultural machine for shelling peas, and sold these machines throughout [[Canada]] and the [[United States]] through the Chisholm-Scott Company.

==Early life==

John Alexander was born in [[Oakville, Ontario]] to John Alexander Chisholm, Sr. and Sarah Petit Bigger. He was descended from [[William Chisholm (Upper Canada politician)]], the founder of Oakville. John's father owned the 'Oakville Basket Factory', which exposed him to industrial machinery from a young age, giving him the opportunity to develop skills in mechanical engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John A. Chisholm|url=http://images.halinet.on.ca/2/Exhibit/9|website=Halton Images|accessdate=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Chisholm-Scott Company==

John and his brother Charlie invented the first pea harvesting machine that could shell peas through impact. In 1890 their invention passed field tests in [[New York state]] and they brothers soon formed a partnership with Robert P. Scott as the Chisholm-Scott Company. These pea viners had a series of paddles which struck the pea pods, compressing the air inside which split the pods open and released the peas onto a conveyor belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lockyer|first1=Peter|title=An Uncertain Harvest: Hard Work, Big Business and Changing Times in Prince Edward County, Ontario|journal=Material Culture Review|date=Spring 1991|volume=33|url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/MCR/rt/printerFriendly/17468/22525}}&lt;/ref&gt; These machines could remove as many peas from pods as 600 workers could do by hand, vastly improving the efficiency of this branch of agriculture.&lt;ref name="Klein2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Maury Klein|title=The Genesis of Industrial America, 1870–1920|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rFVevRS86CkC&amp;pg=PA28|date=3 September 2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-46598-4|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pea-viners were sold both in Canada and the United States and the company found a large market for their product. The Chisholm-Scott Company had a factory and office in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]] in addition to offices in [[Baltimore]] and Suspension Bridge, New York. On June 27, 1893 an improved pea-huller machine was created by the company.

The Chisholm-Scott Pea Viner was praised by the [[Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture]] for its efficiency and ability to greatly simplify the task of shelling peas. A report on the state's canning industry by George C. Butz wrote that "The pea canning business has been greatly modified in recent years by the invention of some remarkable machinery, particularly the Chisholm-Scott Pea Viner. Formerly a great army of pickers was necessary in pea canning section to pick the peas from the vines in the fields. Another army of hands was necessary to hull the green peas and so throughout the whole series of operations of canning peas the labour was excessive, tedious and expensive. Now the vines are cut with the scythe or mower, hauled to the factory and delivered to the viner or huller which shells and separates the peas from the vines, discharging the latter to one side and the former to the cleaner. The patentees and manufacturers of this viner are the Chisholm-Scott Co., Suspension Bridge, N.Y. They do not sell the machine, but place them with canners among a royalty basis in restricted territories."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butz|first1=George C.|title=Canning of Fruits and Vegetables|date=1902|publisher=State Printer of Pennsylvania|page=37|url=https://archive.org/details/canningoffruitsv00butz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was also involved in selling canned peas and other agricultural machinery. For example, they developed an apparatus for spreading air exhaust to eliminate [[pea aphids]] during an epidemic of the insects in [[Maryland]].

==Personal life==

John married Emelda Beeler of [[Topeka, Kansas]] in 1896. They were married in Topeka with John's business partner Robert Scott acting as the best man. The couple had two daughters, Hazel Elizabeth Chisholm (1897-1978) and Grace Juliet Chisholm (1902-1964). John and Emelda lived in Oakville briefly, but Emelda felt uncomfortable due to the town's coolness toward Americans, especially from John's mother Sarah who was descended from [[United Empire Loyalists]] and did not approve of her son's marriage. John and Sarah moved to [[Rochester, New York]] and later to Washington D.C., although they kept a summer home in Oakville named 'Mt. Vernon'.

John Chisholm died of [[typhoid fever]] in his home at [[Washington D.C.]] in 1903. The Chisholm-Scott Company continued after his death under the management of Robert Scott.

He was interned at [[Karlsruhe]], [[Krefeld]], [[Ströhen]] and later at [[Holzminden prisoner-of-war camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Famous Escape of the 29.|newspaper=Otago Daily Times|date=23 November 1918|page=8 |url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/OAM19181207.2.58 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 July 1918, he and 28 other officers escaped from the Holzminden camp through a tunnel which had taken 10 months to dig. He made his way to the Dutch frontier in the clothes of a prisoner of war and then returned to England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Straits Times|date=29 May 1938|page=12|title=Hong Kong A.P.C.

The '''Markets in Financial Instruments Directive''' 2004/39/EC (known colloquially as "'''MiFID'''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:02004L0039-20060428:EN:NOT|title=Directive 2004/39/EC|publisher=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|year=2004|accessdate=20 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;) as subsequently amended&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:076:0033:0036:EN:PDF|title=Directive 2008/10/EC|publisher=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|year=2008|accessdate=20 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[European Union law]] that provides harmonised regulation for investment services across the 31 member states of the [[European Economic Area]] (the 28 EU [[EU member states|member states]] plus Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein). The directive's main objectives are to increase competition and [[investor protection]] in investment services. As of the effective date, 1 November 2007, it replaced the Investment Services Directive (ISD).&lt;ref&gt;Directive 93/22/EEC&lt;/ref&gt;

MiFID is the cornerstone of the European Commission's [[Financial Services Action Plan]], whose 42 measures will significantly change how EU financial service markets operate. MiFID is the most significant piece of legislation introduced under the [[Lamfalussy process|Lamfalussy procedure]] designed to accelerate the adopting of legislation based on a [[four-level approach]] recommended by the [[Committee of Wise Men on the Regulation of European Securities Markets|Committee of Wise Men]] chaired by Baron [[Alexandre Lamfalussy]]. There are three other "Lamfalussy Directives"—the Prospectus Directive, the Market Abuse Directive and the Transparency Directive.

MiFID retained the principles of the EU "passport" introduced by the [[Investment Services Directive]] (ISD) but introduced the concept of "maximum harmonization" which places more emphasis on home state supervision. This is a change from the prior EU financial service legislation which featured a "minimum harmonization and mutual recognition" concept. "Maximum harmonization" does not permit states to be "super equivalent" or to "[[Gold-plating (European Union law)|gold-plate]]" EU requirements detrimental to a "level playing field". Another change was the abolition of the "concentration rule" in which member states could require investment firms to route client orders through regulated markets.&lt;ref&gt;This option was not taken up by all EU states.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://mifiddatabase.cesr.eu/ CESR MiFID databases] for a list of regulated markets, multilateral trading facilities, systematic internalisers and shares.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MiFID Level 1 Directive 2004/39/EC, implemented through the standard [[co-decision procedure]] of the [[Council of the European Union]], and the [[European Parliament]], sets out a detailed framework for the legislation. Twenty articles of this directive specified technical implementation measures (Level 2). These measures were adopted by the [[European Commission]], based on technical advice from the [[Committee of European Securities Regulators]] and negotiations in the [[European Securities Committee]] with oversight by the [[European Parliament]]. Implementation measures in the form of a Commission Directive and Commission Regulation were officially published on 2 September 2006.&lt;ref name="directive"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_241/l_24120060902en00260058.pdf|title=COMMISSION DIRECTIVE 2006/73/EC|publisher=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|year=2006|accessdate=22 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="comreg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_241/l_24120060902en00010025.pdf|title=COMMISSION REGULATION (EC) No 1287/2006|publisher=[[Official Journal of the European Union]]|year=2006|accessdate=22 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Under European law, a Directive has to be transposed into national law: a Regulation, on the other hand, is automatically binding throughout all member states.&lt;/ref&gt;

After its initial implementation, MiFID was intended to be reviewed.  After extensive discussion and debate, in April 2014, the European Parliament approved both MiFID II, an updated version of the original MiFID law, and MiFID II's accompanying regulation, MiFIR.&lt;ref name=Holley14&gt;{{cite news |title=European Parliament passes "sensible" MiFID II |author=Elliott Holley |url=http://www.bankingtech.com/217362/european-parliament-passes-sensible-mifid-ii/ |work=Banking Technology |date=16 April 2014 |accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The directive and regulation include fewer exemptions and expand the scope of the original MiFID to cover a larger group of companies and financial products.&lt;ref name="Smith14"&gt;{{cite news |title=ESMA unveils final guidance on MiFID II rules |author=Hannah Smith |url=http://www.investmentweek.co.uk/investment-week/news/2387771/esma-unveils-final-guidance-for-mifid-ii-rules |work=Investment Week |date=19 December 2014 |accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Changing14&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/markets/international-markets/mifid-ii/what-is-changing |title=MiFID II – what is changing? |date=9 December 2014 |publisher=Financial Conduct Authority |accessdate=27 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203100127/http://www.fca.org.uk/firms/markets/international-markets/mifid-ii/what-is-changing |archivedate=3 February 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both MiFID II and MiFIR are effective from 3 January 2018.

==Background and history==
MiFID was intended to replace the Investment Services Directive, which was adopted in 1993.&lt;ref name=Legislationforce&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/finance/securities/isd/mifid/index_en.htm |title=Legislation in force: MiFID I |date=18 February 2015 |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law creates a single market for investment services and activities, which improves the competitiveness in EU markets.&lt;ref name=Legislationforce/&gt; While the original law did succeed in lowering prices and expanding choices for investors, weaknesses in MiFID's structure became apparent during the financial crisis in 2008.&lt;ref name=EC2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/docs/isd/mifid/COM_2011_656_en.pdf|title=Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments repealing Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council|date=20 October 2011 |work=European Commission |format=PDF |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MiFID was also intended to make changes to share-trading, and it set guidelines for the use of related financial instruments.&lt;ref name=Legislationforce/&gt; The law was introduced in order to reduce [[systemic risk]] and strengthen existing investor protections.&lt;ref name=Hume15&gt;{{cite news |title=Trafigura says European trading rules have ‘little justification’ |author=Neil Hume |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f7a67662-cf1e-11e4-9949-00144feab7de.html |work=Financial Times |date=22 March 2015 |accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the approval process for MiFID, a proposal from the European Commission was read by European Parliament in March 2004.&lt;ref name=Hemetsberger08&gt;{{cite book |title=European Banking and Financial Services Law |author=Walburga Hemetsberger |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher=European Association of Public Banks |location= |isbn= |page=67 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2tx8ZX7S7PgC&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;ots=sQ32WlpNWg&amp;dq=european%20parliament%20reading%20MiFID%20march%202004&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q=european%20parliament%20reading%20MiFID%20march%202004&amp;f=false |accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ECflowchart&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/codecision/stepbystep/diagram_en.htm |title=Codecision Flowchart |date=21 August 2012 |publisher=The European Commission |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006, the Commission published consultation responses it received in 2005. In June 2006, the Commission published a new draft of MiFID.&lt;ref name=MIFIDIimp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/finance/securities/isd/archives_en.htm |title=MiFID – Archives |date=18 February 2015 |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EC and Parliament discussed any suggested amendments to approve Level One texts.&lt;ref name=ESMApaper14&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esma.europa.eu/content/Consultation-Paper-MiFID-IIMiFIR|title=Consultation Paper on MiFID II/MiFIR|publisher=ESMA|accessdate=16 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408232204/http://www.esma.europa.eu/content/Consultation-Paper-MiFID-IIMiFIR|archivedate=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second reading of the legislature by both Parliament and the Commission followed.&lt;ref name=ECflowchart/&gt;

MiFID was introduced under the [[Lamfalussy process|Lamfalussy procedure]], which was designed to accelerate the adoption of legislation based on a [[four-level approach]] recommended by the [[Committee of Wise Men on the Regulation of European Securities Markets|Committee of Wise Men]]. The Committee was chaired by Baron [[Alexandre Lamfalussy]]. There are three other "Lamfalussy Directives," including the Prospectus Directive, the Market Abuse Directive and the Transparency Directive.&lt;ref name=Skinner07&gt;{{cite book |title=The Future of Investing in Europe's Markets after MiFID |author=Chris Skinner |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GZv3z9Y5CI4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Level 1===
The MiFID Level 1 Directive 2004/39/EC, implemented through the standard [[co-decision procedure]] of the [[Council of the European Union]], and the [[European Parliament]], sets out a detailed framework for the legislation.&lt;ref name="directive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="comreg"/&gt; It also amends Council Directives 85/611/EEC and 93/6/EEC and Directive 2000/12/EC and repeals Council Directive 93/22/EEC, Investment Services Directive (ISD) originally adopted in 1993.&lt;ref name=L1D04&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1398325978410&amp;uri=CELEX:02004L0039-20110104 |title=MiFID Level 1 Directive 2004/39/EC |date=21 April 2004 |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Level 2===
Twenty articles of this directive specified technical implementation measures (Level 2). These measures were adopted by the [[European Commission]], based on technical advice from the [[Committee of European Securities Regulators]] and negotiations in the [[European Securities Committee]] with oversight by the [[European Parliament]]. Implementation measures in the form of a Commission Directive and Commission Regulation were officially published on 2 September 2006.&lt;ref name="directive"/&gt;&lt;ref name="comreg"/&gt;

==Contents==
===Scope===
To determine which firms are affected by MiFID and which are not, MiFID distinguishes between "investment services and activities" ("core" services) and "ancillary services" ("non-core" services). More detail on the services in each category can be found in Annex 1 Sections A and B of the MiFID Level 1 Directive.

If a firm performs investment services and activities, it is subject to MiFID in respect both of these and also of ancillary services (and it can use the MiFID passport to provide them to member states other than its home state). However, if a firm only performs ancillary services, it is not subject to MiFID (but nor can it benefit from the MiFID passport).

MiFID covers almost all tradable financial products with the exception of certain foreign exchange trades. This includes commodity and other derivatives such as [[Shipping markets#freight derivatives|freight]], [[Weather derivative|climate]] and [[Energy derivative|carbon derivatives]], which were not covered by ISD.

That part of a firm's business that is not covered by the above is not subject to MiFID.

Celent, a financial services consultancy, estimated in 2007 that under MiFID, the three largest EU jurisdictions—France, (Germany), and the UK—would require publication of over 100 million additional trades annually, with spending increasing as well but at a slower rate, from €38&amp;nbsp;million yearly to close to €50&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reports.celent.com/PressReleases/20070123/MiFIDPostTrade.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610221727/http://reports.celent.com/PressReleases/20070123/MiFIDPostTrade.asp |date=10 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substance===
;Authorisation, regulation and passporting: Firms covered by MiFID will be authorised and regulated in their "home state" (broadly, the country in which they have their registered office). Once a firm has been authorised, it will be able to use the MiFID passport to provide services to customers in other EU member states. These services will be regulated by the member state in their "home state" (whereas currently under ISD, a service is regulated by the member state in which the service takes place).

;Client categorisation: MiFID requires firms to categorise clients as "eligible counterparties", professional clients or retail clients (these have increasing levels of protection). Clear procedures must be in place to categorise clients and assess their suitability for each type of investment product. That said, the appropriateness of any investment advice or suggested financial transaction must still be verified before being given.

;Client order handling: MiFID has requirements relating to the information that needs to be captured when accepting client orders, ensuring that a firm is acting in a client's best interests and as to how orders from different clients may be aggregated.

;Pre-trade transparency: MiFID will require that operators of continuous order-matching systems must make aggregated order information on "liquid shares" available at the five best price levels on the buy and sell side; for quote-driven markets, the best bids and offers of market makers must be made available. (Note consideration is being given to extending these requirements to other financial instruments. Under Article 65(1) of Directive 2004/39/EC, the European Commission is due to submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on extending pre- and post-trade transparency requirements to transactions in financial instruments other than shares by October 2007.)

;Post-trade transparency: MiFID will require firms to publish the price, volume and time of all trades in listed shares, even if executed outside of a regulated market, unless certain requirements are met to allow for deferred publication. (Note see comment above regarding extension of these requirements to other financial instruments).

;Inducements and investment research: One of the most controversial aspects of MiFID II is that it severely restricts asset managers' ability to obtain investment research with client commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars, MiFID II and Other Trading Activities,'' §§11:4 – 11:7 (Thomson West, 2017–2018 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

;Best execution: MiFID II will require that firms take all sufficient steps to obtain the best possible result in the execution of an order for a client. The [[Best execution|best possible result]] is not limited to execution price but also includes cost, speed, likelihood of execution and likelihood of settlement and any other factors deemed relevant.  MiFID II's "all sufficient steps" test sets a somewhat higher standard than the previous "all reasonable steps" standard in MiFID.&lt;ref&gt;Lemke and Lins, ''Soft Dollars, MiFID II and Other Trading Activities,'' §11:8 (Thomson West, 2017–2018 ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

;Systematic Internaliser: A Systematic Internaliser is a firm that executes orders from its clients against its own book or against orders from other clients. MiFID will treat Systematic Internalisers as mini-exchanges, hence, for example, they will be subject to pre-trade and post-trade transparency requirements (see above).

==Market fragmentation==
Although MiFID was intended to increase transparency for prices, the fragmentation of [[trading venue]]s has had an unanticipated effect. Where once a financial institution was able to see information from just one or two exchanges, they now have the possibility (and in some cases the obligation) to collect information from a multitude of [[Multilateral trading facility|multilateral trading facilities]], Systematic Internalisers and other exchanges from around the [[European Economic Area]] (EEA). This results in an additional amount of work to benefit from the transparency that MiFID has introduced.

The number of additional pricing sources introduced by MiFID means that financial institutions have had to seek additional data sources to ensure that they capture as many quotes/trades as possible. Numerous [[financial data vendors]] have worked with the MiFID Joint Working Group and Regulators to make sure that they are able to help financial institutions to deal with the fragmentation and benefit from the increased transparency, while helping them to fulfill their new reporting liabilities.

==Transposition==

MiFID and its accompanying implementing directive were [[Transposition (law)|transposed]] in full and on time, with minor exceptions. The European Commission has published a transposition table linking to lists of national provisions which transpose directives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/isd/mifid_implementation_en.htm MiFID Transposition state of play] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008172000/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/isd/mifid_implementation_en.htm |date=8 October 2011 }} European Commission&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
The [[Financial Services Authority]] (FSA), now the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA), was the body responsible for regulation of the securities industry in the United Kingdom during the period of implementation. It incorporated MiFID into its Handbook of rules and guidance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsa.gov.uk/about/what/international/mifid Review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II)] Government of the United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
The French government has implemented MiFID by modifying the French Monetary and Financial Code, in particular by ordinance number 2007-544 of 12 April 2007, and the decrees 2007-901 and 2007-904 of 15 May 2007. The Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) has also applied MiFID to its General Regulations (''Règlement Général'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amf-france.org/documents/general/7839_1.pdf MiFID implementation in France]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} AMF-France.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==MiFID II/MiFIR==
In April 2010 [[Committee of European Securities Regulators|CESR]] issued consultation papers on MiFID review.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesr.eu/index.php?page=consultation&amp;mac=0&amp;id= |title=NetNames : Noms de domaine |publisher=Cesr.eu |accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consultation period was short and ended on 31 May 2010. There was one day of open hearings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cesr.eu/index.php?page=hearings&amp;mac=0&amp;id= |title=NetNames : Noms de domaine |publisher=Cesr.eu |accessdate=12 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris on 17 May 2010. Public responses to the consultations are now available&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; although a number of institutions also submitted confidential responses.

On 8 December 2010, following a public hearing held in September 2010, the European Commission released a substantial public consultation relating to the review of MiFID (MiFID II), accompanied by a press release and frequently asked questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/isd/mifid_en.htm Investment Services Directive – Markets in Financial Instruments Directive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321191440/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/isd/mifid_en.htm |date=21 March 2011 }} 20 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The public consultation period was scheduled to close on 2 February 2011. On 26 May 2011, the Commission was reported to be working to present its proposals before the end of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/47044528-8797-11e0-af98-00144feabdc0.html Quick View: Are Emir and MiFID now delayed?] 26 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 October 2011, the European Commission adopted formal proposals for a "Directive on markets in financial instruments repealing Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council" (MiFID II Directive), and for a "Regulation on markets in financial instruments (MiFIR)", which would also amend the proposed [[European Market Infrastructure Regulation]] (EMIR) on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and [[Trade Repository|trade repositories]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/isd/mifid_en.htm FT: Mifid amendment calls for commission ban to be scrapped] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321191440/http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/securities/isd/mifid_en.htm |date=21 March 2011 }} 29 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, MEP [[Markus Ferber]] suggested amendments to the European Commission's proposals, intended to strengthen restrictions on [[high-frequency trading]] and commodity price manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Both MiFID II and MiFIR entered into force on 2 July 2014.  The initial date for implementation by the Member States was 3 January 2017, however, in February 2016 the European Commission delayed this until 3 January 2018 to allow for the building of IT systems to enable enforcement of the new package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Some banks and institutions advocated for a further delay to the implementations of MiFID II, with smaller organisations not yet equipped for the additional demands.&lt;ref name="FTmifidII"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stafford|first1=Philip|last2=Noonan|first2=Laura|last3=Murphy|first3=Hannah|title=Banks lobby for reprieve on key part of Mifid II rules|url=https://www.ft.com/content/89cb1f24-e011-11e7-a8a4-0a1e63a52f9c|accessdate=19 December 2017|work=Financial Times|publisher=Nikkei Company|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, MiFID II came into force on the revised date of 3 January 2018.

Some analysts believe the impact of MiFID II will lead to global investment research expenditures falling by as much as $1.5bn annually when the rules come into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pearlman|first1=Elisabeth|title=Banks want to delay a key part of the Mifid II legislation ahead of next month's deadline|url=https://www.verdict.co.uk/banks-mifid-ii-legislation-lei/|accessdate=19 December 2017|work=Verdict UK|publisher=GlobalData PLC|date=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days of coming into effect, [[Intercontinental Exchange]] announced plans to transfer trading in 245 energy futures contracts from London to the US, putting transactions under the oversight of US, rather than European, regulators&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/999ab1c4-f648-11e7-88f7-5465a6ce1a00|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|access-date=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

He was killed by a mortar round just two days before the [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|fall of Sirte]] and death of former Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]].&lt;ref name="modernghana"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.modernghana.com/news/357000/1/commander-bufa-lost-in-sirte-battle.html|title=Commander 'Bufa' lost in Sirte battle|work=Modern Ghana|agency=Agence France-Presse|first=Herve|last=Bar|date=21 October 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011|location=Benghazi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Bin Dardef was a businessman in the Mediterranean city of Benghazi before he joined the uprising, importing medical equipment and children's toys, and was twice jailed under the Gaddafi regime for his alleged Islamist leanings. He commanded the Fakhri Alsalabi unit, named after a pilot killed in mid-March, and fought in the [[Second Battle of Benghazi|second battle of Benghazi]].&lt;ref name="modernghana" /&gt; He left behind a son and four daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/24501/World/Region/Street-fighting-rocks-Sirte-as-Clinton-visits-Trip.aspx|title=Street fighting rocks Sirte as Clinton visits Tripoli|work=Ahram Online|date=18 October 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011|agency=Agence France-Presse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was active in the [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|battle of Sirte]], being the commander who announced the capture of Sirte's port on 26 September&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iukTaF46Mnp4rXQDDrno9_qLyIFg|title=Anti-Kadhafi fighters capture hometown port|work=Google News|agency=Agence France-Presse|last=Deshmukh|first=Jay|date=26 September 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011|location=Sirte}}&lt;/ref&gt; and speaking to news crews discussing the latest advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/22046/World/Region/Advance-on-Gaddafi-hometown-delayed-for-want-of-am.aspx|agency=Agence France-Presse|work=Ahram Online|title=Advance on Gaddafi hometown delayed for want of ammunition|date=22 September 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also announced the reports that Moussa Ibrahim had been captured in September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=314547|title=Hunt on for Gadaffi's son as key aide held|work=The Gulf Daily News|location=Sirte|date=30 September 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this would later prove untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/312204|title=NTC commander admits did not capture Moussa Ibrahim|first=Katerina|last=Nikolas|work=Digital Journal|date=1 October 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibrahim was again reported captured when Sirte fell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/energyOilNews/idAFL5E7LK3CW20111020|agency=Reuters|title=Gaddafi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim captured --NTC|date=20 October 2011|accessdate=24 October 2011|first=Jon|last=Hemming|location=Sirte|work=Reuters Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this was again proven to be untrue. On 22 October 2011, he was again reportedly captured for a third time, along with [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], near [[Bani Walid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/313227 Libya's NTC claim Saif al-Islam Gaddafi captured alive, uninjured]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Bin Dardef died when a mortar round slammed into a vehicle packed with ammunition. A piece of metal tore into his bullet-proof vest while another ripped his throat, killing him almost instantly. He was buried in Benghazi's Martyrs' Cemetery, along with other fighters who had died in Sirte.&lt;ref name="modernghana" /&gt;

He had served as legal adviser of Hong Kong laws of the Foreign Economics Trade Committee of the People's Government of [[Chongqing City]].&lt;ref name="bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/people/person.asp?personId=22827697&amp;privcapId=144398559|title=Wing Ka Ng|work=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2014 Hong Kong electoral reform]] of the electoral method for the Chief Executive, Ng represented the CMAHK to submit a report of the [[Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau]], suggesting the four-subsector structure of the nominating committee, which the first subsector represented the business interest, should be maintained. He also said that the "civil nomination" proposal as suggested by some [[pan-democrats]] was not incompatible with the [[Hong Kong Basic Law|Basic Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=吳永嘉：提委會無偏幫工商界 四大界別只佔其一 「公提」違提委會定義|url=http://designdemocracy.hk/%E5%90%B3%E6%B0%B8%E5%98%89%EF%BC%9A%E6%8F%90%E5%A7%94%E6%9C%83%E7%84%A1%E5%81%8F%E5%B9%AB%E5%B7%A5%E5%95%86%E7%95%8C-%E5%9B%9B%E5%A4%A7%E7%95%8C%E5%88%A5%E5%8F%AA%E4%BD%94%E5%85%B6%E4%B8%80-%E3%80%8C/?lang=tw|work=Design Democracy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oleksandr Yaroslavsky''' ({{lang-uk|Олександр Ярославський}}; born December 5, 1959) is a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] businessman. He was formerly co-owner of [[UkrSibbank]] and President of [[FC Metalist Kharkiv]] (2005-2012). He is currently President of Development Construction Holding (DCH)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DCH Key Person|url=http://www.dch.com.ua/en/about/head/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to Ukrainian and East European mass-media, is one of the most influential people in Ukraine. In 2016, he was ranked by Forbes as the tenth richest person in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaroslavsky Attracts International Investors, According to the Head of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine Borys Lozhkin|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/07/08/bc-yaroslavsky-idUKnPnbgJCfc+8c+PRN20150708}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Yaroslavsky was born in Zhdanov (now [[Mariupol]]), southeastern Ukraine. Both of his parents were doctors, and the family moved to Kharkiv while he was still a child. He graduated as a technologist from the Kharkiv Academy of Public Nutrition and then spent three years in the Soviet Army, for most of which time he served in Hungary. Upon being demobilized, Yaroslavsky spent one year studying jurisprudence provided by the Soviet [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Soviet Union)|MVD]] courses and serving as an inspector in the Kharkiv regional department against misappropriation of Socialist Property (so called [[OBKhSS]]), and in 1989 he graduated from the Odessa Institute of Technology as a Candidate of Technical Sciences. He subsequently worked at the Kharkiv Institute of Food before deciding to become an entrepreneur upon the collapse of the Soviet Union.

== Business Activities ==
Yaroslavsky was Vice-President of Gaia until 1996 and then became Vice-President of the Ukrainian representative office of Triverton International until 1997. From 1998 he was the President and major shareholder of JSCIB UkrSibbank (UKRSIB Group). He transferred control of UkrSibbank to BNP Paribas in 2006 and in the following year he devolved UKRSIB Group and consolidated it and his other operations under a single entity, DCH Group, of which he is the sole owner. In 2010, BNP Paribas took full ownership of UkrSibbank, retaining the services of DCH for debt recovery and other operational assistance.
DCH is one of the most powerful conglomerates in Ukraine and includes holdings in finance, industry, quarrying and cement, mining (Ukrainian Mining Co.) and real estate development (including the Vozdvyzhenka Elite Housing Estate in Kiev). One of Yaroslavsky’s principal interests is protecting the investments of his foreign partners which, as well as BNP Paribas, include Citigroup (USA) and Apollo (USA). Both of these companies share ownership, with DCH, of the Karavan Shopping Malls Network.
In partnership with the government, DCH rebuilt Kharkiv International Airport. The state financed the reconstruction of the airfield, and Yaroslavsky constructed a completely new terminal as well as renovated the old airport building to become Ukraine’s first private terminal. This work constituted the first airport development that had been carried out in Ukraine for 25 years and was officially opened on August 28, 2010.
On February 25, 2011, DCH completed the sale of Merefa Glass Ltd to the Turkish company Sisecam in a deal amounting to EUR 32 million, and in
early March 2011, DCH sold OJSC Azot to Dmytro Firtash. The sum remains undisclosed, but at the time Yaroslavsky said that he was "satisfied". According to experts, it was $800 million.
Yaroslavsky also constructed the first 5* hotel in Kharkiv, the Kharkiv Palace, which opened on December 5, 2011. During [[Euro 2012]] it was the HQ for [[UEFA]]. 
Yaroslavsky regularly attends Davos and, along with [[Viktor Pinchuk]], co-hosted the Ukrainian Lunch in 2011. He also assisted with organizing the Ukrainian delegation at the annual Yalta European Strategy (YES) Conference in 2011 and 2013.

== FC Metalist ==
Yaroslavsky became the owner of FC Metalist in 2006 and during his reign the club established a national record by winning the bronze medal in the national championship for six consecutive years. During this period, FC Metalist also reached the semi-final of the Ukrainian Domestic Cup on two occasions and consistently participated in the [[UEFA Cup]], reaching the quarter-final stage in 2011-12 
Kharkiv was selected as a venue for [[Euro 2012]] and the city hosted three matches in the group stage. Yaroslavsky had already initiated a modernization program for the sports infrastructure of [[Kharkiv]], including reconstruction of the stadium of [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|FC Metalist]]. In total, Yaroslavsky`s investment in Kharkiv in preparation for Euro 2012 was $300 million. This included:
1.	Reconstruction of the [[Metalist Stadium]] in a state-private partnership (with Yaroslavsky contributing 30%). The stadium opened on December 5, 2009.
2.	Building a modern training ground for [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|FC Metalist]] - 100% financed by Yaroslavsky. During [[Euro 2012]] this was a training camp.
3.	Building a Children's Football Academy - 100% financed by Yaroslavsky. During the preparation and hosting of [[Euro 2012]] this was used as the [[UEFA]] volunteer centre.
Yaroslavsky sold FC Metalist to [[Sergey Kurchenko]] in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Return of the King – Yaroslavsky and Metallist Kharkiv|url=http://futbolgrad.com/return-king-yaroslavsky-metallist-kharkiv/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political activity ==
In 2002-2006, Yaroslavsky was a People's deputy in the [[Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yaroslavsky Attracts International Investors, According to the Head of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine Borys Lozhkin|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/yaroslavsky-attracts-international-investors-according-to-the-head-of-the-presidential-administration-of-ukraine-borys-lozhkin-512525381.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing the [[Party of Greens of Ukraine]] in the IV Convocation. By his own admission, he achieved little in this role and he stood down upon deciding that he had no wish to remain politically active. [https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/07/08/bc-yaroslavsky-idUSnPnbgJCfc+8c+PRN20150708 He has since remained completely outside of Ukrainian politics.] Despite this, research surveys of Kharkiv citizens show that most would like to see him as mayor of the city.

== Charity ==
In October 2010, Yaroslavsky and [[Dmytro Firtash]] (owner of DF Group), at a charity dinner hosted by the [[Elena Pinchuk]] [[ANTIAIDS Foundation]]  paid 1.75 million euros for the painting “In Love” by British artist [[Damien Hirst]]. This remains the most expensive item ever purchased at an auction in Ukraine, and the money went towards expanding a joint project between [[ANTIAIDS]] and the [[Clinton Foundation]].
Together with [[John Elkann]], of the Agnelli dynasty, Yaroslavsky has been involved in projects to develop youth football.
Yaroslavsky supports other charitable projects, including the activities of the "Rіdny Dim" Fund.

== Personal life ==
Yaroslavsky has five children. He enjoys a healthy and sporty lifestyle. He is a keen practitioner of yoga and also enjoys tennis, scuba diving and skiing. 
Yaroslavsky is a keen rugby fan and sponsors RC Olymp in Kharkiv. RC Olymp is the most important rugby club in Ukraine and contributes many players to the national squad. They have won the Ukrainian championship twelve times and are current holders of the Ukrainian Cup. 
He is known as having friendly relations with [[Oleg Deripaska]], [[Roman Abramovich]] and many other members of the international business elite. 
For his contribution to the UEFA 2012 tournament, he was awarded the UEFA Order of Merit.
He has received a number of national awards and awards from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.

The '''Queensland Public Service''' provides [[public service]]s to the people of [[Queensland]], Australia on behalf of the [[Government of Queensland]]. Typically these are services that are deemed important by the government and which the government believes will be delivered less efficiently, effectively or cheaply if outsourced to the private marketplace.

== Organisation structure ==

The [[Queensland Premier]] selects a subset of the [[Members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly]] to be [[Ministers of State|ministers]] who collectively form the [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]. Typically the ministers are members of the same political party as the premier or a closely aligned party. Each minister is assigned one or more portfolios (areas of responsibility), e.g.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = System of government {{!}} About Queensland and its government|url = http://www.qld.gov.au/about/how-government-works/system-of-government/|website = www.qld.gov.au|accessdate = 14 November 2015|first = |last = |publisher = [[Queensland Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* services for residents such as [[healthcare]] and [[education]]
* services to regulate business and promote the development of the economy, including the [[agriculture]], [[mining]], and [[tourism]] industries (three key export industries for Queensland)
* services that provide infrastructure such as [[transport]], [[public works]] and [[emergency service]]s
* services that underpin all of the above, such as [[treasury]] 
Each portfolio has an associated set of departments and agencies which work to provide a wide range of public services related to that portfolio and the administration of legislation related to that portfolio. The leader of each department is known as the [[Director-general|Director-General]], who is the chief executive officer for the department and reports to the relevant Minister.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Director-General then employs staff within the department to provide the services. The Directors-General and their staff are generally known collectively as the Queensland Public Service and the personnel are known as public servants.

Unlike Ministers, who are chosen by elections and political processes, Directors-General and their staff are traditionally selected on merit to positions which are independent of the elections and political processes. However, as some Ministers have felt their vision for their portfolios have been frustrated by a Director-General who did not embrace their vision, Directors-General are now sometimes replaced by an incoming Minister who makes their own appointment (often by invitation) of a person who the Minister believe shares their vision. While such Directors-General are technically public servants, they are generally regarded as political appointments and their tenure is often linked to the tenure of the Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Premier sacks directors-general|url = http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/premier-annastacia-palaszczuk-sacks-directorsgeneral-20150225-13oulq.html|website = Brisbane Times|accessdate = 2015-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statutory authorities ==
A [[statutory authority]] is an organisation established under separate legislation to manage a particular aspect of government administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.qld.gov.au/about/how-government-works/system-of-government/#_statutory-bodies|title=System of Government|publisher=Queensland Government|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most statutory bodies have their own board of management, selected or appointed in different ways. However, all must report to a Minister.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Statutory authorities have varying degrees of independence to the government and public service. Some statutory authorities are dependent on government subsidies and grants and hence likely to very highly attuned to the wishes of the Minister and/or Director-General; others are funded in other ways (e.g. providing services) and enjoy greater independence as a consequence. However, as all statutory authorities exist under Queensland legislation, the Minister can assert control by changing the legislation within the [[Queensland Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.premiers.qld.gov.au/publications/categories/reviews/assets/part-a-report-independent-review-of-govt-bodies.pdf|title = A Public Interest Map: An Independent Review of Queensland Government Boards, Committees and Statutory Authorities|date = 1 December 2008|accessdate = 14 November 2015|website = |publisher = [[Queensland Government]]|last = Webbe|first = Simone|pages = 33–41|last2 = Weller|first2 = Pat}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly, employees of statutory authorities are not part of the Queensland Public Service, but where their positions are funded by the Queensland Government they are often treated as members of the Queensland Public Service for statistical and budgetary purposes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Statistics ==
At 30 June 2015, there were 243,163 staff (203,348.50 full-time equivalent) employees in 20 Queensland Government departments and 15 other organisations included for statistical purposes. The three largest government employers are [[Queensland Health]], the [[Department of Education and Training (Queensland)|Department of Education and Training]] and the [[Queensland Police Service]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.psc.qld.gov.au/publications/workforce-statistics/assets/qtly-workforce-profile-june15.pdf|title = Queensland Public Sector Quarterly Workforce Profile as at June 2015|date = |accessdate = 14 November 2015|website = |publisher = [[Queensland Government]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rein Lang''' (born 4 July 1957) is an [[Estonia]]n politician, a member of the [[Estonian Reform Party]] since 1995, and a [[diplomat]]. He was the [[Minister of Culture (Estonia)|Minister of Culture]] in [[Andrus Ansip's third cabinet]] until his resignation.

== Personal life ==
Lang was born at [[Tartu]]. His father was appointed to work at the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] embassy in [[Helsinki]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Postimees]] February 22, 2005: [http://www.postimees.ee/230205/esileht/siseuudised/158475.php Soome ajaleht: Lang on «kõva pähkel»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050309075329/http://www.postimees.ee/230205/esileht/siseuudised/158475.php |date=2005-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; consequently, Rein Lang grew up partly in [[Finland]], becoming a fluent speaker of [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. He has championed Finnish-Estonian relations. Lang received elementary and high school education in [[Tallinn English College]] (then known as 7th High School of Tallinn) and graduated ''[[cum laude]]'' from the [[University of Tartu]] in 1980, acquiring a degree in [[law]].&lt;ref name="ministryofjustice"&gt;[http://www.just.ee/minister Justiitsministeerium&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716080352/http://www.just.ee/minister |date=2007-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lang [[cohabitation|cohabits]]&lt;ref name="ministryofjustice"/&gt; with [[Ulvi Kuusk]], whom he met in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;[[Äripäev]] 2 February 2007: [http://www.aripaev.ee/3484/uud_uudidx_348404.html Rein Lang — Lapsesuu või PR-guru?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716094835/http://www.aripaev.ee/3484/uud_uudidx_348404.html |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of 2007 has one teenage daughter.&lt;ref name='epl-lang-50'/&gt;

==Career==
In the later years of the [[Soviet Union]], starting in 1986, Lang worked in the entertainment business. He was a deputy director of the [[Linnahall]] and in 1989 became a deputy director of the club 'Muusik' ([[Estonian language|Estonian]] for 'Musician'). In 1990, he became [[CEO]] of [[AS Laulusillad]] ([[Estonian language|Estonian]] for ''Song Bridges''), and from 1991&amp;ndash;2001 served at various positions in [[AS TRIO]] along with [[Hans H. Luik]], establishing and running the first politically independent [[radio]] station in post-Soviet Estonia, [[Radio Kuku]]. Over the next several years, Lang launched two more radio stations: [[Radio Uuno]], a music-only radio station, and the [[Russian language]] [[Radio Tallinn]] (later renamed Radio 100). In 2002, Lang and Luik sold their radio interest to their then co-partner from the [[United States]], [[John Kluge#Metromedia|Metromedia International Group Inc.]]

During his years at [[Radio Kuku]], Lang regularly appeared on [[talk show]]s, gaining considerable reputation as a political commentator.&lt;ref name='epl-lang-50'&gt;[[Eesti Päevaleht]] 30 June 2007: [http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/391607 Rein Lang (50)]&lt;/ref&gt; His most popular programme, the weekly 'Midday Hour' ({{lang-et|[[Keskpäevatund]]}}), has become legendary, and a subject of a number of jokes mostly associated with [[Valdo Jahilo]]. 'Of the state of the state' ({{lang-et|[[Olukorrast riigis]]}}) was also popular.

Following his departure from the media business, Lang served as deputy mayor of [[Tallinn]] from 2001 to 2003 and was a member of [[Riigikogu]] from 2003 to 2005. He served as the Deputy Speaker of Riigikogu and Chairman of its European Affairs Committee. In 2005, Lang was the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Estonia)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] for two months, from February to April. With the resignation of [[Juhan Parts]], the [[prime minister]] at that time, a new cabinet was proposed by [[Andrus Ansip]]; there, Lang served as the [[Minister of Justice (Estonia)|Minister of Justice]], a position he officially took when the new cabinet took an oath on 12 April 2005. As the [[Estonian Minister of Justice]], Lang was involved in the [[Constitutional Pilsener]] project.

From 21 May 2009 to 4 June 2009 he was also the acting [[Minister of the Interior (Estonia)|Minister of the Interior]].

==Controversies==

=== Press enemy of 2004 ===
{{see also|Eesti Ajalehtede Liit#Press Friend Award}}
In 2004, the Estonian Newspaper Association ({{lang-et|[[Eesti Ajalehtede Liit]]}}) labelled Lang the 'Year's Press Enemy'.&lt;ref&gt;Estonian Newspaper Association 10 December 2004: [http://www.eall.ee/uudised/2004/10_12_4.html Pressisõber on Marko Pomerants, pressivaenlane Rein Lang]&lt;/ref&gt; The explanation provided in the press release cited Lang's [[snob]]bish attitude towards the press, exemplified by an [[email]] response in which Lang asked a county newspaper's correspondent to "not bother" him with any more requests for information. Lang has disputed this characterisation, and implied that [[Toomas Leito]], leader of the Estonian Newspaper Association, was following a policy of [[And you are lynching Negroes|"lynching Negroes"]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Postimees]] 8 January 2005: [http://www.postimees.ee/120105/lisad/arter/154537_1.php Liberaalne Molekul] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050319001850/http://www.postimees.ee/120105/lisad/arter/154537_1.php |date=2005-03-19 }}, interview by [[Priit Pullerits]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversial "Delfi bill" ===
In autumn of 2005, Lang initiated a bill that would have allowed penalising web portals for anonymous comments left by their visitors. The bill, nicknamed the "[[Delfi bill]]" ({{lang-et|Delfi eelnõu}}) after the Estonian web portal [[Delfi.ee]], which is commonly associated with offensive user comments, was widely criticised and ended up rejected by the [[Riigikogu]].&lt;ref&gt;[[delfi.ee]] November 1, 2005: [http://www.delfi.ee/archive/article.php?id=11516527&amp;categoryID=120&amp;ndate=1130864089 Sõnavabadus internetis ohus]&lt;/ref&gt; Among other concerns, critics commonly pointed out that Delfi belonged to a media concern competing with [[AS TRIO]], and questioned the minister's neutrality.  The bill became law in June 2006.&lt;ref name='ee-pulst'&gt;[[Eesti Ekspress]] 6 November 2008: [http://www.ekspress.ee/2008/11/06/eesti-uudised/5212-morvar-nouab-netikommentaatorilt-pool-miljonilt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first lawsuit involving the [[Delfi bill]] was brought by [[Leo Pulst]] in late 2008.&lt;ref name='ee-pulst' /&gt;

=== Birthday party controversy ===
On 4 July 2007 Rein Lang celebrated his 50th birthday at a beer restaurant in Tartu, Estonia.&lt;ref name='ee-juubel'&gt;[[Eesti Ekspress]] July 4, 2007: [http://www.ekspress.ee/viewdoc/9DC2BBB5B3E1EEB4C225730E0023D9BE Langi juubelil "Adolf"] by [[Alan Proosa]]&lt;/ref&gt; The party featured a performance of the play ''[[Adolf (drama)|Adolf]]'', an award-winning [[anti-fascist]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Pip Utton]], describing the play on a [http://www.pip-utton.com/putton/adolf.htm promotional website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072205/http://www.pip-utton.com/putton/adolf.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='epl-lang-review'&gt;[[Eesti Päevaleht]] July 9, 2007: [http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/392468 REIN LANG: Mis siis tegelikult toimus?]&lt;/ref&gt; [[drama]] by [[Pip Utton]], featuring a [[Flag of Nazi Germany|Nazi banner]] as a stage [[Theatrical property|prop]]. In an additional note on the invitation Lang pointed out that the event was not intended as a [[fancy dress party]]; specifically, guests would not be expected to arrive in uniforms or bearing Nazi symbols.&lt;ref name='ee-juubel'/&gt;&lt;ref name='epl-lang-review'/&gt; The Russian media [[spin (public relations)|spun]] this event as the minister "decorating his birthday with [[swastika]]s",&lt;ref name='pm-rus-acc'&gt;[[Postimees]] July 6, 2007: [http://www.postimees.ee/060707/esileht/siseuudised/270888.php Rein Langi juubelipidu äratas huvi Vene meedias] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708182114/http://www.postimees.ee/060707/esileht/siseuudised/270888.php |date=2007-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www2007"&gt;[[Eesti Päevaleht]] July 6, 2007: [http://www.epl.ee/artikkel/392259 Vene meedia haaras Rein Langi sünnipäeva mõnuga hambusse], edited by [[Tuuli Aug]]&lt;/ref&gt; citing an Estonian newspaper which recalled a scandal that happened three years ago, when [[Prince Harry]] had a swastika on his sleeve during a birthday party.&lt;ref name="regnumswastika"&gt;[[REGNUM]] July 5, 2007: [http://www.regnum.ru/english/852694.html Estonian justice minister “decorates” his birthday party with swastika] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708214257/http://www.regnum.ru/english/852694.html |date=2007-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This distortion was widely covered in the Estonian news media.&lt;ref name='pm-rus-acc' /&gt;&lt;ref name="www2007"/&gt; The [[Nochnoy Dozor (advocacy group)|Nochnoy Dozor]] group has, in [[Russia]]n media, made calls for the Minister of Justice to resign over the event.&lt;ref&gt;[[ITAR-TASS]] July 5, 2007: [http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11695348&amp;PageNum=0 Estonian minister marks jubilee under aegis of Nazi Swastika] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712060001/http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=11695348&amp;PageNum=0 |date=2007-07-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an explanatory [[opinion article]], Lang stated ''"The Republic of Estonia has condemned Nazi crimes and my birthday was attended by people who, without exception, despise fascism."''&lt;ref name='epl-lang-review'/&gt; [[Trivimi Velliste]], speaking on [[TV3 (Estonia)|TV3]], has called Russian media's distorted coverage of this incident a case of [[psychological warfare]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Postimees]] 28 July 2007: [http://www.postimees.ee/280707/esileht/siseuudised/274489.php TV3: vabadusvõitlejate kokkutulekut jälgis RTRi võttegrupp]{{Dead link|date=December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Wikigate" incident ===
On 23 July 2007 Lang's article on [[English Wikipedia]] was edited by a user identifying as "Kairioun", removing a large section on Lang's birthday controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Postimees]] 25 July 2007: [http://euro.postimees.ee/250707/esileht/siseuudised/273911.php Langi nõunik toimetas ministri kohta käivat artiklit Wikipedias] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720125640/http://euro.postimees.ee/250707/esileht/siseuudised/273911.php |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eesti Päevaleht]] 26 July 2007: [http://www.epl.ee/?uudised=394214 Langi nõunik üritas parandada ministrit käsitlevat Wikipedia artiklit] by Jan Jõgis-Laats&lt;/ref&gt; After these deletions were consistently reverted, another user by the alias of Gerog112 performed a similar deletion many times, resulting in a 24-hour restriction of editing privileges (sometimes mistakenly reported as a three-month restriction), and made a number of bizarre statements in Estonian. News media quickly traced the user Kairioun to Kairi Õun, an advisor of Lang, leading to considerable coverage of the incident, which [[Henrik Roonemaa]], in an analysis session in [[Tehnokratt]], dubbed "Wikigate".&lt;ref&gt;[[Tehnokratt]] 28 July 2007: [http://akamai.tehnokratt.net/podvaar/tehnokratt/tehnokratt20070728.mp3 tehnokratt vikipeediast ja reeglitest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224217/http://akamai.tehnokratt.net/podvaar/tehnokratt/tehnokratt20070728.mp3 |date=2007-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerog112's real life identity remains unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5742">'''Rotary wheel blow molding systems''' are used for the high-output production of a wide variety of plastic extrusion [[blow molding|blow molded]] articles.  Containers may be produced from small, single serve [[bottles]] to large containers up to 20-30 liters in volume - but wheel machines are often sized for the volume and dimensional demands of a specific container, and are typically dedicated to a narrow range of bottle sizes once built.  Multiple [[parison]] machines, with high numbers of molds are capable of producing over one million bottles per day in some configurations.

== Description ==
Rotary blow molding "wheels" are targeted to the high output production of containers.  They are used to produce containers from one to seven layers.  View stripe and In Mold Labeling (IML) options are available in some configurations.  Rotary wheels, which may contain from six to thirty molds, feature continuously extruded parisons.  Revolving sets of blow molds capture the parison or parisons as they pass over the extrusion head.  The revolving sets of molds are located on clamp "stations".

Rotary wheels come in different variations, including both continuous motion and indexing wheels, and vertical or horizontal variations. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wheel machines are favored for their processing ease, due to having only single (or in some cases, two) parisons, and mechanical repeatability.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Rotary Wheel Blow Molder.png|450px|thumb|left|Rotary wheel blow molding machine operation]] --&gt;

In some machinery configurations, the molds take on the shape of a "pie" sector.  Thus, if two or more parisons are used, each blow molded "log" has a unique length, requiring special downstream handling and trimming requirements.  In other machine configurations, the molds utilize "book style" opening mechanisms, allowing multiple parisons of equal length.  However, machines of this style typically have lower clamp force, limiting the available applications.

The mold close and open actuation is typically carried out through a [[linkage (mechanical)|toggle mechanism]] linkage that is activated during the rotational process by stationary cams. This mechanical repeatability is considered an advantage by most processors.

The method of wheel rotation is typically conducted through an electric motor with a "pinion" gear or small gear to or in mesh with a rotating "bull" gear or large gear. All utilities for blowing containers and for mold cooling are carried through the main shaft or the axle from which the wheel rotates about. These utilities include compressed air and water. Sequencing functions necessary to inflate the parison, hold the container prior to discharge and discharge are completed by mechanical actuation to [[pneumatic]] valves – resulting in a high degree of repeatability.

==Advantages &amp; disadvantages==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Captured Parison.png|160px|thumb|right|Schematic showing captured parisons in a dual parison rotary wheel mold]] --&gt;

Very tight weight and dimensional tolerances can be obtained on wheel equipment, as the parison is captured on both ends.  It is pinched in the preceding mold on the leading end, and positioned by the stationary flowhead die on the other end.  In [[shuttle machinery]] and [[reciprocating screw machinery]] multiple parisons are extruded and are free hanging.  Because there is always some variation in the parison length on these machines, bottle weight and tolerance consistencies are not as tight as on rotary wheel machinery.

Other advantages of wheel equipment include:
* Continuous extrusion
* Multi-layer coextrusion, with one to seven layers of plastic in the finished part
* In some applications, In Mold Labeling (IML) can be integrated with little or no cycle time penalty
* Parison programming capability, for optimization of wall thickness
* Reduced cycle time on light weight containers, compared to shuttle machinery.  Conversely, wheel equipment may suffer cycle time penalties on thick containers
* Easily implemented view stripe capability
* Ability to achieve very high outputs from a single machine - lowest "cost per bottle" when compared to other blow molding equipment
* Higher production efficiencies than most other extrusion blow molding equipment types

Disadvantages:
* Inability to produce bottles with calibrated neck finishes
* Downstream trimming required
* Machines typically dedicated to a narrow range of sizes.  Product change can be difficult, especially when downstream trimming changeovers are required.
* High initial capital investment

== Applications ==

The growth of wheel machinery in the United States was spurred by the conversion of [[motor oil]] containers from [[paperboard]] cans to plastic [[bottle]]s, and the conversion of [[laundry detergent]] from powder to liquid form.  Additional high volume applications have included single-serve [[juice]]s and drinkable [[yogurt]], [[condiment]]s, and household cleaning supplies.

[[File:Bracing for a short, sharp jab.jpg|thumb|Services include a wide range of commercial and not-for-profit transactions including personal services, professional services, entertainment and leisure services.]]
'''Services marketing''' is a specialised branch of [[marketing]]. [[Service (economics)|Services]] marketing emerged as a separate field of study in the early 1980s, following the recognition that the unique characteristics of services required different strategies compared with the marketing of physical goods.

Services marketing typically refers to both [[business to consumer]] (B2C) and [[business-to-business]] (B2B) services, and includes marketing of services such as [[telecommunications service]]s, [[financial service]]s, all types of hospitality, [[tourism]] leisure and entertainment services, [[car rental]] services, [[health care]] services and [[professional services]] and trade services. Service marketers often use an expanded [[marketing mix]] which consists of the [[seven Ps]]: product, price, place, promotion, people, physical evidence and process. A contemporary approach, known as ''service-dominant logic'', argues that the demarcation between products and services that persisted throughout the 20th century was artificial and has obscured that everyone sells service. The S-D logic approach is changing the way that marketers understand ''[[value proposition|value-creation]]'' and is changing concepts of the [[consumer]]'s role in service delivery processes.

==Services: definitions==

The [[American Marketing Association]] defines services marketing as an organisational function and a set of processes for identifying or creating, communicating, and delivering value to customers and for managing [[customer relationship]] in a way that benefit the organisation and stake-holders. Services are (usually) intangible economic activities offered by one party to another. Often time-based, services performed bring about desired results to recipients, objects, or other assets for which purchasers have responsibility. In exchange for money, time, and effort, service customers expect value from access to goods, labor, professional skills, facilities , networks, and systems; but they do not normally take ownership of any of the physical elements involved.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Lovelock and Jochen Wirtz (2011), ''Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy,'' 7th ed., Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, Prentice Hall&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''A service encounter''' can be defined as the duration in which a customer interacts with a service. The customer's interactions with a service provider typically involve face-to-face contact with service personnel, in addition to interactions with the physical elements of the service environment including the facilities and equipment. &lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A.and Milner, R., "The Impact of Mood on Customer Behavior: Staff Mood and Environmental Factors,"  ''Journal of Retail and Consumer Services,'' Vo. 20, 2013, p. 634&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concepts of service==

[[File:Advokat, Engelsk advokatdräkt, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|Classical economists believed that service work, no matter how honourable, was 'unproductive'.]]

Scholars have long debated the nature of services. Some of the earliest attempts to define services focused on what makes them different from goods. Late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth century definitions highlighted the nature of ownership and wealth creation. Classical economists contended that goods were objects of value over which ownership rights could be established and exchanged. Ownership implied possession of a tangible object that had been acquired through purchase, barter or gift from the producer or previous owner and was legally identifiable as the property of the current owner. In contrast, when services were purchased, no title to goods changed hands.

===Historical perspectives===

[[Adam Smith]]'s seminal work, ''The Wealth of Nations'' (1776), distinguished between the outputs of what he termed "productive" and "unproductive" labor. The former, he stated, produced goods that could be stored after production and subsequently exchanged for money or other items of value. But unproductive labor, however "honourable, ...useful, or... necessary" created services that perished at the time of production and therefore didn't contribute to wealth.

French economist [[Jean-Baptiste Say]] argued that production and consumption were inseparable in services, coining the term "immaterial products" to describe them.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., ''The Wealth of Nations,''1776&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, [[Alfred Marshall]] was still using the idea that services "are immaterial products."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, A., ''Principles of Economics'', 8th edition (1920), Macmillan, London&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid nineteenth century [[John Stuart Mill]] wrote that services are "utilities not fixed or embodied in any object, but consisting of a mere service rendered ...without leaving a permanent acquisition."&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S., ''Principles of a Political Economy'', 1852 vol. 1, J.W. Parker, London, 1852&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary perspectives===

When services marketing emerged as a separate sub-branch within the marketing discipline in the early 1980s, it was largely a protest against the dominance of prevailing product-centric view.&lt;ref&gt;Gummesson, E.,  "Implementing the Marketing Concept: From Service and Values to Lean Consumption," ''Marketing Theory,'' [Invited Commentary], vol. 6, no. 3, 2006, pp 291–293&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schembri, S., "Rationalizing Service Logic, or Understanding Services as Experience?" ''Marketing Theory,'' vol 6, no. 3, 2006, pp 381–392.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, the US economy changed forever. In that year, for the first time in a major trading nation, more people were employed in the service sector than in manufacturing industries.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, D., ''The Coming of a Post-Industrial Economy,'' (1973), Basic Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Other developed nations soon followed by shifting to a service based economy.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, B., ''Sleepers Wake! Technology and the Future of Work,'' Oxford University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars soon began to recognise that services were important in their own right, rather than as some residual category left over after goods were taken into account. This recognition triggered a change in the way services were defined. By the mid twentieth century, scholars began defining services in terms of their own unique characteristics, rather than by comparison with products.&lt;ref&gt;Berry, L.L. and Parasuraman, A., 
"Building a New Academic Field: The Case of Services Marketing," ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 69, no. 1, 993, pp 13-60&lt;/ref&gt; The following set of definitions shows how scholars were grappling with the distinctive aspects of service products and developing new definitions of service.&lt;ref&gt;Furrer, O. and Sollberger,  P., "The Dynamics and Evolution of the Service Marketing Literature: 1993–2003," ''Service Business,'' vol. 1, no. 2, 2006, pp 93-117&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fisk., R. and Grove,  S.J., [http://www.ifm.eng.cam.ac.uk/ssme/papers/Fisk_ssme_cambridge_07.pdf "The Evolution of Services: Building a Multi-disciplinary Field"],  [unpublished manuscript], 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative view===
A recently proposed alternative view is that services involve a form of rental through which customers can obtain benefits.&lt;ref name="Lovelock 2004 20-41"&gt;Lovelock, C. and Gummesson, E., "Whither Services Marketing?: In Search of a New Paradigm and Fresh Perspectives", ''Journal of Service Research,'' vol 7, no. 1, 2004, pp 20-41&lt;/ref&gt; Customers are willing to pay for aspirational experiences and solutions that add value to their lifestyle. The term, rent, can be used as a general term to describe payment made for use of something or access to skills and expertise, facilities or networks (usually for a defined period of time), instead of buying it outright (which is not even possible in many instances).&lt;ref name="Lovelock 2004 20-41"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C. and Wirtz, J., ''Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy,'' p. 14, 7th ed., Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, Prentice Hall. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

There are five broad categories within the non-ownership framework
# Rented goods services: These services enable customers to obtain the temporary right to use a physical good that they prefer not to own (e.g. boats, costumes)
# Defined space and place rentals: These services obtain use of a defined portion of a larger space in a building, vehicle or other area which can be an end in its own right (e.g. storage container in a warehouse) or simply a means to an end (e.g. table in a restaurant, seat in an aircraft)
# Labor and expertise rental: People are hired to perform work that customers either choose not to do for themselves (e.g. cleaning the house) or are unable to do due to the lack of expertise, tools and skills (e.g. car repairs, surgery)
# Access to shared physical environments: These environments can be indoors or outdoors where customers rent the right to share the use of the environment (e.g. museums, theme parks, gyms, golf courses).
# Access to and usage of systems and networks: Customers rent the right to participate in a specified network such as telecommunications, utilities, banking or insurance, with different fees for varying levels of access

==Services: Unique characteristics==

[[File:Cosmetologist applying skincare treatment.jpg|thumb|A distinctive feature of services is that production and consumption cannot be separated.]]
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, the so-called unique characteristics of services dominated much of the literature.

The four most commonly cited characteristics of services are:&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V.A, Parasuraman, A. and Berry, L.L., "Problems and Strategies in Services Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,'' 
Vol. 49, No. 2, 1985, pp. 33-46&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Intangibility'' – services lack physical form; they do not interact with any our senses in a conventional way, they cannot be touched or held. 
: Implications of intangibility: Ownership cannot be transferred, value derives from consumption or experience, quality is difficult to evaluate prior to consumption or purchase.
 
:''Inseparability'' – production and consumption cannot be separated (compared with goods where production and consumption are entirely discrete processes)
: Implications of inseparability: Services are typically high contact systems and are labour-intensive; fewer opportunities to transact business at arm's length, fewer opportunities to substitute capital for labour; subject to human error.

:''Perishability'' – service performances are ephemeral; unlike physical goods, services cannot be stored or inventoried.
: Implications of perishability: Demand is subject to wide fluctuations, no inventory to serve as a buffer between supply and demand; unused capacity cannot be reserved; high opportunity cost of idle capacity.

:''Variability'' (also known as heterogeneity) – services involve processes delivered by service personnel and subject to human variation, customers often seek highly customised solutions, services are inherently variable in quality and substance.
: Implications of variability: Service quality is difficult to manage; fewer opportunities to standardise service delivery.

The unique characteristics of services give rise to problems and challenges that are rarely paralleled in product marketing.Services are complex, multi-dimensional and multi-layered. Not only are there multiple benefits, but there are also a multiplicity of interactions between customers and organisations as well as between customers and other customers.

==Framework==

===Classification of goods and services===

{{See also|Search good|Experience good|Credence good}}

There are many ways to classify services. One classification considers who or what is being processed and identifies three classes of services: people processing (e.g. beauty services, child care, medical services); mental stimulus processing (e.g. education services, counselling services, life-coaching), possession processing (e.g. pet care, appliance repair, piano tuning) and information processing (e.g. financial services, data warehousing services).&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C. and Wirtz, j., ''Services Marketing: People, Technology, Strategy,'' 7th ed., 2010, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C., "Classifying Services to Gain Strategic Insight," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 47, Summer, 1983, pp 9-20&lt;/ref&gt; Another method used to classify services uses the degree of customer interaction in the service process and classifies services as ''high contact'' (e.g. hospitality, dental care, hairdressing) or ''low contact''  (e.g. telecommunications, utility services).&lt;ref&gt;Grove, S.J., Fisk, R.P. and  John, J., "Services as Theater: Guidelines and Implications,"  in ''Handbook of Services Marketing and Management,'' Swartz, R., and Iacobucci, D (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2000, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Both economists and marketers make extensive use of the Search → Experience → Credence (SEC) classification of goods and services. The classification scheme is based on the ease or difficulty of consumer evaluation activities and identifies three broad classes of goods.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, G.T., Smith, D.B.  and Swasy, J.L. [http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/6817/volumes/v15/NA-15 "An Empirical Test of the Search, Experience and Credence Attributes Framework"], in ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' Vol. 15, Micheal J. Houston (ed.), Provo, UT : Association for Consumer Research, pp 239-244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, V-W. and Greatorex, M. "Risk Perception and Reduction in the Purchase of Consumer Services," ''The Service Industries Journal'', Vol. 13, no. 4, 1993, pp 179-200&lt;/ref&gt;

Taylor Forester makes a few last minute decisions before purchasing a gold necklace from a Navy Exchange vendor aboard the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan (CVN 76).jpg|thumb|Search goods possess qualities that can be evaluated prior to consumption through direct inspection of the merchandise.]]

: ''Search goods'': are those which possess attributes that can evaluated prior to purchase or consumption. Consumers rely on prior experience, direct product inspection and other information search activities to locate information that assists in the evaluation process. Most products fall into the search goods category (e.g. clothing, office stationery, home furnishings).

: ''Experience goods'': are goods or services that can be accurately evaluated only after the product has been purchased and experiences. Many personal services fall into this category (e.g. restaurant, hairdresser, beauty salon, theme park, travel, holiday).

: ''Credence claims'': are goods or services that are difficult or impossible to evaluate even after consumption has occurred. Evaluation difficulties may arise because the consumer lacks the requisite knowledge or  technical expertise to make a realistic evaluation or, alternatively because the cost of information-acquisition is prohibitive or outweighs the value of the information available. Many professional services fall into this category (e.g. accountant, legal services, medical diagnosis/treatment, cosmetic surgery). These goods are called credence products because the consumer's quality evaluations depend entirely on the trust given to the product manufacturer or service provider.&lt;ref&gt;Jourdan, P., [http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/11342/volumes/ap04/AP-04 "Search Or Experience Products: an Empirical Investigation of Services, Durable and Non-Durable Goods"], in:  ''Asia Pacific Advances in Consumer Research '', Volume 4, Paula M. Tidwell and Thomas E. Muller (eds), Provo, UT, Association for Consumer Research,(2001), pp 167-174&lt;/ref&gt;

While some services may possess a number of search attributes (tangible dimensions), most services are high in experience or credence properties.  Empirical studies have shown that consumers' perceived risk increases along the search-experience-credence continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Mitra,K., Reiss, M.C. and Capella, L.M., "An Examination of Perceived risk, Information Search and Behavioral Intentions in Search, Experience and Credence Services", ''Journal of Services Marketing,'' Vol. 13, no.: 3, 1999, pp 208-228&lt;/ref&gt; The implication is that services tend to be high involvement decisions – where the consumer invests more heavily in information search activities during the purchase decision.

=== Risk perception and risk reduction in service purchase decisions ===
{{See also|Consumer behaviour}}

[[File:FGSQJ.jpg|thumb|Consumers are often nervous about air travel. Although the risk of a negative outcome is low, the severity of consequences is high in the event of a service failure.]]

Perceived risk is associated with all purchasing decisions, both products and services alike. In terms of risk perception, marketers and economists argue that perceived purchase risk is higher for [[experience good]]s and [[credence goods]] with implications for consumer evaluation processes.&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V. A., ''How Consumer Evaluation Processes Differ Between Goods and Services,'' (1981), in:  ''AMA Conference Proceedings'', James H. Donnelly and William R. George (eds), Chicago IL: American Marketing Association, p. 186-190&lt;/ref&gt; Given that perceived risk drives the search for information in the pre-purchase stages of the consumer's decision process, consumers of services are more likely to engage in information acquisition activities as a means of ameliorating that risk. Any activity that a consumer undertakes in an effort to reduce perceived risk is known as a ''risk reduction activity''.

Risk perception has been defined as "a perception or feeling "based on consumer's judgments of the likelihood of negative outcomes (uncertainty) and the degree of importance of these outcomes to the individual [consequences]".&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C., Patterson, P. and Writz,J.,  ''Services Marketing: An Asia Pacific Perspective,'' Pearson, 2011 , p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, pre-purchase risk is a function of two dimensions, namely:

: ''Uncertainty'': the consumer's subjective assessment of the likelihood of occurrence 
: ''Consequence'': the severity of the outcome for the individual in the event that a poor purchase decision is made

For example, consider the case of a prospective air traveller. Most of us know that the probability of being involved in an airline disaster is low (low uncertainty).&lt;ref&gt;Ross, I., [http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/5741/volumes/v02/NA-02 "Perceived Risk and Consumer Behavior: a Critical Review"], in ''Advances in Consumer Research,''Volume 2, Mary Jane Schlinger (ed), MI, Association for Consumer Research, 1975, pp 1-20&lt;/ref&gt; It is conventional wisdom that travellers are safer in the air than on the roads. Statistically, you are much more likely to be involved in a vehicular accident that an aircraft disaster. While the likelihood of personal harm arising from air travel is indeed very low, the consequences or an airline disaster however are very serious indeed (high consequence).  Whereas, car travellers who have been involved in a traffic accident often walk away with minor injuries, the same cannot be said for airline travellers.  It is the severity of the consequence rather than the uncertainty that plays into airline passengers' fears. Consumers are constantly weighing up uncertainty and consequences to reach subjective evaluations of the overall risk attached to various purchase decisions.

Risk perception drives the information search process. Heightened risk perception may become a barrier to the natural progression of the purchase decision process and prevent customers from making a final brand choice. Consumers who are risk-averse tend to spend more time and effort engaged in information acquisition in the pre-purchase stage and look for specific types of information that will alleviate their perceptions of risk. Typical ''risk relievers'' might include such things as a reliance on personal sources of recommendation including word-of-mouth referrals; reliance on known and trusted brands, reading manufacturers' specifications, limited scale trial, reliance on warranties or guarantees etc.&lt;ref name="Dowling, G.R 1994, pp. 119-134"&gt;Dowling, G.R. and Staelin, R., "A Model of Perceived Risk and Intended Risk-Handling Activity," ''Journal of Consumer Research'', Vol. 21, No. 1, 1994, pp. 119-134&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mc Donalds Winterthur-Grüze Ladentheke.jpg|thumb|Standardisation, sometimes called the McDonald's approach, helps to reduce perceived risk because consumers can rely on a known product and quality.]]

Risk relievers that are especially relevant in service settings include:&lt;ref name="Dowling, G.R 1994, pp. 119-134"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, V-W.  and  Greatorex, M., "Risk Perception and Reduction in the Purchase of Consumer Services," ''Service Industries Journal'', 1993, pp 179-200&lt;/ref&gt;

:''High price maintenance:'' Some evidence suggests that risk-averse consumers often use high price as a guide to quality. Low prices may therefore be counter-productive since they suggest lower quality. Prestige pricing or premium pricing strategies are more likely to be indicated in service settings.

: ''Limited scale trial:'' While some services cannot be fully trialled, marketers should think about limited scale trial or a virtual trial. e.g. use computer-aided design to visualise hairstyles, plastic surgery, Many virtual brand sites found online have successfully built of the notion of limited trial.  Other examples include: test driving a software application.

:''Standardise the Product and Delivery:'' This is sometimes known as the McDonald's approach. Since variations in quality contribute to higher levels of perceived risk, one technique is to minimise variations by using production line techniques to control standards. This approach may be limited because many customers expect high levels of flexibility and customisation as part of the process. Standardisation needs to be fully communicated to customers – existing and potential – to be fully effective.

: ''Purchase from a known or trusted brand'': Consumers of services may be more predisposed to use a known, reputable brand as an indicator of quality merchandise. For this reason, service providers are presented with greater opportunities to engage in relationship marketing

===Matching supply and demand===

Service operations are often characterised by far more uncertainty with respect to the flow of demand. Service firms are often said to be ''capacity constrained''.&lt;ref name="Lovelock. C.H. 1984, pp 12-30"&gt;Lovelock. C.H., "Strategies for Managing Demand in Capacity -Constrained Service Organisations," ''Services Industries Journal,'' vol.4, no. 3, 1984, pp 12-30,&lt;/ref&gt;  This refers to the finite carrying capacity for most service operators and the lack of inventory which serves as a buffer against unexpected or peak demand.

There are two components to capacity (i.e., supply) in service operations:
:''Number of employees'':  In medium and high contact systems, capacity is constrained by the number of contact staff available to provide service.

:''Size of service environment'': Service environments have fixed space. A restaurant has a given number of tables, a hotel has a limited number of rooms, buses and trains are licensed to carry a specified number of passengers.

The factors contributing to uneven demand are more complex and difficult to predict. The components of demand may be seen as comprising long term demand patterns (trends), short term seasonal fluctuations and irregular effects.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau of Statistics, [http://www.abs.gov.au/websitedbs/d3310114.nsf/4a256353001af3ed4b2562bb00121564/b81ecff00cd36415ca256ce10017de2f!OpenDocument ''Time Series: The Basics'']&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Long-term demand patterns:'' Most industries exhibit underlying trends in demand over longer time frames.  A trend is the long term direction in a time-series. Are sales growing, declining or stable? Often the trend in sales is related to the stage of the product life cycle. For example, industries in growth stages exhibit rapid increases in sales while industries in maturity may find that sales figures reach a plateau. Long-term demand patterns are stable and relatively easy to predict.

:''Seasonal Factors:'' Seasonal components are systematic, calendar-related movements in sales.  Seasonal factors are recurring and relatively easy to predict. Seasonal factors might include peak and off peak seasons for a tourist resort. For a restaurant, however, peak seasons might coincide with main meal periods on a daily basis.  Other seasonal factors include trading day trading day effects and holiday periods.

: ''Irregular Fluctuations:''  Irregular fluctuations are unsystematic, short term fluctuations. Irregular effects are highly unpredictable. e.g. inclement weather closes an airport, forcing local hotels to accommodate thousands of guests with minimal advance warning; an unexpected thunder storm leads to a surge in demand for umbrellas.

When demand is low, capacity may be under-utilised while excess demand places enormous pressures on the service system. Service managers need to develop strategies for managing demand and supply under different conditions. Strategies for managing capacity involve careful consideration of both demand-side considerations and supply-side considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Mudie, P. and Pirrie, A., ''Services Marketing Management,'' 3rd ed., Butterworth-Heinemann, 2006; especially see Chapter 8 "Demand &amp; Capacity Management" pp 157-176&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:McDonald's trash (4970792904).jpg|thumb|Using customers' labour to clean tables and dispose of rubbish, as in this McDonald's restaurant, reduces pressures on the operating system by freeing up employees to focus on core service activities.]]

On the capacity side:&lt;ref name="Lovelock. C.H. 1984, pp 12-30"/&gt;

:''Add to capacity'' – hire additional staff (e.g. casuals or temporary staff for peak periods); add to space (e.g. extra floor space in retail, hospitality or increased fleet size in transport services) Increasing capacity may require service re-design and presents a longer term solution to capacity problems.
:''Reconfigure interior space'' – with careful reconfiguration of interiors, it may be possible to accommodate a larger number of customers e.g. airline s to add to number of seats by reducing leg room.
:''Use Customers to Boost Productivity'' – Customers labour can be harnessed to reduce pressures on the system e.g. self-service, e-ticketing.
:''Transact business at arm's length'' – Use the internet or virtual delivery systems to transact business. 
:'' Ask Customers to use Third Parties'' – Where possible, have customers use agents or brokers to minimise the number of individual contacts and reduce pressure on the service system.
:'' Share capacity'' – it may be possible to share capacity with other businesses e.g. airlines build strategic alliances with other operators so that excess demand can be booked or referred to a known ally (and does not involve  passengers losing frequent flyer points).

On the demand side:&lt;ref&gt;Blois, Keith J., "Productivity and Effectiveness in Service Firms," ''Service Industries Journal,'' vol. 4 no. 3, 1984, pp 49-60&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reception desk with a computer at a restaurant.JPG|thumb|Hotels and restaurants use computerised reservations systems to manage demand and supply.]]

:''Locate and target market segments with different demand patterns'' – e.g. a ski resort could develop fishing and sight-seeing packages for bushwalkers and anglers to build demand during traditional off peak seasons.
:''Develop innovative products for off peak periods'' – e.g. an airline could develop mystery flights, fly over Antarctica specials, singles flights, blues or jazz flights, gourmet flights, fight sensitivity training flights for nervous travellers, Winter wonderland specials, etc (a medium term strategy).
:''Use efficiency based pricing methods'' – price incentives, such as time-based differential pricing (peak and off peak); market-based differential pricing (e.g. economy and business class); price-volume discounts, use pricing to encourage pre-booking which facilitates superior forecasting  e.g. Car hire company, Uber, uses ''surge pricing'' during periods of high demand.
:''Use reservations systems to manage demand'' – ''yield management'' or ''dynamic pricing'' which uses a combination of segment-by-segment demand forecasting alongside subtle price adjustments (requires sophisticated software programs to analyse demand) e.g. hotels and airlines utilise yield management to set prices based on demand patterns.
:''Use stand-by systems'' – allow customers the option of taking up last minute vacancies or "no-show" places.
:''Shape demand''- management may attempt to shape demand patterns through customer education programs or lobbying e.g. encourage engaged couples to hold wedding ceremonies on days other than Saturday spread demand more evenly across the days of the week, lobby different state authorities to stagger scheduled school holiday periods in order to spread demand for holiday services more evenly across the year.

When demand exceeds capacity, then reductions in service quality are a probable outcome. Over-crowding and lengthy waiting lines potentially erode the customer experience and place stresses on employees and the service system. Employees may compensate by minimising the time spent with each customer in an effort to serve more people, but such responses have the potential to introduce human error into service delivery. When capacity far exceeds supply, then capacity becomes idle. Spare capacity is unproductive and an inefficient use of resources. A short-term solution to spare capacity is to seek reductions in operating costs. For instance, management might ask staff to take leave, reduce number of check in counters open, limit number lifts operating and close off entire floors of a building to reduce operating costs during off peak periods as a means of achieving cost savings. In addition, routine maintenance tasks or planned refurbishment activities, which involve downtime, should be carried out during off peak periods to minimise disruption to patrons.

====Managing waiting lines====

When demand exceeds capacity, customers may have to wait for services. Lovelock identifies a range of different types of waiting lines or queuing systems:&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C. H. Patterson, P. G. and Walker, R.H. (2007), Services Marketing: An Asia-Pacific Perspective, Pearson Education Australia, French's Forest, NSW, pp 288-289&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Types of queing systems.jpg|thumb|Different types of queues]]

: ''Single Line/ Single Server Queues'': Single line queues are among the most common. Examples can be found in cafes and sandwich bars around town. At Disneyland, for example, single line queues are employed despite the large numbers of visitors. However, Disney provides roving entertainers to visit waiting lines as a form of distraction.

: ''Parallel Lines/ Multiple Servers'': Parallel lines are useful when there is more than one service station. However a major drawback is lines often move at different speeds. When patrons perceive that their line is moving more slowly, it can give rise to a sense of inequity. A variation of this type of queue is to devote some stations to different classes of customer. This variation is used in supermarkets where an express lane can be set up for customers with a small basket of items. It is also used at airport check-in counters where different lines form for economy class passengers and business class passengers.

: ''Snake Queue'': The snake queue employs a physical race to guide customers through to the service station. Its main advantage is that all customers will be served on a first-in, first served basis, which for many people is the fairest system.

: ''Take a Number'': In the take a number system customers do not need to form orderly queues once they have been assigned a number. Instead, customers can relax, enjoy the service firm's facilities until their number is called.

: ''Other queue systems'': Of course, other types of system can be found in service environments. Hospital emergency department, for example, use ''[[Triage]]'' in which patients are assessed by a triage nurse who ranks the severity of their condition and assigns them to a doctor based on need.

{{See also|Marketing mix|E. Jerome McCarthy}}

The argument that services require different marketing strategies is based on the insight that services are fundamentally different to goods and that services marketing requires different models to understand the marketing of services to customers.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Eugene W., Claes Fornell, and Roland T. Rust, ''Customer Satisfaction, Productivity, and Profitability: Differences Between Goods and Services," ''Marketing Science,'' vol 16, no.2, 1997, pp 129-145.&lt;/ref&gt;  The "marketing mix" (also known as the ''four Ps'') is a foundation concept in [[marketing]] and has defined the so-called managerial approach since the 1960s.  The marketing mix or marketing program is understood to refer to the "set of marketing tools that the firm uses to pursue its marketing objectives in the target market".&lt;ref&gt;Kotler, P., ''Marketing Management'' (Millennium Edition), Custom Edition for University of Phoenix, Prentice Hall, 2000, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: ''product'', ''price'', ''promotion'', and ''place''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing. A Managerial Approach|year=1964|publisher=Irwin|location=Homewood, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, Christian. "From Marketing Mix to Relationship Marketing: Towards a Paradigm Shift in Marketing," ''Management Decision,''  vol. 32, no.2, 1994, pp 4-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expanded and modified marketing mix===

[[File:7 ps of services marketing.jpg|thumb|The seven Ps of services marketing]]

The prospect of expanding and modifying the marketing mix for services first took hold at the inaugural AMA Conference dedicated to Services Marketing in 1981, and built on earlier theoretical works pointing to many important limitations of the 4 Ps concept.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, R.P., Brown, W. and Bitner, M.J., "Tracking the Evolution of Services Marketing Literature, ''Journal of Retailing'', vol. 41 (April), 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Taken collectively, the papers presented at that conference indicate that service marketers were thinking about a revision to the general marketing mix based on an understanding that services were fundamentally different to products, and therefore required different tools and strategies. At the Services Marketing Conference in 1981, Booms and Bitner proposed a model of seven Ps, comprising the original four Ps plus ''process, people'' and ''physical evidence'', as being more applicable for services marketing.&lt;ref&gt;Booms, B. and Bitner, M. J. "Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms" in  James H. Donnelly and William R. George (eds), ''Marketing of Services'', Chicago: American Marketing Association, 47–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then there have been a number of different proposals for a service marketing mix (with various numbers of Ps – 6 Ps, 7 Ps, 8 Ps, 9 Ps and occasionally more). The model of 7 Ps has gained widespread acceptance, to the extent that some theorists have argued for the 7 Ps framework proposed by Booms and Bitner to be applied to products as a replacement for the four Ps.&lt;ref&gt;Rafiq,M. and Ahmed,P.K. "Using the 7Ps as a Generic Marketing mix: An Exploratory Survey of UK and European Marketing Academics", ''Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning'', Vol. 13, no. 9, pp 4–15&lt;/ref&gt;

The extended marketing mix for services is more than the simple addition of three extra Ps. Rather it also modifies the traditional mix of product, price, place and promotion for superior application to services.

==== Product====

[[File:Total service product concept.jpg|thumb|Visualisation of the total service product concept]]

Service products are conceptualised as consisting of a bundle of tangible and intangible elements:&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, K. D., Bateson, J.E.G., Elliot, G. and Birch, D., ''Service Marketing. Concepts, Strategies and Cases,'' Asia-Pacific Ed., Cengage Learning, Australia, 2010, pp 171-73&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Core service:'' the basic reason for the business; that which solves consumer problems

: ''Supplementary goods and services:'' supplements or adds value to the core product and helps differentiate the service from competitors   (e.g. consultation, safe-keeping, hospitality, exceptions)

: ''Facilitating services'': (sometimes called ''delivery services''): Facilitate the delivery and consumption of the core service (are essential to delivery) (e.g. information provision, order-taking, billing, payment methods)

: ''Supporting services'':  support the core and could be eliminated without destabilising the core.

The distinction between supplementary and facilitating services varies, depending on the nature of the service. For instance, the provision of coffee and tea would be considered a supporting service in a bank, but would be a facilitating service in a bed and breakfast facility. Whether an element is classified as facilitating or supporting depends on the context.

==== Price====

Service marketers need to consider a range of other issues in price setting and management of prices:

* '''Price Charged:''' the traditional [[pricing]] decision. 
* '''Timing of Payment:''' Given that customers are part of the service process and that some customers remain in the process for days, months or even years (e.g. guest house, hotel stay, university tuition), decisions must be made about whether to request payment at time when the service encounter is initiated, during the encounter or on termination of an encounter. Deposits, installments and exit fees are all options that can be considered.
* '''Mode of Payment:''' Given that customers enter into long term relationships with service providers, it is possible that some patrons will expect to be able to pay on account. Payment options include: EFTPOS, direct transfer, cash/ credit cheque, invoice.

Many service firms operate in industries where price is restricted by professional codes of conduct or by government influences which may have implications for pricing. It is possible to identify three broad scenarios:&lt;ref&gt;Cowell, D., ''The Marketing of Services,'' pp 147-60&lt;/ref&gt;
* Services subject to public regulation (e.g. healthcare, public transport)
* Services subject to formal self-regulation  (e.g. universities, schools)
* Services Subject to regulation of marketplace  (e.g. hospitality, tourism, leisure services)
In situations where the service is subject to some type of public regulation, government departments may establish [[ceiling price]]s which effectively limit the amount that can be charged.

The concept of a ''social price'' may be more important for service marketers. A social price refers to "non financial aspects of price". Fine identifies four types of social price: Time, Effort, Lifestyle and Psyche.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, S.,''Social Marketing,'' Allyn and Bacon, 1991, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, this means that consumers may be more acutely aware of the opportunity costs associated with the consumption of a service. In practice, this may mean that consumers of services experience a heightened sense of ''temporal risk.''

The most widely used pricing tactics in services marketing are: &lt;ref&gt;Kapoor, R., Paul, J. and Halder, B., ''Service Marketing: Concepts &amp; Practices'', Tata McGraw-Hill Education, 2011, p. 79;  Chowhan, S.E., ''Marketing of Services'', Lulu.com, 2015, pp 33-34&lt;/ref&gt;

* High or low [[Pricing#Differential pricing|differential pricing]]
* Flexible pricing
* [[Pricing#Diversionary pricing|Diversionary pricing]]
* [[Pricing#Offset pricing|Offset pricing]]
* [[Pricing#Guaranteed pricing|Guaranteed pricing]]
* [[Pricing#Loss leader|Loss leader]] pricing
* Discounted pricing

==== Place====
In making place decisions, there are several related questions which must be asked. What is the purpose of the distribution program? Who are the customers? Who should the intermediaries be?

* Purpose of Distribution: Mass distribution; selective distribution or exclusive distribution
* Number of levels in distribution channel: Direct distribution vs multi-marketing  and location decisions &lt;ref&gt;Donnelly, J.H., "Marketing Intermediaries in Channels of Distribution for Services," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 40, January, 1976, pp 55 -70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Light, D., "A Guide for New Distribution Channel Strategies for Service Firms," ''Journal of Business Strategy,'' vol. 7, Summer, 1986 and reproduced in John Bateson, ''Managing Services Marketing'', pp 427 -428&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Egan, D., "The Location of Service Outlets: An Economist's Perspective," ''Service Industries Journal,'' vol. 3, no. 2, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
* Intermediaries: Agents versus Resellers; Brokers and other parties; Surrogate Consumers &lt;ref&gt;Bergen, M., Shanatu,D. and Walker, O.C., "Agency Relationships In Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, July, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, M.R., " The Role of the Surrogate Consumer in Service Delivery," ''Service Industries Journal,'' vol. 9, no. 2, 1987, pp 292-307&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Promotion====

===The expanded marketing mix===

Contemporary service marketing texts tend to be organised around a framework of ''seven Ps'' or ''eight Ps.'' The 7 Ps comprises the original 4 Ps plus ''process'', ''people'', ''physical environment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Booms|first=Bernard H.|author2=Bitner, Mary Jo|title=Marketing Strategies and Organization Structures for Service Firms|journal=Marketing of Services. American Marketing Association|year=1981 |pages=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''eight Ps'' framework; comprises the 7 Ps plus ''performance'' which refers to the standards of service performance or service quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kotler |first=Philip |title=Marketing Management |year=2012 |page=25 |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical evidence====

Given the intangible nature of services, consumers often rely on the physical evidence to evaluate service quality. Therefore, service marketers must manage the physical evidence – which includes any element of the service environment which impacts on one or more of the customers five senses – the sense of smell, taste, hearing, sight and touch.&lt;ref&gt;Shostack, G.L., "Breaking Free from Product Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 41, no. 2, 1977, pp 73-80&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists identify two types of physical evidence, namely;&lt;ref&gt;Shostack, G.L., "How to Design a Service," in Donnelly an, J.H. and George, W.R. (eds), ''Marketing of Services'', [AMA Special Conference on Services Marketing], American Marketing Association, Chicago. Ill, 1981, pp 221-29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Credit-cards.jpg|thumb|Credit cards have no independent value unless backed by the service. Credit cards are a type of peripheral evidence.]]

:''Peripheral evidence:'' is actually possessed as part of the purchase of a service but has no independent value unless backed by the service.  e.g. a cheque book,  credit card, admission ticket, hotel stationery.
: ''Essential evidence:'' unlike peripheral evidence cannot be possessed by the client. It contributes to ambience or image e.g. building and furnishings, layout, equipment, people etc

A number of different theoretical traditions can be used to inform the study of service environments including stimulus-organism-response (SOR) models; [[environmental psychology]]; [[semiotics]] and Servicescapes.

=====Stimulus-response models=====
{{See also|Stimulus-response theory}}

The SOR model (stimulus→organism→response model) describes the way that organisms, which includes both customers and employees, respond to environmental stimuli. In a service setting the environmental stimuli might include lighting, ambient temperature, background music, layout and interior-design. In essence, the model proposes that people's responses exhibit both emotional and behavioural responses to stimuli in the external environment.

===== Environmental psychology=====
{{See also|Environmental psychology}}

[[File:Environmental psychology model.jpg|thumb|]]
Environmental psychologists investigate the impact of spatial environments on behaviour. Emotional responses to environmental stimuli fall into three dimensions; pleasure, arousal and dominance. The individual's  emotional state is thought to mediate the behavioural response, namely approach or avoidance behaviour towards the environment. Architects and designers can use insights from environmental psychology to design environments that promote desired emotional or behavioural outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Donovan and Rossiter, J., "Store Atmosphere: An Environmental Psychology Approach," ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol;. 58, no. 1, 1982, pp 34-57&lt;/ref&gt;

Three emotional responses are suggested in the model. These responses should be understood as a continuum, rather than a discrete emotion, and customers can be visualised as falling anywhere along the continuum.&lt;ref&gt;Ridgway, Dawson and Bloch (1990) "Pleasure and Arousal in the Marketplace: Interpersonal differences in approach-avoidance responses," ''Marketing Letters,'' vol 1, no 2, pp 139-47&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Pleasure–displeasure'' refers to the emotional state reflecting the degree to which consumers and employees are satisfied with the service experience.

:''Arousal–non-arousal'' refers to the emotional state that reflects the degree to which consumers and employees feel excited and stimulated.

:''Dominance–submissiveness'' refers to the emotional state that reflects the degree to which consumers and employees feel in control and able to act freely within the service environment.

[[File:Woolworths Closing-down Sale, Grimsby - geograph.org.uk - 1076911.jpg|thumb|Crowded, disorganised, unpredictable environments are said to be high load.]]

The individual's emotional response mediate the individual's behavioural response of ''Approach→ Avoidance.'' Approach refers to the act of physically moving towards something while avoidance interferes with people's ability to interact. In a service environment, approach behaviours might be characterised by a desire to explore an unfamiliar environment, remain in the service environment, interact with the environment and with other persons in the environment and a willingness to perform tasks within that environment. Avoid behaviours are characterised by a desire to leave the establishment, ignore the service environment, and feelings disappointment with the service experience. Environments in which people feel they lack control are unattractive. Customers often understand the concept of approach intuitively when they comment that a particular place "looks inviting". The desired level of emotional arousal depends on the situation. For example, at a gym arousal might be more important than pleasure (No Pain; No gain). In a leisure setting, pleasure might be more important. If the environment pleases, then the customer will be induced to stay longer and explore all that the service has to offer. Too much arousal can be counter-productive. For instance, a romantic couple might feel out of place in a busy, noisy and cluttered restaurant. Obviously, some level of arousal is necessary as a motivation to buy. The longer a customer stays in an environment, the greater the opportunities to cross-sell a range of service offerings.

Mehrabian and Russell identified two types of environment based on the degree of information processing and stimulation:&lt;ref&gt;Mehrabian,A. and Russell, J.A., ''An  Approach  to  Environmental  Psychology,'' Cambridge, MA, MIT  Press&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''High load'': Environments that are unfamiliar, novel, complex, unpredictable or crowded are high load

: ''Low load'':  Environments that are familiar, simple, unsurprising and well organised are low load.

Activities or tasks that are low load require a more stimulating environment for optimum performance. If the task to be performed in relatively simple, routine or boring then users benefit from a slightly more stimulating environment. On the other hand, tasks that are complex or difficult may benefit from a low load environment. In a service environment, a high load environment encourages patrons to enter and explore the various service offerings and spaces.

===== Servicescapes=====
{{See also|Servicescape}}
 
[[File:Servicescapes.pdf|thumb|Simplified servicescapes model]]

The servicescapes model was developed by Mary Jo Bitner and published in 1992. It is an applied model, specifically developed to inform the analysis of service environments, and was influenced by both stimulus-response theory and environmental psychology.

======Physical environment dimensions======

As the diagram of the servicescapes model illustrates, the service environment consists of physical environment dimensions which act as stimuli. Environmental simulis are normally considered as three broad categories including:&lt;ref&gt;Bitner, M.J., "Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 57 -71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katz, K.L. and Rossiter, J.,  "Store Atmosphere: An Environmental Psychology Approach," in Bateson, J.E.G., ''Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases and Readings'', Dryden, Orlando, Fl, 1991, pp 227-243&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Ambient Conditions'': Temperature, air quality, ambient noise, lighting, background music, odor, etc

: ''Space/ Function'': Equipment such as cash registers, layout, furnishings and furniture, etc

: ''Signs, symbols &amp; Artefacts'': Directional signage, personal artefacts (e.g. souvenirs, mementos), corporate livery and logos, style of décor (including colour schemes), symbols etc

[[File:Savoy Boutique private seminar room - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The seminar room at the Savoy Hotel clearly signals an up-market positioning. Spacious room, high backed covered chairs, timber surfaces and a complementary bar combine to communicate that this in intended for corporate use.]]

Each element in the physical environment serves specific roles -and some may perform multiple roles. Signage may provide information, but may also serve to assist customers navigate their way through a complex service environment. For instance, furnishings may serve a functional role in that they provide seating, but the construction materials, such as fabric, tapestry and velvet may serve a symbolic role. Plush fabrics and generous drapery may suggest an elegant, up-market venue, while plastic chairs may signify an inexpensive, family-friendly venue.  When evaluating the servicescape, the combined effect of all the elements must also be taken into consideration.

======The holistic environment ======
When consumers enter a servicescape, they scan the ambient conditions, layout, furnishings and artefacts and aggregate them to derive an overall ''impression'' of the environment. In other words, the ''holistic environment'' represents the cumulative effect of multiple stimuli, most of which are processed within a split second. These types of global judgments represent the summation of processing multiple stimuli to form a single, overall impression in the consumer's mind.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, K. D., Bateson, J. E.G., Elliot, G. and Birch, D., ''Service Marketing. Concepts, Strategies and Cases,'' Asia-Pacific Edition, Cengage Learning Australia, 2010, pp 209-215&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Seminar room, Singapore University of Technology and Design - 20150602-02.jpg|thumb|The seminar room at Singapore University clearly signals an institutional application. Functional seating, ceiling mounted projectors, whiteboard, fluorescent lighting and schoolroom layout combine to suggest that the space is part of a practical educational environment.]]

Through careful design of the physical environment and ambient conditions, managers are able to communicate the service firm's values and positioning. Ideally, the physical environment will be designed to achieve desired behavioural outcomes. Clever use of space can be used to encourage patrons to stay longer since longer stays result in more opportunities to sell services. At other times, the ambient conditions can be manipulated to encourage avoidance behaviour. For example, at the end of a busy night of trading, a bar manager might turn the air conditioning up, turn up the lights, turn off the background music and start stacking chairs on top of tables. These actions send a signal to patrons that it is closing time.

======Customers and employees: moderating and mediating factors ======

Customers and employees represent the two groups that regularly inhabit the servicescape. Their perceptions of the environment are likely to differe, because each comes to the space with different purposes and motivations. For example, a waiter in a restaurant is likely to be pleased to see a crowded dining room because more customers means more tips. Customers, on the other hand, might be less pleased with a crowded space because the noise and queues have the potential to diminish the service experience.

In the servicescape model, a moderator is anything that changes the standard stimulus-response emotional states of pleasure-displeasure, arousal-non-arousal or dominance-submissiveness while the mediator explains the response behaviour, typically in terms of internal responses (cognitive, emotional and physiological responses).&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, K.D. and Bateson, J.E. G., ''Services Marketing: Concepts, Strategies, &amp; Cases,'' Cengage, 2017, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The consumer's response to an environment depends, at least in part, on situational factors such as the purpose or reason for being in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Bitner, M.J., "Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 64-65&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a waiter in a restaurant is likely to be pleased to see a crowded dining room because more customers means more tips. Customers, on the other hand, might be less pleased with a crowded space because the noise and queues have the potential to diminish the service experience.

======Behavioural response======

The model shows that there are different types of response – individual response (''approach'' and ''avoid'')  and  interaction responses (e.g.''social interactions'').

In the context of servicescapes, ''approach'' has a special meaning.  It refers to how customers utilize the space, during and after the service encounter. Approach behaviours demonstrated during the encounter include:&lt;ref&gt;Bitner, M.J., "Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 60-63&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Enter and explore'' – exhibiting a desire to explore the total service offering, a willingness to do more things, keen to learn about all the company's products and services; showing an interest in [[cross-selling]] opportunities as presented

: ''Stay longer'' – exhibiting a willingness to remain within the physical environment; longer stays present more opportunities for cross-selling, up-selling or impulse buying. Some studies have shown a correlation between length of stay and the size of average patron expenditure

: ''Carry out plan'' – exhibiting a willingness to act on information provided, fully immerse themselves in the experience and a determination to achieve personal goals

: ''Social interactions'' refer to customer-employee interactions as well as customer-customer interactions. In some services, such as clubs, bars and tours, the act of meeting other people and interacting with other customers forms an integral part of the service experience. Managers need to think about design features that can be used to facilitate interactions between patrons. For instance, some cafeterias and casual dining establishments install communal dining tables for the express purpose of encouraging customers to mix and socialise.

[[File:CentralPark Vendor.JPG|thumb|Kiosks are lean servicescapes - simple, orderly, few employees, few spaces and familiar environments.]]

Different types of approach behaviours demonstrated at the conclusion of the encounter or after the encounter may include: ''affiliation'' – a willingness to become a regular user, form intention to revisit; ''commitment'' – the formation of intention to become brand advocate, to provide referrals, write favourable online reviews or give positive word-of-mouth recommendations.

======Types of servicescape======

Bitner's pioneering work on servicescapes identified two broad types of service environment:&lt;ref&gt;Bitner, M.J., "Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, pp 58-59&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Harrods Food Hall - geograph.org.uk - 908825.jpg|thumb|Department stores offer an elaborate servicescape with multiple levels and spaces, rich in physical elements and symbolism.]]
: ''Lean servicescapes'' – environments that comprise relatively few spaces, contain few elements and involve few interactions between customers and employees. e.g. kiosks, vending machines, self-service retail outlets, fast food outlets. Designing lean environments is relatively straight-forward

: ''Elaborate servicescapes'' – environments that comprise multiple spaces, are rich in physical elements and symbolism, involve high contact services with many interactions between customers and employees. Examples include international hotels and ocean liners with guest accommodation, concierge, bars, restaurants, swimming pools, gymnasiums and other supplementary services where guests interact with multiple personnel during their stay which might extend over multiple days. Designing elaborate environments requires skilled design teams who are fully apprised of the desired behavioural outcomes and the corporate vision.

According to the model's developer, the servicescape acts like a "product's package" – by communicating a total image to customers and providing information about how to use the service. It can also serve as a point of difference by signalling which segments of the market are served, positioning the organisation and conveying competitive distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Bitner, M.J., "Servicescapes: The Impact of Physical Surroundings on Customers and Employees," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol. 56, no. 2, 1992, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Service process===

When customers enter a service firm they participate in a process. During that process, customers become quasi-employees; that is they are partial producers and they have the opportunity to see the organisation from the employee's perspective. To use a manufacturing analogy, customers are able to examine 'unfinished goods' – that is faulty and defective goods, glitches in the production system are in full view, with obvious implications for customer enjoyment and satisfaction. In addition, customers interactions with both employees and other customers becomes part of the total service experience with obvious implications for service quality and productivity.  Both customers and staff must be educated to effectively use the process. Controlling the service delivery process is more than a simple management issue. The customer's presence in the system means that the service process must be treated as a marketing issue.

====Blueprinting for design and diagnosis====

{{See also|Service blueprint}}

[[File:Service blueprint.jpg|thumb|A service blueprint for a hypothetical fast food outlet]]

Blueprinting is a technique designed to document the ''visible'' customer experience.&lt;ref&gt;Shostack, G. L., "Service Positioning through Structural Change," ''Journal of Marketing'', vol. 51, no. 1, 1987, pp 34-43&lt;/ref&gt; In its simplest form, the service blueprint is an applied process chart which shows the service delivery process from the customer's perspective. The original service blueprint is a highly visual, graphical map that delineates the key contact points in the service process and the nature of the contact – whether with physical evidence, personnel or procedures. It can be seen as a two dimensional map in which the horizontal axis represents time and the vertical axis represents the basic steps in the process.  A line of visibility is included to separate actions visible to the customer from actions out of sight.  Employee latitude, which refers to the amount of discretion given to employees to vary the service process, is shown on the map a call-out sign attached to the step a shown in the figure. Process complexity is shown simply by the number of steps in the process.

It was originally intended to be used as a tool to assist with service design and structural positioning.&lt;ref&gt;Shostack, G. Lynn. [http://hbr.org/1984/01/designing-services-that-deliver/ar/1 "Designing Services that Deliver"], ''Harvard Business Review'', vol. 62, no. 1 January - February 1984, pp 133–139&lt;/ref&gt;  However, since its inception it has been used extensively as a diagnostic tool, used to detect operational inefficiencies and potential trouble spots including ''fail points'' and ''bottlenecks''.&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, C. H., "Managing Interactions Between Operations and Marketing and their Impact on Customers," in Bowen, D.E. Chase, R.B. and Cummings, T.G. (eds), ''Service Management Effectiveness. Balancing Strategy, organization and Human Resources,'' San Francisco, 1990, pp 343-69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swank, C. K., "The Lean Service Machine, ''Harvard Business Review'', vol. 81 no, 10, 2003, pp 123-129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeithmal, V. A. and Bitner, M.J., ''Services Marketing,'' Mc Graw-Hill, N.Y., 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In the event that any deficiencies are identified by the blueprinting process, management can develop operational standards for critical steps in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Womack, J. P. and Jones, D.  T. , "Lean Consumption," ''Harvard Business Review'', vol. 83, no. 3, 2005, pp 58-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V.A., Bitner, M. J. and Gremler, D. D. (2006), ''Services Marketing: Integrating Customer Focus Across the Firm'', 4th ed, Boston, MA, McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

When interpreting service blueprints, there are two basic considerations, complexity and divergence. ''Complexity'' refers to the number and intricacy of the steps required to perform the service. ''Divergence'' refers to the degree of latitude, freedom, judgment, discretion, variability or situational adaptation permitted within any step of the process. 
                  
Manipulations of the blueprint diagram might include increasing complexity, by adding more steps, or increasing divergence by allowing employees greater latitude in varying each step. In general, service processes that include high levels of employee discretion to vary steps to meet the needs of individual customers are moving towards customisation. On the other hand, reducing divergence, by standardising each step, often adds to complexity, but can result in a production-line approach to service process design. By manipulating complexity and divergence, it is possible to envisage four different positioning strategies:&lt;ref&gt;Shostack, G.L., "How to Design a Service," in Donnelly an, J.H. and George, W.R. (eds),  ''Marketing of Services'', [AMA Special Conference on Services Marketing], American Marketing Association, Chicago. Ill, 1981, pp 221-29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Subway restaurant in the basement of Raffles City Shopping Centre, Singapore - 20060529.jpg|thumb|Customers doing the 'Subway shuffle' as they move along the race selecting their fillings. Subway has designed the store to facilitate a streamlined process.]]

: ''Reduced Complexity:'' Specialisation strategy
: ''Reduced Divergence:'' Volume-operations
: ''Increase Complexity:''  Product development
: ''Increased Divergence:'' Niche market strategy

Subway sandwich bars provide an excellent example of how a business can integrate both process design and the servicescape into the customer's in-store experience. Like many fast food restaurants, Subway utilises a ''race'' to corral customers and move them in a one-way direction. Prominently displayed 'In' and 'Out' signage reinforces the direction of the desired traffic flow. Customers can peruse an overhead backlit menu while they are waiting in line which speeds up the order-taking process and reduces opportunities for bottlenecks. Other signage provides customers with information about the Subway process e.g. select bread, select filling, select sauce, pay and exit. The arrangement of food behind the glass counter not only displays the choice of sandwich fillings, but supports the process since customers must select their preferences in a specific sequence, as they inch their way towards the cash register. In Australia, the distinctive moves used by Subway customers as they shuffle along the race, selecting their sandwich breads and fillings has become affectionately known as the ‘Subway shuffle'.&lt;ref&gt;''AdBrief'', [https://gotothesource.com.au/content/uploads/2013/02/ADB1792_pf.pdf "Campaign News"] [Australia], Issue no. 1792, 6 March 2009, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''AdNews'', [http://www.adnews.com.au/BC43A782-900D-4850-9710F17CDAB16B0D "Daily Round-Up"] 13 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Every aspect of Subway's store design and layout reinforces the core objectives of customisation, volume-operations (i.e. rapid turnover) and operational efficiency.

===People===

{{See also|Customer experience|Internal communications}}

The ''people'' dimension refers to the human actors who are participants in the service encounter, namely employees and customers.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, D., Bateson, J.E.G., Elliot, G. and Birch, S., Services Marketing: Concepts, Strategies and Cases (Asia-Pacific ed.), Cengage, 2010, pp 226-274&lt;/ref&gt; For many service marketers, the human interaction constitutes the heart of the service experience.&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, J. , ''Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases and Readings,''  Orlando, Fl, Dryden, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Service personnel are important because they are the ''face'' of the company and represent the company's values to customers. Customers are important because they are the reason for being in business and are the source of revenue. Service firms must manage interactions between customers and interactions between employees and customers.&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V. Bitner, M.J. and Gremler, D.D., ''Services Marketing: Integrating Customer Focus Across the Firm,'' 6th ed, New York: McGraw-Hill, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have developed the concept of service-profit-chain to understand how customers and firms interact with each other in service settings.&lt;ref&gt;Loveman, Gary W. "Employee satisfaction, customer loyalty, and financial performance an empirical examination of the service profit chain in retail banking," ''Journal of Service Research,'' vol. 1, no. 1, 1998, pp 18-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Strategically, service personnel are a source of differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, K.D. and  Bateson, J.E.G., ''Services Marketing: Concepts, Strategies, &amp; Cases,'' 5th ed., Boston, MA, Cengage, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Personnel are said to have a ''boundary-spanning role'' because they link the organisation with its external environment by interacting with customers and feed information back to the organisation&lt;ref&gt;Bateson, J. , ''Managing Services Marketing: Text, Cases &amp; Readings,''  Orlando, Fl, Dryden, pp 261-264&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowen, D. E. and Schneider, B., "Boundary Spanning Role Employees and the Service Encounter," in Czepiel, J.A., Surprenant, C.F. and Solomon, M.A. (eds), ''The Service Encounter: Managing Customer Interactions in Service Businesses,'' Lexington Books, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; As boundary spanners, front line staff are likely to encounter the various stresses associated with that role.  Studies have shown that emotional labour can lead to undesirable consequences for employees including job-related stress, burnout, job dissatisfaction and withdrawal. If left untreated, these types of stressors can be very damaging to morale.

Managing the behaviour of customers and employees in the service encounter is difficult. Consistent behaviour cannot be prescribed. It can, however, be nurtured in subtle and indirect ways.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, P. J., "We the People: The Importance of Employees in the Process of Building Customer Experience," ''Journal of Brand Management,'' Vol. 15, pp 102-114, doi:10.1057/palgrave.bm.2550123&lt;/ref&gt;  Recruitment and training can help to ensure that the service firm employs the ''right'' people.

==== A dramaturgical perspective ====

{{See also|Symbolic interactionism|Emotional labor|Behavioral script}}

For some marketing theorists, services are analogous to theatre. This analogy is also known as a ''dramaturgical perspective.'' In such an analogy, service personnel are the ''actors'', customers are the ''audience''; uniforms are ''costumes''; the work setting is the ''stage'' (front-stage for areas where interaction occurs and ''back-stage'' for areas off limits to customers); discrete steps in the service process are ''scenes'' and finally the words and actions that occur represent the ''performance''.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, S.J., Fisk, R.P. and  John, J., "Services as Theater: Guidelines and Implications,"  in ''Handbook of Services Marketing and Management,'' Swartz, R., and Iacobucci, D (eds), Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 2000, pp 21-35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grove, S.J., Fisk, R.P., [http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/7341/volumes/v19/NA-19 "The Service Experience As Theater"], in ''Advances in Consumer Research,'' Vol. 19, John F. Sherry, Jr. and Brian Sternthal (eds), Provo, UT, Association for Consumer Research, pp 455-461&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flambeed (6655111493) (6).jpg|thumb|A waiter adds a touch of theatre to the service delivery.]]

A dramaturgical perspective may be appropriate in specific service contexts:

* high contact services&lt;ref&gt;Grove, S. J. and Fisk, R.P, "Impression Management in Services Marketing: A Dramaturgical Perspective," In ''Impression Management in the Organization,'' in  Robert A. Giacalone and Paul Rosenfeld, eds. Hillsdale, NJ, Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, pp 427-438&lt;/ref&gt;
* services with large audiences e.g. sporting stadia, educational institutions&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, D.V., Davies, B.J., Ward, P. and Lim, M., "A dramaturgical analysis of the service encounter in higher education," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 24, no.1-2, 2008 [Special issue, 'Creating the Service Experience'], pp 47-68, DOI; n https://dx.doi.org/10.1362/026725708X273911&lt;/ref&gt;

Managerial insights generated by a dramaturgical perspective include:&lt;ref&gt;Yagil, D., "Pretending and Dissembling: The Act of Service," [Chapter 1] In ''The Service Providers,'' Palgrave Macmillan, 2008, pp 11-41&lt;/ref&gt;

* differentiates services from manufactured goods – provides a framework and vocabulary for describing and evaluating service performances
* legitimises service work as a skilled performance – recognises that service work is an artistic and creative endeavour
* provides service workers with a mechanism for understanding and coping with role-related stressors (by understanding that they are 'in character' they are less likely to be personally affected by exchanges with difficult customers and the like) 
* focuses managerial attention on recruitment and training – recruiting people with requisite skills and training them as actors
* forces managers to think about the craft of stage management – scripting, staging, scenes, costumes and roles

When asked to perform emotional labour, employees can adopt one of two approaches:&lt;ref&gt;Verma, H.V., ''Services Marketing: Text and Cases,'' 2nd ed., India, Dorling Kindersley, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Deep acting'': the service worker appraises the service environment and regulate their inner feelings, by actually changing their emotions from the outset

:''Surface acting:'' the service worker pretends to express displays of emotion that are consistent with rules and policies

Some evidence suggests that employees who are able to fully immerse themselves in the role and engage in deep acting are more resilient to role-related stress. In addition, deep acting is often seen as  more authentic, while surface acting can be seen as contrived and inauthentic.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, X, Xinmei, L. and Zizhen, G., "Emotional Labor Strategies And Service Performance: The Mediating Role Of Employee Creativity," ''The Journal of Applied Business Research,'' Vol. 29, No. 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Service work, by its very nature, is stressful for employees. Managers need to develop techniques to assist employees manage role related stress.

===Performance: Managing service quality===

{{See also|Service quality}}

There is widespread consensus amongst researchers and practitioners that service quality is an elusive and abstract concept that is difficult to define and measure.&lt;ref&gt;Berry,L.L., Zeithaml, V.A. and Parasuraman, A., "Quality counts in services, too," ''Business Horizons, May–June, 1985, pp 44-52&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to be a multi-dimensional construct, but there is little consensus as to what consistutes the specific dimensions. Indeed, some researchers argue that the dimensions of service quality may vary from industry to industry and that no universal set of dimensions exists for all contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R.E., Hardgrave, B.C. and Jones, R.W., "SERVQUAL Dimensionality: An investigation of presentation order effect," International Journal of Services and Standards, Vol. 7, no. 1 DOI: 10.1504/IJSS.2011.040639&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the services marketing literature, there are several different theoretical traditions that inform the understanding of service quality including the Nordic school, the Gaps model (also known as the ''American model'' and the performance only approach.

====The Nordic school====

The Nordic school was one of the earliest attempts to define and measure service quality. In this school of thought, service quality is conceptualised as consisting of two broad dimensions, namely:&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, C., "A service quality model and its marketing implications," ''European Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 18, No. 4, 1984, 36–44. doi:10.1108/EUM0000000004784&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''Technical quality'': (What was delivered) 
: ''Functional quality'': (How it was delivered)

The technical dimension can usually be measured – but the functional dimension is difficult to measure due to subjective interpretations which vary from customer to customer.&lt;ref&gt;Grönroos, C., ''Service Management and Marketing: Managing the Moments of Truth in Service Competition,'' Lexington, Mass: Lexington Books, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Gaps model====
{{See also|SERVQUAL}}
[[File:Servqual.jpg|thumb|The model of service quality]]

The model of service quality or the ''gaps model'' as it is popularly known, was developed by team of researchers, Parasuraman, Zeithaml and Berry, in the mid to late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A, Ziethaml, V. and Berry, L.L., "SERVQUAL: A Multiple- Item Scale for Measuring Consumer Perceptions of Service Quality' ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 62,  no. 1, 1988, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; and has become the dominant approach for identifying service quality problems and diagnosing their probable causes.&lt;ref&gt;Ladhari, R., "A Review of Twenty Years of SERVQUAL Research", International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences, Vol. 1 no. 2, pp 172–198&lt;/ref&gt; This approach conceptualises service quality  as a gap between consumer's expectations of a forthcoming service encounter and their actual perceptions of that encounter.&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V., Parasuraman, A. and Berry, L.L., ''Delivering Service Quality: Balancing Customer Perceptions and Expectations,'' N.Y., The Free Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, service quality can be represented by the equation:&lt;ref&gt;Zeithaml, V.A., Berry, L.L. and Parasuraman, A., "Communication and Control Processes in the Delivery of Service Quality," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 52, No. 2, 1988, pp. 35-48&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SQ = P- E'''
: where;

: '''SQ''' is service quality
: '''P''' is the individual's perceptions of given service delivery
: '''E''' is the individual's expectations of a given service delivery

The model which provides the overall conceptual framework helps analysts to identify the service quality gap (Gap 5 in the model) and to understand the probable causes of service quality related problems (Gaps 1-4 in the model). The diagnostic value of the model accounts at least, in part, for the instrument's continuing currency in service quality research.&lt;ref&gt;Asubonteng, P., McCleary, K.J. and Swan, J.E.,  "SERVQUAL Revisited: A Critical Review of Service Quality", ''Journal of Services Marketing,'' Vol. 10, no 6, 1996, pp 62-81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ladhari, R., "A review of twenty years of SERVQUAL research", ''International Journal of Quality and Service Sciences,'' Vol. 1 no. 2, pp. 172–198&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nyeck, S., Morales, M., Ladhari, R., &amp; Pons, F., "10 Years of Service Quality  Measurement: Reviewing the use of the SERVQUAL Instrument," ''Cuadernos de Difusion,'' Vol. 7, no 13, pp 101-107.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Measuring service quality using SERVQUAL model (Kumar et al, 2009).png|thumb|The five dimensions of service quality]]

The model's developers also devised a research instrument, called SERVQUAL, to measure the size and direction of service quality problems (i.e. gap 5).&lt;ref&gt;Parasuraman, A., Berry, L.L. and Zeithaml, V.A.,  "Refinement and Reassessment of the SERVQUAL scale," ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 67, no. 4, 1991, pp 57-67&lt;/ref&gt; The questionnaire is multi-dimensional instrument, designed to  having capture five dimensions of service quality; namely reliability, assurance, tangibles, empathy and responsiveness, which are believed to represent the consumer's understanding of service quality. The questionnaire consists of matched pairs of items; 22 expectation items and 22 perceptions items, organised into the five dimensions which align with the consumer's mental map of service quality dimensions. Both the expectations component and the perceptions component of the questionnaire consist a total of 22 items, comprising 4 items to capture tangibles, 5 items to capture reliability, 4 items for responsiveness, 5 items for assurance and 5 items to capture empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Based on Parasuraman, A, Ziethaml, V. and Berry, L.L., "SERVQUAL: A Multiple- Item Scale for Measuring Consumer Perceptions of Service Quality' Journal of Retailing, Vol. 62, no. 1, 1988, [Appendix: SERVQUAL questionnaire, pp 37-40&lt;/ref&gt; The questionnaire, which is designed to be administered in a face-to-face interview and requires a moderate to large size sample for statistical reliability, is lengthy and can take more than one hour to administer to reach respondent. In practice, researchers customarily add extra items to the 44 SERVQUAL items to capture information about the respondent's demographic profile, prior experience with the brand or category and behavioural intentions (intention to revisit/ repurchase, loyalty intentions and propensity to give word-of-mouth referrals). Thus, the final questionnaire may have up to 60 items, which contributes to substantial time and cost in terms of administration, coding and data analysis.

====Performance-only model====

Cronin and Taylor developed a scale based on perceived performance only (i.e. excluded expectations) as a simpler alternative to SERVQUAL.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, J. J. and Taylor, S. A., "Measuring Service Quality: A Re-examination and Extension," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, no. 3, 1992 pp 55-68&lt;/ref&gt; The scale is known as SERVPERF and is considerably shorter than SERVQUAL, and therefore easier and cheaper to administer. Results from the use of SERVPERF correlate well with SERVQUAL.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin J.J., Steven, J. and Taylor, A., "SERVPERF versus SERVQUAL: Reconciling performance based and perceptions-minus-expectations measurement of service quality," ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 58, January, 1994, pp 125-131&lt;/ref&gt; This approach utilises a different conceptualisation of service quality, which can be represented by the equation:

'''SQ = P'''
: where;

: '''SQ''' is service quality
: '''P''' is the individual's perceptions of given service delivery

Although SERVPERF has a number of advantages in terms of administration, it has attracted criticism. The performance only instrument lacks the diagnostic value of the SERVQUAL since it includes only one variable (P) compared to SERVQUAL's richer data with two variables (P and E).&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, K. M., "SERVPERF versus SERVQUAL: A Marketing  Management Dilemma when Assessing Service Quality," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vol. 4, no. 2, 1994, pp 56-61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carrillat, F.A., Jaramillo, F. and Mulki, J.P., "The Validity of the SERVQUAL and SERVPERF Scales: A Meta‐analytic View of 17 years of Research across Five Continents", ''International Journal of Service Industry Management,'' Vol. 18, no. 5, 2007, pp 472-490&lt;/ref&gt; To illustrate, consider one source of quality related problems which occurs when customers have unrealistically high expectations. SERVQUAL has no problem detecting such problems, however, SERVPERF can never detect this problem because it does not capture expectations. When choosing an appropriate instrument for investigations into service quality, service marketers must weigh up the expediency of SERVPERF against the diagnostic power of SERVQUAL.

==Services dominant logic: implications for theory and practice==
{{See also|Service-dominant logic}}

Service-dominant logic (SDL) is a new way of thinking about marketing, especially the goods versus services division and especially a fresh way of thinking about customer value and the value-creation process. Vargo and Lusch did not intend for service-dominant logic to be published as a workable theory that offers solutions to everyday marketing problems and issues. Instead, it offers a framework for thinking about goods and services. Their work did not put forward hypotheses that could be tested empirically, Instead they offer "foundational propositions."  The original article offered eight such propositions&lt;ref&gt;Vargo, S. L. and Lusch, R.F., "Evolving to a New Dominant Logic for Marketing," ''Journal of Marketing,'' vol 68, no. 1, 2004, pp 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently added two more propositions to arrive at a total of ten:&lt;ref&gt;Vargo, S. L. and Robert F. Lusch, "Service-dominant Logic: Continuing the Evolution",  ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 36, no. 1, 2008, pp 1-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the implications that have been identified in the literature include:

''SDL offers the promise of a unified marketing theory'': To date, marketing research and practice have failed to integrate the traditional goods/services dichotomy. Some efforts have been made to get product accepted as a joint term for goods and services and to use offering, package or solution as all inclusive, concepts for what consumers the buys, but this has not been successful.&lt;ref&gt;Gummesson, E., "Exit Services Marketing- Enter Service Marketing," in: Michael Baker and Susan Hart (eds), ''The Marketing Book'', 6th edition, Butterworth-Heinemann, 2008, pp 451-471&lt;/ref&gt; Service-dominant logic, however, promises a truly unified framework. For many academics, this is the most exciting implication. It is highly likely that the 4 Ps, as the central marketing framework, is about to come to a close.

''Compete Through Innovative Co-production and Co-creation'': Some theorists point out that, thanks largely to the Internet, consumers have been actively engaging themselves in explicit dialogue with manufacturers and service providers.&lt;ref&gt;Prahalad, C.K. and Ramaswamy, V. (2000) "Co-opting Customer Competence," ''Harvard Business Review,'' vol. 78, no. 1, pp 79-87&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge is for service firms to find innovative ways to achieve co-production and co-creation. Customer co-creation has become the foundation concept for social sharing web sites such as YouTube, Myspace and Twitter.  Many companies have moved from testing products in the contrived and artificial conditions of a laboratory to product testing in customer environments. At Microsoft, for example, consumers acted as product researchers by testing Windows 2000 in their native environments. A different approach is to use embedded intelligence to provide enhanced personalised experiences.

''Research Priorities'': SDL has forced the discipline to review its research priorities.  Researchers and scholars are beginning to identify a range of subjects that require more detailed exploration. Some theorists have argued that marketing practitioners must find new ways of understanding customers' value creation and of developing marketing strategies with an aim to engage suppliers with their customers' consumption processes in order to enhance customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Vargo, S.L., "Customer Integration and Value Creation: Paradigmatic Traps and Perspectives," ''Journal of Service Research,'' vol. 11, no. 2, 2008, pp 211-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research priorities include: the personalised customer experience,&lt;ref&gt;Lusch, R.F., Vargo, S.L. and O'Brien, M., "Competing through Service: Insights from Service-dominant Logic," ''Journal of Retailing,'' Vol. 83, no. 1, 2007, pp 5-18&lt;/ref&gt; resource integration,&lt;ref&gt;Baron, S.  and Harris, K. "Consumers as Resource Integrators," ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' vol. 24, no. 1/2, 2008, p113-130&lt;/ref&gt; improved use of IT to map processes and activities in order to increase productivity and standardise service.

In [[law]], '''set-off''' or '''netting''' are legal techniques applied between persons with mutual rights and liabilities, replacing gross positions with net positions.&lt;ref&gt;David Southern ''Set off revisited'' (1994) NJL 1412, 1412&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd v Westminster Bank Ltd'' [1970] 3 All ER 473 at 488, per Buckley LJ&lt;/ref&gt; It permits the rights to be used to discharge the liabilities where cross claims exist between a [[plaintiff]] and a [[respondent]]. The result being that the gross claims of mutual debt produces a single, net claim.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, ''Financial Law'' (2007, Oxford University Press), p264&lt;/ref&gt; The net claim is known as a '''[[Financial law|net position]]'''. In other words, a set-off is the right of a debtor to balance mutual debts with a creditor.  In bookkeeping terms, set-offs are also known as reconciliations.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}  To determine a set-off, simply subtract the smaller debt from the larger. 

Any balance remaining due either of the parties is still owed, but the remainder of the mutual debts has been set off. The power of net positions is to reduce [[credit risk|credit exposure]], also holding regulatory capital requirement and settlement advantages, which contributes to [[market stability]]. In regard to the financial market, net positions are vital.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Gullifer, ''Goode and Gullifer on Legal Problems of Credit and Security'' (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th ed 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between Set off and Netting==
Whilst '''netting''' and '''set off''' are often used interchangeably, the legal distinction is made between ''netting'', which describes the procedure for and outcome of implementing a ''set off''. By contrast ''set off'' describes the legal bases for producing net positions. ''Netting'' describes the form such as '''novation netting''', or '''close-out netting''', whilst ''set off'' describes judicially recognised grounds such as '''independent set off''' or '''insolvency set off'''. Therefore, a netting or setting off gross positions involves the use of offsetting positions with the same counter-party to address counter-party credit risk. This is to be differentiated from [[hedge (finance)|hedging]] which uses offsetting positions with multiple parties to mitigate risk.

===Mutuality===
The law does not permit counter-parties to use third party debt to set off against an un-related liability.&lt;ref&gt;P Wood ''Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting'', (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995), 189&lt;/ref&gt; All forms of set off requires mutuality between claim and cross claim. This protects property rights both inside insolvency and out, primarily by ensuring that a non-owner cannot benefit from insolvency.

==Market Effect==
The primary objective of netting is to reduce systemic risk by lowering the number of claims and cross claims which may arise from multiple transactions between the same parties. This prevents credit risk exposure, and prevents liquidators or other insolvency officers from cherry-picking transactions which may be profitable for the insolvent company.&lt;ref&gt;Finch, Milman ''Corporate Insolvency Law'' (2016, Cambridge University Press, Third edition)&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Netting==
At least three principle forms of netting may be distinguished in the financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.worldbank.org/finance/assets/images/Woltjer_paper.pdf |title=Risk Management in Netting schemes for settlement of securities transactions |publisher=World Bank |date=March 2002 |author=Jan Woltjer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each is heavily relied upon to manage financial market, specifically credit, [[financial risk|risk]]
{{Quote|Since claims are a major form of property nowadays and since creditors are often also debtors to the same counterparty, the law of set off is of paramount importance in international affairs|author=P.Wood|title=''Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting'', (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995), 72}} 

===Novation Netting===
Also called '''rolling netting''', netting by [[novation]] involves amending contracts by the agreement of the parties. This extinguishes the previous claims and replaces them with new claims.
{{Quote|Suppose that on Monday, 'A' and 'B' enter into transaction-1, whereby A agrees to pay B £1,000,000 on Thursday. On Tuesday A and B enter into transaction-2, whereby B agrees to pay A £400,000 on Thursday. Novation netting takes effect on Tuesday to extinguish the obligations of the parties under both transaction 1 and 2, and to create in their place a new obligation on A to pay to B £600,000 on Thursday.|author=Benjamin,Joanna|title=''Financial law'' (2007, Oxford University Press), 267}}
This differs from '''settlement netting''' (outlined below) because the fusion of both claims into one, producing a single balance, occurs immediately at the conclusion of each subsequent contract. This method of netting is crucial in financial settings, particularly derivatives transactions, as it avoids cherry-picking in insolvency.&lt;ref&gt;''Commissioner for HMRC v Entin'' [2006] BCC 955 per Lightman J [21]&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of pre-insolvency novation netting in an insolvency was discussed in ''[[British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France]]''[1975] 1 WLR 758. Similar to '''settlement netting''', novation netting is only possible if the obligations have the same settlement date. This means that if, in the above example, transaction-2 was to be paid on Friday, the two transactions would not offset. Novation netting further cannot consolidate obligations. This is a systems intensive process requiring tracking of obligations as they become due.

===Close out netting===
An effective close-out netting scheme is said to be crucial for an efficient financial market.&lt;ref&gt;EFMLG ''The regulation of close out netting in the new member states of the European Union'' 2005, 3&lt;/ref&gt; Close out netting differs from novation netting in that it extends to all outstanding obligations of the party under a master agreement similar to the one used by [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association|ISDA]]. These traditionally only operate upon an event of default of insolvency. In the event of [[counterparty]] [[bankruptcy]] or any other relevant event of default specified in the relevant agreement if accelerated (i.e. effected), all transactions or all of a given type are netted (i.e. set off against each other) at [[market value]] or, if otherwise specified in the contract or if it is not possible to obtain a market value, at an amount equal to the loss suffered by the non-defaulting party in replacing the relevant contract. The alternative would allow the [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] to choose which contracts to enforce and which not to (and thus potentially "cherry pick").&lt;ref&gt;ISDA 2002 Master Agreement, Section 2(1)(a)(iii)&lt;/ref&gt; There are international jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting in bankruptcy has not been legally tested.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}
The key elements of close out netting are:
*default
*the accretion of the time for performance of obligations to the time of default
*conversion of non-cash obligations into debts; meaning obligations to deliver non-cash assets are converted to market price equivalents; and
*set off&lt;ref&gt;See the Financial Collateral Directive (Directive 2002/47/EC, Art 2(1)(n)&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar methods of close out netting exist to provide standardised agreements in market trading relating to derivatives and security lending such as''repos'', forwards or options.&lt;ref&gt;ISDA master agreement&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is that the netting avoids valuation of future and contingent debt by an insolvency officer and prevents insolvency officers from disclaiming executory contract obligations, as is allowed within certain jurisdictions such as the US and UK.&lt;ref&gt;Cf Insolvency Rules 1986 Rule 4.90&lt;/ref&gt; The mitigated systemic risk which is induced by a close out scheme is protected legislatively. Other systemic challenges to netting, such as regulatory capital recognition under [[Basel II]] and other Insolvency-related matters seen in the ''Lamfalussy Report''&lt;ref&gt;European Commission,''Report from the Commission to the Council and European Parliament, Evaluation Report on the Financial Collateral Arrangements Directive'' (2002/47/EC), 2006, COM (2006) 833 final, 10&lt;/ref&gt; has been resolved largely through trade association lobbying for law reform.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, 269&lt;/ref&gt; In England &amp; Wales, the effect of ''[[British Eagle International Airlines Ltd v Compagnie Nationale Air France]]'' has largely been negated by ''Part VII'' of the [[Companies Act|Company Act 1989]] which allows netting in situations which are in relation to money market contracts. In regard to the [[Basel_Accords|BASEL Accords]], the first set of guidelines, [[Basel_I|BASEL I]], was missing guidelines on ''netting''. [[Basel_II|BASEL II]] introduced ''netting'' guidelines.

===Settlement netting===
For [[cash]] settled trades, this can be applied either bilaterally or multilaterally and on related or unrelated transactions.
Obligations are not modified under settlement netting, which relates only to the manner in which obligations are discharged.&lt;ref&gt;P Wood, ''Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting'', (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995),153-5&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike '''close-out netting''', settlement netting is only possible in relation to like-obligations having the same settlement date. These dates must fall due on the same day and be in the same currency, but can be agreed in advance.&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law (2007, Oxford University Press), p274&lt;/ref&gt; Claims exist but are extinguished when paid. To achieve simultaneously payment, only the act of payment extinguishes the claim on both sides. This has the disadvantage that through the life of the netting, the debts are outstanding and netting will likely not occur, the effect of this on insolvency was seen in the above mentioned ''British Eagle''. These are routinely included within [[derivative]] transactions as they reduce the number and volume of payments and deliveries that take place but crucially does not reduce the pre-settlement exposure amount. 

::*''Bilateral Net Settlement System'': A settlement system in which every individual bilateral combination of participants settles its net settlement position on a bilateral basis. 

::*''Multilateral Net Settlement System'': A settlement system in which each settling participant settles its own multilateral net settlement position (typically by means of a single payment or receipt). 

==Set off==
Set off is a legal event and therefore legal basis is required for the proposition of when two or more gross claims are netted. Of these legal bases, a common form is the legal defense of set-off, which was originally introduced to prevent the unfair situation whereby a person ("Party A") who owed money to another ("Party B") could be sent to debtors' prison, despite the fact that Party B also owed money to Party A. The law thus allows both parties to defer payment until their respective claims have been heard in court. This operated as an equitable shield, but not a sword. Upon judgment, both claims are extinguished and replaced by a single net sum owing (e.g. If Party A owes Party B 100 and Party B owes Party A 105, the two sums are set off and replaced with a single obligation of 5 from Party B to Party A). Set-off can also be incorporated by contractual agreement so that, where a party defaults, the mutual amounts owing are automatically set off and extinguished.

In certain jurisdictions (including the UK&lt;ref&gt;[[Insolvency Act 1986]], section 323; [[Insolvency Rules 1986]], rule 4.90.&lt;/ref&gt;), certain types of set-off takes place automatically upon the [[insolvency]] of a company. This means that, for each party which is both a creditor and debtor of the insolvent company, mutual debts are set-off against each other, and then either the bankrupt's creditor can claim the balance in the bankruptcy or the trustee in bankruptcy can ask for the balance remaining to be paid, depending on which side owed the most. The primary argument This has been criticized&lt;ref&gt;Mokal ''Corporate Insolvency Law'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; as an undeclared [[security interest]] that violates the principle of [[pari passu]]. The alternative, where a creditor has to pay all its debts, but receive only a limited portion of the leftover moneys that other unsecured creditors get, poses the danger of 'knock-on' insolvencies, and thus a systemic market risk.&lt;ref&gt;Louise Gullifer, Goode and Gullifer on Legal Problems of Credit and Security (Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 7th ed) 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Goode, ''Principles of Corporate Insolvency'' (Fourth Edition, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2013), 278&lt;/ref&gt; Seven still three core reasons underpin and justify the use of set-off. First, the law should uphold pre-insolvency autonomy and set-offs as parties invariably rely on the pre-insolvency commitments. This is a core policy point. Second, as a matter of fairness and efficiency both outside and inside insolvency reduces negotiation and enforcement costs.&lt;ref&gt;Stein v Blake [1993]; Halesowen Presswork&lt;/ref&gt; Third, managing risk, particularly systemic risk is crucially. Clearing house rules offer stipulation that relationships with buyer and sellers are replaced by two relationships between buyer and clearing house and seller and clearing out. Effect is automatic novation meaning all elements are internalised in current accounts. Can be in different currencies as long as they are converted at calculation. 

The right to set off is particularly important when a bank's exposures are reported to regulatory authorities, as is the case in the EU under financial collateral requirements. If a bank has to report that it has lent a large sum to a borrower and so is exposed because of the risk that the borrower might default, thereby leading to the loss of the money of the bank or its depositors, is thus replaced. The bank has taken security over shares or securities of the borrower with an exposure of the money lent, less the value of the security taken.

===Set-off by Country===
Two primary examples of set-off rules are outlined below. These are in addition to the financial regulations pertaining to netting set out by trade associations and the European Union through the Financial Collateral Directives. 

====English law set-off====
Under English law, there are broadly five types of set-off which have been recognised:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.practicallaw.com/4-107-7242 |title=Practical Law: set-off |publisher=Thompson Reuters |accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roy Goode, ''Principles of Corporate Insolvency'' (Fourth Edition, Sweet &amp; Maxwell 2013), 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Benjamin, Financial Law (2007, Oxford University Press), p274&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Legal set-off.''' or '''Independent set-off'''&lt;ref&gt;P Wood Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting, (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995), 189&lt;/ref&gt; What is known as statutory set-off, this arises where a claim and a counterclaim in a court action are both liquidated sums or ascertained with certainty. This is wider than insolvent set-off, but the claim and cross claim must be mutual ''and'' liquidated. In such cases the court will simply set-off the amounts and award a net sum.  The two claims do not need to be intrinsically connected.
# '''Equitable set-off.''' or '''Transaction set-off''' Outside of litigation, where two mutual claims arise out of the same matter or a sufficiently closely related matter ''and'' an injustice would be done if not enforced, the claims will set off in equity.&lt;ref&gt;P Wood Title Finance, Derivatives, Securitisation, Set off and Netting, (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1995), 189&lt;/ref&gt; Both sums must be due and payable, but may be for liquidated or unliquidated sums. Unlike ''Independent set-off'', this is not self-executing
# '''Contractual Set-off''' made by express agreement. Often netting will arise through express agreement to the parties, the [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association|ISDA]] master agreement is an example of this type, which is ineffective against an insolvent party but is often used to address pre-insolveny credit risk and reduce the need for collateral.
# '''[[Banker's right to combine accounts|Banker’s set-off]].''' or '''Current Account Set-off''' Sometimes referred to as a banker's right to combine accounts, this is a special form of set-off which is implied into contractual agreements with bankers and allows banks to offset sums in one account against another account which is overdrawn from the same client.&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Westminster Bank Ltd v Halesowen Presswork &amp; Assemblies Ltd]]'' [1972] AC 785&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the right cannot be exercised if one of the accounts is a loan account, or if the bank has agreed not to exercise the right, or if the bank has notice that the sums in the account are for a specific purpose,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite bailii |litigants=[[Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd]] |year=1968 |court=UKHL |div= |num=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or on trust for another party. It is said to derive from a bankers' lien, however this is misleading as it is only available where both accounts are maintained in the same capacity. Difference in currency will not prevent this right, however.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Miliangos v George Frank Ltd]]'' [1976] AC 443&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Insolvency set-off.''' It is perhaps the most expensive form of set off. Under section 323 of the [[Insolvency Act 1986]]&lt;ref&gt;Rule 4.90 of the [[Insolvency Rules 1986]] for companies.&lt;/ref&gt; where a person goes into [[bankruptcy]] or a company goes into [[liquidation (law)|liquidation]] mutual debts are automatically set-off. This is a mandatory operation in bilateral situations. Whether the debt is liquidated or unliquidated does not matter, and the set-off will apply to future or contingent claims if the debts are provable. Insolvency set-off operates on liquidation and administration, where the administrator gives notice of his intention to make a distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Rules 14.25 and 14.25 of the Insolvency Rules 1986&lt;/ref&gt;
The five types of set off are extremely important as a matter of efficiency and of mitigating risk. Contractual set offs recognised as an incident of party autonomy whereas banker right of combination is considered a fundamental implied term. It is an essential aspect for cross-claims, especially when there exits overlapping obligations. Common features of set-off are that they are confined to situations where claim and cross claim are for money or reducible to money and it requires mutuality.

====US law set-off====
{{jargon|date=October 2017}}
See De Magno v. United States, 636 F.2d 714, 727 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (district court had jurisdiction over claim involving VA’s “affirmative 
action against an individual whether by bringing an action to recover on an asserted claim or by proceeding on its '''common-law right of set-off'''”) (discussing similar language of predecessor statute, 38 U.S.C. § 211)

See, e.g., United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234, 239, 67 S.Ct. 1599, 1601, 91 L.Ed. 2022 (1947) ("government has the same right 'which belongs to every creditor, to apply the unappropriated moneys of his debtor, in his hands, in extinguishment of the debts due to him' " (quoting Gratiot v. United States, 40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 336, 370, 10 L.Ed. 759 (1841))); see also Tatelbaum v. United States, 10 Cl.Ct. 207, 210 (1986) (set-off right is inherent in the United States government and grounded on common law right of every creditor to set off debts).

'''Teleport''' is a neighborhood of [[Amsterdam]], [[Netherlands]] in the [[Urban districts of the Netherlands|urban district]] of [[Westpoort]].

Teleport was founded in the eighties of the twentieth century as an office location with the designation of "[[Telematics]]." Therefore, it has specific facilities in that area. The neighborhood has connections by road through the [[A10 motorway (Netherlands)|A10 motorway]], railway lines, buses and underground (the Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station). The borders of the neighborhood are to the West the Seineweg, to the North The Basisweg, to the East the A10 motorway and to the South the N200 highway (the ''Haarlemmerweg'').

At this moment around 20,000 are working in the area; in the future it would be around 35,000. The city of Amsterdam has made plans to realize this by designing a new tram and bus station at the ''Carrascoplein''. Other plans include a large plaza around the train station and the development of other types of centers such as schools, cultural and sports facilities, hotels and shops. The street names in the area are derived mostly from international airports around the world: [[Paris-Orly Airport|Orly]]plein, [[Narita International Airport|Narita]]weg, [[Gimpo International Airport|Kimpo]]weg.

The office buildings [[Millennium Tower (Amsterdam)|Millennium Tower]], Crystal Tower, La Guardia Plaza and the building of the ''Belastingdienst'' ([[Tax and Customs Administration]]) are among the highest buildings in the city of Amsterdam.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1948">The '''Texas Enterprise Fund''' is a business incentive fund that was created by legislation in 2003. The fund, which had an initial $295 million investment, is used for ensuring the growth of business in [[Texas]]. One of Texas’ most competitive recruitment tools, these funds are used primarily to attract new business to the state or assist with the substantial expansion of an existing business as part of a competitive recruitment situation. Sources indicate that since 2003 the Fund has yielded up to $6.3 billion in capital investment in Texas by out-of-state companies [https://web.archive.org/web/20081123123323/http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/004974.html].

In 2004, authorization was given for the fund to grant $20 million to [[Countrywide Financial]] in return for a promise "to create 7,500 new jobs in the state by 2010." The grant (all of which are approved by the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor and Speaker of the House) is one of the largest made from the fund in terms of the size and the number of jobs promised. In the fall of 2007, while slashing jobs and with its stock price plummeting, Countrywide was eventually acquired in a [[fire sale]]  by [[Bank of America]]. But thanks to the "claw-back" provisions in the program, grantees return all funds to the state for jobs not created.

In 2012, it was announced that [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] would be adding a new campus in Austin, creating 3,600 new jobs.  The Fund would be investing $21 million over ten years.[http://governor.state.tx.us/news/press-release/17021/]

'''''The Bonfire of the Vanities''''' is a 1990 American [[Satire|satirical]] [[black comedy film]] directed by [[Brian De Palma]]. The screenplay, written by [[Michael Cristofer]], was adapted from the best-selling [[The Bonfire of the Vanities|novel of the same name]] by [[Tom Wolfe]]. The film, which was a critical and commercial flop, stars [[Tom Hanks]], [[Bruce Willis]], [[Melanie Griffith]], and [[Kim Cattrall]]. The original music score was composed by [[Dave Grusin]]. 

The film was a [[box office bomb]], grossing just $15 million against its $47 million budget.&lt;ref name="insider"&gt;{{cite web|first=Gabbi|last=Shaw|url=http://www.thisisinsider.com/movie-flops-over-the-years-2018-2#1978-sextette-1|title=The biggest box office flop from the year you were born|work=Insider |date=February 27, 2017 |accessdate=June 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversies surrounding the film were detailed in a book called ''The Devil's Candy: The Bonfire of the Vanities Goes to Hollywood'' (1991), written by [[Julie Salamon]].

==Plot==
Sherman McCoy is a [[Wall Street]] bond trader who makes millions while enjoying the good life and the sexual favors of Maria Ruskin, a [[Southern belle]] [[Gold digging|gold digger]]. Sherman and Maria are driving back to Maria's apartment from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK Airport]] when they take a wrong turn on the expressway and find themselves in the "war-zone" of the South Bronx. They are approached by two black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire out of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers. The two drive away. Sherman initially wants to report the incident to the police, but Maria immediately talks him out of it, fearing that their affair would be publicly exposed.

Meanwhile, alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow, anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish [[district attorney]] Abe Weiss, who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White, almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the owner of the car, and therefore presumed to be the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City. As Sherman is brought to his knees, New York City fragments into different factions who use the case to suit their own cynical purposes.

Finally, Sherman is left without any allies to support him except for the sympathetic Judge Leonard White and the remorseful Fallow. Fallow gains a tremendous advantage and insight into the case when he is dating a woman who is the sub-letting landlord of Maria's apartment, and knows of secret recordings of conversations in the apartment made by the authorities to prove that the woman is not in fact living in the rent-controlled apartment herself. She discovers information about the McCoy case (where Maria states she was driving the car), which she gives to Fallow, who in turn covertly supplies it to McCoy's defense attorney. Sherman gets his hands on a tape and plays the recording in court, where it reveals Maria directly contradicting the evidence she has just given, showing she has been perjuring herself and causing her to faint. Sherman plays the tape in a tape recorder inside his briefcase connected to a small loudspeaker that he holds on the desk.

When the judge orders that he approach the bench with this evidence, he asserts that the tape is his (making it admissible evidence), resulting in his acquittal. The people in the court go into an uproar, to which Judge White launches into a tirade that they have no right to act self-righteous and smarmy, or that they are above Sherman, considering Reverend Bacon claims to help disadvantaged New Yorkers but actually engages in race baiting, or that the District Attorney Weiss pushed this case not in the interest of justice but in the interest of appealing to minority voters to further his political career by appealing to their desire to "get even". After the Judge made his point, he begs the people to be decent and change their ways, letting Sherman go. A large audience is applauding Peter Fallow's premiere of his book. Fallow says that Sherman McCoy has moved away from New York City to an unknown destination, presumably to live in obscurity.

==Production==

The novel of ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'' was a bestseller. Warner Bros. bought the rights from author Tom Wolfe for $750,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ew.com/article/1991/01/11/bonfire-vanities-business/ Bonfire of the Vanities business] EW.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was plagued by controversy. Among them were the acting choices:
* The role of Peter Fallow was offered to both [[Jack Nicholson]] and [[John Cleese]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rabin|first=Nathan|title=John Cleese|date=5 February 2008|publisher=''[[The A.V. Club]]''|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/john-cleese-14197|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Fallow was English in the novel) by Brian De Palma, but both turned down the role. When De Palma was unable to deliver an actor, the studio forced the director to cast Bruce Willis (who had starred in the successful 1988 film ''[[Die Hard]]'') as Fallow instead.

*When the project was first pitched and [[Mike Nichols]] was the original director, he wanted [[Steve Martin]] for the role of Sherman McCoy (which the studio rejected because they thought Martin was too old for the role).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Steve Martin|date=25 October 2012|publisher=[[Splitsider]]|url=http://splitsider.com/2012/10/the-lost-roles-of-steve-martin/|accessdate=16 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722170625/http://splitsider.com/2012/10/the-lost-roles-of-steve-martin/|archive-date=2015-07-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tom Wolfe wanted [[Chevy Chase]] for McCoy as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of Chevy Chase|date=22 September 2011|publisher=[[Splitsider]]|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/09/the-lost-roles-of-chevy-chase/|accessdate=2 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Walter Matthau]] was initially offered the role of the judge, but demanded a fee of $1 million. The producers balked at meeting his price and signed [[Alan Arkin]] instead for a modest $150,000. Arkin was then replaced by [[Morgan Freeman]] when the studio decided to change the judge's ethnicity from Jewish to African-American in order to moderate criticism of the film's racial politics, and dialogue was added to have the judge denounce the manipulative actions of the main characters. [[Edward James Olmos]] was also considered for the role of the judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6q3dW91a0fgC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=eddie+olmos+the+devil%27s+candy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WGsbQxkfhF&amp;sig=C76izFwbYkG1hrTSbE7q-YLPbUU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=97iZVfmwOYvEggSQ3oaIDA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=eddie%20olmos%20the%20devil's%20candy&amp;f=false|last=Salamon|first=Julie|title=The Devil's Candy: The Anatomy Of A Hollywood Fiasco|year=2002|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=9780786741830}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[F. Murray Abraham]], who had a significant part in the film, chose to not be credited, because of a contract dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099165/trivia|title=The Bonfire of the Vanities|date=21 December 1990|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2016|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was denied the billing above the title that he had requested, he took his name off the picture.&lt;ref&gt;Salamon, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

*Brian De Palma wanted [[Uma Thurman]] to play Maria Ruskin. She even tested for the role. However, Tom Hanks felt she wasn't right for the part and eventually Melanie Griffith was cast instead.&lt;ref&gt;Salamon, p.4-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The studio made significant changes to the source material, making Sherman McCoy more sympathetic and adding a subplot involving a minor character, Judge Leonard White.

In one notable scene in the film, Maria Ruskin ([[Melanie Griffith]]) arrives in New York on an [[Air France]] [[Concorde]].  The film's Second Unit Director, Eric Schwab, calculated the time and day when a runway at JFK would line up exactly with the setting sun, to serve as a backdrop, and managed to film in the single 30-second time period when this occurs in any given year, while winning a bet that he could make the scene an essential part of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20070202/ai_n17205796 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071118121424/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20070202/ai_n17205796 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-11-18 | title='THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES' (1990) | work = The Independent| location = London }} &lt;/ref&gt; The 5-camera shot cost $80,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Devil's Candy |last=Salamon |first=Julie |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Dell |location=New York |isbn=0-385-30824-8 |page=243 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lasted just 10 seconds in the final cut. Schwab also directed the opening title shot &amp;mdash; an almost equally elaborate and expensive set-up requiring a 24-hour timelapse of Manhattan, from a camera platform beside a [[gargoyle]] on top of the [[Chrysler Building]].

Several of the sets parodied the home decorated by [[Robert Denning]] and [[Vincent Fourcade]] for Carolyne Roehm and [[Henry Kravis]].&lt;ref&gt;"Vincent Fourcade - CELEBRATING THE PLEASURES OF MAGNIFICENT EXCESS", by Mitchell Owens, ''[[Architectural Digest]],'' January 2000, v. 57 #1, p. 169 &amp;ndash; one of twenty five persons named by the magazine "Interior Design Legends".&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover of Peter Fallow's book in the film has a similar design to the original first edition of Tom Wolfe's novel from 1987.

Cristofer's original script ended cynically with the supposed victim of the hit-and-run walking out of the hospital, suggesting that the whole scenario was concocted. That ending did not test well with audiences and was dropped.

==Locations==
Sherman and Judy McCoy's luxury apartment was built on the Warner Bros. stage in Burbank, designed by [[Richard Sylbert]].  The Park Avenue exteriors were shot on location late at night, using rain effects and a prop phone box. The lobby scenes were shot at 77 Park Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;Salamon, p.171&lt;/ref&gt;

The courthouse interior scenes were shot at Queens County Courthouse, at night.&lt;ref&gt;Salamon, p.200&lt;/ref&gt; Courthouse exteriors were at the Mario Merola Building / Bronx County Courthouse. The subway entrance was fake &amp;mdash; there is no subway station there. Another courthouse scene showing a riot in slow-motion had been shot at the Essex County Courthouse in Newark but was omitted from the film following negative reaction from test screenings.&lt;ref&gt;Salamon, p.372.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 330-second [[Steadicam]] shot of Peter Fallow arriving at the Palm Court of the [[Winter Garden Atrium|Winter Garden]] was a ''tour de force'' for operator Larry McConkey. He had to track backwards, get on a golf cart, ride it for 380&amp;nbsp;ft, get off it again, track backwards 234&amp;nbsp;ft, get into the elevator, get out again, and track for another 250&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;ref&gt;Salamon, p.223&lt;/ref&gt;

The huge party scenes were shot at the [[Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County|L.A. Natural History Museum]].

==Reception==
The film itself was a critical and commercial flop when it was released. The film cost an estimated US$47 million to make, but initially grossed just over US$15 million at the US box office, making it a huge [[box office bomb]].

Critical reception was fiercely negative. The film scores a 16% "Rotten" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 51 reviews. In [[Leonard Maltin]]'s annual ''[[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide|Movie Guide]]'' publication, the film was given a "BOMB" rating, and described as an "appallingly heavy-handed 'comedy'".

Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "C" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt; {{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its review, ''Variety'' Magazine stated, "the caricatures are so crude and the ‘revelations’ so unenlightening of the human condition, that the satire is about as socially incisive as a [[Police Academy (franchise)|Police Academy]] entry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1989/film/reviews/the-bonfire-of-the-vanities-1200428231/|title=Review: ‘The Bonfire of the Vanities’|first=Variety|last=Staff|date=1 January 1990|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincent Canby]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' denounced "Brian De Palma's gross, unfunny movie adaptation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Vincent|last=Canby |author-link=Vincent Canby |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE7D8153FF932A15751C1A966958260&amp;partner=Rotten%2520Tomatoes |title=A Master of the Universe Brought Down to Earth |date=December 21, 1990| newspaper=[[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called it, "one of the most indecently bad movies of the year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|authorlink=Owen Gleiberman|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1991/01/11/bonfire-vanities|title=The Bonfire of the Vanities|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Meredith Corporation]]|location=New York City|date=January 11, 1991|accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rita Kempley said in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "the director has become one with the buffoons Wolfe scored in his bestseller. He has not only filed Wolfe's teeth but stuck his tail between his legs," and called the film, "A calamity of miscasting and commercial concessions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/thebonfireofthevanitiesrkempley_a0a0c4.htm|title=The Bonfire of the Vanities (R)|first=Rita|last=Kempley|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Peter Travers wrote, "On film, Bonfire achieves a consistency of ineptitude rare even in this era of over-inflated cinematic air bags."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-bonfire-of-the-vanities-19901221|title=The Bonfire of the Vanities|publisher=|accessdate=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] wrote in ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'', "preview audiences have hooted the film`s revisionist ending, which concludes with a sermon. I didn`t hoot because I was too sad. I gave up on the movie well before the ending."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Gene |last=Siskel |author-link=Gene Siskel |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-12-21/entertainment/9004150626_1_vanities-wall-street-brian-de-palma |title=De Palma's Direction Takes Fire Out Of 'Vanities' |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=December 21, 1990 |access-date=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her review for ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', Sheila Benson called the film, "an overstated, cartooned film for dullards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sheila|last=Benson|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-21/entertainment/ca-6868_1_movie-review|title=MOVIE REVIEW :  De Palma Damps the 'Bonfire' :  Movies: A rich novel is turned into an overstated, cartooned film for dullards.|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=December 21, 1990|accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Rea wrote in ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', "Big books have been bastardized by Hollywood before - it's a time-honored tradition that counts [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]], [[William Faulkner|Faulkner]] and the scribes of the [[Old Testament]] among its victims - but you'd be hard-pressed to find an adaptation that screws up as royally as Brian De Palma's take on ''The Bonfire of the Vanities''.  Miscast, misguided and miserably unfunny, Tom Wolfe's black satire about avarice, prejudice and criminal injustice in the loony-toon town of New York has been raped, stripped of all ambiguity and dimension," and he ended the review by saying, "What a mess."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven|last=Rea|url=http://articles.philly.com/1990-12-21/entertainment/25923540_1_tom-wolfe-vanities-mccoy|title='Bonfire Of Vanities' Has Wolfe's Characters But Not His Tart Satire|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=[[McClatchy]]|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|date=December 21, 1990|accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the way Tom Wolfe's story was adapted, [[Brian De Palma]] said, "The initial concept of it was incorrect. If you're going to do ''The Bonfire of the Vanities'', you would have to make it a lot darker and more cynical, but because it was such an expensive movie we tried to humanize the Sherman McCoy character – a very unlikeable character, much like the character in ''[[The Magnificent Ambersons]]''. We could have done that if we'd been making a low-budget movie, but this was a studio movie with Tom Hanks in it. We made a couple of choices that in retrospect were wrong. I think [[John Lithgow]] would have been a better choice for Sherman McCoy, because he would have got the [[Nobility#"Blue" blood|blue-blood]] arrogance of the character."&lt;ref name="autogenerated94"/&gt;

De Palma has, however, been quick to downplay the notion that the movie suffered because of studio interference: "The initial producers, once we had cast Tom Hanks, moved on and went over to [[Columbia Pictures]], so I was sort of left to my own devices and pursued ways in which I thought I could make this movie more commercial and keep some edge of the book...I thought we were going to get away with it, but we didn't. I knew that the people who read the book were going to be extremely unhappy, and I said, 'Well, this is a movie; it isn't the book.' And I think if you look at the movie now, and you don't know anything about the book, and you get it out of the time that it was released, I think you can see it in a whole different way."&lt;ref name="autogenerated94"/&gt;

In the countries of the former [[Yugoslavia]], it has been aired on various TV stations dozens of times and is still regularly aired each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mojtv.hr/film/5818/vatromet-tastine.aspx |title=Vatromet taštine (Bonfire of the vanities) - Film - MojTV |publisher=Mojtv.hr |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sat-planet.net/showthread.php?t=4765&amp;page=5 |title=Forum Gateway - Powered by DnP Firewall |publisher=Sat-planet.net |date=2012-12-21 |accessdate=2013-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307075834/http://www.sat-planet.net/showthread.php?t=4765&amp;page=5 |archivedate=2014-03-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Devil's Candy''==
The controversies surrounding the film were detailed in a book called ''The Devil's Candy: The Bonfire of the Vanities Goes to Hollywood'' (1991), written by Julie Salamon. Salamon was the film critic for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' and wanted to write a book about the adaptation of the novel. She was granted much access to the filming of ''Bonfire''.

Among other things, the book describes how Brian de Palma had a difficult relationship with then-rising-star Bruce Willis who, in the words of Julie Salamon, "was generally disliked by most of the cast and crew [due to his ego]." In one instance, during the filming of a scene in which Willis was with Alan King (the scene in which the character played by King dies), Willis challenged the crew to make the whole scene move along faster, allegedly because it was very hot on the set.

Although Willis was called out of the set by de Palma to discuss the incident, this particular scene ended up being considerably shorter and simpler than originally intended. Brian De Palma described ''The Devil's Candy'' as "a very good book. I let [[Julie Salamon]] see everything. She portrayed it all very accurately. But I mean, nobody realized it was going wrong when we were making it. We were very enthusiastic about what we were doing."&lt;ref name="autogenerated94"&gt;Brian De Palma interviewed in ''Empire'' magazine #93, December 2008, p.94&lt;/ref&gt; Salamon's book was re-released in 2002 with a revised title, ''The Devil's Candy: The Anatomy of a Hollywood Fiasco'', and further material by Salamon (in which she describes Bruce Willis's negative reaction to the book).

'''''The Harvest''''' ({{lang-es|La Cosecha}}) is a 2010 [[documentary film]] about [[Agriculture|agricultural]] [[child labour|child labor]] in [[United States|America]]. The film depicts children as young as 12 years of age who work as many as 12 hours a day, six months a year, subject to hazardous conditions: [[Hyperthermia|heat exposure]], [[pesticide]]s, and dangerous work.  The agriculture industry has been subject to significantly more lenient [[labour law|labor laws]] than any other occupation in the [[United States]].  As a result, lack of consistent schooling significantly limits their opportunities of succeeding in high school or more.  The hazardous conditions threaten their health and lives.  The purpose of the documentary is to bring awareness of the harsh working conditions which tens of thousands of children face in the fields of the United States each year and to enact the [[Children's Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act)|Children's Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act, HR 3564)]] which will bring parity of labor conditions to field workers that are afforded to minors in other occupations.

==Background==
The [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] (FLSA) has different standards for children working in [[agriculture]] than in any other industry.  The Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs estimates that there are between 400,000 and 500,000 children working in the farming industry.  Children as young as 12 years of age work in the fields.  There is no minimum number of hours worked a day, aside from being outside school hours.  They are exposed to the sun, harmful [[pesticide]]s and hazardous conditions.  Children are in up to three times greater danger of exposure to pesticides than adults due to their size and stage of development.  The fatality rate is six times that in any other industry: children account for 20% of all deaths on farms.  Although agriculture is a hazardous occupation, no statistics are maintained on child laborers and serious accidents.&lt;ref name=AFOP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afop.org/children-in-the-fields/learn-the-facts/ |title=Learn the Facts |year=2011 |work=Children in the Fields |publisher=Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who work on farms or in fields spend on average 30 hours a week, even during times of the year when school is in session.  Of the children who work on farms, 50% of them will not graduate from high school.&lt;ref name=AFOP/&gt;  The [[United States Department of Labor]] estimates that children earn about $1,000 in one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afop.org/about/2011-year-of-the-farmworker-child/ |title=2011 Year of the Farmworker Child |year=2011 |work=Children in the Fields |publisher=Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''The Harvest'' is a feature [[documentary film]] on the life of [[Migrant worker|migrant]] children and their families in the [[United States]].  It revisits [[Edward R. Murrow]]’s ''[[Harvest of Shame]]'', filmed 53 years ago, and reveals that little has changed over the past five decades in the lives of migrant farm workers in the United States. ''The Harvest'', however, is told from a child's perspective as it presents four of the more than 400,000 children between the ages of 5 and 16 who labor in fields and factories, lacking the protections offered by the Fair Labor Standards Act that all other American children enjoy.&lt;ref name="Shine Global Inc."&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.shineglobal.org/?page_id=19 | title=The Harvest/La Cosecha, The Story of the Children Who Feed America | publisher=Shine Global | year=2010 | accessdate=2011-05-27 |archivedate=2011-01-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104234610/http://www.shineglobal.org/index.php/hero-of-the-week/harvest/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film profiles several children and their families as they work through the 2009 - 2010 harvest seasons, facing  risks of being separated, deported or death.  A twelve-year-old girl, Zulema L., works in a field of strawberries. One of her earliest memories is being taught by her mother to pick and clean strawberries.  Zulema struggles academically because of the family's seasonal movement. She has attended eight different schools in eight years. Not confident that she will make it to high school, she has no dreams about what her future could hold.  The documentary tracks other children with their own stories of living a life of a [[child labour|child laborer]].&lt;ref name="Shine Global Inc."/&gt;

Work began on the documentary in June 2007 and through the 2009 - 2010 harvests.  In that time the project has followed harvests in [[Minnesota]], [[North Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[North Carolina]] and [[Ohio]]. The documentary was shot with cinematic scope. Post-production began in early winter 2010, with the completion of the film in fall 2010.&lt;ref name="Shine Global Inc."/&gt;

''The Harvest'' was produced by [[Shine Global]] in association with Globalvision, Romano Film and Photography, and [[Eva Longoria]]'s UnbeliEVAble Productions.  Longoria signed on as an executive producer of the project in 2009.&lt;ref name="broadcastingcable.com"&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/189904-Eva_Longoria_Parker_to_Executive_Produce_Child_Farm_Worker_Documentary.php | title=Eva Longoria Parker to Executive Produce Child Farm Worker Documentary | author=Tanklefsky, D | date=Mar 13, 2009  | publisher=Bay Media, LLC | accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by [[Robin Romano|U.

==CARE legislation==
[[Eva Longoria]], director [[U. Roberto Romano]], and associate director Julia Perez visited [[Capitol Hill]] to mark the anniversary of [[Members of Congress|Representative]] [[Lucille Roybal-Allard|Lucille Roybal-Allard’s]] introduction of the CARE Act [[legislation]] in September 2009.  The [[Children's Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act)|Children’s Act for Responsible Employment (CARE Act, HR 3564)]] addresses the harshest conditions that tens of thousands of children as young as 12 years of age may be subject to, such as restrictions in the number of hours that children work in a day.  The intention of the [[bill (proposed law)|bill]] is to raise the standard for children working in agriculture to that of any other occupation in the United States.  As of September 1, 2010 the bill had 103 [[Sponsor (legislative)|co-sponsors]].  While on Capitol Hill, Longoria and Romano showed scenes from the feature-length documentary to illustrate the harsh working conditions and exploitation of children in the fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://roybal-allard.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=206669 |title=Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard, Press Release |date=Sep 15, 2010 |publisher=Offices of Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A trailer of the film was first privately screened at a [[United States Department of Labor]] panel discussion, hosted by [[United States Secretary of Labor|Secretary of Labor]] [[Hilda Solis]] and including [[Dolores Huerta]] of the [[United Farm Workers]], filmmaker Robin Romano, Mark Lara from the Department of Labor's [[Wage and Hour Division]], and other experts.

'''Thomas Clarke''' [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] (1846 – 28 December 1922) was an Australian politician and businessman who served several terms as Mayor of [[Redfern, New South Wales|Redfern]].

==Early life==
Clark was born to a [[Methodist]] family in 1846 in [[County Fermanagh]], Ireland, and emigrated to the Colony of [[New South Wales]] in 1861. He commenced business as a commercial agent and produce merchant in Sydney and entered politics when he was elected as an [[Alderman]] on the first [[Broughton Vale, New South Wales|Broughton Vale]] [[City of Shoalhaven|Municipal Council]] on 19 June 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Municipality of Broughton's Vale|url=http://api.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/2078|website=NSW State Records|publisher=NSW Government|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article71484758 |title=The Produce Trade of Sydney.—Some Views of Sussex=street. |newspaper=[[Australian Town and Country Journal]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=12 August 1903 |accessdate=31 January 2016 |page=27 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke was first elected to serve on [[Municipality of Redfern|Redfern Municipal Council]] in February 1887 for Golden Grove Ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13626208 |title=THE MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=NSW |date=2 February 1887 |accessdate=31 January 2016 |page=10 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rose to become mayor on two occasions, from February 1890 to February 1891 and from October 1898 to February 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13759678 |title=MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |location=NSW |date=15 February 1890 |accessdate=31 January 2016 |page=9 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article114045677 |title=RESIGNATION OF THE MAYOR OF REDFERN. |newspaper=Evening News|location=Sydney, NSW |date=14 October 1898 |accessdate=31 January 2016 |page=3 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article117031233 |title=BREVITIES. |newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|Evening News]] |location=Sydney, NSW |date=8 February 1900 |accessdate=31 January 2016 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and career==
Clarke first stood for the NSW Parliament at the [[New South Wales state election, 1895|1895]] election as a [[Free Trade Party|Free Trade]] candidate for [[Electoral district of Darlington|Darlington]], but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Antony|title=NSW Elections - 1895 Results - Redfern|url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1895/Darlington.htm|website=NSW Elections database|publisher=Parliament of New South Wales|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eventually elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] for Darlington in [[New South Wales state election, 1898|1898]] as a Free Trader, and sat after federation as a member of the [[Liberal Reform Party (Australia)|Liberal Reform Party]]. However he was defeated at the following election in [[New South Wales state election, 1901|1901]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14393457 |title=DARLINGTON ELECTORATE. |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=NSW |date=26 June 1901 |accessdate=31 January 2016 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nsw&gt;{{cite web| title = Mr Thomas Clarke (1922)| work = Former Members| publisher = [[Parliament of New South Wales]]| year = 2008| url = http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/members.nsf/1fb6ebed995667c2ca256ea100825164/2373d5d9fda04703ca256cbd00834306?OpenDocument| accessdate = 7 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke continued to serve on Redfern Council until his retirement in February 1906.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article14724290 |title=MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS. |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|location=NSW |date=29 December 1905 |accessdate=31 January 2016 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; For thirty-five years, Clarke operated as a commission agent on [[Sussex Street, Sydney]], but retired owing to ill health a few years before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16037914 |title=THE LATE MR.

'''WCFO''', known on air as "News/Talk 1160", is a [[Talk radio|news and talk radio]] station, licensed to [[East Point, Georgia]], serving the [[Atlanta, Georgia]] radio market.

==Programming==
Programming on WCFO includes both nationally syndicated and locally produced news, information, and [[talk radio|talk]] programs. [[Westwood One News]] News is carried at the top of most hours. WCFO broadcasts with a power of 50,000 [[watt]]s during the day with a directional antenna pattern using a four tower antenna array, and 160 watts of power at night using one antenna tower in an omnidirectional antenna pattern.

The sister station to WCFO is [[WMLB]], owned by JW Broadcasting. Prior to becoming WCFO in June 2006, the 1160 [[kHz]] facility was the home of WMLB. WWAA was sold to the owner of WMLB, JW Broadcasting, in 2006. The owner, JW Broadcasting, decided to move the WMLB call signs and format from 1160&amp;nbsp;kHz to the 1690&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency in order to increase WMLB's coverage area. The facility at 1160&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency was assigned the WCFO call sign and adopted the [[Talk radio|business talk radio]] format in June 2006.&lt;ref name="cl"&gt;{{cite news|title=Future uncertain for Air America's Atlanta affiliate|author = Abkowitz, Alyssa|date=2006-05-10 |accessdate=2007-12-11|publisher = [[Creative Loafing]] ([[Atlanta, Georgia]])|url=http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=72926}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1, 2008, WCFO switched to a [[news radio|news]]/[[talk radio|talk]] format.&lt;ref name="al"&gt;{{cite news|title=3/20: 1160/WCFO-AM drops business talk for Mancow, Dr. Laura, Phil Hendrie, Lou Dobbs|author = Ho, Rodney|date=2008-03-20 |accessdate=2008-04-10|publisher = [[Atlanta Journal Constitution]] ([[Atlanta, Georgia]])|url=http://www.accessatlanta.com/blogs/content/shared-blogs/accessatlanta/radiotalk/entries/2008/03/20/320_1160wcfoam.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2009, it was announced that [[Don Imus]]'s syndicated radio program, ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'', would move from [[WYAY]] (owned by the show's syndicator, [[Citadel Broadcasting]]) to WCFO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boards.radio-info.com/smf/index.php/topic,124180.0.html Radio-Info: "Spiff and Fred to Mornings at True Oldies 106.7, Imus to WCFO 1160", 4/6/2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, 2010 Georgia State athletics &amp; Newstalk 1160 "The Talk of the Town" reached an agreement to serve as the official flagship radio station for [[Georgia State University|Georgia State's]] inaugural [[College football|football]] season. The station will also serve as the radio home for [[College basketball|Panther]] and men's basketball.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pr.com/press-release/227310&lt;/ref&gt;

At some point, WCFO Started airing Clemson Tigers Football from the [[Clemson Tigers Sports Network]]

==History of the 1160 frequency==
WERD was playing classic [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] when on July 4, 1995, new program director Mitch Faulkner started playing [[rap music]] at night and hired younger DJs.&lt;ref&gt;"Peach Buzz: Acting Up for a Good Cause," ''The Atlanta Constitution'', June 19, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Brown]] soon put an end to the rap because he did not like it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vox Jox|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=September 9, 1995|volume=107|issue=38|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 1996, WERD ended its rhythm and blues format and joined the [[Prime Sports Network]] with a [[sports talk]] format. The station went off the air in 1997. Atlanta businessman Darrell Spann and Atlanta Area Broadcasting returned the station to the air in July 1998 as WKGE with a [[classic country]] format.

On  April 2, 2001, Billy Corey bought WMLB (1170 AM) in [[Cumming, Georgia]] and changed its format, and that of WKGE, to [[oldies]]—specifically oldies that had not been heard on other stations.&lt;ref name=mleach&gt;http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~mleach/radio/am.html, Retrieved on 2008/09/25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The change at WMLB did not make listeners happy. In 1995, WMLB changed from [[country music]] to [[Americana (music)|Americana]], and, although it did not reach all of Atlanta with its 5000-watt signal, it was the only station of its type in the area. The format included familiar names such as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Tom Petty]], as well as less mainstream artists such as [[John Prine]], [[Guy Clark]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Townes Van Zandt]], [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], [[Son Volt]], [[Wilco]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Jerry Garcia]], and the Atlanta band The [[Vidalias]]. WMLB program director Chris Marino won Americana program director of the year from The [[Gavin Report]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Russ DeVault, "'Americana' Format at Home in Cumming," ''The Atlanta Constitution'', June 12, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Townsend, "A Who's Who of Newer Groups," ''The Atlanta Constitution'', November 8, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Longino, "Atlanta Upstarts Capture Top National Awards," ''The Atlanta Constitution'', February 19, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

WKGE and WMLB became "The Twins: Classic 1160 and Classic 1170." WKGE planned to increase its 10,000-watt signal to 50,000 watts. The playlist included "[[Palisades Park (Freddy Cannon song)|Palisades Park]]" by [[Freddy Cannon]], "[[Galveston (song)|Galveston]]" by [[Glen Campbell]], "[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]" by [[The Big Bopper]], "[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)#Theme music|Hawaii Five-O]]" by [[The Ventures]], "Suspicion" by [[Terry Stafford]], "Little GTO" by [[Ronny &amp; the Daytonas]], and "Yes I'm Ready" by [[Barbara Mason]]. The music collection included 9000 songs, including some by [[The Tams]] with their original lineup. General manager Ron McCarter, described as "a voracious record collector," said Americana was "not commercially viable" but also said it was "a great format." WMLB fans wished the pairing of the two stations had resulted in Americana covering the entire area.&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Longino, "Americana Fans Feeling So Blue: Radioactive: Surfing Soundwaves, Online and Off," ''The Atlanta Constitution'', April 8, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

The power boost by 1160 AM (not including the limited nighttime signal), which became WMLB, involved moving the tower from [[East Point, Georgia|East Point]] to [[Austell, Georgia|Austell]]. By 2003, when the change took effect, the stations' format was [[adult standards]] from local DJs in the morning and afternoon and the [[Music of Your Life]] network at other times, with such artists as [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Tony Bennett]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Norah Jones]], and [[Diana Krall]].&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Gubrecht, "Watts Up: Station Gets a Power Boost," ''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', June 14, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1170 frequency left the air in 2003.&lt;ref name=mleach/&gt;

By 2005, WMLB had what was described as an "eclectic" format.&lt;ref&gt;"Scene: Radio Round-Up," ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', September 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
