Abramov in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramov|first=Sergei A.|date=1989|title=Rational solutions of linear differential and difference equations with polynomial coefficients|journal=USSR Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics|volume=29|issue=6|pages=7–12|doi=10.1016/s0041-5553(89)80002-3|issn=0041-5553|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abramov|first=Sergei A.|date=1995|title=Rational solutions of linear difference and q-difference equations with polynomial coefficients|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=220346.220383|journal=ISSAC '95 Proceedings of the 1995 International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation|volume=|pages=285–289|doi=10.1145/220346.220383|isbn=978-0897916998|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Universal denominator ==
The main concept in Abramov's algorithm is a universal denominator. Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbb{K}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] zero. The ''dispersion'' &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\operatorname{dis} (p,q)&lt;/math&gt; of two polynomials &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p, q \in \mathbb{K}[n]&lt;/math&gt; is defined as&lt;math display="block"&gt;\operatorname{dis} (p,q) =\max \{ k \in \N \, : \, \deg (\gcd (p(n), q(n+k) )) \geq 1 \} \cup \{ -1 \},&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\N&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of non-negative integers. Therefore the dispersion is the maximum &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k \in \N&lt;/math&gt; such that the polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; and the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-times shifted polynomial &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; have a common factor. It is &lt;math display="inline"&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; if such a &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; does not exist. The dispersion can be computed as the largest non-negative integer root of the [[resultant]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\operatorname{res}_n (p(n), q(n+k) ) \in \mathbb{K}[k]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Man|first=Yiu-Kwong|last2=Wright|first2=Francis J.|date=1994|title=Fast polynomial dispersion computation and its application to indefinite summation|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=190347.190413|journal=ISSAC '94 Proceedings of the International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation|volume=|pages=175–180|doi=10.1145/190347.190413|isbn=978-0897916387|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerhard|first=Jürgen|date=2005|title=Modular Algorithms in Symbolic Summation and Symbolic Integration|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/b104035|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=3218|language=en-gb|doi=10.1007/b104035|issn=0302-9743|isbn=978-3-540-24061-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum_{k=0}^r p_k(n) \, y (n+k) = f(n)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[P-recursive equation|recurrence equation]] of order &lt;math display="inline"&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; with polynomial coefficients &lt;math&gt;p_k \in \mathbb{K} [n]&lt;/math&gt;, polynomial right-hand side &lt;math display="inline"&gt;f \in \mathbb{K}[n]&lt;/math&gt; and rational sequence solution  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y (n) \in \mathbb{K}(n)&lt;/math&gt;. It is possible to write &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y (n) = p(n)/q(n)&lt;/math&gt; for two relatively prime polynomials &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p, q \in \mathbb{K}[n]&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math display="inline"&gt;D=\operatorname{dis} (p_r(n-r), p_0 (n) )&lt;/math&gt; and&lt;math display="block"&gt;u(n) = \gcd ([p_0 (n+D)]^{\underline{D+1}}, [p_r (n-r)]^{\underline{D+1}})&lt;/math&gt;where &lt;math display="inline"&gt;[p(n)]^{\underline{k}}=p(n)p(n-1)\cdots p(n-k+1)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[Falling and rising factorials|falling factorial]] of a function. Then &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q(n)&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math display="inline"&gt;u(n)&lt;/math&gt;. So the polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt;u(n)&lt;/math&gt; can be used as a denominator for all rational solutions &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y(n)&lt;/math&gt; and hence it is called a universal denominator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Chen|first=William Y.

== Algorithm ==

Let again &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\sum_{k=0}^r p_k(n) \, y (n+k) = f(n)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[P-recursive equation|recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients]] and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;u(n)&lt;/math&gt; a universal denominator. After substituting &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y (n) = z(n)/u(n)&lt;/math&gt; for an unknown polynomial &lt;math display="inline"&gt;z(n) \in \mathbb{K} [n]&lt;/math&gt; and setting &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell(n) = \operatorname{lcm}(u(n), \dots, u(n+r))&lt;/math&gt; the recurrence equation is equivalent to&lt;math display="block"&gt;\sum_{k=0}^r p_k (n) \frac{z(n+k)}{u(n+k)} \ell(n) = f(n) \ell(n).&lt;/math&gt;As the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;u(n+k)&lt;/math&gt; cancel this is a linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients which can be solved for an unknown polynomial solution &lt;math display="inline"&gt;z(n)&lt;/math&gt;. There are [[Polynomial solutions of P-recursive equations|algorithms to find polynomial solutions]]. The solutions for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;z(n)&lt;/math&gt; can then be used again to compute the rational solutions &lt;math display="inline"&gt;y(n) = z(n)/u(n)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Example ==

The homogeneous recurrence equation of order &lt;math display="inline"&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math display="block"&gt;(n-1) \, y(n) + (-n-1) \, y(n+1) = 0&lt;/math&gt;over &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\Q&lt;/math&gt; has a rational solution. It can be computed by considering the dispersion&lt;math display="block"&gt;D = \operatorname{dis} (p_1 (n-1), p_0 (n) ) = \operatorname{disp} (-n,n-1) = 1.&lt;/math&gt;This yields the following universal denominator:&lt;math display="block"&gt; u(n) = \gcd ([p_0 (n+1)]^{\underline{2}}, [p_r (n-1)]^{\underline{2}}) = (n-1)n&lt;/math&gt;and&lt;math display="block"&gt; \ell(n) = \operatorname{lcm} (u(n), u(n+1) ) = (n-1)n(n+1).&lt;/math&gt;Multiplying the original recurrence equation with &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \ell(n)&lt;/math&gt; and substituting &lt;math display="inline"&gt; y(n) = z(n)/u(n)&lt;/math&gt; leads to&lt;math display="block"&gt; (n-1)(n+1)\, z(n) + (-n-1) (n-1) \, z(n+1) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;This equation has the polynomial solution &lt;math display="inline"&gt; z(n) = c&lt;/math&gt; for an arbitrary constant &lt;math display="inline"&gt; c \in \Q&lt;/math&gt;. Using &lt;math display="inline"&gt; y(n) = z(n) / u(n)&lt;/math&gt; the general rational solution is&lt;math display="block"&gt; y(n) = \frac{c}{(n-1)n}&lt;/math&gt;for arbitrary &lt;math display="inline"&gt; c \in \Q&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Malcolm X any means necessary.jpg|thumb|This poster, based on a famous photograph from ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', popularized the slogan.]]

'''By any means necessary''' is a translation of a phrase used by French intellectual [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] in his play ''[[Dirty Hands]]''. It entered the popular [[civil rights]] culture through a speech given by [[Malcolm X]] at the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]] founding rally on June 28, 1964. It is generally considered to leave open all available tactics for the desired ends, including [[violence]]; however, the “necessary” qualifier adds a caveat—if violence is not necessary, then presumably, it should not be used.

== Jean-Paul Sartre ==

The phrase is translation of a sentence used in French intellectual Jean-Paul Sartre's play ''Dirty Hands'':

{{quote
| text = I was not the one to invent lies: they were created in a [[society]] divided by [[Social class|class]] and each of us inherited lies when we were born. It is not by refusing to lie that we will abolish lies: it is by eradicating class ''by any means necessary''.
| sign = Jean-Paul Sartre
| source = ''Dirty Hands'': act 5, scene 3. 1963&lt;ref name="Bartleby" /&gt;
}}

== Malcolm X ==

It entered the popular culture through a speech given by Malcolm X in the last year of his life.
{{quote
| text = We declare our right on this earth to be a man, to be a human being, to be respected as a human being, to be given the rights of a human being in this society, on this earth, in this day, which we intend to bring into existence ''by any means necessary''.
| sign = Malcolm X
| source = 1965&lt;ref name="Malcolm X 1992" /&gt;
}}

=== Mandela case ===

In the final scene of the 1992 movie ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm X]]'', [[Nelson Mandela]]—recently released after 27&amp;nbsp;years of political imprisonment—appears as a schoolteacher in a [[Soweto]] classroom.&lt;ref name="Cunningham 2004-06-03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero 1993" /&gt; Yet Mandela informed director [[Spike Lee]] that he could not utter the famous final phrase ''"by any means necessary"'' on camera; fearing that the [[apartheid]] government would use it against him if he did. Lee obliged, and the final seconds of the film feature black-and-white footage of Malcolm X himself delivering the phrase.&lt;ref name="Guerrero 1993" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13556">[[File:KarottenZwiebeln 266.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Companion planting of carrots and onions]]

'''Companion planting''' in gardening and agriculture is the planting of different crops in proximity for any of a number of different reasons, including  [[pest control]], [[pollination]], providing [[habitat]] for beneficial creatures, maximizing use of space, and to otherwise increase [[crop productivity]].&lt;ref name="mcclure"&gt;{{cite book |last=McClure |first=Susan |year=1994 |title=Companion Planting |publisher=Rodale Press |isbn=978-0-87596-616-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companion planting is a form of [[polyculture]].

Companion planting is used by farmers and gardeners in both industrialized and developing countries for many reasons. Many of the modern principles of companion planting were present many centuries ago in [[cottage garden]]s in England and [[forest garden]]s in Asia, and thousands of years ago in [[Mesoamerica]].

==History==
In China, [[Azolla|mosquito ferns]] (''Azolla'' spp.) have been used for at least a thousand years as companion plants for [[rice]] crops. They host a [[Cyanobacteria|cyanobacterium]] that fixes nitrogen from the atmosphere, and they block light from plants that would compete with the rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dhakai.com/botany/Keynote%20paper.pdf|title=Plant Resources for Human Development-Nitrogen in Rice|publisher=Dhakai.com|format=PDF|accessdate=February 21, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304231916/http://www.dhakai.com/botany/Keynote%20paper.pdf|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companion planting was practiced in various forms by the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] prior to the arrival of Europeans.

Companion planting was widely promoted in the 1970s as part of the [[Organic horticulture|organic gardening]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Companion Planting Guide |url=https://wheelbarrowexpert.com/companion-planting-guide/ |website=Mel's Garden |accessdate=12 July 2018|date=2018-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was encouraged for pragmatic reasons, such as natural [[Trellis (architecture)|trellising]], but mainly with the idea that [[List of companion plants|different species of plant]] may thrive more when close together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=7 Reasons For Companion Planting |url=http://www.gardenandgreenhouse.net/articles/september-2017/7-reasons-companion-planting/ |website=Garden &amp; Greenhouse |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a technique frequently used in [[permaculture]], together with [[mulch]]ing, [[polyculture]], and [[intercropping|changing of crops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Companion Planting Guide |url=https://wheelbarrowexpert.com/companion-planting-guide/ |website=Mel's Garden |accessdate=12 July 2018|date=2018-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

[[Nasturtium (popular name)|Nasturtium]] (''Tropaeolum majus'') is a food plant of some [[caterpillar]]s which feed primarily on members of the [[Brassicaceae|cabbage family]] (brassicas),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.rhs.org.uk/advicesearch/profile.aspx?pid=457|publisher=Royal Horticultural Society|title=Cabbage caterpillars|accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some gardeners claim that planting them around brassicas protects the food crops from damage, as eggs of the pests are preferentially laid on the nasturtium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pleasant|first1=Barbara|title=ORGANIC PEST CONTROL WHAT WORKS, WHAT DOESN'T.|journal=Mother Earth News|date=June–July 2011|issue=246|page=36–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; This practice is called [[trap crop]]ping (using alternative plants to attract pests away from a main crop). However, while many trap crops have successfully diverted pests off of focal crops in small scale greenhouse, garden and field experiments, only a small portion of these plants have been shown to reduce pest damage at larger commercial scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Ellner|first2=Stephen P.|last3=Lee|first3=Doo-Hyung|last4=Nyrop|first4=Jan P.|last5=Sanderson|first5=John P.|date=2012-06-01|title=Designing an effective trap cropping strategy: the effects of attraction, retention and plant spatial distribution|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=49|issue=3|pages=715–722|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2012.02137.x|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smell of the foliage of [[Tagetes|marigold]]s is claimed to deter [[aphid]]s from feeding on neighbouring crops. Marigolds with simple flowers also attract nectar-feeding adult [[Hoverfly|hoverflies]], the larvae of which are predators of aphids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/pest-control/hoverflies-organic-aphid-control-zw0z1301zkin|title=Attract Hoverflies for Organic Aphid Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Various [[legume]] crops benefit from being commingled with a grassy [[nurse crop]]. For example, [[common vetch]] or [[hairy vetch]] is planted together with [[rye]] or [[winter wheat]] to make a good [[cover crop]] or [[green manure]] (or both).

The terms "undersowing" and "overseeding" both involve [[intercropping]] as a type of companion planting. "Undersowing" conveys the idea of sowing the second crop among the young plants of the first crop (or in between the rows, if rows are used). A connotation of [[understory]] growth is conveyed, albeit exaggerated (because the first crop is not yet a dense [[canopy (biology)|canopy]]). "Overseeding" conveys the idea of broadcasting the seeds of the second crop over the existing first crop. This is analogous to overseeding a lawn to improve the mix of grasses present.

==Versions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}
There are a number of systems and ideas using companion planting.

[[Square foot gardening]] attempts to protect plants from many normal gardening problems, such as weed infestation, by packing them as closely together as possible, which is facilitated by using companion plants, which can be closer together than normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bartholomew |first1=Mel |title=All New Square Foot Gardening |date=2013 |publisher=Cool Springs Press |isbn=978-1591865483 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another system using companion planting is the [[Forest gardening|forest garden]], where companion plants are intermingled to create an actual ecosystem, emulating the interaction of up to seven levels of plants in a forest or [[woodland]].

[[Organic horticulture|Organic gardening]] may make use of companion planting, since many synthetic means of fertilizing, weed reduction and pest control are forbidden.

===Host-finding disruption===
Recent studies on host-plant finding have shown that flying pests are far less successful if their host-plants are surrounded by any other plant or even "decoy-plants" made of green plastic, cardboard, or any other green material.

The host-plant finding process occurs in phases:
* The first phase is stimulation by odours characteristic to the host-plant. This induces the insect to try to land on the plant it seeks. But insects avoid landing on brown (bare) soil. So if only the host-plant is present, the insects will quasi-systematically find it by simply landing on the only green thing around. This is called (from the point of view of the insect) "appropriate landing". When it does an "inappropriate landing", it flies off to any other nearby patch of green. It eventually leaves the area if there are too many 'inappropriate' landings.
* The second phase of host-plant finding is for the insect to make short flights from leaf to leaf to assess the plant's overall suitability. The number of leaf-to-leaf flights varies according to the insect species and to the host-plant stimulus received from each leaf. The insect must accumulate sufficient stimuli from the host-plant to lay eggs; so it must make a certain number of consecutive 'appropriate' landings. Hence if it makes an 'inappropriate landing', the assessment of that plant is negative, and the insect must start the process anew.

Thus it was shown that [[clover]] used as a ground cover had the same disruptive effect on eight pest species from four different insect orders. An experiment showed that 36% of cabbage root flies laid eggs beside cabbages growing in bare soil (which resulted in no crop), compared to only 7% beside cabbages growing in clover (which allowed a good crop). Simple decoys made of green cardboard also disrupted appropriate landings just as well as did the live ground cover.&lt;ref name="warwick"/&gt;

==Companion plant categories==
The use of companion planting can be of benefit to the grower in a number of different ways, including:
* '''Hedged investment'''{{spaced ndash}} the growing of different crops in the same space increases the odds of some yield being given, even if one crop fails.
* '''Increased level interaction'''{{spaced ndash}} when crops are grown on different levels in the same space, such as providing ground cover or one crop working as a trellis for another, the overall yield of a plot may be increased. 
* '''Protective shelter''' is when one type of plant may serve as a [[wind break]] or provide shade for another.
* '''Pest suppression'''{{spaced ndash}} some companion plants may help prevent pest insects or pathogenic [[fungi]] from damaging the crop, through chemical means.&lt;ref name="theselfsufficientgardener1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theselfsufficientgardener.com/episode-24-companion-planting-and-crop-rotation/| title=The Self-Sufficient Gardener Podcast--Episode 24 Companion Planting and Crop Rotation|date=|accessdate= 2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Predator recruitment''' and '''positive hosting'''{{spaced ndash}} The use of companion plants that produce copious nectar or [[pollen]] in a vegetable garden ([[insectary plants]]) may help encourage higher populations of beneficial insects that control pests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/dept/nurspest/Insectary_plants.htm|title=Pacific Northwest Nursery IPM. Flowers, Sweets and a Nice Place to Stay: Courting Beneficials to Your Nursery|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some beneficial predatory insects only consume pests in their larval form and are nectar or pollen feeders in their adult form.
* '''[[Trap crop]]ping'''{{spaced ndash}} some companion plants are claimed to attract pests away from others.
* '''Pattern disruption'''{{spaced ndash}} in a [[monoculture]] pests spread easily from one crop plant to the next, whereas such easy progress may be disrupted by surrounding companion plants of a different type.&lt;ref name="warwick"&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/wcc/research/pests/companionplanting/biologist_jun03.pdf Horticulture Research International, Wellesbourne : "Insects can see clearly now the weeds have gone".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46814">A '''DNA database''' or '''DNA databank''' is a [[database]] of [[DNA profiling|DNA profile]]s which can be used in the analysis of [[genetic disease]]s, [[genetic fingerprinting]] for [[criminology]], or [[genetic genealogy]].  DNA databases may be public or private, the largest ones being [[national DNA database]]s.

When a match is made from a national DNA database to link a crime scene to a person whose DNA profile is stored on a database, that link is often referred to as a ''cold hit''.  A cold hit is of particular value in linking a specific person to a crime scene, but is of less evidential value than a DNA match made without the use of a DNA database.&lt;ref&gt;Rose &amp; Goos "DNA - A Practical Guide" (Carswell Publications, Toronto).&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that DNA databases of criminal offenders reduce crime rates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doleac|first=Jennifer L.|date=2017-01-01|title=The Effects of DNA Databases on Crime|url=http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/10.1257/app.20150043|journal=American Economic Journal: Applied Economics|volume=9|issue=1|pages=165–201|doi=10.1257/app.20150043|issn=1945-7782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

===Forensic===
A centralised DNA database for storing DNA profiles of individuals that enables searching and comparing of DNA samples collected from a crime scene against stored profiles. The most important function of the forensic database is to produce matches between the suspected individual and crime scene bio-markers, and then provides evidence to support criminal investigations, and also leads to identify potential suspects in the criminal investigation. Majority of the National DNA databases are used for forensic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.lsspjournal.com/content/9/1/12|title=Forensic DNA databases in European countries: is size linked to performance?|journal=Life Sciences, Society and Policy|first1=Filipe|last1=Santos|first2=Helena|last2=Machado|first3=Susana|last3=Silva|date=3 December 2013|publisher=|volume=9|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/2195-7819-9-12|pmc=4513018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Interpol]] DNA database is used in criminal investigations. Interpol maintains an automated DNA database called DNA Gateway that contains DNA profiles submitted by member countries collected from crime scenes, missing persons, and unidentified bodies.&lt;ref name="interpol.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interpol.int/INTERPOL-expertise/Forensics/DNA|title=DNA / Forensics / INTERPOL expertise / Internet / Home - INTERPOL|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA Gateway was established in 2002, and at the end of 2013, it had more than 140,000 DNA profiles from 69 member countries. Unlike other DNA databases, DNA Gateway is only used for information sharing and comparison, it does not link a DNA profile to any individual, and the physical or psychological conditions of an individual are not included in the database.&lt;ref name="interpol.int"/&gt;

===Genealogical===
A national or forensic DNA database is not available for non-police purposes. DNA profiles can also be used for genealogical purposes, so that a separate [[genetic genealogy]] database needs to be created that stores DNA profiles of [[genealogical DNA test]] results. GenBank is a public genetic genealogy database that stores genome sequences submitted by many genetic genealogists. Until now, GenBank has contained large number of DNA sequences gained from more than 140,000 registered organizations, and is updated every day to ensure a uniform and comprehensive collection of sequence information. These databases are mainly obtained from individual laboratories or large-scale sequencing projects. The files stored in GenBank are divided into different groups, such as BCT (bacterial), VRL (viruses), PRI (primates)…etc. People can access GenBank from NCBI’s retrieval system, and then use “BLAST” function to identify a certain sequence within the GenBank or to find the similarities between two sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2012/11/26/nar.gks1195|title=GenBank|first1=Dennis A.|last1=Benson|first2=Mark|last2=Cavanaugh|first3=Karen|last3=Clark|first4=Ilene|last4=Karsch-Mizrachi|first5=David J.|last5=Lipman|first6=James|last6=Ostell|first7=Eric W.|last7=Sayers|date=27 November 2012|publisher=|journal=Nucleic Acids Res.|volume=41|issue=Database issue|pages=D36–42|via=nar.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1093/nar/gks1195|pmid=23193287|pmc=3531190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical===
A medical DNA database is a DNA database of medically relevant genetic variations. It collects an individual's DNA which can reflect their medical records and lifestyle details. Through recording DNA profiles, scientists may find out the interactions between the genetic environment and occurrence of certain diseases (such as cardiovascular disease or cancer), and thus finding some new drugs or effective treatments in controlling these diseases. It is often collaborated with the National Health Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hagmann | first1 = M | year = 2000 | title = UK plans major medical DNA database | url = | journal = Science | volume = 287 | issue = 5456| pages = 1184–1184 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National===
A national DNA database is a DNA database maintained by the government for storing DNA profiles of its population. Each DNA profile based on PCR and uses STR (Short Tandem Repeats) analysis. They are generally used for forensic purposes which includes searching and matching of DNA profiles of potential criminal suspects.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=44tX9Ole490C&amp;pg=PP2|title=Advanced Topics in Forensic DNA Typing: Methodology|first=John M.|last=Butler|date=27 July 2011|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-387823-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 [[Interpol]] reported there were 54 police national DNA databases in the world at the time and 26 more countries planned to start one.&lt;ref name = Interpol&gt;{{cite web|title=Global DNA Profiling Survey; Results and Analysis|url=http://www.dnaresource.com/documents/2008INTERPOLGLOBALDNASURVEYREPORTV2.pdf|publisher=Interpol DNA Unit|page = Appendix  1|date = 2009|accessdate=12 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe Interpol reported there were 31 national DNA databases and six more planned.&lt;ref name = Interpol/&gt; The European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) DNA working group made 33 recommendations in 2014 for DNA database management and guidelines for auditing DNA databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enfsi.eu/sites/default/files/documents/enfsi_2014_document_on_dna-database_management_0.pdf ENFSI DNA Working Group. (2010). DNA database management: Review and Recommendation.

Typically, a tiny subset of the individual's genome is sampled from 13 or 16 regions that have high individuation.

====United Kingdom====
The first national DNA database in the [[United Kingdom]] was established in April 1995, called [[United Kingdom National DNA Database|National DNA Database]] (NDNAD). By 2006, it contained 2.7 million DNA profiles (about 5.2% of the UK population), as well as other information from individuals and crime scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Linacre | first1 = A | year = 2003 | title = The UK National DNA Database | url = | journal = The Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9372| pages = 1841–1842 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(03)13539-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This had increased to 5.7 million profiles by 2015.&lt;ref name=UKGOV&gt;{{cite web|title=National DNA Database statistics, Q1 2015 to 2016|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-dna-database-statistics|website=National DNA Database statistics|publisher=UK Government Home Office|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=NPIA UK (Communications), Gav Ireland, Simon Lewis, Dan Fookes |url=http://www.npia.police.uk/en/13338.htm |title=NPIA: Statistics |publisher=Npia.police.uk |date=2012-03-31 |accessdate=2012-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617063258/http://www.npia.police.uk/en/13338.htm |archivedate=2012-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The information is stored in the form of a digital code, which is based on the nomenclature of each STR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biotechniques.com/multimedia/archive/00010/02322rv01_10609a.pdf Gill, P.

Biotechniques, 32(2), 366–385.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, police have wide-ranging powers to take DNA samples and retain them if the subject is convicted of a recordable offence.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bowcott|first1=Owen|title=Retention of offenders' DNA profiles not illegal, supreme court rules|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/13/retention-of-offenders-dna-does-not-breach-privacy-supreme-court-rules|accessdate=11 October 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Identification_by_body_samples_and_impressions#Section_82:_Restrictions_on_use_and_destruction_of_fingerprints_and_samples Restrictions on use and destruction of fingerprints and samples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223205051/http://www.wikicrimeline.co.uk/index.php?title=Identification_by_body_samples_and_impressions |date=2007-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the large amount of DNA profiles which have been stored in NDNAD, "cold hits" may happen during the DNA matching, which means finding an unexpected match between an individual's DNA profile and an unsolved crime-scene DNA profile.This can introduce a new suspect into the investigation, thus helping to solve the old cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://embor.embopress.org/content/7/1S/S26|title=The UK National DNA Database|journal=EMBO Reports|first=Helen|last=Wallace|date=1 July 2006|publisher=|volume=7|issue=1S|pages=S26–S30|via=embor.embopress.org|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400727|pmid=16819445|pmc=1490298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and Wales, anyone arrested on suspicion of a [[recordable offence]] must submit a DNA sample, the profile of which is then stored on the DNA database. Those not charged or not found guilty have their DNA data deleted within a specified period of time.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Protection of Freedoms Act 2012: DNA and fingerprint provisions|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/protection-of-freedoms-act-2012-dna-and-fingerprint-provisions/protection-of-freedoms-act-2012-how-dna-and-fingerprint-evidence-is-protected-in-law|website=Protection of Freedoms Act 2012: how DNA and fingerprint evidence is protected in law|publisher=UK Government Home Office|date = 4 April 2014|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scotland, the law similarly requires the DNA profiles of most people who are acquitted be removed from the database.

====New Zealand====
[[New Zealand]] was the second country to set up a DNA database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esr.cri.nz/forensic-science/ Forensic Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
The [[United States]] national DNA database is called [[Combined DNA Index System]] (CODIS). It is maintained at three levels: national, state and local. Each level implemented its own DNA index system. The  national DNA index system (NDIS) allows DNA profiles to be exchanged and compared between participated laboratories nationally. Each state DNA index system (SDIS) allows DNA profiles to be exchanged and compared between the laboratories of various states and the local DNA index system (LDIS) allows DNA profiles collected at local sites and uploaded to SDIS and NDIS.

CODIS software integrates and connects all the DNA index systems at the three levels. CODIS is installed on each participating laboratory site and uses a standalone network known as Criminal Justice Information Systems Wide Area Network (CJIS WAN)&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/biometric-analysis/codis/codis_brochure CODIS Brochure]&lt;/ref&gt; to connect to other laboratories. In order to decrease the number of irrelevant matches at NDIS, the Convicted Offender Index requires all 13 CODIS [[Short tandem repeat|STR]]s to be present for a profile upload.  Forensic profiles only require 10 of the STRs to be present for an upload.

As of 2011, over 9 million records were held within CODIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/codis/|title=Laboratory Services|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2011, 361,176 forensic profiles and 9,404,747 offender profiles have been accumulated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/codis/ndis-statistics|title=CODIS - NDIS Statistics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest DNA database in the world.  As of the same date, CODIS has produced over 138,700 matches to requests, assisting in more than 133,400 investigations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/codis/aidedmap.htm Investigations Aided] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406115009/https://www.fbi.gov/hq/lab/codis/aidedmap.htm |date=April 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing public approval of DNA databases has seen the creation and expansion of many states' own DNA databases.  [[California]] currently maintains the third largest DNA database in the world.  Political measures such as [[California Proposition 69]] (2004), which increased the scope of the DNA database, have already met with a significant increase in numbers of investigations aided. Forty-nine states in the [[United States|USA]], all apart from Idaho, store DNA profiles of violent offenders, and many also store profiles of suspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-says-police-can-take-dna-swabs-after-arrest/ |title=Supreme Court says police can take DNA swabs after arrest| work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study showed that DNA databases in U.S. states "deter crime by profiled offenders, reduce crime rates, and are more cost-effective than traditional law enforcement tools".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

CODIS is also used to help find missing persons and identify human remains.  It is connected to the [[National Missing Persons DNA Database]]; samples provided by family members are sequenced by the [[University of North Texas Center for Human Identification]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://identifyus.org/help/NamUs-DNA_Protocol_for_Collection.pdf Family DNA Collection Protocol]&lt;/ref&gt; which also runs the [[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]].  UNTCHI can sequence both nuclear and [[mitochondrial DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.untchi.org/MissingPersons.html Missing Persons Unit]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Defense maintains a DNA database to identify the remains of servicemembers.  The [[Department of Defense Serum Repository]] maintains more than 50,000,000 records, primarily to assist in the identification of human remains.  Submission of DNA samples is mandatory for US servicemen, but the database also includes information on military dependents.  The National Defense Authorization Act of 2003 provided a means for federal courts or military judges to order the use of the DNA information collected to be made available for the purpose of investigation or prosecution of a felony, or any sexual offense, for which no other source of DNA information is reasonably available.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councilforresponsiblegenetics.org/geneticprivacy/DNA_mil.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Australia====
The Australian national DNA database is called the National Criminal Investigation DNA Database (NCIDD). By July 2018, it contained 837,000+ DNA profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.acic.gov.au/our-services/biometric-matching/national-criminal-investigation-dna-database|first=Australian Criminal Intelligence|last=Commission|date=18 July 2018|title=National Criminal Investigation DNA Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aic.gov.au/media_library/conferences/outlook4/mobbs.pdf Mobbs, Jonathan D. "Crimtrac-technology and detection." 4th National Outlook Symposium on Crime in Australia, New Crimes or New Responses.

====Canada====
The Canadian national DNA database is called the National DNA Data Bank (NDDB) which was established  in 1998 but first used in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3834530 | pmid=24312124 | doi=10.3389/fgene.2013.00249 | volume=4 | title=The National DNA Data Bank of Canada: a Quebecer perspective | journal=Front Genet | pages=249 | last1 = Milot | first1 = E | last2 = Lecomte | first2 = MM | last3 = Germain | first3 = H | last4 = Crispino | first4 = F| year=2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation that Parliament enacted to govern the use of this technology within the criminal justice system has been found by Canadian courts to be respectful of the constitutional and privacy rights of suspects, and of persons found guilty of designated offences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/prg/cor/tls/dna-eng.aspx "National DNA Data Bank"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625081506/http://www.publicsafety.gc.ca/prg/cor/tls/dna-eng.aspx |date=2013-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 11, 1999, The Canadian Government agreed upon the [[DNA Identification Act (Canada)|DNA Identification Act]]. This would allow a Canadian DNA data bank to be created and amended for the criminal code. This provides a mechanism for judges to request the offender to provide blood, buccal swabs, or hair samples from DNA profiles. This legislation became official on June 29, 2000. Canadian police has been using forensic DNA evidence for over a decade. It has become one of the most powerful tools available to law enforcement agencies for the administration of justice.&lt;ref name="rcmp-grc.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/nddb-bndg/index-accueil-eng.htm|title=National DNA Data Bank|first=Government of Canada, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, National DNA Data|last=Bank|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NDDB consists of two indexes: the Convicted Offender Index (COI) and National Crime Scene Index (CSI-nat). There is also the Local Crime Scene Index (CSI-loc) which is maintained by local laboratories but not NDDB as local DNA profiles do not meet NDDB collection criteria. Another National Crime Scene Index (CSI-nat) is a collection of three labs operated by Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Laboratory Sciences Judiciary Medicine Legal (LSJML) and Center of Forensic Sciences (CFS).

The collection includes DNA profiles from suspected and accused persons and convicted offenders. The Israeli database also include an “elimination bank” of profiles from laboratory staff and other police personnel who may have contact with the forensic evidence in the course of their work.

In order to handle the high throughput processing and analysis of DNA samples from FTA cards, the Israeli Police DNA database has established a semi-automated program LIMS, which enables a small number of police to finish processing a large number of samples in a relatively small period of time, and it is also responsible for the future tracking of samples.

S. (2012). Compression of Large DNA Databases (Doctoral dissertation, The University of Melbourne)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
DNA databases occupy more storage when compared to other non DNA databases due to the enormous size of each '''DNA sequence'''. Every year DNA databases grow exponentially. This poses a major challenge to the storage, data transfer, retrieval and searchin of these databases. To address these challenges DNA databases are compressed to save storage space and bandwidth during the data transfers. They are decompressed during search and retrieval. Various compression algorithms are used to compress and decompress. The efficiency of any compression algorithm depends how well and fast it compresses and decompresses, which is generally measured in compression ratio. The greater the compression ratio, the better the efficiency of an algorithm. At the same time, the speed of compression and decompression are also considered for evaluation.

DNA sequences contain palindromic repetitions of A, C, T, G. Compression of these sequences involve locating and encoding these repetitions and decoding them during decompression.

Some approaches used to encode and decode are:

# [[Huffman coding|Huffman Encoding]]
# [[Huffman coding#Adaptive Huffman coding|Adaptive Huffman Encoding]]
# [[Arithmetic coding]]
# [[Arithmetic coding#Adaptive arithmetic coding|Arithmetic coding]]
# [[Context tree weighting]] method

The [[compression algorithm]]s listed below may use one of the above encoding approaches to compress and decompress DNA database

# COMRAD
# RLZ
# GenCompress
# BioCompress
# DNACompress
# CTW+LZ

==Medicine==
Many countries collect newborn blood samples to [[Newborn screening|screen for diseases]] mainly with a genetic basis. Mainly these are destroyed soon after testing. In some countries the [[Dried blood spot testing|dried blood]] (and the DNA) is retained for later testing.  
 
In [[Denmark]] the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank at Statens Serum Institut keeps a blood sample from people born after 1981. The purpose is to test for [[phenylketonuria]] and other diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssi.dk/sw62846.asp#516_66584 &lt;!-- accessdate December 19, 2014 --&gt; ]{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also used for DNA profiling to identify deceased and suspected criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.b.dk/danmark/blodbank-som-forbryderalbum|title=Blodbank som forbryderalbum|date=16 September 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents can request that the blood sample of their newborn be destroyed after the result of the test is known.

Nowadays, the privacy and security issues of DNA database has caused huge attention. Some people are afraid that their personal DNA information will be let out easily, others may define their DNA profiles recording in the Databases as a sense of "criminal", and being falsely accused in a crime can lead to having a "criminal" record for the rest of their lives.

UK laws in [[Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001|2001]] and [[Criminal Justice Act 2003|2003]] allowed DNA profiles to be taken immediately after a person was arrested and kept in a Database even if the suspect was later acquitted.&lt;ref name = Wallace&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090536X14000239|title=Forensic DNA databases–Ethical and legal standards: A global review|first1=H.

In European countries which have established a DNA database, there are some measures which are being used to protect the privacy of individuals, more specifically, some criteria to help removing the DNA profiles from the databases. Among the 22 European countries which have been analyzed, most of the countries will record the DNA profiles of suspects or those who have committed serious crimes. For some countries (like Belgium and France) may remove the criminal’s profile after 30–40 years, because these “criminal investigation” database are no longer needed. Most of the countries will delete the suspect’s profile after they are acquitted…etc. All the countries have a completed legislation to largely avoid the privacy issues which may occur during the use of DNA database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.lsspjournal.com/content/9/1/12/abstract|title=Forensic DNA databases in European countries: is size linked to performance?|journal=Life Sciences, Society and Policy|first1=Filipe|last1=Santos|first2=Helena|last2=Machado|first3=Susana|last3=Silva|date=3 December 2013|publisher=|volume=9|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/2195-7819-9-12|pmc=4513018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Privacy issues surrounding DNA databases not only means privacy is threatened in collecting and analyzing DNA samples, it also exists in protecting and storing this important personal information. As the DNA profiles can be stored indefinitely in DNA database, it has raised concerns that these DNA samples can be used for new and unidentified purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/hascietlj2&amp;div=17&amp;id=&amp;page=|title=Concerns Associated with Expanding DNA Databases Note 2 Hastings Science and Technology Law Journal 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase of the users who access the DNA database, people are worried about their information being let out or shared inappropriately, for example, their DNA profile may be shared with others such as law enforcement agencies or countries without individual consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/dna-databank-proposal-raises-privacy-concerns|title=DNA databank proposal raises privacy concerns - The National|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of DNA databases have been expanded into two controversial areas: arrestees and familial searching. An arrestee is a person arrested for a crime and who has not yet been convicted for that offense. Currently, 21 states in the a United States have passed legislation that allows law enforcement to take DNA from an arrestee and enter it into the state's CODIS DNA database to see if that person has a criminal record or can be linked to any unsolved crimes. In familial searching, the DNA database is used to look for partial matches that would be expected between close family members.  This technology can be used to link crimes to the family members of suspects and thereby help identify a suspect when the perpetrator has no DNA sample in the database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnaforensics.com/|title=DNA Forensics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40077.pdf Compulsory DNA Collection: A Fourth Amendment Analysis] [[Congressional Research Service]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, DNA databases could fall into the wrong hands due to [[data breach]]es or data sharing.

==DNA collection and human rights==
In a judgement in December 2008, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] ruled that two British men should not have had their DNA and fingerprints retained by police saying that retention "could not be regarded as necessary in a democratic society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7764069.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; DNA database 'breach of rights' |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-12-04 |accessdate=2012-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DNA fingerprinting pioneer Professor [[Alec Jeffreys|Sir Alec Jeffreys]] condemned UK government plans to keep the genetic details of hundreds of thousands of innocent people in England and Wales for up to 12 years. Jeffreys said he was "disappointed" with the proposals, which came after a European court ruled that the current policy breaches people's right to privacy. Jefferys said "It seems to be as about as minimal a response to the European court of human rights judgment as one could conceive. There is a presumption not of innocence but of future guilt here … which I find very disturbing indeed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=James Sturcke |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/may/07/dna-database-plans-condemned |title=DNA pioneer condemns plans to retain data on innocent &amp;#124; Politics &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2009-05-07|accessdate=2012-08-04 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects on crime ==
A 2017 study in the ''[[American Economic Journal|American Economic Journal: Applied Economics]]'' showed that databases of criminal offenders' DNA profiles in US states "deter crime by profiled offenders, reduce crime rates, and are more cost-effective than traditional law enforcement tools."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Monozygotic Twins==

[[Monozygotic twins]] share around 99.99% of their DNA, while other siblings share around 50%. Some [[next generation sequencing]] tools are capable of detecting rare [[de novo mutations]] in only one of the twins (detectable in rare [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s).&lt;ref name="Weber-LehmannSchilling2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weber-Lehmann|first1=Jacqueline|last2=Schilling|first2=Elmar|last3=Gradl|first3=Georg|last4=Richter|first4=Daniel C.|last5=Wiehler|first5=Jens|last6=Rolf|first6=Burkhard|title=Finding the needle in the haystack: Differentiating “identical” twins in paternity testing and forensics by ultra-deep next generation sequencing|journal=Forensic Science International: Genetics|volume=9|year=2014|pages=42–46|issn=18724973|doi=10.1016/j.fsigen.2013.10.015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most DNA testing tools would not detect these rare SNPs in most twins.

Each person’s DNA is unique to them to the slight exception of identical (monozygotic and monospermotic) twins, who start out from the identical genetic line of DNA but during the twinning event have incredibly small mutations which can be detected now (for all intents and purposes, compared to all other humans and even to theoretical "clones, [who would not share the same uterus nor experience the same mutations pre-twinning event]" identical twins have more identical DNA than is probably possible to achieve between any other two humans). Tiny differences between identical twins can now (2014) be detected by next generation sequencing. For current fiscally available testing, "identical" twins cannot be easily differentiated by the most common DNA testing, but it has been shown to be possible. While other siblings (including fraternal twins) share about 50% of their DNA, monozygotic twins share virtually 99.99%. Beyond these more recently discovered twinning-event mutation disparities, since 2008 it has been known that people who are identical twins also each have their own set of copy number variants, which can be thought of as the number of copies they each personally exhibit for certain sections of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Am J Hum Genet. 2008 Mar;82(3):763-71. doi: 10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.12.011. Epub 2008 Feb 14.
Phenotypically concordant and discordant monozygotic twins display different DNA copy-number-variation profiles.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Held''' (born 1951) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[political scientist]] specialising in [[political theory]] and [[international relations]]. He currently holds a joint appointment as Professor of Politics and International Relations, and Master of [[University College, Durham|University College]], at [[Durham University]]. He is also a visiting Professor of Political Science at [[Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli]]. Previously he was the [[Graham Wallas]] chair of Political Science and the co-director of the Centre for the Study of Global Governance at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name="Vasagar"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2011/oct/31/saif-gaddafi-lse-academic | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jeevan | last=Vasagar | title=Academic linked to Gaddafi's fugitive son leaves LSE | date=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Daniele Archibugi]], Held has been prominent in the development of [[cosmopolitanism]], and of [[cosmopolitan democracy]] in particular. He has been an active scholar on issues of [[globalisation]], [[global governance]] and is joint editor-in-chief of the academic journal ''[[Global Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff writer | title = Editorial Board | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/%28ISSN%291758-5899/homepage/EditorialBoard.html | website = onlinelibrary.wiley.com | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]] | access-date = 20 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
David Held was born in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] where he spent most of his childhood. He was educated in Britain, [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United States]]. Upon completing his doctoral studies at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] he conducted post-doctoral research at [[Cambridge University]]. He has held numerous Visiting Appointments in the United States, [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], among other places.

David Held co-founded [[Polity (publisher)|Polity press]] in 1984, which has become a leading publisher in the social sciences and humanities across the world. He is also the General Editor for ''[[Global Policy]]'', an academic journal started in 2008 that focuses on bridging the gap between academics and practitioners on issues of global significance.

In January 2012, he succeeded Professor [[Maurice Tucker]] as Master of [[University College, Durham]], alongside his chair in the School of Government and International Affairs at [[Durham University]].&lt;ref name="palatinate"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.palatinate.org.uk/?p=16306|work=Palatinate|last=Jonhson|first=Daniel|date=2 November 2011|title=Former LSE academic linked to Gaddafi’s son made new Castle Master}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research== 
Since his first book was published in 1980 (''Introduction to Critical Theory''), David Held has been pursuing a multilevel inquiry into the nature and changing form of national and international politics. This approach has involved three kinds of work. First, it has involved extensive empirical enquiry into the dynamic character, structural elements and governance failures of contemporary society. The empirical dimensions of his work have included books such as ''Global Transformations'' (1999), ''Globalization/Anti-globalization'' (2007), ''Global Inequality'' (2007) and ''Gridlock: Why Global Cooperation is Failing When We Need it Most'' (2013). These books map the changing global context of politics, how the world has become increasingly interconnected, and how failures of leadership and negotiation at the global level are creating a breakdown of multilateralism and global governance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Second, he has been investigating the changing nature and form of the modern state and the locus of the political good. Held examines the question of whether the nation state alone, as typically assumed by political theory, can be the sole home of democracy, accountability and the rule of law. This has entailed a critical evaluation of the concepts of democracy, sovereignty, governance and cosmopolitanism, among other concepts. Books that have explored these themes include: ''Democracy in the Global Order'' (1999), ''Models of Democracy'' (2006), ''Cosmopolitanism: ideals and realities'' (2010). {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The third element of Prof. Held’s current work is to explore how and in what ways one can move beyond the crises and dilemmas of politics and governance in the contemporary world. Books such as ''Global Covenant'' (2004), ''Debating Globalization'' (2005) and a wide range of academic articles set out the contours of a multiactor, multilevel democratic politics framed by the fundamental principles of democracy, justice and sustainability.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Accordingly, Held’s work explores, on the one hand, the shift in politics from nation states to what he calls a world of ‘overlapping communities of fate' (where the fortunes of countries are increasingly enmeshed) and, on the other hand, how democratic standards and cosmopolitan values can be entrenched in the global order. In pursuing this multilevel approach Prof. Held sees himself working within the classic tradition of political theory which has always been concerned with how to characterize the world in which we live, how to develop and reach normative goals such as liberty, democracy and social justice, and how to move from where we are to where we might like to be. Prof. Held’s response to this challenge is to explore the way globalization has altered the landscape of politics{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}, how cosmopolitanism provides ideals that enable one to rethink politics and the political good, and to pursue political stepping stones that could help embed this agenda. He offers a contribution to a pressing dialogue of our times: how to resolve collective action problems, nationally and globally, through institutions and governance arrangements that enhance democracy, social justice and the participation of all citizens in a democratic public life.

==Links to Libya==

{{Main article|LSE Libya Links}}
In March, 2011, Held's name came to be linked with the [[LSE Libya Links]] controversy.  Held was an advisor of [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], son of Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]], who received his PhD from LSE in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Deasy.

=== Habitat destruction and fragmentation ===
[[File:Lacanja burn.JPG|thumb|Lacanja burn shows deforestation]]

Human population growth results in changes in land-use, which can cause natural habitats to become fragmented, altered, or destroyed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Large mammals are often more vulnerable to extinction than smaller animals because they require larger [[home range]]s and thus are more prone to suffer the effects of [[deforestation]]. Large species such as [[elephant]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, large [[primate]]s, [[tapir]]s and [[Peccary|peccaries]] are the first animals to disappear in fragmented [[rainforest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kinnaird, M. F., Sanderson, E. W., O'Brien, T. G., Wibisono, H. T. and Woolmer, G., "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Sanderson2/publication/227602224_Deforestation_Trends_in_a_Tropical_Landscape_and_Implications_for_Endangered_Large_Mammals/links/0912f5108705b72742000000.pdf Deforestation Trends in a Tropical Landscape and Implications for Endangered Large Mammals.]" ''Conservation Biology'' (2003) 17: 245–257.&lt;/ref&gt;

A case study from Amazonian Ecuador analyzed two oil-road management approaches and their effects on the surrounding wildlife communities. The free-access road had forests that were cleared and fragmented and the other had enforced access control. Fewer species were found along the first road with density estimates being almost 80% lower than at the second site that which had minimal disturbance.&lt;ref name="oil roads"&gt;Suárez, E., Morales, M., Cueva, R., Utreras Bucheli, V., Zapata-Ríos, G., Toral, E., Torres, J., Prado, W. and Vargas Olalla, J., "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Galo_Zapata-Rios/publication/229528550_Oil_Industry_Wild_Meat_Trade_and_Roads_Indirect_Effects_of_Oil_Extraction_Activities_in_a_Protected_Area_in_North-Eastern_Ecuador/links/02e7e528ccfdcbb399000000/Oil-Industry-Wild-Meat-Trade-and-Roads-Indirect-Effects-of-Oil-Extraction-Activities-in-a-Protected-Area-in-North-Eastern-Ecuador.pdf Oil Industry, Wild Meat Trade and Roads: Indirect Effects of Oil Extraction Activities in a Protected Area in North-Eastern Ecuador.]" ''Animal Conservation'' 12 (2009): 364–373.&lt;/ref&gt; This finding suggests that disturbances affected the local animals' willingness and ability to travel between patches.[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|Fishbone deforestation pattern. This was found in Brazil and is visible from satellite]]

[[Habitat fragmentation|Fragmentation]] lowers populations while increasing extinction risk when the remaining [[habitat]] size is small.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When there is more unfragmented land, there is more habitat for more diverse species. A larger land patch also means it can accommodate more species with larger [[home range]]s.  However, when patch size decreases, there is an increase in the number of isolated fragments which can remain unoccupied by local [[fauna]]. If this persists, species may become extinct in the area.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Rybicki, J., "[http://izt.ciens.ucv.ve/ecologia/Archivos/ECO_POB%202013/ECOPO2_2013/Ecological%20effects%20of%20environ.%20change/Rybicki%20y%20Hanski%202013.pdf Species–area Relationships and Extinctions Caused by Habitat Loss and Fragmentation.]" ''Ecology Letters'' 16 (2013): 27-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study on [[deforestation of the Amazon rainforest|deforestation in the Amazon]] looked at two patterns of [[habitat fragmentation]]: "fish-bone" in smaller properties and another unnamed large property pattern. The large property pattern contained fewer fragments than the smaller fish-bone pattern. The results suggested that higher levels of fragmentation within the fish-bone pattern led to the [[loss of species]] and decreased diversity of large vertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, D. A., Hobbs, R. J. and Margules, C.

=== Invasive species ===

Human influences, such as colonization and agriculture, have caused species to become distributed outside of their native ranges.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Fragmentation also has cascading effects on native species, beyond reducing habitat and resource availability; it leaves areas vulnerable to non-native invasions. [[Invasive species]] can out-compete or directly prey upon native species, as well as alter the habitat so that native species can no longer survive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oil roads"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeschke, J., et. al. "[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cobi.12299/full Defining the Impact of Non-Native Species.]" ''Conservation Biology'' 28.5 (2014): 1188-1194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In extinct animal species for which the cause of extinction is known, over 50% were affected by invasive species. For 20% of extinct animal species, invasive species are the only cited cause of extinction. Invasive species are the second-most important cause of extinction for mammals.&lt;ref&gt;Clavero, M., Garcia-Berthou, E.

== Global patterns ==

Tropical regions are the most heavily impacted by defaunation.&lt;ref name="def ant" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt; These regions, which include the [[Brazilian Amazon]], the [[Congo Basin]] of Central Africa, and [[Indonesia]], experience the greatest rates of overexploitation and [[habitat degradation]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, specific causes are varied, and areas with one endangered group (such as birds) do not necessarily also have other endangered groups (such as mammals, insects, or amphibians).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: Global map shows new patterns of extinction risk|url=http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/newsandeventspggrp/imperialcollege/newssummary/news_2-11-2006-10-49-47|work=Imperial College London and the Natural Environment Research Council|date=2 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon leads to habitat fragmentation and overexploitation. Hunting pressure in the Amazon rainforest has increased as traditional hunting techniques have been replaced by modern weapons such as shotguns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Access roads built for mining and logging operations fragment the forest landscape and allow hunters to move into forested areas which previously were untouched.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The bushmeat trade in Central Africa incentivizes the overexploitation of local fauna.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Indonesia has the most endangered animal species of any area in the world.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Endangered Species in Indonesia - Australian Science|url = http://www.australianscience.com.au/environmental-science/endangered-species-in-indonesia/|website = Australian Science|accessdate = 2015-11-30|language = en-US|first = Ivanovic,|last = Josip}}&lt;/ref&gt; International trade in wild animals, as well as extensive logging, mining and agriculture operations, drive the decline and extinction of numerous species.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Ecological impacts ==

=== Genetic loss ===
[[Inbreeding]] and [[genetic diversity]] loss often occur with endangered species populations because they have small and/or declining populations. Loss of genetic diversity lowers the ability of a population to deal with change in their environment and can make individuals within the community [[homogeneous]]. If this occurs, these animals are more susceptible to [[disease]] and other occurrences that may target a specific [[genome]]. Without genetic diversity, one disease could eradicate an entire species. Inbreeding lowers reproduction and [[survival rate]]s. It is suggested that these genetic factors contribute to the extinction risk in threatened/endangered species.&lt;ref&gt;Frankham, R., "Genetics and Conservation Biology." C. R. ''Biologies'' 326 (2003): S22-S29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seed dispersal ===

==== Effects on plants and forest structure ====
The consequences of defaunation can be expected to affect the plant community. There are three non-mutually exclusive conclusions as to the consequences on tropical forest plant communities:

# If seed dispersal agents are targeted by hunters, the effectiveness and amount of dispersal for those plant species will be reduced&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt;
# The species composition of the [[seedling]] and [[sapling]] layers will be altered by hunting,&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt; and
# Selective hunting of medium/large-sized animals instead of small-sized animals will lead to different seed predation patterns, with an emphasis on smaller seeds&lt;ref name="eco and evo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Galetti 2–7"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Defaunation affects the populations and diets of rodents in Neotropical rainforests|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S000632071500186X|journal = Biological Conservation|date = 2015-10-01|pages = 2–7|volume = 190|doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2015.04.032|first = Mauro|last = Galetti|first2 = Roger|last2 = Guevara|first3 = Carolina L.|last3 = Neves|first4 = Raisa R.|last4 = Rodarte|first5 = Ricardo S.|last5 = Bovendorp|first6 = Marcelo|last6 = Moreira|first7 = John B.|last7 = Hopkins III|first8 = Justin D.|last8 = Yeakel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent study analyzed seedling density and composition from two areas, Los Tuxtlas and Montes Azules. Los Tuxtlas, which is affected more by human activity, showed higher seedling density and a smaller average number of different species than in the other area. Results suggest that an absence of vertebrate dispersers can change the structure and diversity of forests.&lt;ref&gt;Dirzo, R. and Miranda, A.

In: ''Plant-Animal Interactions: Evolutionary ecology in tropical and temperate regions''. P. W. Price, T. M. Lewinsohn, G. W. Fernandes &amp; W. W. Benson (Eds.). Wiley and Sons Pub. New York pp: 273-287.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a plant community that relies on animals for dispersal could potentially have an altered [[biodiversity]], species [[Dominance (ecology)|dominance]], survival, [[demography]], and spatial and genetic structure.&lt;ref&gt;Beaune, David. "[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Beaune/publication/256303581_Seed_dispersal_strategies_and_the_threat_of_defaunation_in_a_Congo_forest/links/00b4952246469ee96c000000.pdf Seed Dispersal Strategies and the Threat of Defaunation in a Congo Forest]." ''Biodiversity and Conservation'' 22.1 (2013): 225-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Poaching is likely to alter plant composition because the interactions between game and plant species varies in strength. Some game species interact strongly, weakly, or not at all with species. A change in plant species composition is likely to be a result because the net effect removal of game species varies among the plant species they interact with.&lt;ref name="poachers alter"/&gt;

==== Effects on small-bodied seed dispersers and predators ====

As large-bodied vertebrates are increasingly lost from seed-dispersal networks, small-bodied seed dispersers (i.e. bats, birds, dung beetles) and seed predators (i.e. rodents) are affected. Defaunation leads to reduced species diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Seed predation in a human-modified tropical landscape|url = http://journals.cambridge.org/article_S026646741500019X|journal = Journal of Tropical Ecology|date = 2015-07-01|issn = 1469-7831|pages = 379–383|volume = 31|issue = 4|doi = 10.1017/S026646741500019X|first = Jenny|last = Zambrano|first2 = Rosamond|last2 = Coates|first3 = Henry F.|last3 = Howe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Selective defaunation affects dung beetle communities in continuous Atlantic rainforest|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320713000992|journal = Biological Conservation|date = 2013-07-01|pages = 79–89|volume = 163|series = Special Issue: Defaunation's impact in terrestrial tropical ecosystems|doi = 10.1016/j.biocon.2013.04.004|first = Laurence|last = Culot|first2 = Emilie|last2 = Bovy|first3 = Fernando|last3 = Zagury Vaz-de-Mello|first4 = Roger|last4 = Guevara|first5 = Mauro|last5 = Galetti}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to relaxed competition; small-bodied species normally compete with large-bodied vertebrates for food and other resources. As an area becomes defaunated, dominant small-bodied species take over, crowding out other similar species and leading to an overall reduced species diversity.&lt;ref name="Galetti 2–7"/&gt; The loss of species diversity is reflective of a larger [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], which has consequences for the maintenance of [[ecosystem services]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The quality of the physical habitat may also suffer. Bird and bat species (many of who are small bodied seed dispersers) rely on [[Geophagy|mineral licks]] as a source of sodium, which is not available elsewhere in their diets. In defaunated areas in the Western Amazon, mineral licks are more thickly covered by vegetation and have lower water availability. Bats were significantly less likely to visit these degraded mineral licks.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Defaunation of tropical forests reduces habitat quality for seed-dispersing bats in Western Amazonia: an unexpected connection via mineral licks|journal = Animal Conservation|date = 2014-02-01|issn = 1469-1795|pages = 44–51|volume = 17|issue = 1|doi = 10.1111/acv.12055|first = S. J.|last = Ghanem|first2 = C. C.|last2 = Voigt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degradation of such licks will thus negatively affect the health and reproduction of bat populations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Defaunation has negative consequences for seed dispersal networks as well. In the western Amazon, birds and bats have separate diets and thus form separate [[Guild (ecology)|guilds]] within the network.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Partitioning of seed dispersal services between birds and bats in a fragment of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest|url = http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1984-46702014000300006&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal = Zoologia (Curitiba)|issn = 1984-4670|pages = 245–255|volume = 31|issue = 3|doi = 10.1590/S1984-46702014000300006|first = Raissa|last = Sarmento|first2 = Cecília P.|last2 = Alves-Costa|first3 = Adriana|last3 = Ayub|first4 = Marco A. R.|last4 = Mello|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that large-bodied vertebrates, being generalists, connect separate guilds, creating a stable, [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] network. Defaunation results in a highly modular network in which specialized frugivores instead act as the connector hubs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Ecosystem services===
{{main|ecosystem services}}
Changes in predation dynamics, seed predation, seed dispersal, carrion removal, dung removal, vegetation trampling, and other ecosystem processes as a result of defaunation can affect ecosystem supporting and regulatory services, such as [[nutrient cycling]] and [[decomposition]], crop pollination, [[pest control]], and [[water quality]].&lt;ref name="def ant" /&gt;

=== Conservation ===
Efforts against defaunation include wildlife overpasses&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pell|first=Stuart|last2=Jones|first2=Darryl|date=2015-04-01|title=Are wildlife overpasses of conservation value for birds?

Wildlife overpasses are specifically used for the purpose of protecting many animal species from the roads.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Many countries use them and they have been found to be very effective in protecting species and allowing forests to be connected.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; These overpasses look like bridges of forest that cross over many roads, like a walk bridge for humans, allowing animals to migrate from one side of the forest to the other safely since the road cut off the original connectivity.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It was concluded in a study done by Pell and Jones, looking at bird use of these corridors in Australia, that many birds did, in fact, use these corridors to travel from one side of forest to the other and although they did not spend much time in the corridor specifically, they did commonly use them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Riparian corridors are very similar to overpasses they are just on flat land and not on bridges, however, they also work as connective "bridges" between fragmented pieces of forest. One study done connected the corridors with bird habitat and use for seed dispersal.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The conclusions of this study showed that some species of birds are highly dependent on these corridors as connections between forest, as flying across the open land is not ideal for many species.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Overall both of these studies agree that some sort of connectivity needs to be established between fragments in order to keep the forest ecosystem in the best health possible and that they have in fact been very effective.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Marine ==
Defaunation in the [[marine biology|ocean]] has occurred later and less intensely than on land. A relatively small number of marine species have been driven to extinction. However, many species have undergone local, ecological, and commercial extinction.&lt;ref name="mar def"&gt;McCauley, D. J., Pinsky, M. L., [[Stephen R. Palumbi|Palumbi, S. R.]], Estes, J.

Marine defaunation has a wide array of effects on ecosystem structure and function. The loss of animals can have both top-down (cascading) and bottom-up effects,&lt;ref&gt;Myers, R. A., Baum, J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49217">The '''Dormant Commerce Clause''', or '''Negative Commerce Clause''', in [[American constitutional law]], is a [[legal doctrine]] that courts in the [[United States]] have inferred from the [[Commerce Clause]] in [[Article I of the United States Constitution|Article I]] of the [[US Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Norman. "[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=700173 Why Congress May Not Overrule the Dormant Commerce Clause]", 53 UCLA L. Rev. 153 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; The Dormant Commerce Clause is used to prohibit state legislation that discriminates against interstate or international commerce.

For example, it is lawful for [[Michigan]] to require food labels that specifically identify certain animal parts, if they are present in the product, because the state law applies to food produced in Michigan as well as food imported from other states and foreign countries; the state law would violate the Commerce Clause if it applied only to imported food or if it was otherwise found to favor domestic over imported products. Likewise, [[California]] law requires milk sold to contain a certain percentage of milk solids that federal law does not require, which is allowed under the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine because California's stricter requirements apply equally to California-produced milk and imported milk and so does not discriminate against or inappropriately burden interstate commerce.&lt;ref&gt;California Department of Food and Agriculture – Milk Standards "[https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/ahfss/Milk_and_Dairy_Food_Safety/Milk_Standards.html]".&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the doctrine==
The idea that regulation of interstate commerce may to some extent be an exclusive Federal power was discussed even before adoption of the Constitution, but the framers did not use the word "dormant". On September 15, 1787, the [[Framers of the Constitution]] debated in [[Philadelphia]] whether to guarantee states the ability to lay duties of [[tonnage]] without Congressional interference so that the states could finance the clearing of [[harbors]] and the building of [[lighthouses]].&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"&gt;2 M. Farrand, [http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_10_3s2.html Records of the Federal Convention of 1787], p. 625 (1937) (1787-09-15).&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Madison]] believed that the mere existence of the Commerce Clause would bar states from imposing any duty of tonnage: "He was more and more convinced that the regulation of Commerce was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority."&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"/&gt;

[[Roger Sherman]] disagreed: "The power of the United States to regulate trade being supreme can control interferences of the State regulations when such interferences happen; so that there is no danger to be apprehended from a concurrent jurisdiction."&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"/&gt; Sherman saw the commerce power as similar to the tax power, the latter being one of the [[concurrent powers]] shared by the federal and state governments.  Ultimately, the [[Philadelphia Convention]] decided upon the present language about duties of tonnage in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 10: Limits on the States|Article I, Section 10]], which says: "No state shall, without the consent of Congress, lay any duty of tonnage ..."&lt;ref name="press-pubs.uchicago.edu"/&gt;

The word "dormant," in connection with the Commerce Clause, originated in [[dicta]] of Chief Justice [[John Marshall]]. For example, in the case of ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', {{ussc|22|1|1824}}, he wrote that the power to regulate interstate commerce "can never be exercised by the people themselves, but must be placed in the hands of agents, or lie dormant." Concurring Justice [[William Johnson (judge)|William Johnson]] was even more emphatic that the Constitution is "altogether in favor of the exclusive grants to Congress of power over commerce."

Later, in the case of ''[[Willson v. Black-Bird Creek Marsh Co.]]'', {{ussc|27|245|1829}}, Marshall wrote: "We do not think that the [state] act empowering the Black Bird Creek Marsh Company to place a dam across the creek, can, under all the circumstances of the case, be considered as repugnant to the power to regulate commerce in its dormant state, or as being in conflict with any law passed on the subject."

If Marshall was suggesting that the power over interstate commerce is an [[exclusive federal power]], the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine eventually developed very differently: it treats regulation that does not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce as a concurrent power, rather than an exclusive federal power, and it treats regulation that does so as an exclusive federal power. Thus, the modern doctrine says that congressional power over interstate commerce is somewhat exclusive but "not absolutely exclusive".&lt;ref&gt;Pommersheim, Frank.  [https://books.google.com/books?id=DbNdwTo2ENEC&amp;pg=PA41Broken Landscape : Indians, Indian Tribes, and the Constitution: Indians, Indian Tribes, and the Constitution], p. 41 (Oxford University Press 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; The approach began in the 1851 case of ''[[Cooley v. Board of Wardens]]'', in which Justice [[Benjamin R. Curtis]] wrote for the Court: "Either absolutely to affirm, or deny that the nature of this [commerce] power requires exclusive legislation by Congress, is to lose sight of the nature of the subjects of this power, and to assert concerning all of them, what is really applicable but to a part."&lt;ref name=Cooley&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=53&amp;page=299 Cooley v. Board of Wardens], 53 U.S. 299 (1851).&lt;/ref&gt;  The first clear holding of the Supreme Court striking down a state law under the Dormant Commerce Clause came in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;Reading Railroad v. Pennsylvania, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=82&amp;invol=232 82 U.S. (15 Wall.) 232 (1873)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of the doctrine==
Justice Anthony Kennedy has written that: "The central rationale for the rule against discrimination is to prohibit state or municipal laws whose object is local economic protectionism, laws that would excite those jealousies and retaliatory measures the Constitution was designed to prevent."&lt;ref&gt;C&amp;A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, N.Y., 511 U.S. 383 (1994) (quoting The Federalist No. 22, pp.&amp;nbsp;143&amp;ndash;145 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton);  Madison, Vices of the Political System of the United States, in 2 Writings of James Madison 362&amp;ndash;363 (G. Hunt ed. 1901)).&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to determine whether a law violates a so-called "dormant" aspect of the Commerce Clause, the court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce. In this context, "discrimination" simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.

Thus, in a dormant Commerce Clause case, a court is initially concerned with whether the law facially discriminates against out-of-state actors or has the effect of favoring in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests. Discriminatory laws motivated by "simple economic protectionism" are subject to a "virtually per se rule of invalidity", ''[[City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey]]'' 437 U.S. 617 (1978), ''[[Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison, Wisconsin]]'', 340 U.S. 349 (1951), ''[[Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm.]]'', 432 U.S. 333 (1977) which can only be overcome by a showing that the State has no other means to advance a legitimate local purpose, ''[[Maine v. Taylor]]'', 477 U.S. 131(1986). See also ''[[Brown-Forman Distillers v. New York State Liquor Authority]]'', {{ussc|476|573|1986}}.

On the other hand, when a law is "directed to legitimate local concerns, with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental" (United Haulers Association, Inc.), that is, where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade, the Court has adopted a much more flexible approach, the general contours of which were outlined in ''[[Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.]]'', 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970) and ''[[City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey]]'', 437 U.S. at 624.   If the law is not outright or intentionally discriminatory or protectionist, but still has some impact on interstate commerce, the court will evaluate the law using a balancing test. The Court determines whether the interstate burden imposed by a law outweighs the local benefits. If such is the case, the law is usually deemed unconstitutional.  See ''[[Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.]]'', {{ussc|397|137|1970}}. In the Pike case, the Court explained that a state regulation having only "incidental" effects on interstate commerce "will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits".  397 U.S. at 142, 90 S.Ct. at 847.  When weighing burdens against benefits, a court should consider both "the nature of the local interest involved, and ... whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities".  Id.  Thus regulation designed to implement public health and safety, or serve other legitimate state interests, but impact interstate commerce as an incident to that purpose, are subject to a test akin to the rational basis test, a minimum level of scrutiny. See ''[[Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines, Inc.]]'' In USA Recycling, Inc. v. Town of Babylon, 66 F.3d 1272, 1281 (C.A.2 (N.Y.), 1995), the court explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the state activity constitutes "regulation" of interstate commerce, then the court must proceed to a second inquiry: whether the activity  regulates evenhandedly with only "incidental" effects on interstate commerce, or discriminates against interstate commerce.  As we use the term here, "discrimination" simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter.  The party challenging the validity of a state statute or municipal ordinance bears the burden of showing that it discriminates against, or places some burden on, interstate commerce.  ''[[Hughes v. Oklahoma]]'', 441 U.S. 322, 336, 99 S.Ct. 1727, 1736, 60 L.Ed.2d 250 (1979).  If discrimination is established, the burden shifts to the state or local government to show that the local benefits of the statute outweigh its discriminatory effects, and that the state or municipality lacked a nondiscriminatory alternative that could have adequately protected the relevant local interests.  If the challenging party cannot show that the statute is discriminatory, then it must demonstrate that the statute places a burden on interstate commerce that "is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits."  ''[[Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.]]'', 449 U.S. 456, 471(1981) (quoting Pike, 397 U.S. at 142, 90 S.Ct. at 847).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==State taxation==
Over the years, the Supreme Court has consistently held that the language of the Commerce Clause contains a further, negative command prohibiting certain state taxation even when Congress has failed to legislate on the subject. Examples of such cases are ''[[Quill Corp. v. North Dakota]]'', 504 U.S. 298 (1992); ''[[Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota]]'', 358 U.S. 450, 458 (1959) and ''[[H.P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond]]'', 336 U.S. 525 (1949).

More recently, in the 2015 case of ''[[Comptroller of Treasury of MD. v. Wynne]]'',&lt;ref name=Wynne&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-485_o7jp.pdf Comptroller of Treasury of MD. v. Wynne] (No. 13-485, May 18, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; the Court addressed Maryland's unusual practice of taxing personal income earned in Maryland, and taxing personal income of its citizens earned outside Maryland, ''without'' any tax credit for income tax paid to other states.  The Court held this sort of double-taxation to be a violation of the dormant Commerce Clause.&lt;ref name=Wynne /&gt;  The Court faulted Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]'s criticism of the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine by saying that he failed to "explain why, under his interpretation of the Constitution, the Import-Export Clause 
would not lead to the same result that we reach under the dormant Commerce Clause".&lt;ref name=Wynne /&gt;

Application of the dormant commerce clause to state taxation is another manifestation of the Court's holdings that the Commerce Clause prevents a State from retreating into economic isolation or jeopardizing the welfare of the Nation as a whole, as it would do if it were free to place burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear. The Court's taxation decisions thus "reflected a central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention: the conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic [[Balkanization]] that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the [[Articles of Confederation]]." ''[[Wardair Canada, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue]]'', 477 U.S. 1 (1986); ''[[Hughes v. Oklahoma]]'', 441 U.S. 322 (1979); ''[[Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Jefferson Lines, Inc.]]'', 514 U.S. 175 (1995).

===Formalistic approach===
As with the Court's application of the dormant commerce clause to discriminatory regulation, the pre-[[New Deal]] Court attempted to apply a [[Commerce Clause#Dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence|formalistic approach]] to state taxation alleged to interfere with interstate commerce.  The history is described in ''[[Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Jefferson Lines, Inc.]]'', 514 U.S. 175 (1995):

&lt;blockquote&gt;The command has been stated more easily than its object has been attained, however, and the Court's understanding of the dormant Commerce Clause has taken some turns.   In its early stages, the Court held the view that interstate commerce was wholly immune from state taxation "in any form", "even though the same amount of tax should be laid on (intrastate) commerce".  This position gave way in time to a less uncompromising but formal approach, according to which, for example, the Court would invalidate a state tax levied on gross receipts from interstate commerce, or upon the "freight carried" in interstate commerce, but would allow a tax merely measured by gross receipts from interstate commerce as long as the tax was formally imposed upon franchises,  or "'in lieu of all taxes upon (the taxpayer's) property,'" Dissenting from this formal approach in 1927, Justice Stone remarked that it was "too mechanical, too uncertain in its application, and too remote from actualities, to be of value." &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Decline of formalism===
Accompanying the revolution in approach in the Court's Congressional powers jurisprudence, the New Deal Court began to change its approach to state taxation as well. The Jefferson Lines decision continues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1938, the old formalism began to give way with Justice Stone's opinion in ''[[Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue]]'', 303 U.S. 250, which examined New Mexico's franchise tax, measured by gross receipts, as applied to receipts from out-of-state advertisers in a journal produced by taxpayers in New Mexico but circulated both inside and outside the State.   Although the assessment could have been sustained solely on prior precedent, Justice Stone added a dash of the pragmatism that, with a brief interlude, has since become our aspiration in this quarter of the law.  ... The Court explained that "[i]t was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business."  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the transition period, some taxes were upheld based on a careful review of the actual economic impact of the tax, and other taxes were reviewed based on the kind of tax involved, whether the tax had a nefarious impact on commerce or not.  Under this formalistic approach, a tax might be struck down, and then re-passed with exactly the same economic incidence, but under another name, and then withstand review.

The absurdity of this approach was made manifest in the two Railway Express cases.  In the first, a tax imposed by the [[U.S. state|state]] of Virginia on [[United States|American]] business concerns operating within the state was struck down because it was a business privilege tax imposed on the privilege of doing business in interstate commerce. But then, in the second, Virginia revised the wording of its statute to impose a "franchise tax" on "intangible property" in the form of "going concern" value as measured by gross receipts.

The Court upheld the reworded statute as not violative of the prohibition on privilege taxes, even though the impact of the old tax and new were essentially identical. There was no real economic difference between the statutes in Railway Express I and Railway Express II. The Court long since had recognized that interstate commerce may be made to pay its way. Yet under the Spector rule, the economic realities in Railway Express I became irrelevant. The Spector rule (against privilege taxes) had come to operate only as a rule of draftsmanship, and served only to distract the courts and parties from their inquiry into whether the challenged tax produced results forbidden by the Commerce Clause.

The death knell of formalism occurred in ''[[Complete Auto Transit, Inc v. Brady]]'', 430 U.S. 274 (1977), [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=430&amp;invol=274] which approved a Mississippi privilege tax upon a Michigan company engaged in the business of shipping automobiles to Mississippi dealers.  The Court there explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Appellant's attack is based solely on decisions of this Court holding that a tax on the "privilege" of engaging in an activity in the State may not be applied to an activity that is part of interstate commerce. See, e. g., ''[[Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor]]'', 340 U.S. 602 (1951); ''[[Freeman v. Hewit]]'', 329 U.S. 249 (1946). This rule looks only to the fact that the incidence of the tax is the "privilege of doing business"; it deems irrelevant any consideration of the practical effect of the tax. The rule reflects an underlying philosophy that interstate commerce should enjoy a sort of "free trade" immunity from state taxation. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Complete Auto Transit is the last in a line of cases that gradually rejected a per se approach to state taxation challenges under the commerce clause.  In overruling prior decisions which struck down privilege taxes per se, the Court noted the following, in what has become a central component of commerce clause state taxation jurisprudence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We note again that no claim is made that the activity is not sufficiently connected to the State to justify a tax, or that the tax is not fairly related to benefits provided the taxpayer, or that the tax discriminates against interstate commerce, or that the tax is not fairly apportioned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These four factors, nexus, relationship to benefits, discrimination, and apportionment, have come to be regarded as the four Complete Auto Transit factors applied repeatedly in subsequent cases.  Complete Auto Transit must be recognized as the culmination of the Court's emerging commerce clause approach, not just in taxation, but in all of its aspects.  Application of Complete Auto Transit to State taxation remains a highly technical and specialized venture, requiring the application of commerce clause principles to an understanding of specialized tax law.&lt;!--   How does a federal court decide whether a tax is "fairly related to benefits provided the taxpayer", and what deference should the court show to state legislative determinations?  How does the Court determine whether a tax which is facially non-discriminatory should be upheld or struck down?  What level of nexus is required, and how does one determine that a tax is fairly apportioned.  All of these issues belong in an article on the law of local taxation.--&gt;

==Taxation of international commerce==
In addition to satisfying the four-prong test in ''Complete Auto Transit'', the Supreme Court has held state taxes which burden international commerce cannot create a substantial risk of multiple taxations and must not prevent the federal government from "speaking with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments". ''Japan Lines, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles'', 441 U.S. 434 (1979).

In ''Kraft Gen. Foods, Inc. v. Iowa Dept. of Revenue and Finance'', 505 U.S. 71 (1992), the Supreme Court considered a case in which Iowa taxed dividends from foreign subsidiaries, without allowing a credit for taxes paid to foreign governments, but not dividends from domestic subsidiaries operating outside Iowa. This differential treatment arose from Iowa's adoption of the definition of "net income" used by the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. For federal income tax purposes, dividends from domestic subsidiaries are allowed to be exempted from the parent corporations income to avoid double taxation. The Iowa Supreme Court rejected a Commerce Clause claim because Kraft failed to show "that Iowa businesses receive a commercial advantage over foreign commerce due to Iowa's taxing scheme." Considering an Equal Protection Clause challenge, the Iowa Supreme Court held that the use of the federal government's definitions of income were convenient for the state and was "rationally related to the goal of administrative efficiency". The Supreme Court rejected the notion that administrative convenience was a sufficient defense for subjecting foreign commerce to a higher tax burden than interstate commerce. The Supreme Court held that "a State's preference for domestic commerce over foreign commerce is inconsistent with the Commerce Clause even if the State's own economy is not a direct beneficiary of the discrimination."

==Local processing requirements==
Discrimination in the flow of interstate commerce has arisen in a variety of contexts. A line of important cases has dealt with local processing requirements.  Under the local processing requirement, a municipality seeks to force the local processing of raw materials before they are shipped in interstate commerce.

===No local processing preference===
The basic idea of the local processing ordinance was to provide favored access to local processors of locally produced raw materials.  Examples of Supreme Court decisions in this vein are set out in its Carbone decision.  They include ''[[Minnesota v. Barber]]'', 136 U.S. 313, (1890) (striking down a Minnesota statute that required any meat sold within the State, whether originating within or without the State, to be examined by an inspector within the State);  ''[[Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel]]'', 278 U.S. 1 (1928) (striking down a Louisiana statute that forbade shrimp to be exported unless the heads and hulls had first been removed within the State);  ''[[Johnson v. Haydel]]'', 278 U.S. 16 (1928) (striking down analogous Louisiana statute for oysters);  ''[[Toomer v. Witsell]]'', 334 U.S. 385 (1948) (striking down South Carolina statute that required shrimp fishermen to unload, pack, and stamp their catch before shipping it to another State);  ''[[Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.]]'', supra  (striking down Arizona statute that required all Arizona-grown cantaloupes to be packaged within the State prior to export);  ''[[South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke]]'', 467 U.S. 82 (1984) (striking down an Alaska regulation that required all Alaska timber to be processed within the State prior to export).   The Court has defined "protectionist" state legislation as "regulatory measures designed to benefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors". ''New Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach'', 486 U.S. 269, 273&amp;ndash;74 (1988).

===Carbone: local processing law benefiting private entity===
{{Main|C&amp;A Carbone, Inc. v. Town of Clarkstown, New York}}

In the 1980s, spurred by [[RCRA]]'s emphasis on comprehensive local planning, many states and municipalities sought to promote investment in more costly disposal technologies, such as [[waste-to-energy]] incinerators, state-of-the-art landfills, composting and recycling.   Some states and localities sought to promote private investment in these costly technologies by guaranteeing a longterm supply of customers.  See Phillip Weinberg, Congress, the Courts, and Solid Waste Transport:  Good Fences Don't Always Make Good Neighbors, 25 Envtl. L. 57 (1995); Atlantic Coast Demolition &amp; Recycling, Inc., 112 F.3d 652, 657 (3d Cir. 1997).  For about a decade, the use of regulation to channel private commerce to designated private disposal sites was greatly restricted as the result of the Carbone decision discussed below.

Flow control laws typically came in various designs.   One common theme was the decision to fund local infrastructure by guaranteeing a minimum volume of business for privately constructed landfills, incinerators, composters or other costly disposal sites.    In some locales, choice of the flow control device was driven by state bonding laws, or municipal finance concerns.    If a county or other municipality issued general obligation bonds for construction of a costly incinerator, for example, state laws might require a special approval process.  If approval could be obtained, the bonds themselves would be counted against governmental credit limitations, or might impact the governmental body's credit rating: in either instance the ability to bond for other purposes might be impaired.  But by guaranteeing customers for a privately constructed and financed facility, a private entity could issue its own bonds, privately, on the strength of the public's waste assurance.

The private character of flow control regimens can thus be explained in part by the desire to utilize particular kinds of public financing devices.  It can also be explained by significant encouragement at the national level, in national legislation as well as in federal executive policy to achieve environmental objectives utilizing private resources.    Ironically, these public-private efforts often took the form of local processing requirements which ultimately ran afoul of the commerce clause.

The Town of Clarkstown had decided that it wanted to promote waste assurance through a local private transfer station.  The transfer station would process waste and then forward the waste to the disposal site designated by the Town.    The ordinance had the following features:

Waste hauling in the Town of Clarkstown was accomplished by private haulers, subject to local regulation.  The scheme had the following aspects: (A) The Town promoted the financing of a privately owned transfer station through a waste assurance agreement with the private company.     Thus the designated facility was a private company. (B) The Town of Clarkstown forced private haulers to bring their solid waste for local processing at the designated transfer station, even if the ultimate destination of solid waste was an out-of-state disposal site. (C) The primary rationale for forcing in-state waste into the designated private transfer station was financial; it was seen as a device to raise revenue to finance the transfer station.

The Town of Clarkstown's ordinance was designed and written right in the teeth of the long line of Supreme Court cases which had historically struck down local processing requirements. In short, it was as if the authors of the ordinance had gone to a treatise on the commerce clause and intentionally chosen a device which had been traditionally prohibited. A long line of Supreme Court case law had struck down local processing requirements when applied to goods or services in interstate commerce.  As the Court in Carbone wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We consider a so-called flow control ordinance, which requires all solid waste to be processed at a designated transfer station before leaving the municipality.   The avowed purpose of the ordinance is to retain the processing fees charged at the transfer station to amortize the cost of the facility. Because it attains this goal by depriving competitors, including out-of-state firms, of access to a local market, we hold that the flow control ordinance violates the Commerce Clause.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court plainly regarded the decision as a relatively unremarkable decision, not a bold stroke.  As the Court wrote: "The case decided today, while perhaps a small new chapter in that course of decisions, rests nevertheless upon well-settled principles of our Commerce Clause jurisprudence."  And, the Court made it plain, that the problem with Clarkstown's ordinance was that it created a local processing requirement protective of a local private processing company:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this light, the flow control ordinance is just one more instance of local processing requirements that we long have held invalid ... The essential vice in laws of this sort is that they bar the import of the processing service. Out-of-state meat inspectors, or shrimp hullers, or milk pasteurizers, are deprived of access to local demand for their services.  Put another way, the offending local laws hoard a local resource&amp;mdash;be it meat, shrimp, or milk&amp;mdash;for the benefit of local businesses that treat it. 511 U.S. at 392&amp;ndash;393.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===United Haulers: local processing law benefiting public entity===
{{main|United Haulers Association v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority}}

The Court's 2007 decision in ''[[United Haulers Association v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Management Authority]]'' starkly illustrates the difference in result when the Court finds that local regulation is not discriminatory.  The Court dealt with a flow control regimen quite similar to that considered in Carbone.   The "only salient difference is that the laws at issue here require haulers to bring waste to facilities owned and operated by a state-created public benefit corporation."  The Court decided that the balancing test should apply, because the regulatory scheme favored the government owned facility, but treated all private facilities equally.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Compelling reasons justify treating these laws differently from laws favoring particular private businesses over their competitors. "Conceptually, of course, any notion of discrimination assumes a comparison of substantially similar entities." ''[[General Motors Corp. v. Tracy]]'', 519 U.S. 278 (1997). But States and municipalities are not private businesses&amp;mdash;far from it. Unlike private enterprise, government is vested with the responsibility of protecting the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens. See ''[[Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts]]'', 471 U.S. 724 (1985) ... These important responsibilities set state and local government apart from a typical private business.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court's United Haulers decision demonstrates an understanding of the regulatory justifications for flow control starkly missing in the Carbone decision:

&lt;blockquote&gt;By the 1980s, the Counties confronted what they could credibly call a solid waste " 'crisis.' "... Many local landfills were operating without permits and in violation of state regulations. Sixteen were ordered to close and remediate the surrounding environment, costing the public tens of millions of dollars. These environmental problems culminated in a federal clean-up action against a landfill in Oneida County; the defendants in that case named over local businesses and several municipalities and school districts as third-party defendants The "crisis" extended beyond health and safety concerns. The Counties had an uneasy relationship with local waste management companies, enduring price fixing, pervasive overcharging, and the influence of organized crime. Dramatic price hikes were not uncommon: In 1986, for example, a county contractor doubled its waste disposal rate on six weeks' notice&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Court would not interfere with local government's efforts to solve an important public and safety problem.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The contrary approach of treating public and private entities the same under the dormant Commerce Clause would lead to unprecedented and unbounded interference by the courts with state and local government. The dormant Commerce Clause is not a roving license for federal courts to decide what activities are appropriate for state and local government to undertake, and what activities must be the province of private market competition. In this case, the citizens of Oneida and Herkimer Counties have chosen the government to provide waste management services, with a limited role for the private sector in arranging for transport of waste from the curb to the public facilities. The citizens could have left the entire matter for the private sector, in which case any regulation they undertook could not discriminate against interstate commerce. But it was also open to them to vest responsibility for the matter with their government, and to adopt flow control ordinances to support the government effort. It is not the office of the Commerce Clause to control the decision of the voters on whether government or the private sector should provide waste management services. "The Commerce Clause significantly limits the ability of States and localities to regulate or otherwise burden the flow of interstate commerce, but it does not elevate free trade above all other values."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Health and safety regulation==
The history of commerce clause jurisprudence evidences a distinct difference in approach where the state is seeking to exercise its public health and safety powers, on the one hand, as opposed to attempting to regulate the flow of commerce. The exact dividing line between the two interests, the right of states to exercise regulatory control over their public health and safety, and the interest of the national government in unfettered interstate commerce is not always easy to discern.  One Court has written as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not surprisingly, the Court's effort to preserve a national market has, on numerous occasions, come into conflict with the states' traditional power to "legislat[e] on all subjects relating to the health, life, and safety of their citizens."  ''[[Huron Portland Cement Co. v. City of Detroit]]'', 362 U.S. 440, 443 (1960).  On these occasions, the Supreme Court has "struggled (to put it nicely) to develop a set of rules by which we may preserve a national market without needlessly intruding upon the States' police powers, each exercise of which no doubt has some effect on the commerce of the Nation."  ''[[Camps Newfound/Owatonna v. Town of Harrison]]'', 520 U.S. 564, 596 (1997) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citing ''[[Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Jefferson Lines]]'', 514 U.S. 175, 180&amp;ndash;83 (1995));  see generally [[Boris I. Bittker]], Regulation of Interstate and Foreign Commerce § 6.01[A], at 6&amp;ndash;5 ("[T]he boundaries of the [State's] off-limits area are, and always have been, enveloped in a haze."). Those rules are "simply stated, if not simply applied."  Camps Newfound/Owatonna, 520 U.S. at 596 (Scalia, J., dissenting).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A frequently cited example of the deference afforded to the powers of state and local government may be found in ''[[Exxon Corp. v. Maryland]]'', 437 U.S. 117 (1978), where the State of Maryland barred producers of petroleum products from operating retail service stations in the state. It is difficult to imagine a regimen which might have greater impact on the way in which markets are organized.  Yet, the Court found the legislation constitutionally permitted: "The fact that the burden of a state regulation falls on some interstate companies does not, by itself establish a claim of discrimination against interstate commerce," the Court wrote.  The "Clause protects interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations."

Similarly, in ''[[Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co.]]'', 449 U.S. 456 (1981) the Court upheld a state law that banned nonreturnable milk containers made of plastic but permitted other nonreturnable milk containers.  The Court found that the existence of a burden on out-of-state plastic industry was not 'clearly excessive' in comparison to the state's interest in promoting conservation.  And the court continued:

In Exxon, the Court stressed that the Commerce Clause protects the interstate market, not particular interstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations.  A nondiscriminatory regulation serving substantial state purpose is not invalid simply because it causes some business to shift from a predominantly out-of-state industry to a predominantly in-state industry.  Only if the burden on interstate commerce clearly outweighs the State's legitimate purpose does such a regulation violate the commerce clause.  When a state statute regarding safety matters applies equally to interstate and intrastate commerce, the courts are generally reluctant to invalidate it even if it may have some impact on interstate commerce.  In ''[[Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines]]'' 359 U.S. 520, 524 (1959), the United States Supreme Court stated: 'These safety measures carry a strong presumption of validity when challenged in court.  If there are alternative ways of solving a problem, we do not sit to determine which of them is best suited to achieve a valid state objective.   Policy decisions are for the state legislature, absent federal entry into the field.  Unless we can conclude on the whole record that "the total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight or problematical as not to outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free from interferences which seriously impede it"  we must uphold the statute.

==Exceptions==
There are two notable exceptions to the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine that can permit state laws or actions that otherwise violate the Dormant Commerce Clause to survive court challenges.

===Congressional authorization===
The first exception occurs when Congress has legislated on the matter. See ''[[Western &amp; Southern Life Ins. v. State Board of California]]'', {{ussc|451|648|1981}}. In this case the Dormant Commerce Clause is no longer "dormant" and the issue is a Commerce Clause issue, requiring a determination of whether Congress has approved, preempted, or left untouched the state law at issue.

===Market participation exception===
The second exception is "[[market participation exception]]". This occurs when the state is acting "in the market", like a business or customer, rather than as a "market regulator".&lt;ref&gt;''[[South-Central Timber Dev., Inc. v. Wunnicke]]'', 467 U.S. 82, 87 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when a state is contracting for the construction of a building or selling maps to state parks, rather than passing laws governing construction or dictating the price of state park maps, it is acting "in the market".  Like any other business in such cases, a state may favor or shun certain customers or suppliers.

The Supreme Court introduced the market participant doctrine in  ''[[Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp.]]'', 426 U.S. 794 (1976), which upheld a Maryland program that offered bounties to scrap processors to destroy abandoned automobile hulks. See also ''[[Wisconsin Dep't of Indus., Labor &amp; Human Relations v. Gould Inc.]]'', 475 U.S. 282, 289 (1986); ''[[Reeves, Inc. v. Stake]]'', 447 U.S. 429, 437 (1980).  Because Maryland required out-of-state processors, but not in-state processors, to submit burdensome documentation to claim their bounties, the state effectively favored in-state processors over out-of-state processors. The Court held that because the state was merely attaching conditions to its expenditure of state funds, the Maryland program affected the market no differently than if Maryland were a private company bidding up the price of auto hulks.  Because the state was not "regulating" the market, its economic activity was not subject to the anti-discrimination principles underlying the dormant Commerce Clause&amp;mdash;and the state could impose different paperwork burdens on out-of-state processors. "Nothing in the purposes animating the Commerce Clause prohibits a State, in the absence of congressional action, from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others."

Another important case is ''[[White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc.]]'', in which the Supreme Court held that the City of Boston could require its building contractors to hire at least fifty percent of their workforce from among Boston residents.  460 U.S. at 214&amp;ndash;15. Because all of the employees covered by that mandate were "in a substantial if informal sense, 'working for the city,' " Boston was considered to be simply favoring its own residents through the expenditures of municipal funds.  The Supreme Court stated, "when a state or local government enters the market as a participant it is not subject to the restraints of the Commerce Clause." Id. at 208.  Nothing in the Constitution precludes a local government from hiring a local company precisely because it is local.

Other important cases enunciating the market participation exception principle are ''[[Reeves, Inc. v. Stake]]'', {{ussc|447|429|1980}} and ''[[South-Central Timber Development, Inc. v. Wunnicke]]'', {{ussc|467|82|1984}}. The ''Reeves'' case outlines the market participation exception test. In this case state-run cement co-ops were allowed to make restrictive rules (e.g. rules not to sell out-of-state). Here, this government-sponsored business was acting restrictively like an individually owned business and this action was held to be constitutional. ''South-Central Timber'' is important because it limits the market exception. ''South-Central Timber'' holds that the market-participant doctrine is limited in allowing a State to impose burdens on commerce within the market in which it is a participant, but allows it to go no further. The State may not impose conditions that have a substantial regulatory effect outside of that particular market.

The "market participation exception" to the dormant Commerce Clause does not give states unlimited authority to favor local interests, because limits from other laws and Constitutional limits still apply.  In ''[[United Building &amp; Construction Trades Council v. Camden]]'', {{ussc|465|208|1984}}, the city of [[Camden, New Jersey]] had passed an ordinance requiring that at least forty percent of the employees of contractors and subcontractors on city projects be Camden residents. The Supreme Court found that while the law was not infirm because of the Dormant Commerce Clause, it violated the [[Privileges and Immunities Clause]] of [[Article Four of the United States Constitution|Article IV]] of the Constitution. Justice Rehnquist's opinion distinguishes the market-participant doctrine from the privileges and immunities doctrine.  Similarly, Congress has the power itself under the Commerce Clause to regulate and sanction states acting as "market participants", but it lacks power to legislate in ways that violate Article IV.

In the 21st century, the dormant Commerce Clause has been a frequent legal issue in cases arising under state laws regulating some aspects of Internet activity. Because of the interstate, and often international, nature of Internet communications, state laws addressing internet-related subjects such as [[spam (electronic)|spam]], online sales or online pornography can often trigger Dormant Commerce Clause issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldsmith |first=Jack L. |authorlink= |author2=Sykes, Alan O. |year=2001 |title=The Internet and the Dormant Commerce Clause |journal=Yale Law Journal |volume=110 |issue=5 |pages=785&amp;ndash;828 |doi=10.2307/797608 |jstor= 797608|quote= |publisher=The Yale Law Journal Company, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the doctrine==
A "negative" or "dormant" component to the Commerce Clause has been the subject of scholarly discussion for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;FELIX FRANKFURTER, THE COMMERCE CLAUSE UNDER MARSHALL, TANEY AND WAITE 12 (1937) (describing absence of comment during drafting and ratification of Constitution regarding possible negative implications of Commerce Clause); Albert S. Abel, The Commerce Clause in the Constitutional Convention and in Contemporary Comment, 25 Minn. L. Rev. 432, 493 (1941) (arguing that historical evidence "supports the view that, as to the restricted field which was deemed at the time to constitute regulation of commerce, the grant of power to the federal government presupposed the withdrawal of authority ''pari passu'' from the states.").&lt;/ref&gt;  Both Supreme Court Justices [[Antonin Scalia]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tyler Pipe Industries v. Department of Revenue]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=483&amp;invol=232 483 U.S. 232] (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v. Huddleston]]'', 507 U.S. 60(1993) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (concurring in enforcement of dormant Commerce Clause on stare decisis grounds)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clarence Thomas]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[United Haulers Assn. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth.]]'', [http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/05-1345_All.pdf 550 U.S. ___] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; have rejected the notion of a Dormant Commerce Clause.  They believe that such a doctrine is inconsistent with an [[Originalism|originalist]] interpretation of the Constitution—so much so that they believe the doctrine is a "judicial fraud".&lt;ref name=Wynne /&gt;

A number of earlier Supreme Court justices also expressed dissatisfaction with the dormant Commerce Clause doctrine.  For example, [[Roger Taney|Chief Justice Taney]] said this in 1847:&lt;ref&gt;License Cases (Thurlow v. Massachusetts; Fletcher v. Rhode Island; Peirce v. New Hampshire), [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=46&amp;invol=504 46 U.S. 504 (1847)].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it was intended to forbid the States from making any regulations of commerce, it is difficult to account for the omission to prohibit it, when that prohibition has been so carefully and distinctly inserted in relation to other powers ... [T]he legislation of Congress and the States has conformed to this construction from the foundation of the government ... The decisions of this court will also, in my opinion, when carefully examined, be found to sanction the construction I am maintaining.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, that statement by Taney in 1847 was before the doctrine morphed in the 1851 case of ''[[Cooley v. Board of Wardens]]'', in which Justice [[Benjamin R. Curtis]] wrote for the Court that the Commerce Clause does not always require "exclusive legislation by Congress".&lt;ref name=Cooley /&gt;

==Puerto Rico==
In ''Trailer Marine Transport Corp. v. Rivera Vázquez'', 977 F.2d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 1992), the [[First Circuit]] held that the dormant Commerce Clause applies to [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/977/1/305484/ 977 F.2d 1: Trailer Marine Transport Corp., Plaintiff, Appellee, v. Carmen M. Rivera Vazquez, Etc., et al., Defendants, Appellants]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''duck test''' is a form of [[abductive reasoning]]. This is its usual expression: 
{{quote|If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably ''is'' a duck.}}
The test implies that a person can identify an unknown subject by observing that subject's habitual characteristics. It is sometimes used to counter [[wikt:abstruse|abstruse]], or even valid, arguments that something is not what it appears to be.

== History ==
[[Indiana]] poet [[James Whitcomb Riley]] (1849–1916) may have coined the phrase when he wrote:
{{quote|When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heim|first=Michael |title=Exploring Indiana Highways  |pages=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j7zds6xx7S0C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=%22james+Riley%22+OR+%22James+Whitcomb+Riley%22+bird++duck&amp;num=100| isbn=978-0-9744358-3-1 | year=2007 | publisher=Exploring America's Highway}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A common variation of the wording of the phrase may have originated much later with Emil Mazey, secretary-treasurer of the [[United Auto Workers]], at a labor meeting in 1946 accusing a person of being a communist:

{{quote|I can’t prove you are a Communist. But when I see a bird that quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, has feathers and webbed feet and associates with ducks—I’m certainly going to assume that he ''is'' a duck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Milwaukee (WI) Sentinel|title=Communist Expose  The Case of the Duck|date=September 29, 1946|author=Sentinel, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term was later popularized in the United States by [[Richard Cunningham Patterson Jr.]], [[Ambassadors from the United States|United States ambassador]] to [[Guatemala]] in 1950 during the [[Cold War]], who used the phrase when he accused the [[Jacobo Arbenz Guzmán]] government of being [[Communist]]. Patterson explained his reasoning as follows:

{{quote|Suppose you see a bird walking around in a farm yard. This bird has no label that says 'duck'. But the bird certainly looks like a duck. Also, he goes to the pond and you notice that he swims like a duck. Then he opens his beak and quacks like a duck. Well, by this time you have probably reached the conclusion that the bird is a duck, whether he's wearing a label or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|given=Richard H.|surname=Immerman|year=1982|title=The [[CIA]] in Guatemala: The Foreign Policy of Intervention|page=102|publisher=[[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas Press]]|place=[[Austin, Texas]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Later references to the duck test include Cardinal [[Richard Cushing]]'s, who used the phrase in 1964 in reference to [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first1=Joseph|last1=Denver|author2=Ethel Franklin Betts|year=1965|title=Cushing of Boston: A Candid Portrait|publisher=|place=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Platt|first=Suzy |title=Respectfully quoted|publisher=[[Library of Congress]], Congressional Research Service|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Tu3bScwKKAC&amp;pg=PT267&amp;dq=%22when+I+see+a+bird+that+walks+like+a+duck+and+swims%22&amp;ei=eL3cSYazBJKqMpG_6bMO | isbn=978-0-88029-768-4}} ''"Attributed to Richard Cardinal Cushing. Everett Dirksen and Herbert V. Prochnow, Quotation Finder, p. 55 (1971). Unverified."''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Douglas Adams]] parodied this test in his book ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'':
{{quote|If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, we have at least to consider the possibility that we have a small aquatic bird of the family [[Anatidae]] on our hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Douglas|title=Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A claimed recent application of the duck test was the denial of tax exempt "nonprofit" status to [[Blue Shield of California]].{{efn-ua|"In a startling blow to one of California's biggest health insurers, the state has revoked the tax-exempt status of Blue Shield of California, forcing the company to pay tens of millions of dollars in back taxes and unleashing a torrent of calls for it to return billions of dollars to customers. 
The tax board's action 'was an acknowledgment of what Blue Shield was already doing, or not doing,' said Anthony Wright, head of Health Access California, a consumer advocacy group. 'And if it looks like a duck and talks like a duck, it should be taxed like a duck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=California drops hammer on Blue Shield tax-exempt status

The [[Liskov Substitution Principle]] in computer science is sometimes expressed as a counter-example to the duck test:
{{quote|If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck but it needs batteries, you probably have the wrong [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Derick|last=Bailey|title=SOLID Development Principles – In Motivational Pictures|url=http://lostechies.com/derickbailey/2009/02/11/solid-development-principles-in-motivational-pictures/}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Sergey Lavrov]] used a version of the Duck Test in 2015 in response to allegations that Russian airstrikes in Syria were not targeting terrorist groups, primarily [[ISIS]], but rather West-supported groups such as the Free Syrian Army. When asked to elaborate his definition of 'terrorist groups', he replied:
{{quote|If it looks like a terrorist, if it acts like a terrorist, if it walks like a terrorist, if it fights like a terrorist, it's a terrorist, right?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Melvin|first1=Don|last2=Cullinane|first2=Susannah|last3=Tawfeeq|first3=Mohammed|title=Russia's Lavrov on Syria targets: 'If it looks like a terrorist, walks like a terrorist ...'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/01/middleeast/russia-syria/|accessdate=9 July 2016|publisher=CNN|date=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

&lt;!--[[Elephant test]] redirects directly here.--&gt;Similarly, the term '''''elephant test''''' refers to situations in which an idea or thing, "is hard to describe, but instantly recognizable when spotted".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge.ai/Edge-International-1130480.html Valuing and Judging Partners — Beyond the Elephant Test!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603040024/http://www.edge.ai/Edge-International-1130480.html |date=2013-06-03 }}, Edge International Review, Summer 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is often used in legal cases when there is an issue which may be open to interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;B.Wedderburn, The Worker and the Law (3rd ed, Harmondsworth, Penguin,1986), 116.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Barnard, [http://www.jil.go.jp/english/events_and_information/documents/clls04_barnard2.pdf The Personal Scope of the Employment Relationship] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126221317/http://www.jil.go.jp//english/events_and_information/documents/clls04_barnard2.pdf |date=2013-01-26 }}, in T.Araki and S.Ouchi (eds), The Mechanism for establishing and Changing Terms and Conditions of Employment/The Scope of Labor Law and the Notion of Employees, The Japan Institute for Labour Policy and Training Report, 2004, vol.1, 131-136. &lt;/ref&gt; such as in the case of ''Cadogan Estates Ltd v Morris'', when [[Lord Justice]] Stuart-Smith referred  to "the well known elephant test. It is difficult to describe, but you know it when you see it",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1998/1671.html Cadogan Estates Ltd v Morris]; EWCA Civ 1671 (4 November 1998) (at paragraph 17)&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''Ivey v Genting Casinos'', when Lord Hughes (in discussing dishonesty) opined "like the elephant, it is characterised more by recognition when encountered than by definition."  ''Overruling'' in part [[R v Ghosh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2016-0213.html Ivey v Genting Casinos (UK) Ltd t/a Crockfords]; [2017] UKSC 67 (25 Oct 2017) (at paragraph 48)&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar incantation (used however as a rule of exclusion) was invoked by the concurring opinion of Justice [[Potter Stewart]] in ''[[Jacobellis v. Ohio]]'', 378 U.S. 184 (1964), an obscenity case.  He stated that the Constitution protected all obscenity except "hard-core pornography". Stewart opined, "I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced within that shorthand description; and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly doing so. But [[I know it when I see it]], and the motion picture involved in this case is not that."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9250">'''Earning to give''' involves deliberately pursuing a high-earning career for the purpose of donating a significant portion of earned income, typically because of a belief in [[effective altruism]].

Advocates of earning to give sometimes suggest that maximizing the amount one can donate to charity is an important consideration for individuals when deciding what career to pursue, even if the individual has less [[Intrinsic and extrinsic properties|intrinsic]] interest in high-earning careers.&lt;ref name=kristof&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-the-trader-who-donates-half-his-pay.html?_r=0|title = The Trader Who Donates Half His Pay|last= Kristof|first = Nicholas|authorlink = Nicholas Kristof|date = April 4, 2015|accessdate = April 10, 2015|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proponents==
In the 1996 book ''[[Living High and Letting Die]]'', the philosopher [[Peter Unger]] wrote that it was morally praiseworthy and perhaps even morally required for people in academia who could earn substantially greater salaries in the business world to leave academia, earn the greater salaries, and donate most of the extra money to charity.&lt;ref name="Unger"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Unger|first1=Peter|title=Living High and Letting Die|date=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0198026811}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Moral philosopher [[Peter Singer]] has laid the foundations for effective altruism and earning to give in his 1971 essay "[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality|''Famine, Affluence and Morality'']]" and since advocated for donating considerable amounts of one's income to effective charitable organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-singer-on-the-ethics-of-philanthropy-1428083293|title=Peter Singer on the Ethics of Philanthropy|last=Wolfe|first=Alexandra|date=2015-04-03|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-04-04|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer is a public proponent of effective altruism and endorsed earning to give in his 2013 [[TED talk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Singer|first=Peter|title=The why and how of effective altruism|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism|language=en|accessdate=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Associate Professor in Philosophy at Oxford University [[William MacAskill]] promoted earning to give as one possible high impact career in several news articles and in his 2015 book [[Doing Good Better|''Doing Good Better: Effective Altruism and a Radical New Way to Make a Difference'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://qz.com/57254/to-save-the-world-dont-get-a-job-at-a-charity-go-work-on-wall-street/|title=To save the world, don’t get a job at a charity; go work on Wall Street|work=Quartz|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2015/09/10/working-for-a-hedge-fund-could-be-the-most-charitable-thing-you-do/|title=Working for a hedge fund could be the most charitable thing you do|last=MacAskill|first=William|date=2015-09-10|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-04-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|last2=MacAskill|first2=William|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacAskill is the co-founder and president of [[80,000 Hours]], a nonprofit which conducts research on careers with positive social impact and provides career advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/about/meet-the-team/|title=Meet the team - 80,000 Hours|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization recommends earning to give as a career path with a high impact potential for effective altruists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give/|title=Why and how to earn to give - 80,000 Hours|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=2017-04-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/05/31/join-wall-street-save-the-world/|title=Join Wall Street.

Many of the people who practice earning to give consider themselves to be part of the effective altruism community.&lt;ref name=kristof/&gt;&lt;ref name=dailymail&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2334682/Young-professionals-joining-Wall-Street-save-world.html|title = The young professionals who believe their best chance at trying to save the world is by joining Wall Street and making millions|publisher = ''[[Daily Mail]]''|date = June 2, 2013|accessdate = April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacFarquhar|first1=Larissa|title=Strangers Drowning|date=2015|publisher=Penguin|location=London|isbn=1594204330}}&lt;!--|accessdate=20 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some donate up to 50% of their income, more than the 10% required for the basic [[Giving What We Can]] pledge.&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt; They may live frugally to donate more money.&lt;ref name="MacFarquhar" /&gt; Financial careers are popular for those pursuing earning to give.&lt;ref name="dailymail" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt;

==Debate==
[[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] criticized the concept in his ''[[New York Times]]'' opinion column,&lt;ref name=brooks&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?ref=opinion|title = The Way to Produce a Person|last = Brooks|first = David|date = 2013-06-03|accessdate = 2013-10-16|publisher = ''The New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that, while altruists may start doing "earning to give" to realize their deepest commitments, their values may erode over time, becoming progressively less altruistic. In addition, Brooks objected to the view on which altruists should turn themselves "into a machine for the redistribution of wealth." [[Peter Singer]] responded to these criticisms in his book ''The Most Good You Can Do'' by giving examples of people who have been earning to give for years without losing their altruistic motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.yupnet.org/2016/08/09/earning-to-give-leads-to-happiness/|title='Earning to Give' Leads to Happiness|date=2016-08-09|website=Yale Press Log|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; William MacAskill also defended the practice against Brooks' criticisms in ''[[The Washington Post]],'' arguing that even [[Friedrich Engels]] was earning to give to support the work of anti-capitalist [[Karl Marx]] financially.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Dana Goldstein]] has also criticized earning to give, prompting a response from [[Reihan Salam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/agenda/349841/rise-singerians-reihan-salam|title = The Rise of the Singerians|last = Salam|first = Reihan|date = May 31, 2013|accessdate = November 26, 2013|publisher = ''[[National Review]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecstasy''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] ἔκστασις ''ékstasis'') is a subjective experience of total involvement of the subject, with an object of his or her awareness.  In classical Greek literature it refers to removal of the mind or body "from its normal place of function."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|page=505|author=H. S. Versnal|work=The Oxford Classical Dictionary|edition=Third, revised|title=ecstasy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total involvement with an object of interest is not an ordinary experience because of being aware of other objects, thus ecstasy is an example of an [[altered state of consciousness]] characterized by diminished awareness of other objects or the total lack of the awareness of surroundings and everything around the object. The word is also used to refer to any heightened state of consciousness or intensely pleasant experience. It is also used more specifically to denote states of awareness of non-ordinary mental spaces, which may be perceived as [[spirit]]ual (the latter type of ecstasy often takes the form of [[religious ecstasy]]).

==Description==
[[File:Guido Reni - St Filippo Neri in Ecstasy - WGA19295.jpg|thumb|St Filippo Neri in Ecstasy by Guido Reni]] 
From a psychological perspective, ecstasy is a loss of self-control and sometimes a temporary loss of consciousness, which is often associated with religious mysticism, sexual intercourse and the use of certain drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/ecstasy|title=Ecstasy|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For the duration of the ecstasy the ecstatic is out of touch with ordinary life and is capable neither of communication with other people nor of undertaking normal actions. The experience can be brief in physical time, or it can go on for hours. Subjective perception of time, space or self may strongly change or disappear during ecstasy. For instance, if one is concentrating on a physical task, then any intellectual thoughts may cease. On the other hand, making a spirit journey in an ecstatic trance involves the cessation of voluntary bodily movement.

== Types==
[[File:Jean Benner, L'Extase ( Musée d'art moderne et contemporain de Strasbourg ).JPG|thumb|''Ecstasy'', by [[Jean Benner]] ([[Strasbourg Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art]])]]
Ecstasy can be deliberately induced using religious or creative activities, [[meditation]], [[music]], [[ecstatic dance|dancing]], breathing exercises, [[physical exercise]], [[sexual intercourse]] or consumption of [[psychotropic drug]]s. The particular technique that an individual uses to induce ecstasy is usually also associated with that individual's particular [[anthropology of religion|religious]] and [[culture|cultural traditions]]. Sometimes an ecstatic experience takes place due to occasional contact with something or somebody perceived as extremely beautiful or holy, or without any known reason. "In some cases, a person might obtain an ecstatic experience 'by mistake'. Maybe the person unintentionally triggers one of the, probably many, physiological mechanisms through which such an experience can be reached. In such cases, it is not rare to find that the person later, by reading, looks for an interpretation and maybe finds it within a tradition."&lt;ref name="KajBjorkqvist"&gt;{{cite web|first=Kaj |last=Björkqvist |title=Ecstasy from a Physiological Point of View |url=http://www.ex-premie2.org/papers/religious_ecstasy.htm |work=(Scripta Instituti Donneriani Aboensis XI: Religious Ecstasy. Based on Papers read at the Symposium on Religions Ecstasy held at Åbo, Finland, on the 26th-28th of August 1981. Edited by Nils G. Holm. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040914183254/http://www.ex-premie2.org/papers/religious_ecstasy.htm |archivedate=September 14, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People interpret the experience afterward according to their culture and beliefs (as a revelation from God, a trip to the world of spirits or a [[psychosis|psychotic episode]]). "When a person is using an ecstasy technique, he usually does so within a tradition. When he reaches an experience, a traditional interpretation of it already exists."&lt;ref name="KajBjorkqvist" /&gt; The experience together with its subsequent interpretation may strongly and permanently change the value system and the worldview of the subject (e.g. to cause religious conversion).

In 1925, [[James Leuba]] wrote: "Among most uncivilized populations, as among civilized peoples, certain ecstatic conditions are regarded as divine possession or as union with the Divine. These states are induced by means of drugs, by physical excitement, or by psychical means. But, however produced and at whatever level of culture they may be found, they possess certain common features which suggest even to the superficial observer some profound connection. Always described as delightful beyond expression, these awesome ecstatic experiences end commonly in mental quiescence or even in total unconsciousness."  He prepares his readers "... to recognize a continuity of impulse, of purpose, of form and of result between the ecstatic intoxication of the savage and the absorption in God of the Christian mystic."&lt;ref&gt;James H. Leuba, "The Psychology of Religious Mysticism", p.8. Routledge, UK, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

"In everyday language, the word 'ecstasy' denotes an intense, euphoric experience. For obvious reasons, it is rarely used in a scientific context; it is a concept that is extremely hard to define."&lt;ref name="KajBjorkqvist" /&gt;

In [[aerospace engineering]], especially those areas dealing with [[spacecraft]], the '''eigenvector slew''' is a method to calculate a steering correction (called a '''[[Slew (spacecraft)|slew]]''') by rotating the spacecraft around '''one''' fixed axis, or a [[Gimbal|gimbal]].  This corresponds in general to the fastest and most efficient way to reach the desired target orientation as there is only one acceleration phase and one braking phase for the angular rate. If this fixed axis is not a [[Principal axis (mechanics)|principal axis]] a time varying torque must be applied to force the spacecraft to rotate as desired, though. Also the [[Gyroscope|gyroscopic]] effect of [[momentum wheels]] must be compensated for.

That such a rotation exists corresponds precisely to a main result of the mathematical theory of [[Rotation operator (vector space)|rotation operators]], the (only real) [[eigenvector]] of the rotation operator corresponding to the desired re-orientation is this axis.  

Given the current orientation of the craft, and the desired orientation of the craft in [[cartesian coordinates]], the required [[axis of rotation]] and corresponding rotation angle to achieve the new orientation is determined by computing the eigenvector of the [[Rotation operator (vector space)|rotation operator]]. 

== Problem ==
Let

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}\ ,\ \hat{y}\ ,\  \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;

be a body fixed reference system for a [[3 axis stabilized spacecraft]].  The initial attitude
is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}=\hat{a}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{y}=\hat{b}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{z}=\hat{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

One wants to find an axis relative the spacecraft body

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}=r_x \cdot \hat{x} +r_y \cdot \hat{y} +r_z \cdot \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt;

and a rotation angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that after the rotation with the angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; one has that

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{x}=\hat{d}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{y}=\hat{e}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{z}=\hat{f}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{d}\ ,\ \hat{e}\ ,\  \hat{f}&lt;/math&gt;

are the new target directions.

In vector form this means that

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{d}=r_a \cdot \hat{r} + \cos \alpha \cdot ( \hat{a} - r_a \cdot \hat{r})+
 \sin \alpha \cdot \hat{r} \times \hat{a}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{e}=r_b \cdot \hat{r} + \cos \alpha \cdot ( \hat{b} - r_b \cdot \hat{r})+
 \sin \alpha \cdot \hat{r} \times \hat{b}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{f}=r_c \cdot \hat{r} + \cos \alpha \cdot ( \hat{c} - r_c \cdot \hat{r})+
 \sin \alpha \cdot \hat{r} \times \hat{c}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Solution ==

In terms of [[linear algebra]] this means that one wants to find an [[eigenvector]] with the [[eigenvalue]] = 1 for the [[linear map]]ping defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a} \longrightarrow \hat{d}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{b} \longrightarrow \hat{e}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{c} \longrightarrow \hat{f}&lt;/math&gt;

which relative to the 

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\ ,\ \hat{b}\ ,\ \hat{c}&lt;/math&gt;

coordinate system has the matrix

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
\langle \hat{d}| \hat{a}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{e}| \hat{a}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{f}| \hat{a} \rangle \\
\langle\hat{d}| \hat{b}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{e}| \hat{b}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{f}| \hat{b}\rangle \\
\langle\hat{d}| \hat{c}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{e}| \hat{c}\rangle &amp; \langle\hat{f}| \hat{c}\rangle
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Because this is the matrix of the [[Rotation operator (vector space)|rotation operator]] relative the base vector system &lt;math&gt;\hat{a}\ ,\ \hat{b}\ ,\ \hat{c}&lt;/math&gt; the eigenvalue can be determined with the algorithm described in "[[Rotation operator (vector space)]]".

With the notations used here this is:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos \alpha=\frac{\langle\hat{d}| \hat{a}\rangle+\langle\hat{e}| \hat{b}\rangle+\langle\hat{f}| \hat{c}\rangle-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_a=\langle\hat{f}| \hat{b}\rangle-\langle\hat{e}| \hat{c}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_b=\langle\hat{d}| \hat{c}\rangle-\langle\hat{f}| \hat{a}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;r_c=\langle\hat{e}| \hat{a}\rangle-\langle\hat{d}| \hat{b}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|\bar{r}|=\sqrt{{r_a}^2+{r_b}^2+{r_c}^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \alpha=\frac{|\bar{r}|}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The rotation angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\operatorname{arg}(\cos \alpha,\sin \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

where "&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{arg}(x\ ,\ y)&lt;/math&gt;" is the polar argument of the vector &lt;math&gt;(\ x\ ,\ y\ )&lt;/math&gt; corresponding to the function [[Atan2|ATAN2(y,x)]] (or in [[double precision]] DATAN2(y,x)) available in for example the programming language [[Fortran|FORTRAN]].

The resulting &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; will be in the interval &lt;math&gt;0 \le \alpha \le \pi&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;0 &lt; \alpha &lt; \pi&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|\bar{r}| &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and the uniquely defined rotation (unit) vector is:

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{r}=\frac{\bar{r}}{|\bar{r}|}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that
 
:&lt;math&gt;\langle\hat{d}| \hat{a}\rangle +\langle\hat{e}| \hat{b}\rangle+\langle\hat{f}| \hat{c}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Trace (linear algebra)|trace]] of the matrix defined by the orthogonal linear mapping and that the components of the "[[eigenvector]]" are fixed and constant during the rotation, i.e.
 
:&lt;math&gt;
\hat{r}=r_x \cdot \hat{x}(t) +r_y \cdot \hat{y}(t) +r_z \cdot \hat{z}(t)=
r_x \cdot \hat{a} +r_y \cdot \hat{b} +r_z \cdot \hat{c}=
r_x \cdot \hat{d} +r_y \cdot \hat{e} +r_z \cdot \hat{f}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}\ ,\ \hat{y}\ ,\ \hat{z}&lt;/math&gt; are moving with time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; during the slew.

'''''From Dictatorship to Democracy, A Conceptual Framework for Liberation''''' is a book-length essay on the generic problem of how to destroy a dictatorship and to prevent the rise of a new one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeinstein.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FDTD.pdf ''From Dictatorship to Democracy''], 4th U.S. Ed., p viii.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was written in 1993 by [[Gene Sharp]] (b. 1928), a professor of political science at the [[University of Massachusetts Dartmouth|University of Massachusetts]]. The book has been published in many countries worldwide and translated into more than 30 languages. Editions in many languages are also published by the [[Albert Einstein Institution]] of Boston, Massachusetts. {{as of|2012}} its current primary English-language edition is the Fourth United States Edition, published in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeinstein.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/FDTD.pdf ''''' From Dictatorship to Democracy'''''], 4th U.S. Ed., p iv.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has been circulated worldwide and cited repeatedly as influencing movements such as the [[Arab Spring]] of 2010–2012.&lt;ref name=cnn2012_06_23/&gt;&lt;ref name=dailytimes2012_06_01/&gt;&lt;ref name=ft2012_06_25/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes2012_06_11/&gt;

==Origin==
{{Gene Sharp}}
''From Dictatorship to Democracy'' (''FDTD'') was written in 1993 at the request of a prominent exiled [[Politics of Burma|Burmese]] democrat, Tin Maung Win, who was then editor of ''Khit Pyaing'' (The New Era Journal), in
[[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name=fdtdhistapp2&gt;The history of ''FDTD'' is discussed at length in Appendix 2 of the 4th US edition of ''FDTD'', "Acknowledgements and Notes on the History of From Dictatorship to Democracy" (pp. 87-90), available for download at the [[Albert Einstein Institution]] website [http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations98ce.html HERE.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621020453/http://www.aeinstein.org/organizations98ce.html |date=2012-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|87–8}} The book took several months to write as the author drew upon several decades of experience in scholarship on nonviolent action.&lt;ref name=fdtdhistapp2/&gt;{{rp|87}}&lt;ref name=fdtdhist_sepdoc/&gt;
''FDTD'' was first published in 1993 as installments in [[Burmese language|Burmese]] and English in ''Khit Pyaing''. In 1994, it was issued as a booklet in both English and Burmese.&lt;ref name=fdtdhistapp2/&gt;{{rp|88}} Since that time, there have been several additional English-language editions and translations into more than 30 additional languages.

==Topics covered==
''From Dictatorship to Democracy'' contains a preface and ten sections.  Its first appendix includes 198 ''Methods Of Nonviolent Action'' that were taken from Gene Sharp's ''[[The Politics of Nonviolent Action]]'' (1973), Part Two, ''The Methods of Nonviolent Action''. The main sections of the 4th US edition are entitled:
:1. Facing Dictatorships Realistically
:2. The Dangers of Negotiations
:3. Whence Comes the Power?
:4. Dictatorships Have Weaknesses
:5. Exercising Power
:6. The Need for Strategic Planning
:7. Planning Strategy
:8. Applying Political Defiance
:9. Disintegrating the Dictatorship
:10. Groundwork for Durable Democracy
Three appendices are included in the fourth US edition of ''FDTD'':
:Appendix 1. The Methods of Nonviolent Action
:Appendix 2. Acknowledgements and Notes on the History of ''From Dictatorship to Democracy''
:Appendix 3. A Note About Translations and Reprinting of this Publication
:For Further Reading
Appendix 3 gives a step-by-step procedure for effectively translating ''FDTD'' into other languages.

We usually do not know how awareness of this publication has spread from country to country."&lt;ref name=fdtdhistapp2/&gt;{{rp|88–9}}

A [[CNN]] profile of Sharp in 2012 stated that ''FDTD'' had "spread like a virus," calling it a "viral pamphlet."&lt;ref name=cnn2012_06_23/&gt; The book "started life in [[Myanmar]] as incendiary advice printed on a few sheets of paper and surreptitiously exchanged by activists living under a military dictatorship." Later it "took on a life of its own... eventually, some say, inspiring the uprisings known as the [[Arab Spring]]."&lt;ref name=cnn2012_06_23/&gt;

The Pakistani ''[[Daily Times (Pakistan)|Daily Times]]'' stated that ''FDTD'' "has had an impact on the Arabic-speaking world even though the setting is in a non-Arabic world."&lt;ref name=dailytimes2012_06_01/&gt;

The ''[[Financial Times]]'', in discussing the prospects for dictators worldwide, described Sharp as "the [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] of the new [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi-ism]]" stating that
&lt;blockquote&gt;
What is new... is the wildfire spread of systematically non-violent insurgency. This owes a great deal to the strategic thinking of Gene Sharp, an American academic whose how-to-topple-your-tyrant manual, ''From Dictatorship to Democracy'', is the bible of activists from Belgrade to Rangoon.&lt;ref name=ft2012_06_25/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[BBC]] reported in 2004 that ''FDTD'' "was used practically as a textbook" in lectures attended by members of [[Otpor!]], the [[Serbs|Serbian]] resistance movement, in the year 2000.&lt;ref name=bbc2004&gt;[[BBC]] (29 November 2004).

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in 2011 that ''From Dictatorship to Democracy'' had been posted by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] on its website during the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/world/middleeast/17sharp.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all|title= Shy U.S. Intellectual Created Playbook Used in a Revolution|date=December 16, 2011 |work= New York Times |accessdate=18 December 2011 |first=Sheryl Gay|last=Stolberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that ''FDTD'' was "available for download in more than two dozen languages" (and provided a link), while describing Sharp as a "leading [advocate] of grass-roots democracy."&lt;ref name=nytimes2012_06_11/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3404">'''Gamma-Re (γ-Re) transition model''' is a two equation [[Mathematical model|model]] used in [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] (CFD) to modify turbulent transport equations to simulate [[laminar flow|laminar]], laminar-to-turbulent and turbulence states in a fluid flow. The Gamma-Re model does not intend to model the physics of the problem but attempts to fit a wide range of experiments and transition methods into its formulation. The transition model calculated an [[intermittency]] factor that creates (or [[extinguish|extinguishes]]) turbulence by slowly introducing turbulent production at the laminar-to-turbulent transition location.

[[File:Gamma-Theta Intermittency Values of a Turbomachinery Blade.png|thumb|right|Intermittency Value on a Turbomachinery blade]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/opus/volltexte/2006/2801/pdf/Kap01_05_1.pdf]; R.B. Langtry. A Correlation-Based Transition Model using Local Variables for Unstructured Parallelized CFD Code. University of Stuttgart, PhD Thesis. May 31, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principle==
The goal of developing the gamma-Re (&lt;math&gt; \gamma - \mathrm{Re}_{\theta_t} &lt;/math&gt;) transition model was to develop a transition model based on local variables which could be easily implemented into modern [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] code with unstructured grids and massive parallel execution. The majority of earlier transition models such as the &lt;math&gt; e^{n} &lt;/math&gt; model needs to know the structure of the boundary layer and the integration along it; both concepts are hard to implement in three dimensions along many subdivisions of a grid. Another key insight to the formulation of this model is that the Reynolds vorticity number can be related to the Reynolds transition onset number so there is a local way to determine the transition location. The gamma-Re transition model has two equations and is based on the two-equation turbulence models in the context of [[turbulence modeling]].  This way both local and global trends can be modelled.  The intermittency or gamma determines the percentage of time the flow is turbulent (0 = fully laminar, 1 = fully turbulent).  The intermittency acts on the production term of the turbulent kinetic energy transport equation in the [[SST (Menter’s Shear Stress Transport)|SST]] model to simulate laminar/turbulence flows.

==Standard Gamma-Theta model==

For intermittency  &lt;math&gt; \gamma &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{ \partial (\rho \gamma) }{\partial t} + \frac{\partial(\rho U_j \gamma)}{ \partial x_j} = P_{\gamma} - E_{\gamma} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left[\left(\mu+\frac{\mu_f}{\sigma_f}\right)\frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial x_j} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

For Transition Momentum Thickness Reynolds Number  &lt;math&gt;Re_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{ \partial (\rho \overline{Re_{\theta t}}) }{\partial t} + \frac{\partial(\rho U_j  \overline{Re_{\theta t}})}{ \partial x_j} = P_{\theta t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left[\sigma_{\theta t}(\mu + \mu_t )\frac{\partial \overline{Re_{\theta t}}}{\partial x_j} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

{{About||the arguments in political science theory|greed versus grievance|issues related to labour disputes|Grievance (labour)}}

In general, '''grievance''' (from class. lat. ''gravis'': heavy) is a [[wrong]] or [[wikt:hardship|hardship]] suffered, real or supposed, which forms legitimate grounds of [[complaint]]. In the past, the word meant [[Oppression|oppressive]] state of things.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt of English barons in the early thirteenth century which led to the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 was partly motivated by grievances against abuses by [[John of England|King John]]. This right to [[Petition]] the king, for grievances, was affirmed in the [[Bill of Rights 1689]]

The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] is mainly an enumeration of the colonists' grievances against [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="86674">[[File:CincinnatiCustomsHouse.jpg|thumb|300px|[[United States Custom House and Post Office (Cincinnati)|Cincinnati Customs House]] {{circa}} 1850–60&lt;br&gt;Governments were one of the earliest users of weights and measures – often for the purpose of tax collection.  In the United States the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Treasury]] rather than [[United States Congress|Congress]] took the lead in establishing a standard [[system of weights and measures]].]]

The [[imperial units|imperial system of measurement]] and the [[United States customary units|US customary system of measurement]] are both derived from an earlier [[English units|English system of measurement]] which in turn can be traced back to [[Ancient Roman units of measurement]], and [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] and [[Saxons|Saxon]] units of measure.

The US Customary system of units was developed and used in the United States after the [[American Revolution]], based on a subset of the English units used in the [[Thirteen Colonies]].  The Imperial system of units was developed and used in the United Kingdom beginning in 1826, and subsequently used in the rest of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. US Customary units are the predominant system of units in the United States, but the [[metric system]] has, to varying degrees, replaced the imperial system in all Commonwealth countries.

Most of the units of measure have been adopted in one way or another since the [[Norman Conquest]] (1066). The units of linear measure have changed the least – the [[yard]] (which replaced the [[ell]]) and the [[chain (unit)|chain]] were measures derived in England. The [[foot (unit)|foot]] used by craftsman supplanted the longer foot used in agriculture.  The agricultural foot was reduced to {{fract|10|11}} of its former size, causing the [[Rod (unit)|rod, pole or perch]] to become {{fract|16|1|2}} (rather than the older 15) agricultural feet.  The [[furlong]] and the [[acre]], once it became a measure of the size of a piece of land rather than its value, remained relatively unchanged. In the last thousand years, three principal pounds were used in England. The [[troy pound]] (5760 [[grain (unit)|grains]]) was used for precious metals, the [[Apothecaries' system|apothecaries' pound]], (also 5760 grains) was used by [[pharmacist]]s and the [[avoirdupois pound]] (7000 grains) was used for general purposes. The apothecaries and troy pounds are divided into 12 ounces (of 480 grains) while the avoirdupois pound has 16 ounces (of 437.5 grains). The unit of volume, the [[gallon]], has different values in the United States and in the United Kingdom – the US fluid gallon being about 0.83 imperial gallons and the US dry gallon being about 0.97 imperial gallons.

Both systems of measure were widely used in [[mechanical engineering]], though not in [[electrical engineering]]. Some units of measure such as the [[horsepower]] or the [[British thermal unit]] (BTU) have special names but by and large unit names are generated from their constituent components – for example, [[pounds per square inch]]. In contrast, the [[metric system]] has a special name for pressure—the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]].

After the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] the units of measurement in the [[United States]] developed into what is now known as [[United States customary units|customary units]]. The United Kingdom overhauled its system of measurement in 1826, when it introduced the [[imperial units|imperial system of units]]. This resulted in the two countries having different gallons. Later in the century, efforts were made to align the definition of the [[pound (avoirdupois)|pound]] and the [[yard]] in the two countries by using copies of the standards adopted by the British Parliament in 1855. However, these standards were of poor quality compared with those produced for the [[Convention of the Metre]]. In 1960 the two countries agreed to common definitions of the yard and the pound based on definitions of the [[metre]] and the [[kilogram]]. This change, which amounted to a few parts per million, had little effect in the United Kingdom, but resulted in the United States having two slightly different systems of linear measure – the international system, and the surveyors system.

== English units of measure==
{{main|English units}}
[[File:Aethelstan.jpg|thumb|120px|Silver penny of Aethelstan (924-939) from which the name ''[[pennyweight]]'' (dwt) was derived]]

English units of measure, were derived from a combination of [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|Roman]], [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolignian]] and [[Saxons|Saxon]] units of measure.  They were a precursor to both the [[Imperial units|Imperial system of units]] (first defined in 1824, to take effect in 1826) and [[United States customary units]] which evolved from English Units from 1776 onwards.&lt;ref name=Smoot/&gt;

The earliest records of English units of measure involve the weight (and therefore the value) of [[Saxons|Saxon]] coins.  The [[penny]] introduced by [[Offa of Mercia|Offa]] was about 20 grains (1.296&amp;nbsp;g). [[Edward the Elder]] increased the weight of the English penny to 26 grains (1.685&amp;nbsp;g), thereby aligning it with the penny of [[Charlemagne]].  By the time of the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]] (1066), it had decreased to 24 grains (1.555&amp;nbsp;g).  This value was subsequently called the ''[[pennyweight]]'' and formed the basis of the [[Troy weight|Troy units of weight]]—the [[troy ounce]] used to this day for weighting precious metals.&lt;ref name=McGreevy/&gt;{{rp|44–48}} [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] (1272–1307) broke the link between a coin's value and its weight when he debased the English coinage by introducing a [[Groat (coin)|groat]] (four pence) which weighed of 89 grains rather than the expected 96 grains. The groat was further devalued in the 1350s when its weight was reduced to 72 grains.&lt;ref name=Adams&gt;{{cite book

During Saxon times land was measured both in terms of its economic value and in terms of its size. The [[Domesday Book]] used the [[Hide (unit)|hide]], an economic unit of measure. In other references the [[furlong]] and the [[rood]] appear to be units related to ploughing procedures. Of particular interest was the rood which was 15 North German feet in length, the North German foot being equivalent to 335&amp;nbsp;mm (13.2&amp;nbsp;inches).&lt;ref name=McGreevy/&gt;{{rp|50}} Craftsmen, on the other hand used a shorter Roman foot.

In 1324 [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] systematized units of length by defining the inch as 3 barleycorns, the foot as 12 inches, the yard as 3 feet, the perch as 5{{frac|1|2}} yards, and the acre as an area 4 by 40 perches.&lt;ref name=Smoot&gt;{{cite book

The units were however redefined many times – during Henry VIII's time standard yards and ells made of [[brass]] were manufactured, during [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s time these were replaced with standards made of [[bronze]] and in 1742, after scientific comparisons showed a variation of up to 0.2% from the mean, a definitive standard yard was proposed (but not manufactured).&lt;ref name=McGreevy/&gt;{{rp|122–123}}&lt;ref name=knight&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Charles|title=The Penny magazine of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|volume=9|year=1840|pages=221–222|publisher=Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-BHnAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the medieval era agricultural products, apart from wool, were mostly sold by volume, with various [[bushel]]s and [[gallon]]s being introduced over the years for different commodities. In the early fourteenth century the wool trade traditionally used the [[avoirdupois]] system of weights, a process that was formalized by [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] in 1340. At the same time, the [[Stone (unit)|stone]], when used to weigh wool, was formalized as being 14&amp;nbsp;pounds.&lt;ref name=McGreevy&gt;{{cite book

During the [[Tudor period]], numerous reforms were made to English weights and measures. In 1496 [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] ordered that reference copies of the yard, pound and gallon should be made of brass and distributed to specified towns and cities throughout the kingdom.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;{{rp|36}} Many weights and measures that had crept into use were banned: in 1527 [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] banned the [[Tower pound]] (5400 grains against the 5760 grains of the apothecaries and troy pounds) and the [[Pound (mass)#Merchants' pound|mercantile pound]] (6750 grains against the 7000 grains of the pound avoirdupois)&lt;ref name=McGreevy/&gt;{{rp|105}} and in 1592 [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] ordered the use of the "statute mile" (5280 feet against the 5000 feet of the London or Old English mile).&lt;ref name=McGreevy/&gt;{{rp|123}}

Under the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union of 1707]], Scotland, which had developed its own system of weights and measures independently of England, abandoned them in favour of English weights and measures.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;{{rp|90–91}} The [[Acts of Union 1800]] which united Ireland with Great Britain had less of an effect on weights and measures—Irish weights and measures having been based on the English foot and pound avoirdupois since 1351, though the Irish acre and mile were based on a perch of 7 yards, not {{fraction|5|1|2}} yards as in England.&lt;ref name=Kelly/&gt;{{rp|116}}

By the early nineteenth century many commodities had their own set of units, the units of measure for the wool and cloth industries had units of measure specific to those commodities, albeit derived on the pound avoirdupois or the foot while wine and beer used units with the same names but different sizes – the wine gallon being 231 cubic inches and the beer or ale gallon being 282 cubic inches. Agricultural produce was sold by the bushel which was based on yet another gallon – the dry gallon of 268.8 cubic inches. Even though not explicitly permitted by statute, many markets used bushels based on weight rather than volume when selling wheat and barley.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite book

The British [[Weights and Measures Acts of the United Kingdom|Weights and Measures Act]] of 1824 repealed all existing British weights and measures legislation, some dating back to the 1300s, and redefined existing units of measure. In particular, a new standard yard and troy pound were manufactured as the standards for length and weight respectively. A new measure, the [[gallon|imperial gallon]], which replaced the many gallons in use,&lt;ref group = Note&gt;[[Thomas Jefferson]], in his ''[[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States]]'' identified 13 different gallons and 13 different bushels in used in Great Britain in 1790. The gallons ranged from the wine gallon of {{convert|224|cuin|L}} to the beer and ale gallon of {{convert|282|cuin|L}}. The only consistency was 8&amp;nbsp;gallons to the bushel.&lt;/ref&gt; was defined as being the volume of 10&amp;nbsp;pounds of water at 62&amp;nbsp;°F which, after the authorized experiments, was found to be 277.274 cubic inches.

The 1824 Act also introduced some changes to the administration of the standards of weights and measures: previously Parliament had been given the custody of the standards but the act passed this responsibility on to the [[Exchequer]]. The act also set up an inspectorate for weights and measures.&lt;ref name=1824Act/&gt;&lt;ref name=Poppy/&gt;

The standard yard and pound were lost in 1834 when a fire partially destroyed the Palace of Westminster. Following a report published in 1841 by a commission new standard yard and pound were manufactured using the best available secondary sources. Unlike the previous standard, the new pound standard was a pound avoirdupois. They were accepted by an Act of Parliament as the standards for length and weight in 1855. Following the debacle over the different gallons that had been adopted by the United States and the United Kingdom thirty years earlier, one of the copies of the standard yard was offered to and accepted by the United States Government.&lt;ref name=MacLean&gt;{{cite conference

The 1835 Weights and Measures Act tidied up a number of shortcomings in the 1825 Act. In response to representations from traders, the [[stone (unit)|stone]] and the [[hundredweight]] were formally defined as being 14&amp;nbsp;pounds and 112&amp;nbsp;pounds respectively and the experiment of defining a "heaped" measure as outlined in the 1824 Act was abandoned.&lt;ref name=Poppy/&gt; Not all trades followed the use of the 14&amp;nbsp;stone&amp;mdash;Britten, in 1880 for example, catalogued a number of different values of the stone in various British towns and cities ranging from 4&amp;nbsp;lb to 26&amp;nbsp;lb&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Weights and Measures Act of 1878 overhauled the inspection regime of weights and measures used in trade. The act also reaffirmed the use of the brass standard yard and platinum standard pound as the standards for use in the United Kingdom, reaffirmed the use of apothecaries measures in the pharmaceutical industry, reaffirmed the 1824 definition of the gallon, removed the Troy pound from the list of legal units of measure, added the fathom to the list of legal units and fixed the ratio of metric to imperial units at one metre being equal to 39.3708 inches and one kilogram being equal to 15432.3487 grains (1&amp;nbsp;lb = 0.453592654&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=Poppy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Weights and Measures Act of 1878 effectively prohibited the use of metric weights for trade, the United Kingdom having declined to sign the [[Metre Convention|Convention of the Metre]] three years previously.

Under the Weights and Measures Act of 1824 custody of the standard yard and pound and custody of the administration of weights and measures was entrusted to the [[Exchequer]] but verification was administered locally. The 1835 Act formally described the office and duties of Inspectors of Weights and Measures and required every borough to appoint such officers and the 1866 Act passed responsibility for weights and measures to the [[Board of Trade]]. In 1900 the Board of Trade established the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL) to provide laboratory facilities for weights and measures.&lt;ref name=Poppy/&gt;

After the passage of the 1897 Act, weights and measures in the United Kingdom remained relatively unchanged until after the [[Second World War]]. By the middle of the century the difference of 2 parts per million between the British and US standard yards was causing problems—in 1900 a tolerance of 10 parts per million was adequate for science, but by 1950 this tolerance had shrunk to 0.25 parts per million.&lt;ref name=McGreevy/&gt;{{rp|155}} In 1960 representatives from the NPL and other national laboratories from the United States and Commonwealth agreed to redefine the yard as being exactly 0.9144&amp;nbsp;metres, an action that was ratified by the British Government as part of the 1963 Weights and Measures Act.

[[Metrication in the United Kingdom]] began in the mid-1960s. Initially this metrication was voluntary and by 1985 many traditional and imperial units of measure had been voluntarily removed from use in the retail trade. The Weights and Measures Act of 1985 formalized their removal for use in trade, though imperial units were retained for use on road signs and the most common imperial weights such as the foot, inch, pound, ounce, gallon and pint continued to be used in the retail trade for the sale of loose goods or goods measured or weighed in front of the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK

In 1821 [[John Quincy Adams]], then [[Secretary of State]] submitted a report based on research commissioned by the Senate in 1817 which recommended against adoption of the metric  system. Congress did nothing and in 1832 the Treasury adopted the yard of 36 inches as the unit of length for customs purposes, the avoirdupois pound of 7000 grains as the unit of weight and the gallon of 231 cubic inches (the "Queen Anne gallon") and the bushel of 2150.42 cubic inches as the units of volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Bushel Table of States.jpg|thumb|250px|Nineteenth century list of various bushels by state and commodity]]
Throughout the nineteenth century individual states developed their own standards and in particular a variety of bushels based on weight (mass) rather than volume emerged, dependent on both commodity and state.  This lack of uniformity crippled inter-state trade and in 1905 the National Bureau of Standards called a meeting of the states to discuss the lack of uniform standards and in many cases, a means of regulatory oversight. A meeting was held the following year and subsequently became an annual gathering known as the [[National Conference on Weights and Measures]] (NCWM).  In 1915 the conference published its first model standards.&lt;ref name="OurHistory"/&gt;  The bushel was not fully standardized and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] still (May 2013) uses different bushels for different commodities—a bushel of [[Maize|corn]] being 56&amp;nbsp;lb, a bushel of [[oat]]s 38&amp;nbsp;lb and a bushel of [[soybean]]s 60&amp;nbsp;lb and a bushel of [[Winter wheat|red winter wheat]] (both hard and soft) also 60&amp;nbsp;lb.  Other commodities at the exchange are reckoned in pounds, in short tons or in metric tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

During the twentieth century the principal change in the customary system of weights and measures was an agreement between NIST and the corresponding bodies in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the United Kingdom, signed in 1960, that redefined the yard and the pound in terms of the metre and the kilogram respectively.  These new units became known as the international yard and pound. Congress has neither endorsed nor repudiated this action. (See {{section link||Metric equivalents}}).

Imperial and US customary units have long been used in many branches of engineering. 
Two of the earliest such units of measure to come into use were the ''[[horsepower]]'' and the [[Fahrenheit|''degree Fahrenheit'']]. The ''horsepower'' was defined by [[James Watt]] in 1782 as the power required to raise 33,000 pounds of water through a height of one foot in one minute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1777 the [[Royal Society]], under the chairmanship of [[Henry Cavendish]], proposed the definition of the Fahrenheit scale be modified such that the temperature corresponding to the melting point of ice be 32&amp;nbsp;°F and the boiling point of water under standard atmospheric conditions be 212&amp;nbsp;°F.

The [[British thermal unit]] (Btu) is defined as the heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|British thermal unit}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in use before 1859 as a unit of heat based on imperial units rather than the metric units used by the French&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1873 a committee of the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] under the chairmanship of [[Lord Kelvin|William Thomson (Lord Kelvin)]] introduced the concept of a [[Coherence (units of measurement)|coherence]] into units of measure and proposed the names [[dyne]] and [[erg]] as the units of [[force]] and [[Work (physics)|work]] in the [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS system of units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

*The [[dyne]] is the force needed to accelerate a mass of 1&amp;nbsp;g by 1&amp;nbsp;cm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
*The [[erg]] is the work done when a mass of 1&amp;nbsp;g is moved a distance of 1&amp;nbsp;cm when opposed by a force of 1&amp;nbsp;dyne
Since all the constants in these relationships is unity, the units are said to be [[coherence (units of measurement)|coherent]].&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later [[James Thomson (engineer)|James Thomson]], older brother of William Thomson introduced the term [[poundal]] as a coherent unit of force in the [[Foot–pound–second system]] (FPS) of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|poundal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent FPS unit of work was the [[foot-poundal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Other systems for the measurement of dynamic quantities that used imperial and US customary units are the [[British Gravitational System]] (BG) proposed by [[Arthur Mason Worthington]] and the [[English Engineering Units|English Engineering System]] (EE). Both systems depend on the [[gravitational acceleration]], and use the [[pound-force]] as the unit of force but use different approaches when applying [[Newton's laws of motion]]. In the BG system, force, rather than mass is a [[SI base unit|base unit]] while the [[Slug (unit)|slug]] is a derived unit of [[inertia]] (rather than mass).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Both these approaches led to slight variations in the meaning of the pound-force (and also of the kilogram force) in different parts of the world.  Various countries published standard values that should be used for ''g'' and in 1901 the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures|CGPM]] published a standard value for ''g'' that should be used in the "International Service of Weights and Measures", namely 9.80665&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (32.174&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) which is equal to the value of ''g'' at 45° latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Newton's second law]] in these systems becomes:
:'''BG:''' Force (lbf) = inertia (slugs) × acceleration (ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
:'''EE:''' Force (lbf) = mass (lb) × ''g'' × acceleration (ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

[[File:StandardYardEnd.jpg|thumb|End of the Standard yard of 1855 showing the gold plugs which bore the markings for the standard yard]]
The standard yard and [Troy] pound were lost in 1834 when a [[Burning of Parliament|fire partially destroyed the Palace of Westminster]]. Following a report published in 1841 by a commission new standard yard and pound were manufactured using the best available secondary sources. Unlike the previous standard, the new pound standard, made of platinum, was a pound avoirdupois. The new yard, slightly longer than a yard to prevent wear as was experienced with the ''[[mètre des Archives]]'', was made of brass and had two gold plugs close to its end. Scratch marks on the plugs denoted the length of the yard. They were accepted by an Act of Parliament as the standards for length and weight in 1855. Following the debacle over the different gallons that had been adopted by the United States and the United Kingdom thirty years earlier, one of the copies of the standard yard and avoirdupois pound (known in the United States as the "Mint pound") was offered to and accepted by the United States Government.&lt;ref name=MacLean/&gt;

In the years that followed the passing of the 1878 Act, the standard imperial yard was found to be shrinking at a rate, confirmed in 1950, to be nearly one part per million every 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

:1 international pound = {{gaps|0.453|592 37|kilograms}}
The final digit of the value chosen for the pound was chosen so as to make the number exactly divisible by 7, making the grain exactly {{gaps|64.798|91|milligrams}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The definition of units of weight above a pound differed between the customary and the imperial system - the imperial system employed the stone of 14&amp;nbsp;pounds, the hundredweight of 8&amp;nbsp;stone&lt;ref group=Note&gt;In this context, the plural is "stone", not "stones"&lt;/ref&gt; and the ton of 2240&amp;nbsp;pounds (20 hundredweight), while the customary system of units did not employ the stone but has a hundredweight of 100&amp;nbsp;pounds and a ton of 2000&amp;nbsp;pounds. In international trade, the ton of 2240&amp;nbsp;pounds was often referred to as the "long ton" and the ton of 2000&amp;nbsp;pounds as the "short ton".  When using customary units, it is usual to express [[body weight]] in pounds, but when using imperial units,  to use [[Stone (unit)|stones and pounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In his ''[[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States]]'', [[Thomas Jefferson]], then [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]], identified 14 different gallons in English statutes varying in size from 224 to 282 cubic inches (3.67 to 4.62 litres).&lt;ref name=Jefferson/&gt; In 1832, in the absence of any direction by [[United States Congress|Congress]], the [[United States Department of the Treasury|United States Treasury]] chose the second smallest gallon, the "Queen Anne gallon" of 231 cubic inches (3.785 litres) to be the official gallon in the United States for fiscal purposes. Sixteen US fluid ounces make a US pint (8 pints equals 1 gallon in both customary and imperial systems). During the reform of Weights and measures legislation in the United Kingdom in 1824, old gallons were replaced by the new imperial gallon which was defined to be the volume to 10 pounds of water at 62&amp;nbsp;°F (17&amp;nbsp;°C) and determined experimentally to be 277.42 cubic inches (4.546 litres).  Twenty imperial fluid ounces make an imperial pint, the imperial fluid ounce being 0.96 US fluid ounces.

The US Customary system of units makes use of set of dry units of capacity that have a similar set of names&lt;ref group = Note&gt;NIST does not catalogue a "dry gallon" in its list of US units of measure.&lt;/ref&gt; to those of liquid capacity, though different volumes - the dry pint having a volume of 33.6 cubic inches (550&amp;nbsp;ml) against the US fluid pint's volume of 28.875 cubic inches (473&amp;nbsp;ml) and the imperial pint of 34.68 cubic inches (568&amp;nbsp;ml).  The imperial system of measure does not have an equivalent to the US customary system of "dry measure".

In the international commodities markets, the [[Barrel (unit)|barrel]] ({{gaps|42|US|gallons}}, ~159&amp;nbsp;litres) is used in both London and New York/Chicago for trading in crude oil and the [[troy ounce]] (~31.10&amp;nbsp;grams) for trading in precious metals, otherwise the London markets use metric units and the [[Chicago Board of Trade]] uses customary units.

Prior to metrication, the units of measure used in the [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]  were the same as those used in the United Kingdom while those used in the [[British Commonwealth]] and in [[South Africa]] were in most cases a subset of those used in the United Kingdom with, in certain cases, local differences.

Unless otherwise specified, the units of measure quoted below were used in both the United States, the United Kingdom. The SI equivalents are quoted to four significant figures.

In 1893 the United States fixed the yard at {{fract|3600|3937}} metres, making the yard 0.9144018 metres and 1896 the British authorities fixed the yard as being 0.9143993 metres. At the time the discrepancy of about two parts per million was considered to be insignificant. In 1960, the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada and South Africa standardised their units of length by defining the [[international yard and pound|"international yard"]] as being 0.9144 metres exactly. This change affected land surveyors in the United States and led to the old units being renamed "survey feet", "survey miles" etc.  However the introduction of the metric-based Ordnance Survey National Grid Surveyors in the United Kingdom in 1938 meant that British surveyors were unaffected by the change.

Several of the units of liquid volume or capacity have similar names, but have different volumes – and in the case of fluid ounces and pints, different relations. In addition the definitions of the imperial and US gallons are based on different concepts – the imperial gallon is defined in terms of the volume occupied by a specified mass of water, while the US gallon is specified in terms of cubic linear measure.

Units of weight in both the imperial and US customary system always used the same standard, though differences in multiples of the avoirdupois pound developed in the nineteenth century. Both systems used the three different scales – the avoirdupois system for general use, the troy system for precious metals and the apothecaries system in the pharmacy industry. The term "weight" and "mass" are used interchangeably in the imperial and US customary systems, though since the linking of the pound to the kilogram in 19xx, the pound technically became a mass, not a weight.

Apothecaries weights were used in the [[Pharmacy|pharmaceutical]] industry and have remained almost unchanged since the Middle Ages – the Apothecaries pound and ounce being the same as the Troy pound and ounce, but each system having different sub-units. In the United Kingdom, these units are of historic interest only, having been replaced by metric units in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Named units of energy, power and temperature===
The names of most derived units of measure in the imperial and US customary systems are concatenations of the constituent parts of the unit of measure, for example the unit of pressure is the ''[[Pounds per square inch|pounds [force] per square inch]]''. Apart from the [[poundal]], most of the named units of measure are [[Coherence (units of measurement)|non-coherent]], but were adopted due to traditional working practice.&lt;ref group = Note&gt;For example, the [[horsepower]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other units===
In addition to those catalogued above, there are literally hundreds of other units of measure in both the imperial and the US customary system of measurement – many are specific to a particular industry of application. Such units could, in theory, be replaced by general units of the same dimension, for example the [[Barrel (unit)|barrel]] (42 US gallons, 34.97 imperial gallons or 159.0 litres) used in the oil industry has the dimension of volume and could be replaced by the gallon, cubic metre or litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The definitions of [[potential difference]] ([[volt]]), [[electric current]] ([[ampere]]), [[electrical resistance]] ([[ohm]]) were defined in terms of metric units, international agreement having been reached at a series of IEC Congress in Chicago between 1881 and 1906 when the electrical industry was in its infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Similarly, the units of measurement used in the [[Radiation|radiological]] industry were defined in terms of metric units, agreement first having been reached at the second International Congress of Radiology at Stockholm (1928).&lt;ref name=ISR_History&gt;{{cite web

==Current status==

Since its inception, the [[metric system]] has displaced the traditional system of units in many countries. In the 1960s a [[metrication]] program was initiated in most English-speaking countries, resulting in either the partial or total displacement of the imperial system or the US customary system of measure in those countries. The current status of imperial and US customary units, as summarised by [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]], is that "the SI metric system is now the official system of units in the United Kingdom, while the customary units are still predominantly used in the United States".&lt;ref name=NISTB&gt;{{cite journal
|url = https://www.nist.gov/pml/wmd/pubs/upload/AppB-12-hb44-final.pdf

|publisher = [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST)
|title = NIST Handbook 44 – Specifications, Tolerances, and Other Technical Requirements for Weighing and Measuring Devices
|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation is however not as clear-cut as this. In the United States, for example, the metric system is the predominant system of measure in certain fields such as automobile manufacture even though customary units are used in aircraft manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

{{As of|2013|6}} the imperial and US customary systems of measurement were dependent on the [[International system of units|SI]] for their formal definitions, the yard being defined as 0.9144&amp;nbsp;[[metre]]s exactly, the pound avoirdupois as {{val|0.45359237}} [[kilogram]]s exactly while both systems of measure share the definition of the [[second]].

As a result of its high level of immigration and emigration and its status as common source and destination for a large amount of international travel the United States has more incoming and outgoing [[international child abduction]]s per year than any other country.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  To address this issue the United States played an active role in the drafting of the 1980 [[Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction]] (commonly referred to as the ''Hague Abduction Convention'' or simply the ''Abduction Convention''.)  Although the United States was one of the first nations to sign the Convention in 1981 the Convention did not enter into force for the US until 1988 with the enactment by Congress of the [[International Child Abduction Remedies Act]] which translated the Convention into US law.&lt;ref name="Hcch.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&amp;cid=24 |title=Status Table of the Permanent Bureau of the Hague Conference |publisher=Hcch.net |date=1980-10-25 |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] the United States is required to fulfill many requirements designed to protect children from the harmful effects of international child abduction.  Domestic and foreign parents and attorneys have criticized the United States for its alleged failures to adequately fulfill these obligations on behalf of foreign and domestic families and children and in violation of international law.

==United States Legal System and International Abduction==
{{further|Law of the United States}}
[[File:Constitution of the United States, page 1.jpg|thumb|The [[United States Constitution]], the supreme law of the United States]]

The '''law of the United States''' consists of many levels&lt;ref&gt;See Stephen Elias and Susan Levinkind, ''Legal Research: How to Find &amp; Understand The Law'', 14th ed. (Berkeley: Nolo, 2005), 22.&lt;/ref&gt; of codified and uncodified forms of [[law]], of which the most important is the [[United States Constitution]], the foundation of the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] of the [[United States]].  The Constitution sets out the boundaries of [[federal law]], which consists of constitutional [[acts of Congress]], constitutional [[treaty|treaties]] ratified by [[United States Congress|Congress]], constitutional regulations promulgated by the [[executive branch]], and [[case law]] originating from the [[United States federal courts|federal judiciary]].

The Constitution and federal law are the [[Supremacy Clause|supreme law of the land]], thus preempting conflicting state and territorial laws in the fifty [[U.S. state]]s and in the territories.&lt;ref&gt;William Burnham, ''Introduction to the Law and Legal System of the United States'', 4th ed. (St. Paul, MN: Thomson West, 2006), 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the scope of federal preemption is limited, because the scope of federal power is itself rather limited.  In the unique dual-sovereign system of [[Federalism in the United States|American federalism]]. Most U.S. law (especially the actual "living law" of [[contract]], [[tort]], [[criminal law|criminal]], and [[family law]] experienced by the majority of citizens on a day-to-day basis) consists primarily of state law, which can and does vary greatly from one state to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence M. Friedman, ''A History of American Law'', 3rd ed. (New York: Touchstone, 2005), 307 and 504-505.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Hughes, "Common Law Systems," in ''Fundamentals of American Law'', ed. Alan B. Morisson, 9-26 (New York: [[Oxford University Press]], 1996), 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

At both the federal and state levels, the law of the United States was originally derived largely from the [[common law]] system of [[English law]], which was in force at the time of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, U.S. law has since diverged greatly from its English ancestor both in terms of substance and procedure, and has incorporated a number of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] innovations.

States are separate [[sovereignty|sovereigns]] with their own [[State constitution (United States)|state constitutions]], [[state government]]s, and [[State court (United States)|state courts]] (including [[state supreme court]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|U.S. Const., Amend. X]].&lt;/ref&gt; They retain [[plenary power]] to make laws covering anything not preempted by the federal Constitution, federal statutes, or international treaties ratified by the federal Senate.  Normally, state supreme courts are the final interpreters of state constitutions and state law, unless their interpretation itself presents a federal issue, in which case a decision may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court by way of a petition for writ of [[certiorari]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{UnitedStatesCode|28|1257}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922, the Court applied the [[Supremacy Clause]] to international treaties, holding in the case of ''[[Missouri v. Holland]]'', [[Case citation|252 U.S. 416]] (1920), that the Federal government's ability to make [[treaty|treaties]] is supreme over any State concerns that such treaties might abrogate [[states' rights]] arising under the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]].

==Hague Abduction Convention==
{{Main article|Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction}}
{{further|International Child Abduction Remedies Act}}
[[File:Members and Non Members of the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction Hague Convention.svg|thumb|alt=Hague Abduction Signatories|Hague Abduction Signatories {{legend|#4973C5|State parties to the convention (members of the [[Hague Conference on Private International Law|HCCH]])}}
                       {{legend|#14D9E1|State parties to the convention (non-members of the HCCH)}}|350px]]

The [[Hague Abduction Convention]] is a [[multilateralism|multilateral]] [[treaty]] (in force since 1 December 1983) aimed at providing an expeditious method to return children who are victim of international child abduction. The Convention was drafted to “to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting State" diverse from their country of [[habitual residence]], and "ensure that rights of [[child custody|custody]] and of access under the law of one Contracting State are effectively respected in the other Contracting States.”

Although the United States was one of the first nations to sign the Convention in 1981 the Convention did not enter into force for the United States until 1988 with the ratification of the treaty and enactment by Congress of the [[International Child Abduction Remedies Act]] which translated the Convention into US law.&lt;ref name="Hcch.net"/&gt; This was 5 years after the entry into force of the treaty.

===Courts empowered to hear Hague Abduction Convention cases===
The United States has two separate court systems, a Federal court system and a State court system. Both types of courts have authority to hear a Hague Abduction Convention case, as established by the International Child Abduction Remedies Act. It is up to the parents of abducted children and their attorneys to decide whether to file a petition for return in State or Federal court.

Although the exact implementation varies by state (also because states are free to adopt their own organizational scheme for judicial matters), trial courts are the general [[court of first instance]] to hear a Convention case within the State court system.

===United States legal precedents in Hague Convention cases===

Since the enactment of the [[International Child Abduction Remedies Act|ICARA]] and simultaneous ratification of the treaty by the [[United States Congress]] allowed it to enter into force in 1988, a number of important, and precedent setting decisions have been made on the Hague Convention's interpretation within the United States by federal courts.

====Abbott v. Abbott====
{{Main article|Abbott v. Abbott}}
The first [[Hague Abduction Convention]] case to be considered by the [[United States Supreme Court]] revolved around a whether or not a child from [[Chile]] was "wrongfully removed," as understood by the Convention, when a ''ne exeat'' order existing forbidding the custodial parent from removing the child from the country.  The Court found broad acceptance for the view that a ''ne exeat'' right, or a right to prevent a child's removal from his country of residence, is roughly equal to "[[joint custody]]" and is, thus, a "right of custody."   Accordingly, when the child was removed from Chile in violation of Mr. Abbott's ''ne exeat'' right, the child was "wrongfully removed" within the meaning of the Hague Convention.&lt;ref name="Abbott"&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Abbott v. Abbott|docket=08-645|date=2010|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.plnavby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;page=08-64508-645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Abduction Statistics==

[[File:Report on the Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (2010 edition - front cover).jpg|thumb|150px|alt=2010 Report Covert|2010 Report Cover]]

The US State department publishes yearly reports are known as the [[Hague Abduction Convention Compliance Reports]] (or: Compliance Reports) in which statistics are presented on child abduction. The publication is a requirement by the US Congress and treats both compliance with the convention by member states and information on child abduction cases in non-member states. The reports highlight countries that they are non-compliant with the convention or exhibit a "pattern of noncompliance."  Since 1999, Mexico has been cited every year as being non-compliant or exhibiting "patterns of noncompliance". The reports form the basis for statistics on the United States and international child abduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/pdf/2010ComplianceReport.pdf |title=2010 Compliance Report |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528014323/http://travel.state.gov/pdf/2010ComplianceReport.pdf# |archive-date=2010-05-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
Only Hong Kong, Macau, Israel, Thailand and Sri Lanka, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are contracting states to the Child Abduction Convention. Of these, Israel has been named several years as having "enforcement problems" in the complicance reports.

====Japan====
{{Main article|International child abduction in Japan}}

[[Japan]] is -with India- one of only two non-contracting states to the convention to rank as one of the top ten destination countries for the abduction of American children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/pdf/2009HagueAbductionConventionComplianceReport.pdf |title=Report on Compliance with the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction |author=Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs |date=April 2009 |work= |publisher=United States Department of State |accessdate=25 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018220035/http://travel.state.gov/pdf/2009HagueAbductionConventionComplianceReport.pdf# |archive-date=2009-10-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there is a  year by year increase in abduction cases. In 2009, 73 outstanding cases involving 104 children who have been abducted to or retained in Japan by parents were reported.&lt;ref name="dad released"/&gt;  An additional 29 cases involve American parties in Japan with one parent denied access to their child.&lt;ref name="dad released"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Dad Released From Japanese Jail in Custody Fight |author= |newspaper=ABC |date= |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/father-released-japanese-jail/Story?id=8833610&amp;page=2 |accessdate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 report 79 child abduction cases were mentioned involving 100 children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Child custody division set up |author=MINORU MATSUTANI |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=3 December 2009 |url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20091203a2.html |accessdate=3 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A State Department official stated in 2008 that no child has ever been returned to the United States from Japan as a result of diplomatic or legal means&lt;ref name="ABC1"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Spirited Away: Japan Won't Let Abducted Kids Go|newspaper=ABC News|url=http://i.abcnews.com/TheLaw/Story?id=4342760&amp;page=2}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The official stated he knew of only three cases where children have returned to America, two involving reconciliation of parents, and one in which a 15-year-old child escaped to the American embassy.&lt;ref name="ABC1"/&gt;

====India====
&lt;!--the US-specifics of this section is unclear. Should it be here at all?--&gt;
[[India]] is not a signatory of the Hague Abduction Convention and India does not consider international child abduction a crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/12/06/japan-india-pressed-curb-child-abductions/|title=Japan, India pressed to curb child abductions|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian courts rarely recognize U.S. custody orders, preferring to exert their own jurisdiction in rulings that tend to favor the parent who wants to keep the child in India. In the rare scenario that a case is resolved, it is usually due to an agreement between the parents, rather than the result of court orders or arrest warrants.

Cultural factors often impact child custody decisions in India. For example, Indian courts rarely grant custody to a parent residing outside of India, even if both the child and abducting parent are American citizens. Additionally, the courts tend to favor mothers when determining custody.

India does require the signature of both parents for an Indian passport to be issued to children younger than 18 years. India also requires exit permits for children.&lt;ref&gt;https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_4441.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saudi Arabia====
[[Saudi Arabia]] is not a signatory of the Hague Abduction Convention nor are there any international or bilateral treaties in force between Saudi Arabia and the United States dealing with international parental child abduction.

In Saudi Arabia, child custody is based on [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. The primary concern of Saudi courts in deciding child custody cases is that the child be raised in accordance with the [[Islam|Islamic faith]]. Most custody disputes in Saudi Arabia are handled by the Islamic [[Sharia]] courts. In rare cases, the Board of Grievances, the most senior non-Sharia court, has ruled on custody disputes.

Saudi courts generally do not award custody of children to non-Saudi women. If the mother is an Arab Muslim, judges will usually not grant her custody of children unless she is residing in Saudi Arabia, or the father is not a Muslim. All Saudi citizens are considered to be Muslim.

Since Saudi women are prohibited from marrying non-Muslims, custody disputes between a Saudi mother and American father would be heard by the Sharia court, which would usually apply Islamic rules of custody. If the mother wins custody, the father is usually granted visitation rights. According to Saudi law, a child whose mother is Saudi and father is non-Saudi is not granted Saudi citizenship. However, even if an American father wins custody of his children, he may still need permission from the Saudi mother to remove the children from Saudi Arabia.

Normally, under Sharia law, a mother can maintain custody of her male children until the age of nine, and female children until age seven. In practice the courts favor keeping children within a strict Islamic environment. Sharia court judges have broad discretion in custody cases and often make exceptions to these general guidelines.

Even when a mother who is residing in Saudi Arabia is granted physical custody of children, the father maintains legal custody and has the right to determine where the children live and travel. In many cases, the father has been able to assume legal custody of children against the wishes of the mother when she is unable or unwilling to meet certain conditions set by law for her to maintain her custodial rights. For example, if the mother moves to another country, the father is entitled to have custody. A court can sever a mother's custody if it determines that the mother is incapable of safeguarding the child or of bringing the child up in accordance with the appropriate religious standards. The mother can lose custody by remarrying a non-Muslim, or by residing in a home with non-relatives. Sharia law allows custody of children to be awarded to the closest male relative of a Saudi father in the case of death or imprisonment of the father, even if the Saudi father has made clear his wish that the children's mother have full custody.

Custody orders and judgments of foreign courts are generally not enforceable in Saudi Arabia.  Courts in Saudi Arabia will not enforce U.S. court decrees ordering a parent in Saudi Arabia to pay [[child support]].

Women entering Saudi Arabia with the intent of visiting their children may do so only with the written permission of the father of the children. The father must file a "statement of no objection" with the Saudi Ministry of Interior before the mother will be granted a [[visa (document)|visa]] to enter the Kingdom. This includes Muslim fathers who are non-Saudi nationals. If the father refuses to sponsor the mother, or to authorize a child’s travel to another country, there is little that can be done to effect a visit. The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General are not able to help American parents to obtain visas to Saudi Arabia without a no-objection letter. Neither the U.S. State Department nor the U.S. Mission in Saudi Arabia may serve as a woman's sponsor. Women visitors are required to be met by their sponsor upon arrival in Saudi Arabia.

If a non-Saudi father wants to enter the Kingdom to visit his children, he can do so by applying for a Saudi visa with proof that his children are living in Saudi Arabia. Saudi authorities may consult with the mother if she is Saudi, who may be able to prevent issuance of the visa.

Some American Muslim parents have considered traveling to Saudi Arabia on [[Umrah]] (religious pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]) as a means to visit their children. However, issuance of an Umrah visa does not guarantee that a parent will be permitted to see his or her children once in the Kingdom. If a woman is not divorced, the Saudi Embassy has the right to ask for her husband's permission for another family member (e.g. son) to act as the mother's Mahram. If the mother is divorced, the Saudi Embassy will ask to see the divorce certificate before granting the Umrah visa. Women married to Saudis should keep in mind that even when they enter the Kingdom on an Umrah visa, they would need their Saudi husband's permission to depart the country.

Persons who obtain a visa for business or religious visits (Hajj and Umrah) with the intention of visiting their children may face legal penalties including detention and/or deportation. While visitor visas are issued for approved tour groups following organized itineraries, these visitors are not permitted to travel outside the set itinerary.

Before traveling to Saudi Arabia to visit their children, women should consider whether they obtained a complete Islamic declaration of divorce from the Sharia court in Saudi Arabia. Secular, American divorce orders are not recognized by the Sharia courts. Although an Islamic divorce can be obtained from several mosques within the U.S., it has been the experience of several divorced spouses in the U.S. that the Sharia courts in Saudi Arabia will not recognize orders originating from an American mosque. The purpose of obtaining a Sharia declaration is to establish the legal personal status of the mother prior to traveling to the Kingdom. If an American woman is considered to still be married, the "husband" can prohibit the woman from departing Saudi Arabia.

Exit visas are required to leave Saudi Arabia. The U.S. Embassy or Consulates General cannot obtain exit visas for American citizens. Women must have permission from their husband or father to exit Saudi Arabia. The government of Saudi Arabia has been known to issue international arrest warrants against women who have taken their children from Saudi Arabia without the father's permission.&lt;ref name="SaudiArabiaFlyer"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_517.html |title=International Parental Child Abduction Saudi Arabia |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Most countries in Europe have are contracting parties to the Hague Abduction Convention, including all countries of the [[European Union]]. Most of these countries have never been mentioned in the compliance reports. Germany, Greece, Poland and Switzerland are notable exceptions.

====Germany====
The Hague Abduction Convention entered into force between Germany and the United States on December 1, 1990. According to the [compliance reports, 71 children abducted from the United States to Germany in 2009 and 20 children abducted from Germany to the United States during the same period.  Between 1999 and 2010 the reports have cited Germany as a "country of concern," having "enforcement problems," being "not fully compliant" or "demonstrated patterns of noncompliance" almost every year.

The Hague Convention came into force between the United States and Greece on June 1, 1993. Greece has been cited in the compliance Reports almost every year as either a "Country of Concern," having "Enforcement Problems," or "Demonstrating Patterns of Noncompliance."

Institutionally, the legal framework in Greece seems to support the necessary mechanisms for the Convention to function effectively. The Convention has force of law and has primacy over domestic law; first instance courts can hear Convention cases under expedited procedures (provisional or “emergency” measures), enforcement mechanisms exist and the Greek Central Authority will provide pro-bono legal assistance to victimized parents during Hague proceedings before the appropriate court in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_492.html |title=International Parental Child Abduction Greece |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hague Abduction Convention came into force between the United States and [[Poland]] on November 11, 1992. Poland has been cited in the compliance Reports for every year from 2000 to 2008 as either a "country of concern," having "enforcement problems" or "demonstrating patterns of noncompliance" with the Hague Abduction Convention resulting in an ongoing dialogue between the Polish Consul General and the [[Office of Children's Issues]] Director in Washington, D.C. and U.S. Embassy officials and Ministry of Justice officials in Warsaw.  Several high-level meetings between U.S. Embassy Warsaw and the Polish Ministry of Justice have been held where Ministry representatives indicated an intent to address many of these compliance issues and improve Poland’s Convention performance.  Officials from the [[U.S. Department of State]] and the U.S. Embassy in Poland have raised compliance issues and individual abduction cases with high-ranking officials from the Polish Government through diplomatic notes, formal demarches, and communications with the Polish Central Authority with former assistant Secretary for Consular Affairs [[Maura Harty]] raising the issue during bilateral meetings with her Polish counterpart.

Among the issues cited in the Compliance Reports, there is no specific legislation that implements the Convention in Poland. Unless there is a voluntary return, children normally remain in Poland during the entire Hague process, which often takes years. There is a perception that there is a gender bias in favor of mothers when they are abducting parents. Even though enforcement legislation has been passed, there appears to be reluctance on the part of officials to follow through with enforcement.  A faulty translation into Polish of Article 13 of the Convention which radically lowers the standard for refusing returns by saying that return can be denied if it would put the child in an "unfavorable" rather than an "intolerable" situation that some courts still use four years after the Ministry of Justice agreed in 1999 to distribute an accurate translation. Furthermore, Polish law does not permit courts to consider resources for child welfare and protection in the country of habitual residence when asked to consider the grave risk defense.

Polish authorities are often unable to locate the children and their abductors after courts ordered the return of a child. Law enforcement in Poland is limited by the fact that neither parental abduction nor the failure to comply with a Convention return order is a criminal offense in Poland. Consequently, Polish authorities have fewer investigative resources available to locate children and their abducting parents.  The lack of an adequate domestic statutory framework with enforcement mechanisms (e.g., a parent who becomes a fugitive to avoid complying with a final return judgment does not commit a "crime"—and therefore cannot be the subject of a fugitive warrant—unless the parent has been stripped of parental rights.)

Refusing to obey an order seems to carry few negative consequences for the taking parent. In some instances, the court rewarded the taking parent who refused to comply with a court order by ultimately ruling that, because so much time had elapsed, it was not in the child's best interests to be returned after all.

Even in cases where the left-behind parent has provided specific information about where the child is located, the ability of the Polish authorities to verify it is ineffective.  Further, once a child is located, there does not appear to be any mechanism to ensure that abducting parents cannot further abscond or conceal the child's whereabouts.  This is largely due to the fact that international parental child abduction is merely a civil offense in Poland.

Courts routinely order psychological evaluations and home studies. In one U.S. case an abducting parent in hiding was able to protest a return order in court while also collecting child support payments from the government.  This situation indicates that institutionally there is a disturbing lack of coordination among local law enforcement, the Polish Central Authority, and social welfare agencies.

The Polish procedure does limit the number of courts that can hear Hague cases in an attempt to allow judges to develop Hague expertise and the Polish Central Authority will provide pro bono legal assistance for victim parents during Hague proceedings before the appropriate court in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_515.html |title=International Parental Child Abduction Poland |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Switzerland====
[[Switzerland]] has been frequently cited in the compliance reports as either a "Country of Concern," having "Enforcement Problems," or "Demonstrating Patterns of Noncompliance." In the 2010 report it was noted that: "delays in processing and enforcement often go on for weeks or months years{{clarify|date=January 2011}}, Swiss courts often treat Convention cases as custody decisions, invoking the child's “best interests” as a reason for denying return, and performing merits-based custody assessments, Swiss courts - up to and including Switzerland's highest court, often show bias toward the abducting parent, especially when the taking parent is the mother". High-level Swiss officials have defended this practice citing the “special relationship” between mothers and young children as influencing its decision to uphold the lower court's denial of the left-behind parent's application for return of an abducted child to the United States.  The report also observed that Swiss authorities are reluctant to actively enforce orders granting return to the United States or access to the child by the left-behind parent. Law enforcement has made only cursory efforts to locate taking parent and abducted children.{{clarify|is this according to the report?|date=January 2011}}

===Latin America===
[[File:Latin America (orthographic projection).svg|125px|left]]

According to the statistics in the [[US Department of State]]'s [[Hague Abduction Convention Compliance Reports|Compliance Reports]], as of 2010, 721 out of 1194, or 60%, of the children abducted from the United States to a Hague Convention partner were taken to [[Latin America]] with [[Mexico]] alone accounting for 474 or 40%.

The Child Abduction Convention entered into force between [[Brazil]] with the United States in 2003.  The US Department of State denoted Brazil as a country demonstrating "patterns of noncompliance" with the Hague Abduction Convention in 2008 and 2009.  In 2010 the status of Brazil's compliance was downgraded to that of "non-compliant." According to a 2009 [[New York Times]] report, there were at the time around fifty unsolved Convention cases for children abducted from the United States to Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Semple, K (2009), ''Court Battle Over a Child Strains Ties in 2 Nations'', New York Times, 24 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The report states that Brazil has a history of non-compliance, and the Brazilian judiciary has a general inability to adjudicate a final and unappealable decision in Convention cases.

The subject of child abduction between the United States and Brazil received sustained media attention during 2009 and early 2010 as a result of the [[Goldman child abduction case]].  US Congress introduced H.R. 2702{{clarify|date=January 2011}}, legislation to suspend Brazil's [[Generalized System of Preferences]] trading benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-2702&amp;tab=summary|title=Suspend Brazil GSP Act (2009; 111th Congress H.R. 2702) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was also discussed on the US House of Representatives floor with a statement from Congressman [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] (Republican, New Jersey), a staunch supporter of David Goldman, a New Jersey resident;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.xpd?id=111-h20090603-55 Rep Chrsi Smith: On Sean Goldman - Justice Delayed Again]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] treated the case as a diplomatic issue of Brazil's obligations under the Hague Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/12/134047.htm ''Return of Sean Goldman''] (Statement of Secretary of State Clinton, 2009-12-24)&lt;/ref&gt;  After nearly six years of litigation in Brazil, U.S. Senator [[Frank Lautenberg]] of [[New Jersey]] placed a hold on a trade bill which allows certain countries, including Brazil, to export certain products to the United States duty-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-5995670-503544.html | work=CBS News | first=Brian | last=Montopoli | title=David Goldman Custody Battle Leads to Block of Trade Bill | date=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Days later, by a decision of [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Brazil's Supreme Court]], Sean was handed over to his father on December 24, 2009.

====Chile====
[[File:Coat of arms of Chile.svg|right|100px]]
[[Chile]] signed the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] in 1994 and it entered into force with the United States in the same year.  The [[US Department of State]] has denoted Chile as a country demonstrating "patterns of noncompliance" or a "not fully compliant" with the Hague Abduction Convention every year during the five period between 2005 and 2009 for its judicial Performance.  
Chilean courts delay Convention cases and often improperly treat them as [[child custody]] decisions, citing the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. U.S. parents often experience bias by the courts in favor of Chilean parents, especially Chilean mothers. In addition, it is customary in Chilean courts to order psychological or social evaluations in all cases involving minor children, regardless of whether there is evidence of possible risk to the child in being returned to his or her country of habitual residence. Because the Hague Convention focuses on returning a child to his or her country of habitual residence, the United States [[Central Authority]] takes the view that psychological evaluations are unnecessary, and cause inappropriate delays in processing cases, if there is no evidence of risk to the child should the court order the child’s return.

Another trend is for Chilean courts to deny Convention applications upon finding that the child is well settled in the new environment. This result, which could be avoided if Chilean courts handled Convention cases more expeditiously, leaves the victim parent with the much less desirable option of filing an application under the Convention for mere access to the child, or for visitation, and even these applications in some cases have not resulted in contact between the left behind family and the child. In 2008, a Chilean court ordered a scheduled access visit by the LBP, and the left behind parent purchased and confirmed his plane ticket and accommodations for the trip. Hours before the parent was scheduled to board the plane for Chile, the Chilean Central Authority notified him that the Chilean judge had suspended the scheduled visitation.  In April 2008, the Chilean Central Authority sponsored a seminar on the Convention and its application in Chile, including topics such as the emotional impact of international child abduction on children and parents, and the role of “network judges” in promoting the correct application of the Convention in Chile.  Several months after the seminar, the Chilean Supreme Court designated a family court judge to serve as Chile’s network judge for Convention cases.

====Colombia====
[[File:Coat of arms of Colombia.svg|right|100px]]

The Hague Abduction Conventionentered into force in Colombia in 1996. According to the Convention Compliance Reports, Colombia ranks as one of the top ten destinations for the abduction of children from the United States. It has also been cited several times as a country demonstrating "patterns of noncompliance," being totally "noncompliant" and a "country of concern". In cases involving the Abduction Convention, recent legislation by the Colombian Congress has placed jurisdiction with the family courts. In remote areas of the country where there are no family courts, Hague Convention cases are heard by civil court circuit judges.  While Colombian courts can recognize or enforce U.S. custody orders, they generally refuse to do so and Colombian court orders prevail over foreign court orders.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Colombian courts favor parents of Colombian nationality and it is very rare for a court in Colombia to grant custody to a parent residing in the U.S. when there is a parent residing in Colombia.

International parental abduction is covered in the Colombian Penal Code as kidnapping, with circumstances that can increase or reduce the punishment. Colombia does not consider international parental kidnapping as an extraditable offense.

In contrast to United States requirements, a Colombian passport for a minor child can be obtained with only one parent's consent, though Colombia restricts the departure of Colombian children from the country when they are not in the company of both parents. Although this prevents misuse of a Colombian passport to abduct children from Colombia it facilitates abductions from countries like the United States who have no exit controls. If a parent wishes to prevent the issuance of a Colombian passport to their minor child, they  must submit a request to the Ministerio de la Proteccion Social, Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar (ICBF).  If the ICBF concurs with the parent's request, it will notify the Colombian passport office and Colombian Embassies and Consulates to place a hold on the issuance of a passport to the minor child.  Parents may only submit a request through ICBF, not through a Colombian Embassy or Consulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icbf.gov.co/icbf/directorio/portel/libreria/php/decide.php?patron=03 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406085525/https://www.icbf.gov.co/icbf/directorio/portel/libreria/php/decide.php?patron=03 |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/country/country_3057.html |title=MIG: International Parental Child Abduction Colombia |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Costa Rica====
[[File:Coat of arms of Costa Rica.svg|right|100px]]
Costa Rica has not ratified the Hague Abduction Convention and does not allow interstate enforcement of custody and visitation orders.&lt;!--would this be vice versa, i.e. the US not recognizing Costa rican court orders as well?--&gt; According to the US Department of state, Costa Rica is also well known to accept refugee applications from those mothers/fathers fleeing U.S. justice allowing abducting parents to claim some sort of legal problem with the US and seek asylum in Costa Rica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ticotimes.com/costa-rica/child-abduction-custody-laws|title=Costa Rica, Child Custody and Abduction Laws |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All children born in Costa Rica acquire Costa Rican citizenship at birth and, to prevent international child abduction, may only depart the country upon presentation of an exit permit issued by immigration authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1093.html|title=Costa Rica Country Specific Information |publisher=ticotimes.com |accessdate=2010-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dominican Republic====
[[File:Coat of arms of the Dominican Republic.svg|right|100px]]

In December 1997, the [[U.S. State Department]] targeted diplomatic entreaties at eight countries whose accession to the [[Hague Abduction Convention]] the Department judged would be most useful and effective to the United States, one of these was the [[Dominican Republic]].

The [[Dominican Republic]] signed and ratified the Abduction Convention in 2004 and it entered into force with the United States in 2007.  Since the treaty went into effect the Dominican Republic ranks in the top ten list of countries that are the source and destination of abducted children between the United States.

In their 2010 Compliance Report, the State Department added an outgoing child abduction case with the Dominican Republic to their new "Notable Cases" section.  They noted the Dominican Republic's Central authority evinced an "incorrect understanding of various articles of the Convention" and that requests for clarification from their Central Authority did not receive any substantive responses.

====Ecuador====
[[File:Coat of arms of Ecuador.svg|right|100px]]
The Hague Abduction Convention entered into force between [[Ecuador]] and the United States on March 1, 1992. Over the years Ecuador has been cited in a number of Compliance Reports as a "noncompliant" country or a country demonstrating a "pattern of noncompliance."  In the year period covered by the 2010 Report there were 24 children abducted from the U.S. to Ecuador and 7 children abducted from Ecuador to the U.S.

Ecuador has demonstrated noncompliance both in its judicial performance and its [[Central Authority]] performance. Convention case hearings are excessively delayed, in violation of the Convention’s principle of
promptly returning children to their habitual country of residence. In addition, courts treat cases as custody decisions, rather than a determination of the appropriate jurisdiction to decide custody.  Having delayed proceedings themselves, the courts of Ecuador have been known to determine that, due to the delay, children have resettled in their new environment.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Efforts of the United States to communicate about cases with the Ecuadorian Central Authority (ECA) for the Abduction Convention have not been effective with ECA consistently being unresponsive to the US Central Authority's (USCA) requests for case updates and copies of court rulings. The USCA is not aware of any efforts by the ECA to train judges about the Convention.&lt;!--is that a requirement under the convention? if so, it adds to the strength of the point to add it--&gt;&lt;ref name="2008 Compliance Report"/&gt;

====Honduras====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2011}}
[[File:Coat of arms of Honduras.svg|right|100px]]
The Hague Abduction Convention entered into force between [[Honduras]] and the United States in 1994.  Honduras is the only country to be listed in every singled Compliance Report as non-compliant since the reports began in 1999. The implementation of the Hague Convention in Honduras is broken on every level. It has an executive branch and legislature that is, at various times, unsure if it has actually signed the Convention. Its [[Central Authority]] sometimes does not exist at all{{clarify|date=January 2011}} and when it is reestablished does not fulfill any of its roles and is chronically understaffed.  The judiciary demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the treaty and, even in the rare case that a return order is issued, it is not enforced.

In 11 years of reporting on Convention compliance in Honduras there has not been a single case where a return was judicially ordered and enforced.  Like with Mexico, would be abductors of children to Honduras can legally{{dubious|date=January 2011}} take children across the southern land border without the permission of the other parent or even a passport.

The [[Hague Abduction Convention]] entered into force between [[Mexico]] and the United States in 1991.&lt;ref name="Hcch.net"/&gt; Mexico is the number one destination for international child abductions from the United States and the United States is the number one destination for children abducted from Mexico. The [[U.S. State Department]] reports that 65% of all outgoing international parental abductions from the United States to Hague Convention countries are to Mexico, and that 41% of all incoming international parental abductions to the United States are from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=4109|title=SPEECH OF Ernie Allen President &amp; CEO National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children Child Abductions: Globally, Nationally and Along the US/Mexico Border|publisher=Missingkids.com|date=2009-08-31|accessdate=2010-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224040247/http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US&amp;PageId=4109#|archive-date=2010-12-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexico is the only country that has been found to be "Noncompliant, "Not Fully Compliant" or having a "Pattern of Noncompliance" in every single [[United States Hague Abduction Convention Compliance Reports|Compliance Report]] compiled by the [[US Department of State]] since they began in 2001.

One of the primary roadblocks to Mexico's successful implementation of the Hague Abduction Convention is its inability to locate children.  This issue has been cited numerous times in the US State Department's annual Compliance Reports. In some cases, the US State Department has reported providing Mexican authorities with detailed information on the whereabouts of abducted children including the exact address where they are living but Mexican authorities still report an inability to locate the children. In late 2009 the Mexican Central Authority gave a presentation at an international symposium on international child abduction where they cited improvements in this area as a result of turning over the responsibility of locating children to the Mexican Federal Police (AFI), rather than exclusively using Interpol who has no authority and must request the involvement of Mexican law enforcement to take any real measures in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/diplo/de/Aussenpolitik/InternatRecht/Downloads/RedeLopez.pdf |title=THE EXPERIENCE OF MEXICO ON INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION |author=Reyna Aurora Martínez López |accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of particular relevance to Hague Convention litigation in Mexico is the Mexican [[Amparo (law)|Amparo]], which translates to "protection" or "help." It is a Mexican legal procedure to protect constitutional rights that was incorporated into the 1847 national constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Acta de Reformas, art. 25 (1847) (amending Constitution of 1824).&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexico's "''recurso de amparo''" is found in Articles 103 and 107 of the [[Mexican Constitution]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.inquirer.net/express/07/09/03/html_output/xmlhtml/20070903-86232-xml.html The Mexican amparo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015062605/http://services.inquirer.net/express/07/09/03/html_output/xmlhtml/20070903-86232-xml.html |date=2010-10-15 }}, Joaquin G. Bernas, Inquirer.net. Accessed 20-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; Any Mexican citizen can file an amparo claiming that a Mexican authority is violating their constitutional rights.  Federal District courts are available in every state in Mexico and always have secretaries available to receive an Amparo.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}  In cases of international child abduction an amparo can be filed at any point and effectively blocks progression of legal procedures until it has been heard, often many months, or even years later. The decision in an Amparo trial can also be further appealed and multiple amparos may be filed during legal proceedings under the Hague Convention.

Corruption is an intrinsic part of the problem with international child abduction in Mexico and affects every other aspect of the issue from locating children and judicial decisions to enforcing court orders for repatriation in the rare cases where the obstacles of locating children and judicial noncompliance have been overcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegastribune.com//index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=683:judge-steel-opens-door |title=Judge Steel Opens the Door for Abduction |publisher=Las Vegas Tribune |date=2010-03-30  |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an Extradition Treaty between the United States of America and the United Mexican States (see 31 U.S.T. 5061) that, like many such treaties, provides for the extradition of a party who has been charged with or found guilty of an offense committed in one country. An offense is extraditable if it is a crime in both countries and punishable by incarceration for a period of one year or more. In theory this allows for the extradition of child abductors who have absconded to Mexico as child abduction is a federal crime there. In practice, US authorities rarely request extradition in preference of Hague Convention litigation, despite Mexico's gross noncompliance with the Convention and, even when they do, Mexico is not bound to deliver up its nationals and will frequently refuse to do so across the board, particularly in child abduction cases.

Additionally [[U.S.–Mexico border]] has the highest number of both legal and illegal crossings of any land border in the world.  Although the border is guarded on the United States' side by more than seventeen thousand border patrol agents, they only have "effective control" of less than 700 miles of the 1,954 mile border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Terence P. |last=Jeffrey |authorlink= |title=Administration Will Cut Border Patrol Deployed on U.S-Mexico Border |url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/54514 |newspaper= |publisher=Cybercast News Service |date=24 September 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209091814/http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/54514 |archivedate=9 December 2009 |df= }} and&lt;br/&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathon |last=Shacat |authorlink= |title=Fewer border agents in south |url=http://www.svherald.com/articles/2009/09/25/news/doc4abc7145ddcf8256922136.txt |newspaper= |publisher=The Sierra Vista Herald |date=25 September 2009 |accessdate=25 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In terms of international child abduction from the US into Mexico specifically, the problem of poor border security in general is compounded by the fact the United States does not have exit controls;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/family/abduction/prevention/prevention_560.html |title=US State Department: Child Abduction Prevention |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408015216/http://travel.state.gov/family/abduction/prevention/prevention_560.html |archivedate=2010-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; American children may be taken across the southern border of the United States without having the necessary documentation to get back into the country and there is no accounting for children taken across the border into Mexico, leading to thousands of missing children posters with the words "may have traveled to Mexico" on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/search?q=missing+"may+have+traveled+to+Mexico"|title=missing "may have traveled to Mexico" - Google Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Panama====
[[File:Coat of Arms of Panama.svg|right|100px]]
Panama’s performance in implementing the Convention was previously cited as “non-compliant”.  However, progress has been noted in Panama’s handling of its Convention responsibilities during the 2005 reporting period and the United States presently considers Panama to be “not fully compliant” in its implementation of the Convention.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/abduction/hague_issues/hague_issues_2952.html |title=2006 Compliance Report |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Venezuela====
The Hague Abduction Convention entered into force between [[Venezuela]] and the United States at the start of 1997. According to the compliance Reports, Venezuela was cited as a country "non-compliant" with the Hague Convention in 2006 and as demonstrating "patterns of noncompliance" in 2008 and 2009. The Venezuelan [[Central Authority]] typically failed to be responsive to inquiries regarding abduction cases by the [[United States Department of State]], the US Embassy in Caracas, or victimized parents. Venezuelan judges often misinterpret return and access applications under the Convention as a request for them to determine custody or visitation rights and have been  observed to have a nationalistic bias in favor of the Venezuelan parent.

In addition, despite return orders issued by lower courts, the abducting parents can and do take advantage of prolonged appeals processes to significantly delay the return of children. These delays are particularly pronounced in cases in which the left-behind parent can not afford to retain a private attorney.  Without the use of a private attorney, cases take very long.

==United States Government handling of abduction cases==

The United States government generally, and the [[U.S. Department of State]] specifically, have been subject to sustained criticism for not doing enough to prevent the abduction of American children or support American parents of internationally abducted children in their recovery efforts.&lt;ref name="HalfTruth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.uoregon.edu/faculty/mweiner/docs/halftruth.pdf |title=HALF-TRUTHS, MISTAKES, AND EMBARRASSMENTS: THE UNITED STATES GOES TO THE FIFTH MEETING OF THE SPECIAL COMMISSION TO REVIEW THE OPERATION OF THE HAGUE CONVENTION ON THE CIVIL ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONAL CHILD ABDUCTION |publisher=Utah Law Review |author=Merle H.

===United States Department of State===
{{further|Office of Children's Issues}}

American parents complain that they are essentially alone in dealing with foreign courts and legal systems.  The US State Department has a virtual monopoly on information in such cases, but refuses to act as a vigorous advocate for left-behind American parents while also preventing the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] or anyone else from playing that role. State Department attorney Thomas Johnson remarked that when he reminded one senior State Department official with Child Abduction Convention responsibilities that she works for the American people, her immediate response was: "I don’t work for the American people; I work for the Secretary of State",  demonstrating the Department’s inherent conflict of interest (i.e., a desire to maintain "good" bilateral foreign relations for their own sake that overrides assertive and effective advocacy on behalf of American citizens).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findthekids.org/pdf/johnson.pdf |title=THE HAGUE CHILD ABDUCTION CONVENTION: DIMINISHING RETURNS AND LITTLE TO CELEBRATE FOR AMERICANS |publisher=NYU Journal of International Law and Politics, 33 N.Y.U.

==== Dangerous Diplomacy ====

The journalist [[Joel Mowbray]] wrote the book "Dangerous Diplomacy" on the role and culture of the US State Department.  Mowbray's second chapter in "Dangerous Diplomacy", titled "Cold Shoulder: State's Smallest Victim's", is dedicated to an analysis of the assistance provided to American parents left in the wake of an international child abduction.  It describes State's overriding desire to appease foreign governments and maintain "good relations" as having a conflict of interest between their responsibility to internationally abducted children as the designated United States Central Authority under the Hague Convention.  This inherent conflict of interest between the two roles is magnified by what the book defines as the "culture of State", a culture characterized by extreme moral relativism, valuing process over substance and misplaced priorities that reward failures by promotions or high paying jobs "consulting" for the foreign government of the country that they'd previously been paid to advocate America's interests in.&lt;ref name="dangerous"&gt;{{cite book |title=Dangerous Diplomacy |author=Joel Mowbray |ISBN=0-89526-110-3|year=2003 |publisher=Regnery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[Bernard W. Aronson]], Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs (1989–1993)&lt;ref name="TLC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bringseanhome.org/Bernard_Aronson_testimony.pdf |title=Statement of the Honorable Bernard Aronson, Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs (1989-1993) |publisher=Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission |date=2009-12-02 |accessdate=2010-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"..the current system to secure the return of these abducted American children does not work and will not work unless it is changed profoundly.  I don't doubt the sincerity or the dedication of the professionals in the State Department who have lead responsibility for this problem, but they do not have the tools and powers to do their job effectively.  And unless Congress gives them the power and the tools we will be back here in five years or 10 years with another set of hearings, another group of parents with broken hearts and devastated dreams, and we will be making the same statements we are making today."

"the principal reason other nations, whether they are signatories to the Hague Convention or not, refuse to cooperate with the United States in returning abducted American children is that there are no real consequences for failing to do so."

"Let me be blunt, a diplomatic request for which there are no consequences for refusal is just a sophisticated version of begging.  And there are no consequences today for Brazil or any other nation which refuses to return American children."

In [[philosophy of science]], '''intertheoretic reduction''' occurs when a reducing theory makes predictions that perfectly or almost perfectly match the predictions of a reduced theory, while the reducing theory explains or predicts a wider range of phenomena under more general conditions. [[general relativity|Special relativity]],  for example, can be reduced to  [[Newtonian mechanics]] for velocities far less than ''[[Speed of light|c]]''.

According to [[Alexander Rosenberg]] philosophers mostly these days believe that reduction between sciences is possible ''in principle'' but concepts we currently have do not allow reductions even in many cases in which [[natural science]]s are involved, for instance from [[biology]] to [[chemistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Rosenberg - Philosophy of Social Science, second edition, page 140, published in 1995 by Westview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, the extent to which one theory can be said to be reduced to another theory is complicated by the existence of [[Emergence|emergent]] phenomena. Furthermore, there is the issue of by what criteria one judges one theory as more fundamental than another. Often, this notion is ambiguous. For instance, a quintessential example of intertheoretic reduction is often considered to be the reduction of [[phenomenological thermodynamics]] to [[statistical mechanics]]. However, it has been argued that there are some phenomena (e.g. phase transitions and critical phenomena) that cannot be reductively explicated in terms of the "more fundamental" theory of statistical mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Batterman, Robert (2009) Emergence, Singularities, and Symmetry Breaking.&lt;/ref&gt;

Especially [[psychology]] is seen often as a "scientific dead-end" due to its intentional concepts (though psychology does not necessarily have to use intentional concepts). Logical analysis has suggested that intentional concepts are not reducible to non-intentional concepts used by [[neurophysiology]] in which is the discipline "underlying" the psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg's book, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Hervey Wheeler''' (January 1, 1908 – July 6, 1978) was an [[African American]] bank president, businessman, civil rights leader, and educator based in North Carolina. Throughout his life, Wheeler was recognized for his accomplishments by various institutions across the country. John H. Wheeler started as a bank teller at [[Mechanics and Farmers Bank (Durham, North Carolina)|Mechanics and Farmers Bank]], and worked his way up to become the bank's president in 1952. In the 1960s, Wheeler became increasingly active in United States politics, carrying several White House positions appointed by Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Richard Nixon]], and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].

== Personal life ==
John H. Wheeler was born on the campus of [[Kittrell College]] in 1908, to John Leonidas and Margaret Hervey Wheeler. In 1935, he married, Serena Warren Wheeler and they subsequently had two children, Warren and Julia.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1978/07/08/jh-wheeler-lawyer-banker-advised-lbj-on-civil-rights-bills/a67df477-af4e-4247-b74f-e0e1110f5c2f/|title=J.H. Wheeler, Lawyer, Banker Advised LBJ on Civil Rights Bills|date=8 July 1978|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheeler died in 1978. In 2017, a bill was introduced into congress to rename the courthouse in [[Durham, North Carolina]] the ''John Hervey Wheeler United States Courthouse'' in recognition of his achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3460/text |title=Text - H.R.3460 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): To designate the United States courthouse located at 323 East Chapel Hill Street in Durham, North Carolina, as the "John Hervey Wheeler United States Courthouse". &amp;#124; Congress.gov &amp;#124; Library of Congress |publisher=Congress.gov |date= |accessdate=2018-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and banking career ==
John H. Wheeler began his academic career at [[Morehouse College]] in 1925. He graduated [[Summa Cum Laude|summa cum laude]] with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1929. In 1947, Wheeler graduated from the law school at the [[North Carolina Central University School of Law|North Carolina College for Negroes]] (now North Carolina Central University).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whospeaks.library.vanderbilt.edu/interviewee/john-hervey-wheeler|title=John Hervey Wheeler - Who Speaks for the Negro?|website=whospeaks.library.vanderbilt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also an active member of [[Omega Psi Phi]] fraternity, Beta Phi chapter.&lt;ref name="ncpedia.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncpedia.org/biography/wheeler-john-hervey|title=Wheeler, John Hervey - NCpedia|website=www.ncpedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning as a teller at [[Old North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company Building|the Mechanics and Farmers Bank]] in 1929, he rose to become president of the bank in 1952.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com"/&gt;

== Activism ==
The activism and leadership of John H. Wheeler thrived in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref name="ncpedia.org"/&gt; He was heavily involved in politics and education through various positions within the federal government and on various boards of trustees for institutions like [[Morehouse College]], [[Atlanta University]], [[Lincoln Hospital (Durham, NC)|Lincoln Hospital]], and the National Scholarship Service for Negro Students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://credo.library.umass.edu/view/full/mums411-b059-f004|title=National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students, 1955|website=credo.library.umass.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time serving in the White House, Wheeler devoted his time to the development of low-income housing, focused on race relations, and the elimination of poverty. He had working relationships with a number of United States presidents, John F. Kennedy,&lt;ref name="ncpedia.org"/&gt; Richard Nixon, and Lyndon B. Johnson, who invited him to assist in drafting the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. In 1956, John H. Wheeler was also the first African-American to bring an integration suit in the state of North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://soh.omeka.chass.ncsu.edu/items/show/301|title=Leroy Benjamin Frasier et alv Board of Trustees of the University of North Carolina, 1955 · The State of History|website=soh.omeka.chass.ncsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Negro College Fund (UNCF) ===

John H. Wheeler was an active member of the [[UNCF|United Negro College Fund,]] where he attended several meetings and convocations for decades. In March 1966 at the UNCF Role of Business Convocation, Wheeler delivered a powerful speech concerning the need for more training and opportunities for African-American scholars. Through UNCF, Wheeler was able to advocate for the need of higher educational opportunities for the black community.

[[Justice]] and the [[Market (economics)|market]] is an ethical perspective based upon the allocation of scarce resources within a society. The allocation of resources depends upon governmental policies and the societal attitudes of the individuals who exist within the society.  Personal perspectives are based upon ones circle of [[moral]] concern or those who the individual deems worthy of moral consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Laham. s.(2009). Expanding the Moral Circle: Inclusion and Exclusion Mindsets and the Circle of Moral Regard. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology'', 45(1). Pg. 250–253&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers, economists and [[politician]]s have sought to answer the question of which members of society deserve material rewards and how to decide what deserving is based upon. Perspectives of [[distributive justice]] vary from [[collectivism]] to extreme [[self-sufficiency]]; these perspectives vary between the importance of the group or individual respectively. Positions on distributive justice incorporate moral and [[political philosophies]] to form the extremes&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of philosophy. [online] Available at http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/ [accessed 21 May 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;  of [[communism]] (left wing) and [[libertarianism]] (right-wing) that exist on a continuum scale.

20th century philosopher [[John Rawls]] attempted to create a thought experiment that would allow for the consideration of a societal design that is best for all involved.&lt;ref name=rawls&gt;Rawls J. (1971) A Theory of Justice. Great Britain: J. W. Arrowsmith Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Mechanisms of redistribution vary among countries and governmental roles within societies determine the redistributive mechanisms that are used.

==Distributive Justice==
{{Main|Distributive justice}}

Distributive justice relates to the principle of fairness in the allocation of wealth, income, power and opportunities.&lt;ref name=one&gt;Sandel, M. J. (2009) Justice: What’s The Right Thing To Do? New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux
&lt;/ref&gt; Many theoretical paradigms have been developed to approach distributive justice such as Adam Smith’s [[invisible hand]], Karl Marx’s [[Socialist]] view of Communism and John Rawls [[Original position]] on Inequality.

==Libertarianism==
{{Main|Libertarianism}}

The Libertarian philosophy refers to freedom, and particularly individual liberty which dictates the right and ability to govern one's self.&lt;ref&gt;Three Theories of Justice. [online] Available at http://lilt.ilstu.edu/pefranc/3-ts%20of%20justice.htm [accessed 22 April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; In an economic sense the libertarian view assumes a [[free market]], left to its own accord, is a fair market and that redistributive taxation is unjust.&lt;ref&gt;Libertarian vs. Utilitarian Justice. [online] Available at http://www.philosophyetc.net/2005/06/libertarian-vs-utilitarian-justice.html [accessed 21 April 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; Many libertarian schools of thought exist with differing views on many principles, such as the role of government in the market place.

==Capitalist Society==
{{Main|Capitalism}}

[[Adam Smith]]'s idea of the invisible hand was a founding contribution to explain resource allocation within a society. The invisible hand metaphor portrayed an aggregated market created by the self-interest of those involved, and grounded in the notion that through fulfillment of one's own aspirations, society would benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A. (Ed.). (1976). The Theory of Moral Sentiments. Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A. (Ed.). (2007). An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations. Peterfield, Hampshire: Harriman House.&lt;/ref&gt; This idea formed the foundation of [[laissez-faire]] economic philosophy and subsequent [[neoclassical economics]], where [[Milton Friedman]]’s ideas about economic systems lay. The free market originated from the concept of the invisible hand, and eventuates in a [[Meritocracy|meritocratic society]] with resources allocated on the basis of merit. Modern representations of this exemplify perfect free market capitalism.

===Criticism of capitalism===
The invisible hand approach, or pure free market capitalism, assumes that a competitive market allocates resources in an appropriate manner, however Stephen LeRoy highlighted the debate that ensued following the recent financial crisis upon whether this assumption holds true for modern economies.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen LeRoy, Is the Invisible Hand Still Relevant. [online] Available at http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2010/el2010-14.html [accessed 16 April 2012].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thorstein Veblen]] in [[The Theory of the Leisure Class]] (1899)&lt;ref name=v&gt;Veblen. T. (Ed.). (2007). The Theory of the Leisure Class. New York: Oxford University Press Inc.
&lt;/ref&gt; argued that some wealth is [[conspicuous consumption|conspicuously consumed]] to display success to others. This proclivity to purchase luxury goods has been viewed as an inefficiency of the capitalist system. [[James K. Galbraith|Galbraith]]’s writings centered mostly, however, on the [[market power]] of large corporations. He posited that the power of corporations and their associated advertising, would make the markets espoused in [[classical economics|classical economic]] theory ineffectual, requiring a new economic theory to be developed.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith, J. K. (1998). The Affluent Society (40th Anniversary ed.). Boston: Houghton Mifflin.
&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Galbraith in turn objected to the fact that the focus of his writings were lay readers, as opposed to expert academics, implying that his answers to economic problems are too simplistic.&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, P. (1994). Peddling prosperity: Economic sense and nonsense in an age of diminished expectations. New York: W. W. Norton Inc.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social inequality]] and unfair [[distribution of wealth]], are often attributed to capitalism and a pure free market is built upon a principle of rewarding effort. However, this ignores persons born with greater natural abilities or greater opportunities.&lt;ref name=one/&gt; Thus, successive iterations of pure free market capitalism would lead to a market based upon feudal [[aristocracy]].

[[Price controls]] are a government initiative to mitigate exploitative market power. Specifically in response to systems of pricing that capitalise on the dependency of one market entity upon another, such as [[monopolistic]] markets in which the supplier is a price maker and consumers assume the role of price taker. Price controls as a strategy provide relief from the price exploitation of the dominant player in a market transaction, albeit a short term abatement of this power which is a common criticism of this method.

==Communist Society==
{{Main|Communism}}

[[Karl Marx]] in [[The Communist Manifesto]] postulated that the era of feudal aristocracy and the capitalism experienced in 1847 at the time of its writing, would be replaced with communism, or as we now know it, a socialist society.&lt;ref&gt;Marx K. &amp; Engels F. (Ed.). (2008) The Communist Manifesto London:Pluto Press.
&lt;/ref&gt; Communists from a Marxian perspective are described as persons that understand the world and are enlightened to the interests of the proletariat. Marx surmised that the "dictatorship of the proletariat" &lt;ref&gt;Marx K. (2000) The class struggles in France. Moscow: Progress Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; refers to rule by the working class and would see the battle of [[democracy]] as won.

In this scenario members of a society share common ownership of the means of production and rewards from that production. The resultant society gains and allocates resources according to the quote "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs!".&lt;ref&gt;Marx K. (1937) Marx:Critique of the Gotha Program. Co-operative Publishing Society of 
Foreign Workers in the USSR: Moscow, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The communist approach eliminates [[scarcity]] in all respects, and represents a society from a pure collectivism school of thought, based upon the [[utilitarian]] moral perspective.

The impact of Marxist theories continues to this day, Alan Taylor &lt;ref&gt;Taylor A. (1967) Introduction in The Communist Manifesto. London, England: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; compares The Communist Manifesto to a holy script, being acted upon and quoted by supporters that do not know the source of their belief.

===Criticisms of the Communist Society===

====Utilitarianism====
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}

A Communist society utilises a utilitarian based moral approach as a means to preserve the society. In this system the rights of the collective are placed above the rights of individuals. The utilitarian paradigm represents "the greatest happiness principle" as theorized by [[John Stuart Mill]].&lt;ref&gt;Mills. J. S. (Ed.). (1979). Utilitarianism. Indianapolis: Hacket Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory holds that the best course of action is that which benefits the majority, and may require the sacrifice of some to maximise happiness overall.

====Motivation====
Within a Communist Society the sole purpose of production is in maintaining the subsistence of the collective{{cn|date=April 2018}}. Removing any role for self-interest also removes this incentive to exert effort by individuals because reward is not allocated proportionate to effort or in a meritocratic manner. Introduction of a rewards system (be it economic or otherwise) breaches the basis of the communist society, because reward places value on individual achievement. An additional criticism flows from Adam Smith's discovery of the effect of market signals on resource allocation. With no consumers to express demand, optimal resource levels cannot be maintained. Instead production occurs on the basis of need only and need is not measured by willingness to pay {{cn|date=April 2018}}.

==Meritocracy==
{{Main|Meritocracy}}

Meritocracy is an ideology founded in the works of [[Confucius]], whereby the allocation of rewards, positions and responsibilities is objective and upon the merit of an individual. Merit is predominantly assessed via examinations and evaluations,&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, D. and Sadovnik, l. R. (2002). Education and sociology: an encyclopedia. New York: Taylor &amp; Francis
&lt;/ref&gt; however a perfect meritocracy is near impossible to achieve. The attainment of a university degree is purportedly an example of a meritocratic system, however the inability to ensure equal opportunity to access university by all refutes this point. Inequalities exist in access to prior education, socio-economic factors and as Rawls argues natural abilities and talents. Criticism of meritocracy comes from the reproduction of traditional hierarchies and inequality, when merit is not awarded in a meritocratic manner but instead on the basis of opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Kidder, C. W. (2000). The Rise of the Testocracy: An Essay on the LSAT, Conventional Wisdom and the Dismantling of Diversity. Texas Journal of Women and the Law. 9(2). pp. 167 - 250.&lt;/ref&gt; Distribution based upon the arbitrary nature of desert faces criticism from [[egalitarianism]], that dictates justice without equality is futile and that equality in itself is the highest form of justice.

==The Original Position==
{{Main|Original position}}

[[John Rawls]] conceived the notion of ‘The Original Position’ based upon the thought experiment whereby participants must agree to a hypothetical [[social contract]] under a [[veil of ignorance]]. In this approach to the question of societal design, removal of the knowledge of particular abilities, tastes and position within society creates a veil of ignorance. The application of this veil in the thought experiment determines the basic structure of society subjectively, because knowledge of the outcome and participant’s subsequent position in the society is deprived. From this naive perspective, an evaluation of resource allocation can be made from a morally arbitrary point of view.
The veil of ignorance favours the selection of ‘the original position’ a point in between self-sufficiency and collectivism, whereby two fundamental principles of justice would be agreed upon.
# Equal rights to extensive basic liberties, compatible with a similar liberty for others.
# Social and economic inequalities that (a) work to the benefit of the least advantaged members of society and (b) attached to positions and offices available to all.&lt;ref name=rawls/&gt;

"They are the principles that free and rational persons concerned to further their own interests would accept in an initial position of equality as defining the fundamental terms of their association."&lt;ref&gt;Rawls J. (1971) A Theory of Justice. Great Britain: J. W. Arrowsmith Ltd. p.11&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Difference Principle===
{{Main|Difference principle}}

Rawls’ conclusion to the regulation of inequality, was a society based upon his proposed ‘difference principle’ - permitting inequalities that work to the advantage of the worst off. Not to be confused with [[trickle-down economics]], this compensates for the natural abilities of individuals through a redistributive exercise. The society that results is therefore fair on the basis of opportunity regardless of natural ability.

===Criticism of Rawls Theory===
Rawls arranged the fundamental principles of the Original Position in lexical priority: the liberty principle, fair equality of opportunity and lastly the difference principle. This prioritisation encounters criticism, as the importance of the first principle is awarded greater weighting and must be satisfied prior to subsequent principles. So whilst liberty is said to be the dominant principle, the difference principle that results from the acceptance of inequalities (the second principle) operates in violation of the first principle.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport J. (1996) A Critique of Rawls's Arguments for the Lexical Priority of Liberties. [online] Available at http://www.fordham.edu/philosophy/davenport/texts/priorlib.pdf [accessed 20 April 2012]. 
&lt;/ref&gt; This is exemplified by redistributive taxes as discussed by [[Robert Nozick]] in [[Anarchy, State and Utopia]] which criticises the use of this tax as a levelling mechanism, impinging upon an individual’s basic liberties, the mainstay of the original position's principles.

Three objections to the difference principle are identified by [[Michael Sandel]] as follows:
1. A decreased incentive to work when top tier earners are taxed proportionately greater than lower tier earners. Reaching an equilibrium point demonstrates the difference principle. At equilibrium, top tier earners are provided with enough incentive so to remain in their positions of employment and thus continue to produce benefits also received by bottom tier earners.
2. A Meritocratic allocation of reward.
3. Self-Ownership of one’s natural talents and abilities, violated by redistributive practises that treat these natural assets as public or communal.&lt;ref&gt;Sandel M. J. (2009) Justice: What's The Right Thing To Do? Episode 08: "WHATS A FAIR START?" [online] Available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcL66zx_6No. [accessed 5 April 2012].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redistributive mechanisms==
{{Main|Redistribution of wealth}}

Redistribution of wealth is attained through many forms such as [[taxation]], monetary policies, welfare and nationalisation of private enterprise. Taxation as a means to redistribute wealth seeks to establish a level playing field for its constituents. [[Sweden]] has one of the highest income tax rates in the world, which translates to a high level of social welfare in the areas of education, healthcare and pensions.&lt;ref&gt;Fouché G. (2008)[online] Where tax goes up to 60 per cent, and everybody's happy paying it Available at https://www.theguardian.com/money/2008/nov/16/sweden-tax-burden-welfare [accessed 21 April 2012]
&lt;/ref&gt; This is a mostly utalitarian form of society and results in a low [[gini coefficient]], a measure of equality of income 0.25.&lt;ref name=gini&gt;List of countries by income equality [online]  at [[List of countries by Gini coefficiency]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The United States of America]] has a relatively high gini coefficient opposed to Sweden of 0.41.&lt;ref name=gini/&gt; As such the USA faces a problematic history in [[public sector]] services. Accessibility issues exist in healthcare and education in particular. [[Private sector]] ownership of these services advantage those that can afford it and for those that cannot, inequality is exacerbated further.

==Inequality of Wealth==
The inequality of wealth distribution in the United States was the precursor to the [[Occupy Wall Street Movement]] that spread to up to 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;Adbusters [online] Available at http://www.adbusters.org/campaigns/occupywallstreet [accessed 20 April 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; The protest’s slogan "[[We are the 99%]]" aimed to draw attention to the financial power held by a minority. This power is perpetuated by the supposedly corrupt nature of large corporations said to hold overwhelming financial and political control.

A [[poverty trap]], acts as a self-reinforcing mechanism which causes poverty to persist. This vicious cycle of poverty remains a common experience of billions and the emergence of these traps can arise from both market failure and institution failure.&lt;ref&gt;Azariadis C. &amp; Stachurski J. (2005). Poverty Traps. In Aghion P. and Durlauf S. The Handbook of Economic Growth Volume 1A. Amsterdam, Holland: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; On the opposite side to poverty traps are [[welfare trap]]s, or an over-reliance upon welfare, that creates a [[perverse incentive]] to work.

[[Market failures]] are the inefficient allocation of goods and services, that can occur in a free market economy. These failures often arise in the pursuit of goals of self-interest that lead to inefficient market outcomes such as Veblen’s theory of conspicuous consumption.&lt;ref name=v/&gt;

Kuranishi structure was introduced by Japanese mathematicians [[Kenji Fukaya]] and Kaoru Ono in the study of [[Gromov–Witten invariants]] in symplectic geometry and named after [[Masatake Kuranishi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fukaya |first=K. |last2=Ono |first2=K. |title=Arnold Conjecture and Gromov–Witten Invariant |journal=[[Topology (journal)|Topology]] |volume=38 |year=1999 |issue=5 |pages=933–1048 |doi=10.1016/S0040-9383(98)00042-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Let &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; be a compact [[metrizable]] topological space. Let &lt;math&gt; p \in X &lt;/math&gt; be a point. A '''Kuranishi neighborhood''' of &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; (of dimension &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;) is a 5-tuple

:::&lt;math&gt; K_p = (U_p, E_p, S_p, \psi_p, F_p) &lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt; U_p &lt;/math&gt; is a smooth [[orbifold]];
* &lt;math&gt; E_p \to U_p &lt;/math&gt; is a smooth orbifold vector bundle;
* &lt;math&gt; S_p: U_p \to E_p &lt;/math&gt; is a smooth section;
* &lt;math&gt; \psi_p: S_p^{-1}(0) \to X &lt;/math&gt; is a continuous map and is homeomorphic onto its image &lt;math&gt; F_p \subset X &lt;/math&gt;.

They should satisfy that &lt;math&gt; \dim U_p - \operatorname{rank} E_p = k &lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt; p, q \in X &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; K_p = (U_p, E_p, S_p, \psi_p, F_p) &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; K_q = (U_q, E_q, S_q, \psi_q, F_q) &lt;/math&gt; are their Kuranishi neighborhoods respectively, then a '''coordinate change''' from &lt;math&gt; K_q &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; K_p &lt;/math&gt; is a triple

:::&lt;math&gt; T_{pq} = ( U_{pq}, \phi_{pq}, \hat\phi_{pq}) &lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt; U_{pq} \subset U_q &lt;/math&gt; is an open sub-orbifold;
* &lt;math&gt; \phi_{pq}: U_{pq} \to U_p &lt;/math&gt; is an orbifold embedding;
* &lt;math&gt; \hat\phi_{pq}: E_q|_{U_{pq}} \to E_p &lt;/math&gt; is an orbifold vector bundle embedding which covers &lt;math&gt; \phi_{pq} &lt;/math&gt;.

In addition, they must satisfy the compatibility condition:

* &lt;math&gt; S_p \circ \phi_{pq} = \hat\phi_{pq} \circ S_q|_{U_{pq}} &lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt; \psi_p \circ \phi_{pq}|_{S_q^{-1}(0) \cap U_{pq}} = \psi_q|_{S_q^{-1}(0)\cap U_{pq}} &lt;/math&gt;.

A '''Kuranishi structure''' on &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; of dimension &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; is a collection

::: &lt;math&gt; \Big( \{ K_p = (U_p, E_p, S_p, \psi_p, F_p) \ |\ p \in X \},\ \{ T_{pq} = (U_{pq}, \phi_{pq}, \hat\phi_{pq} ) \ |\ p \in X,\ q \in F_p\} \Big)&lt;/math&gt;

where

* &lt;math&gt; K_p &lt;/math&gt; is a Kuranishi neighborhood of &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; of dimension &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt; T_{pq} &lt;/math&gt; is a coordinate change from &lt;math&gt; K_q &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; K_p &lt;/math&gt;.

In addition, the coordinate changes must satisfy the '''cocycle condition''', namely, whenever &lt;math&gt; q\in F_p,\ r \in F_q &lt;/math&gt;, we require that

::: &lt;math&gt; \phi_{pq} \circ \phi_{qr} = \phi_{pr},\ \hat\phi_{pq} \circ \hat\phi_{qr} = \hat\phi_{pr} &lt;/math&gt;

over the regions where both sides are defined.

==History==

In [[Gromov–Witten invariant|Gromov–Witten theory]], one needs to define integration over the moduli space of stable maps &lt;math&gt; \overline{\mathcal M}_{g, n} (X, A) &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;McDuff, D and Salamon, D. "J-holomorphic curves and symplectic topology", ''American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publications'', 52. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2004, {{isbn|0-8218-3485-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are maps &lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt; from a nodal Riemann surface with genus &lt;math&gt; g &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; marked points into a [[symplectic manifold]] &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt;, such that each component satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equation

::: &lt;math&gt; \overline\partial_J u  = 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

If the moduli space is a smooth, compact, oriented manifold or orbifold, then the integration (or a [[fundamental class]]) can be defined. When the symplectic manifold &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is '''semi-positive''', this is indeed the case (except for codimension 2 boundaries of the moduli space) if the [[almost complex structure]] &lt;math&gt; J &lt;/math&gt; is perturbed generically. However, when &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is not semi-positive, the moduli space may contain configurations for which one component is a multiple cover of a holomorphic sphere &lt;math&gt; u: S^2 \to X &lt;/math&gt; whose intersection with the first [[Chern class]] of &lt;math&gt; X &lt;/math&gt; is negative. Such configurations make the moduli space very singular so a fundamental class cannot be defined in the usual way.

The notion of Kuranishi structure was a way of defining a '''[[virtual fundamental cycle]]''', which plays the same role as a fundamental cycle when the moduli space is cut out transversely. It was first used by Fukaya and Ono in defining the Gromov–Witten invariants and Floer homology, and was further developed when Fukaya, Oh, Ohta, Ono studied the [[Floer homology|Lagrangian intersection Floer theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Fukaya, K., Oh, Y.-G., Ohta, H. and Ono, K., "Lagrangian intersection Floer theory: anomaly and obstruction, Part I and Part II", ''AMS/IP Studies in Advanced Mathematics'', 46, American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI; International Press, Somerville, MA, 2009. {{isbn|978-0-8218-4836-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marginal demand'''  in [[economics]] is the change in demand for a product or service in response to a specific change in its price.

Normally, as prices for goods or service rise, demand falls, and conversely, as prices for goods or services fall, demand rises.

A product or service where price changes cause a relatively big change in demand is said to have ''elastic'' demand. A product or service where price changes cause a relatively small change in demand is said to have  ''inelastic'' demand. See [[Elasticity of demand]].

'''Mark Dion''' (born August 28, 1961) is an American [[conceptual artist]]. best known for his use of scientific presentations in his installations.

Dion earned a BFA in 1986 from the Hartford Art School at the [[University of Hartford]], Connecticut, and was also awarded an honorary doctorate in 2003. Presently, Dion lives and works in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Pennsylvania]] with his wife, the artist Dana Sherwood.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/dion/index.html Mark Dion in "art:21"] {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dion is currently a mentor at Columbia University in New York and co-director of Mildred's Lane, a visual art education and residency program in Beach Lake, Pennsylvania.

Dion is the subject of a monograph published by [[Phaidon Press|Phaidon]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artbook.com/9780714836591.html&lt;/ref&gt; and a documentary on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series, ''art:21''.&lt;ref name=art21&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/dion/index.html "Mark Dion Biography"], ''art:21'', 2007. Retrieved January 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Dion's work was included in [[Documenta|dOCUMENTA 13]], curated by Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev in Kassel, Germany, and has also been exhibited at MoMA PS1 in New York, [[Guggenheim Bilbao]], [[Minneapolis Institute of Art]], [[Tate Gallery]], and the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

Perhaps his best-known work is the ''[[Neukom Vivarium]]'', an installation in [[Olympic Sculpture Park]] in Seattle, WA. The artist has also completed other public commissions which include Den, a site-specific installation for the National Tourist Routes in Norway (2012), An Archaeology of Knowledge for Johns Hopkins University (2012), and Ship in a Bottle for Port of Los Angeles Waterfront (2011).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Dion has received the ninth annual Larry Aldrich Foundation Award (2001), The Joan Mitchell Foundation Award (2007), and the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Lucida Art Award (2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1679">In psychology and [[neuroscience]], '''motor planning''' is a set of processes related to the preparation of a movement that occurs during the [[reaction time]] (the time between the presentation of a stimulus to a person and that person's initiation of a motor response). Colloquially, the term applies to any process involved in the preparation of a movement during the reaction time, including perception-related and action-related processes. For example, the identification of a task-relevant stimulus is captured by the usual meaning of the term, “motor planning”, but this identification process is not strictly motor-related. Wong and colleagues (2015) have proposed a narrower definition to include only movement-related processes: "Specification of the movement trajectory for the desired action, a description of how the [[Wikt:end-effector|end-effector]] will produce such an action, and finally a description of the full set of the joint trajectories or muscle activations required to execute the movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wong|first=Aaron L.|last2=Haith|first2=Adrian M.|last3=Krakauer|first3=John W.|date=August 2015|title=Motor Planning|journal=The Neuroscientist: A Review Journal Bringing Neurobiology, Neurology and Psychiatry|volume=21|issue=4|pages=385–398|doi=10.1177/1073858414541484|issn=1089-4098|pmid=24981338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Penglai''' (Traditional Chinese: 蓬萊仙島 (''lit. Penglai Immortal&lt;ref&gt;The character 仙 literally refers to a Daoist holy person/immortal or a mythological being, but is often used to describe places which exhibit the qualities of these beings.&lt;/ref&gt; Island))'' is a legendary land of [[Chinese mythology]]. It is known in [[Japanese mythology]] as '''Hōrai'''.&lt;ref name="McCullough"&gt;[[McCullough, Helen]]. ''Classical Japanese Prose'', p. 570. Stanford Univ. Press, 1990. {{ISBN|0-8047-1960-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
According to the ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'', the mountain is said to be on an island in the eastern end of [[Bohai Sea]], along with four other islands where the immortals lived, called Fāngzhàng ({{lang|zh|方丈}}), Yíngzhōu ({{lang|zh|瀛州}}), Dàiyú ({{lang|zh|岱輿}}), and Yuánjiāo ({{lang|zh|員嬌}}).

Various theories have been offered over the years as to the "real" location of these places, including [[Japan]], Nam-Hae (南海), Geo-Je (巨濟), [[Jejudo]] (濟州島) south of the [[Korean Peninsula]], and [[Taiwan]]. [[Penglai, Shandong]] exists, but its claimed connection is as the site of departures for those leaving for the island rather than the island itself.

==In Chinese mythology==
In Chinese mythology, the mountain is often said to be the base for the [[Eight Immortals]], or at least where they travel to have a banquet, as well as the magician [[Anqi Sheng]]. Supposedly, everything on the mountain seems white, while its palaces are made from [[gold]] and [[platinum]], and jewelry grows on trees.

There is no pain and no winter; there are rice bowls and wine glasses that never become empty no matter how much people eat or drink from them; and there are magical fruits growing in Penglai that can heal any disease, grant [[eternal youth]], and even raise the dead.

Historically, [[Qin Shi Huang]], in search of the [[elixir of life]], made several attempts to find the island where the mountain is located, to no avail. Legends tell that [[Xu Fu]], one servant sent to find the island, found Japan instead, and named [[Mount Fuji]] as Penglai.

==In Japanese mythology==
The presentation of Mt. Hōrai in [[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s ''[[Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things]]'', is somewhat different from the earlier idyllic Chinese myth. This version, which does not truly represent the Japanese views of Horai in the Meiji and preceding Tokugawa periods,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} rejects much of the fantastic and magical properties of Hōrai. In this version of the myth, Hōrai is not free from sorrow or death, and the winters are bitterly cold. Hearn's conception of Hōrai holds that there are no magical fruits that cure disease, grant eternal youth or raise the dead, and no rice bowls or wine glasses that never become empty.

Hearn's incarnation of the myth of Hōrai focuses more on the atmosphere of the place, which is said to be made up not of air but of "quintillions of quintillions" of souls. Breathing in these souls is said to grant one all of the perceptions and knowledge of these ancient souls. The Japanese version also holds that the people of Hōrai are small fairies, and they have no knowledge of great evil, and so their hearts never grow old.

In the ''[[Kwaidan]]'', there is some indication that the Japanese hold such a place to be merely a fantasy. It is pointed out that "Hōrai is also called Shinkiro, which signifies Mirage—the Vision of the Intangible".

Yet uses of Mount Hōrai in Japanese literature and art of the Tokugawa period (1615–1868) reveal a very different view than Hearn's Victorian-influenced interpretation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

{{Conservation status}}

A '''near-threatened species''' is a [[species]] which has been [[Conservation status|categorized]] as "'''Near Threatened'''" (NT) by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] as that may be considered [[Threatened species|threatened]] with [[extinct]]ion in the near future, although it does not currently qualify for the threatened status. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] notes the importance of re-evaluating near-threatened [[taxa]] at appropriate intervals.

The rationale used for near-threatened taxa usually includes the criteria of [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] which are plausible or nearly met, such as reduction in numbers or range. Near-threatened species evaluated from 2001 onwards may also be ones which are dependent on conservation efforts to prevent their becoming threatened, whereas prior to this [[conservation-dependent species]] were given a separate category ("Conservation Dependent").

Additionally, the 402 conservation-dependent taxa may also be considered near-threatened.

== IUCN Categories and Criteria version 2.3 ==
[[File:Status iucn2.3 NT.svg|left|Diagram of ''{{nowrap|Lower Risk{{\}}near threatened}}'' in the older IUCN version 2.3, beside the former ''{{nowrap|Lower Risk{{\}}conservation dependent}}'' subcategory.]]

Prior to 2001, the IUCN used the version 2.3 Categories and Criteria to assign [[conservation status]], which included a separate category for [[conservation-dependent]] species ("Conservation Dependent", LR/cd). With this category system, Near Threatened and Conservation Dependent were both subcategories of the category "Lower Risk". Taxa which were last evaluated prior to 2001 may retain their LR/cd or LR/nt status, although had the category been assigned with the same information today the species would be designated simply "Near Threatened (NT)" in either case.

'''Observational learning''' is [[learning]] that occurs through observing the behavior of others. It is a form of [[Social learning theory|social learning]] which takes various forms, based on various processes. In humans, this form of learning seems to not need [[reinforcement]] to occur, but instead, requires a social model such as a [[parent]], [[sibling]], [[friend]], or [[teacher]] with surroundings. Particularly in childhood, a model is someone of authority or higher status in an environment. In animals, observational learning is often based on classical conditioning, in which an instinctive behavior is elicited by observing the behavior of another (e.g. mobbing in birds), but other processes may be involved as well.&lt;ref&gt;Shettleworth, S. J. "Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior", 2010 (2nd ed.) New York:Oxford,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human observational learning==
Many behaviors that a learner observes, remembers, and imitates are actions that models display and display modeling, even though the model may not intentionally try to instill a particular behavior. A child may learn to swear, smack, smoke, and deem other inappropriate behavior acceptable through poor modeling. Bandura claims that children continually learn desirable and undesirable behavior through observational learning. Observational learning suggests that an individual's environment, [[cognition]], and behavior all incorporate and ultimately determine how the individual functions and models.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1971) "Psychological Modelling".New York: Lieber-Antherton&lt;/ref&gt;

Through observational learning, individual behaviors can spread across a culture through a process called ''[[diffusion]] chain''. This basically occurs when an individual first learns a behavior by observing another individual and that individual serves as a model through whom other individuals learn the behavior, and so on.&lt;ref name="Schacter D.L et al. 2011 295"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter, Gilbert, &amp; Wegner|first=D. L., D.T., &amp; D. M.|title=Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|pages=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Culture]] plays a role in whether observational learning is the dominant learning style in a person or [[community]].  Some cultures expect children to actively participate in their communities and are therefore exposed to different trades and roles on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Garton 2007 195–216"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garton|first=A. F.|title=Learning through collaboration: Is there a multicultural perspective?|year=2007|publisher=AIP|pages=195–216}}&lt;/ref&gt; This exposure allows children to observe and learn the different skills and practices that are valued in their communities.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Claire|title=Hughes, Claire. (2011) Social Understanding and Social Lives|year=2011|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York, Ny}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Bandura]], who is  known for the classic [[Bobo doll experiment]], identified this basic form of learning in 1961. The importance of observational learning lies in helping individuals, especially children, acquire new responses by observing others' behavior.[[File:Bobo doll 1.png|thumb|[[Bobo doll experiment|Bobo doll]]]] Albert Bandura states that people’s behavior could be determined by their environment.  Observational learning occurs through observing negative and positive behaviors. Bandura believes in [[reciprocal determinism]] in which the environment can influence people’s behavior and vice versa. For instance, the Bobo doll experiment shows that model, in a determined environment, affects children’s behavior. In this experiment Bandura demonstrates that one group of children placed in an aggressive environment would act the same way, while the control group and the other group of children placed in a passive role model environment hardly shows any type of aggression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most Human Behavior is learned Through Modeling|url=http://credoreference.com/content/entry/dkpsycbook/most_human_behavior_is_learned_through_modeling_albert_bandura_1925/0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In communities where children's primary mode of learning is through observation, the [[Child Integration|children]] are rarely separated from adult activities. This incorporation into the adult world at an early age allows children to use observational learning skills in multiple spheres of life. This learning through observation requires keen attentive abilities. Culturally, they learn that their participation and contributions are valued in their communities. This teaches children that it is their duty, as members of the community, to observe others' contributions so they gradually become involved and participate further in the community.&lt;ref name="Fleer 2003 64–79"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fleer|first=M.|title=Early Childhood Education as an Evolving 'Community of Practice' or as Lived 'Social Reproduction': researching the 'taken-for-granted'|journal=Contemporary Issues in Early Childhood|year=2003|volume=4|issue=1|pages=64–79|doi=10.2304/ciec.2003.4.1.7|url=http://www.uni-koeln.de/hf/konstrukt/didaktik/communities/viewpdf.pdf|citeseerx=10.1.1.486.6531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stages==
[[File:Skiing lesson at Flumserberg.jpg|thumbnail|right]]
Bandura's [[social cognitive theory|social cognitive learning theory]] states that there are four stages involved in observational learning:&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, Albert. "Observational Learning." Learning and Memory. Ed. John H. Byrne. 2nd ed. New York: Macmillan Reference USA, 2004. 482-484. Gale Virtual Reference Library. Web. 6 Oct. 2014. Document URL http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CCX3407100173&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=cuny_hunter&amp;it=r&amp;p=GVRL&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=06f2484b425a0c9f9606dff1b2a86c18&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Attention''': Observers cannot learn unless they pay attention to what's happening around them. This process is influenced by characteristics of the model, such as how much one likes or identifies with the model, and by characteristics of the observer, such as the observer's expectations or level of emotional arousal.
# '''Retention'''/'''Memory:''' Observers must not only recognize the observed behavior but also remember it at some later time. This process depends on the observer's ability to code or structure the information in an easily remembered form or to mentally or physically rehearse the model's actions. 
# '''Initiation'''/'''Motor''': Observers must be physically and/intellectually capable of producing the act. In many cases the observer possesses the necessary responses. But sometimes, reproducing the model's actions may involve skills the observer has not yet acquired. It is one thing to carefully watch a circus juggler, but it is quite another to go home and repeat those acts. 
# '''Motivation''': The observer must have motivation to recreate the observed behavior.

Bandura clearly distinguishes between learning and performance. Unless motivated, a person does not produce learned behavior. This motivation can come from external reinforcement, such as the experimenter's promise of reward in some of Bandura's studies, or the bribe of a parent. Or it can come from vicarious reinforcement, based on the observation that models are rewarded. High-status models can affect performance through motivation. For example, girls aged 11 to 14 performed better on a motor performance task when they thought it was demonstrated by a high-status cheerleader than by a low-status model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = Maureen R. | last2 = Ebbeck | first2 = Vicki | last3 = Rose | first3 = Debra J. | year = 1992 | title = "Show and tell" in the gymnasium revisited: Developmental differences in modeling and verbal rehearsal effects on motor skill learning and performance | url = | journal = Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 292–301 | doi=10.1080/02701367.1992.10608745| pmid = 1513960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have even added a step between attention and retention involving encoding a behavior.

Observational learning leads to a change in an individual's behavior along three dimensions:
# An individual thinks about a situation in a different way and may have incentive to react to it.
# The change is a result of a person's direct experiences as opposed to being in-born.
# For the most part, the change an individual has made is permanent.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Maureen et al. (1998). Observational Learning and the Fearful Child: Influence of Peer Models on Swimming Skill Performance and Psychological Responses. 380-394&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on behavior==
[[File:Learning djembe.jpg|thumbnail|Learning to play Djembe.]]
According to Bandura's social cognitive learning theory, observational learning can affect behavior in many ways, with both positive and negative consequences. It can teach completely new behaviors, for one. It can also increase or decrease the frequency of behaviors that have previously been learned. Observational learning can even encourage behaviors that were previously forbidden (for example, the violent behavior towards the Bobo doll that children imitated in Albert Bandura's study). Observational learning can also influence behaviors that are similar to, but not identical to, the ones being modeled. For example, seeing a model excel at playing the piano may motivate an observer to play the saxophone.

===Age difference===
[[Albert Bandura]] stressed that developing children learn from different social models, meaning that no two children are exposed to exactly the same modeling influence. From [[infancy]] to [[adolescence]], they are exposed to various social models. A 2013 study found that a toddlers' previous social familiarity with a model was not always necessary for learning and that they were also able to learn from observing a stranger demonstrating or modeling a new action to another stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shimpi | first1 = Priya M. | last2 = Akhtar | first2 = Nameera | last3 = Moore | first3 = Chris | year = 2013 | title = Toddlers' Imitative Learning in Interactive and Observational Contexts: The Role of Age and Familiarity of the Model | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096513001318 | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 116 | issue = 2| pages = 309–23 | doi=10.1016/j.jecp.2013.06.008| pmid = 23896415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was once believed that babies could not imitate actions until the latter half of the first year. However a number of studies now report that infants as young as seven days can imitate simple facial expressions. By the latter half of their first year, 9-month-old babies can imitate actions hours after they first see them. As they continue to develop, toddlers around age two can acquire important personal and [[social skills]] by imitating a social model.

[[Imitation|Deferred imitation]] is an important developmental milestone in a two-year-old, in which children not only construct symbolic representations, but can also remember information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meltzoff | first1 = A | year = 1988 | title = Infants imitation after 1-week delay: Long -Term memory for novel acts and multiple stimuli | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 4| pages = 470–476 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.24.4.470 | pmid=25147404 | pmc=4137879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike toddlers, children of [[elementary school]] age are less likely to rely on imagination to represent an experience. Instead, they can verbally describe the model's behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1989). Social Cognitive Theory. In R. Vasta (ED.), Annals of child Development: Vol. 6. Theories of child development: Revised formulation and current issue (pp.1-60). Greenwich, CT : JAI Press&lt;/ref&gt; Since this form of learning does not need reinforcement, it is more likely to occur regularly.

As age increases, age-related observational learning motor skills may decrease in athletes and golfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Law | first1 = Barbi | last2 = Hall | first2 = Craig | year = 2009 | title = The Relationships Among Skill Level, Age, and Golfers' Observational Learning Use | url = | journal = Sport Psychologist | volume = 23 | issue = 1| page = 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Younger and skilled golfers have higher observational learning compared to older golfers and less skilled golfers.

===Observational causal learning===
Humans use observational Moleen causal learning to watch other people’s actions and use the information gained to find out how something works and how we can do it ourselves.

A study of 25-month-old infants found that they can learn causal relations from observing human interventions. They also learn by observing normal actions not created by intentional human action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meltzoff | first1 = A. N. | last2 = Waismeyer | first2 = A. | last3 = Gopnik | first3 = A. | year = 2012 | title = Learning about causes from people: Observational causal learning in 24-month-old infants | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 48 | issue = 5| pages = 1215–1228 | doi = 10.1037/a0027440 | pmid=22369335 | pmc=3649070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparisons with imitation===
Observational learning is presumed to have occurred when an organism copies an improbable action or action outcome that it has observed and the matching behavior cannot be explained by an alternative mechanism. Psychologists have been particularly interested in the form of observational learning known as imitation and in how to distinguish imitation from other processes. To successfully make this distinction, one must separate the degree to which behavioral similarity results from (a) [[Genetic predisposition|predisposed behavior]], (b) increased motivation resulting from the presence of another animal, (c) attention drawn to a place or object, (d) learning about the way the environment works, as distinguished from what we think of as (e) imitation (the copying of the demonstrated behavior).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zentall | first1 = Thomas R | year = 2012 | title = Perspectives On Observational Learning In Animals | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 126 | issue = 2| pages = 114–128 | doi=10.1037/a0025381| pmid = 21895354 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.401.6916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observational learning differs from [[imitative learning]] in that it does not require a duplication of the behavior exhibited by the model. For example, the learner may observe an unwanted behavior and the subsequent consequences, and thus learn to refrain from that behavior. For example, Riopelle (1960) found that monkeys did better with observational learning if they saw the "tutor" monkey make a mistake before making the right choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Riopelle | first1 = A.J. | year = 1960 | title = Observational learning of a position habit by monkeys | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology | volume = 53 | issue = 5| pages = 426–428 | doi=10.1037/h0046480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heyes (1993) distinguished imitation and non-imitative social learning in the following way: imitation occurs when animals learn about behavior from observing conspecifics, whereas non-imitative social learning occurs when animals learn about the environment from observing others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heyes | first1 = C. M. | year = 1993 | title = Imitation, culture and cognition | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 46 | issue = 5| pages = 999–1010 | doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all imitation and learning through observing is the same, and they often differ in the degree to which they take on an active or passive form. [[John Dewey]] describes an important distinction between two different forms of imitation: imitation as an end in itself and imitation with a purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewey|first1=John|title=Democracy and Education|date=1916|publisher=Macmillan Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imitation as an end is more akin to mimicry, in which a person copies another's act to repeat that action again. This kind of imitation is often observed in animals. Imitation with a purpose utilizes the imitative act as a means to accomplish something more significant. Whereas the more passive form of imitation as an end has been documented in some European American communities, the other kind of more active, purposeful imitation has been documented in other communities around the world.

Observation may take on a more active form in children's learning in multiple [[Child development of the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American communities]]. [[Ethnographic]] [[anthropological]] studies in Yucatec Mayan and Quechua Peruvian communities provide evidence that the home or community-centered economic systems of these cultures allow children to witness first-hand, activities that are meaningful to their own livelihoods and the overall well-being of the community.&lt;ref name="Alta Mira Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaskins|first1=Paradise|title=The Anthropology of Learning in Childhood|publisher=Alta Mira Press|pages=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; These children have the opportunity to observe activities that are relevant within the context of that community, which gives them a reason to sharpen their attention to the practical knowledge they are exposed to. This does not mean that they have to observe the activities even though they are present. The children often make an active decision to stay in attendance while a community activity is taking place to observe and learn.&lt;ref name="Alta Mira Press"/&gt; This decision underscores the significance of this learning style in many indigenous American communities. It goes far beyond learning mundane tasks through rote imitation; it is central to children's gradual transformation into informed members of their communities' unique practices. There was also a study, done with children, that concluded that Imitated behavior can be recalled and used in another situation or the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLaughlin | first1 = L. J. | last2 = Brinley | first2 = J. F. | year = 1973 | title = Age and observational learning of a multiple-classification task | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 9–15 | doi = 10.1037/h0035069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Apprenticeship===
[[Apprenticeship]] can involve both observational learning and modelling. Apprentices gain their skills in part through working with masters in their profession and through observing and evaluating the work of their fellow apprentices.Examples include renaissance inventor/painter Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, before succeeding in their profession they were apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Groenendijk | first1 = Talita | last2 = Janssen | first2 = Tanja | last3 = Rijlaarsdam | first3 = Gert | last4 = Huub Van | first4 = Den Bergh | year = 2013 | title = Learning to Be Creative.

===Learning without imitation===
[[Michael Tomasello]] described various ways of observational learning without the process of imitation in animals&lt;ref&gt;Tomasello, M. (1999). The cultural origins of human cognition. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press. 248 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[ethology]]):
Exposure- Individuals learn about their environment with a close proximity to other individuals that have more experience. For example, a young dolphin learning the location of a plethora of fish by staying near its mother.

* [[Stimulus (psychology)|Stimulus]] enhancement – Individuals become interested in an object from watching others interact with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spence | first1 = K. W. | year = 1937 | title = Experimental studies of learning and higher mental processes in infra-human primates | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 34 | issue = 10| pages = 806–850 | doi=10.1037/h0061498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased interest in an object may result in object manipulation, which facilitates new object-related behaviors by trial-and-error learning. For example, a young killer whale might become interested in playing with a sea lion pup after watching other whales toss the sea lion pup around. After playing with the pup, the killer whale may develop foraging behaviors appropriate to such prey. In this case, the killer whale did not learn to prey on sea lions by observing other whales do so, but rather the killer whale became intrigued after observing other whales play with the pup. After the killer whale became interested, then its interactions with the sea lion resulted in behaviors that provoked future foraging efforts.
* Goal [[emulation (observational learning)|emulation]] – Individuals are enticed by the end result of an observed behavior and attempt the same outcome but with a different method. For example, Haggerty (1909) devised an experiment in which a monkey climbed up the side of a cage, stuck its arm into a wooden chute, and pulled a rope in the chute to release food. Another monkey was provided an opportunity to obtain the food after watching a monkey go through this process on four separate occasions. The monkey performed a different method and finally succeeded after trial and error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haggerty | first1 = M. E. | year = 1909 | title = Imitation in monkeys | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Neurology and Psychology | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 337–455 | doi=10.1002/cne.920190402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peer model influences===
Observational learning is very beneficial when there are positive, reinforcing peer models involved. Although individuals go through four different stages for observational learning: attention; retention ; production; and motivation, this does not simply mean that when an individual's attention is captured that it automatically sets the process in that exact order. One of the most important ongoing stages for observational learning, especially among children, is motivation and [[Reinforcement|positive reinforcement]]{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}.

Performance is enhanced when children are positively instructed on how they can improve a situation and where children actively participate alongside a more skilled person. Examples of this are scaffolding and guided participation. Scaffolding refers to an expert responding contingently to a novice so the novice gradually increases their understanding of a problem. Guided participation refers to an expert actively engaging in a situation with a novice so the novice participates with or observes the adult to understand how to resolve a problem.&lt;ref&gt;Schaffer, David et al. (2010). Developmental Psychology, Childhood and Adolescence. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural variation==

[[Cultural diversity|Cultural variation]] can be seen by the extent of information learned or absorbed by children in non-Western cultures through learning by observation. Cultural variation is not restricted only to ethnicity and nationality, but rather, extends to the specific practices within communities. In learning by observation, children use observation to learn without verbal requests for further information, or without direct instruction. For example, children from Mexican heritage families tend to learn and make better use of information observed during classroom demonstration than children of European heritage.&lt;ref name="Cole"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cole|first=M.|title=Culture and early childhood learning|url=http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/pages/pdf/cole-hakkarainen-bredikyteangxp.pdf|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mejia-Arauz 2005 282–291"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mejia-Arauz|first=R.|author2=Rogoff, B. |author3=Paradise, R. |title=Cultural variation in children's observation during a demonstration|journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development|year=2005|volume=29|issue=4|pages=282–291|doi=10.1177/01650250544000062}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children of European heritage experience the type of learning that separates them from their family and community activities. They instead participate in lessons and other exercises in special settings such as school.&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, Barbara. "Cultural Variation in Children's Attention and Learning." N.p.: n.p., n.d. N. pag. PsycINFO. Web.
&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural backgrounds differ from each other in which children display certain characteristics in regards to learning an activity. Another example is seen in the immersion of children in some [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous communities of the Americas]] into the adult world and the effects it has on observational learning and the ability to complete multiple tasks simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Fleer 2003 64–79"/&gt; This might be due to children in these communities having the opportunity to see a task being completed by their elders or peers and then trying to emulate the task. In doing so they learn to value observation and the skill-building it affords them  because of the value it holds within their community.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2011"/&gt; This type of observation is not passive, but reflects the child's intent to participate or learn within a community.&lt;ref name="Garton 2007 195–216"/&gt;

Observational learning can be seen taking place in many domains of Indigenous communities. The classroom setting is one significant example, and it functions differently for Indigenous communities compared to what is commonly present in Western schooling. The emphasis of keen observation in favor of supporting participation in ongoing activities strives to aid children to learn the important tools and ways of their community.&lt;ref name="Cole"/&gt; Engaging in shared endeavors – with both the experienced and inexperienced – allows for the experienced to understand what the inexperienced need in order to grow in regards to the assessment of observational learning.&lt;ref name="Cole"/&gt; The involvement of the inexperienced, or the children in this matter, can either be furthered by the children’s learning or advancing into the activity performed by the assessment of observational learning.&lt;ref name="Mejia-Arauz 2005 282–291"/&gt; Indigenous communities rely on observational learning as a way for their children to be a part of ongoing activities in the community (Tharp, 2006).

Although learning in the Indigenous American communities is not always the central focus when participating in an activity,&lt;ref name="Mejia-Arauz 2005 282–291"/&gt; studies have shown that attention in intentional observation differs from accidental observation. Intentional participation is “keen observation and listening in anticipation of, or in the process of engaging in endeavors”. This means that when they have the intention of participating in an event, their attention is more focused on the details, compared to when they are accidentally observing.

Observational learning can be an active process in many Indigenous American communities. The learner must take initiative to attend to activities going on around them. Children in these communities also take initiative to contribute their knowledge in ways that will benefit their community. For example, in many Indigenous American cultures, children perform household chores without being instructed to do so by adults. Instead, they observe a need for their contributions, understand their role in their community, and take initiative to accomplish the tasks they have observed others doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Coppens, A., Alcala, L., Mejia-Arauz, R., Rogoff, B.|title=Children's Initiative in Family Household Work in Mexico|journal=Human Development|date=2014|doi=10.1159/000356768|volume=57|issue=2–3|pages=116–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learner's intrinsic motivations play an important role in the child's understanding and construction of meaning in these educational experiences. The independence and responsibility associated with observational learning in many Indigenous American communities are significant reasons why this method of learning involves more than just watching and imitating. A learner must be actively engaged with their demonstrations and experiences in order to fully comprehend and apply the knowledge they obtain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaskins|first=Suzanne|title=Open attention as a cultural tool for observational learning |url=http://kellogg.nd.edu/learning/Gaskins.pdf|publisher=Kellogg Institute for International Studies University of Notre Dame|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous communities of the Americas===

[[File:Poblado-maya-1.jpg|thumb|Mayan villagers]]
Children from [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous heritage communities]] of the Americas often [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|learn through observation]], a strategy that can carry over into adulthood. The heightened value towards observation allows children to [[Attention#Cultural variation|multi-task and actively engage in simultaneous activities]]. The exposure to an uncensored adult lifestyle allows children to [[Informal learning#American indigenous perspective|observe and learn]] the skills and practices that are valued in their communities.&lt;ref name="Hughes 2011"/&gt; Children observe elders, parents, and siblings complete tasks and learn to participate in them. They are seen as contributors and learn to observe multiple tasks being completed at once and can learn to complete a task, while still engaging with other community members without being distracted.

Indigenous communities provide more [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In|opportunities]] to incorporate [[Child Integration|children]] in everyday life.&lt;ref name="Barbara Rogoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|author2=Paradise, R. |author3=Arauz, R. |author4=Correa-Chavez, M. |title=Firsthand learning through intent participation|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|year=2003|volume=54|pages=175–203|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145118 |pmid=12499516|hdl=10400.12/5953}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in some [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] communities where children are given full access to community events, which allows observational learning to occur more often.&lt;ref name="Barbara Rogoff"/&gt; Other children in [[Mazahua people|Mazahua, Mexico]] are known to intensely observe ongoing activities.&lt;ref name="Barbara Rogoff"/&gt; In native northern Canadian and indigenous Mayan communities, children often learn as third-party observers from [[Storytelling|stories]] and conversations by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogoff|first1=Barbara|last2=Paradise|first2=Ruth|last3=Correa-Chavez|first3=M|last4=Arauz|first4=R|title=Firsthand Learning through Intent Participation|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|date=2003|volume=54|pages=175–203|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145118|pmid=12499516|hdl=10400.12/5953}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most young Mayan children are carried on their mother's back, allowing them to observe their mother's work and see the world as their mother sees it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Modiano,|first1=Nancy|title=Indian education in the Chiapas Highlands|date=1973|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York|isbn=978-0030842375|pages=33–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, children in Indigenous American communities assume the majority of the responsibility for their learning.

Children aged 6 to 8 in an indigenous heritage community in [[Guadalajara|Guadalajara, Mexico]] participated in hard work, such as cooking or running errands, to benefit the whole family, while those in the city of Guadalajara rarely did so. These children participated more in adult regulated activities and had little time to play, while those from the indigenous-heritage community had more time to play and initiate in their own after-school activities and had a higher sense of belonging to their community.&lt;ref&gt;Children's Initiative in Contributions to Family Work in Indigenous-Heritage and Cosmopolitan Communities in Mexico. (2014). 57(2-3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Within certain indigenous communities people do not typically seek out explanation beyond basic observation. This is because they are competent in learning through astute observation.  In a Guatemalan footloom factory amateur adult weavers observed skilled weavers over the course of weeks without questioning or being given explanations; the amateur weaver moved at their own pace and began when they felt confident.&lt;ref name="Barbara Rogoff"/&gt; The framework of learning how to weave through observation can serve as a model that groups within a society use as a reference to guide their actions in particular domains of life.&lt;ref name="J. Gee"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gee|first=J.|author2=Green, J|title=Discourse analysis, learning and social practice: A methodological study|journal=Review of Research and Education|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communities that participate in observational learning promote tolerance and mutual understand of those coming from different cultural backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Often, children in Indigenous American communities find their own approach to learning and assume most of the responsibility for their learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other human and animal behavior experiments==

When an animal is given a task to complete, they are almost always more successful after observing another animal doing the same task before them. Experiments have been conducted on several different species with the same effect: animals can learn behaviors from peers. However, there is a need to distinguish the propagation of behavior and the stability of behavior. Research has shown that social learning can spread a behavior, but there are more factors regarding how a behavior carries across generations of an [[animal culture]].&lt;ref name="Frith, Chris D. 2012"&gt;Frith, Chris D., and Uta Frith. "Mechanisms Of Social Cognition." ''Annual Review Of Psychology'' 2012; 63.: 287-313&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning in fish===
Experiments with [[ninespine stickleback]]s showed that individuals will use social learning to locate food.&lt;ref name="Frith, Chris D. 2012"/&gt;

===Social learning in pigeons===
[[File:Columba livia in Japan.JPG|thumb|Pigeon]]A study in 1996 at the University of Kentucky used a foraging device to test social learning in pigeons. A pigeon could access the food reward by either pecking at a treadle or stepping on it. Significant correspondence was found between the methods of how the observers accessed their food and the methods the initial model used in accessing the food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zentall | first1 = T.

===Acquiring foraging niches===
Studies have been conducted at the University of Oslo and University of Saskatchewan regarding the possibility of social learning in birds, delineating the difference between cultural and genetic acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/366/1567/969.full.pdf|title = Social learning in birds and its role in shaping a foraging niche|date = 2011|access-date = Jan 18, 2016|website = |publisher = |last = Slagsvold|first = Tore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong evidence already exists for mate choice, bird song, predator recognition, and foraging.

Researchers cross-fostered eggs between nests of blue tits and great tits and observed the resulting behavior through audio-visual recording. Tits raised in the foster family learned their foster family's foraging sites early. This shift—from the sites the tits would among their own kind and the sites they learned from the foster parents—lasted for life. What young birds learn from foster parents, they eventually transmitted to their own offspring. This suggests cultural transmissions of foraging behavior over generations in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Slagsvold | first1 = T. | last2 = Wiebe | first2 = K. L. | year = 2011 | title = Social learning in birds and its role in shaping  a foraging niche | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 366 | issue = 1567| pages = 969–977 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2010.0343 | pmid=21357219 | pmc=3049099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social learning in crows===
The University of Washington studied this phenomenon with crows, acknowledging the evolutionary tradeoff between acquiring costly information firsthand and learning that information socially with less cost to the individual but at the risk of inaccuracy. The experimenters exposed wild crows to a unique “dangerous face” mask as they trapped, banded, and released 7-15 birds at five different study places around Seattle, WA. An immediate scolding response to the mask after trapping by previously captured crows illustrates that the individual crow learned the danger of that mask. There was a scolding from crows that were captured that had not been captured initially. That response indicates conditioning from the mob of birds that assembled during the capture.

Horizontal social learning (learning from peers) is consistent with the lone crows that recognized the dangerous face without ever being captured. Children of captured crow parents were conditioned to scold the dangerous mask, which demonstrates vertical social learning (learning from parents). The crows that were captured directly had the most precise discrimination between dangerous and neutral masks than the crows that learned from the experience of their peers. The ability of crows to learn doubled the frequency of scolding, which spread at least 1.2&amp;nbsp;km from where the experiment started to over a 5-year period at one site.&lt;ref&gt;Cornell, H. N., Marzluff, J. M., &amp; Pecoraro, S. (2012). Social learning spreads knowledge about dangerous humans among american crows. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propagation of animal culture===

Researchers at the Département d’Etudes Cognitives, Institut Jean Nicod, Ecole Normale Supérieure acknowledged a difficulty with research in social learning. To count acquired behavior as cultural, two conditions need must be met: the behavior must spread in a social group, and that behavior must be stable across generations. Research has provided evidence that imitation may play a role in the propagation of a behavior, but these researchers believe the fidelity of this evidence is not sufficient to prove stability of animal culture.

Other factors like ecological availability, reward-based factors, content-based factors, and source-based factors might explain the stability of animal culture in a wild rather than just imitation. As an example of ecological availability, chimps may learn how to fish for ants with a stick from their peers, but that behavior is also influenced by the particular type of ants as well as the condition.  A behavior may be learned socially, but the fact that it was learned socially does not necessarily mean it will last. The fact that the behavior is rewarding has a role in cultural stability as well. The ability for socially-learned behaviors to stabilize across generations is also mitigated by the complexity of the behavior. Different individuals of a species, like crows, vary in their ability to use a complex tool. Finally, a behavior’s stability in animal culture depends on the context in which they learn a behavior. If a behavior has already been adopted by a majority, then the behavior is more likely to carry across generations out of a need for conforming.

Animals are able to acquire behaviors from social learning, but whether or not that behavior carries across generations requires more investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Claidiere | first1 = N. | last2 = Sperber | first2 = D. | year = 2010 | title = Imitation explains the propagation, not the  stability of animal culture | url = | journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 277 | issue = 1681| pages = 651–659 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2009.1615 | pmid = 19889707 | pmc = 2842690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hummingbird experiment===
Experiments with hummingbirds provided one example of apparent observational learning in a non-human organism. Hummingbirds were divided into two groups. Birds in one group were exposed to the feeding of a knowledgeable "tutor" bird; hummingbirds in the other group did not have this exposure. In subsequent tests the birds that had seen a tutor were more efficient feeders than the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Altshuler | first1 = D. | last2 = Nunn | first2 = A. | year = 2001 | title = Obeservational learning in hummingbirds | url = | journal = The Auk | volume = 118 | issue = 3| pages = 795–799 | doi=10.2307/4089948| jstor = 4089948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bottlenose dolphin===
Herman (2002) suggested that [[bottlenose dolphins]] produce goal-emulated behaviors rather than imitative ones. A dolphin that watches a model place a ball in a basket might place the ball in the basket when asked to mimic the behavior, but it may do so in a different manner seen.&lt;ref&gt;Herman, L. M. (2002). Vocal, social, and self-imitation by bottlenosed dolphins. In K. Dautenhahn &amp; C. Nehaniv (Eds.), Imitation in animals and artifacts (pp. 63–108). Cambridge: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhesus monkey===
Kinnaman (1902) reported that one [[rhesus monkey]] learned to pull a plug from a box with its teeth to obtain food after watching another monkey succeed at this task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kinnaman | first1 = A. J. | year = 1902 | title = Mental life of two Macacus rhesus monkeys in captivity | url = | journal = The American Journal of Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 173–218 | doi=10.2307/1412738| jstor = 1412738 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fredman (2012) also performed an experiment on observational behavior. In experiment 1, human-raised monkeys observed a familiar human model open a foraging box using a tool in one of two alternate ways: levering or poking. In experiment 2, mother-raised monkeys viewed similar techniques demonstrated by monkey models. A control group in each population saw no model. In both experiments, independent coders detected which technique experimental subjects had seen, thus confirming social learning. Further analyses examined copying at three levels of resolution.

The human-raised monkeys exhibited the greatest learning with the specific tool use technique they saw. Only monkeys who saw the levering model used the lever technique, by contrast with controls and those who witnessed poking. Mother-reared monkeys instead typically ignored the tool and exhibited fidelity at a lower level, tending only to re-create whichever result the model had achieved by either levering or poking.

Nevertheless, this level of social learning was associated with significantly greater levels of success in monkeys witnessing a model than in controls, an effect absent in the human-reared population. Results in both populations are consistent with a process of canalization of the repertoire in the direction of the approach witnessed, producing a narrower, socially shaped behavioral profile than among controls who saw no model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fredman | first1 = Tamar | last2 = Whiten | first2 = Andrew | year = 2008 | title = Observational Learning from Tool using Models by Human-Reared and Mother-Reared Capuchin Monkeys (Cebus Apella) | url = | journal = Animal Cognition | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 295–309 | doi=10.1007/s10071-007-0117-0| pmid = 17968602 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Light box experiment===
Pinkham and Jaswal (2011) did an experiment to see if a child would learn how to turn on a light box by watching a parent. They found that children who saw a parent use their head to turn on the light box tended to do the task in that manner, while children who had not seen the parent used their hands instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pinkham | first1 = A.M. | last2 = Jaswal | first2 = V.K. | year = 2011 | title = Watch and learn?

===Swimming skill performance===
When adequate practice and appropriate feedback follow demonstrations, increased skill performance and learning occurs. Lewis (1974) did a study&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Maureen et al. (1998). Observational Learning and the Fearful Child: Influence of Peer Models n Swimming Skill Performance and Psychological Responses. 380–394&lt;/ref&gt; of children who had a fear of swimming and observed how modelling and going over swimming practices affected their overall performance. The experiment spanned nine days, and included many steps. The children were first assessed on their anxiety and swimming skills. Then they were placed into one of three conditional groups and exposed to these conditions over a few days.

At the end of each day, all children participated in a group lesson. The first group was a control group where the children watched a short cartoon video unrelated to swimming. The second group was a peer mastery group, which watched a short video of similar-aged children who had very good task performances and high confidence. Lastly, the third group was a peer coping group, whose subjects watched a video of similar-aged children who progressed from low task performances and low confidence statements to high task performances and high confidence statements.

The day following the exposures to each condition, the children were reassessed. Finally, the children were also assessed a few days later for a follow up assessment. Upon reassessment, it was shown that the two model groups who watched videos of children similar in age had successful rates on the skills assessed because they perceived the models as informational and motivational.

==Neuroscience==
Recent research in neuroscience has implicated [[mirror neuron]]s as a neurophysiological basis for observational learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lago-Rodríguez | first1 = A. | last2 = Cheeran | first2 = B. | last3 = Koch | first3 = G. | last4 = Hortobagy | first4 = T. | last5 = Fernandez-del-Olmo | first5 = M. | year = 2014 | title = The role of mirror neurons in observational motor learning: an integrative review | url = | journal = European Journal of Human Movement | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 82–103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These specialized visuomotor neurons fire [[action potential]]s when an individual performs a motor task and also fire when an individual passively observes another individual performing the same motor task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rizzolatti | first1 = G. | last2 = Fogassi | first2 = L. | year = 2014 | title = The mirror mechanism: recent findings and perspectives | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 369 | issue = 1644| page = 20130420 | doi=10.1098/rstb.2013.0420 | pmid=24778385 | pmc=4006191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In observational [[motor learning]], the process begins with a visual presentation of another individual performing a motor task, this acts as a model. The learner then needs to transform the observed visual information into internal motor commands that will allow them to perform the motor task, this is known as visuomotor transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jeannerod | first1 = M. | last2 = Arbib | first2 = M.

In [[object-oriented programming]], the '''open/closed principle''' states "''software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification''";&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
|first=Bertrand
|last=Meyer

|isbn=0-13-629049-3
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
that is, such an entity can allow its behaviour to be extended without modifying its [[source code]].

The name ''open/closed principle'' has been used in two ways. Both ways use generalizations (for instance, [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] or delegate functions) to resolve the apparent dilemma, but the goals, techniques, and results are different.

==Meyer's open/closed principle==
[[Bertrand Meyer]] is generally credited for having originated the term ''open/closed principle'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Martin]] [http://docs.google.com/a/cleancoder.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0BwhCYaYDn8EgN2M5MTkwM2EtNWFkZC00ZTI3LWFjZTUtNTFhZGZiYmUzODc1&amp;hl=en "The Open-Closed Principle", &lt;cite&gt;C++ Report&lt;/cite&gt;, January 1996, pp. 1]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822033314/http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/ocp.pdf |date=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared in his 1988 book &lt;cite&gt;''[[Object-Oriented Software Construction|Object Oriented Software Construction]]''&lt;/cite&gt;. 

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
* A module will be said to be open if it is still available for extension. For example, it should be possible to add fields to the data structures it contains, or new elements to the set of functions it performs.
* A module will be said to be closed if [it] is available for use by other modules. This assumes that the module has been given a well-defined, stable description (the interface in the sense of information hiding).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=Bertrand|title=Object-oriented software construction|date=1988|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|isbn=0136290493|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

At the time Meyer was writing, adding fields or functions to a library inevitably required changes to any programs depending on that library. Meyer's proposed solution to this dilemma relied on the notion of object-oriented [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] (specifically [[implementation inheritance]]):

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
A class is closed, since it may be compiled, stored in a library, baselined, and used by client classes. But it is also open, since any new class may use it as parent, adding new features. When a descendant class is defined, there is no need to change the original or to disturb its clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=Bertrand|title=Object-oriented software construction|date=1988|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=New York|isbn=0136290493|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Polymorphic open/closed principle==
During the 1990s, the open/closed principle became popularly redefined to refer to the use of [[abstraction (computer science)|abstracted]] interfaces, where the implementations can be changed and multiple implementations could be created and [[Polymorphism (computer science)|polymorphically]] substituted for each other.

In contrast to Meyer's usage, this definition advocates inheritance from [[abstract base class]]es. Interface specifications can be reused through inheritance but implementation need not be. The existing interface is closed to modifications and new implementations must, at a minimum, implement that interface.

[[Robert C. Martin]]'s 1996 article "The Open-Closed Principle"&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Martin]] [http://docs.google.com/a/cleancoder.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=explorer&amp;chrome=true&amp;srcid=0BwhCYaYDn8EgN2M5MTkwM2EtNWFkZC00ZTI3LWFjZTUtNTFhZGZiYmUzODc1&amp;hl=en "The Open-Closed Principle", &lt;cite&gt;C++ Report&lt;/cite&gt;, January 1996] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822033314/http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/ocp.pdf |date=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the seminal writings to take this approach. In 2001 [[Craig Larman]] related the open/closed principle to the pattern by [[Alistair Cockburn]] called ''Protected Variations'', and to the [[David Parnas]] discussion of ''[[information hiding]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Larman, "Protected Variation: The Importance of Being Closed", &lt;cite&gt;IEEE Software&lt;/cite&gt; May/June 2001, pp. 89-91 ''[http://codecourse.sourceforge.net/materials/The-Importance-of-Being-Closed.pdf]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Overkill''' is the use of excessive force or action that goes further than what is necessary to achieve its goal. It implies that, while the goal was accomplished, there was [[collateral damage]] as a result. It may be a literal term referring to physical damage, though it is also used in colloquial conversation as a metaphor. An example is killing an ant with a sledgehammer.

==Nuclear weapons==
''Overkill'' is especially used to refer to a [[nuclear weapon|destructive nuclear capacity]] exceeding the amount needed to destroy an enemy.&lt;ref name="EOP, K1"&gt;&lt;http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/overkill&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is attested from 1946&lt;ref name="EOP, K2"&gt;"overkill." Online Etymology Dictionary. Douglas Harper, Historian. 31 Mar. 2009. &lt;Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/overkill&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; and was in common use during the [[Cold War]] era, referring to the [[arms race]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Both nations possessed (and still do) more than enough nuclear weapons to destroy one another many times over &amp;mdash; nuclear overkill.
The term for this was "pounding the rubble" or, as military officers sometimes joked, "pounding the [[ruble]]".

==In video games==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:2006-09-26_23h20m54.png|thumb|PC-Game - [[Alien Shooter 2]], [[Flamethrower]] Overkill]] --&gt;
Overkill is a common feature implemented in many video games, typically representing the fact that the damage a single attack inflicted on an enemy or player character far exceeded the character's remaining health points. In many [[first-person shooter]]s, starting with ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', overkilling a character results in "[[Gib (video gaming)|gibbing]]" - the character exploding in a shower of gore.

{{short description|Parable used in early Buddhism}}
The '''parable of the arrow''' (or 'Parable of the poisoned arrow') is a Buddhist [[parable]] that illustrates the [[skeptic]] and pragmatic themes of the ''Cula-Malunkyovada Sutta'' (The Shorter Instructions to Malunkya) which is part of the middle length discourses ([[Majjhima Nikaya]]), one of the five sections of the [[Sutta Pitaka]]. The Pāli text contains a number of ''[[Hapax legomenon|hapax legomena]]'' or otherwise obscure archery terms and these are generally poorly dealt with in English translations.

==Narrative==
The [[sutra|sutta]] begins at [[Jetavana]] where the monk Malunkyaputta is troubled by [[Gautama Buddha]]'s silence on the [[fourteen unanswerable questions]], which include queries about the nature of the cosmos and life after the death of a Buddha. Malunkyaputta then meets with Gautama Buddha and asks him for the answers to these questions, he says that if he fails to respond, Malunkya will renounce his teachings. Gautama responds by first stating that he never promised to reveal ultimate [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] truths such as those and then uses the story of a man who has been shot with a [[poisoned arrow]] to illustrate that those questions are irrelevant to his teachings. 

{{quote|It's just as if a man were wounded with an arrow thickly smeared with poison. His friends &amp; companions, kinsmen &amp; relatives would provide him with a surgeon, and the man would say, 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know whether the man who wounded me was a noble warrior, a priest, a merchant, or a worker.' He would say, 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know the given name &amp; clan name of the man who wounded me... until I know whether he was tall, medium, or short... until I know whether he was dark, ruddy-brown, or golden-colored... until I know his home village, town, or city... until I know whether the bow with which I was wounded was a long bow or a crossbow... until I know whether the bowstring with which I was wounded was fiber, bamboo threads, sinew, hemp, or bark... until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was wild or cultivated... until I know whether the feathers of the shaft with which I was wounded were those of a vulture, a stork, a hawk, a peacock, or another bird... until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was bound with the sinew of an ox, a water buffalo, a langur, or a monkey.' He would say, 'I won't have this arrow removed until I know whether the shaft with which I was wounded was that of a common arrow, a curved arrow, a barbed, a calf-toothed, or an oleander arrow.' The man would die and those things would still remain unknown to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cula-Malunkyovada Sutta: The Shorter Instructions to Malunkya (MN 63)|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.063.than.html|publisher=Access to Insight|accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

==Commentary==

[[Thích Nhất Hạnh]] comments on the way the parable of the poisoned arrow illustrates Gautama Buddha's anti-metaphysical views:

{{quote|The Buddha always told his disciples not to waste their time and energy in metaphysical speculation. Whenever he was asked a metaphysical question, he remained silent. Instead, he directed his disciples toward practical efforts. Questioned one day about the problem of the infinity of the world, the Buddha said, "Whether the world is finite or infinite, limited or unlimited, the problem of your liberation remains the same." Another time he said, "Suppose a man is struck by a poisoned arrow and the doctor wishes to take out the arrow immediately. Suppose the man does not want the arrow removed until he knows who shot it, his age, his parents, and why he shot it. What would happen? If he were to wait until all these questions have been answered, the man might die first." Life is so short. It must not be spent in endless metaphysical speculation that does not bring us any closer to the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nhất Hạnh|first1=Thích|first2=Philip|last2=Kapleau|authorlink1=Thích Nhất Hạnh|authorlink2=Philip Kapleau| title=Zen Keys|publisher= Three Leaves Press|year= 2005|page= 42|ISBN=9780385475617}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

Sangharakshita notes that "The important thing is to get rid of the arrow, not to enquire where it came from."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sangharakshita|first=|title=The Drama of Cosmic Enlightenment: Parables, Myths, and Symbols of the White Lotus Sutra|publisher=Windhorse Publications|year=1993|page=97|ISBN=9780904766592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parable is considered a teaching on being practical and dealing with the situation at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Dale Stuart|title=The Six Perfections: Buddhism and the Cultivation of Character|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2009|page=200|ISBN=9780195382013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Chris|title=Buddhism for Today|page=14|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1997|ISBN=9780199172412}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese sources==
The story is also preserved in two Chinese translations of Prakrit sources. 
* 箭喻經 ''Jiàn yù jīng'' (''Arrow Metaphor Sūtra''), T 1.26 (p0804a21), （二二一）中阿含例品 (Èr èr yī) Zhōng ā hán, Lì pǐn. Madhyāgama 221, Chapter on Examples. Translated from an Indic language (possibly Gāndārī) into Chinese by a Sarvāstivāda Tripiṭaka master, Gautama Saṅghadeva, from Kashmir in the Eastern Jin Dynasty ca. Dec 397 – Jan 398 CE. 
* 佛說箭喻經 ''Fú shuō jiàn yù jīng''&lt;ref&gt;''The Buddha’s Talk on the Arrow Metaphor Sūtra'') T 1.94 (p.0917c21). Translator unknown, dated only to the Eastern Jin Dynasty (317–420 CE)&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these uses different translation strategies. T 1.26 transposes the various archery terms into items and materials familiar to a Chinese audience; while T 1.94 uses transliterated Indic terms that do not match the Pāli in most cases. Thus the obscure Pāli terms remain largely obscure for now. A third Chinese text, ''[[Mahāprajñāpāramitāupadeśa]]'' (T 1509 at T XXV 170a8-b1) contains a paraphrase of this text.

{{Family law}}

'''Paternity law''' refers to body of law underlying [[law|legal]] relationship between a [[father]] and his [[biology|biological]] or [[adoption|adopted]] [[child]]ren and deals with the rights and obligations of both the father and the child to each other as well as to others. A child's paternity may be relevant in relation to issues of [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimacy]], [[inheritance]] and rights to a [[putative father]]'s title or surname, as well as the biological father's rights to [[child custody]] in the case of separation or [[divorce]] and obligations for [[child support]].

Under common law, a child born to a [[marriage|married]] woman is presumed under [[common law]] to be the child of her husband by virtue of a "[[presumption of paternity]]" or [[presumption of legitimacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richards|first1=Edward P.|title=The Presumption of Legitimacy|url=http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/Books/lbb/x650.htm|website=Law and the Physician|publisher=The Law, Science &amp; Public Health Law Site|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consideration of a possible [[non-paternity event]] (which may or may not include [[paternity fraud]]) these presumptions may be rebutted by evidence to the contrary, for example, in disputed child custody and child support cases during divorce, [[annulment]] or [[legal separation]].

In the case of a father not married to a child's mother, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction:
* a man may accept the paternity of the child in what is called an '''acknowledgment of paternity''', '''voluntary acknowledgement of paternity''' or '''affidavit of parentage''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Affidavit of Parentage|url=https://www.michigan.gov/documents/Parentage_10872_7.pdf|website=State of Michigan|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Establishing Paternity Voluntarily|url=http://www.masslegalhelp.org/children-and-families/acknowledging-paternity|website=MassLegalHelp|publisher=Massachusetts Legal Services|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the mother or legal authorities can file a petition for a determination of paternity against a putative father, or&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Establishing and Contesting Paternity|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/family_law/paternity.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=17 September 2017|date=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* paternity can be determined by the courts through [[estoppel]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parentage/Paternity|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp-parentage.htm|website=California Courts|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, when paternity is in dispute or doubt, [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]] may be used to conclusively resolve the issue.

==Overview==
{{see also|List of national legal systems}}

The legal process of determining paternity normally results in the naming of a man to a child's birth certificate as the child's legal father. A paternity finding resolves issues of legitimacy, and may be followed by court rulings that relate to child support and maintenance, custody and guardianship.

==Unmarried fathers==
Generally, under common law, a biological father has a legal obligation for the maintenance or [[child support|support]] of his biological offspring, whether or not he is legally competent to marry the child's mother.&lt;ref name=boy&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/06/us/court-tells-youth-to-support-child-he-fathered-at-age-13.html|title=Court Tells Youth to Support Child He Fathered at Age 13|publisher=New York Times (USA)|accessdate=2013-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In jurisdictions where there is no [[presumption of paternity]] there is a process for fathers to [[Recognition (family law)|recognise]] their children and become the legal father of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Rights of Unmarried Fathers |url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/putative.pdf |website=The Child Welfare Information Gateway |accessdate=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Married fathers==
In the United States, where a child is conceived or born during wedlock, the husband is legally presumed to be the father of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Singer|first1=Jana|title=Marriage, Biology, and Paternity: The Case for Revitalizing the Marital Presumption|journal=Maryland Law Review|date=2006|volume=65|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/mllr65&amp;div=21&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states have a legal process for a husband to disavow paternity, such that a biological father can be named as the parent of a child conceived or born during a marriage. In most states, any claim of non-paternity by a husband must be heard by a court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roberts|first1=Paula|title=Disestablishing the Paternity of Non - Marital Children|url=http://www.clasp.org/resources-and-publications/publication-1/0111.pdf|website=CLASP|publisher=Center for Law &amp; Social Policy|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a parents litigate a divorce case without raising the issue of paternity, in most states they will be barred from disputing the husband's paternity in a later court proceeding. Depending upon state law, it may nonetheless be possible for a man claiming to be the child's biological father to commence a paternity case following the divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Glennon|first1=Theresa|title=Somebody's Child: Evaluating the Erosion of the Marital Presumption of Paternity|journal=West Virginia Law Review|date=1999|volume=102|page=547|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/wvb102&amp;div=24&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal proceedings==
Where paternity of the child is in question, a party may ask the court to determine paternity of one or more possible fathers (called putative fathers), typically based initially upon sworn statements and then upon [[testimony]] or other [[evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rights of  Unmarried Fathers|url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/pubPDFs/putative.pdf|website=Child Welfare Information Gateway|publisher=Children's Bureau|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once paternity has been legally established, if the court finds that to do so would be contrary to the best interest of the child, in most U.S. states a court may deny DNA testing or decline to remove a husband from a child's birth certificate based upon DNA testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strasser|first1=Mark|title=Legislative Presumptions and Judicial Assumptions: On Parenting, Adoption, and the Best Interest of the Child|journal=University of Kansas Law Review|date=1996|volume=45|page=49|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/ukalr45&amp;div=11&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful application to the court results in an order assigning paternity to a specific man, possibly including support responsibility and/or [[Contact (law)|visitation]] rights, or declaring that one or more men (possibly including the husband of the mother) are not the father of the child. A disavowal action is a legal proceeding where a putative father attempts to prove to the court that he is not the father; if successful, it relieves the former putative father of legal responsibility for the child.&lt;ref name=disavow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.la.gov/legis/LawSearch.aspx|title=Louisiana Civil Code article 186 et seq.|accessdate=2013-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it could be the case where several putative fathers are fighting to establish custody. In such case. In the United States, a state may legally bar a third party from disputing the paternity of a child born within an intact marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 US 110, 109 S. Ct. 2333, 105 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1989)|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18282912377125168373|website=Google Scholar|publisher=Google|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some paternity laws assign full parental responsibility to fathers even in cases of women lying about contraception, using deceit (such as [[oral sex]] followed by self-[[artificial insemination]]){{cn|date=January 2016}} or statutory rape by a woman ([[Hermesmann v. Seyer]]).&lt;ref name=boy /&gt;

==Paternity and inheritance rights==
If the context of inheritance rights, it will be the heirs of the deceased person who are attempting to dispute or establish paternity.  In some states, DNA testing will be dispositive to establish paternity.  In many jurisdictions, however, there are a variety of rules and time restrictions that can deny inheritance rights to biological children of a deceased father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beugge|first1=Charlotte|title=Rise in wills disputes over illegitimate children|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/money-saving-tips/10106145/Rise-in-wills-disputes-over-illegitimate-children.html|accessdate=31 May 2017|publisher=The Telegraph|date=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mahapatra|first1=Dhananjay|title=How legitimate is an illegitimate child’s right to property|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/How-legitimate-is-an-illegitimate-childs-right-to-property/articleshow/15788019.cms|accessdate=31 May 2017|publisher=The Times of India|date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Meredith|title=Intestate Succession Rights and Children Born Out of Wedlock|url=https://civil.sog.unc.edu/intestate-succession-rights-and-children-born-out-of-wedlock/|website=UNC School of Government|accessdate=31 May 2017|date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the idea of harmony and the absence of hostility}}
{{POV lead|date=September 2018}}
[[File:2008. Донецк 122.jpg|thumb|The Kind Angel of Peace monument in the city of Donetsk, Ukraine, by Russian artist Peter Stronsky]]
'''Peace''' is the concept of [[friendship|harmonious]] [[well-being]] and freedom from [[hostility|hostile]] [[aggression]]. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of [[social conflict|conflict]] (such as [[war]]) and freedom from [[fear]] of [[violence]] between individuals or [[homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] (relatively foreign or distinct) [[social group|groups]].

Throughout history some of the most extraordinary and benevolent leaders have used peace talks to establish a certain type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of [[List of periods of regional peace|regional peace]] or economic growth through various forms of agreements or [[peace treaty|peace treaties]].  Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in de-escalation of rhetorical and physical conflicts, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.  The avoidance of [[war]] or violent [[hostility]] can be the result of thoughtful active listening and communication that enables greater genuine mutual understanding and therefore compromise.  Leaders often benefit tremendously from the prestige of peace talks and treaties that can result in substantially enhanced popularity.

“Psychological peace” (such as a peaceful thinking and emotions) is perhaps less well defined yet often a necessary precursor to establishing "behavioral peace."  Peaceful behavior sometimes results from a "peaceful inner disposition."  Some have expressed the belief that peace can be initiated with a certain quality of inner tranquility that does not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life for its existence.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/11559-world-peace-must-develop-from-inner-peace-peace-is-not Dalai Lama XIV: Quotable Quotes] Goodreads. Downloaded Sep 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  The acquisition of such a "peaceful internal disposition" for oneself and others can contribute to resolving of otherwise seemingly irreconcilable competing interests.

Because psychological peace can be important to Behavioral peace, leaders sometimes de-escalate conflicts through compliments and generosity.  Small gestures of rhetorical and actual generosity have been shown in psychological research to often result in larger levels of reciprocal generosity (and even virtuous circles of generosity).  Such benevolent selfless behavior can eventually become a pattern that may become a lasting basis for improved relations between individuals and groups of people.  Peace talks often start without preconditions and preconceived notions, because they are more than just negotiating opportunities.  They place attention on peace itself over and above what may have been previously perceived as the competing needs or interests of separate individuals or parties to elicit peaceful feelings and therefore produce benevolent behavioral results.  Peace talks are sometimes also uniquely important learning opportunities for the individuals or parties involved.

== Etymology ==
[[File:Beowulf - frithu sibb.jpg|thumb|Before the word 'peace' came into English lexicon, Anglo-Saxons used a phrase "friðu sibb" for '[[Peace treaty|pledge of peace]]']]
The term-'peace' originates most recently from the Anglo-French ''pes,'' and the Old French ''pais'', meaning "peace, reconciliation, silence, agreement" (11th century).&lt;ref&gt;Online Etymology Dictionary, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=peace&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 "Peace"].&lt;/ref&gt; But, ''Pes'' itself comes from the [[Latin]] ''pax'', meaning "peace, compact, agreement, treaty of peace, tranquility, absence of hostility, harmony." The English word came into use in various personal greetings from c.1300 as a translation of the Hebrew word [[shalom]], which, according to Jewish theology, comes from a Hebrew verb meaning 'to be complete, whole'.&lt;ref&gt;Benner, Jeff: Ancient Hebrew Research centre: http://www.ancient-hebrew.org/27_peace.html&lt;/ref&gt; Although 'peace' is the usual translation, however, it is an incomplete one, because 'shalom,' which is also cognate with the Arabic ''[[S-L-M|salaam]]'', has multiple other meanings in addition to peace, including justice, good health, safety, well-being, prosperity, equity, security, good fortune, and friendliness, as well as simply the greetings, "hello" and "goodbye".{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} At a personal level, peaceful behaviors are kind, considerate, [[respect]]ful, just, and tolerant of others' beliefs and behaviors — tending to manifest [[good faith|goodwill]].

This latter understanding of peace can also pertain to an individual's introspective sense or concept of her/himself, as in being "at peace" in one's own mind, as found in European references from c.1200. The early English term is also used in the sense of "[[Silence|quiet]]", reflecting calm, serene, and meditative approaches to family or group relationships that avoid quarreling and seek [[tranquility]] — an absence of disturbance or agitation.

In many languages, the word for peace is also used as a greeting or a farewell, for example the Hawaiian word [[aloha]], as well as the Arabic word ''salaam''. In English the word peace is occasionally used as a farewell, especially for the dead, as in the phrase ''[[rest in peace]]''.

[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]] in his research project which led to the book ''The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies'' (2011) maps the different meanings of peace in different languages and from different regions across the world. Later, in his ''Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture'' (2012), he groups the different meanings of peace into five peace families: Energetic/Harmony, Moral/Justice, Modern/Security, Postmodern/Truth, and Transrational, a synthesis of the positive sides of the four previous families and the society.

==Religious beliefs {{anchor|Religion}}==
[[File:Eiréné et Ploutos.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of [[Eirene (goddess)|Eirene]], goddess of peace in ancient Greek religion, with her son Pluto.]]
Religious beliefs often seek to identify and address the basic problems of human life, including the conflicts between, among, and within persons and societies. In ancient [[ancient Greek religion|Greek-speaking areas]] the virtue of peace was [[personification|personified]] as the goddess [[Eirene (goddess)|Eirene]], and in [[ancient Roman religion|Latin-speaking areas]] as the goddess [[Pax (goddess)|Pax]]. Her image was typically represented by ancient sculptors as that of a full-grown woman, usually with a [[cornucopia|horn of plenty]] and [[scepter]] and sometimes with a [[torch]] or [[olive branch|olive leaves]].

===Christianity===
[[Christians]], who believe [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] to be the [[Jewish Messiah]] called [[Christ (title)|Christ]] (meaning Anointed One),&lt;ref&gt;Benner, Jeff: Ancient Hebrew Research Center:http://www.ancient-hebrew.org/27_messiah.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; interpret Isaiah 9:6 as a [[Christian messianic prophecies|messianic prophecy]] of Jesus in which he is called the "[[Names and titles of Jesus in the New Testament|Prince of Peace]]."&lt;ref&gt;"For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, 'Prince of Peace'." [New International Version]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Gospel of Luke]], [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] celebrates his son [[John the Baptist|John]]: And you, child, will be called prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins, because of the tender mercy of our God by which the daybreak from on high will visit us to shine on those who sit in darkness and death's shadow, to guide our feet into the path of peace.

Numerous pontifical documents on the Holy Rosary document a continuity of views of the Popes to have confidence in the Holy [[Rosary]] as a means to foster peace. Subsequently, to the Encyclical Mense maio,1965, in which he urged the practice of the Holy Rosary, "the prayer so dear to the Virgin and so much recommended by the Supreme Pontiffs," and as reaffirmed in the encyclical Christi Matri, 1966, to implore peace, Pope Paul VI stated in the apostolic Recurrens mensis, October 1969, that the Rosary is a prayer that favors the great gift of peace.

===Islam===
[[Islam]] derived from the root word salam which literally means peace. Muslims are called followers of Islam. [[Quran]] clearly stated "Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah, hearts are assured" and stated "O you who have believed, when you are told, "Space yourselves" in assemblies, then make space; Allah will make space for you. And when you are told, "Arise," then arise; Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge, by degrees. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quran.com/13/28|title=peaceful quran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quran.com/58/11|title=peaceful quran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===
[[Buddhist]]s believe that peace can be attained once all suffering ends. They regard all suffering as stemming from cravings (in the extreme, greed), aversions (fears), or delusions. To eliminate such suffering and achieve personal peace, followers in the path of the [[Buddha]] adhere to a set of teachings called the [[Four Noble Truths]] — a central tenet in Buddhist philosophy.

===Hinduism===
[[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts contain the following passages:
{{quote|May there be peace in the heavens, peace in the atmosphere, peace on the earth. Let there be coolness in the water, healing in the herbs and peace radiating from the trees. Let there be harmony in the planets and in the stars, and perfection in eternal knowledge. May everything in the universe be at peace. Let peace pervade everywhere, at all times. May I experience that peace within my own heart.|[[Yajur Veda]] 36.17)}}

{{quote|Let us not concord with our own people, and concord with people who are strangers to us. Celestial Twins, create between us and the strangers a unity of hearts. May we unite in our minds, unite in our purposes, and not fight against the heavenly spirit within us. Let not the battle-cry rise amidst many slain, nor the arrows of the war-god fall with the break of day|Yajur Veda 7.52}}

{{quote|A superior being does not render evil for evil. This is a maxim one should observe... One should never harm the wicked or the good or even animals meriting death. A noble soul will exercise compassion even towards those who enjoy injuring others or cruel deeds... Who is without fault?|[[Valmiki]]|[[Ramayana]]}}

{{quote|The chariot that leads to victory is of another kind. 
:Valour and fortitude are its wheels;
:Truthfulness and virtuous conduct are its banner; 
:Strength, discretion, self-restraint and benevolence are its four horses,
:Harnessed with the cords of forgiveness, compassion and equanimity... 
:Whoever has this righteous chariot, has no enemy to conquer anywhere.|Valmiki|Ramayana}}

==Inner peace, meditation and prayerfulness==
{{main|Inner peace}}
[[File:Abbot of Watkungtaphao in Phu Soidao Waterfall.jpg|thumb|upright|Buddhist monk during meditation near Phu Soidao Nationalpark.]]
Psychological or inner peace (i.e. peace of mind) refers to a state of being internally or spiritually at peace, with sufficient [[knowledge]] and understanding to keep oneself calm in the face of apparent discord or stress. Being internally "at peace" is considered by many to be a healthy mental state, or [[homeostasis]] and to be the opposite of feeling stressful, mentally anxious, or emotionally unstable. Within the meditative traditions, the psychological or inward achievement of "peace of mind" is often associated with bliss and happiness.

Peace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress. In some meditative traditions, inner peace is believed to be a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various types of meditation, prayer, t'ai chi ch'uan ([[T'ai chi ch'uan|太极拳, tàijíquán]]), yoga, or other various types of mental or physical disciplines. Many such practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself. An emphasis on finding one's inner peace is often associated with traditions such as [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and some traditional [[Christian]] contemplative practices such as [[monasticism]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rKkJs-KHCakC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=essential+writings+of+christian+mysticism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjju8O3gOTWAhUm0IMKHZa0DnMQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Sighed%20for%20ecstatic%20peace&amp;f=false Essential Writings of Christian Mysticism] Page 163. 2006. By Bernard McGinn.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as with the [[New Age]] movement.

==Satyagraha==
{{Main|Satyagraha}}
Satyagraha ({{lang-sa|सत्याग्रह}} {{IAST|''satyāgraha''}}) is a philosophy and practice of [[nonviolent resistance]] developed by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]]. He deployed satyagraha techniques in campaigns for [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence]] and also during his earlier struggles in [[South Africa]].

The word ''satyagraha'' itself was coined through a public contest that Gandhi sponsored through the newspaper he published in South Africa, 'Indian Opinion', when he realized that neither the common, contemporary Hindu language nor the English language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions when he talked about his nonviolent approaches to conflict. According to Gandhi's autobiography, the contest winner was Maganlal Gandhi (presumably no relation), who submitted the entry 'sadagraha', which Gandhi then modified to 'satyagraha'. Etymologically, this Hindic word means 'truth-firmness', and is commonly translated as 'steadfastness in the truth' or 'truth-force'.

[[File:Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at a civil rights march on Washington D.C. in 1963.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and Mathew Ahmann, executive director of the National Catholic Conference for Interrracial Justice, at a civil rights march on Washington, D.C.]]
Satyagraha theory also influenced [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] during the campaigns he led during the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States. The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable. Therefore, it is contradictory to try to use violence to obtain peace. As Gandhi wrote: "They say, 'means are, after all, means'. I would say, 'means are, after all, everything'. As the means so the end..."&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Prabhu &amp; U. R. Rao, editors; from section [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/chap45.htm "The Gospel Of Sarvodaya"], of the book [http://www.mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm The Mind of Mahatma Gandhi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220083923/http://mkgandhi.org/momgandhi/momindex.htm |date=20 December 2010 }}, Ahemadabad, India, Revised Edition, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary quote sometimes attributed to Gandhi, but also to [[A. J. Muste]], sums it up: 'There is no way to peace; peace is the way.'

==Justice and injustice==
Since classical times, it has been noted that peace has sometimes been achieved by the victor over the vanquished by the imposition of ruthless measures. In his book ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]'' the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] includes eloquent and vicious polemics against the rapacity and greed of Rome. One, that Tacitus says is by the [[Caledonia]]n chieftain [[Calgacus]], ends ''Auferre trucidare rapere falsis nominibus imperium, atque ubi solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.'' (To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace. — Oxford Revised Translation).

Discussion of peace is therefore at the same time a discussion on the form of such peace. Is it simple absence of mass organized killing (war) or does peace require a particular morality and justice? (''just peace'').&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'',  p. 129, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
A peace must be seen at least in two forms: 
* A simple silence of arms, absence of [[war]].
* Absence of war accompanied by particular requirements for the mutual settlement of relations, which are characterized by terms such as justice, mutual respect, respect for law and good will.

More recently, advocates for radical reform in justice systems have called for a public policy adoption of non-punitive, non-violent [[Restorative Justice]] methods, and many of those studying the success of these methods, including a [http://cpcjalliance.org/themes/restorative-justice-working-group/ United Nations working group on Restorative Justice], have attempted to re-define justice in terms related to peace. From the late 2000s on, a Theory of Active Peace has been proposed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalpeaceandconflict.org/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace#.VbOntbNVhBc|title=The Theory of Active Peace|work=internationalpeaceandconflict.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725235108/http://www.internationalpeaceandconflict.org/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace#.VbOntbNVhBc|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which conceptually integrates justice into a larger peace theory.

==Long periods==
{{See also|List of periods of regional peace}}
The longest continuing period of neutrality among currently existing states is observed in [[Switzerland]], which has had an official policy of neutrality and general peace since 1815 (for {{age|1815|11|20}} years as of 20{{CURRENTYEARYY}}).  This was made possible partly by the periods of relative peace in Europe and the world known as [[Pax Britannica]] (1815-1914), [[Pax Europaea]]/[[Pax Americana]] (since 1950s), and [[Pax Atomica]] (also since the 1950s).

Other examples of long periods of peace are:
* the [[isolationism|isolationistic]] [[Edo period]] (also known as [[Tokugawa shogunate]]) in Japan 1603 to 1868 (250 years)
* [[Pax Khazarica]] in [[Khazar Khanate]] (south-east Turkey) about 700-950 AD (250 years)
* [[Pax Romana]] in the Roman empire (for 190 or 206 years).

==Movements and activism==

===Pacifism===
{{Main|Pacifism}}

[[File:Peace sign.svg|thumb|upright|A [[peace sign]], which is widely associated with pacifism]]
Pacifism is the categorical opposition to the behaviors of [[war]] or [[violence]] as a means of settling disputes or of gaining advantage. Pacifism covers a spectrum of views ranging from the belief that international disputes can and should all be resolved via peaceful behaviors; to calls for the abolition of various organizations which tend to institutionalize aggressive behaviors, such as the military, or arms manufacturers; to opposition to any organization of society that might rely in any way upon governmental force.  Such groups which sometimes oppose the governmental use of force include [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarchist]]s and [[Libertarianism|libertarian]]s.  Absolute pacifism opposes violent behavior under all circumstance, including defense of self and others.

Pacifism may be based on [[morality|moral]] principles (a [[deontological]] view) or [[pragmatism]] (a [[consequentialist]] view). Principled pacifism holds that all forms of violent behavior are inappropriate responses to conflict, and are morally wrong.  Pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and inter-personal violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found. Pacifists in general reject theories of [[Just War]].  Pacifism tends to place its initial focus on the need for a "peaceful behavior" ahead of any focus on the need for a "peaceful inner disposition."

===Organizations===

==== United Nations ====
[[File:United Nations peacekeeping missions 2009.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[List of UN peacekeeping missions|UN peacekeeping missions]]. Dark blue regions indicate current missions, while light blue regions represent former missions.]]
{{Main|United Nations}}{{See also|List of United Nations peacekeeping missions}}
The United Nations (UN) is an international organization whose stated aims are to facilitate cooperation in international law, international security, economic development, social progress, human rights, and achieving [[world peace]]. The UN was founded in 1945 after World War II to replace the League of Nations, to stop wars between countries, and to provide a platform for dialogue.

The UN, after approval by the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]], sends [[peacekeeping|peacekeepers]] to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities. Since the UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states of the UN. The forces, also called the "Blue Helmets", who enforce UN accords are awarded [[United Nations Medal]]s, which are considered [[international decoration]]s instead of [[military decoration]]s. The peacekeeping force as a whole received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1988.

====League of Nations====
The principal forerunner of the United Nations was the [[League of Nations]]. It was created at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference of 1919]], and emerged from the advocacy of [[Woodrow Wilson]] and other idealists during World War I. The Covenant of the League of Nations was included in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919, and the League was based in [[Geneva]] until its dissolution as a result of World War II and replacement by the United Nations. The high hopes widely held for the League in the 1920s, for example amongst members of the [[League of Nations Union]], gave way to widespread disillusion in the 1930s as the League struggled to respond to challenges from Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Japan.

One of the most important scholars of the League of Nations was Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]]. Like many of the other British enthusiasts for the League, such as [[Gilbert Murray]] and [[Florence Stawell]] - the so-called "Greece and peace" set - he came to this from the study of the [[classics]].

The creation of the League of Nations, and the hope for informed public opinion on international issues (expressed for example by the [[Union for Democratic Control]] during World War I), also saw the creation after World War I of bodies dedicated to understanding international affairs, such as the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York and the [[Royal Institute of International Affairs]] at [[Chatham House]] in London. At the same time, the academic study of international relations started to professionalize, with the creation of the first professorship of international politics, named for Woodrow Wilson, at [[Aberystwyth]], Wales, in 1919.

====Olympic Games====
The late 19th century idealist advocacy of peace which led to the creation of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], and ultimately the [[League of Nations]], also saw the re-emergence of the ancient Olympic ideal. Led by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], this culminated in the holding in 1896 of the first of the modern [[Olympic Games]].

====Nobel Peace Prize====
{{Main|Nobel Peace Prize}}
[[File:Jean Henri Dunant.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Dunant]] was awarded the first-ever Nobel Peace Prize for his role in founding the [[International Red Cross]].]]
The highest honour awarded to peace maker is the [[Nobel Prize in Peace]], awarded since 1901 by the [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]]. It is awarded annually to internationally notable persons following the prize's creation in the will of [[Alfred Nobel]]. According to Nobel's will, the Peace Prize shall be awarded to the person who "...shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/short_testamente.html |accessdate=2008-03-31 |title=Excerpt from the Will of Alfred Nobel |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026033111/http://nobelprize.org/alfred_nobel/will/short_testamente.html |archivedate=26 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rhodes Scholarships and other fellowships====
In creating the [[Rhodes Scholarships]] for outstanding students from the United States, Germany and much of the British Empire, [[Cecil Rhodes]] wrote in 1901 that 'the object is that an understanding between the three great powers will render war impossible and educational relations make the strongest tie'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.rhodes.gethifi.com/Ottawa_September_2011_To_render_war_impossible.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609195112/http://files.rhodes.gethifi.com/Ottawa_September_2011_To_render_war_impossible.pdf |archivedate=9 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This peace purpose of the Rhodes Scholarships was very prominent in the first half of the 20th century, and became prominent again in recent years under Warden of the Rhodes House [[Donald Markwell]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/news/cecil-rhodess-vision-of-peace-highlighted Cecil Rhodes's goal of Scholarships promoting peace highlighted - The Rhodes Scholarships] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922131706/http://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/news/cecil-rhodess-vision-of-peace-highlighted |date=22 September 2013 }}.

==Theories==
{{see also|Peace and conflict studies#Conceptions of peace}}
Many different theories of "peace" exist in the world of [[peace studies]], which involves the study of de-escalation, conflict transformation, disarmament, and cessation of violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.einaudi.cornell.edu/peaceprogram/ einaudi.cornell.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022225012/http://einaudi.cornell.edu/PeaceProgram/ |date=22 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "peace" can vary with religion, culture, or subject of study.

One definition is that peace is a state of balance and understanding in yourself and between others, where respect is gained by the acceptance of differences, tolerance persists, conflicts are resolved through dialog, people's rights are respected and their voices are heard, and everyone is at their highest point of serenity without social tension.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

=== Game theory ===
{{Main|Peace war game}}

The ''Peace &amp; War Game'' is an approach in [[game theory]] to understand the relationship between peace and conflicts.

The [[iterated game]] hypotheses was originally used by academic groups and [[computer simulation]]s to study possible strategies of [[cooperation]] and [[aggression]].&lt;ref&gt;Shy, O., 1996, ''[[industrial organization|Industrial Organization]]: Theory and Applications'', Cambridge, Mass.: The [[MIT]] Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

As peace makers became richer over time, it became clear that making war had greater costs than initially anticipated. One of the well studied [[strategy|strategies]] that acquired wealth more rapidly was based on [[Genghis Khan]], i.e. a constant aggressor making war continually to gain resources. This led, in contrast, to the development of what's known as the "provokable nice guy [[strategy]]", a peace-maker until attacked, improved upon merely to win by occasional forgiveness even when attacked.

There exists a strategy of multiple players who can continue to gain wealth cooperating with each other while bleeding a constantly aggressive player. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Balance of power theories===
{{Main|Balance of power (international relations)}}
The classical "realist" position is that the key to promoting order between states, and so of increasing the chances of peace, is the maintenance of a [[Balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] between states - a situation where no state is so dominant that it can "lay down the law to the rest". Exponents of this view have included [[Metternich]], [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], [[Hans Morgenthau]], and [[Henry Kissinger]]. A related approach - more in the tradition of [[Hugo Grotius]] than [[Thomas Hobbes]] - was articulated by the so-called "[[English school of international relations theory]]" such as [[Martin Wight]] in his book ''Power Politics'' (1946, 1978) and [[Hedley Bull]] in ''The Anarchical Society'' (1977).

As the maintenance of a balance of power could in some circumstances require a willingness to go to war, some critics saw the idea of a balance of power as promoting war rather than promoting peace. This was a radical critique of those supporters of the Allied and Associated Powers who justified entry into World War I on the grounds that it was necessary to preserve the balance of power in Europe from a German bid for [[hegemony]].

In the second half of the 20th century, and especially during the [[cold war]],  a particular form of balance of power - mutual nuclear deterrence - emerged as a widely held doctrine on the key to peace between the great powers. Critics argued that the development of nuclear stockpiles increased the chances of war rather than peace, and that the "nuclear umbrella" made it "safe" for smaller wars (e.g. the [[Vietnam war]] and the Soviet invasion of [[Czechoslovakia]] to end the [[Prague Spring]]), so making such wars more likely.

===Democratic peace theory===
{{Main|Democratic peace theory}}
The democratic peace theory holds that democracies will never go to war with one another.

===Free trade, interdependence and globalization===
It was a central tenet of [[classical liberalism]], for example among English liberal thinkers of the late 19th and early 20th century, that free trade promoted peace. For example, the Cambridge economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883-1946) said that he was "brought up" on this idea and held it unquestioned until at least the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from [[Donald Markwell]], ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[economic globalization]] in the decades leading up to World War I, writers such as [[Norman Angell]] argued that the growth 
of economic interdependence between the great powers made war between them futile and therefore unlikely. He made this argument in 1914.

These ideas have again come to prominence among liberal internationalists during the globalization of the late 20th and early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;For sources, see articles on [[liberalism]] and [[classical liberalism]].&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have seen [[capitalism]] as consistent with, even conducive to, peace.

===Socialism and managed capitalism===
Socialist, communist, and left-wing liberal writers of the 19th and 20th centuries (e.g., [[Lenin]], [[J.A. Hobson]], [[John Strachey (politician)|John Strachey]]) argued that capitalism caused war (e.g. through promoting imperial or other economic rivalries that lead to international conflict). This led some to argue that international socialism was the key to peace.

However, in response to such writers in the 1930s who argued that capitalism caused war, the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883-1946) argued that managed capitalism could promote peace. This involved international coordination of fiscal/monetary policies, an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against each other, and a high degree of freedom of trade. These ideas underlay Keynes's work during World War II that led to the creation of the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Bank]] at [[Breton Woods, New Jersey|Bretton Woods]] in 1944, and later of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (subsequently the [[World Trade Organization]]).&lt;ref&gt;. See [[Donald Markwell]]. ''[[John Maynard Keynes]] and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of 'active peace'===
Borrowing from the teachings of Norwegian theorist [[Johan Galtung]], one of the pioneers of the field of [[Peace and conflict studies|Peace Research]], on 'Positive Peace',&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, J: ''Peace by peaceful means: peace and conflict, development and civilization'', page 32. Sage Publications, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; and on the writings of Maine Quaker [[Gray Cox]], a consortium of theorists, activists, and practitioners in the experimental [[John Woolman College]] initiative have arrived at a theory of "active peace". This theory posits in part that peace is part of a triad, which also includes justice and wholeness (or well-being), an interpretation consonant with scriptural scholarly interpretations of the meaning of the early Hebrew word ''shalom''.  Furthermore, the consortium have integrated Galtung's teaching of the meanings of the terms peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding, to also fit into a triadic and interdependent formulation or structure. Vermont Quaker John V. Wilmerding posits five stages of growth applicable to individuals, communities, and societies, whereby one transcends first the 'surface' awareness that most people have of these kinds of issues, emerging successively into acquiescence, pacifism, passive resistance, active resistance, and finally into ''active peace'', dedicating themselves to peacemaking, peacekeeping or peace building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Wilmerding | first = John | title = The Theory of Active Peace | url = http://internationalpeaceandconflict.ning.com/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace | accessdate = 7 February 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090620023950/http://internationalpeaceandconflict.ning.com/forum/topics/the-theory-of-active-peace | archivedate = 20 June 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International organization and law===
One of the most influential theories of peace, especially since [[Woodrow Wilson]] led the creation of the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919, is that peace will be advanced if the intentional anarchy of states is replaced through the growth of [[international law]] promoted and enforced through international organizations such as the League of Nations, the [[United Nations]], and other functional international organizations. One of the most important early exponents of this view was Sir [[Alfred Zimmern]], for example in his 1936 book ''The League of Nations and the Rule of Law''.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, 1936.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trans-national solidarity===
Many "idealist" thinkers about international relations - e.g. in the traditions of [[Kant]] and [[Karl Marx]] - have argued that the key to peace is the growth of some form of solidarity between peoples (or classes of people) spanning the lines of cleavage between nations or states that lead to war.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Sir [[Harry Hinsley]]. ''Power and the Pursuit of Peace'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

One version of this is the idea of promoting international understanding between nations through the international mobility of students - an idea most powerfully advanced by [[Cecil Rhodes]] in the creation of the [[Rhodes Scholarships]], and his successors such as [[J. William Fulbright]].&lt;ref&gt;Discussed above. See, e.g., [[Donald Markwell]]. ''"Instincts to Lead": On Leadership, Peace, and Education'' (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory is that peace can be developed among countries on the basis of active management of water resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strategicforesight.com/publications.php#.WBm94-V94dU|title=Publications - Strategic Foresight Group, Think Tank, Global Policy, Global affairs research, Water Conflict studies, global policy strategies, strategic policy group, global future studies|website=strategicforesight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lyotard post-modernism===
Following [[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]], Wolfgang Sützl&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]/Wolfgang Sützl: A Call for Many Peaces; in: Dietrich, Wolfgang, Josefina Echavarría Alvarez, Norbert Koppensteiner eds.: Key Texts of Peace Studies; LIT Münster, Vienna, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Innsbruck School of Peace Studies]], some peace thinkers have abandoned any single and all-encompassing definition of peace. Rather, they promote the idea of ''many peaces''. They argue that since no singular, correct definition of peace can exist, peace should be perceived as a plurality. This post-modern understanding of peace(s) was based on the philosophy of [[Jean Francois Lyotard]]. It served as a fundament for the more recent concept of trans-rational peace(s) and elicitive conflict transformation.

In 2008 Dietrich enlarged his approach of the ''many peaces'' to the so-called ''five families'' of peace interpretations: the energetic, moral, modern, post-modern and trans-rational approach.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]]: Interpretations of Peace in History and Culture; Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Trans-rationality unites the rational and mechanistic understanding of modern peace in a relational and culture-based manner with spiritual narratives and energetic interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wolfgang Dietrich (political scientist)|Wolfgang Dietrich]], Josefina Echavarría Alvarez, Gustavo Esteva, Daniela Ingruber, Norbert Koppensteiner eds.: The Palgrave International Handbook of Peace Studies. A Cultural Approach; Palgrave MacMillan London, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The systemic understanding of trans-rational peaces advocates a client-centred method of conflict transformation, the so-called elicitive approach.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Paul Lederach]]: Preparing for Peace; Syracuse University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calendar day===
*[[Peace day]] was founded as a day of peace, to recognize and honor and promote peace. Peace Day is commemorated each year at the United Nations, and by every organization that is associated with the United Nations.

==Peace and conflict studies==
[[File:Peace-and-Prosperity-Vedder-Highsmith-detail-1.jpeg|thumb|250px|Detail from ''Peace and Prosperity'' (1896), [[Elihu Vedder]], Library of Congress [[Thomas Jefferson Building]], Washington, D.C.]]
{{Main|Peace and conflict studies}}
''Peace and conflict studies'' is an [[academic field]] which identifies and analyses [[Violence|violent]] and [[Nonviolence|nonviolent]] behaviours, as well as the structural mechanisms attending violent and non violent [[social conflict]]s.  This is to better understand the processes leading to a more desirable [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;Dugan, 1989: 74&lt;/ref&gt; One variation,
''Peace studies'' ([[irenology]]), is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] effort aiming at the prevention, [[de-escalation]], and solution of conflicts. This contrasts with [[war studies]] (polemology), directed at the efficient attainment of victory in conflicts. Disciplines involved may include [[political science]], [[geography]], [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[international relations]], [[history]], [[anthropology]], [[religious studies]], and [[gender studies]], as well as a variety of other disciplines.

==Measurement and ranking==

Although peace is widely perceived as something intangible, various organizations have been making efforts to quantify and measure it. [[Global Peace Index|The Global Peace Index]] produced by [[Institute for Economics and Peace|the Institute for Economics and Peace]] is a known effort to evaluate peacefulness in countries based on 23 indicators of the absence of violence and absence of the fear of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/our-gpi-findings|title=Vision of Humanity|work=visionofhumanity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last edition of the Index ranks 163 countries on their internal and external levels of peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/25/world/global-peace-index-iceland-syria/|title=Study: Iceland is the most peaceful nation in the world - CNN.com|author=Jethro Mullen, CNN|date=25 June 2015|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2017 [[Global Peace Index]], Iceland is the most peaceful country in the world while Syria is the least peaceful one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/06/these-are-the-most-peaceful-countries-in-the-world/|title=These are the most peaceful countries in the world|website=World Economic Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fragile States Index]] (formerly known as the Failed States Index) created by the [[Fund for Peace]] focuses on risk for instability or violence in 178 nations. This index measures how fragile a state is by 12 indicators and subindicators that evaluate aspects of politics, social economy, and military facets in countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/fragile-states-2014/|title=Fragile States 2014 - Foreign Policy|work=foreignpolicy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 Failed State Index reports that the most fragile nation is South Sudan, and the least fragile one is Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/south-sudan-fragile-states-index-hunger-idps/2827703.html|title=South Sudan Tops List of World's Fragile States - Again|work=VOA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] publishes the Peace and Conflict Instability Ledger in order to measure peace. It grades 163 countries with 5 indicators, and pays the most attention to risk of political instability or armed conflict over a three-year period. The most recent ledger shows that the most peaceful country is Slovenia on the contrary Afghanistan is the most conflicted nation. Besides indicated above reports from the [[Institute for Economics and Peace]], Fund for Peace, and University of Maryland, other organizations including George Mason University release indexes that rank countries in terms of peacefulness.

A '''psychological punishment''' is a type of [[punishment]] that relies not or only in secondary order on the actual harm inflicted (such as [[corporal punishment]]s or fines) but on psychological effects, mainly emotions, such as fear, shame and guilt. This can occasionally cause severe cardiac harm, even death, but those are not strictly intended, and in the case of torture accidental death would even defeat the purpose.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Psychological punishments that are particularly cruel or severe may be considered [[psychological torture]].

Very common is the use of shame through private or, especially, [[public humiliation]].

For example, publicly shaving a woman’s head may not only humiliate her in front of those who witness her shearing, it may also deprive her of her hair for as long as it takes to grow back, thus serving as a continual reminder of her punishment and her humiliation.

'''''R v Secretary of State for Home Affairs ex parte O'Brien''''' [1923] 2 KB 361 was a 1923 [[test case (law)|test case]] in [[English law]] that sought to have the internment and deportation of Irish nationalist sympathisers earlier that year declared legally invalid. In March 1923 between 80 and 100 suspected Irish nationalists in Britain were arrested by the police and sent to the [[Irish Free State]] under the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920]] (ROIA). One of the detainees, [[Art O'Brien]], challenged his detention in a test case at the [[Divisional Court]]. The case eventually went to both the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], who decided that the internments were illegal because the Irish Free State was an independent nation and so British Acts of Parliament no longer applied to it.

The decision effectively illegalised the ROIA and led to the immediate release of O'Brien and the other detained individuals, who sued the British Government for false imprisonment. The government pushed through the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923]], which limited the money they had to pay the detainees, who eventually received £43,000. O'Brien himself was re-arrested and found guilty of [[sedition]], and was imprisoned until 1924.

==Background==
Following the [[Irish War of Independence]] the [[Irish Free State]] was set up as an independent British [[Dominion]] covering most of the [[Ireland|island of Ireland]]. After a brief [[Irish Civil War|civil war]] between the pro-Free State forces and members of the [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island the status of the Irish Free State was confirmed, and the IRA forced underground.&lt;ref name="h36"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.123&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the [[Irish Self-Determination League]] (ISDL), and the Free State government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a close eye on them.&lt;ref name="h36"/&gt; Between February and March they provided information on individuals that they said were part of widespread plots against the Irish Free State being prepared on British soil.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (1924) p.273&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O'Brien, the head of the ISDL.&lt;ref name="h37"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.124&lt;/ref&gt; Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eighty&lt;ref name=am1&gt;Amato (2002) p.32&lt;/ref&gt; or approximately 100.&lt;ref name="h37"/&gt; The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a [[Royal Navy]] destroyer.&lt;ref name=am1/&gt; It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O'Brien himself had been born in England),&lt;ref name=chand1&gt;Chandler (1924) p.274&lt;/ref&gt; at least six had never even been to Ireland before.&lt;ref name="h37"/&gt;

The next day the arrests were publicly queried in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and a Labour backbencher [[Jack Jones (Silvertown MP)|Jack Jones]] started a debate on the subject in the afternoon. [[William Bridgeman, 1st Viscount Bridgeman|W.C. Bridgeman]], the [[Home Secretary]], said that he had directly ordered the police to arrest the ISDL members under the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920]], and that he had consulted the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] who considered it legal.&lt;ref name="h37"/&gt;

==Divisional Court==
A few days after the arrests the solicitors for one of the deported men, Art O'Brien, got in contact with [[Patrick Hastings|Sir Patrick Hastings]] [[King's Counsel|KC]], a [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and a noted [[barrister]].&lt;ref name="h38"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.126&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 March 1923 Hastings represented O'Brien in front of a [[Divisional Court]] consisting of [[Horace Avory|Mr Justice Avory]] and [[Arthur Salter (judge)|Mr Justice Salter]] to apply for a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' for O'Brien as a test case to allow the release of the others. The initial hearing did not go anywhere because Hastings was unable to provide an affidavit from O'Brien (who was in [[Mountjoy Prison]]),&lt;ref name=chand1/&gt; which was required for a writ of ''habeas corpus'' to be considered, but by the time the hearing was resumed on 10 April he had managed to obtain one.&lt;ref name="h38"/&gt; Hastings argued that because the Irish Free State was an independent nation the British laws governing it, such as the 1920 act, were effectively repealed.&lt;ref name="h39"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.127&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the [[Home Secretary]] had no power to order an individual to be detained overseas because he had no control over what happened to them there.&lt;ref name="h39"/&gt;

The court eventually declared that they could not issue a writ, because the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1862]] prevented them from issuing a writ to any colony possessing a court which could also issue a writ. Since Ireland possessed such a court, the English Divisional Court could not act.&lt;ref name="h39"/&gt; Hastings attempted to argue that the writ could be issued against the Home Secretary but this also failed, since the Home Secretary did not actually possess O'Brien.&lt;ref name="h40"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court of Appeal and House of Lords==
The decision was then appealed to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] and argued on 23 and 24 April.&lt;ref name="h40"/&gt; The Court of Appeal reversed the [[Divisional Court]]'s decision.&lt;ref&gt;Bonner (2007) p.80&lt;/ref&gt; The court decided that the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland Act 1920]] had been implicitly repealed when the [[Irish Free State]], an independent nation, came into existence. In addition it was not proper for the Home Secretary to order the detention and deportation of someone overseas, since they had no control over what happened to them.&lt;ref name=img1&gt;Amato (2002) p.33&lt;/ref&gt; It was completely appropriate to issue a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' against the Home Secretary because, even though he did not physically have O'Brien, he was considered responsible for him.&lt;ref name="h40"/&gt; The Home Secretary was accordingly ordered to produce O'Brien before the court on 16 May.&lt;ref name="h41"&gt;Hyde (1960) p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

He appealed to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], who decided (led by [[F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead|Lord Birkenhead]]) that they did not have the jurisdiction to hear the appeal,&lt;ref name="h41"/&gt; since a rule of English law specifies that once a writ of ''habeas corpus'' is issued (as it was by the Court of Appeal) no superior court can overrule it.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler (1924) p.276&lt;/ref&gt; After a further attempt to keep O'Brien in custody (simply by not letting him out of prison)&lt;ref name=am1/&gt; he was finally released on 16 May.&lt;ref name="h41"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
O'Brien immediately sued the British Government for false imprisonment, and to avoid any liability the government prepared the [[Restoration of Order in Ireland (Indemnity) Act 1923]] which would indemnify them against any claims for damages by the imprisoned sympathisers.&lt;ref name=img1/&gt; The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] whittled it down when it was being prepared so that it would only limit compensation rather than remove it entirely.&lt;ref name="h41"/&gt; A tribunal was set up under [[James Atkin, Baron Atkin|Lord Atkin]] to assess damages, and the sympathisers as a whole were eventually paid £43,000.&lt;ref name=img1/&gt; Art O'Brien himself was arrested soon after release and convicted of [[sedition]].&lt;ref&gt;Bonner (2007) p.81&lt;/ref&gt; He was released in 1924.&lt;ref name=img1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8225">'''''Religio licita''''' ("permitted religion,"&lt;ref&gt;''Licita'' is the [[past participle]] of ''licet'', "is permitted, is lawful."&lt;/ref&gt; also translated as "approved religion"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jörg Rüpke]], ''Religion of the Romans'' (Polity Press, 2007, originally published in German 2001), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a phrase used in the ''[[Apologeticus|Apologeticum]]'' of [[Tertullian]]&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''Apologeticum'' 21.1.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the special status of the [[Jews in the Roman Empire]]. It was not an official term in [[Roman law]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Francis Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts: The Social and Political Motivations of Lucan Theology'' (Cambridge University Press, 1989, 1996), p. 211, begins his analysis of the ''religio licita'' theory "by immediately scotching the idea that Rome had some process for licensing foreign religions. There is no historical support for this whatsoever; … there never was a juridical category of ''religio licita''." See also Rüpke, ''Religion of the Romans'', p. 35; Solomon Grayzel, "The Jews and Roman Law," ''Jewish Quarterly Review'', 59 (1968), pp. 93-117; [[Ben Witherington III]], ''The Acts of the Apostles: A Socio-rhetorical Commentary ''(Grand Rapids, Michigan: Eerdmans, 1997), p. 542; John J. O'Keefe, entry on "Religio licita," in ''A Dictionary of Jewish-Christian Relations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005), p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it occurs in only one [[Church Fathers|patristic text]] and in no [[classical antiquity|classical]] Roman sources or inscriptions,&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin H. Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'' (Princeton University Press, 2004, 2006), p. 449; Tessa Rajak, "Was There a Roman Charter for the Jews?" ''Journal of Roman Studies'', 74 (1984), pp. 107-123. As Stephen Wilson, ''Related Strangers: Jews and Christians, 70–170 C.E.'' (Augsburg Fortress, 1995, 2005), p. 68, has noted, ''religio licita'' "is not a Roman but a Christian concept."&lt;/ref&gt; the phrase has spawned abundant scholarly conjecture on its possible significance. Some scholars have gone so far as to imagine that all religions under the Empire had a legal status as either ''licita'' or ''illicita'', despite the absence of any ancient texts referring to these categories.&lt;ref&gt;Philip A. Harland, ''Associations, Synagogues, and Congregations: Claiming a Place in Ancient Mediterranean Society'' (Augsburg Fortress, 2003), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; The most extreme view has held that Tertullian's phrase means all foreign religions required a license from the Roman government.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 206, taking note of Foakes Jackson and Kirsopp Lake, B.S. Easton, and the early work of H.J. Cadbury as examples of this extreme of interpretation.&lt;/ref&gt; But it was Roman custom to permit or even encourage the subject peoples of the [[Roman province|provinces]] and foreign communities in Rome to maintain their ancestral religion, unless specific practices were regarded as disruptive or subversive:&lt;ref&gt;Isaac, ''The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity'', p. 449; Jörg Rüpke, "Roman Religion – Religions of Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; "A ''religio'' was ''licita'' for a particular group on the basis of tribe or nationality and traditional practices, coupled with the proviso that its rites were not offensive to the Roman people or [[List of Roman deities|its gods]]."&lt;ref&gt;W. H. C. Frend, ''Martyrdom and Persecution in the Early Church: A Study of Conflict from the Maccabees to Donatus'' (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1967), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tertullian uses the phrase in a passage arguing that Christians should be granted the same [[freedom of religion|freedom to practice their religion]] as any other inhabitant of the Empire; the passage itself, and not the phrase ''religio licita'', is evidence of the general [[religious tolerance|tolerance]] afforded under [[Religion in ancient Rome|the Roman system of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Cecilia Ames, "Roman Religion in the Vision of Tertullian," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism as ''licita''==
''Religio licita'' has sometimes been taken as a formal recognition or [[charter]] originating with [[Julius Caesar]] and embodied by various pieces of Roman legislation pertaining to the Jews, conceived of as a coherent policy.&lt;ref&gt;E. Mary Smallwood, ''The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian: A Study in Political Relations'' (2nd ed.; Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1981), p. 539 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the various privileges and exemptions granted to the Jews were responses to specific complaints or requests, made in the context of the traditional [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patronage network]],&lt;ref&gt;Harland, ''Associations, Synagogues, and Congregations'', pp. 221–222; Leonard Victor Rutgers, "Roman Policy towards the Jews: Expulsions from the City of Rome during the First Century C.E.," ''Classical Antiquity'', 13 (1994) pp. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; and had nothing to do with a supposed ''religio licita'' status.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that the Romans respected Judaism, it was because of the religion's great antiquity, ancestral tradition being regarded as a source of social and political stability.&lt;ref&gt;Esler, ''Community and Gospel in Luke–Acts'', p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been observed that "[[Roman magistrates]] treated the Jews the way they did not because they were consciously tolerant, but simply because they had no reason to hinder the free exercise of Jewish religious practices."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Victor Rutgers, "Roman Policy towards the Jews: Expulsions from the City of Rome during the First Century C.E.," ''Classical Antiquity'' 13 (1994), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christianity as ''illicita''==
Some scholars have argued that Christianity was declared a ''religio illicita'' (an impermissible or illegitimate religion) by [[Domitian]] in the [[80s]] AD.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey E.M. de Ste. Croix, "Why Were the Early Christians Persecuted?" ''Past and Present'', 26 (1963), pp. 6-38.&lt;/ref&gt; Though this term appears nowhere, it has been conjectured that a declaration of Christianity as ''illicita'' was the legal basis for official persecutions. There was, however, "no law, either existing section of criminal law, or special legislation directed against the Christians, under which Christians were prosecuted in the first two centuries."&lt;ref&gt;J.E.A. Crake, "Early Christians and Roman Law," ''Phoenix'' 19 (1965), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Rome lacked a uniform policy or legal code pertaining to foreign cults,&lt;ref&gt;T.D. Barnes, "Legislation against the Christians," ''Journal of Roman Studies'' 58 (1968), 50&lt;/ref&gt; and before Christian hegemony in the 4th century, there was no legal language to designate a concept analogous to "[[heresy]]" or crimes against orthodox religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rutgers, "Roman Policy," p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Constantine the Great]], [[Early Christianity|Christianity]] and other religions became tolerated with the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313. Toleration did not extend to religions that practiced [[human sacrifice]], such as [[Druidism]]. This state of affairs lasted until 380, when [[Nicene Creed|Nicene Christianity]] was adopted as the [[State church of the Roman Empire|state religion of the Roman Empire]], after which time [[Historical_persecution_by_Christians#Roman_Empire|persecution]] of non-Christian and non-Nicene cults began. [[Priscillian]] was executed for heresy in 385, and [[Theodosius I]] began outlawing Rome's traditional religious rituals in 391.

In the [[social science]]s, '''social structure''' is the patterned social arrangements in [[society]] that are both [[emergence|emergent]] from and determinant of the [[Structure and agency|actions of the individuals]]. On the [[Macrosociology|macro]] scale, social structure is the system of socioeconomic [[social stratification|stratification]] (e.g., the class structure), [[social institutions]], or, other patterned relations between large social groups. On the meso scale, it is the structure of [[social network]] ties between individuals or organizations. On the micro scale, it can be the way [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] shape the behavior of individuals within the [[social system]].

[[Norm (social)|Social norms]] influence social structure through relations between the majority and the minority.  Because those who align with the majority are considered [[normality (behavior)|normal]] while those who align with the minority are considered [[Abnormality (behavior)|abnormal]], majority-minority relations create a [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] stratification within social structures that favors the majority in all aspects of society.

These scales are not always kept separate. For example, recent scholarship by [[John Levi Martin]] has theorized that certain macro-scale structures are the [[emergent properties]] of micro-scale cultural institutions (this meaning of "structure" resembles that used by anthropologist [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]). Likewise, another recent study, in ethnography, describes how indigenous social structure in the Republic of Panama changed macro social structures and impeded a planned Panama Canal expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller-Schwarze|first1=Nina K.|title=The Blood of Victoriano Lorenzo: An Ethnography of the Cholos of Northern Coclé Province.|date=2015|publisher=McFarland Press|location=Jefferson, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marxist sociology]] also has a history of mixing different meanings of social structure, though it has done so by simply treating the cultural aspects of social structure as [[epiphenomena]] of its economic ones.

Since the 1920s, the term has been in general use in social science,&lt;ref&gt;Merton, Robert. 1938. ''Social Structure and Anomie''. American Sociological Review, Vol. 3, No.5, pp.672-682&lt;/ref&gt; especially as a variable whose sub-components needed to be distinguished in relationship to other sociological variables.

==Overview==
The notion of social structure ''as relationship between different entities or groups'' or as ''enduring and relatively stable patterns of relationship''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Olanike|first=Deji|title=Gender and Rural Development  By|pages=71|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Friw38mN7-kC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=as+relationships+between+different+entities+or+groups+or+as+enduring+and+relatively+stable+patterns+of+relationship+emphasises#v=onepage&amp;q=as%20relationships%20between%20different%20entities%20or%20groups%20or%20as%20enduring%20and%20relatively%20stable%20patterns%20of%20relationship%20emphasises&amp;f=false|isbn=9783643901033|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasises the idea that society is grouped into structurally related groups or sets of [[role]]s, with different functions, meanings or purposes. One example of social structure is the idea of "[[social stratification]]", which refers to the idea that most societies are separated into different strata (levels), guided (if only partially) by the underlying structures in the social system. This approach has been important in the academic literature with the rise of various forms of [[structuralism]]. It is important in the modern study of organizations, because an organization's structure may determine its flexibility, capacity to change, and many other factors. Therefore, structure is an important issue for [[management]].

Social structure may be seen to influence important social systems including the [[economic system]], [[legal system]], [[political system]], [[cultural system]], and others. [[Family]], [[religion]], [[law]], [[economy]], and [[Social class|class]] are all social structures. The "social system" is the parent system of those various systems that are embedded in it.

==History==
The early study of social structures has informed the study of institutions, culture and agency, social interaction, and history. [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] was apparently the first to use the term social structure; later, [[Karl Marx]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Max Weber]], [[Ferdinand Tönnies]], and [[Émile Durkheim]] all contributed to structural concepts in sociology. Weber investigated and analyzed the institutions of modern society: [[Market (economics)|market]], [[bureaucracy]] (private enterprise and public administration), and politics (e.g. democracy).

One of the earliest and most comprehensive accounts of social structure was provided by Karl Marx, who related political, cultural, and religious life to the [[mode of production]] (an underlying economic structure). Marx argued that the economic [[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|base]] substantially determined the cultural and political [[Base and superstructure (Marxism)|superstructure]] of a society. Subsequent Marxist accounts, such as that by [[Louis Althusser]], proposed a more complex relationship that asserted the relative autonomy of cultural and political institutions, and a general determination by economic factors only "in the last instance".&lt;ref name=Calhoun&gt;Dictionary of the Social Science, "''Social Structure''" article&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the German sociologist [[Ferdinand Tönnies]] first published his study ''The Present Problems of Social Structure'' in the U.S.A,&lt;ref&gt;''The [[American Journal of Sociology]]'', vol. 10, 1905, no. 5, p. 569-688&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that only the ''constitution'' of a multitude into a unity creates a "social structure" (basing this approach on his concept of [[will (sociology)|social will]]).

[[Émile Durkheim]] (drawing on the analogies between biological and social systems popularized by [[Herbert Spencer]] and others) introduced the idea that diverse social institutions and practices played a role in assuring the functional integration of society through assimilation of diverse parts into a unified and self-reproducing whole. In this context, Durkheim distinguished two forms of structural relationship: [[mechanical solidarity]] and [[organic solidarity]]. The former describes structures that unite similar parts through a shared culture; the latter describes differentiated parts united through social exchange and material interdependence.&lt;ref name=Calhoun/&gt;

As did Marx and Weber, more generally, [[Georg Simmel]] developed a wide-ranging approach that provided observations and insights into domination and subordination,  competition, division of labor, formation of parties, representation, inner solidarity coupled with exclusiveness toward the outside, and many similar features in the state, in a religious community, in an economic association, in an art school, and in family and kinship networks (however diverse the interests that give rise to these associations, the forms in which interests are realized may yet be identical (Crothers, 1996)).

The notion of social structure was extensively developed in the 20th century, with key contributions from [[structuralism|structuralist]] perspectives drawing on the theories of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], Feminist or Marxist perspectives, from [[structural functionalism|functionalist]] perspectives such as those developed by [[Talcott Parsons]] and his followers, or from a variety of analytic perspectives (see Blau 1975, Lopez and Scott 2000). Some follow Marx in trying to identify the basic dimensions of society that explain the other dimensions, most emphasizing either economic production or political power. Others follow Lévi-Strauss in seeking logical order in cultural structures. Still others, notably [[Peter Blau]], follow Simmel in attempting to base a formal theory of social structure on numerical patterns in relationships—analyzing, for example, the ways in which factors like [[Group size measures|group size]] shape intergroup relations.&lt;ref name=Calhoun/&gt;

The notion of social structure is intimately related to a variety of central topics in social science, including the relation of [[structure and agency]]. The most influential attempts to combine the concept of social structure with agency are [[Anthony Giddens]]' [[theory of structuration]] and [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s [[practice theory]]. Giddens emphasizes the duality of structure and agency, in the sense that structures and agency cannot be conceived apart from one another. This permits him to argue that structures are neither independent of actors nor determining of their behavior, but rather sets of rules and competencies on which actors draw, and which, in the aggregate, they reproduce. Giddens's analysis, in this respect, closely parallels [[Jacques Derrida]]'s deconstruction of the binaries that underlie classic sociological and anthropological reasoning (notably the universalizing tendencies of Lévi-Strauss's structuralism). Bourdieu's practice theory also seeks a more supple account of social structure as embedded in, rather than determinative of, individual behavior.&lt;ref name=Calhoun/&gt;

Other recent work by [[Margaret Archer]] (morphogenesis theory), [[Tom R. Burns]] and collaborators ([[actor-system dynamics theory]] and [[social rule system theory]]), and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]] ([[World Systems Theory]]) provided elaborations and applications of the sociological classics in structural sociology.

==Definitions and concepts==
As noted above, social structure has been identified as
* the relationship of definite entities or groups to each other,
* enduring patterns of behaviour by participants in a social system in relation to each other, and
* institutionalised norms or cognitive frameworks that structure the actions of actors in the social system.

Lopez and Scott (2000) distinguish between ''institutional structure'' and ''relational structure'', where in the former:

{{cquote|''...social structure is seen as comprising those cultural or normative patterns that define the expectations of agents hold about each other's behaviour and that organize their enduring relations with each other.'' (p. 3)}}

whereas in the latter:

{{cquote|''...social structure is seen as comprising the relationships themselves, understood as patterns of causal interconnection and interdependence among agents and their actions, as well as the positions that they occupy.'' (p. 3)}}

Social structure can also be divided into [[Microsociology|microstructure]] and [[Macrosociology|macrostructure]]. Microstructure is the pattern of relations between most basic elements of social life, that cannot be further divided and have no social structure of their own (for example, pattern of relations between individuals in a group composed of individuals - where individuals have no social structure, or a structure of organizations as a pattern of relations between [[social position]]s or [[social role]]s, where those positions and roles have no structure by themselves). Macrostructure is thus a kind of 'second level' structure, a pattern of relations between objects that have their own structure (for example, a political social structure between political parties, as political parties have their own social structure). Some types of social structures that modern sociologist differentiate are ''relation structures'' (in family or larger family-like clan structures), ''communication structures'' (how information is passed in organizations) and ''[[sociometry|sociometric structures]]'' (structures of sympathy, antipathy and indifference in organisations - this was studied by [[Jacob L. Moreno]]).

[[Social rule system theory]] reduces the structures of (3) to particular rule system arrangements, that is, the types of basic structures of (1 and 2). It shares with [[role theory]], [[organizational sociology|organizational]] and [[institutional sociology]], and [[Social network#Social network analysis|network analysis]] the concern with structural properties and developments and at the same time provides detailed conceptual tools needed to generate interesting, fruitful propositions and models and analyses.

Sociologists also distinguish between:
* normative structure – pattern of relations in given structure (organisation) between [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and modes of operations of people of varying [[social position]]s
* ideal structure – pattern of relations between beliefs and views of people of varying social positions
* interest structure – pattern of relations between goals and desires of people of varying social positions
* interaction structure – forms of communications of people of varying social positions

==Origins and development==
Some believe that social structure is naturally developed. It may be caused by larger system needs, such as the need for [[labour (economics)|labour]], [[management]], [[professional]] and [[military]] classes, or by conflicts between groups, such as competition among [[political party|political parties]] or among [[elite]]s and [[Hoi polloi|masses]]. Others believe that this structuring is not a result of natural processes, but is socially constructed. It may be created by the power of elites who seek to retain their power, or by [[economic system]]s that place emphasis upon [[competition]] or [[cooperation]].  

Ethnography has contributed to understandings about social structure by revealing local practices and customs that differ from Western practices of hierarchy and economic power in its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Müller-Schwarze|first1=Nina K.|title=The Blood of Victoriano Lorenzo: An Ethnography of the Cholos of Northern Coclé Province.|date=2015|publisher=McFarland Press|location=Jefferson, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most thorough account of the evolution of social structure is perhaps provided by [[structure and agency]] accounts that allow for a sophisticated analysis of the co-evolution of social structure and human agency, where socialised agents with a degree of autonomy take action in social systems where their action is on the one hand mediated by existing institutional structure and expectations but may, on the other hand, influence or transform that institutional structure.  

==Critical implications==
The notion of social structure may mask systematic biases, as it involves many identifiable subvariables, for example, gender. Some argue that men and women who have otherwise equal qualifications receive different treatment in the workplace because of their gender, which would be termed a "social structural" bias, but other variables (such as time on the job or hours worked) might be masked. Modern social structural analysis takes this into account through [[multivariate analysis]] and other techniques, but the analytic problem of how to combine various aspects of social life into a whole remains.&lt;ref&gt;Aberration, t AL., 2000; Jay &amp; Vary 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ottoman Empire==
The [[Armenians|Armenian]] hosiery-manufacturer and musician Samuel Hovannes Zorian was arrested in 1895 by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] authorities for being a political activist. He was beaten and incarcerated in a so-called "police room", measuring barely two feet square in size and with no windows. On the second day, he was dragged out and beaten almost senseless with sticks. Zorian was then sent back to the "police room" where he was confined for a further week and was only sustained on a diet of bread and water, with no medical attention given to him during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EIHG4mld7oMC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=%22merchants+in+exile%22+%22shaken+and+bleeding%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1EpkOH5ykm&amp;sig=uBeP1loE_7Th-gMYcgzZJ9r5Kto&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwib1rySiJzOAhXHBsAKHfqOAn0Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22merchants%20in%20exile%22%20%22shaken%20and%20bleeding%22&amp;f=false |title=Merchants in Exile: The Armenians in Manchester, England, 1835{{ndash}}1935 |page=98 |first=Joan |last=George |publisher=Taderon Press |isbn=978-1903656082 |accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oranienburg ==
[[Sturmabteilung|SA]] camp kommandant [[Werner Schäfer]] had two cells built in the basement of the [[Oranienburg concentration camp]] in 1933. The dimensions of the cell were such that a person could only stand. A prisoner surnamed Neumann was held there for 192 hours and was allegedly driven mad as a result of his confinement. At times, prisoners were held in small coffin-sized closets in which they could only stand.

== Dachau ==
The number of prisoners in [[Dachau concentration camp]] increased dramatically in the last years of the [[Second World War]]. The concentration camp was overcrowded. In late 1944, the camp command erected standing cells. The stone chambers were similar to chimneys and measured 75 x 80 cm (29.5 x 31.5 inches).&lt;ref group=note&gt; The surfaces were measured after camps had been liberated, using foundation ruins.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a small hatch on top for air, and a narrow door with an iron bar bolted to the cell. The intensified punitive measure saved room and reinforced the punitive agony. There were also standing cells at the [[Allach (concentration camp)|Allach subcamp]], where the cells were smaller than at Dachau. Some at other camps were bigger, about 90 x 90 cm (35.5 x 35.5 inches).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/glossary/en/Stehbunker Glossary entry for ''Stehbunker''] Wollheim Memorial, official website. Retrieved June 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the prisoner K. A. Gross and the [[Poland|Polish]] prisoner Max Hoffmann spent days in the standing cell. Hoffmann described it thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was a terrible state, as I thought that it was over for me, everything was so callous and distant for me. I couldn't lie down, couldn't crouch, the best was to stand, stand, six days and six nights long. [...] You touch the walls on both sides with your elbows, your back touches the wall behind you, your knees the wall in front of you. [...] This is no punishment or pre-trial detention, it is [[torture]], straight forward, Middle Ages torture. I had bloodshot eyes, numb from bad air, I was just waiting for the end.&lt;ref&gt; Karel Kasak, ''Cesi v koncentracnim tabore Dachau.'' in ''Almanch Dachau. Kytice udalosti a vzpominek'', Prague, 1946. Cited in Zámečník, ''Das war Dachau'', p. 349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Johannes Neuhäusler]], an inmate in the standing cell received a single piece of bread in three days.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Neuhäusler refers here to two clergymen, Theissig from Aachen, and Johann Lenz.&lt;/ref&gt; On the fourth day, the prisoner was removed from the standing cell, given a normal camp meal ration and allowed to sleep on a wooden cot. On the next day, the three-day confinement in the standing cell began anew.

The [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] did not always adhere to the interruption after the third day. A Czech prisoner, Radovan Drazan, spent eight days without a break in a standing cell.&lt;ref&gt;Zuzana Mosnáková, [http://www.hagalil.com/czech/dachau/dachau-4.htm "Tschechische Häftlinge im Konzentrationslager Dachau"] German Jewish website.

== Auschwitz ==
There were four standing cells at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] in the basement of [[Block 11]], which measured about one yard square, and in which four persons were crammed, able only to stand. There was only a 2" opening for air, so that prisoners wouldn't suffocate.&lt;ref name="Yahil1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Leni Yahil|title=The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e_aRvKpLUf0C&amp;pg=PA374|accessdate=30 June 2012|date=17 October 1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-504523-9|pages=373–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment in these cells was usually imposed for a period of 10 days.&lt;ref name="Yahil1991"/&gt;  Auschwitz survivor Josef Kral testified at the [[Auschwitz Trials]] about the standing cells where he had been held for six weeks with three meals during that time, and about how one prisoner was so hungry, he ate his shoes.&lt;ref name="Wittmann2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rebecca Wittmann|title=Beyond Justice: The Auschwitz Trial|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Q7JRhA9ACUC&amp;pg=PA155|accessdate=30 June 2012|year=2005|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01694-1|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyvx-Gzb6kM Audio clip of Kral testimony (excerpt) with photos and prisoner drawings] Youtube video.

The Supreme Court reversed the case for further trial after finding that expert testimony regarding the defence's submission, that Kelly suffered from [[Battered woman defence|battered woman syndrome]], was incorrectly excluded since battered woman syndrome was a proper subject for expert evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.audiocasefiles.com/cases/detail/case/8764/ ''State v.

==Background==

=== Straight pride as an appeal to ridicule ===
{{see also|White pride}}

The concept of [[LGBT pride]] originates as a movement which seeks to [[Self-affirmation#Self-affirmation at the collective level|challenge the negative images]] of LGBT people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/kameny_f,2.html|title=Kameny, Frank|website=glbtq.com}} "Kameny [...] coined the slogan 'Gay is Good'."&lt;/ref&gt; by being openly identified with a culturally [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] group; as such, it creates a discomfort.&lt;ref name="Shifting Sands"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eliason|first=Michele|author2=Schope, Robert |title=Shifting Sands or Solid Foundation? Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Identity Formation|journal=The Health of Sexual Minorities|year=2007|volume=1 |pages=3–26|doi=10.1007/97803873133441|doi-broken-date=2018-09-21}} "Not surprisingly, individuals in the pride stage are most criticized not only by heterosexual persons but also many LGBT individuals, who are uncomfortable forcing the majority to share the discomfort. Heterosexual individuals may express bewilderment at the term “gay pride,” arguing that they do not talk about “straight pride”".&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, the terms ''straight pride'' and ''heterosexual pride'' exist as an argument criticizing gay pride as unnecessary, stating by contrast with [[heterosexuality]] that heterosexuals "don't talk about straight pride",&lt;ref name="Shifting Sands"/&gt; don't have "straight pride rallies",&lt;ref name="donthaveem"/&gt; and would be seen as ridiculous if they were to "band together and have a heterosexual pride [...] parade".&lt;ref name="kainz"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DRYkYduABiQC&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22heterosexual%20pride%22%20%22straight%20pride%22&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=%22heterosexual%20pride%22%20%22straight%20pride%22&amp;f=false|author=[[Howard Kainz|Howard P. Kainz]]|title=Politically Incorrect Dialogues: Topics Not Discussed in Polite Circles|isbn=978-9042006867|year=1999}}, p.39. One of the two fictional philosophers in the dialogs states: "If, for example, heterosexuals were to band together and have a 'heterosexual pride' (or '"straight" pride') parade, it would be recognized immediately as dumb and ridiculous."&lt;/ref&gt;

This ''[[appeal to ridicule]]'' argument expresses the idea that showing pride for a homosexual orientation is equally absurd. Analysts of LGBT rights state as a counter-argument that mainstream culture offers many [[heteronormativity|approved social venues]] (weddings, baptism, family reunions...) for heterosexuals to express and celebrate their sexual orientation in public, while homosexuals usually feel isolated and [[pride parade]]s offer them support and an opportunity for socializing.&lt;ref name="donthaveem"/&gt;

=== Straight pride events ===
[[File:Man-and-woman-icon.svg|thumb|100px|right|An image often used on Straight Pride T-shirts]]
"Heterosexual pride" parades exist as a response to societal acceptance of LGBT visibility, and originated in campuses in the 1990s as a backlash tactic.&lt;ref name="Massachusetts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.massresistance.org/docs/downloads/romney/CommReport_Making_Colleges_Safe_7-93.pdf|title=Making colleges and universities safe for gay and lesbian students: Report and recommendations of the Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth|publisher=Massachusetts. Governor's Commission on Gay and Lesbian Youth}}, p.20. "A relatively recent tactic used in the backlash opposing les/bi/gay/trans campus visibility is the so-called "heterosexual pride" strategy".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ChicagoTribune1"/&gt;

Incidents where the slogan or concept of "Straight pride" caused controversy have occurred since the late 1980s. In 1988, for example, [[Vermont]] Republican John Burger asked the state's Governor to establish a "Straight Pride Day".&lt;ref name="vermont1988"/&gt;  In 1990, rallies in support of Straight Pride were held at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] (organized by the group Young Americans for Freedom) and nearby [[Mount Holyoke College]].&lt;ref name="straigh1"&gt;(6 May 1990).

*'''Yellowknife, NWT (2005)''':  In May 2005, the northern Canadian city of [[Yellowknife]] announced that it would mark both a gay and straight pride day.&lt;ref name = "Yellowknife"&gt;{{cite news | title = Yellowknife to mark gay and straight pride | work = CBCnews Canada | date = May 25, 2005 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2005/05/25/yellowknife-gaypride050525.html | accessdate = 2012-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the mayor proclaimed June 10, 2005 as Gay Pride Day, Councillor Alan Woytuik proposed that there be a Heterosexual Day.  The mayor agreed and set it for June 9.  Woytuik defended the proposal for Heterosexual Day by stating that "recognizing the contributions of heterosexuals is just as legitimate as recognizing the contributions of gay and lesbian communities."  The group seeking the Gay Pride Day designation was dismayed, asking if Black History Month would be partnered with White Heritage Month and whether days marking heart disease and strokes should be paired with days celebrating good health&lt;ref name = "Yellowknife" /&gt;  Woytuik's request for Heterosexual Day was widely reported on.  Shocked by the attention, he withdrew his request for the proclamation and apologized.  He referred to his request as a simple one seeking to treat everyone the same which was blown out of proportion.

In 2001, [[Woodbury High School (Minnesota)|Woodbury High School]] in [[Woodbury, Minnesota]], a suburb of [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]], created homophobia-free areas called "safe zones" designated by an inverted [[pink triangle]] and intended for LGBT students.&lt;ref name="Fenton"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fenton|first=Ben|title=Student wins right to show 'straight pride'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1381953/Student-wins-right-to-show-straight-pride.html|accessdate=23 March 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=18 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Student Elliot Chambers reacted by wearing a makeshift sweatshirt with the slogan "Straight Pride" and the image of male and female [[stick figure]]s holding hands.   In light of previous anti-LGBT incidents, the school's principal ordered Chambers to remove the shirt, and a court case ensued.&lt;ref name="Ayres" /&gt;  A court upheld Chambers' complaint that his [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights had been violated, and that the principal's decision was unjustified.&lt;ref name="Ayres"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ayres | first1 = Ian | last2 = Brown | first2 = Jennifer Gerarda | title = Straightforward: how to mobilize heterosexual support for gay rights (Google eBook) | publisher = Princeton University Press | year = 2005 | location = Princeton, NJ

In 2010, in response to local suicides amongst LGBT adolescents, an [[Ally Week]] was held at [[St. Charles North High School]] in [[St. Charles, Illinois]].  On the first day of this Ally Week, though, three students arrived wearing "Straight Pride" t-shirts.  The back of these t-shirts displayed "[[s:Bible (King James)/Leviticus#Chapter 20|Leviticus 20:13]]", the verse stating that those who perform homosexual acts should be put to death.  While the school did not force the students to remove their t-shirts, it did persuade them to remove the bible quotation.  The following day two different students arrived wearing "Straight Pride" t-shirts minus the Bible quotations and were consequently asked to remove their shirts.&lt;ref name="dailyherald"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fuller|first=James|title=‘Straight Pride' shirts become free speech fight at St. Charles North|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20101110/news/711119792/|accessdate=23 March 2012|newspaper=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]|date=11 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = rightseducation&gt;&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/11/12/chicago-high-school-uses-straight-pride-shirts-rights-education/  Chicago High School Uses 'Straight Pride' Shirts for Rights Education

===Balancing freedom of expression vs. protection of students===

In school environments, straight pride expressions and events have been reviewed within a framework of balancing freedom of expression with protection of other students.  In some situations, schools take actions against students who are open about or encourage hiding homosexuality, or limit clothing that has references to sexual orientation.  Such may prompt lawsuits.&lt;ref name = SchoolLegal/&gt; In the  Minnesota Chambers v.

{{for|the actual death of players in sport|Sudden cardiac death of athletes}}
In a [[sport]] or [[game]], '''sudden death''' (also '''sudden-death overtime''' or a '''sudden-death round''') is a form of competition where play ends as soon as one competitor is ahead of the others, with that competitor becoming the winner.  Sudden death is typically used as a [[tiebreaker]] when a contest is tied at the end of the normal playing time or the completion of the normal playing task.

An alternative tiebreaker method is to play a reduced version of the original; for example, in [[association football]] 30 minutes of [[extra time]] (overtime) after 90 minutes of normal time, or in [[golf]] one playoff round (18 holes) after four standard rounds (72 holes).  Sudden-death playoffs typically end more quickly than these reduced replays.  Reducing the variability of the event's duration assists those scheduling television time and team travel. Fans may see sudden death as exciting and suspenseful, or they may view the format as insufficiently related to the sport played during regulation time; for example, prior to 2012, the [[National Football League]] ([[American football]]) used a sudden-death rule for overtime play.  In those situations, a team possessing the ball need only kick a field goal to end the game in their favor, negating the additional benefit that typically comes with scoring a touchdown.

Sudden death provides a victor for the contest without a specific amount of time being required.  It may be called "'''next score wins'''" or similar, although in some games, the winner may result from penalization of the other competitor for a mistake.  Sudden death may instead be called '''sudden victory''' to avoid the mention of death and serious disease, particularly in sports with a high risk of physical injury. This variant became one of announcer [[Curt Gowdy]]'s idiosyncrasies in 1971 when the AFC divisional championship game between the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[Miami Dolphins]] went into overtime.

North American professional sports using a sudden-death method of settling a tied game include the modified version now employed by the  [[National Football League]], the [[National Hockey League]] and, also in a modified sense, the [[PGA Tour]] ([[golf]]).  [[Baseball]] uses a unique method of tie-breaking that incorporates elements of sudden death.  In some [[Goal (sport)|goal]]-scoring games sudden-death extra time may be given in which the first goal scored wins; in association football it is called the ''[[golden goal]]'', although this has not been recognised since it was abolished from the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] in 2004 by [[FIFA]].  In baseball, a winning run scored by the home team in an extra inning is often referred to as a '''walk-off''', as the players can immediately walk off the field.

==American football==
Sudden death has been perceived as a particularly poor fit for [[gridiron football]] because the process gives an inherent advantage to the team who starts with possession of the ball: they can score and end the game immediately (even by driving a relatively short distance into [[field goal range]] and then kicking a [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goal]]), but the team on defense cannot (other than through far rarer scoring strategies such as the [[Interception|pick-six]] or the [[Safety (American football score)|safety]]).

All organized forms of American football have abolished pure sudden death for overtime as of the 2011 season. Most levels of the game, including [[high school football]] and [[college football]], never used it, instead either allowing ties to stand or using alternatives like the [[Kansas Playoff]]. The [[National Football League]] was an exception; the league used pure sudden death in its playoffs beginning in 1940 and in regular season matchups starting in 1974, finally modifying its process for playoffs in 2010 and then regular season games in 2011.

===National Football League===
Originally, all [[National Football League]] games tied at the end of regulation time ended as a tie. Late in the 1940 season, NFL President [[Carl Storck]] announced that sudden death periods would be authorized for any playoff game needed to decide either division title.  It was emphasized that this did not apply to the final championship game, which would crown co-champions in the event of a tie.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, November 19, 1940. [https://www.nytimes.com/1940/11/19/archives/novel-plan-adopted-to-decide-playoffs-pro-football-group-title.html Novel Plan Adopted to Decide Play-Offs],  p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Commissioner [[Elmer Layden]] approved a similar arrangement for the 1941 season, with the same limitation. In the years when it was within the rules, the [[NFL Championship Game]] only was tied in regulation in the 1958 NFL Championship Game. A tied game in regulation did not occur in the Super Bowl until [[Super Bowl LI]] (51).

Sudden death overtime was finally approved for the NFL championship game in 1946&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, April 30, 1946. Danzig, Allison, [https://www.nytimes.com/1946/04/30/archives/pro-giants-to-play-seven-home-games-all-national-league-elevens.html Pro Giants To Play Seven Home Games], p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and remains in effect now.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, December 18, 1948, [https://www.nytimes.com/1948/12/18/archives/cards-and-eagles-evenly-matched-but-chicago-team-on-basis-of-strong.html Cards And Eagles Evenly Matched], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York Times,  December 11, 1950, [https://www.nytimes.com/1950/12/11/archives/sudden-death-overtime-for-playoff-contests.html Sudden Death Overtime For Play-Off Contests], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  The first playoff game requiring overtime was the [[NFL Championship Game, 1958|1958 NFL Championship Game]].&lt;ref&gt;Gifford and Richmond, pg. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the NFL adopted a 15-minute sudden-death overtime period for regular-season games; in {{NFL year|2017}} it was cut to 10 minutes.  The game ended as a tie if neither team scores in overtime.  When a team gets near the [[end zone]], it typically tried to kick a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]].  An overtime game can also be won by scoring a [[touchdown]] (in such an event, the [[extra point]] is not attempted).  This usually happened on a play that began with field position far enough away from the end zone to make a field goal difficult if not impossible, but it can also result from a team choosing not to attempt a field goal until reaching fourth down, even if the team enters an easy field goal range; this strategy only works if the team can maintain possession of the ball and does not fumble the ball away, throw an interception or lose enough yardage to back out of field goal range.  Only thrice has an overtime game been won by a [[Safety (American football score)|safety]].  In recent years, sportscasters have referred to such scoring plays as "walk-offs," as both teams can walk off the field after the play.

Since the 2010–11 playoffs, in the post-season, each team was allowed at least one possession to score in overtime, unless the team receiving the kickoff scored a touchdown or if the defensive team scored a touchdown or safety on the same possession. True sudden death rules applied if both teams have had their initial possession and the game remains tied. This rule did not actually come into use during the 2010 playoffs, with the first overtime game under the new rules not occurring until 2011, with the [[Denver Broncos]] scoring a long touchdown on their first play from scrimmage against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. 

This rule was adopted for the start of the 2012 regular season.  It was adopted to counter the criticism that the outcome of overtime games was very frequently decided by the coin toss, as the team which won it usually attempted only enough offensive action to maneuver into field goal range and seldom made a real effort to score a touchdown.  In the regular season, games still tied after one full overtime period will continue to be allowed to end in a tie.

For information on games that have taken a long time under sudden death, see [[Overtime (sports)#Longest games|Overtime]].

===Arena football===
In [[arena football]], each team is allowed one overtime possession in the first overtime, after which whoever is ahead is the winner.  If the score is still tied, however, true sudden death rules apply thereafter.  (A similar, modified sudden death format, with a 10-minute limit, was used in the [[NFL Europa#Experimental rules|NFL Europa]] League.) This rule was implemented in the [[2007 Arena Football League season|2007 season]]; prior to this, the league used [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]], a fixed seven and one-half minute extra period; if the game was still tied at this point, it was recorded as a tied game.  This was later changed to a fifteen-minute maximum modified sudden death as above, but with a definite conclusion after one overtime period, again a tied game being recorded if the score was still equal.  (Only one tied game was recorded under each of the two prior overtime rules.) Since the beginning of the 2007 season, all Arena football games, both regular season and playoff, have been played to a victorious conclusion.  Any succeeding overtime periods are true sudden death periods. An exception is applied to second game of the 2018 semifinal series, provided one team wins the first game and the second game ends with the two-game aggregate score tied, the game will continue with a standard overtime even if the score of the second game is not tied.

==Association football==

{{Main|Golden goal}}
Sudden death has a controversial history in [[association football]]. Important matches were traditionally resolved by replaying the entire match, however in the era of television and tight travel schedules this is often impracticable. Replays are still used in some major competitions (like the [[FA Cup]]).

In many matches, if the score is tied after the full 90 minutes, a draw results; however, if one team must be eliminated, some form of tie-breaking must occur. Originally, two 15-minute halves of [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] were held and if the teams remained equal at the end of the halves, [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|kicks from the penalty mark]] are held.

To try to decrease the chances of requiring kicks from the penalty mark, the [[International Football Association Board|IFAB]], the world law making body of the sport, experimented with new rules. The [[golden goal]] rule transformed the overtime periods into sudden death until the periods were over, where shootouts would occur. As this became unpopular, the [[silver goal]] rule was instituted, causing the game to end if the scores were not equal after the first 15-minute period as well as the second. The silver goal has also fallen into disrepute so [[UEFA Euro 2004]] was the last event to use it; after which the original tie-breaking methods were restored.

The main criticism of golden goal is the quickness of ending the game, and the pressure on coaches and players. Once a goal is scored, the game is over and the opponent cannot attempt to answer the goal within the remaining time. Therefore, teams would place more emphasis on not conceding a goal rather than scoring a goal, and many golden goal extra time periods remained scoreless.

In [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] collegiate play in the United States, however, sudden death, adopted in 1997 for all championship play in addition to regular season play, remains. In 2005, the Division II Women's Championship game ended in sudden death as a goal was scored three minutes into the overtime to end the championship match.[http://www.soccertimes.com/ncaa/2005/wgames/dec03a.htm] Sudden death is also prevalent in youth play, for the safety of players.

If the teams are still tied after the initial allocated number in the penalty shoot-out, the game goes to sudden-death penalties, where each team takes a further one penalty each, repeated until only one team scores, resulting in the winning of the game.

==Badminton==
In [[badminton]], if a set is tied at 29-all, golden point is played; whoever scores this point wins it.

==Baseball and softball==
[[Baseball]] and [[softball]] are not true sudden-death sports, but they have one comparable situation.

Baseball and softball games cannot end until both teams have had an equal number of turns at bat, unless further play (by the home team if they lead after {{Frac|8|1|2}} innings) cannot affect the outcome.  In the final scheduled inning (typically, in professional and advanced amateur leagues the ninth inning, but usually the seventh for youth leagues and softball, and the sixth for leagues for subteens such as [[Little League]]), if the visitors complete their turn at bat and still trail the hosts, the game ends.  If the visitors lead or the game is tied, the hosts take their "last ups" at bat.  If the hosts should exceed the visitors' score, the game ends at the conclusion of the play on which the hosts take this insurmountable lead.  (If the final scheduled inning ends in a tie, multiple extra innings are played with the same implications as the final scheduled inning.)

The ability to bat last is an [[Home advantage|advantage of being the home team]].  It is said that "visitors must play to win; hosts need only play to tie" because tying forces an extra inning.

A tied game in the bottom of the final scheduled inning puts pressure on the visitors.  For example, with a runner on third base and fewer than two outs, the visitors cannot afford even to get certain types of out that would let the game-ending run score after the out.

A scoring play that ends the game is called a walk-off, because after the runner scores the winning run everyone can walk off the field.  A [[walk-off home run]] is an exception to the rule stated above; the game does not end when the winning run scores, but continues until the batter and all runners score (provided they run the bases correctly).

==Basketball==
[[Basketball]] does not traditionally employ sudden death to decide games; it instead uses multiple five-minute [[Overtime (sports)#Basketball|overtime]] periods to determine the result of games tied after regulation play. The entire overtime is played; if the game remains tied, this procedure is repeated.

The [[NBA Summer League]], a developmental summer league, employs sudden death basketball after the first overtime. The rules state ''Double overtime &amp; thereafter is sudden death (first team to score a point wins).'' In the first sudden death professional basketball game, [[Devin Ebanks]] hit a game winner with 45 seconds elapsed for the D-League Select team, beating the summer league [[Atlanta Hawks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nba/2014/07/13/nba-summer-league-introduces-sudden-death-basketball/12609323/|title=NBA Summer League introduces sudden death basketball|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of basketball does employ a sudden-death overtime. [[3x3 (basketball)|3x3]], a formalized version of the half-court three-on-three game, uses an untimed overtime period that ends by rule once either team has scored 2&amp;nbsp;points. In this form of the sport, shots taken from behind the "three-point" arc are worth 2&amp;nbsp;points and all other shots are worth 1&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/3x3/inside3x3/p/openNodeIDs/23267/selNodeID/23267/3x3-rules-of-the-game.html |title=3x3: Rules of the game |publisher=[[FIBA]] |accessdate=March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fencing==
An individual [[Fencing (sport)|fencing]] bout lasts for five touches in a poule match, or 15 touches in a direct elimination (DE) match in all three weapons (épée, foil, and sabre.  Although sabre bouts rarely go to full-time, the same time frames apply)  Matches are also timed (three minutes for a poule match, and three periods of three minutes for a DE). If neither fencer has reached five or 15 points within the time limit, the leading fencer is deemed the winner. However, if the fencers are tied after the allotted time, one minute of extra time is added.

Before resuming the bout, one fencer is randomly awarded "priority". The first fencer to score a valid hit within extra time wins the match; if no valid hits are scored within the time, that fencer with priority is declared the victor.

In the normal course of a match, there is a de facto sudden death situation if both fencers are tied at four (or 14) touches each. The final hit is called "la belle". The fencers may salute each other before playing for the final point.

==Golf==
In individual [[match play]], players level after the regulation 18 or 36 holes will play extra holes in sudden death.  In team tournaments, players may gain half a point each for a tie rather than play sudden death; this is the case in the [[Ryder Cup]], for example. In the [[Presidents Cup]], there was provision for a single-player sudden death shootout if the entire competition ended in a tie.  When this came to pass in [[2003 Presidents Cup|2003]], the tiebreak was unfinished at dusk.  There was no provision for an extra day's play, and both team captains agreed to declare the match tied and share the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/golf/2003-11-23-presidents-cup-day4_x.htm |title=Els-Woods playoff unable to settle Presidents Cup |last=Brennan |first=Christine |date=2003-11-25 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2009-01-29}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, professional [[stroke play]] golf tournaments ending in a tie were [[Playoff (golf)|played off]] the next day with an eighteen-hole match.  Modern considerations such as [[television]] coverage and the tight travel schedule of most leading golfers have led to this practice being almost entirely abandoned, and in all but the most important tournaments, the champion is determined by sudden death. All players tied after the completion of regulation play are taken to a predetermined hole, and then play it and others in order as needed. If at least two players are tied, player(s) who score higher on a hole than the other competitors is/are immediately eliminated, and those still tied continue play until one remaining player has a lower score for a hole than any of the others remaining, who is declared the winner.

Of the four men's [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]], only [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]] uses a sudden-death playoff format, first used in [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]]. Through [[2017 U.S. Open (golf)|2017]] (and last used in [[2008 U.S. Open (golf)|2008]]), the {{nowrap|[[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]}} had an 18-hole playoff at stroke play on the day after the main tournament, with sudden-death if needed after 18 holes. A two-hole aggregate playoff is used since [[2018 U.S. Open (golf)|2018]], followed by sudden-death if needed.&lt;ref name=abandn18&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/22586395/us-open-abandons-18-holes-2-hole-playoff |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |title=U.S. Open abandons 18 holes for 2-hole playoff |date=February 26, 2018 |accessdate=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; First used in [[1989 Open Championship|1989]], [[The Open Championship]] uses a four-hole total-stroke playoff, while the [[PGA Championship]] uses a three-hole total-stroke playoff, first used in [[2000 PGA Championship|2000]]. The PGA Championship introduced the sudden-death playoff to the majors in [[1977 PGA Championship|1977]]&lt;ref name=pgahist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pga.com/pgachampionship/2012/history/championship_history.cfm |publisher=PGA of America|title=PGA Championship: history|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used it seven times through [[1996 PGA Championship|1996]]. Sudden death is used if a tie exists at the end of the scheduled playoff.

==Ice hockey==
Sudden-death overtime has traditionally been used in playoff and championship games in hockey. It has been used in the [[National Hockey League]] throughout the league's history. The first NHL game with sudden-death overtime was game four of the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]]. Currently, the NHL, [[American Hockey League]], and [[ECHL]] also use the sudden-death system in their regular seasons, playing a five-minute overtime period when the score is tied at the end of regulation time.

In 2000, the AHL reduced the teams to four players each during the five-minute overtime.  (But any two-man advantage is administered with five-on-three play rather than four-on-two.)  The ECHL and NHL both changed to the four-on-four overtime format in 2001, with the [[International Olympic Committee]] following by no later than 2010. By 2015 the NHL went to the three-on-three format.  In the [[Southern Professional Hockey League|SPHL]], a class A minor league, the overtime is three-on-three, with the team that would be on the power play given a fourth, and a fifth attacker respectively instead, and any penalty in the final two minutes results in a [[penalty shot]] instead of a power play.

If neither team scores during this period, the teams use a penalty-shot shootout, consisting of three players in the NHL or five players in the minor leagues, to determine the winner.  In the NHL, if no team wins this shootout, a 1-by-1, sudden-death shootout ensues. No player may shoot twice until every non-goaltender on the bench has taken a shot.

During championship playoffs, however, all games are played to a conclusion resulting in a victory for one team and a loss for the other.  These are true sudden-death games, which have gone on into as many as six additional full 20-minute periods with five players, instead of the five-minute period with at least three players.

IIHF hockey uses a penalty-shot shootout for gold medal games if neither team scores after one 20-minute, sudden-death overtime period. The shootout is decided in best-of-5 rounds, then round by round (in other words, if one team scores in the 6th round or beyond and the other fails, the game ends, unlike most professional leagues), and players can shoot as many times as the team desires (first 5 rounds are done in order, then reversely thereafter; may use new or same players). (There is a 5-minute overtime in round-robin games [10 minutes in elimination/bronze medal games], plus the best-of-5-round [best-of-3 rounds in round robin] shootout procedure in elimination/bronze medal games.)

==Judo==
In the case of a tie in competition [[judo]], the match proceeds to Golden Score, another form of Sudden Death. Sudden Death in competition Judo consists of a 5 minute long match, during which the first competitor to achieve a score is awarded the match. Penalties in Judo award points to the other competitor, making fair-play of absolute importance. If no victor is decided in Golden Score, the match is decided based on a Referee's Decision. A Referee's Decision is a vote amongst the Referee and both Judges of the match.

==Mixed martial arts==
In [[mixed martial arts]] competitions that consist of an even number of rounds, a type of sudden death is sometimes used in the event that each competitor wins an equal number of points. This is not a true sudden death that ends on the first point scored, since MMA competitions do not generally score individual points. Rather, it is a final round of combat, the winner of which is declared the winner of the match. This particular rule, known as "Sudden Victory", has been commonly seen in previous seasons of the [[reality television]] show ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'' when the competition has consisted of two rounds.  A sudden victory round rule was also implemented in the tournament to decide [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]'s first Flyweight Champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mma-cagewriter/sudden-death-round-tap-ufc-flyweight-tournament-182515404.html |title=Sudden death round on tap for UFC’s flyweight tournament |first=Maggie |last=Handricks |publisher=Yahoo Sports |date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling==
Sudden death in wrestling is most commonly seen in Real Canadian Wrestling tournament matches, in which a victor must be decided. This happens in the case of a double knockout or double countout. In the United States, Sudden Death rules occurs mainly in an [[Iron Man match]] when there is a tie after the time limit have expired. (Most notably at [[Wrestlemania XII]] when the match between [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Bret Hart]] ended 0-0 after the 60 minute limit)

An example that invoked sudden death occurred in the [[Royal Rumble (2005)|2005 Royal Rumble]]. [[John Cena]] and [[Dave Batista|Batista]] were left, and both men's feet touched the ground at the same time. A comparable draw leading to sudden death might happen if the shoulders of a wrestler applying a submission move are on the mat.

==Rugby league==
{{further|List of National Rugby League golden point games}}
Drawn [[National Rugby League]] premiership and [[State of Origin series]] games are subject to sudden death extra time after 80 minutes of play, called the [[golden point]]. Golden point consists of two five-minute halves, with the teams swapping ends at the end of the first half.

Any score (try, penalty goal, or field goal) in golden point wins the game for the scoring team - no [[Try#Conversion|conversion]] is attempted if a try is the winning score.

In the NRL, the victor in golden point receives two competition points, the loser none.  In the event that no further scoring occurs, the game is drawn, and each team receives one point each.

==Rugby union==
In the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the [[Rugby World Cup]], a match drawn after 80 minutes does not proceed immediately to sudden death conditions. Two 10-minute extra time periods are played first, if scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for a single sudden-death period of 10 minutes to be played.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rugby World Cup|url = http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/tournament-rules|website = www.rugbyworldcup.com|access-date = 2016-02-09|last = rugbybworldcup.com|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160201091833/http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/tournament-rules|archivedate = 2016-02-01|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner.

However, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period.

==Tennis and volleyball==
In contrast with the usual sudden-death procedure of awarding the victory to the next side to score, [[tennis]] and [[volleyball]] require that the margin of victory be two.  A volleyball game tied at the target score continues until one team's score exceeds the other's by two points.

The traditional requirement that a tennis [[Tennis score|set]] be won by two games sometimes resulted in men's five-set matches lasting over six hours (including an [[Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships|8-hour 11-minute set at Wimbledon]]) or, in women's/doubles' three-set matches, lasting over three hours, which is a major disruption to a television schedule.  To shorten matches, sets tied at six games each can now be broken by a single tiebreaker game.  This is awarded to the first player to score seven points.  The winner must lead the loser by two points, so tiebreaker games can become lengthy in their own right.

Tiebreakers are not used in major tournaments in the final set, except at the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]] &amp; the [[Tennis at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10510">'''System archetypes''' are patterns of behavior of a [[system]]. Systems expressed by [[causal loop diagram|circles of causality]] have therefore similar [[structure]]. Identifying a system [[archetype]] and finding the [[lever]]age enables efficient changes in a system. The basic system archetypes and possible solutions of the problems are mentioned in the section ''[[#Examples of system archetypes|Examples of system archetypes]]''.&lt;ref name="ps"&gt;{{Citation| last=Senge | first=Peter M. | year=1990 | title=The Fifth Discipline | publisher=Doubleday/Currency | isbn=0-385-26094-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVZqAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental property of nature is that no cause can affect the past. System archetypes do not imply that current causes affect past effects.

== Circles of causality ==

The basic idea of [[system thinking]] is that every action triggers a reaction. In [[system dynamics]] this reaction is called [[feedback]]. There are two types of feedback – [[positive feedback|reinforcing feedback]] and [[negative feedback|balancing feedback]]. Sometimes a feedback (or a reaction) does not occur immediately – the process contains delays. Any system can be drawn as a [[diagram]] set up with circles of [[causality]] – including actions, feedbacks and delays.&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;

== Reinforcing feedback (+) ==

[[positive feedback|Reinforcing feedback]] (or amplifying feedback) accelerates the given trend of a process. If the trend is ascending, the reinforcing (positive) feedback will accelerate the growth. If the trend is descending, it will accelerate the decline. Falling of an avalanche is an example of the reinforcing feedback process.&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;

== Balancing feedback (−) ==

[[negative feedback|Balancing feedback]] (or stabilizing feedback) will work if any [[goal-state]] exists. Balancing process intends to reduce a gap between a current state and a desired state. The balancing (negative) feedback adjusts a present state to a desirable target regardless whether the trend is descending or ascending. An example of the balancing feedback process is staying upright on bicycle (when riding).&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;

== Delays ==

Delays in systems cause people to perceive a response to an action incorrectly. This causes an under- or overestimation of the needed action and results in [[oscillation]], instability or even breakdown.&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;

== Examples of system archetypes ==

The following System Archetyes describe the most common generic structures. Before effectively addressing a specific situation, the underlying pattern must be identified. The following Flow Diagram should help identifying these archetypes. The links between the different archetypes are an indicator of most common connections. Keep in mind that in every situation, there may be more possible ways to follow, though. Consider that everyone is located somewhere in the flow, and that every possible situation has its own advantages, down-sides, cave-ats, and options. Nevertheless, correctly identifying and understanding your situation is always the first step of solving your problem in a sustainable way.

[[File:SD Archetypes.png|alt=Overview of common System Dynamics Archetypes|thumb|924x924px|Overview of common System Dynamics Archetypes|none]]

=== Balancing process with delay ===

This archetype explains the system in which the response to action is delayed. If the agents do not perceive the delayed feedback, they might overshoot or underestimate the requisite action in order to reach their goals. This could be avoided by being patient or by accelerating reactions of the system to realized measures.
Example: [[supply chain]] ([[Beer distribution game|The Beer Game]])&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Balancing process with delay.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Balancing process with delay"''']]

=== Limits to growth ===

The unprecedented growth is produced by a reinforcing feedback process until the system reaches its peak. The halt of this growth is caused by limits inside or outside of the system. However, if the limits are not properly recognized; the former methods are continuously applied, but more and more aggressively. This results in the contrary of the desired state – a decrease of the system. The solution lies in the weakening or elimination of the cause of limitation.  
Example: [[dieting]], learning foreign languages&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt; 
[[File:Limits to growth.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Limits to growth"''']]
[[Attractiveness principle|Attractiveness Principle]] is an archetype derived from Limits to Growth. The main difference is that Attractiveness Principle assumes growth is limited with two or more factors.

=== Shifting the burden ===

The problem is handled by a simple solution with immediate effect, thereby "healing the symptoms". The primary source of the problem is overlooked, because its remedy is demanding and has no immediate outcome. The origin of the problem should be identified and solved in the long-term run during which the [[Substance dependence|addiction]] to the [[symptomatic treatment|symptomatic remedy]] decreases. 
Example: [[drug addiction]], paying debts by borrowing&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Shifting the burden.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Shifting the burden"''']]

=== Shifting the burden to the intervenor ===

A special case of the “Shifting the Burden” systems archetype that occurs when an intervenor is brought in to help solve an ongoing problem.  Over time, as the intervenor successfully handles the problem, the people within the system become less capable of solving the problem themselves.  They become even more dependent on the intervenor.  Examples:  ongoing use of outside consultants.

In simple terms, this is an archetype whereby a system grows increasingly dependent on an outside intervenor to help it function. In the short-term this works, but in the long term the system is unable to function on its  own due to the dependence on the intervention and eventually fails to perform.

[[File:Shifting the burden to the Intervenor.png|alt=|none|frame|'''Causal loop diagram "Shifting the burden to the intervenor"'''|387x387px]]

=== Eroding goals ===

A kind of shifting the burden archetype. As current problems need to be handled immediately, the long-term goals continuously decline. It can be avoided by sticking to the vision. 
Example: balancing the [[public debt]], sliding limits of [[environmental pollution]]&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Eroding goals.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Eroding goals"''']]

=== [[Escalation archetype|Escalation]] ===

This archetype could be seen as a [[non-cooperative game]] where both players suppose that just one of them can win. They are responding to actions of the other player in order to “defend themselves”. The aggression grows and can result in [[self-destructive behavior]]. The [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] can be broken by one agent stopping to react defensively and turn the game into cooperative one. 
Example: [[arms race]]&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Escalation.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Escalation"''']]

=== Success to successful ===

Two people or activities need the same limited resources. As one of them becomes more successful, more resources are assigned to him/it. The second one becomes less and less successful due to lacking resources, and “prove the right decision” to support the first one. Problems occur if the [[competition]] is unhealthy and interferes with the goals of the whole system. The two activities or agents might be decoupled or they should receive balanced amount of resources.
Examples: two products of one company, work vs. family&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Success to the successful.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Success to the successful"''']]

=== [[Tragedy of the commons]] ===

Agents use common [[scarcity|limited resource]] to profit individually. As the use of the resource is not controlled, the agents would like to continuously raise their [[Economics|benefits]]. The resource is therefore used more and more and the [[revenues]] of the agents are decreasing. The agents are intensifying their [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] until the resource is completely used up or seriously damaged. To protect common resources some form of [[regulation]] should be introduced.
Example: [[fish stocks]] (The Fishing Game)&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Tragedy of the commons.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Tragedy of the commons"''']]

=== Fixes that fail ===

In the [[fixes that fail]] archetype, the problem is solved by some fix (a specific [[solution]]) with immediate positive effect. Nonetheless, the “[[unintended consequence|side effects]]” of this solution turn out in the future. The best remedy seems to apply the same solution. 
Example: [[saving costs]] on [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], paying [[interest]] by other [[loans]] (with other interests)&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Fixes that fail.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Fixes that fail"''']]

=== [[Growth and underinvestment]] ===

The limit to growth is the current [[production capacity]]. It can be removed by sufficient [[investment]] in new capacities. If the investment is not aggressive enough (or it is too low), the capacities are overloaded, the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of services declines and the [[demand]] decreases. This archetype is especially important in capacity planning. &lt;ref name=SDACP&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spicar|first=Radim|title=System Dynamics Archetypes in Capacity Planning|journal=Procedia Engineering|date=4.3.2014|volume=69|issue=C|pages=1350–1355|doi=10.1016/j.proeng.2014.03.128|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705814003749|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teatr Tworzenia''', or '''The Theater of Creation''', Polish avant-garde theater, founded by [[Jarosław Pijarowski]]. According to the author's definition it is: "Uninstitutionalized form of realization of creative ideas, consisting on intuitive-improvisational thematic activities; Have on the goal of integration and promotion of creative thought (word, music, theater, paintings) in audio-visual forms.&lt;ref name="information about realization"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pawlewicz|first1=Jakub|last2=Pijarowski|first2=Jarosław|title=OFF – Życie bez dotacji|date=2015|publisher=Arcanus &amp; ICB Polska|location=Bydgoszcz|isbn=978-83-88079-33-7|page=11|ref=information about realization}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Theater of Creation does not have a permanent place, which is related to the idea -Live Act - live creation according to a previously accepted scenario, for the audience with no time, space or space constraints, more than once with the audience.&lt;ref name="interwiev with creator of TT"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Przybył|first1=Marlena|title="Zamek Dźwięku" - Tworzenie jest naszym wielkim szczęściem|url=http://www.pomorska.pl/wiadomosci/golub-dobrzyn/art/7236522,zamek-dzwieku-jarek-pijarowski-tworzenie-jest-naszym-wielkim-szczesciem,id,t.html|website=pomorska.pl|accessdate=6 July 2017|ref=interwiev with creator of TT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of Teatr Tworzenia (The Theater of Creation)== 
In the years 2006-2010 - the productions of The Theater of Creation were based on the basis of [[monographs]] and [[performative]] activities of Pijarowski (Scream Nudity, Di Logos Moon Di, Frozen in Monitoring) [[Warsaw]], [[London]] and [[Prague]].&lt;ref name="information about TT"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pawlewicz|first1=Jakub|last2=Pijarowski|first2=Jarosław|title=OFF – Życie bez dotacji|date=2015|publisher=Arcanus &amp; ICB Polska|location=Bydgoszcz|isbn=978-83-88079-33-7|page=12|ref=information about TT}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turning point has become monumental a theatrical-musical spectacle entitled "Sound Castle" from the series:"Castles of Sound"; Realized at [[Golub-Dobrzyń Castle]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="Information about Castle of Sound"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Przybył|first1=Marlena|title=awangardowi-tworcy-zbuduja-dla-siebie-i-dla-nas-zamek-dzwieku,id,t.html|url=http://www.pomorska.pl/wiadomosci/golub-dobrzyn/art/7235072,golubdobrzyn-awangardowi-tworcy-zbuduja-dla-siebie-i-dla-nas-zamek-dzwieku,id,t.html|website=pomorska.pl|accessdate=6 July 2017|ref=Information about Castle of Sound}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants included: Jorgos Skolias - initiator "The Sound of Peace", drummer Sławomir Ciesielski, Boguslaw Raatz, Timothy Sanford, visual artist: Xavier Bayle, Lukasz Wodyński and others.
Another great form was the first Polish avant-garde [[Oratorio]] "Terrarium" realized with [[Józef Skrzek]] &lt;ref name="Information about artist cooperation"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Skrzek|first1=Józef|title=Terrarium – Józef Skrzek &amp; Jarosław Pijarowski|url=http://skrzek.com/news/terrarium-jozef-skrzek-jaroslaw-pijarowski|website=skrzek.com|publisher=Skrzek|accessdate=6 July 2017|ref=Information about artist cooperation}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Saint Andrew Bobola's Church in Bydgoszcz]].&lt;ref name="Information about oratorio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Information about "Terrarium"|url=http://terrarium.art.pl/|website=terrarium.art.pl|publisher=Brain Active Records|accessdate=6 July 2017|ref=Information about oratorio - Terrarium}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, in connection with the 80th birthday of [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]. The musical and theater project entitled:[[:pl:The dream Off Penderecki|The dream Off Penderecki]]. 
In 2014 the first spectacle from the series "Czasoprzestrzeń - Live Forever " - based on J. Pijarowski's play: "Space-time", describing cases of the precursor life of Polish magic - [[Pan Twardowski]]. On the way back from the premiere of the show as the final show of the [[Bydgoszcz]] Festival "Ster on Bydgoszcz" there was a tragic accident,  which was the suspension of the performance of The Theater of Creations.&lt;ref name="information about accident"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bydgoscy artyści w szpitalu.

A '''telos''' (from the Greek τέλος for "end", "purpose", or "goal") is an end or purpose, in a fairly constrained sense used by philosophers such as [[Aristotle]].  It is the root of the term "[[teleology]]", roughly the study of purposiveness, or the study of objects with a view to their aims, purposes, or intentions.  Teleology figures centrally in Aristotle's [[biology]] and in his theory of [[Four causes|causes]].  It is central to nearly all philosophical theories of history, such as those of [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]].  One running debate in modern [[philosophy of biology]] is to what extent teleological language (as in the "purposes" of various organs or life-processes) is unavoidable, or is simply a shorthand for ideas that can ultimately be spelled out non-teleologically. [[Philosophy of action]] also makes essential use of teleological vocabulary: on [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]]'s account, an action is just something an agent does with an [[intention]]—that is, looking forward to some end to be achieved by the action.

In contrast to telos, [[techne]] is the rational method involved in producing an object or accomplishing a goal or objective; however, the two methods are not mutually exclusive in principle.

In philosophy, '''the Real''' is that which is the authentic, unchangeable truth. It may be considered a primordial, external dimension of experience, referred to as the [[Infinity|infinite]], [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] or [[noumenal]], as opposed to a reality contingent on [[sense perception]] and the material order. The Real is often considered irreducible to the [[symbolic order]] of lived experience, but may be gestured to in certain cases, such as the experience of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]].

==In psychoanalysis==
===Lacan===
For [[Jacques Lacan]], the order of the real is not only opposed to the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] but is also located beyond the [[The Symbolic|symbolic]]. Unlike the symbolic, which is constituted in terms of oppositions such as "presence" and "absence", there is no absence in the real. The symbolic opposition between "presence" and "absence" implies the possibility that something may be missing from the symbolic, the real is "always in its place: it carries it glued to its heel, ignorant of what might exile it from there." If the symbolic is a set of differentiated signifiers, the real is in itself undifferentiated: "it is without fissure." The symbolic introduces "a cut in the real," in the process of signification: "it is the world of words that creates the world of things." Thus the real emerges as that which is outside language: "it is that which resists symbolization absolutely." The real is impossible because it is impossible to imagine, impossible to integrate into the symbolic order. This character of impossibility and resistance to symbolization lends the real its traumatic quality.

The primordial Real in which a (pre-[[Oedipal]]) human subject is born is differentiated from the real which a subject integrated into the [[symbolic order]] experiences. In the former, the real is the continuous, “whole” reality without categories and the differential function of language. Following the [[mirror stage]], however, and the eventual entrance of the imaginary and the symbolic (the split of the subject between the conscious imaginary and the unconscious symbolic), the real may only be experienced as traumatic gaps in the symbolic order. An example of this are traumatic events such as natural disasters, which effectively break down the signification of everyday life and cause a rupture of something alien and unrecognizable, without the usual grammar of the symbolic that conditions how to make meaning of something and how to proceed.

One of the main methods of psychoanalysis is to drain the traumatic experiences of the real into the symbolic through free association. The analyst searches the analysand’s discourse for sounds, words, or images of fixation and through dialectization attempt to bring these fixations to the regular [[metonymy|metonymic]] flow of the (unconscious) symbolic order, thereby integrating the subject further into their fantasy, usually referred to as “traversing the fantasy.”&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Fink (psychoanalyst)|Bruce Fink]], ''The Lacanian Subject: Between Language and Jouissance'', Princeton University Press, 1997, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Žižek ===
Contemporary Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]] has expanded on Lacan's theories and described (at least) three modalities of the Real:&lt;ref name=Daly2004&gt;{{cite web|last=Daly|first=Glyn|title=Slavoj Zizek: A Primer|url=http://www.lacan.com/zizek-primer.htm|publisher=lacan dot com|accessdate=17 August 2012|year=2004|quote=The real Real is the hard limit that functions as the horrifying Thing (the Alien, Medusa's head, maelstrom and so on) - a shattering force of negation. The symbolic Real refers to the anonymous symbols and codes (scientific formulae, digitalisation, empty signifiers...) that function in an indifferent manner as the abstract "texture" onto which, or out of which, reality is constituted. In The Matrix, for example, the symbolic Real is given expression at the point where Neo perceives "reality" in terms of the abstract streams of digital output. In the contemporary world, Zizek argues that it is capital itself that provides this essential backdrop to our reality and as such represents the symbolic Real of our age (Zizek, 1999: 222; 276). With the ''imaginary real'' we have precisely the (unsustainable) dimension of fantasmatic excess-negation that is explored in Flatliners. This is why cyberspace is such an ambiguous imaginary realm.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "real Real": a horrific thing, that which conveys the sense of [[Horror (emotion)|horror]] in horror films
* The "symbolic real": the signifier reduced to a meaningless formula like [[quantum physics]], which cannot be understood in any meaningful way, only grasped through abstract mathematics.
* The "imaginary real": an unfathomable something that permeates things as a trace of the sublime. This form of the real becomes perceptible in the film ''[[The Full Monty]]'', in the fact of disrobing the unemployed protagonists completely; in other words, through this extra gesture of "voluntary" degradation, something else, of the order of the sublime, becomes visible. Žižek also used the film ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' as an example, where the "invaded" Austrians are depicted more like provincial fascists (blond, beautiful, historic dresses), while the Nazis are managers, bureaucrats, etc., "like cosmopolitan decadent corrupted Jews." He posits that the movie has a hidden pro-fascist message that is not directly seen but embedded in the texture.

==In philosophy&lt;!--linked from 'Rudolf Christoph Eucken'--&gt;==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Reality, says [[Rudolf Christoph Eucken]], is an independent spiritual world, unconditioned by the apparent world of sense. To know it and to live in it is man's true destiny. His point of contact with it is personality: the inward fount of his being: his heart, not his head. Man is real, and in the deepest sense alive, in virtue of this free personal life-principle within him; but he is bound and blinded by the ties set up between his surface-intelligence and the sense-world. The struggle for reality must be a struggle on man's part to transcend the sense-world, escape its bondage. He must renounce it, and be 're-born' to a higher level of consciousness; shifting his centre of interest from the natural to the spiritual plane. According to the thoroughness with which he does this, will be the amount of real life he enjoys. The initial break with the 'world,' the refusal to spend one’s life communing with one’s own cinematograph picture, is essential if the freedom of the infinite is to be attained. We are amphibious creatures: our life moves upon two levels at once—the natural and the spiritual. The key to the puzzle of man lies in the fact that he is "the meeting point of various stages of Reality." All his difficulties and triumphs are grounded in this. The whole question for him is, which world shall be central for him—the Real, vital, all-embracing life we call spirit, or the lower life of sense? Shall 'Existence,' the superficial obvious thing, or 'Substance,' the underlying verity, be his home? Shall he remain the slave of the senses with their habits and customs, or rise to a plane of consciousness, of heroic endeavour, in which—participating in the life of spirit—he knows reality because he is real?" ([[Evelyn Underhill]] (1911), ''Mysticism'', [https://archive.org/stream/mysticismstudyin00undeuoft#page/40/mode/2up p. 40])&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There are," says [[Plotinus]], "different roads by which this end [apprehension of the Infinite] may be reached. The love of beauty, which exalts the poet; that devotion to the One and that ascent of science which makes the ambition of the philosopher; and that love and those prayers by which some devout and ardent soul tends in its moral purity towards perfection. These are the great highways conducting to that height above the actual and the particular, where we stand in the immediate presence of the Infinite, who shines out as from the deeps of the soul." (Plotinus, Letter to Flaccus)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==In aesthetics==

Édouard Récéjac states: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;If the mind penetrates deeply into the facts of aesthetics, it will find more and more, that these facts are based upon an ideal identity between the mind itself and things. At a certain point the harmony becomes so complete, and the finality so close that it gives us actual emotion. The Beautiful then becomes the sublime; brief apparition, by which the soul is caught up into the true mystic state, and touches the Absolute, the Real. It is scarcely possible to persist in this Esthetic perception without feeling lifted up by it above things and above ourselves, in an ontological vision which closely resembles the Absolute of the Mystics. (Édouard Récéjac, ''Fondements de la Connaissance Mystique'' (1897), p. 74)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Emanation body==
===Indian Buddhism===
One early [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist text]], the ''[[Samaññaphala Sutta]]'', lists the ability to create a “mind-made body” (''manomāyakāya'') as one of the "fruits of the contemplative life".&lt;ref name="Fiordalis"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fiordallis|first1=David|title=Miracles and Superhuman Powers in South Asian Buddhist Literature|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/61721/dvf_1.pdf|publisher=University of Michigan|accessdate=22 April 2017|date=20 September 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170423064934/https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/61721/dvf_1.pdf|archivedate=23 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|117}} Commentarial texts such as the ''[[Patisambhidamagga]]'' and the ''[[Visuddhimagga]]'' state that this mind-made body is how [[Gautama Buddha]] and [[arhat]]s are able to travel into heavenly realms using the continuum of the mindstream ([[citta-santāna]]) and it is also used to explain the multiplication miracle of the Buddha as illustrated in the ''[[Divyavadana]]'', in which the Buddha multiplied his emanation body ("nirmita") into countless other bodies which filled the sky. A Buddha or other realized being is able to project many such "nirmitas" simultaneously in an infinite variety of forms in different realms simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Fiordalis"/&gt;{{rp|125–134}}

The Indian Buddhist philosopher [[Vasubandhu]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 4th to 5th century CE) defined ''nirmita'' as a [[siddhi]] or psychic power (Pali: ''iddhi'', Skt: ''[[ṛddhi]]'') developed through Buddhist discipline, concentrated discipline (''[[samadhi]]'') and wisdom in his seminal work on Buddhist philosophy, the ''[[Abhidharma-kosa|Abhidharmakośa]]''. [[Asanga]]'s ''Bodhisattvabhūmi'' defines nirmāṇa as a magical illusion and "basically, something without a material basis".&lt;ref name="Fiordalis"/&gt;{{rp|130}} The [[Madhyamaka]] school of philosophy sees all reality as empty of essence; all reality is seen as a form of nirmita or magical illusion.&lt;ref name="Fiordalis"/&gt;{{rp|158}}

===Tibetan Buddhism===
Emanation bodies—nirmanakaya, sprulsku, sprul-pa and so on—are connected to [[trikaya]], the Buddhist doctrine of the three bodies of the Buddha. They are usually emanation bodies of celestial beings, though "unrealized beings" such as humans may have their own emanation bodies or even ''be'' emanation bodies.&lt;ref name="Joffe"/&gt; For example, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] is considered by some followers to be an emanation-reincarnation or [[tulku]] of [[Chenrezig]], the Bodhisattva of Compassion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.dalailama.com/the-dalai-lama/biography-and-daily-life/birth-to-exile|title=The Dalai Lama - Biography and Daily Life|section=Birth to Exile|publisher=The Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama|accessdate=October 10, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019200618/https://www.dalailama.com/the-dalai-lama/biography-and-daily-life/birth-to-exile|archivedate=October 19, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 14th Dalai Lama mentioned in a public statement that his successor might appear via emanation while the current Dalai Lama is still alive.&lt;ref name="Joffe"/&gt;

==Tulpa==
20th century [[theosophist]]s adapted the concepts of "emanation body"—nirmita, tulku, sprul-pa and others—into the concepts of "tulpa" and "thoughtform".&lt;ref name="Mikles"/&gt; The term “thoughtform” is used as early as 1927 in [[Evans-Wentz]]' translation of the [[Bardo Thodol|Tibetan Book of the Dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans-Wentz|first1=W.T.|title=The Tibetan Book of the Dead: Or The After-Death Experiences on the Bardo Plane, according to Lāma Kazi Dawa-Samdup's English Rendering|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0198030517|pages=29-32, 103, 123, 125}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Myrdhin Reynolds in a note to his English translation of the life story of [[Garab Dorje]] defines a ''tulpa'' as “an emanation or a manifestation.”&lt;ref name="Rinpoche"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rinpoche|first1=Dza Patrul|title=The Golden Letters: The Three Statements of Garab Dorje, the First Teacher of Dzogchen|date=1996|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=Ithaca, New York|isbn=9781559390507|page=350|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Alexandra David-Néel===
{{primary|section|reason=Find additional secondary sources that evaluate the content in a critical way.|date=October 2017}}
Belgian-French explorer, spiritualist, and Buddhist [[Alexandra David-Néel]] claimed to have observed these mystical practices in 20th century Tibet.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; She reported tulpas are "magic formations generated by a powerful concentration of thought."&lt;ref name="David-Neel"&gt;{{cite book|last1=David-Neel|first1=Alexandra|last2=DʼArsonval|first2=A.|title=Magic and Mystery in Tibet|date=2000|publisher=Book Tree|location=Escondido, California|isbn=1585090972}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|331}} David-Néel wrote that "an accomplished [[Bodhisattva]] is capable of effecting ten kinds of magic creations. The power of producing magic formations, [[tulkus]] or less lasting and materialized tulpas, does not, however, belong exclusively to such mystic exalted beings. Any human, divine or demoniac being may be possessed of it. The only difference comes from the degree of power, and this depends on the strength of the concentration and the quality of the mind itself."&lt;ref name="David-Neel"/&gt;{{rp|115}}

David-Néel wrote of the tulpa's ability to develop a mind of its own: "Once the tulpa is endowed with enough vitality to be capable of playing the part of a real being, it tends to free itself from its maker's control. This, say Tibetan occultists, happens nearly mechanically, just as the child, when his body is completed and able to live apart, leaves its mother's womb."&lt;ref name="David-Neel"/&gt;{{rp|283}} David-Néel claimed to have created a tulpa in the image of a jolly [[Friar Tuck]]-like [[monk]] which later developed a life of its own and had to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marshall|first1=Richard|last2=Davis|first2=Monte|last3=Moolman|first3=Valerie|last4=Zappler|first4=George|title=Mysteries of the Unexplained|date=1982|publisher=Reader's Digest Association|location=Pleasantville, NewYork|isbn=0895771462|page=176|edition=Reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; David-Néel raised the possibility that her experience was illusory: "I may have created my own hallucination", though she reports that others could see the thoughtforms that have been created.&lt;ref name="David-Neel"/&gt;{{rp|176}}

The [[Western esotericism|Western occult]] understanding of the concept of "thoughtform" is believed by some to have originated as an interpretation of the Tibetan concept of "tulpa".&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; The concept is related to the Western philosophy and practice of [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cunningham|first1=David Michael|last2=Ellwood|first2=Taylor|last3=Wagener|first3=Amanda R.|title=Creating Magickal Entities: A Complete Guide to Entity Creation|date=2003|publisher=Egregore Publishing|location=Perrysburg, Ohio|isbn=9781932517446|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2017}} Occultist [[William Walker Atkinson]] in his book ''The Human Aura'' described thought-forms as simple ethereal objects emanating from the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]]s surrounding people, generating from their thoughts and feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Panchadsi|first1=Swami|authorlink=William Walker Atkinson|title=The Human Aura: Astral Colors and Thought Forms|date=1912|publisher=Yoga Publication Society|pages=47–54|url=https://borderlandsciences.org/project/aura/ref/panchadasi/ch6.html|accessdate=26 April 2017|chapter=Thought Form|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003151932/https://borderlandsciences.org/project/aura/ref/panchadasi/ch6.html|archivedate=3 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further elaborated in ''Clairvoyance and Occult Powers'' how experienced practitioners of the occult can produce thoughtforms from their auras that serve as [[astral projection]]s which may or may not look like the person who is projecting them, or as illusions that can only be seen by those with "awakened astral senses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Panchadsi|first1=Swami|title=Clairvoyance and Occult Powers|date=1916|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12480/12480.txt|accessdate=26 April 2017|chapter=Strange astral phenomena|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626055033/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12480/12480.txt|archivedate=26 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] Annie Besant, in her book [[Thought-Forms (book)|''Thought-forms'']], divides them into three classes: forms in the shape of the person who creates them, forms that resemble objects or people and may become "ensouled" by "nature spirits" or by the dead, and forms that represent "inherent qualities" from the astral or mental planes, such as emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Besant|first1=Annie|authorlink=Annie Besant|last2=Leadbeater|first2=C.

==Tulpas in modern Western society==
The concept of tulpa was popularized and secularized in the Western world through fiction, gaining popularity on television in the late 1990s and 2000s.&lt;ref name="Joffe"/&gt; In 2009, anonymous posters on the discussion board [[4chan]] started experimenting with creating tulpas, and the community gained popularity through the emergence of the [[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fandom|''My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic'' fandom]].&lt;ref name="Vice"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Nathan|title=Meet the 'Tulpamancers': The Internet's Newest Subculture Is Incredibly Weird|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/tulpamancy-internet-subculture-892|website=VICE|accessdate=2017-04-22|language=en-uk|date=2014-09-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215182444/http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/tulpamancy-internet-subculture-892 |archivedate=2016-12-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropologist and cognitive scientist Samuel Veissiere wrote that on February 2015 the Reddit forum, which carries most of the tulpamancy conversations in English, had 7740 members, but less than 200 active posters. The fans attempted to use meditation and lucid dreaming techniques to create [[imaginary friend]]s.&lt;ref name="Veissière"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Veissière|first1=Samuel|title=Varieties of Tulpa Experiences: The Hypnotic Nature of Human Sociality, Personhood, and Interphenomenality|work=Hypnosis and meditation: Towards an integrative science of conscious planes|editor1=Amir Raz|editor2=Michael Lifshitz|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=T.

These individuals, calling themselves "tulpamancers", treat the tulpas as a "real or somewhat-real person". The number of active participants in these online communities is in the low hundreds, and few meetings in person have taken place. They belong to "primarily urban, middle class, Euro-American adolescent and young adult demographics" and they "cite loneliness and social anxiety as an incentive to pick up the practice." 93.7% of respondents expressed that their involvement with the creation of tulpas has "made their condition better", and led to new unusual sensory experiences. Some practitioners have sexual and romantic interactions with their tulpas, though the practice is controversial and trending towards [[taboo]]. One survey found that 8.5% support a metaphysical explanation of tulpas, 76.5% support a neurological or psychological explanation, and 14% "other" explanations.&lt;ref name="Veissière"/&gt;

The '''World Day of Peace''' is a feast day of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] dedicated to [[world peace|universal peace]], held on 1 January, the [[Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God]]. [[Pope Paul VI]] established it in 1967, being inspired by the encyclical ''[[Pacem in Terris]]'' of [[Pope John XXIII]] and with reference to his own encyclical ''[[Populorum Progressio]]''. The day was first observed on 1 January 1968.

World Day of Peace often has been an occasion on which the Popes made [[Magisterium|magisterial]] declarations of [[Catholic social teaching|social doctrine]]. [[Pope Paul VI]] and [[Pope John Paul II]] made important declarations on the Day in each year of their pontificates regarding the [[United Nations]], [[human rights]], [[women's rights]], [[labor union|labor unions]], [[economic development]], [[right to life|the right to life]], international [[diplomacy]], peace in the [[Holy Land]] ([[Israel]]), [[globalization]], and [[terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/60000705.html?dids=60000705:60000705&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Dec+19%2C+1990&amp;author=WILLIAM+D.+MONTALBANO&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Pope+Assails+Totalitarianism%2C+Intolerance+Religion%3A+John+Paul%2C+in+World+Day+of+Peace+message%2C+also+calls+fundamentalism+a+threat+to+peace.&amp;pqatl=google ''Pope Assails Totalitarianism, Intolerance of Religion: John Paul, in World Day of Peace Message, Also Calls Fundamentalism a Threat to Peace.''] ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England and Wales]], "Peace Sunday" is traditionally observed on the Second Sunday of Ordinary Time, which is the Sunday occurring between 14 and 20 January, inclusive. The British branch of the [[Pax Christi]] movement prepares suggested material for it annually.&lt;ref&gt;Letter of Bishop Malcolm McMahon to Catholic Parishes in England and Wales for Peace Sunday 2012, partially quoted in [http://www.paxchristi.org.uk/press1.php].&lt;/ref&gt;
