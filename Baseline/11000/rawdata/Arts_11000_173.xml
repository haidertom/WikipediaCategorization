==Content==
It deals with standard problems in the theory of [[personal identity]] in the form of a dialogue between a terminally ill university professor at a small Midwestern college,, Gretchen Weirob, and her two friends, Sam Miller and Dave Cohen. The views represented include those of [[Bernard Williams]], [[John Locke]], and [[Derek Parfit]]. The format of associating different philosophical positions with different characters in a dialogue recalls [[David Hume]]'s ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.

The '''''Allegory of Divine Providence and Barberini Power''''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/findrome/images/imagefiles/fresco/divine.html Image Files-Frescos]&lt;/ref&gt; is a fresco by Italian painter [[Pietro da Cortona]], filling the large ceiling of the grand salon of the [[Palazzo Barberini]] in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. Begun in 1633, it was nearly finished in three years; upon Cortona's return from Venice, it was extensively reworked to completion in 1639. The Palazzo, since the 1620s, had been the palatial home of the [[Barberini|Barberini family]] headed by Maffeo Barberini, by then [[Urban VIII]], who had launched an extensive program of refurbishment of the city with art and architecture.

==Composition==

These commissioned artworks often teem with suns and bees (the Barberini family coat of arms had three bees), as also the Cortona fresco does. At one end of the sky sits the eminent solar Divine Providence, while at the other end are putti and flying maidens holding aloft the papal keys, tiara, with robe belt above a swarm of heraldic giant golden bees. Below Providence, the simulated frame crumbles. Time with a scythe seems to swallow a putti's arm. A starry [[Crown of Immortality]] is ferried up to the heraldic swarm. Some scholars have suggested that one of the fresco's goals was to portray the Barberini papal election, which had been rumored to have been rigged, as divine providence. At one edge, are laborers in a forge so hard at work, they shatter the outer frame.

== Critical assessment and legacy==

Frescoes were numerous in Rome at the time; most represented galleries of framed episodes, ''[[quadro riportato]]'' such as found on the ceilings of the [[Sistine Chapel]] ceiling or in [[Annibale Carracci]]'s [[Palazzo Farnese]] (completed in 1601) cycle. [[Baldassare Peruzzi]] had pioneered this style of painting called [[quadratura]], in which the fresco replaces or simulates some of the architectural framework, using often forced perspective. Such [[trompe-l'oeil]] artifices were not novel to Italian art, since for example [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]] and [[Giulio Romano]] in [[Mantua]] had featured such frescoes; however, for Cortona, the luminous sky became a teeming tour de force, a style that became influenced many other large fresco spectacles such as those by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] for example, in Madrid,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/8madrid/|Allegorical ceiling in [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] by Tiepolo.]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl|Ehrenstrahl]] in his "Council of the Virtues" from the [[House of Nobility (Sweden)|House of Nobility]], in [[Stockholm]] and in the frescoes depicting the ''Apotheosis of the Pisani Family'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://gallery.euroweb.hu/html/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/7_1760s/10pisan1.html ''Apotheosis of the Pisani Family''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315215956/http://gallery.euroweb.hu/html/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/7_1760s/10pisan1.html |date=2005-03-15 }} by Tiepolo at Villa Pisani in Stra.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Villa Pisani at Stra]]. Other famous ''[[sotto in su]]'' frescoes in Rome include [[Andrea Pozzo]]'s ''Apotheosis of St Ignatius'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/html/p/pozzo/apotheos.html ''Apotheosis of St. Ignatius''] by Pozzo&lt;/ref&gt; at the Roman church of [[Sant'Ignazio]].

'''''An Area of Darkness''''' is a book written by [[V. S. Naipaul]] in 1964. It is a [[Travel literature|travelogue]] detailing Naipaul's trip through India in the early sixties. It was the first of Naipaul's acclaimed Indian trilogy which includes ''[[India: A Wounded Civilization]]'' and ''[[India: A Million Mutinies Now]]''.  The narration is anecdotal and descriptive.

A deeply pessimistic work, ''An Area of Darkness'' conveys the acute sense of disillusionment which the author experiences on his first visit to his ancestral land. The book was immediately banned in India for its "negative portrayal of India and its people".&lt;ref name="Hindu"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thehindu.com/books/you-cant-read-this-book/article2953626.ece | title=You can't read this book | work=[[The Hindu]] | accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Analects''''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|論|語}}}}; [[Old Chinese]]: ''*run ŋ(r)aʔ''; {{zh|p=''lúnyǔ''|l=Edited Conversations}}),&lt;ref&gt;[[wiktionary:Appendix:Baxter-Sagart Old Chinese reconstruction]]&lt;/ref&gt; also known as the '''''Analects of Confucius''''', is a collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]] and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been compiled and written by Confucius's followers. It is believed to have been written during the [[Warring States period]] (475–221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-[[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the ''Analects'' was considered merely a "commentary" on the [[Five Classics]], but the status of the ''Analects'' grew to be one of the central texts of [[Confucianism]] by the end of that dynasty. 

During the late [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) the importance of the ''Analects'' as a [[philosophical|philosophy]] work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the "[[Four Books]]". The ''Analects'' has been one of the most widely-read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and [[Eastern philosophy#East Asian philosophies|East Asian thought and values]] today.

Confucius believed that the welfare of a country depended on the moral cultivation of its people, beginning from the nation's leadership. He believed that individuals could begin to cultivate an all-encompassing sense of virtue through ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|ren]]'', and that the most basic step to cultivating ''ren'' was [[Filial piety|devotion to one's parents]] and older siblings. He taught that one's individual desires do not need to be suppressed, but that people should be educated to reconcile their desires via [[Li (Confucian)|rituals and forms of propriety]], through which people could demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society. He taught that a ruler's sense of [[De (Chinese)|virtue]] was his primary prerequisite for leadership. His primary goal in educating his students was to produce [[Junzi|ethically well-cultivated men]] who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things.

==History==

===Creation of the text===
[[File:Confucius 02.png|thumb|Portrait of Confucius, giving a lecture]]
[[File:Analects.JPG|thumb|''The Analects of Confucius'', from [[Östasiatiska Museet]], Stockholm]]
According to [[Ban Gu]], writing in the ''[[Book of Han]]'', the ''Analects'' originated as individual records kept by Confucius's disciples of conversations between the Master and them, which were then collected and jointly edited by the disciples after Confucius's death in 479 BC.  The work is therefore titled ''Lunyu'' meaning "edited conversations" or "selected speeches" (i.e. analects).{{sfnp|Knechtges|Shih|2010|p=645}}{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2010|p=25}}  This broadly forms the traditional account of the genesis of the work accepted by later generations of scholars, for example the [[Song dynasty]] neo-Confucian scholar [[Zhu Xi]] stated that ''Analects'' is the records of Confucius's first- and second-generation pupils.{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2013|p=26}} The view however was challenged by Qing dynasty [[philologist]] Cui Shu (崔述, 1740–1816) who argued  on linguistic ground that the last five books are much later than the rest of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nqb0Fa8Umv4C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucius and the Analects : New Essays|author= Bryan W. Van Norden|page=13 |publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2002|isbn=9780195350821 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Slingerland|2003|pp=xiii-xiv}} Many modern scholars now believe that the work was compiled over a period of around two hundred years, with some questioning the authenticity of some of the sayings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ID4gMCaLr0MC&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucius and Confucianism: The Essentials|author=Lee Dian Rainey |page=10|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2010 |isbn=9781444323603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~p374/Analects_of_Confucius_(Eno-2015).pdf |title=The Analects of Confucius |author=Robert Eno  |year=2015 |work=Indiana University }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because no texts of the ''Analects'' have been discovered earlier, and because the ''Analects'' was not referred to by name in any existing source before the early Han dynasty, some scholars have proposed dates as late as 140 BC for the text's compilation.&lt;ref&gt;Els 21–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of how early the text of the ''Analects'' existed, most ''Analects'' scholars believe that, by the early [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–220 AD) the book was widely known and transmitted throughout China in a mostly complete form, and the book acquired its final, complete form during Han dynasty.  A Han dynasty writer [[Wang Chong]] however claimed that the ''Analects'' that existed during the Han dynasty was incomplete and formed only a part of a much larger work.{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2010|pp=25–26}}  A larger collection of Confucius's teachings existed in the Warring States period than has been preserved directly in the ''Analects'': 75% of Confucius's sayings cited by his second-generation student, [[Mencius]], do not exist in the received text of the ''Analects''.&lt;ref&gt;Waley 23&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Han dynasty scholar [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]], there were two versions of the ''Analects'' that existed at the beginning of the Han dynasty: the "[[Lu (state)|Lu]] version" and the "[[Qi (state)|Qi]] version". The Lu version contained twenty chapters, and the Qi version contained twenty-two chapters, including two chapters not found in the Lu version. Of the twenty chapters that both versions had in common, the Lu version had more passages. Each version had its own masters, schools, and transmitters.&lt;ref name=Gardner71516&gt;Gardner 7, 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;  In the reign of [[Emperor Jing of Han]] (r. 157–141 BC), a third version (the "[[Old Text]]" version) was discovered hidden in a wall of the home then believed to be Confucius's when the home was in the process of being destroyed by King Gong of Lu (r. 153–128 BC) in order to expand the king's palace. The new version did not contain the two extra chapters found in the Qi version, but it split one chapter found in the Lu and Qi versions in two, so it had twenty-one chapters, and the order of the chapters was different.&lt;ref name=Gardner71516 /&gt; The old text version got its name because it was written in characters not used since the earlier Warring States period (i.e. before 221 BC), when it was assumed to have been hidden.&lt;ref name="E20"&gt;Els 20&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Han dynasty scholar [[Huan Tan]], the old text version had four hundred characters different from the Lu version (from which the received text of the ''Analects'' is mostly based), and it seriously differed from the Lu version in twenty-seven places. Of these twenty-seven differences, the received text only agrees with the old text version in two places.&lt;ref name="W24"&gt;Waley 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Over a century later, the tutor of the ''Analects'' to [[Emperor Cheng of Han]], [[:zh:张禹 (西汉)|Zhang Yu]] (d. 5 BC), synthesized the Lu and Qi versions by taking the Lu version as authoritative and selectively adding sections from the Qi version, and produced a composite text of the ''Analects'' known as the "Zhang Hou Lun". This text was recognized by Zhang Yu's contemporaries and by subsequent Han scholars as superior to either individual version, and is the text that is recognized as the ''Analects'' today.&lt;ref name=Gardner71516 /&gt; The Qi version was lost for about 1800&amp;nbsp;years but re-found during the excavation of the tomb of [[Marquis of Haihun]] that was found 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0113/56820.html |title=Qi version of 'Analects of Confucius' discovered in Haihunhou tomb |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=The Institute of Archaeology |access-date=15 January 2017 |quote= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116174212/http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0113/56820.html |archivedate=16 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No complete copies of either the Lu version or the old text version of the ''Analects'' exist today,&lt;ref name="E20" /&gt; though fragments of the old text version were discovered at [[Dunhuang manuscripts|Dunhuang]].&lt;ref name="W24" /&gt;

Before the late twentieth century the oldest existing copy of the ''Analects'' known to scholars was found in the "Stone Classics of the Xinping Era", a copy of the Confucian classics written in stone in the old Eastern Han dynasty capital of [[Luoyang]] around 175 AD. Archaeologists have since discovered two handwritten copies of the ''Analects'' that were written around 50 BC, during the Western Han dynasty. They are known as the "[[Dingzhou]] ''Analects''", and the "[[Pyongyang]] ''Analects''", after the location of the tombs in which they were found. The Dingzhou ''Analects'' was discovered in 1973, but no transcription of its contents was published until 1997. The Pyongyang ''Analects'' was discovered in 1992. Academic access to the Pyongyang ''Analects'' has been highly restricted, and no academic study on it was published until 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Els 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dingzhou ''Analects'' was damaged in a fire shortly after it was entombed in the Han dynasty. It was further damaged in [[1976 Tangshan earthquake|an earthquake]] shortly after it was recovered, and the surviving text is just under half the size of the received text of the ''Analects''. Of the sections that survive, the Dingzhou ''Analects'' is shorter than the received ''Analects'', implying that the text of the ''Analects'' was still in the process of expansion when the Dingzhou ''Analects'' was entombed. There was evidence that "additions" may have been made to the manuscript after it had been completed, indicating that the writer may have become aware of at least one other version of the ''Analects'' and included "extra" material for the sake of completeness. The content of the Pyongyang ''Analects'' is similar to the Dingzhou ''Analects''; but, because of the secrecy and isolationism of the [[North Korea]]n government, only a very cursory study of it has been made available to international scholars, and its contents are not completely known outside of North Korea. Scholars do not agree about whether either the Dingzhou ''Analects'' or the Pyongyang ''Analects'' represent the Lu version, the Qi version, the old text version, or a different version that was independent of these three traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Els 6, 10–11, 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance within Confucianism===
During most of the Han period the ''Analects'' was not considered one of the principal texts of [[Confucianism]]. During the reign of [[Han Wudi]] (141–87 BC), when the Chinese government began promoting Confucian studies, only the [[Five Classics]] were considered by the government to be canonical (''jing''). They were considered Confucian because Confucius was assumed to have partially written, edited, and/or transmitted them. The ''Analects'' was considered secondary as it was thought to be merely a collection of Confucius's oral "commentary" (''zhuan'') on the Five Classics.&lt;ref name="G7"&gt;Gardner 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The political importance and popularity of Confucius and Confucianism grew throughout the Han dynasty, and by the [[Han Dynasty|Eastern Han]] the ''Analects'' was widely read by schoolchildren and anyone aspiring to literacy, and often read before the Five Classics themselves. During the Eastern Han, the heir apparent was provided a tutor specifically to teach him the ''Analects''. The growing importance of the ''Analects'' was recognized when the Five Classics was expanded to the "Seven Classics": the Five Classics plus the ''Analects'' and the ''[[Classic of Filial Piety]]'', and its status as one of the central texts of Confucianism continued to grow until the late [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), when it was identified and promoted as one of the [[Four Books]] by [[Zhu Xi]] and generally accepted as being more insightful than the older Five Classics.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 8, 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentaries===
[[File:Commentaries of the Analects of Confucius.jpg|thumb|right|A copy of He Yan's commentary on the ''Analects'', with a sub-commentary by [[Xing Bing]], printed during the [[Ming dynasty]]]]
Since the Han dynasty, Chinese readers have interpreted the ''Analects'' by reading scholars' commentaries on the book. There have been many commentaries on the ''Analects'' since the Han dynasty, but the two which have been most influential have been the ''Collected Explanations of the Analects'' (''Lunyu Jijie'') by [[He Yan]] (c.&amp;nbsp;195–249) and several colleagues, and the ''Collected Commentaries of the Analects'' (''Lunyu Jizhu'') by [[Zhu Xi]] (1130–1200). In his work, He Yan collected, selected, summarized, and rationalized what he believed to be the most insightful of all preceding commentaries on the ''Analects'' which had been produced by earlier Han and [[Cao Wei|Wei dynasty]] (220–265&amp;nbsp;AD) scholars. His personal interpretation of the ''Lunyu'' was guided by his belief that [[Daoism]] and [[Confucianism]] complemented each other, so that by studying both in a correct manner a scholar could arrive at a single, unified truth. Arguing for the ultimate compatibility of Daoist and Confucian teachings, he argued that "Laozi [in fact] was in agreement with the Sage" (sic). The ''Explanations'' was written in 248&amp;nbsp;AD, was quickly recognized as authoritative, and remained the standard guide to interpreting the ''Analects'' for nearly 1,000 years, until the early [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271–1368). It is the oldest complete commentary on the ''Analects'' that still exists.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 8, 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

He Yan's commentary was eventually displaced as the definitive, standard commentary by Zhu Xi's commentary. Zhu Xi's work also brought together the commentaries of earlier scholars (mostly from the Song dynasty), along with his own interpretations. Zhu's work took part in the context of a period of renewed interest in Confucian studies, in which Chinese scholars were interested in producing a single "correct" intellectual orthodoxy that would "save" Chinese traditions and protect them from foreign influences, and in which scholars were increasingly interested in metaphysical speculation.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 18–20, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In his commentary Zhu made a great effort to interpret the ''Analects'' by using theories elaborated in the other Four Books, something that He Yan had not done. Zhu attempted to give an added coherence and unity to the message of the ''Analects'', demonstrating that the individual books of the Confucian canon gave meaning to the whole, just as the whole of the canon gave meaning to its parts. In his preface, Zhu Xi stated, "[T]he ''Analects'' and the ''[[Mencius (book)|Mencius]]'' are the most important works for students pursuing the [[Tao|Way]] [...] The words of the ''Analects'' are all inclusive; what they teach is nothing but the essentials of preserving the mind and cultivating [one's] nature." From the first publication of the ''Commentaries'', Zhu continued to refine his interpretation for the last thirty years of his life. In the fourteenth century, the [[Ming dynasty|Chinese government]] endorsed Zhu's commentary, and until 1905 it was read and memorized along with the ''Analects'' by all Chinese aspiring to literacy and employment as government officials.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 7–8, 21, 46&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Very few reliable sources about Confucius exist besides that of the Analects. The principal biography available to historians is included in [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Shiji]]'', but, because the ''Shiji'' contains a large amount of (possibly legendary) material not confirmed by extant sources, the biographical material on Confucius found in the ''Analects'' makes the ''Analects'' arguably the most reliable source of biographical information about Confucius.&lt;ref&gt;Lau ix&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius viewed himself as a "transmitter" of  social and political traditions originating in the early [[Zhou dynasty]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1000–800 BC), and claimed not to have originated anything (''Analects'' 7.1), but Confucius's social and political ideals were not popular in his time.&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;Riegel "2. Confucius' Social Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social philosophy===
Confucius's discussions on the nature of the supernatural (''Analects'' 3.12; 6.20; 11.11) indicate that he believed while "ghosts" and "spirits" should be respected, they are best kept at a distance. Instead human beings should base their values and social ideals on moral philosophy, tradition, and a natural love for others. Confucius's social philosophy largely depended on the cultivation of [[Ren (Confucianism)|''ren'']] by every individual in a community.&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; Later Confucian philosophers explained ''ren'' as the quality of having a kind manner, similar to the English words "humane", "altruistic", or "benevolent", but, of the sixty instances in which Confucius discusses ''ren'' in the ''Analects'', very few have these later meanings. Confucius instead used the term ''ren'' to describe an extremely general and all-encompassing state of virtue, one which no living person had attained completely. (This use of the term ''ren'' is peculiar to the ''Analects''.)&lt;ref&gt;Waley 27–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the ''Analects'', Confucius's students frequently request that Confucius define ''ren'' and give examples of people who embody it, but Confucius generally responds indirectly to his students' questions, instead offering illustrations and examples of behaviours that are associated with ''ren'' and explaining how a person could achieve it. According to Confucius, a person with a well-cultivated sense of ''ren'' would speak carefully and modestly (''Analects'' 12.3); be resolute and firm (''Analects'' 12.20), courageous (''Analects'' 14.4), free from worry, unhappiness, and insecurity (''Analects'' 9.28; 6.21); moderate their desires and return to propriety (''Analects'' 12.1); be respectful, tolerant, diligent, trustworthy and kind (''Analects'' 17.6); and love others (''Analects'' 12.22). Confucius recognized his followers' disappointment that he would not give them a more comprehensive definition of ''ren'', but assured them that he was sharing all that he could (''Analects'' 7.23).&lt;ref&gt;Gardner 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

To Confucius, the cultivation of ''ren'' involved depreciating oneself through modesty while avoiding artful speech and ingratiating manners that would create a false impression of one's own character (''Analects'' 1.3). Confucius said that those who had cultivated ''ren'' could be distinguished by their being "simple in manner and slow of speech." He believed that people could cultivate their sense of ''ren'' through exercising the inverted [[Golden Rule]]: "Do not do to others what you would not like done to yourself"; "a man with ''ren'', desiring to establish himself, helps others establish themselves; desiring to succeed himself, helps others to succeed" (''Analects'' 12.2; 6.28).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; He taught that the ability of people to imagine and project themselves into the places of others was a crucial quality for the pursuit of moral self-cultivation (''Analects'' 4.15; see also 5.12; 6.30; 15.24).&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland 34&lt;/ref&gt; Confucius regarded the exercise of [[Filial piety|devotion to one's parents]] and older siblings as the simplest, most basic way to cultivate ''ren''. (''Analects'' 1.2).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;

Confucius believed that ''ren'' could best be cultivated by those who had already learned self-discipline, and that self-discipline was best learned by practicing and cultivating one's understanding of [[Li (Confucian)|''li'']]: rituals and forms of propriety through which people demonstrate their respect for others and their responsible roles in society (''Analects'' 3.3). Confucius said that one's understanding of ''li'' should inform everything that one says and does (''Analects'' 12.1). He believed that subjecting oneself to ''li'' did not mean suppressing one's desires, but learning to reconcile them with the needs of one's family and broader community. By leading individuals to express their desires within the context of social responsibility, Confucius and his followers taught that the public cultivation of ''li'' was the basis of a well-ordered society (''Analects'' 2.3).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt; Confucius taught his students that an important aspect of ''li'' was observing the practical social differences that exist between people in daily life. In [[Confucianism|Confucian philosophy]] these "five relationships" include: ruler to ruled; father to son; husband to wife; elder brother to younger brother; and friend to friend.

''Ren'' and ''li'' have a special relationship in the ''Analects'': ''li'' manages one's relationship with one's family and close community, while ''ren'' is practiced broadly and informs one's interactions with all people. Confucius did not believe that ethical self-cultivation meant unquestioned loyalty to an evil ruler. He argued that the demands of ''ren'' and ''li'' meant that rulers could oppress their subjects only at their own peril: "You may rob the Three Armies of their commander, but you cannot deprive the humblest peasant of his opinion" (''Analects'' 9.26). Confucius said that a morally well-cultivated individual would regard his devotion to loving others as a mission for which he would be willing to die (''Analects'' 15.8).&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;

===Political philosophy===
Confucius's political beliefs were rooted in his belief that a good ruler would be self-disciplined, would govern his subjects through education and by his own example, and would seek to correct his subjects with love and concern rather than punishment and coercion. "If the people be led by laws, and uniformity among them be sought by punishments, they will try to escape punishment and have no sense of shame. If they are led by virtue, and uniformity sought among them through the practice of ritual propriety, they will possess a sense of shame and come to you of their own accord" (''Analects'' 2.3; see also 13.6). Confucius's political theories were directly contradictory to the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalistic]] political orientations of China's rulers, and he failed to popularize his ideals among China's leaders within his own lifetime.&lt;ref name="r3"&gt;Riegel "3. Confucius' Political Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Confucius believed that the social chaos of his time was largely due to China's ruling elite aspiring to, and claiming, titles of which they were unworthy. When the ruler of the large state of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] asked Confucius about the principles of good government, Confucius responded: "Good government consists in the ruler being a ruler, the minister being a minister, the father being a father, and the son being a son" (''Analects'' 12.11). Confucius's analysis of the need to raise officials' behavior to reflect the way that they identify and describe themselves is known as the [[rectification of names]], and he stated that the rectification of names should be the first responsibility of a ruler upon taking office (''Analects'' 13.3). Confucius believed that, because the ruler was the model for all who were under him in society, the rectification of names had to begin with the ruler, and that afterwards others would change to imitate him (''Analects'' 12.19).&lt;ref name="r3" /&gt;

Confucius judged a good ruler by his possession of ''[[De (Chinese)|de]]'' ("virtue"): a sort of moral force that allows those in power to rule and gain the loyalty of others without the need for physical coercion (''Analects'' 2.1). Confucius said that one of the most important ways that a ruler cultivates his sense of ''de'' is through a devotion to the correct practices of ''li''. Examples of rituals identified by Confucius as important to cultivate a ruler's ''de'' include: sacrificial rites held at ancestral temples to express thankfulness and humility; ceremonies of enfeoffment, toasting, and gift exchanges that bound nobility in complex hierarchical relationships of obligation and indebtedness; and, acts of formal politeness and decorum (i.e. bowing and yielding) that identify the performers as morally well-cultivated.&lt;ref name="r3" /&gt;

===Education===
The importance of education and study is a fundamental theme of the ''Analects''. For Confucius, a good student respects and learns from the words and deeds of his teacher, and a good teacher is someone older who is familiar with the ways of the past and the practices of antiquity '''(''Analects'' 7.22)'''. Confucius emphasized the need to find balance between formal study and intuitive self-reflection '''(''Analects'' 2.15)'''. When teaching he is never cited in the ''Analects'' as lecturing at length about any subject, but instead challenges his students to discover the truth through [[Socratic method|asking direct questions]], citing passages from the classics, and using analogies '''(''Analects'' 7.8)'''.&lt;ref name="Riegel4"&gt;Riegel 4 "Confucius and Education"&lt;/ref&gt; He sometimes required his students to demonstrate their understanding of subjects by making intuitive conceptual leaps before accepting their understanding and discussing those subjects at greater levels of depth. '''(''Analects'' 3.8)'''&lt;ref&gt;Slingerland 19–20&lt;/ref&gt;

His primary goal in educating his students was to produce [[Junzi|ethically well-cultivated men]] who would carry themselves with gravity, speak correctly, and demonstrate consummate integrity in all things '''(''Analects'' 12.11; see also 13.3)'''. He was willing to teach anyone regardless of social class, as long as they were sincere, eager, and tireless to learn '''(''Analects'' 7.7; 15.38)'''. He is traditionally credited with teaching three thousand students, though only seventy are said to have mastered what he taught. He taught [[Six Arts|practical skills]], but regarded moral self-cultivation as his most important subject.&lt;ref name="Riegel4" /&gt;

===Chapters===
In China, the traditional titles given to each chapter are mostly an initial two or three [[incipit]]s. In some cases a title may indicate a central theme of a chapter, but it is inappropriate to regard a title as a description or generalization of the content of a chapter. Chapters in the ''Analects'' are grouped by individual themes, but the chapters are not arranged in a way as to carry a continuous stream of thoughts or ideas. The themes of adjacent chapters are completely unrelated to each other. Central themes recur repeatedly in different chapters, sometimes in exactly the same wording and sometimes with small variations.

Chapter 10 contains detailed descriptions of Confucius's behaviors in various daily activities. [[Voltaire]] and [[Ezra Pound]] believed that this chapter demonstrated how Confucius was a mere human. [[Simon Leys]], who recently translated the ''Analects'' into English and French, said that the book may have been the first in human history to describe the life of an individual, historic personage. [[Elias Canetti]] wrote: "Confucius's ''Analects'' is the oldest complete intellectual and spiritual portrait of a man. It strikes one as a modern book; everything it contains and indeed everything it lacks is important."&lt;ref&gt;Canetti 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Within these incipits a large number of passages in the Analects begin with the formulaic ''ziyue'', "The Master said," but without  punctuation marks in classical Chinese, this does not confirm whether what follows ''ziyue'' is direct quotation of actual sayings of Confucius, or simply to be understood as "the Master said that.." and the paraphrase of Confucius by the compilers of the Analects.&lt;ref&gt;Roger T. Ames ''The Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation'' 2010 p. 285 "A large number of passages in the Analects begin with the formulaic ziyue 子曰, "The Master said," but because there are no punctuation marks in classical Chinese, we must ask if whatever follows ziyue is a literal transcription of speech, or a paraphrase of it, or a method of transmitting ideas in a written language which existed in important ways independently of the spoken language."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anyeint''' ({{MYname|MY=အငြိမ့်|MLCTS=a ngrim.}}; {{IPA-my|ʔəɲḛiɴ|IPA}}; {{lang-my|အငြိမ့်}}; also spelt '''a-nyeint''') is a traditional [[Burma|Burmese]] entertainment form that combines [[dance]] with instrumental music, [[singing|song]], and [[Sketch comedy|comedy routines]], in theatrical performances.&lt;ref name="Seekins"&gt;Seekins, Donald M.

==Characters==

The lead singer and dancer in an ''anyeint'' performance is called the ''anyeint minthami'' ({{my|အငြိမ့်မင်းသမီး}}). Well-known film actresses and singers, including [[May Than Nu]] and [[Yadana Khin]], are often featured as lead ''anyeint'' actresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no440/t001.htm |title=Myanmar TV show inspires young generation of comedians |author=Zon Pann Pwint |date=13 October 2009 |work=Myanmar Times |accessdate=15 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107223808/http://www.mmtimes.com/no440/t001.htm |archivedate=7 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''anyeint minthami'' dances to instrumental music and singing either [[a cappella]] or to music are interspersed with comedic dialogue and [[slapstick]] performed by clowns. The result is a sequence of solo and group dances. The costumes of ''anyeint'' performers are identical to those worn by puppets in traditional [[marionette]] theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Falconer|first=John|author2=Luca Invernizzi Tettoni|title=Burmese design and architecture|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2000|pages=218|isbn=978-962-593-882-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although lead actresses were once the main focus of performances, the focus has now shifted to the comedic skits performed.

Slapstick comedians, known as ''lu shwin daw'' ({{my|လူရွှင်တော်}}) or ''lu pyet'' ({{my|လူပျက်}}, although this term is falling out of usage) provide entertainment while the ''minthami'' changes outfits.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Catherine|year=2000|title=Burmese Nights: the Pagoda Festival Pwe in the Age of Hollywood's ‘Titanic’|journal=New Theatre Quarterly|publisher=Cambridge University Press|volume=29|pages=227–248|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=3032132&amp;jid=NTQ&amp;volumeId=16&amp;issueId=03&amp;aid=3032124&amp;bodyId=&amp;membershipNumber=&amp;societyETOCSession=|doi=10.1017/s0266464x00013865}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zaganar]] and [[Kutho]] were successful comedians in early ''anyeint'' revival. In more recent times, well-known film actors and singers, such as [[Ye Lay]], [[Nay Toe]] and [[Htun Htun]], Kyaw Kyaw Bo, have featured as comedians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TuZXkWGceiY/TkmAeIrNDSI/AAAAAAAAB6c/YVqHAh0kSHY/s1600/LA-HninSi+Poster_Aug27.jpg|title=LA ရင်ခွင်သို့နှင်းဆီ အငြိမ့်သဘင်နှင့် စတိတ်ရှိုး ကြေညာ|accessdate=15 August 2011|language=Burmese}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedians typically dressed in checkered-patterned Taungshay-style ''[[longyi]]'' (sarongs) and wear loose coats, a development innovated by [[U Po Sein]], an influential 19th-century performer.&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

A small all-male music orchestra, led by the ''[[pattala]]'' (xylophone) music, accompanies the performance.&lt;ref name="diamondc"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Catherine|date=Spring 2009|title=A Delicate Balance: Negotiating Isolation and Globalization in the Burmese Performing Arts|journal=The Drama Review|volume=53|issue=1|pages=1054–2043|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/the_drama_review/v053/53.1.diamond.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Anyeint performances begin with a recitation and explanation of ancient verses, followed by a ''pari kamma'' ({{my|ပရိကမ္မ}}), a formal speech by troupe members to introduce themselves and thank the show's patron.&lt;ref name="diamondc"/&gt; Comedians then provide an introductory slapstick skit, before inviting the lead actress to the stage for a performance, during which they will provide improvised jokes and playful insults to the audience.&lt;ref name="diamondc"/&gt; At the end of the dance set, comedians direct jokes at the actress, who rebuts them and defends herself.&lt;ref name="diamondc"/&gt;

In the past, the anyeint performance was concluded with a verse play called ''zat kyi'' ({{my|ဇာတ်ကြီး}}), although this portion is now omitted from contemporary anyeint programmes.&lt;ref name="diamond"/&gt;

==Origins==

The name "anyeint" comes from a [[Burmese language]] word meaning "gentle". The form originated as a royal court dance performed by female dancers and was originally confined to the royal court.&lt;ref name="Seekins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="diamondc"/&gt; However, after the end of the Konbaung dynasty in 1885, anyeint troupes were forced to seek work outside and popularized a hybrid dance and comedic performance that has become popular throughout Burma,&lt;ref name="Seekins" /&gt; especially appealing to the growing [[merchant]] class in [[British Burma]], who patronised and sponsored these performances.&lt;ref name="diamondc"/&gt;  The first known anyeint troupe was formed in [[Mandalay]] around 1900, by comedian U Chit Phwe and his wife, dancer Ma Sein Thone.&lt;ref name="diamondc"/&gt;

In the colonial era, famous anyeint actresses often became recording artists and were the headlines of anyeint shows, as composers wrote individual songs and dances suited to them.&lt;ref name="diamondc"/&gt; However, the importance of the lead actress has diminished.&lt;ref name="diamondc"/&gt; Anyeint reached its height in the 1970s, during a period of [[Burmese Way to Socialism|socialist rule]], with one of the most influential troupes being [[Mandalay]]'s ''Lamin Taya'' (The Hundred Moon Troupe).&lt;ref name="diamondc"/&gt; In 1973, the troupe's scriptwriter, Maung Myat Hmaing wrote ''Dancer of the Ganges'', which was one of the first Burmese plays to include the concept of democracy.&lt;ref name="diamondc"/&gt;

During the [[British Burma|colonial]], [[U Nu]] and [[Ne Win]] administrations, troupes commonly included political satire and critiques, including social commentary, as part of their skits.&lt;ref name="Seekins" /&gt; However, since 1988, regulations have become stricter, with comedians who perform political satire subject to arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guyot|first=James F.|date=Feb 1997|title=Burma in 1996: One Economy, Two Polities|journal=Asian Survey|publisher=University of California Press|volume=37|issue=2|pages=192|jstor=2645487|doi=10.1525/as.1997.37.2.01p0220s}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1988 to 1992, a military curfew at night prohibited all-night anyeint performances.&lt;ref name="diamondc"/&gt;

Since the release of the ''anyeint'' play ''Hninzi Thakhin'' ({{my|နှင်းဆီသခင်}}, lit. "Rose Master") in 2010, censorship of play contents have become stricter; the Myanmar Motion Picture Enterprise, the censorship body that regulates all ''anyeint'' troupes in the country, now mandates a full dress rehearsal to audit for any questionable content (such as jokes targeted at government officials, or cross-dressing scenes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/5583-censorship-target-burmese-traditional-dance-troupes.html|title=Censorship target: Burmese traditional dance troupes|last=Phanida|date=12 July 2011|work=Mizzima News|accessdate=13 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110712225351/http://mizzima.com/news/inside-burma/5583-censorship-target-burmese-traditional-dance-troupes.html| archivedate= 12 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Burmese comedian, [[Zarganar]], has frequently performed in anyeint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moemaka.org/index.php?view=article&amp;catid=81:news&amp;id=263:thee-lay-thee-a-colorful-anyeint-burmese-performance-troupe-a-success-in-san-francisco&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=44 Thee Lay Thee &amp; Colorful Anyeint, Burmese Performance Troupe, a success in San Francisco], [http://www.moemaka.org/ MoeMaKa], February 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1986, he formed the Mya Ponnama Anyeint troupe, whose performances have appeared on television. The Burmese performance art [[Htein Lin]] has also performed anyeint, which is an influence in his [[performance art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freezarganar.org/Htein-Lin.asp Htein Lin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430181701/http://www.freezarganar.org/Htein-Lin.asp |date=2010-04-30 }}, [http://www.freezarganar.org/ Free Zarganar].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canada House''' ({{lang-fr|Maison du Canada}}) is a [[Greek Revival]] building on [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]]. It has been a Grade II* [[Listed Building]] since 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{National Heritage List for England |num=1217724 |desc=Canada House (including the former Royal College of Physicians)|accessdate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has served as the offices of the [[High Commission of Canada in the United Kingdom]] since 1925.

== History ==
The building which would later become known as Canada House was built between 1824 and 1827 to designs by Sir [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]], the architect of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/major-contest-launched-for-overhaul-of-londons-canada-house/8644294.article Major contest launched for overhaul of London's Canada House] Architects Journal, 15 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally two buildings used by the [[Union Club (UK)|Union Club]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. Under the leadership of High Commissioner [[Peter Charles Larkin]] the [[Canadian government]] acquired the Union Club in 1923 for the sum of £223,000.&lt;ref name=canada&gt;[http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/united_kingdom-royaume_uni/offices-bureaux/house-maison.aspx?lang=eng Canada House – the Government of Canada's showpiece for close to a century] Canada International&lt;/ref&gt; It was Larkin's intention to centralise the work of 200 Canadian employees scattered among offices in Victoria Street in one central building. Renovations cost $1.3 million CDN and were supervised by the architect [[Septimus Warwick]], who moved the main entrance from Trafalgar Square to Cockspur Street. The designers imported Canadian furniture, carpets and maple and birch flooring. The exterior was reclad in [[Portland stone]] to match the facade of the Royal College of Physicians. The building was officially opened on 29 June 1925 by King [[George V]].&lt;ref name=canada/&gt;

When he declared Canada House open, King George said: "Canada is a great country: alike in the literal sense of vast extent from 'sea to sea' and great in achievement and in promise: and it is right and necessary that its official representatives here should be housed in a manner worthy of the Dominion and adequate to the discharge of their ever-growing and important duties."&lt;ref&gt;[http://crht.ca/king-george-v-1910-1936/ King George V, 1910–1936]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[London Blitz]], a bomb fell near the building, only {{convert|20|yd}} away from future Canadian prime minister [[Lester B. Pearson]], who was the secretary to the High Commissioner at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.gc.ca/history-histoire/assets/images/11-Canada_House_LR.jpg Canada House, circa 1941, after the [[London Blitz]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Canada increased its presence by acquiring the future [[Macdonald House (London)|Macdonald House]], located at 1 Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/good-riddance-to-grosvenor-square-canada-house-is-our-real-home/article15676855/ Good riddance to Grosvenor Square: Canada House is our real home]  The Globe and Mail, 29 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Canada House was closed by the Canadian government as a cost-cutting measure with the intention of selling it. A [[Canadian federal election, 1993|change of government]] in Canada saw this decision reversed and renovations were planned instead, beginning in 1997. The building was officially reopened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]], as [[Monarchy of Canada|Queen of Canada]], in May 1998. To commemorate the reopening, a detachment from the 3rd Battalion, [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]], came to London and mounted the [[Queen's Guard]] at Buckingham Palace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royal.gov.uk/royaleventsandceremonies/changingtheguard/overview.aspx Changing the Guard]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ontario Room.jpg|thumb|The Ontario Room, Canada House]]
Canada House was closed again in 2010 and re-opened in 2012 for the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond Jubilee]]. It was used as Canada Olympic House during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London. The main work of the High Commission, including consular, public affairs, political, trade and administrative functions was then carried out from [[Macdonald House (London)|Macdonald House]] in [[Mayfair]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/united_kingdom-royaume_uni/consular_services_consulaires/index.aspx?lang=eng&amp;menu_id=22 Passport and Services]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013 the Government of Canada announced that it would consolidate its diplomatic presence at Canada House and sell off Macdonald House.  As part of the plan the building next door to Canada House, known as 2-4 Cockspur Street, was acquired by Canada in 2013 (until this date 2-4 Cockspur Street served as headquarters of the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w4mp.org/dcms-is-moving/|title=DCMS is moving|publisher=|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building at 2-4 Cockspur Street was constructed between 1926-29 for Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada and had served as the Canadian Army's overseas headquarters in London during World War II. Over the next two years 2-4 Cockspur Street and Canada House were renovated. As part of the renovation, 2-4 Cockspur Street was joined to Canada House in July 2014.  In November 2013 Macdonald House was sold, although as part of the transaction the diplomatic staff were permitted to stay until the renovations to Canada House were completed and the diplomatic staff did not move to Canada House until December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/Canada+sells+diplomatic+mansion+Macdonald+House+London+Indian+developer+530M/9224845/story.html Canada.com – Canada sells diplomatic mansion Macdonald House in London to Indian developer for $530M]. Retrieved 29 Nov 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian High Commission transferred all of its diplomatic functions to Canada House on 15 December 2014. The Queen and the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]] once again officially reopened Canada House on 19 February 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/queen-elizabeth-ii-and-duke-of-edinburgh-officially-reopen-news-photo/463835544|title=Queen Elizabeth II and Duke of Edinburgh officially reopen Canada House|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current functions ==
Canada House is the home of the [[High Commission of Canada to the United Kingdom]]. It hosts consular facilities for Canadians to renew passports or apply for emergency assistance, visa and immigration processing services, a military liaison office, trade officers, political officers and a public affairs section. Canada House is used for special events, hosting conferences, receptions, lectures and lunches. The Canada House Gallery stages exhibitions of historical and contemporary art and artefacts.

{{British Royal Family}}

'''Charles, Prince of Wales''' (Charles Philip Arthur George; born 14 November 1948) is the [[heir apparent]] to the [[British throne]] as the eldest child of [[Queen Elizabeth II]]. He has been [[Duke of Cornwall]] and [[Duke of Rothesay]] since 1952, and is the oldest and longest-serving heir apparent in British history.&lt;ref name=apparent&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Charles becomes longest-serving heir apparent|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-13133587|publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=30 November 2011|date=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the longest-serving [[Prince of Wales]], having held that title since 1958.&lt;ref name=wales&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryan|first1=Nicola|title=Prince Charles is longest-serving Prince of Wales|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-41179772 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles was born at [[Buckingham Palace]] as the first grandchild of [[King George VI]] and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]]. He was educated at [[Cheam School|Cheam]] and [[Gordonstoun]] Schools, which his father, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], had attended as a child, as well as the [[Timbertop (Geelong Grammar School)|Timbertop]] campus of [[Geelong Grammar School]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. After earning a bachelor of arts degree from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], Charles served in the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Royal Navy]] from 1971 to 1976.

In 1981, he married [[Lady Diana Spencer]] and they had two sons: [[Prince William]] (b. 1982)—later to become [[Duke of Cambridge]]—and [[Prince Harry]] (b. 1984)—later to become [[Duke of Sussex]]. In 1996, the couple divorced following well-publicised extramarital affairs by both parties. Diana was [[Death of Diana, Princess of Wales|killed in a car crash]] in Paris the following year. In 2005, Charles married long-time partner [[Camilla Parker Bowles]].

Charles founded [[The Prince's Trust]] in 1976, sponsors [[The Prince's Charities]], and is a patron, president and a member of over 400 other charities and organisations. As an [[environmentalist]], he raises awareness of [[organic farming]] and [[climate change]] which has earned him [[List of awards received by Charles, Prince of Wales|awards and recognition]] from environmental groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rourke|first=Matt|title=Prince Charles to receive environmental award in NYC|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-01-28-prince-charles_x.htm|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=28 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Alderson|first=Andrew|title=Prince Charles given 'friend of the forest' award|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/4990226/Prince-Charles-given-friend-of-the-forest-award.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=14 March 2009|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lange|first=Stefan|title=Prince Charles collects award in Germany|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8481379|accessdate=11 May 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Awards"&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Lifetime Achievement Award Winner – HRH The Prince of Wales|url=http://www.greenawards.com/about/lifetime_achievement_award/2012-winner|publisher=greenawards.com|accessdate=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His support for [[alternative medicine]], including [[homeopathy]], has been criticised by some in the medical community&lt;ref name=faseb_journal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weissmann|first1=Gerald|title=Homeopathy: Holmes, Hogwarts, and the Prince of Wales|journal=The FASEB Journal|date=September 2006|volume=20|issue=11|pages=1755–1758|doi=10.1096/fj.06-0901ufm|url=http://www.fasebj.org/content/20/11/1755.full|accessdate=28 November 2015|pmid=16940145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brady|first1=Brian|title=He's at it again: Prince Charles accused of lobbying Health Secretary over homeopathy|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/hes-at-it-again-prince-charles-accused-of-lobbying-health-secretary-over-homeopathy-8723145.html|accessdate=28 November 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his views on the role of architecture in society and the conservation of historic buildings has received considerable attention from British architects and design critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profession reacts to Prince Charles’ 10 design principles |url= https://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/profession-reacts-to-prince-charles-10-design-principles/8674432.article|accessdate=3 December 2018 |publisher=architectsjournal.co.uk|date=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Forgey |first1=Benjamin |title=Prince Charles, Architecture's Royal pain |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1990/02/22/prince-charles-architectures-royal-pain/a894629c-c0a4-41d5-be83-e4da62a9f90f/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.bf23386d75b6 |accessdate=3 December 2018 |publisher=The Washington Post |date=22 February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Poundbury project became a model for innovation |url=https://www.ft.com/content/94e6c310-3c8f-11e3-a8c4-00144feab7de |accessdate=12 July 2018 |publisher=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1993, Charles has worked on the creation of [[Poundbury]], an experimental [[new town]] based on his preferences. He is also an author and co-author of a [[Charles, Prince of Wales, bibliography|number of books]].

==Early life and education==

Charles was born at Buckingham Palace in London during the reign of his maternal grandfather [[George VI]] on 14 November 1948, at 9:14&amp;nbsp;pm (GMT),&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=38455 |date=15 November 1948 |page=6003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Brandreth|p=120|2007}} the first child of [[Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh]], and [[Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], and first grandchild of King George VI and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]]. He was baptised in the palace's Music Room by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Geoffrey Fisher]], on 15 December 1948.{{refn|group="fn"|Prince Charles's godparents were: [[George VI|the King]] (his maternal grandfather); the [[Haakon VII of Norway|King of Norway]] (his cousin, for whom the [[Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone|Earl of Athlone]] stood proxy); [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] (his maternal great-grandmother); [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Princess Margaret]] (his maternal aunt); [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark]] (his paternal great-uncle, for whom the Duke of Edinburgh stood proxy); the [[Princess Victoria of Hesse and the Rhine|Dowager Marchioness of Milford Haven]] (his paternal great-grandmother); the [[Patricia Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Lady Brabourne]] (his cousin); and the Hon [[David Bowes-Lyon]] (his maternal great-uncle).&lt;ref name="Yvonne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.uniserve.com/~canyon/christenings.htm#Christenings |title=Yvonne's Royalty Home Page – Royal Christenings |publisher=Users.uniserve.com |accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Elizabeth, Philip, Charles and Anne.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Charles with his parents and sister in October 1957]]
The death of his grandfather and the accession of his mother as Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 made Charles her [[heir apparent]]. As the monarch's eldest son, he automatically took the titles [[Duke of Cornwall]], [[Duke of Rothesay]], [[Earl of Carrick]], [[Baron of Renfrew (title)|Baron of Renfrew]], [[Lord of the Isles]] and [[Prince and Great Steward of Scotland]].{{sfn|Brandreth|p=127|2007}} Charles attended [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|his mother's coronation]] at [[Westminster Abbey]] on 2 June 1953. As was customary for upper-class children at the time, a [[governess]], Catherine Peebles, was appointed and undertook his education between the ages of five and eight. Buckingham Palace announced in 1955 that Charles would attend school rather than have a private tutor, making him the first heir apparent ever to be educated in that manner.&lt;ref name="time 1988"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Growing Up Royal |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=25 April 1988 |url=http://www.time.com/time/daily/special/diana/readingroom/8191/4_25.html |accessdate=4 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050331004503/http://www.time.com/time/daily/special/diana/readingroom/8191/4_25.html |archivedate=31 March 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles attended [[Hill House School]] in west London. He did not receive preferential treatment from the school's founder and then-head, [[Stuart Townend (headmaster)|Stuart Townend]], who advised the Queen to have Charles train in [[Association football|football]] because the boys were never deferential to anyone on the football field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Lieutenant Colonel H.

It taught me to accept challenges and take the initiative." In a 1975 interview, he said he was "glad" he had attended Gordonstoun and that the "toughness of the place" was "much exaggerated".&lt;ref name="Colditz_kilts"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Colditz in kilts?

Upon his return to Gordonstoun, Charles emulated his father in becoming [[Head girl and head boy|Head Boy]]. He left in 1967, with six [[GCE Ordinary Level|GCE O-levels]] and two [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]] in history and French, at grades B and C respectively.&lt;ref name="powedu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/the-prince-of-wales/biography/education|title=The Prince of Wales&amp;nbsp;– Education|publisher=Prince of Wales|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Brandreth|p=145|2007}} On his early education, Charles later remarked, "I didn't enjoy school as much as I might have, but that was only because I'm happier at home than anywhere else."&lt;ref name="Colditz_kilts" /&gt; Charles broke royal tradition a second time when he proceeded straight to university after his A-levels, rather than joining the [[British Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="debrett"/&gt; In October 1967, he was admitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[Cambridge]], where he read [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], and history.{{sfn|Brandreth|p=151|2007}}&lt;ref name="powedu"/&gt; During his second year, Charles attended the [[Aberystwyth University|University College of Wales]] in [[Aberystwyth]], studying [[History of Wales|Welsh history]] and [[Welsh language|language]] for a term.&lt;ref name="powedu"/&gt; He graduated from Cambridge with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|2:2]] Bachelor of Arts on 23 June 1970, the first heir apparent to earn a university degree.&lt;ref name="powedu"/&gt; On 2 August 1975, he was awarded a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts degree from Cambridge]], in accordance with the university's practice.&lt;ref name="powedu"/&gt;

==Military training and career==
Charles followed family tradition when he served in the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[Royal Navy]]. During his second year at Cambridge, he requested and received Royal Air Force training. On 8 March 1971, he flew himself to the Royal Air Force College [[RAF Cranwell|Cranwell]] to train as a jet pilot.{{sfn|Brandreth|pp=169–170|2007}} After the passing-out parade that September, he embarked on a naval career and enrolled in a six-week course at the Royal Naval College Dartmouth. He then served on the guided missile destroyer {{HMS|Norfolk|D21|6}} (1971–1972) and the frigates {{HMS|Minerva|F45|6}} (1972–1973) and {{HMS|Jupiter|F60|6}} (1974). In 1974, he qualified as a helicopter pilot at [[RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron)|RNAS Yeovilton]], and then joined 845 Naval Air Squadron, operating from {{HMS|Hermes|R12|6}}.{{sfn|Brandreth|p=170|2007}}

On 9 February 1976, he took command of the coastal minehunter {{HMS|Bronington|M1115|6}} for his last ten months of active service in the navy.{{sfn|Brandreth|p=170|2007}} He learned to fly on a [[De Havilland Canada DHC-1 Chipmunk|Chipmunk]] basic pilot trainer, a [[BAC Jet Provost]] jet trainer, and a [[Beagle Basset]] multi-engine trainer; he then regularly flew the [[Hawker Siddeley Andover]], [[Westland Wessex]] and [[BAe 146]] aircraft of [[The Queen's Flight]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Military Career of the Prince of Wales|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/the-prince-of-wales/biography/military-career#na|publisher=Prince of Wales |accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; until he gave up flying after crashing the [[BAe 146]] in the [[Hebrides]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/wiki.php?id=187927|title=Incident British Aerospace BAe-146-100 ZE700, 29 Jun 1994|first=Harro|last=Ranter|website=aviation-safety.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/prince-gives-up-flying-royal-aircraft-after-hebrides-crash-1592247.html|title=Prince gives up flying royal aircraft after Hebrides crash|work=The Independent|author=Steve Boggan|date=19 July 1995|accessdate=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early romances==
[[File:HRH Prince Charles 43 Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|
Portrait of the Prince in [[Buckingham Palace]], 1974, by [[Allan Warren]]]]
In his youth, Charles was amorously linked to a number of women. His great-uncle [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] advised him:&lt;blockquote&gt;In a case like yours, the man should sow his wild oats and have as many affairs as he can before settling down, but for a wife he should choose a suitable, attractive, and sweet-charactered girl before she has met anyone else she might fall for&amp;nbsp;... It is disturbing for women to have experiences if they have to remain on a pedestal after marriage.{{sfn|Junor|p=72|2005}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Charles's girlfriends included Georgiana Russell, the daughter of the [[John Russell (diplomat)|British Ambassador to Spain]];{{sfn|Brandreth|p=192|2007}} Lady Jane Wellesley, the daughter of the [[8th Duke of Wellington]];{{sfn|Brandreth|p=193|2007}} Davina Sheffield;{{sfn|Brandreth|p=194|2007}} [[Lady Sarah Spencer]];{{sfn|Brandreth|p=195|2007}} and [[Camilla Shand]],{{sfn|Brandreth|p=178|2007}} who later became his second wife and Duchess of Cornwall.{{sfn|Brandreth|pp=15–17|2007}}

Early in 1974, Mountbatten began corresponding with Charles about a potential marriage to [[Amanda Knatchbull]], who was Mountbatten's granddaughter.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=204–206|1994}}{{sfn|Brandreth|p=200|2007}} Charles wrote to Amanda's mother—[[Patricia Knatchbull, 2nd Countess Mountbatten of Burma|Lady Brabourne]], who was also his [[Godparent|godmother]]—expressing interest in her daughter, to which she replied approvingly, though she suggested that a [[courtship]] with the not yet 17-year-old girl was premature.{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=263|1994}} Four years later, Mountbatten arranged for Amanda and himself to accompany Charles on his 1980 tour of India. Both fathers, however, objected; Philip feared that Charles would be eclipsed by his famous uncle (who had served as the last British [[Viceroy]] and first [[Governor-General of India]]), while [[John Knatchbull, 7th Baron Brabourne|Lord Brabourne]] warned that a joint visit would concentrate media attention on the cousins before they could decide on becoming a couple.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=263–265|1994}} However, in August 1979, before Charles would depart alone for India, Mountbatten was killed by the IRA. When Charles returned, he proposed to Amanda,&lt;!--Brandreth p 202 says Charles proposed two weeks before the assassination and that Amanda turned him down then, before Mountbatten's death--&gt; but in addition to her grandfather, she had lost her paternal grandmother and youngest brother [[Nicholas Knatchbull|Nicholas]] in the bomb attack and was now reluctant to join the royal family.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=263–265|1994}} In June 1980, Charles officially turned down [[Chevening]] House, placed at his disposal since 1974, as his future residence. Chevening, a [[stately home]] in Kent, was bequeathed, along with an [[financial endowment|endowment]], to the Crown by the last [[James Stanhope, 7th Earl Stanhope|Earl Stanhope]], Amanda's childless great-uncle, in the hope that Charles would eventually occupy it.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=299–300|1994}} In 1977, a newspaper report mistakenly announced his engagement to [[Princess Marie-Astrid of Luxembourg]].{{sfn|Brandreth|p=196|2007}}

==Marriages==
===Marriage to Lady Diana Spencer===
{{Main|Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer}}
[[File:Charles and Di. Uluru. March 83.JPG|thumb|The Prince and Princess of Wales visit [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock), Australia, March 1983]]
Charles first met [[Lady Diana Spencer]] in 1977 while he was visiting her home, [[Althorp]]. He was the companion of her elder sister, [[Lady Sarah McCorquodale|Sarah]], and did not consider Diana romantically until mid-1980. While they were sitting together on a bale of hay at a friend's barbecue in July, he mentioned Mountbatten's death, to which Diana replied that Charles had looked forlorn and in need of care during his uncle's funeral. Soon, according to Charles's chosen biographer, [[Jonathan Dimbleby]], "without any apparent surge in feeling, he began to think seriously of her as a potential bride", and she accompanied Charles on visits to [[Balmoral Castle]] and [[Sandringham House]].{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=279|1994}}

Charles's cousin [[Norton Knatchbull, 8th Baron Brabourne|Norton Knatchbull]] and his wife told Charles that Diana appeared awestruck by his position and that he did not seem to be in love with her.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=280–282|1994}} Meanwhile, the couple's continuing courtship attracted intense attention from the press and [[paparazzi]]. When Prince Philip told him that the media speculation would injure Diana's reputation if Charles did not come to a decision about marrying her soon, and realising that she was a suitable royal bride (according to Mountbatten's criteria), Charles construed his father's advice as a warning to proceed without further delay.{{sfn|Dimbleby|pp=281–283|1994}}

Prince Charles proposed to Diana in February 1981; she accepted and they married in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] on 29 July of that year. Upon his marriage, Charles reduced his voluntary tax contribution from the profits generated by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] from 50% to 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=[[New Statesman]] |location=UK | date=13 July 2009 | title=Royally Minted: What we give them and how they spend it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple lived at [[Kensington Palace]] and at [[Highgrove House]], near [[Tetbury]], and had two children: Princes [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|William]] (b. 1982) and [[Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex|Henry]] (known as "Harry") (b. 1984). Charles set a precedent by being the first royal father to be present at his children's births.&lt;ref name="time 1988"/&gt;

====Separation and divorce====
Within five years, the marriage was in trouble due to the couple's incompatibility and near thirteen-year age difference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Tina|title=The Diana Chronicles|year=2007|page=720}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Smith|p=561|2000}} Charles resumed his relationship with his former girlfriend Camilla Parker Bowles, and Diana began one with Major [[James Hewitt]], the family's former riding instructor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Princess Diana’s Former Lover Maintains He Is Not Prince Harry’s Father |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/03/james-hewitt-prince-harry-father-princess-diana |accessdate=25 November 2018 |publisher=Vanity fair |date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their evident discomfort in each other's company led to them being dubbed "The Glums" by the press.&lt;ref name="Quest"&gt;Quest, Richard (3 June 2002).

In December 1992, British Prime Minister [[John Major]] announced the couple's formal separation in Parliament. Earlier that year, the British press had published transcripts of a passionate bugged telephone conversation between Charles and Camilla from 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textfiles.com/phreak/camilla.txt "The Camillagate Tapes"], 18 December 1989, phone transcript, Phone Phreaking&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5258604.stm|title=Royals caught out by interceptions|date=29 November 2006|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Charles sought public understanding via a televised interview with [[Jonathan Dimbleby]] on 29 June 1994.

===Marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles===
{{Main|Wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles}}

The engagement of Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles was announced on 10 February 2005; he presented her with an engagement ring that had belonged to [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|his grandmother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wickell|first=Carly|title=Camilla's Engagement Ring|url=http://jewelry.about.com/od/engagementrings/a/camilla_ring.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=22 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110233046/http://jewelry.about.com/od/engagementrings/a/camilla_ring.htm|archivedate=10 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen's consent to the marriage (as required by the [[Royal Marriages Act 1772]]) was recorded in a [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] meeting on 2 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page496.asp |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20101103140224/http://www.privy-council.org.uk/output/Page496.asp |dead-url=yes |archive-date=3 November 2010 |title=Order in Council, 2 March 2005 |publisher=Privy-council.org.uk |accessdate=20 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the [[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]] announced its decision that the [[Queen's Privy Council for Canada]] was not required to meet to give its consent to the marriage, as the union would not result in offspring and would have no impact on the succession to the [[Monarchy of Canada|Canadian throne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Valpy |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Valpy |title=Scholars scurry to find implications of royal wedding |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=2 November 2005 |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=https://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2FTPStory%2FLAC%2F20050211%2FPROTOCOL11%2FTPInternational&amp;ord=5357017&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true |accessdate=4 March 2009 |location=Toronto }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles was the only member of the Royal Family to have a civil rather than a church wedding in England. Government documents from the 1950s and 1960s, published by the BBC, stated that such a marriage was illegal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/4262943.stm |title=Possible bar to wedding uncovered |publisher=BBC News |date=14 February 2005 |accessdate=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; though these were dismissed by Charles's spokesman,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/panorama/4262963.stm | title=Panorama Lawful impediment? |publisher=BBC News |date=14 February 2005 |accessdate=25 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and explained to be obsolete by the sitting government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200405/ldhansrd/vo050224/text/50224-51.htm#50224-51_head0 |title=Royal Marriage; Lords Hansard Written Statements 24 Feb 2005 : Column WS87 (50224-51) |author=The Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor (Lord Falconer of Thoroton) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=24 February 2005 |accessdate=12 October 2008}} Excerpt: "The Government are satisfied that it is lawful for the Prince of Wales and Mrs Parker Bowles, like anyone else, to marry by a civil ceremony in accordance with Part III of the Marriage Act 1949. ¶ Civil marriages were introduced in England, by the Marriage Act 1836. Section 45 said that the Act&amp;nbsp;... shall not extend to the marriage of any of the Royal Family". ¶ But the provisions on civil marriage in the 1836 Act were repealed by the Marriage Act 1949. All remaining parts of the 1836 Act, including Section 45, were repealed by the Registration Service Act 1953. No part of the 1836 Act, therefore, remains on the statute book."&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage was scheduled to take place in a civil ceremony at [[Windsor Castle]], with a subsequent religious blessing at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor|St George's Chapel]]. The venue was subsequently changed to [[Windsor Guildhall]], because a civil marriage at Windsor Castle would oblige the venue to be available to anyone who wished to be married there. Four days before the wedding, the originally scheduled date of 8 April was postponed until the following day in order to allow Charles and some of the invited dignitaries to attend the [[funeral of Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope funeral delays royal wedding|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4409507.stm|accessdate=22 August 2013|date=4 April 2005|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles's parents did not attend the civil marriage ceremony; the Queen's reluctance to attend probably arose from her position as [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4289417.stm |title=Q&amp;A: Queen's wedding decision |publisher=BBC News |date=23 February 2005 |accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh did attend the [[service of worship|service]] of [[blessing]] and later held a reception for the newlyweds at Windsor Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/04/09/world/main686994.shtml |title=Charles And Camilla Finally Wed, After 30 Years Of Waiting, Prince Charles Weds His True Love|publisher= CBS News |date= 9 April 2005|accessdate=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blessing, by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]], at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], was televised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Oliver|first=Mark|title=Charles and Camilla wed|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/apr/09/monarchy.markoliver|accessdate=22 August 2013|date=9 April 2005|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social interests==
===Philanthropy and charity===

Since founding [[The Prince's Trust]] in 1976, Charles has established sixteen more charitable organisations, and now serves as president of all of those.&lt;ref name="Charities"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prince's Charities|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/atwork/theprincescharities/|publisher=Prince of Wales |accessdate=16 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, these form a loose alliance called [[The Prince's Charities]], which describes itself as "the largest multi-cause charitable enterprise in the United Kingdom, raising over £100 million annually&amp;nbsp;... [and is] active across a broad range of areas including education and young people, environmental sustainability, the built environment, responsible business and enterprise and international."&lt;ref name="Charities"/&gt;

In 2010, [[The Prince's Charities#The Prince's Charities Canada|The Prince's Charities Canada]] was established in a similar fashion to its namesake in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/prince-charles-rallies-top-level-support-for-his-canadian-causes/article2437881/| last=Mackreal| first=Kim| title=Prince Charles rallies top level support for his Canadian causes| date=18 May 2012| newspaper=The Globe and Mail| accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles is also [[patron]] of over 350 other charities and organisations,&lt;ref name=patron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/personalprofiles/theprinceofwales/patronages/index.html |title=Patronages |publisher=Prince of Wales |accessdate=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and carries out duties related to these throughout the [[Commonwealth realm]]s; for example, he uses [[Royal tours of Canada|his tours]] of Canada as a way to help draw attention to youth, the disabled, the environment, the arts, medicine, the elderly, heritage conservation, and education.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/biography.htm |title=Royal Visit 2001 |publisher=Canadianheritage.gc.ca |accessdate=12 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922153922/http://www.canadianheritage.gc.ca/special/royalvisit/biography.htm |archivedate=22 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, Charles has supported humanitarian projects. Along with his two sons, he took part in ceremonies that marked the 1998 [[International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; Charles has also set up [[The Prince's Charities#The Prince's Charities Canada|The Prince's Charities Australia]], which is based in [[Melbourne, Victoria]].

Charles was one of the first world leaders to express strong concerns about the human rights record of Romanian dictator [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], initiating objections in the international arena,{{sfn|Dimbleby|p=250|1994}} and subsequently supported the FARA Foundation,&lt;ref name=patron/&gt; a charity for Romanian orphans and abandoned children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faracharity.org/ |title=FARA Charity |publisher=FARA Enterprises |accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2013, Charles donated an unspecified sum of money to the British Red Cross Syria Crisis appeal and DEC Syria appeal, which is run by 14 British charities to help victims of the [[Syrian civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Charles makes 'generous' Syria donation|url=http://www.thecommentator.com/article/3077/prince_charles_makes_generous_syria_donation|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=thecommentator.com|date=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Charles makes 'generous' Syria donation |url=http://www.turknewsline.com/prince-charles-makes-generous-syria-donation/ |accessdate=19 April 2013 |newspaper=www.turknewsline.com/ |date=28 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502033337/http://www.turknewsline.com/prince-charles-makes-generous-syria-donation/ |archivedate=2 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', It is believed that after turning 65 years old in 2013, Charles donated his state pension to an unnamed charity that supports elderly people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Addley|first1=Esther|title=Prince Charles to claim state pension – and donate it to charity|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/07/prince-charles-claim-state-pension-navy-donate-charity|accessdate=27 July 2014|work=The Guardian|date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, Charles arranged for five million measles-rubella vaccinations for children in the [[Philippines]] on the outbreak of measles in South-East Asia. According to Clarence House, Charles was affected by news of the damage caused by [[Typhoon Yolanda]] in 2013.

===Built environment===
The Prince of Wales has openly expressed his views on architecture and [[urban planning]]; he fostered the advancement of [[New Classical Architecture]] and asserted that he "care[s] deeply about issues such as the environment, architecture, inner-city renewal, and the quality of life."&lt;ref name="planetizen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles, Prince of Wales|url=http://www.planetizen.com/topthinkers/charles|publisher=Planetizen|date=13 September 2009|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Charles' 60th|url=http://www.plannedseniorhood.com/index.php/prince-charles-60th|work=10 interesting facts about Prince Charles|publisher=Planned Seniorhood|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech given for the 150th anniversary of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) on 30 May 1984, he memorably described a proposed extension to the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery in London]] as a "monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved friend" and deplored the "glass stumps and concrete towers" of modern architecture.&lt;ref name="RIBA speech"&gt;[http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html Text of the Prince of Wales's speech at the 150th anniversary of the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213205/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/speechesandarticles/a_speech_by_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_at_the_150th_anniversary_1876801621.html |date=27 September 2007 }} Royal Gala Evening at Hampton Court Palace, 30 May 1984.

[[File:Prince Charles 2000.jpg|thumb|The Prince of Wales at the newly opened [[We The Curious|@Bristol]], 14 June 2000]]

His book and BBC documentary ''A Vision of Britain'' (1987) was also critical of modern architecture, and he has continued to campaign for traditional urbanism, human scale, restoration of historic buildings, and sustainable design,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Prince of Wales Accepts Vincent Scully Prize|url=http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=15419&amp;int_modo=1|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=artdaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite criticism in the press. Two of his charities ([[The Prince's Regeneration Trust]] and [[The Prince's Foundation for Building Community]]) promote his views, and the village of [[Poundbury]] was built on land owned by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]] to a master plan by [[Léon Krier]] under the guidance of Prince Charles and in line with his philosophy.&lt;ref name="planetizen"/&gt;

Charles helped establish a national trust for the built environment in Canada after lamenting, in 1996, the unbridled destruction of many of the country's historic urban cores. He offered his assistance to the [[Department of Canadian Heritage]] in creating a trust modelled on Britain's [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], a plan that was implemented with the passage of the [[2007 Canadian federal budget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.budget.gc.ca/2007/pdf/bp2007e.pdf| last=Department of Finance| title=The Budget Plan 2007: Aspire to a Stronger, Safer, Better Canada| pages=99| date=19 March 2007| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the Prince agreed to the use of his title for the [[Prince of Wales Prize for Municipal Heritage Leadership]], awarded by the [[Heritage Canada]] Foundation to municipal governments that have shown sustained commitment to the conservation of historic places.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagecanada.org/eng/services/winners.html#pow |title=Heritage Services |publisher=Heritage Canada Foundation |accessdate=12 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914170352/http://www.heritagecanada.org/eng/services/winners.html |archivedate=14 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While visiting the United States and surveying the damage caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]], Charles received the [[National Building Museum]]'s [[Vincent Scully Prize]] in 2005, for his efforts in regard to architecture; he donated $25,000 of the prize money towards restoring storm-damaged communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hales|first=Linda|title=Prince Charles to Accept Scully Prize at Building Museum|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/25/AR2005102501514.html|accessdate=19 April 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=26 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prince of Wales Accepts Vincent Scully Prize|url=http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=15419&amp;int_modo=1 |publisher=artdaily.com|accessdate=19 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along similar lines, the Prince of Wales became involved with farming and various industries within it, regularly meeting with farmers to discuss their trade. Although the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|2001 foot-and-mouth]] epidemic in England prevented Charles from visiting organic farms in [[Saskatchewan]], he met the farmers at [[Assiniboia, Saskatchewan|Assiniboia]] town hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Charles charms Assiniboia|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-charles-charms-assiniboia-1.296732|accessdate=30 July 2014|publisher=CBC |date=27 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince helps 'suicidal' farmers|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/UK/03/15/charles.farms/index.html|accessdate=30 July 2014|publisher=CNN|date=15 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he founded the [[Mutton Renaissance Campaign]], which aims to support British sheep farmers and make [[mutton]] more attractive to Britons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.muttonrenaissance.org.uk/index.php |title=What is The Mutton Renaissance? |accessdate=22 September 2012 |publisher=[[Mutton Renaissance Campaign]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His organic farming has attracted media criticism: According to ''[[The Independent]]'' in October 2006, "the story of Duchy Originals has involved compromises and ethical blips, wedded to a determined merchandising programme."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/living/food_and_drink/features/article1816837.ece |title=Oatcakes at dawn: The truth about Duchy Originals |work=The Independent |location=London |accessdate=12 October 2008 |date=7 October 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015074838/http://independent.co.uk/living/food_and_drink/features/article1816837.ece |archivedate=15 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he received the 10th annual [[Global Environmental Citizen Award]] from the [[Harvard Medical School]]'s Center for Health and the Global Environment, the director of which, [[Eric Chivian]], stated: "For decades the Prince of Wales has been a champion of the natural world&amp;nbsp;...

In 2007, Charles launched [[The Prince's May Day Network]], which encourages businesses to take action on [[climate change]]. Speaking to the [[European Parliament]] on 14 February 2008, he called for European Union leadership in the war against climate change. During the standing ovation that followed, [[Nigel Farage]], the leader of the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]] (UKIP), remained seated and went on to describe Charles's advisers as "naive and foolish at best."&lt;ref&gt;Farage continued: "How can somebody like Prince Charles be allowed to come to the European Parliament at this time to announce he thinks it should have more powers? It would have been better for the country he wants to rule one day if he had stayed home and tried to persuade [[Gordon Brown]] to give the people the promised referendum [on the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]]." {{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7245183.stm |title=UKIP anger at prince's EU speech|date=14 February 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech to the Low Carbon Prosperity Summit in a European Parliament chamber on 9 February 2011, Charles said that climate change sceptics are playing "a reckless game of roulette" with the planet's future and are having a "corrosive effect" on public opinion. He also articulated the need to protect fisheries and the Amazon rain forest, and to make low-carbon emissions affordable and competitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apnews.myway.com//article/20110209/D9L9BNPO1.html |title=UK's Prince Charles blasts climate-change skeptics |publisher=Apnews.myway.com |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August 2012, the Prince of Wales addressed the International Union for Conservation of Nature – World Conservation Congress, supporting the view that grazing animals are needed to keep soils and grassland productive:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have been particularly fascinated, for example, by the work of a remarkable man called [[Allan Savory]], in [[Zimbabwe]] and other [[semi arid]] areas, who has argued for years against the prevailing expert view that is the simple numbers of cattle that drive overgrazing and cause fertile land to become desert. On the contrary, as he has since shown so graphically, the land needs the presence of feeding animals and their droppings for the cycle to be complete, so that soils and grassland areas stay productive. Such that, if you take grazers off the land and lock them away in vast [[feedlots]], the land dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Charles sends a message to IUCN's World Conservation Congress |url=http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774/Prince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature |accessdate=6 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315111928/http://www.iucn.org/knowledge/multimedia/video/?10774%2FPrince-Charles-sends-a-message-to-IUCNs-World-Conservation-Congress |archivedate=15 March 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In February 2014, Charles visited the [[Somerset levels]] to meet residents affected by [[Winter flooding of 2013–14 on the Somerset Levels|winter flooding]]. During his visit, Charles remarked that "There's nothing like a jolly good disaster to get people to start doing something. The tragedy is that nothing happened for so long."

In April 2008, ''[[The Times]]'' published a letter from [[Edzard Ernst]], Professor of Complementary Medicine at the University of Exeter, which asked the Prince's Foundation to recall two guides promoting alternative medicine, saying "the majority of alternative therapies appear to be clinically ineffective, and many are downright dangerous." A speaker for the foundation countered the criticism by stating: "We entirely reject the accusation that our online publication ''Complementary Healthcare: A Guide'' contains any misleading or inaccurate claims about the benefits of complementary therapies. On the contrary, it treats people as adults and takes a responsible approach by encouraging people to look at reliable sources of information&amp;nbsp;... so that they can make informed decisions.

The Prince's [[Waitrose Duchy Organic|Duchy Originals]] produce a variety of complementary medicinal products including a "Detox Tincture" that Edzard Ernst has denounced as "financially exploiting the vulnerable" and "outright [[quackery]]".&lt;ref name=TelegraphAltMed&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mandrake/6474595/Prince-Charles-lobbies-Andy-Burnham-on-complementary-medicine-for-NHS.html | date=31 October 2009|work=The Telegraph |location=UK |author=Walker, Tim |title=Prince Charles lobbies Andy Burnham on complementary medicine for NHS | accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] criticised an email that Duchy Originals had sent out to advertise its Echina-Relief, Hyperi-Lift and Detox Tinctures products saying that it was misleading.&lt;ref name=TelegraphAltMed/&gt; The Prince personally wrote at least seven letters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcscience.net/?p=89|title=HRH "meddling in politics"|date=12 March 2007|publisher=DC's Improbable Science|author=[[David Colquhoun|Colquhoun, David]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] (MHRA) shortly before they relaxed the rules governing labelling of such herbal products, a move that has been widely condemned by scientists and medical bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/doctors-attack-natural-remedy-claims-mchf8nkw22j |work=The Times |location=UK | date=1 September 2006 | title=Doctors attack natural remedy claims|author1=Nigel Hawkes |author2=Mark Henderson }} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2009, it was reported that Charles had personally lobbied the Health Secretary, [[Andy Burnham]], regarding greater provision of alternative treatments in the NHS.&lt;ref name=TelegraphAltMed/&gt; In 2016, Charles said in a speech that he used [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] veterinary medicines to reduce antibiotic use at his farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/12/prince-charles-use-homeopathy-in-animals-to-cut-antibiotic-use|title=Prince Charles: I use homeopathy in animals to cut antibiotic use|work=The Guardian|date=12 May 2016|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Ernst's book ''More Good Than Harm? The Moral Maze of Complementary and Alternative Medicine'' he and ethicist Kevin Smith call Charles "foolish and immoral" and "conclude that it is not possible to practice alternative medicine ethically". Ernst further claims that the private secretary of the Prince contacted the vice chancellor of Exeter University to investigate Ernst's complaints against the "Smallwood Report" which the Prince had commissioned in 2005.

The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall made their first joint trip to the [[Republic of Ireland]] in May 2015.

==Hobbies and personal interests==

===Sports===

From his youth until 1992, Prince Charles was an avid player of competitive [[polo]]. He continued to play informally, including for charity, until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4445424.stm | title = Prince Charles stops playing polo | date = 17 November 2005 |publisher=BBC News | accessdate =29 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles also frequently took part in [[fox hunting]] until [[Hunting Act 2004|the sport was banned in the United Kingdom]] in 2005. By the late 1990s, opposition to the activity was growing when Charles's participation was viewed as a "political statement" by those who were opposed to it. The [[League Against Cruel Sports]] launched an attack against Charles after he took his sons on the [[Duke of Beaufort's Hunt|Beaufort Hunt]] in 1999. At that time, the government was trying to ban hunting with hounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/496138.stm|title=Prince Charles takes sons hunting|date=30 October 1999|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=19 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1055062002|title=Prince: I'll leave Britain over fox hunt ban|date=22 September 2002|work=[[Scotland on Sunday]]|author=Jeremy Watson|accessdate=29 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120713090359/http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1055062002|archivedate=13 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles has been a keen salmon angler since youth and supports [[Orri Vigfússon]]'s efforts to protect the North Atlantic salmon. He frequently fishes the [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|River Dee]] in [[Aberdeenshire]], Scotland, while he claims his most special angling memories are from his time in [[Vopnafjörður]], Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;''A Celebration of Salmon Rivers: The World's Finest Atlantic Salmon Rivers''.

===Visual, performing and contemporary arts===
Prince Charles is president or patron of more than twenty performing arts organisations, which include the [[Royal College of Music]], the [[The Royal Opera|Royal Opera]], the [[English Chamber Orchestra]], the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]], [[Welsh National Opera]], and the [[Purcell School]]. In 2000, he revived the tradition of appointing harpists to the Royal Court, by appointing an [[Official Harpist to the Prince of Wales]]. As an undergraduate at Cambridge he played cello, and has sung with the [[Bach Choir]] twice.&lt;ref name=arts/&gt;
Charles founded [[The Prince's Foundation for Children and The Arts]] in 2002, to help more children experience the arts first-hand.

===Publications===
{{Main|Charles, Prince of Wales, bibliography}}
Prince Charles is an author of several books that reflect his own interests. He has also contributed a [[foreword]] or [[preface]] to books by other writers and has also written, presented and has been featured in documentary films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/418089|title=HRH the Prince of Wales : A Vision of Britain|publisher=BFI}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theharmonymovie.com/aboutfilm.php|title=Harmony Movie Website|publisher= The Harmony Movie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Prince and the Composer'', BBC Four.

==Media image==
Since his birth, Prince Charles has undergone close media attention, which increased as he matured. It has been an ambivalent relationship, largely impacted by his marriages to Diana and Camilla and its aftermath, but also centred on his future conduct as king, such as the 2014 play ''[[King Charles III (play)|King Charles III]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bartlett|first1=Mike|title=King Charles III|url=http://www.almeida.co.uk/event/kingcharles3|accessdate=27 July 2014|publisher=www.almeida.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of marriage to Diana===
[[File:Prince Charles, Princess Diana, Nancy Reagan, and Ronald Reagan (1985).jpg|thumb|The Prince and Princess of Wales with [[Nancy Reagan]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] in November 1985]]
Described as the "[[Eligible bachelor|world's most eligible bachelor]]" in the late 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Man who will be King|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19791001&amp;id=PSwpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6CoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4563,324963|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423003801/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19791001&amp;id=PSwpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6CoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4563,324963|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 April 2016|accessdate=30 July 2014|agency=Google news|publisher=The Milwaukee Journal|date=1 October 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Charles was subsequently overshadowed by Diana. After her death, the media regularly breached Charles's privacy and printed exposés.

In 2006, the prince filed a court case against the ''[[Daily Mail|Mail on Sunday]]'', after excerpts of his personal journals were published, revealing his opinions on matters such as the [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]] to China in 1997, in which Charles described the Chinese government officials as "appalling old waxworks".&lt;ref name=BBCjournals /&gt; [[Mark Bolland]], his ex-private secretary, declared in a statement to the High Court that Charles "would readily embrace the political aspects of any contentious issue he was interested in&amp;nbsp;... He carried it out in a very considered, thoughtful and researched way. He often referred to himself as a 'dissident' working against the prevailing political consensus."&lt;ref name=BBCjournals&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4734798.stm |title=Charles 'adopted dissident role' |publisher=BBC News |date=21 February 2006 |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Dimbleby]] reported that the prince "has accumulated a number of certainties about the state of the world and does not relish contradiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/prince-charles-ready-for-active-service-23g3jzg02jq|title=Prince Charles: Ready for active service|date= 16 November 2008|work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=29 March 2009 | first=Jonathan | last=Dimbleby}} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other people who were formerly connected with the prince have betrayed his confidence. An ex-member of his household handed the press an internal memo in which Charles commented on ambition and opportunity, and which was widely interpreted as blaming meritocracy for creating a combative atmosphere in society. Charles responded: "In my view, it is just as great an achievement to be a plumber or a bricklayer as it is to be a lawyer or a doctor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4035181.stm |title=The rise of the meritocracy |publisher=BBC News |first=Jonathan |last=Duffy |date=23 November 2004 |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction to press treatment===
Charles's anguish was recorded in his private comments to [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]], caught on a microphone during a press photo-call in 2005 and published in the national press. After a question from the [[BBC]]'s royal correspondent, [[Nicholas Witchell]], Charles muttered: "These bloody people. I can't bear that man. I mean, he's so awful, he really is."&lt;ref name="news1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4397667.stm|title=Transcript: Princes' comments|date=31 March 2005|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:20151104 OH H1013410 0003 (22461157447).jpg|thumb|Charles's ninth visit to [[New Zealand]] in 2015]]

In 2002, Charles, "so often a target of the press, got his chance to return fire" when addressing "scores of editors, publishers and other media executives" gathered at [[St Bride's Church|St Bride's Fleet Street]] to celebrate 300 years of journalism.&lt;ref&gt;London's first daily newspaper, the [[Daily Courant]], was published in 1702.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite web|last=Woods|first=Audrey|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2002/Prince-Charles-Addresses-Editors/id-92deb09f64410b55cdfc261db024282b |title=Prince Charles Addresses Editors |publisher=AP News Archive|date=11 March 2002|accessdate=17 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defending public servants from "the corrosive drip of constant criticism", he noted that the press had been "awkward, cantankerous, cynical, bloody-minded, at times intrusive, at times inaccurate and at times deeply unfair and harmful to individuals and to institutions."&lt;ref name="Woods"/&gt; But, he concluded, regarding his own relations with the press, "from time to time we are probably both a bit hard on each other, exaggerating the downsides and ignoring the good points in each."&lt;ref name="Woods"/&gt;

===Guest appearances on television===
The Prince of Wales has occasionally appeared on television. In 1984, he read his children's book ''[[The Old Man of Lochnagar]]'' for the BBC's ''[[Jackanory]]'' series.

His saving of the Scottish stately home [[Dumfries House]] was the subject of [[Alan Titchmarsh]]'s documentary ''Royal Restoration'', which aired on TV in May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/todays-top-tv/prince-charles-the-royal-restoration/49262 |title=Prince Charles: The Royal Restoration |publisher=What's on TV |date=29 May 2012 |accessdate=17 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123082814/http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/todays-top-tv/prince-charles-the-royal-restoration/49262 |archivedate=23 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in May 2012, Charles tried his hand at being a weather presenter for the BBC, reporting the forecast for Scotland as part of their annual week at [[Holyrood Palace]] alongside [[Christopher Blanchett]]. He injected humour in his report, asking, "Who the hell wrote this script?" as references were made to royal residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2012/may/10/prince-charles-weather-bbc-scotland-video |title=Prince Charles reads weather on BBC Scotland: 'Thank God it isn't a bank holiday!' |work=The Guardian|date=10 May 2012|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 2015, ''[[Channel 4 News]]'' revealed that interviews with Charles were subject to a contract that restricts questions to those previously approved, and gives his staff oversight of editing and the right to "remove the contribution in its entirety from the programme". ''Channel 4 News'' decided not to proceed with an interview on this basis, which some journalists believed would put them at risk of breaching the [[Ofcom]] Broadcasting Code on editorial independence and transparency.&lt;ref name="independent-20151202"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prince-charles-the-15-page-contract-that-reveals-how-the-prince-of-wales-tries-to-control-the-media-a6756541.html |title=Prince Charles: The 15-page contract that reveals how the Prince of Wales tries to control the media |author=Ian Burrell |newspaper=The Independent |date=2 December 2015 |accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residences and finance==
[[File:Clarence house.jpg|thumb|[[Clarence House]], the official residence of the Prince of Wales]]

[[Clarence House]] in London is Charles's official residence. Previously, he had an apartment at [[St James's Palace]]. Charles also has two private homes: [[Highgrove House]] in [[Gloucestershire]] and [[Birkhall]] near [[Balmoral Castle]]. Both Clarence House and Birkhall were previously the residences of [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clarence House |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/ClarenceHouse/History.aspx |publisher=/www.royal.gov.uk |accessdate=1 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502031801/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalResidences/ClarenceHouse/History.aspx |archivedate=2 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His primary source of income is generated from the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], which owns 133,658 acres of land (around 54,090 hectares), including farming, residential, and commercial properties, as well as an investment portfolio. Highgrove is owned by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], having been purchased for his use in 1980, and which Prince Charles rents for £336,000 per annum.&lt;ref&gt;"Living off the State: A Critical Guide to UK Royal Finance" Jon Temple, 2nd Edition, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Public Accounts Committee (United Kingdom)|Public Accounts Committee]] published its 25th report into the Duchy of Cornwall accounts in November 2013 noting that the duchy performed well in 2012–13, increasing its total income and producing an overall surplus of £19.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee publishes report on the Duchy of Cornwall accounts|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/news/duchy-of-cornwall-report/ |publisher=parliament.uk|date=5 November 2013|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the prince purchased a 192-acre property (150 acres of grazing and parkland, and 40 acres of woodland) in [[Carmarthenshire]], and applied for permission to convert the farm into a Welsh home for him and the Duchess of Cornwall, to be rented out as holiday flats when the couple is not in residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/welsh_property_for_the_duchy_of_cornwall_424937442.html |title=The Prince of Wales&amp;nbsp;– Welsh property for The Duchy of Cornwall |publisher=Prince of Wales |date=22 November 2006 |accessdate=2 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809060116/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/welsh_property_for_the_duchy_of_cornwall_424937442.html |archive-date=9 August 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A neighbouring family said the proposals flouted local planning regulations, and the application was put on hold temporarily while a report was drafted on how the alterations would affect the local bat population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_west/6727951.stm |title=Objection to prince's house plan |publisher=BBC News |date=7 June 2007 |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles and Camilla first stayed at the new property, called [[Llwynywermod]], in June 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title=The Prince of Wales and The Duchess of Cornwall inhabit Llwynywermod for first time| publisher=Clarence House| date=23 June 2008| url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/the_prince_of_wales_and_the_duchess_of_cornwall_inhabit_llwy_1566635938.html| accessdate=2 October 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809053130/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/the_prince_of_wales_and_the_duchess_of_cornwall_inhabit_llwy_1566635938.html| archive-date=9 August 2012| dead-url=yes| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titles and styles===
The Prince's full title is: ''His Royal Highness Prince Charles Philip Arthur George, Prince of Wales, KG, KT, GCB, OM, AK, QSO, PC, ADC, Earl of Chester, Duke of Cornwall, Duke of Rothesay, Earl of Carrick, Baron of Renfrew, Lord of the Isles and Prince and Great Steward of Scotland''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/the-prince-of-wales/titles-and-heraldry/titles|title=The Prince of Wales: Titles|accessdate=10 July 2017|date=n.d.|publisher=Clarence House}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/06/27/world/europe/prince-charles-fast-facts/index.html|title=Prince Charles Fast Facts|accessdate=10 July 2017|date=n.d.|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles has held titles throughout his life: the grandson of the monarch, the son of the monarch and in his own right. He has been a [[British prince]] since birth and was created Prince of Wales in 1958.{{refn|group="fn"|As the child of a daughter of the sovereign, Charles would not usually have been accorded the titles of a [[British prince]] or the [[Style (manner of address)|style]] ''[[Royal Highness]]''. However, on 22 October 1948, George VI had issued [[letters patent]] granting a royal and princely status to any children of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38452|page=5889|date=9 November 1948}}&lt;/ref&gt; making Charles a royal prince from birth.}} There has been speculation as to what [[regnal name]] the prince would choose upon his succession to the throne. If he uses his first name, he would be known as ''Charles III''. However, it was reported in 2005 that Charles has suggested he may choose to reign as ''George VII'' in honour of his [[George VI|maternal grandfather]], and to avoid association with the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (who was beheaded) and [[Charles II of England|Charles&amp;nbsp;II]] (who was known for his promiscuous lifestyle),&lt;ref name="CallMeGeorge"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/call-me-george-suggests-charles-xqqg2th2r23|title=Call me George, suggests Charles|last=Pierce|first=Andrew|date=24 December 2005|work=The Times|location=UK|subscription=yes|via=|accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to be sensitive to the memory of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]], who was called "Charles III" by [[Jacobitism|his supporters]].&lt;ref name="CallMeGeorge"/&gt; Charles's office responded that "no decision has been made".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/dec/27/monarchy.michaelwhite|work=The Guardian |location=UK | title=Charles denies planning to reign as King George | date=27 December 2005| accessdate=2 October 2012 | first=Michael | last=White}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honours and military appointments===
Charles has held substantive ranks in the armed forces of a number of countries since he was made a [[flight lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1972. Charles's first honorary appointment in the armed forces was as [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Royal Regiment of Wales]] in 1969; since then, the prince has also been installed as Colonel-in-Chief, Colonel, Honorary Air Commodore, [[Air Commodore-in-Chief]], Deputy Colonel-in-Chief, Royal Honorary Colonel, Royal Colonel, and Honorary Commodore of at least 32 military formations throughout the Commonwealth, including the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]], which is the only foreign regiment in the British army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prince of Wales visits the Royal Gurkha Rifles and Knole House|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/news-and-diary/the-prince-of-wales-visits-the-royal-gurkha-rifles-and-knole-house|publisher=Prince of Wales|accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009, Charles holds the second-highest ranks in all three branches of the [[Canadian Forces]] and, on 16 June 2012, the Queen awarded the Prince of Wales honorary five-star rank in all three branches of the [[British Armed Forces]], "to acknowledge his support in her role as Commander-in-Chief", installing him as [[Admiral of the Fleet (Royal Navy)|Admiral of the Fleet]], [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] and [[Marshal of the Royal Air Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/the_queen_appoints_the_prince_of_wales_to_honorary_five_star_1126275880.html|title=The Queen Appoints the Prince of Wales to Honorary Five-Star rank|publisher=The Prince of Wales website|date=16 June 2012|accessdate=27 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629032823/http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/the_queen_appoints_the_prince_of_wales_to_honorary_five_star_1126275880.html|archivedate=29 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/prince-charles/9335960/Prince-Charles-awarded-highest-rank-in-all-three-armed-forces.html |title=Prince Charles awarded highest rank in all three armed forces|work=The Telegraph|date=16 June 2012|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=60350|page=23557|date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has been inducted into seven orders and received eight decorations from the Commonwealth realms, and has been the recipient of 20 different honours from foreign states, as well as nine honorary degrees from universities in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.

===Banners, flags, and standards===
The banners used by the prince vary depending upon location. His Personal Standard is the [[Royal Standard of the United Kingdom]] differenced as in his arms with a label of three points Argent, and the escutcheon of the arms of the Principality of Wales in the centre. It is used outside Wales, Scotland, Cornwall, and Canada, and throughout the entire United Kingdom when the prince is acting in an official capacity associated with the UK Armed Forces.&lt;ref name=flags&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/the-prince-of-wales/titles-and-heraldry/standards|title=Standards |publisher=Prince of Wales|access-date=31 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The personal flag for use in Wales is based upon the [[Royal Badge of Wales]] (the historic arms of the [[Kingdom of Gwynedd]]), which consist of four quadrants, the first and fourth with a red lion on a gold field, and the second and third with a gold lion on a red field. Superimposed is an escutcheon [[Vert (heraldry)|Vert]] bearing the single-arched coronet of the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref name=flags/&gt;

In Scotland the personal banner used since 1974 is based upon three ancient Scottish titles: [[Duke of Rothesay]] ([[heir apparent]] to the [[King of Scots]]), [[High Steward of Scotland]] and [[Lord of the Isles]]. The flag is divided into four quadrants like the arms of the Chief of [[Clan Stewart of Appin]]; the first and fourth quadrants comprise a gold field with a blue and silver checkered band in the centre; the second and third quadrants display a black galley on a silver field. The arms are differenced from those of Appin by the addition of an inescutcheon bearing the tressured lion rampant of Scotland; defaced by a plain label of three points Azure to indicate the heir apparent.&lt;ref name=flags/&gt;

In Cornwall, the banner is the arms of the Duke of Cornwall: "[[Sable (heraldry)|Sable]] fifteen [[bezant]]s Or", that is, a black field bearing fifteen gold coins.&lt;ref name=flags/&gt;

In 2011, the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] introduced a [[Royal standards of Canada#Other members of the Royal Family|personal heraldic banner]] for the Prince of Wales for use in Canada, consisting of the shield of the [[Arms of Canada]] defaced with both a blue [[roundel (heraldry)|roundel]] of the [[Prince of Wales's feathers]] surrounded by a wreath of gold maple leaves, and a white label of three points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=2281 | title=The Prince of Wales | publisher=Office of the Governor General of Canada: Canadian Heraldic Authority | work=Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''coat of arms of New Zealand''' is the [[heraldic symbol]] representing the South Pacific island country of [[New Zealand]]. Its design reflects New Zealand's history as a [[bicultural]] nation, with a European female figure on one side and a [[Māori people|Māori]] [[rangatira]] (chief) on the other. The symbols on the central shield represent New Zealand's trade, agriculture and industry, and a [[St Edward's Crown|Crown]] represents New Zealand's status as a [[constitutional monarchy]].

The initial coat of arms was granted by warrant of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] on 26 August 1911, and the current version was granted by [[Elizabeth II of New Zealand|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1956. While the use of the coat of arms is restricted to the [[New Zealand Government]], the symbol enjoys wide use on state decorations; it appears on the uniform of the [[New Zealand Police|police]] and is on the cover of the [[New Zealand passport|national passport]].

==History==
Until 1911, New Zealand used the same [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom|royal coat of arms]] as the [[United Kingdom]]. The [[provinces of New Zealand]] used their own arms.&lt;ref name="ngw"&gt;{{cite web|title=National Arms of New Zealand|url=http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=National_Arms_of_New_Zealand|website=www.ngw.nl|publisher=[[Heraldry of the World]]|accessdate=23 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:New Zealand Coat of Arms (9595593076).jpg|thumb|In 1908 a competition was held to design a coat of arms. This entry, 'Nostra Patria Nostro Generi', is by an unknown designer and was one of the final three selected. It features traditional heraldic imagery of a hippocamp, a lion rampant and a 'sea-lion guardian'.]]
With the evolution of New Zealand self-government, especially the granting of [[Dominion of New Zealand|Dominion status]] in 1907, it was decided that a new coat of arms was required. An official competition held in 1908 received 78 designs.&lt;ref name="ngw"/&gt; The winning entry was a design by James McDonald, a draughtsman in the Department of Tourist and Health Resorts. Some adjustments were made to the design, and the arms were granted by Royal Warrant of King George V on 26 August 1911. The warrant was published in the ''[[New Zealand Gazette]]'' of 11 January 1912.&lt;ref name="warrant"&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Coat of Arms warranted|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/new-zealand-coat-arms-warranted|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=23 August 2017|date=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms have remained similar to the original design, with minor changes made in 1956. The central shield has remained unaltered since 1911. It comprises a quartered shield containing in the first quarter four stars representing the [[Crux|Southern Cross constellation]] (as depicted on the [[Flag of New Zealand|national flag]], but with the stars in different proportions); in the second quarter, a [[golden fleece]]; in the third, a wheat sheaf; and in the fourth, two hammers. (See [[#Symbolism|symbolism]] below.) Overall this is a [[pale (heraldry)|pale]]—a broad vertical strip—with three ships representing the importance of maritime trade and "recalling the 19th-century settlement of the country by European migrants".&lt;ref name="Levine"/&gt;

=== 1956 redesign ===
In 1956, some of the features surrounding the shield were changed. In the original design, the crest was a [[Lion (heraldry)|demi-lion]] (the upper half of a rampant lion) holding the [[Union Flag]], and the scroll at the shield's base featured the then [[motto]] of the country, "Onward". Early renditions of the coat of arms often featured stylised scrolling, replaced in 1956 by fern leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand Coat of Arms 1911-1956'|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/media/photo/new-zealand-coat-arms-1911-1956|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=23 August 2017|date=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One month prior to New Zealand's adoption of the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1947|Statute of Westminster]] (which formally accepted the full external autonomy offered by the British Parliament) on 25 September 1947, a special committee was formed by then Prime Minister [[Peter Fraser (New Zealand politician)|Peter Fraser]]. Responsible for the "redrawing and standardisation of the Coat of Arms", the committee consisted of Alistair McIntosh, Joseph Heenan, Dr Colin Aickman, Frank Corner, Foss Shanahan and Professor [[John Cawte Beaglehole]].&lt;ref name="executivepower" /&gt; One of the committee's concerns was that the female supporter looked too much like a "Soviet heroine". Following the election of the [[First National Government]] in 1949, the new Attorney-General, [[Jack Marshall]] (later Prime Minister) took up responsibility for the committee. Marshall requested the woman to be re-drawn based on the likeness of [[Grace Kelly]], a favourite actress of his.&lt;ref name="executivepower"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://ips.ac.nz/publications/publications/show/288|title=Onward with Executive Power - Lessons from New Zealand 1947 - 1957|isbn=978-1-877347-37-5|year=2010|publisher=Institute of Policy Studies, [[Victoria University of Wellington]]|author=Harshan Kumarasingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism==
[[File:New Zealand Coat of Arms.PNG|thumb|270px|New Zealand coat of arms explained]]&lt;!--Image aligned with infobox--&gt;
The coat of arms depicts a shield with four quadrants divided by a central "[[pale (heraldry)|pale]]":&lt;ref name="Levine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levine|first1=Stephen|title=Coat of arms - Coat of arms overview|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/coat-of-arms/page-1|publisher=[[Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]|date=20 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first quadrant depicts the four stars on the national flag, representing the asterism within the constellation of [[Crux]]; the second quadrant depicts a golden fleece, representing the nation's farming industry; the third depicts a sheaf of wheat for agriculture; and the fourth quadrant depicts crossed hammers for mining.
* The pale depicts three ships, representing the importance of sea trade, and the immigrant nature of all New Zealanders.
* The [[dexter (heraldry)|dexter]] supporter is a European woman carrying the flag of New Zealand, while the [[sinister (heraldry)|sinister]] supporter is a Māori [[rangatira]] (chief) holding a [[taiaha]] (fighting weapon) and wearing a [[Māori traditional textiles#Kaitaka|kaitaka]] (flax cloak).
** The female figure is said to be a depiction of [[Zealandia (personification)|Zealandia]], a common [[national personification]] of New Zealand during the first half of the 20th century. It also broadly represents all "non-indigenous citizens of the country".&lt;ref name="Levine"/&gt; 
* The shield is surmounted by a rendition of [[St. Edward's Crown]], which has been used in the coronations of [[Monarchy of New Zealand|New Zealand's monarchs]]. The Crown also represents New Zealand's historic ties to the United Kingdom.
* Below is a scroll with "New Zealand" on it, behind which (constituting the "heraldic compartment" on which the supporters stand) are two [[Cyathea dealbata|fern]] branches, representing the native vegetation.

None of New Zealand's [[national symbols of New Zealand|national symbols]]—the flag, the anthem or the coat of arms—are mentioned in the [[Constitution Act 1986]]. The official use of the coat of arms was mandated by Royal Warrant in 1911.&lt;ref name="warrant"/&gt; The use of state, royal, and [[Governor-General of New Zealand|viceregal]] emblems is also protected by the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981 No 47 (as at 03 June 2017), Public Act Contents|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1981/0047/43.0/DLM51358.html|website=www.legislation.govt.nz|publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office|accessdate=23 August 2017|language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms are the official symbol of New Zealand as a [[sovereign entity]]. As such, official usage of the coat of arms is restricted to the [[New Zealand Government]]. It is used as a mark of authority by various government agencies and representatives, including the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet]], and most courts, including the [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levine|first1=Stephen|title=Coat of arms, Supreme Court building, Wellington – Coat of arms|url=https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/36250/coat-of-arms-supreme-court-building-wellington|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coat of arms also feature on all [[Acts of Parliament]]; and on the cover of the [[New Zealand passport]], alongside the [[silver fern]], another common symbol of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levine|first1=Stephen|title=New Zealand passport – Coat of arms|url=https://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/35050/new-zealand-passport|publisher=Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[flag of the Governor-General of New Zealand]] has, since 2008, featured the shield of the arms of New Zealand on a blue background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Governor-General's Flag |url=https://gg.govt.nz/office-governor-general/conditions-appointment/governor-generals-flag |publisher=Government House |accessdate=21 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a few occasions—such as royal visits or [[jubilee]] celebrations—individuals and private organisations can display the coat of arms temporarily. It can only be used or published with the permission of the [[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]].&lt;ref name="mch" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3478">'''Cognitive poetics''' is a school of [[literary]] criticism that applies the principles of [[cognitive science]], particularly [[cognitive psychology]], to the interpretation of literary [[Writing|texts]].  It has ties to [[reader-response criticism]], and is also closely related to [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]], whose application to literary study has been most popular in continental [[Europe]]. Like the [[New Critics]], cognitive poetics engages in close analysis of the text, but it recognizes that context has an important role to play in the creation of meaning.

Due to its focus on how readers process the language of texts, cognitive poetics represents simultaneously a turn back in time, to the [[ancient]] study of [[rhetoric]];&lt;ref name=Stockwell2002p8&gt;
"Cognitive poetics is still relatively new as a discipline, though it makes clear reconnections back to much older forms of analysis such as classical rhetoric."
Stockwell (2002): p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
but it also has a grounding in modern principles of [[cognitive linguistics]].

Topics addressed by cognitive poetics include [[deixis]]; text world theory (the feeling of immersion within texts); [[schema (psychology)|schema]], script, and their role in reading; attention; foregrounding; and [[genre]].

One of the main focal points of cognitive literary analysis is [[conceptual metaphor]], an idea pioneered and popularized by the works of [[George Lakoff|Lakoff]], as a tool for examining texts. Rather than regarding metaphors as ornamental [[figures of speech]], cognitive poetics examines how the conceptual bases of such metaphors interact with the text as a whole.

Prominent figures in the field include [[Reuven Tsur]], who is credited for originating the term,&lt;ref&gt;
"Reuven Tsur ... has run a cognitive poetics project since the early 1970s, long before the first publications in cognitive linguistics."
Gerard Steen and Joanna Gavins, "Contextualising cognitive poetics", in Gavins and Steen (2003): p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ronald Langacker]], [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]], Gerard Steen, Joanna Gavins and Peter Stockwell. Although Tsur's original, "precise and particular" sense of the term ''poetics'' was related to his theory of "[[poetry]] and [[perception]]", it has come to be "more broadly applied" to any "theory" or "system" of the workings (Greek ''poiesis'') of literature of any genre.&lt;ref name=Stockwell2002p8 /&gt;

A '''crépinette''' is a small, flattened sausage, sometimes referred to as a sausage parcel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sausagelinks.co.uk/recipe_detail.asp?id=84 ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is similar in shape to a sausage patty, circular, and flattened.

It is made from minced or ground [[pork]], [[turkey meat|turkey]], [[veal]], [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[chicken (food)|chicken]], and can even be made from [[truffles]].&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurious.com/tools/fooddictionary/entry/?id=2159|title=Epicurious – Recipes, Menu Ideas, Videos &amp; Cooking Tips|website=Epicurious}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crépinettes are wrapped in [[caul fat]], rather than wrapped in a casing. It is usually cooked with an outer coating of bread and sautéed in butter.&lt;ref name="one"/&gt;

==Name==

The word ''crépine'' is French for "pig's caul".
The name originated in the second half of the 13th century as "a small ornamental crêpe", being derived from the word crêpe. 
In cookbooks, the term crépinette is sometimes used to indicate the contents of the crépinette only. This is the same as other countries where we find crépinette, sometimes spelled crepinette, to describe both the contents and the dish itself.

==Definition==

A crépinette is a mixture of minced meat stuffed in intestinal membrane.
Although it has a different casing than sausage, it is often described as a sausage dish. It is also described as a round and flat dish in a number of French dictionaries.
The crépinette distinguishes itself by being balled meat wrapped in thin slices of meat.

==Composition==

The stuffing of the crépinette can be made of ground pork, chicken fillets, finely ground game birds (partridge, woodcock, pigeon), and also lamb sweetbreads, calf kidneys, fillets of lark or rabbit, and sliced eel. Viard, however, gives recipes where the contents of the crépinette are not ground but entire pieces of meat.

==Cooking==
The crépinette is cooked in a pan or on a grill.

For Christmas, crépinettes are served with oysters by the oyster farmers of the Marennes-Oléron basin; the same happens in Bordelais where an expert alternates the tasting of a fresh oyster and a hot crépinette.

'''Fictocriticism''' is a [[postmodern]], [[Experimental literature|experimental]], often [[feminist]] style of writing. 

The traditional divisions among the practices of [[fiction]], [[Literary theory|theory]] and [[Literary criticism|criticism]] into stories, essays and critiques tend to be merged with fictocriticism which combines elements of these writing practices into a single [[text (literary theory)|text]]. These texts thus often tell a story while making an argument. They range from avant-gardist prose poems to more discursive metafictional inventions. 

A prominent practitioner of fictocritical [[anthropology]] is Professor [[Michael Taussig]], an Australian working in the Anthropology Department at [[Columbia University]].

Once [[Jacques Derrida]] asked for a name:
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
We must invent a name for those "critical" inventions which belong to literature while deforming its limits.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The name one could have given him was fictocriticism, but he went on anyway to write, and perform, critically, and sometimes fictionally, for instance by telling stories while making his philosophical arguments. 

Fictocriticism might trace its origins to [[Montaigne]], continuing through [[Barthes]] and making a different appearance in the [[New Journalism]] of [[Tom Wolfe]] or [[Joan Didion]]. Tending towards the laid-back narrative, the inclusion of the local and singular; the embrace of contemporary [[culture]] and [[Mass media|media]], the name, and the style, have been adopted enthusiastically in [[Australia]] and [[Canada]].

The '''''Gesta Treverorum''''' (''Deeds of the Trevians'') is a collection of histories, [[legend]]s, [[war]]s, records of the [[Archbishops of Trier]] (Trèves), writings of the [[Pope]]s, and other records that were collected by the monks of the [[St. Matthias Abbey]] in [[Trier]]. It was begun in the 12th century and was continued until 1794 when the Archbishopric of Trier came to an end. An edition was published as an eight-volume set in the 19th century. A new 8-volume edition by Emil Zenz was published in the 1950s and 1960s.

'''Get Up and Bar the Door''' is a [[medieval]] [[Scots language|Scots]] ballad about a battle of wills between a husband and wife. It is [[Child ballad]] 275. According to Child, it was first published by David Herd.&lt;ref&gt;Herd, David (1732-1810):  ''Ancient and Modern Scottish Songs, Heroic Ballads etc.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
 [[File:Get Up and Bar the Door. by Arthur Rackham.png|right|thumb|235 px|Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] of &lt;br&gt;''Get Up and Bar the Door'']]

The song begins with the wife busy in her cooking and other [[House work|chores]]. As the wind picks up, the husband tells her to close and bar the door. They make a pact that the next person who speaks must bar the door, and the door remains open. At midnight two thieves enter the house and eat the [[puddings]] that the wife has just made. The husband and wife watch them, but still neither speaks out of stubborn [[pride]]. Amazed, one of the thieves proposes to molest the wife.  Finally, the husband shouts "Will ye kiss my wife before my een, and scad me wi pudding bree?" The wife, having won the pact, tells the husband, "Goodman, you've spoken the foremost word; Get up and bar the door."

In some versions, the husband is named as Johnie Blunt of Crawford Moor.&lt;ref&gt;Child Vol. VIII p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Child notes that the song was used by Prince Hoare to provide one of the principal scenes in his musical entertainment, ''No Song, No Supper'', performed at Drury Lane in 1790.

Among many things, this folk ballad talks about the sense of lasting competition in a relationship. The man tries to maintain his power but the woman refuses because she does not want to be treated like a doormat; each is too stubborn to do something that will benefit both. The ballad makes the point that being stubborn can be carried to ludicrous lengths, since by being stubborn they lost their Martinmas puddings and left their persons and household open to crime.{{or|date=April 2008}}

==Recordings==
* [[Martin Carthy]] - ''Shearwater'' (as "John Blunt")
* [[Ewan MacColl]] sang it on "The English and Scottish Popular Ballads (The Child Ballads) Volume I" (1956)
* [[Maddy Prior]] and [[June Tabor]] sang a version on "No More to the Dance" as "The Barring o' the Door" (1988)

'''The Grand Master of Magic® Award''' is a lifetime achievement award presented by the Brotherhood of Auckland Magicians Incorporated on behalf of the magicians of New Zealand.  It was first awarded in 1969 and to date it has been awarded on eighteen occasions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bam.net.nz/grand-masters-of-magic/|title=Brotherhood of Auckland Magicians : Grand Master of Magic Award information}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ibmring160"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibmring160.com/national-awards/grand-masters.aspx|title=Grand Master of Magic criteria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geniimagazine.com/magicpedia/Edgar_Benyon|title=Benyon Biography, MagicPedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criteria for the Grand Master of Magic® ==

The criteria for the Grand Master of Magic Award was formalised in 1998 and is as follows :

"Its purpose is to honour those magicians who are acknowledged by their fellow magicians to be masters of the art and craft of [[Magic (illusion)|magic]].  The recipients first and foremost must be [[performers]] of a high standard.  In addition they might be originators of [[magic tricks|magical effects]], or administrators giving time and expertise to running societies and [[magic convention|conventions]].  They could be consistent competition winners, or have an international standing, or be known only in the [[New Zealand]] setting.  But above all they are people who have served magic well, have graced our art, and made a special contribution over many years."

Any nomination must also be measured against the standard achieved by the previous recipients.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibmring160" /&gt;

'''''How the Toys Saved Christmas''''' (Original [[Italian language|Italian]] title ''La freccia azzurra'', {{lang-en|The Blue Arrow}}) is a 1996 Italian animated film directed by [[Enzo D'Alò]].

==Plot==
When [[Santa]]'s helper La [[Befana]] falls ill and must take off a Christmas Eve, she recruits Scarafoni to help deliver all the toys. No one but the toys knows is that Scarafoni plans to auction off the toys to the highest bidder, which means the toys won't make it to the children who have been good all year and deserve them. The toys decide to deliver themselves starting with a [[Wind-up toy|wind-up]] [[teddy bear]] going to the little boy's bed, and the story follows them as they struggle to avoid the heartless Scarafoni and to find their true homes. Meanwhile, a young boy named Francesco tries to find his true Christmas present - one special friend. In the end, the toys deliver themselves, but Scarafoni still has the money. However, everyone rushes to the toy shop and find Scarafoni with the money and manage to get it back from him, as Scarafoni is sent to prison. Francesco gets his true friend - a new puppy whose name is Jingles (voiced by [[Sonja Ball]]).

==U.S. version==
In 1997, the film was imported to the U.S. and released [[direct-to-video]] by [[Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|Buena Vista Home Video]], under the title "How the Toys Saved Christmas" (although, as shown in the previews, originally going to be titled "The Toys Who Saved Christmas"). The film featured [[Mary Tyler Moore]] as the voice for the Befana, who was named "Granny Rose", [[Tony Randall]] as Scarafoni (whose name suggest "scarafaggio" that means beetle), who was named "Mr. Grimm", and Michael Caloz as Francesco, who was named "Christopher Winter". The film also had some scenes from the original Italian release deleted or placed before other scenes, along with some music scores taken out and new music added in.

In the original version, the story took place during the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] Eve, because in Italian folklore the Befana is a good witch that gives presents and candies to the children during the night between 5 and 6 January.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5334">'''Jewish views on suicide''' are mixed. In [[Orthodox Judaism]], suicide is forbidden by [[Jewish law]], and viewed as a [[sin]]. Non-Orthodox forms of Judaism may instead recognize the act as more akin to a death by a disease or disorder (except in cases of purposeful assisted suicide). Rabbinical scholars (certainly in the reformed movements) command compassion both for the deceased and the survivors.

== Assisted suicide ==
Assisting in suicide and requesting such assistance (thereby creating an accomplice to a sinful act) is also forbidden, a minimal violation of Leviticus 19:14, "Do not put a [[stumbling block]] before the blind", for the Rabbis interpreted that verse to prohibit any type of [[stumbling block]]: theological (e. g., persuading people to believe in false doctrine), economic (e. g., giving bad financial advice), or in this case moral stumbling blocks, as well as physical ones.&lt;ref&gt;See Talmud Bavli (B.) Pesah.im 22b; B. Mo'ed Katan 5a, 17a; B. Bava Mezia 75b.; and B. Nedarim 42b).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Talmudic Sources ==
The prohibition against suicide is mentioned in the Talmud in Tractate Bava Kama 91b. [[Semahot]] (Evel Rabbati) 2:1&amp;ndash;5 serves as the basis for most of later Jewish law on suicide, together with Genesis Rabbah 34:13, which bases the biblical prohibition on Genesis 9:5: "And surely your blood of your lives, will I require."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. M.T. Laws of Murder 2:3; Babylonian Talmud tractate Laws of Courts (Sanhedrin) 18:6; S.A. Yoreh De'ah (Code of Jewish Law) 345:1ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Committee on Jewish Law and Standard ==
The [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standard]]s, the body of scholars of [[halakha|Jewish law]] in [[Conservative Judaism]], has published a [[responsa]] on suicide and assisted suicide in the Summer 1998 issue of ''Conservative Judaism'', Vol. L, No. 4. It affirms the prohibition, then addresses the growing trend of Americans and Europeans to seek assistance with suicide. The Conservative ''teshuva'' notes that while many people get sick, often with terminal illnesses, most people do not try to kill themselves. The committee believes we are obliged to determine why some seek help with suicide and to ameliorate those circumstances.

The [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] response states:

: "... those who commit suicide and those who aid others in doing so act out of a plethora of motives. Some of these reasons are less than noble, involving, for example, children's desires to see Mom or Dad die with dispatch so as not to squander their inheritance on 'futile' health care, or the desire of insurance companies to spend as little money as possible on the terminally ill."

The paper says the proper response to severe [[pain]] is not suicide, but better pain control and more pain [[medication]]. Many doctors, it asserts, are deliberately keeping such patients in pain by refusing to administer sufficient pain medications: some out of ignorance; others to avoid possible drug addiction; others from a misguided sense of [[stoicism]]. Conservative Judaism holds that such forms of reasoning are "bizarre" and cruel, that with today's medications there is no reason for people to be in perpetual torture.

== Collective suicides in Jewish history ==
Judaism has many teachings about peace and compromise that present physical violence as one of the last possible options. Although killing oneself is forbidden under normal Jewish law as being a denial of God's goodness in the world, under extreme circumstances, when there has seemed no choice but to either be killed or forced to betray their religion, Jews have committed [[suicide]] or [[mass suicide]] (see [[Masada]], [[History of the Jews in France#First persecution of the Jews|First French persecution of the Jews]], and [[York Castle]] for examples). 

== Views on martyrdom ==
As a grim reminder of those times, there is even a prayer in the Jewish liturgy for "when the knife is at the throat", for those dying "to sanctify God's Name". (See: ''[[martyrdom]]''). These acts have received mixed responses by Jewish authorities; some regard them as examples of heroic martyrdom, and others saying that while Jews should always be willing to face martyrdom if necessary, it was wrong for them to have taken their own lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religionfacts.com/euthanasia/judaism.htm |title=Euthanasia and Judaism: Jewish Views of Euthanasia and Suicide |publisher=ReligionFacts |date= |accessdate=2008-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myjewishlearning.com/lifecycle/Death/Issues_in_Death/Suicide.htm My Jewish Learning: Suicide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017213307/http://www.myjewishlearning.com/lifecycle/Death/Issues_in_Death/Suicide.htm |date=2008-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Survival and conflict ==
Because Judaism focuses on this life, many questions to do with survival and conflict (such as the classic [[morality|moral]] [[dilemma]] of two people in a desert with only enough water for one to survive) were analysed in great depth by the rabbis within the Talmud, in the attempt to understand the principles a godly person should draw upon in such a circumstance.

== Story ==
Daniel Park is an unpopular, fat, ugly, and bullied high school student who is looked down upon. Constantly bullied and harassed everyday, he often reacts rashly to his mother, and asks for a school transfer. Resolving to run away from his current problems and to start fresh, he moves to Seoul and goes to his new high school. However, the night before he goes to school, he obtains a new body which is tall, muscular, and very handsome. 

Now being able to see the world through a completely different view, he experiences the world as someone who everyone envies. Despite this, his days are always split between the two bodies, resolving to use his handsome body for the daytime and the other for night. As Daniel lives his life with his two bodies, he begins to see just how much the world discriminates against people simply for being "different." Hence the titular name of "Lookism." 

Through his original body, he experiences the world's discrimination and hate, while also seeing the beauty of the world through the other. His new body takes him through numerous life experiences from becoming a miniature celebrity, a trainee for an entertainment company, living through the underworld of Seoul, and modeling for clothes. Once the day turns to night, however, this rosy dream turns back into a harsh reality of what the world really is, all the discrimination coming back to haunt Daniel once more.

==Characters==

===Main Characters===
''Park Hyung Suk/Daniel Park :'' Daniel Park was seen as an immature high school student that is bullied by Logan Lee at the start of the series, transferred by his mother and he woke up one day with a slimmer and near-perfect body near his chubby one. Over time, however, his naivety disappears, and he begins to mature more and more. Through his new body, he makes new friends and gradually begins to blossom into someone with a kind and courageous heart. He studies at J high school in the fashion department. He likes the chubby Crystal in both forms, but she prefers the chubby one over his beautiful body

''Lee Eun Tae/Vasco :'' Vasco, from the architecture dept., has the reputation of being a Robin Hood, as in he stands up for the weak and the bullied. He is one of the strongest of the comic and looks like a gangster (he's the leader of a group called Burn Knuckles). He looks imposing and rarely shows emotions, except shedding tears (a running gag), but in reality, he is very sweet and seeks the friendship of those he deems as good people. He is the childhood friend of Jace.

==Theme==
The title speaks on itself, [[lookism]], or bias upon external part of a person. The main character is a fat, bespectacled man and bullied by stronger men.
The story also has themes about bullying (both physical, verbal and mental), physical violence (like Vasco getting doodles by a bully during his youth), hierarchy based on strength and looks, extortion, [[animal hoarding]], [[stalking]] to the point of obsession, [[gangsterism]], [[scams]], robbery, and even darker themes like rape, celebrity pressures, acute physical injuries and even attempted murder (in which Jiho [[defenestration|pushed]] Daniel and James through a window).

==Character designs==
Daniel Park's design was inspired by a model named Park Hyeong-seok. Jay Hong's design was inspired by Hong Jae-yeol, another model. DG was inspired on [[G-Dragon]]. The creator of manga is Park Tae-joon, another fitting model and all his characters are designed after real-life persons.

The '''Manisa relief''', also known as the '''Akpınar relief''' and the '''Cybele relief''' ({{Lang-tr|'Taş Suret'}} (Cliff image) or  '''Sipil Heykeli''' (Sipylos Monument)), is a Hittite [[rock relief]] at Akpınar, about 5 km east of the Turkish provincial capital of [[Manisa]] above an amusement park on the road to [[Salihli]]. It depicts a [[Hittite mythology|Hittite]] divinity.  Rock reliefs are a prominent aspect of [[Hittite art]]. 

== Description ==
[[File:KybeleStatue19thCenturyPostcardMountSipylusManisaTurkey.jpg|thumb|left|Depiction on a French postcard, c.1900]]
The relief is located in a niche about 100-120 m up a granite cliff-face of [[Mount Sipylus]], overlooking the city of Manisa, the ancient [[Lydia]]n city of [[Magnesia ad Sipylum]], and the [[Gediz River|Gediz]] river valley (the ancient Hermos). It is over 6 m  high and in poor condition. 

A seated figure 8-10 m high is depicted in high relief (but not completely separated from the cliff face), who looks northwards and wears a tall pointed headdress. Its hands seem to rest on its breasts, the feet rest atop a footstool. The head has partly cleaved away, from natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;G.E. Bean, ''Aegean Turkey: an archaeological guide'', vol. ii, pp 31-33 and pl. 3; C. P. Jones, "A Geographical Setting for the Baucis and Philemon Legend (Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' 8.611-724)" ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' '''96''' (1994:203-23 and pls. I-IV) pp 210f, with bibliography.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two remnants of [[Luwian hieroglyphs|Luwian hieroglyphic]] inscriptions are visible to the right of his head, which indicate that the relief dates to the Hittite period. [[Cecil John Cadoux]] thought a date in the time of [[Suppiluliuma I]] or his son [[Mursili II]] (i.e. 14th century BC) was probable.&lt;ref&gt;
Cecil John Cadoux: ''Ancient Smyrna. A history of the city from the earliest times to 324 A.D.'' Blackwell, Oxford 1938, pp. 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helmuth Theodor Bossert]] read the leftmost inscription (Akpınar 1) as "Prince Kuwalanamuwa", the same name which is found on the [[Hanyeri relief]], but it is unclear whether both refer to the same individual. The right inscription (Akpınar 2) was not legible to [[Hans Gustav Güterbock]], who studied the relief with R.A. Alexander in 1978.&lt;ref name="Ehringhaus"&gt;Horst Ehringhaus: ''Götter, Herrscher, Inschriften.'' 2005, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In the second century AD, [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] recorded the figure in his ''Description of Greece'' as a depiction of the mother goddess, [[Cybele]], made by [[Broteas]] the son pf [[Tantalos]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias 3.22.4 [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.3.22.4&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160, English translation].&lt;/ref&gt; Several travellers in the 18th and 19th centuries described the work, including [[Richard Chandler]], [[Charles Texier]], [[Gustav Hirschfeld]] and [[Archibald Henry Sayce]].&lt;ref name="Ehringhaus"/&gt; 
The interpretation of the figure is disputed. Bossert's identification with Cybele was rejected by [[Kurt Bittel]] as unsustainable, but he still saw a female goddess,&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Bittel. "Kubaba – Kybele." in [[Erich Ebeling]], [[Bruno Meissner]], [[Dietz Otto Edzard]] (ed.): ''[[Reallexikon der Assyriologie und vorderasiatischen Archäologie]].'' Vol. 6: ''Klagegesang – Libanon.'' Walter de Gruyter, Berlin 1983, {{ISBN|3-11-010051-7}}, p. 264, [https://books.google.com/books?id=OIeiZaIo91IC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;dq=manisa+kybele&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=manisa%20kybele&amp;f=false in Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Ekrem Akurgal]]. Peter Z. Spanos, however, interprets the figure as the Weather god,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Z. Spanos: "Einige Bemerkungen zum sogenannten Niobe-Monument bei Manisa (Magnesia ad Sipylum)." ''Beiträge zur Altertumskunde Kleinasiens. Festschrift für Kurt Bittel.'' Zabern, Mainz 1983, pp. 477-483.&lt;/ref&gt; which conforms to the general tendency today to interpret the image as a male god; Ehringhaus suggests it is a mountain god.&lt;ref name="Ehringhaus"/&gt;

As a result of confusion with a different natural rock formation near Manisa, which resembles a sitting figure and is known as ''Weeping [[Niobe]]'', this relief is sometimes, incorrectly, known as the ''Niobe cliffs''.

{{Nihongo|'''Nōtan'''|濃淡}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[design]] concept involving the play and placement of light and dark elements as they are placed next to the other in the [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] of [[art]] and [[image]]ry.

==Uses==
This use of light and dark translates shape and form into flat shapes on a two-dimensional surface. Nōtan is traditionally presented in [[paint]], [[ink]], or cut [[paper]], but it is relevant to a host of modern-day image-making techniques, such as [[lithography]] in [[printmaking]], and [[rotoscope|rotoscoping]] in [[animation]].

The '''Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society''', also known as '''PPTS''', was a [[text publication society]], which specialised in publishing editions and translations of medieval texts relevant to the history of pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]]. The society was established in London to provide translations of accounts by pilgrims and other travelers between the 4th and 15th centuries. Particular attention was given to accounts containing geographical or topographical information, as well as those which discussed the manners and customs of the Holy Land. The original narratives were written in a variety of languages, including Greek, Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, Old French, Russian, and German.

The Society first started publishing its work in 1884, and continued for eleven years, publishing a total of twelve volumes. In 1896, these works were transferred to the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]], for distribution to the members of the PPTS.&lt;ref&gt;''The New International Encyclopedia'', edited by Daniel Coit Gilman, Harry Thurston Peck, Frank Moore Colby, 1903&lt;/ref&gt;

The editions remain valuable and are frequently cited in scholarly works. A version is also available as ''The library of the Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Library of the Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society|isbn= 978-0-404-04890-7|year=1971|publisher=AMS Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain well-known pilgrimages included are those of:

* [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Unknown Pilgrim of Bordeaux]]
* [[Saint Jerome]]'s ''Pilgrimage of the Holy Paula''
* [[Mukaddasi]]'s description of Syria
* [[Jacques de Vitry]]
* Bohaedden's ''Life of [[Saladin]]''
* John Poloner's description of the Holy Land

'''Peter Richards''' is both an artist and [[curator]] living and working in [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]], since 1994. Born in Cardiff in 1970, Richards studied a BA in Fine Art at Howard Gardens, Cardiff, part of the [[University of Wales]]. He moved to Northern Ireland to further his studies, completing an MPhil. entitled "Representations of Representations" in 1998 at the [[University of Ulster]]. He has been director of the [[Golden Thread Gallery]] in Belfast since 2002.

==Artist==
Early in his career Richards was producing predominantly [[video art]] works. These works generally took the form of single-channel installations, featuring the artist perform to camera, such as his "Untitled: table &amp; chair".&lt;ref&gt;Art Action 1958–1998, editions Intervention, p424-426. {{ISBN|2-920500-19-8}} [http://isbndb.com/d/book/art_action_1958_1998.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
In the mid-1990s he began creating [[performance art]] works and photographic documentation of the performance art as a single entity.&lt;ref&gt;McAvera, Brian, Standing in the Way of Control, exhibition catalogue. {{ISBN|978-0-903009-91-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sofaer, Joshua, Conflict of Interest: Performance as a Spectator, Performance Research Journal, Volume 5.1, Spring {{ISBN|0-415-24102-2}} [http://isbndb.com/d/book/performance_research_v5_issu_1.html], [[Routledge]] – 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of "performance lucida" series took place as part of House Style, a group event at The Bedroom Gallery (The Bedroom Gallery later went on to become BoBo's in London) in the east of Belfast. His first solo exhibition took place at the Context Gallery, Derry, as part of Beyond Borders Plus and was entitled ''Corrective Perspective''. The work was in three parts, the first an installation featuring a pulley system and the gallery being divided into two, one brightly lit and the other in complete darkness. The second part featured a performance that saw the artist hung upside down from the pulley system and swing toward the dividing wall. The audience had been assembled in the darkened space to witness a live project, caused due to a pinhole in the wall, onto three large sheets of previously unexposed photographic paper.

The nature of the projection inverted the image of the artist, who appeared on the screen to be performing a series of gravity defying acts. When the performance was complete, the artist was lowered from the pulley system. He then came through to the darkened space and proceeded to process the now exposed photographic paper. He put forward that the audience had witnessed the documentation of the action/event rather the action/event itself. The third part of the work saw the photographic paper installed in the gallery with the residue from the event.
Richards developed a significant body of works exploring the representations of documentation of performance art as featured in publications. He also created a series of "collective histories" of performance art works.&lt;ref&gt;Hanrahan, Suin, "Peter Richards: Photographing Performance", ''[[Source (photography magazine)|Source]]'', No.20, pp. 30–31, Autumn.&lt;/ref&gt; Stating that these works acted as a model for simple contradicts between knowledge and experience that are formative of our understanding.&lt;ref&gt;New Contemporaries 99, exhibition catalogue. {{ISBN|0-9515556-8-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently Richards has explored other aspects of our interpretation of representations, focusing in particular on the subject of 'memorials'&lt;ref&gt;Drury, Richards, Dogs Have No Religion, exhibition catalogue. {{ISBN|80-7056-138-6}} [http://www.britishcouncil.org/czechrepublic-arts-viusal-arts-dogs-have-no-religion.htm]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;Grigg, Jennifer.L., "On The Walls in Belfast", ''Afterimage'', Vol. 26, No. 5, March/April.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Portraits from a 50's Archive, [[Belfast Exposed]], catalogue. {{ISBN|0-9524217-6-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He has exhibited extensively nationally and internationally most notably participating in first presentation at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Mulholland, Suzanna Chan, Michele Robecchi, ''The Nature of Things'', British Council &amp; Arts Council of Northern Ireland, catalogue. {{ISBN|0-9540086-1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curator==
When Richards began his professional career in Belfast in the mid-1990s he was working both as an artist and as a curator. He was based at [[Catalyst Arts]], Northern Ireland's pioneering contemporary visual arts, artist-run organisation (est 1994) between 1996 and 1998. Since his time at Catalyst Arts Richards has worked as a guest curator at the Context Gallery in Derry and at the Old Museum Arts Centre in Belfast. His curatorial contribution to contemporary art in Northern Ireland is best known for his work at the [[Golden Thread Gallery]], where he has worked since 2001, to profile established contemporary Northern Irish artists, such as: [[Lisa Byrne]], Ian Charlesworth, Colin Darke, [[Willie Doherty]], Susan MacWilliam, [[Mary McIntyre]], Locky Morris, Philip Napier, Aisling O'Beirn, [[Paul Seawright]], Dan Shipsides, [[Victor Sloan]]. He has also worked with their peers internationally, such as [[William Kentridge]], Destiny Deacon, Marjectica Potrc, Azorro Group, [[Zbigniew Libera]], Shane Cullen, Delcy Morelos, Gerald Byrne. Richards has worked closely with a number of younger artists creating a platform for them to develop their practice.

[[File:Kurskaya korennaya.jpg|thumb|350px|''Religious Procession in Kursk Province'', [[Tretyakov Gallery]], Moscow. 175 × 280 cm]]

''''' Religious Procession in Kursk Governorate''''' (also known as '''''Easter Procession in the District of Kursk''''' or '''''A Religious Procession in Kursk Gubernia''''''&lt;ref&gt;The English title used by the Tretyakov, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;) (Russian: '''''Крестный ход в Курской губернии''''') is a large oil on canvas painting by the Russian [[Realism (visual arts)|realist]] painter and sculptor [[Ilya Repin]] (1844–1930). Completed between 1880 and 1883, the work shows a seething, huddled mass attending the annual religious procession (''[[crucession]]'') carrying the famous icon [[Our Lady of Kursk]] from its home at the {{ill|Korennaya Monastery|ru|Коренная пустынь|pl|Pustelnia Korzenna}} to the nearby city of [[Kursk]] in western Russia.  

The procession is led through a dusty landscape by robed, [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] priests holding [[icon]]s, [[festoons]] and banners over their heads.&lt;ref name="B146"&gt;Brinton, Christian. "Modern Artists", 2007. 146. {{ISBN|1-4067-3795-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behind them follow a crowd mostly of peasants, but ranging from beggars and cripples, police and military officers to figures from the provincial elite. ''Religious Procession'' led to controversy when first exhibited due to the icon being held by a man who appears to be drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Geisler, Michael E. "National symbols, fractured identities: contesting the national narrative". Middlebury, 2005. 104. {{ISBN|1-58465-437-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is a continuation of Repin's social commentary in his work, and highlights perceived abuses by both church and state. He wrote of the work, " am applying all of my insignificant forces to try to give true incarnation to my ideas; life around me disturbs me a great deal and gives me no peace – it begs to be captured on canvas..."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tretyakovgallery.ru/en/collection/_show/image/_id/211 Krestny Khod (Religious Procession) in Kursk Gubernia]". [[Tretyakov Gallery]]. Retrieved on 13 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Our Lady of Kursk.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The [[Our Lady of Kursk]] [[icon]], 13th century]]
At the right, burly peasants carry a platform holding the icon inside an elaborate neo-classical case; only gleams of light reflecting off the gold ''[[riza]]'' icon-cover can be made out. Lines of peasants joining hands hold back the crowd, the foremost at the left trying to stop the crippled boy breaking through the cordon with his stick. Alongside ride peasant or priest stewards and officials and police in uniform, some of the latter beating back the crowd with their [[riding crop]]s. Behind the icon follow priests and better-dressed people, carrying icons in front of their chest, and an "effete, dandified and bored priest" in vestments carefully straightens his hair.&lt;ref name="J44"&gt;Jackson, 44&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a comic effect with a stout middle-aged woman in a yellow dress and bonnet carrying an icon behind him, who looks very like a priest in his vestments. An empty icon-case, presumably that of the icon carried by the wealthy woman behind, is carried with as much reverence as the icon itself.&lt;ref name="J44" /&gt; The hillside at right appears to have been recently cleared of timber, with fresh tree stumps. Further back another platform, holding what appears to be a circular icon, is preceded by two large banners, and behind that a large [[processional cross]] can be made out through the cloud of dust.   [[File:Korennaja4.jpg|thumb|175px|left|The Korennaya Monastery]]

The ''Procession'' is representative of Repin's style from the period, in that it first appears to be a scene from everyday life in Russia. In fact, it pointedly shows people from a range of social strata united and moving collectively towards their destination at Korennaya.&lt;ref name="B160"&gt;Brettell, Richard. "Modern art, 1851–1929: capitalism and representation". Oxford Paperbacks, 1999. 160. {{ISBN|0-19-284220-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance and critical opinion==
The painting was highly popular, but controversial. The journal publishing a favourable review by the leading critic [[Vladimir Stasov]] published an editorial in the next issue dissociating itself from his views, and a second review by the editor. Stasov had made much of the violence of the riders to the crowd. Apart from [[Leo Tolstoy]], who praised the painting and regarded it as neutral in its depiction of the social system, all were agreed that it was hostile to the established social order. Another reviewer noted with disapproval the "undesirables who thronged around it at exhibition, noting a preponderance of liberated women with short haircuts, [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] young men, and a strong Jewish element; the chief characters of Imperial [[xenophobia]]".&lt;ref name="J44"/&gt;

The writer Richard Brettell summarised the painting as "a sort of ''[[summa]]'' of Russian society, diverse members of which move uneasily but restlessly together down a dusty path through a naked landscape towards a future that cannot be seen even by the painter."&lt;ref name="B160" /&gt; Critic Christian Brinton saw a mixture of "fat, gold-robed priests, stupid peasants, wretched cripples, cruel mouthed officials, and inflated rural dignitaries".&lt;ref name="B146" /&gt; Repin is less sympathetic to the privileged members of the procession, whom he depicts as uncaring and indifferent to their struggling fellow travelers. The disenfranchised members of Russian society are represented by, amongst others, the old and young peasants in the left foreground  ([[serfdom in Russia]] had been abolished in 1861).

The painting was bought by the leading collector [[Pavel Tretyakov]] for a record 10,000 [[rouble]]s, but Tretyakov wanted Repin to replace the maids carrying the empty icon-case with "a beautiful young girl, exuding spiritual rapture". Repin refused.&lt;ref name="J44" /&gt; Tretyakov's large collection was opened as a museum in his lifetime, and is now the much augmented, state-run [[Tretyakov Gallery]] in [[Moscow]].

'''San Giacomo della Spada''' ("Saint James of the Sword") is a  [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] church in [[Alcamo]], in the  [[province of Trapani]], adjoning it there was the ''Hospice of Pilgrims''.

== Historical hints ==
The church rose as a  chapel dedicated to the Saint who gave the name to one of the most ancient quarters in Alcamo; it is mentioned in two notorial deeds dating back to 1380&lt;ref name="catgui"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare Golfo p.36, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a document of the Episcopal [[Curia]] in 1435.

The church was built before 1529 and reconstructed in 1571 and in 1596, then widened between the years 1625-36. From the architectonic point of view, it is  beautiful: there was an altar with a painting of Saint James and some pilgrims on the way to the  [[Santiago de Compostela|Sanctuary of Compostela]]; on the sides of the altar there were placed two statues of Saint James and [[Saint Andrew]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comune.alcamo.tp.it/in-citta/biblioteche/203-biblioteca-san-giacomo-de-spada.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1866 laws on the suppression of religious Corporations, the church was  confiscated and given to the town [[municipality]], which used it as a Civic Library from 1875 to 1968 .&lt;ref name="catgui"/&gt; 
Today (June 2018), after the last restoration works, it is the seat of the [[Ethnographic Museum of Musical Instruments "Gaspare Cannone"]].

== The Confraternity ==
Since 1569 it hosted a  [[Confraternity]] of Saint James of the Pilgrims, with the scope of assisting pilgrims, and the Confraternity of [[Saint Christopher]], founded 40 years before, joined it;&lt;ref name="catcon"&gt;Carlo Cataldo, La conchiglia di S.Giacomo p.89-90, Alcamo, Campo, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; both of them had the running of a [[hospice]] for pilgrims which had to be founded.

The two confraternities had the privilege of “Fiera franca”, that is any [[tax exemption]] during the period of the feast, so the money saved, together with that one saved in the following years, was to be used for the assistance of  pilgrims and the building of a hospice. As the periods were coincident for both Congregations, this provoked a quarrel between them and a fusion of the two [[institutions]] in one Confraternity, later elevated to a Company in 1619.

Its brethren had a deep blue [[sackcloth]], with mantles and hats, and they wore a red [[cross]] as [[emblem]] and  a cane on their hands, like pilgrims. After the change to a Company occurred in 1619 (as affirms the historian Ignazio de Blasi), they probably wore "a sackcloth and white [[visors]], with the emblem of the cross ending like a sword, the characteristic insignia of the glorious Saint James, on the shoulders" .
[[File:Biblioteca_Multimediale_(Alcamo)_01.jpg|thumb|The Interior today]]
In 1642 they were renewed the  privilege of ''Fiera franca'' and built, next to the church, a Hospice for pilgrims, working from  1649 to 1746,&lt;ref name="catgui"/&gt;  and that they had not completed in 1649 yet. These hospices were located in the town centres and carried out different activities, assisting poor or sick people, widows, orphans and [[foundlings]],&lt;ref&gt;Vincenzo Regina, Cavalieri ospedalieri e pellegrini per le antiche vie della provincia di Trapani, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; much more when the number of pilgrims on long distances decreased a lot.

In 1749 the Company did not run the hospice any longer, and probably it had been dissolved before; the Congregation of Charity, that  administered its financial incomes, as they did not host pilgrims going to the [[Holy Land]] or to the various sanctuaries, assigned those financial returns to the [[poorhouse]] (Ricovero di Mendicità) which had to be founded using the patrimony inherited from the De Blasi Mangione.

'''''Sicilian Questions''''' (المسائل الصقلية, al-Masāʼil al-Ṣiqilliyya, in [[Arabic]]) is the name of [[Ibn Sab'in]]'s masterpiece, one of the leading representatives of the [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]]ian [[Sufi|mystic]] of the 13th century. Its doctrines are marked by the influence of two great philosophical areas, the [[Peripateticism]] and [[Sufism]], which makes it a very interesting writing for researchers and scholars. This work contains the answer given by him to some philosophical questions raised by the famous Emperor [[Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]] (1215 -1250) and has been defined as "symbol on the intellectual relations between medieval Christian [[Europe]] and the [[Islamic world]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dario Cabanelas]], "Federico II de Sicilia e Ibn Sab'in de Murcia. Las Cuestiones Sicilianas", ''Miscelánea de Estudios Árabes y Hebraicos'', 4, 1955, pp.48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; 
On the ''Sicilian Questions'' exist, so far, the complete editions of Serefettin Yaltkaya,&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sab'in, ''al-Kalam 'ala-l-al-Siqiliyya Masa'il'', text published by Serefettin Yaltkaya, Bayrut 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Sab'in, Correspondance philosophique avec l'Empereur Frederic II of Hohenstaufen, Arabic text published by Serefettin Yaltkaya, with Introduction by Henry Corbin, Paris 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; according to the 534th Arabic manuscript from the Bodleian Library at Oxford; and several complete translations: to [[Turkish language|Turkish]],&lt;ref&gt;Serefettin Yaltkaya, ''Sicilya cevaplari Ibni Sabinin Sicilya Krali ikinci Frederikin felsefi sorgularina verdigi cevaplarin tercemesidir'', Istanbul 1934 (full translation into Turkish).&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Italian language|Italian]],&lt;ref&gt;Patrizia Spallino, ''Le questioni siciliane. Federico II e l' universo filosofico'', Introduction, translation and notes, presentation of Aladdin Bakri, Palermo 2002 (full translation into Italian)&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Spanish language|Spanish]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Luisa Arvide]], ''Las Cuestiones Sicilianas'', Introduction, edition, translation and notes, Grupo Editorial Universitario, Granada 2009 (full translation into Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as diverse partial translations: to [[French language|French]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Michele Amari]], "Questions philosophiques adressées aux savants musulmans par l´empereur Frédéric II", ''Journal Asiatique'', 5. série, 1 (1853), pp.240-274 (French translation of fragments).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;August Ferdinand Mehren, "Correspondance du philosophe soufi Ibn Sab´in Abdou l-Haqq avec l´empereur Frédéric II de Hohenstaufen", ''Journal Asiatique'', 7. série, 14 (1879), pp.341-454 (French translation of Question IV)&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Italian language|Italian]],&lt;ref&gt;Mario Grignaschi, "Ibnu Sab´în, Al-Kalâmu ´alâ-l-masâ´ili -ç-çiqiliyyati, Trattato sulle domande siciliane.

Regarding the author's style, the book has obvious signs of eloquence and elegance, as well as extensive scientific knowledge. But at the same time, it warns, sometimes, a certain monotony, excessive rhetoric, with consequent abrupt interruptions retakes, disjunctions, etc. Through its pages the text shows a peculiar mix of Aristotelian influence and Neoplatonic Sufi mysticism, and an overview of the most important doctrines of the science of antiquity, including for instace, the logic of Aristotle.

==Structure==
The treatise is divided into a prologue, wrote perhaps one of his disciples, which explains the origin of the correspondence, the answer to the four philosophical questions raised by [[Frederick II of Hohenstaufen]], a Appendix referred to several issues, and finally, an epilogue.

As usual in medieval Arabic treatises, and how could it be otherwise, if we take into account the rich and highly educated of [[Ibn Sab'in]], in the ''Sicilian Questions'' the author quotes from other writers, especially those in the classical antiquity; among them are, for example, [[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'' and especially those belonging to the logic of [[Aristotle]], as the most relevant. Similarly, and for the same reason, it makes frequent references to ancient philosophers and thinkers to a greater extent, but also to his fellow followers of other faiths and representatives of the most varied theories and doctrines, explained or simply commented on the work, which make it a rich melting pot of scientific knowledge to justify the time and interest in it. Among all these philosophers, he notes, the volume of citations is made on his thought and his writings, [[Aristotle]], which is really central to the treaty and the Andalusian mystic most often named as the Wise (''al-Hakim'') and the Man (''al-Rayul'').

Other important philosophers and thinkers in the ''Sicilian Questions'' referred to are, in alphabetical order, [[Alexander of Aphrodisias]], [[Anaxagoras]], [[Berossus]], [[Crates of Thebes|Crates]], [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]], [[Euclid]], [[al-Farabi]], [[Galen]], [[al-Ghazali]], [[Mansur Al-Hallaj|al-Hallaj]], [[Avempace|Ibn Bajja]] (Avempace), [[Avicenna|Ibn Sina]] (Avicenna), [[Iamblichus]], [[Parmenides]], [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]], [[Socrates]], [[Themistius]], [[Theophrastus]] and [[Zeno of Elea]].

The masterful character of the work lies at the confluence of all these philosophical currents which combine great diversity of theories and beliefs.

The '''sociology of art''' is a subfield of [[sociology]] concerned with the social worlds of [[art]] and [[aesthetics]].

Studying the sociology of art throughout history is the study of the [[social history of art]], how various societies contributed to the appearance of certain artists.

In her 1970 book ''Meaning and Expression: Toward a Sociology of Art'', Hanna Deinhard gives these defining features of a sociology of art: "The point of departure of the sociology of art is the question: How is it possible that works of art, which always originate as products of human activity ''within'' a particular time and society and ''for'' a particular time, society, or function -- even though they are not necessarily produced as 'works of art' -- can live beyond their time and seem expressive and meaningful in completely different epochs and societies? On the other hand, how can the age and society that produced them be recognized in the works?&lt;ref name="M&amp;E" /&gt;"

'''''Southpaw''''' is a 2015 American [[Sports film|sports drama]] film directed by [[Antoine Fuqua]], written by [[Kurt Sutter]] and starring [[Jake Gyllenhaal]], [[Forest Whitaker]] and [[Rachel McAdams]]. The film follows a boxer who sets out to get his life back on track after losing his wife in an accident and his young daughter to protective services. The film was released on July 24, 2015, by [[The Weinstein Company]].

The film marked one of the last films to be scored by [[James Horner]], and one of three posthumous releases to feature his music. The film and the [[Southpaw (soundtrack)|film's soundtrack album]] are dedicated to his memory.

==Plot==
Billy "The Great" Hope is an undefeated [[Professional boxing|professional boxer]] living in the suburbs of [[New York City]] with his wife Maureen and their daughter Leila. Billy's particular style of fighting often leaves him beaten and bruised. During a match in which he defends his [[light heavyweight]] world title, Billy sustains an eye injury as well as heavy blows to the face and body, leaving him coughing up blood for days. He is finally convinced by Maureen to retire before he becomes forever "punch-drunk". During the press conference at the post-match, an up-and-coming boxer Miguel "Magic" Escobar taunts Billy and tries to get Billy to fight him. At a charity event for the orphanage where he and his wife both grew up, Escobar is in attendance, and as Billy is leaving, Escobar threatens he'll take Maureen and his title away from him, and while Maureen tells Billy to let it go and go home with her, Billy's anger gets the best of him, leading to a brawl in which Maureen is accidentally shot and killed by Miguel's brother Hector, who flees.

Billy begins abusing alcohol and drugs while obsessively searching for Hector. He eventually gets a tip about Hector's whereabouts but only finds Hector's drug-addicted wife Maria, and leaves after learning Hector is a father. Billy attacks a referee out of frustration after throwing a fight and is suspended for a year, leaving him with no income and a six figure fine for ref assault. Furthermore, the networks are suing him for breach of contract, leaving him indebted and his house and belongings being repossessed. He continues to spiral out of control and nearly dies after crashing his car in a suicide attempt; he loses custody of Leila as a result, and she is put under care of [[Child Protective Services]] officer Angela Rivera. The incident drives Billy to sober up, but Leila cuts ties with him, blaming him for their predicament.

At the behest of his friends, Billy gets a job as a cleaner at a gym owned by seasoned boxer Titus "Tick" Wills, and tries to convince Tick to become his trainer. Billy's former manager, Jordan Mains, who is currently managing Miguel, arranges a fight between the two that could put Billy back in the spotlight. Tick is reluctant to train Billy, fearful he might be blinded by his vendetta against Miguel, but is motivated to do so when another of his students, Hoppy, is killed by his abusive father while attempting to defend his mother.

Seeing Billy's hard work after securing a job and keeping it, and his ability to show responsibilities of a father, a judge removes his visitation restrictions and congratulates him for his good work. Billy then takes Leila to his apartment where they have breakfast together and Leila asks if she can attend the fight. Billy, reluctant to let his daughter go to the fight because Maureen never wanted to expose their daughter to the violence in boxing, says he is unsure because Maureen used to make all the decisions for him. Leila asks if they can go visit Maureen's grave, where Leila convinces Billy to let her go to the fight to have someone by his side. Billy tells Leila that there will be people at the fight saying some harsh things, so Leila makes an agreement to go to the fight but stay only in the locker room with Angela, watching the fight via closed circuit television in the locker room.

As the match begins, Miguel has the upper hand against Billy, but, with Tick's advice, Billy has the chance to turn the tables in the final round by using the [[Boxing styles and technique#Defense|Philly shell defense]] and countering more aggressively with his left. As the round reaches its final minute, Billy pivots hard and, although fighting from a traditional stance, delivers a powerful left uppercut which knocks the champion down to the ground. Miguel manages to get up before the count is over and is saved by the bell. Billy is declared the winner by a split-decision and reunites with Leila in the locker room, where she forgives his past mistakes and they embrace.

==Production==
[[Eminem]] was originally supposed to play the role of Billy Hope. The film's screenwriter [[Kurt Sutter]] said the project was inspired by the rapper's personal struggles. He stated that he had taken meetings with Eminem's producing partners over the past seven years, looking for something to do together. "I know he's very selective and doesn't do a lot. But he shared so much of his personal struggle in this raw and very honest album, one that I connected with on a lot of levels. He is very interested in the boxing genre, and it seemed like an apt metaphor, because his own life has been a brawl. In a way, this is a continuation of the ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'' story, but we are doing a metaphorical narrative of the second chapter of his life. He'll play a world champion boxer who really hits a hard bottom, and has to fight to win back his life for his young daughter. At its core, this is a retelling of his struggles over the last five years of his life, using the boxing analogy. I love that the title refers to Marshall being a lefty, which is to boxing what a white rapper is to hip hop; dangerous, unwanted, and completely unorthodox. It's a much harder road for a [[southpaw]] than a right-handed boxer."&lt;ref name="deadline5"/&gt; Producers Alan and Peter Riche have given a slightly different story about Eminem's involvement however stating that they set out to make a boxing movie similar to ''[[The Champ (1931 film)|The Champ]]'' but wanted to make the story about a father-daughter relationship as opposed to ''The Champ''{{'}}s father-son story.&lt;ref name="BI"/&gt; Recalling Eminem's strong relationship with his daughter, they asked him and he was immediately receptive.&lt;ref name="BI"/&gt;

On December 13, 2010, [[DreamWorks]] acquired the script, with Eminem eyed to play the lead role,&lt;ref name="deadline5"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/12/dreamworks-teams-with-eminem-and-kurt-sutter-for-southpaw/ |title=DreamWorks Teams With Eminem And Kurt Sutter For 'Southpaw' |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the following August the studio dropped the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/eminem-antoine-fuqua-boxing-drama-southpaw-dropped-by-dreamworks-but-still-seeking-to-answer-bell/ |title=Eminem-Antoine Fuqua Boxing Drama 'Southpaw' Dropped By DreamWorks But Still Seeking To Answer Bell |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=2011-08-11 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] picked up the film that October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jeff Sneider |url=https://variety.com/2011/film/news/mgm-closes-eminem-pic-southpaw-1118044796/ |title=MGM closes Eminem pic ‘Southpaw’ |publisher=Variety |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2012, Eminem dropped out of the film to focus instead on his music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eminems-second-movie-put-on-hold-20120510 |title=Eminem delays second movie, 'Southpaw' to focus on music. |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2012-05-10 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoine Fuqua]] signed on to the project in March 2014 with [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] replacing Eminem.&lt;ref name="deadline1"/&gt; Other casting news was announced in May 2014 with [[Forest Whitaker]], [[Lupita Nyong'o]], and [[Rachel McAdams]] officially joining the cast.&lt;ref name="deadline2"/&gt; In August of that year, it was announced that [[Naomie Harris]] would be replacing Nyong'o.&lt;ref name="deadline6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yamato |first=Jen |url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/08/naomie-harris-jake-gyllenhaal-southpaw/ |title=Naomie Harris Joins Jake Gyllenhaal In 'Southpaw' |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gyllenhaal did research for his role by doing "tons of reading on boxers, orphan boxers, the spirit of gyms all over America, children who start early, [and] the history of [[foster care]] in America"&lt;ref name="huffington research"/&gt; while also spending five months training as a boxer.&lt;ref name="huffington research"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Matthew|title=With ‘Southpaw,’ Jake Gyllenhaal’s Physical Transformations Become A One-Two Punch|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jake-gyllenhaal-southpaw_us_55ae83dde4b07af29d567e26|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eminem would later praise Gyllenhaal's performance, noting that "Jake smashed it" in an interview with [[Zane Lowe]].&lt;ref name="BI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guerrasio|first1=Jason|title=New movie 'Southpaw' was created for Eminem — but here's why the role ended up going to Jake Gyllenhaal|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/southpaw-eminem-jake-gyllenhaal-casting-2015-7|website=Business Insider|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a rating of 60%, based on 222 reviews, with a [[Weighted arithmetic mean|rating average]] of 6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Jake Gyllenhaal delivers an impressively committed performance, but ''Southpaw'' beats it down with a dispiriting drama that pummels viewers with genre clichés."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/southpaw_2015/|title=Southpaw|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=February 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 57 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/southpaw-2015 | title=Southpaw | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] | accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[CinemaScore]], audiences gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2015/07/pixels-paper-towns-southpaw-trainwreck-ant-man-box-office-1201484974/|title=‘Ant-Man’ Has Bragging Rights At The B.O.

Soren Anderson of ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying "''Southpaw'', a boxing movie with a theme of redemption, is redeemed by the performances of its two main actors, Jake Gyllenhaal and Forest Whitaker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andersen |first=Soren |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/southpaw-hokey-boxing-film-has-fine-acting-in-its-corner/ |title=‘Southpaw’: Hokey boxing film has fine acting in its corner |publisher=The Seattle Times |date=2015-07-23 |accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyle Smith of the ''[[New York Post]]'' gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying "It brings back every stale genre convention you can think of, then hopes you won't recognize predictability pumped up with swearing and steroids and an Eminem song during the training montage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Kyle |url=https://nypost.com/2015/07/23/jake-gyllenhaals-southpaw-is-a-stale-cliche-filled-fight/ |title=Jake Gyllenhaal’s ‘Southpaw’ is a stale, cliche-filled fight &amp;#124; New York Post |publisher=Nypost.com |date=2015-07-23 |accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ty Burr of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' gave the film two and a half stars out of four, saying "This is a genre with especially sturdy bones, and when ''Southpaw'' connects, which is more often than you might expect, you feel it down to your toes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/movies/2015/07/23/southpaw-old-two-punch/5bdZfJeFAj1kzPAgtdiVeO/story.html |title=In ‘Southpaw,’ it’s the old 0ne-two punch - Movies |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=2015-07-23 |accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Hornaday of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying "''Southpaw'' may be rote, predictable and mawkish, but none of those faults lie in its star.

O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "I wish I could say ''Southpaw'' was a knockout, or even a contender, that it went the distance or scored on points.

September 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Nashawaty of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a C+, saying "Just as director Antoine Fuqua starts to close in on something interesting and unexpected, he retreats to the safety of his corner and gives us what we've seen too many times before: a predictable flurry of melodramatic jabs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nashawaty |first=Chris |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/23/southpaw-ew-review |title='Southpaw': EW review |publisher=EW.com |date= 2015-07-22|accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara VanDenburgh of ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' gave the film three out of five stars, saying "''Southpaw'' is all about the fist. There's no delicate footwork here, no lingering grace notes. It's a film played entirely in power chords."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/entertainment/movies/2015/07/23/review-southpaw-packs-little-punch/30434849/ |title=Review: ‘Southpaw’ packs too little punch |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2015-07-23 |accessdate=2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] of ''[[ReelViews]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, saying "''Southpaw'' isn't content with presenting a gallery of clichéd characters.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7183">The '''Symphony in C major''', [[Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis|WWV]] 29, is the only completed [[symphony]] of [[Richard Wagner]].

== Form ==
The Symphony in C major is in four [[movement (music)|movements]]:
* I. Sostenuto e maestoso - Allegro con brio (475 [[bar (music)|bars]])
* II. Andante ma non troppo, un poco maestoso (208 bars)
* III. Allegro assai (447 bars)
* IV. Allegro molto e vivace. (442 bars).

The performance time is approximately 35 minutes.

The first movement is in [[sonata form]] movement prefaced by a slow introduction. The second movement is in the key of A minor; the overall shape is A + B + B + A + [[coda (music)|coda]], a strong contrast existing between the lyrical A and the signal-like B ideas. The movement begins with a motif from the coda of the first movement. The third movement is a [[scherzo]] and [[Trio (music)#Musical form|trio]] with the traditional structure A + B + A + B + A + coda. The scherzo is characterised by a dynamic rhythm, whilst the trio (''un poco meno allegro'') features a contrasting smooth melodic line. The fourth movement is structured in the same classical sonata form as the opening movement. The idea which follows the presentation of the first theme is equivocal in [[tonality]]. Wagner accelerates the tempo (''più allegro'') half way through the coda to generate increased excitement as the music moves towards its close.

== Instrumentation ==
The symphony is scored for 2 [[flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s in C, 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], 4 [[French horn|horns]] in C, 2 [[trumpet]]s in C, 3 [[trombone]]s, [[timpani]] and [[String section|strings]].

== Composition ==
According to Wagner himself, in a letter to a friend, he composed the symphony in the brief space of six weeks at the beginning of the summer of 1832. The composition shows the influence of the symphonies of Beethoven (especially nos. 3, 5 and 7) and also of the late symphonies of Mozart.&lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 309.&lt;/ref&gt; The orchestration is in the style of [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]. The work shows the composer's inexperience (he was less than 20 years old when writing it), in particular in a so-called diffuseness of the first and second movements.&lt;ref&gt;Overbeeke (2012) 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|reason=one persons opinion|date=December 2017}}

Wagner also started in 1834 an incomplete symphony in E major (WWV35), of which only the first movement and part of the second movement exist.&lt;ref&gt;Millington (2001) 310.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early performances==
The symphony was performed in rehearsal by a student orchestra at the [[Prague Conservatory]] in November 1832, conducted by [[Bedřich Diviš Weber|Dionys Weber]], with Wagner in attendance.  It received its first public performance on 15 December, at the ''Euterpe'' music society in [[Leipzig]], conducted by Wagner's early teacher, Christian Gottlieb Müller.&lt;ref name="Deathridge 2008 180"&gt;Deathridge (2008) 180&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clara Schumann|Clara Wieck]] described the performance in a letter to her later husband [[Robert Schumann]] dated 17 December 1832:
:"Father  [ [[Friedrich Wieck]] ] went to the Euterpe hall on Saturday. Listen! Herr Wagner has got ahead of you; a symphony of his was performed, which is said to be as like as two peas to [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven's]] [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Symphony in A major]]."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Newman (1976) 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second public performance was at the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus]] on 10 January 1833, as part of the annual subscription concerts.&lt;ref name="Deathridge 2008 180"/&gt; The work received another performance at [[Würzburg]] on 27 August 1833.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed., 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

The score was subsequently thought to have been lost after Wagner presented it to [[Felix Mendelssohn]] in 1836 (see below), but the parts from the Prague performance were found in [[Dresden]] in 1877 in a trunk which had been left behind by Wagner when he fled the city in 1849. The work was performed again at Christmas 1882, two months before Wagner's death, for the birthday of Wagner's wife [[Cosima Wagner|Cosima]] at the [[La Fenice]] theatre  [[Venice]]; it was conducted by Wagner and by [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]].&lt;ref name="Newman 1976, 96, n"&gt;Newman (1976), 96, n.&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner made several revisions to the full score for the performance.&lt;ref&gt;Overbeeke (2012) 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent  "Essay on the Revival of Youthful Works" he wrote: "If there is anything at all in this work which shows the mark of Richard Wagner, it is the fact that it is not polluted by the hypocritical stance which was to appear later and which Germans find very difficult to get the better of, and the fact that, from the outset, he remained true to himself and was unwilling to be deflected from his proper course."

==Mendelssohn and Wagner's Symphony==
The same 1882 essay contains a passage in which Wagner implies that Mendelssohn had tried to deliberately suppress the Symphony.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Deathridge (2008), 181.&lt;/ref&gt; The score had in fact been given by Wagner to Mendelssohn as a gift, as is demonstrable from a letter written by Wagner on 11 April 1836; Wagner perhaps had a grievance that Mendelssohn had not subsequently conducted it.&lt;ref&gt;Newman (1976), 95 n.2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 Wagner told Cosima that he thought Mendelssohn had destroyed the score "perhaps because he detected in it a talent which was disagreeable to him."&lt;ref name="Newman 1976, 96, n"/&gt; This invention was of a piece with Wagner's [[antisemitic]] attitude to Mendelssohn.&lt;ref&gt;Deathridge (2008), 182-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Piano duet version==
Fragments exist of a [[piano duet]] version of the Symphony in Wagner's hand, probably prepared in 1832 or 1833.

'''''The Death of Captain James Cook, 14 February 1779''''' is a painting by [[Johann Zoffany]]. The painting records the loss of the British explorer [[James Cook|Captain James Cook]]. The painting was completed in 1794 some years after the death of Cook in 1779. Other paintings of [[Death of Cook|the death of Cook]] were painted earlier. The [[Mahiole]] (Feathered Helmet) that was included in the painting of Cook's death by Zoffany is said to be the helmet given to Cook when he first landed in Hawaii.&lt;ref name=ak/&gt;

==The painting's construction==
The painting is unfinished. Zoffany is thought to have based the painting on another made of Cook's death by [[John Webber]] who was the official artist on Cook's third voyage. Zoffany had been invited at one time to be an artist on one of Cook's voyages and it is thought that he may have previously painted Cook. Webber had not witnessed the death of Cook, but he would have known many of the people involved. He would have known the English sailors but he would also have seen many of the natives. When Cook and his men visited Hawaii for the second time they spent some time on the main island of Hawaii where he had been received many gifts from the Hawaiian Chief including a [[Feather cloak|feather cape]] and [[Mahiole|feathered helmet]]. Cook had been killed when he returned to Hawaii only two weeks after his second visit. His unplanned return to the island was due to a storm. Cook angered the native people by attempting to take the local chief, [[Kalaniʻōpuʻu]], as a hostage in order to get a missing boat returned. In the confusion, Cook shot a man and in the aftermath he and four marines were speared to death; the death appears unintended. Cook's replacement, Captain Clerke, was able to very quickly reestablish a relationship with the Hawaiians, and they left with little ill will.

Besides Webber's painting, Zoffany also took poses from [[Benjamin West]]'s ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]''. The native figure is based on the classical sculpture of the [[Discobolus]] which Zoffany knew well, and included in his painting ''[[Charles Townley|Charles Townley in the Park St. Gallery]]''. Cook's pose derives from the  ''[[Dying Gaul]]'', another very famous classical statue.&lt;ref name=zoff/&gt; The Hawaiian helmet that was included in the painting had been borrowed from a London museum and had belonged to Cook. It was the helmet given to Cook by a Hawaiian chief on his first visit to Hawaii in 1778.&lt;ref name=ak/&gt; The helmet is also reminiscent of a crested [[Ancient Greek]] helmet.&lt;ref name=zoff/&gt;

The painting's noble depictions of the natives' behaviour ignored reported details that the natives cannibalized some of Cook's body. Some of his bones were returned, but other parts of his body were kept and displayed by the islanders.&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/6834744/James-Cook-and-the-Exploration-of-the-Pacific-by-Adrienne-Kaeppler-and-Robert-Fleck-review.html James Cook and the Exploration of the Pacific by Adrienne Kaeppler and Robert Fleck: review], Philip Hoare, Daily Telegraph, 20 December 2009, accessed 18 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Johann Zoffany was a German-born painter who had become a successful portrait painter in London. Among his principal patrons were the royal family. [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte]] had sent Zoffany to [[Florence]] where he had agreed to paint the ''[[Tribuna of the Uffizi (painting)|Tribuna of the Uffizi]]''.&lt;ref name=royal&gt;[http://www.royalcollection.org.uk/eGallery/object.asp?object=406983&amp;row=0&amp;detail=about Tribuna of the Uffizi], Royal Collection, accessed April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Zoffany stayed seven years and the resulting painting was not well received.

Zoffany had to leave the country and he never again got a royal commission.&lt;ref name=royal/&gt; He had hoped to sail with [[Captain Cook]], but as a second choice he elected to make the long journey to [[Lucknow]] where he painted the life in colonial India.&lt;ref name=art&gt;[http://www.illwa.org/chapter_4.htm Indian Life and Landscapes by Western Artists] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327213724/http://www.illwa.org/chapter_4.htm |date=2010-03-27 }}, Pauline Rohatgi ''et al.'', Chapter 4, accessed April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst Zoffany was in India he worked with [[William Hodges]]. The construction of this painting is said to be based on a sketch by Hodges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/johnzoffanyrahis00zoffuoft/johnzoffanyrahis00zoffuoft_djvu.txt John Zoffany, R.A. his life and works : 1735-1810], Lady Manners and J.J.Williamson, p.40, accessed 18 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoffany went to see a play at [[Covent Garden]] concerning the death of [[Captain Cook]] who had been killed in [[Hawaii]] on his third voyage to find the [[North-West Passage]] in 1779.&lt;ref name=zoff&gt;[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/explore/object.cfm?ID=BHC0424 The death of Captain James Cook, 14 February 1779], National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London, accessed 18 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This is thought to have inspired him to paint the death of Cook at the hand of the Hawaiian natives. Cook had been given a [[mahiole]] (feathered helmet) and a [[feather cloak]] which was given to the [[Leverian Museum]]. Zoffany borrowed these as props for the construction of the painting which was not intended to be accurate and included poses that were taken from classic statues. This helmet remained in [[Sir Ashton Lever]]'s collection, which was originally housed in [[Leicester Square]]. The feathered helmet that had been given to Cook and included in this painting is now in a museum in Vienna.

When Cook visited Hawaii for the first time in January 1778. Cook was received by high chief [[Kalaniʻōpuʻu]]. Kalaniʻōpuʻu had with him six feather cloaks and a helmet. At the end of the meeting Cook was given the helmet and cloak that Kalaniʻōpuʻu had been wearing. On the expedition's return much of Cook's collection was exhibited in the [[Leverian Museum]].&lt;ref name=ak&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/audio/transcripts/cook/NMA_Kaeppler_20060728.html To attempt some new discoveries in that vast unknown tract], [[Adrienne Kaeppler]] Smithsonian Museum of Natural History, Washington DC.
Cook’s Pacific Encounters symposium, National Museum of Australia, 28 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Lever's collection was then disposed of by public lottery, was obtained by [[James Parkinson (1730–1813)|James Parkinson]], and was exhibited in the [[Blackfriars Rotunda]]. He eventually sold this collection in 7,000 separate lots, in 1806. The [[British Museum]] failed to bid on these items as Sir [[Joseph Banks]] had advised them that there was nothing of value.&lt;ref name=ak/&gt; Many items were purchased by [[Leopold von Fichtel|Baron Leopold von Fichtel]] for the museum in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Page:Ibis - Series 3 - Volume 3.djvu/36|The Ibis, Series 3, Volume 3]], Osbert Salvin, 1873, accessed 29 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Zoffany's painting was obtained in its unfinished state by Cook's widow. When she died in 1835 the painting was not mentioned specifically and it was left to [[John Leach Bennet]] who gave it to [[Greenwich Hospital (London)|Greenwich Hospital]]. The painting is now in the collection of the [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[Greenwich]], London.&lt;ref name=zoff/&gt;

The painting depicts [[Hera]] ([[Juno (mythology)|Juno]]), spilling her [[breast milk]], the infant [[Heracles]] ([[Hercules]]) and [[Zeus]] ([[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]) in the background, identifiable by his eagle and lightning bolts. Hera's face is modelled on Rubens' wife, [[Hélène Fourment]].&lt;ref name="prado"/&gt; The carriage is pulled by Hera's favourite animals, peacocks. Due to the dark background of the night sky the figures gain a greater sense of volume.

The image was a part of the commission from [[Philip IV of Spain]] to decorate [[Torre de la Parada]]. Rubens also painted other Greco-Roman mythological subjects, such as ''Hercules Fighting the Nemean Lion'' or ''[[Perseus Freeing Andromeda (Rubens)|Perseus Freeing Andromeda]]''.

'''''The Voyage of Life''''' is a series of paintings created by [[Thomas Cole]] in 1842, representing an [[allegory]] of the four stages of human life: childhood, youth, manhood, and old age. The paintings depict a voyager who travels in a boat on a river through the mid-19th-century American wilderness.  In each painting the voyager rides the boat on the River of Life accompanied by a [[Guardian angel (spirit)|guardian angel]]. The landscape, each reflecting one of the four [[season|seasons of the year]], plays a major role in conveying the story. With each installment the boat's direction of travel is reversed from the previous picture. In childhood, the infant glides from a dark cave into a rich, green landscape. As a youth, the boy takes control of the boat and aims for a shining castle in the sky. In manhood, the adult relies on prayer and religious faith to sustain him through rough waters and a threatening landscape. Finally, the man becomes old and the angel guides him to heaven across the waters of [[eternity]].

==Background==
Thomas Cole is regarded as the founder of the [[Hudson River School]], an [[Visual arts of the United States|American art]] movement that flourished in the mid-19th century and was concerned with the realistic and detailed portrayal of nature but with a strong influence from [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/125174/Thomas-Cole Encyclopædia Britannica] Retrieved December 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This group of American landscape painters worked between about 1825 and 1870 and shared a sense of national pride as well as an interest in celebrating the unique natural beauty found in the [[United States]]. The wild, untamed nature found in America was viewed as its special character; Europe had ancient ruins, but America had the uncharted wilderness. As Cole's friend [[William Cullen Bryant]] sermonized in verse, so Cole sermonized in paint. Both men saw nature as God's work and as a refuge from the ugly materialism of cities. Cole clearly intended ''The Voyage of Life'' to be a didactic, moralizing series of paintings using the landscape as an allegory for religious faith.

Unlike Cole's first major series, ''[[The Course of Empire (paintings)|The Course of Empire]]'', which focused on the stages of civilization as a whole, ''The Voyage of Life'' series is a more personal, [[Christian]] allegory that interprets visually the journey of man through four stages of life: infancy, youth, manhood and old age. Done on [[Contract|commission]], the finished works generated a disagreement with the owner about a public exhibition. In 1842, when Cole was in Rome, he did a second set of the series which on his return to America was shown to acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The first set is at the [[Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute]] in [[Utica, New York]], and the second set is at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

In the first painting, ''Childhood'', all the important story elements of the series are introduced: the voyager, the angel, the river, and the expressive landscape. An infant is safely ensconced in a boat guided by an angel. The landscape is lush; everything is calm and basking in warm sunshine, reflecting the innocence and joy of childhood. The boat glides out of a dark, craggy cave which Cole himself described as "emblematic of our earthly origin, and the mysterious Past."&lt;ref name="p1990"&gt;{{harvnb|Powell|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river is smooth and narrow, symbolizing the sheltered experience of childhood. The figurehead on the prow holds an hourglass representing [[time]].

The second painting, ''Youth'', shows the same rich, green landscape, but here the view widens as does the voyager's experience. Now the youth grabs the [[tiller]] firmly as the angel watches and waves from the shore, allowing him to take control. The boy's enthusiasm and energy is evident in his forward-thrusting pose and billowing clothes. In the distance, a ghostly castle hovers in the sky, a white and shimmering beacon that represents the ambitions and dreams of man.

[[File:Detail, Voyage of Life, Youth. Thomas Cole..JPG|thumb|left|Detail of Thomas Cole's ''The Voyage of Life: Youth'': shows the boy departing in the boat; the angel bids him farewell from the shore.]]
To the youth, the calm river seems to lead straight to the castle, but at the far right of the painting one can just glimpse the river as it becomes rough, choppy, and full of rocks. Cole comments on the landscape and the youth's ambitions: "The scenery of the picture—its clear stream, its lofty trees, its towering mountains, its unbounded distance, and transparent atmosphere—figure forth the romantic beauty of youthful imaginings, when the mind elevates the Mean and Common into the Magnificent, before experience teaches what is the Real."

===''Manhood''===
{{Infobox Artwork

}}
Cole's renowned four-part series traces the journey of an archetypal hero along the "River of Life." Confidently assuming control of his destiny and oblivious to the dangers that await him, the voyager boldly strives to reach an aerial castle, emblematic of the daydreams of "Youth" and its aspirations for glory and fame. As the traveler approaches his goal, the ever more turbulent stream deviates from its course and relentlessly carries him toward the next picture in the series, where nature's fury, evil demons, and self-doubt will threaten his very existence. Only prayer, Cole suggests, can save the voyager from a dark and tragic fate.

From the innocence of childhood, to the flush of youthful overconfidence, through the trials and tribulations of middle age, to the hero's triumphant salvation, ''The Voyage of Life'' seems intrinsically linked to the Christian doctrine of death and resurrection. Cole's intrepid voyager also may be read as a personification of America, itself at an adolescent stage of development. The artist may have been issuing a dire warning to those caught up in the feverish quest for Manifest Destiny: that unbridled westward expansion and industrialization would have tragic consequences for both man and the land itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cole|first=Thomas|title=The Voyage of Life: Manhood|date=1842|url=https://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.52452.html|accessdate=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Old Age'' ===

The final painting, ''Old Age'', is an image of [[death]]. The man has grown old; he has survived the trials of life. The waters have calmed; the river flows into the waters of eternity. The figurehead and hourglass are missing from the battered boat; the withered old voyager has reached the end of earthly time. In the distance, angels are descending from heaven, while the guardian angel hovers close, gesturing toward the others. The man is once again joyous with the knowledge that faith has sustained him through life. The landscape is practically gone, just a few rough rocks represent the edge of the earthly world, and dark water stretches onward. Cole describes the scene: "The chains of corporeal existence are falling away; and already the mind has glimpses of Immortal Life."

==Cultural significance==
''The Voyage of Life'' was well received by critics and the public; the United States was experiencing the [[Christian revival|religious revival]] sometimes known as the [[Second Great Awakening]]. The four paintings were converted to engravings by [[James Smillie (engraver)|James Smillie]] (1807–85) after Cole's death and the engravings widely distributed in time for the [[Third Great Awakening]], giving the series the prestige and popular acclaim it retains today.&lt;ref name="p1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Powell|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Vestoj''''' (meaning "clothing" in [[Esperanto]]) is an annual [[academic journal]] about [[dress]] and [[fashion]]. The [[editor-in-chief]] and publisher is Anja Aronowsky Cronberg.

==History==
''Vestoj – the Journal of Sartorial Matters'' was established by [[editor-in-chief]] and publisher Anja Aronowsky Cronberg in 2009. It sets out to "combine theoretical knowledge about fashion with experience from the fashion industry. In the first issue a manifesto was formulated that more than anything was about bridging the gap between fashion as an academic subject of study and fashion as a business".&lt;ref&gt;Falk, Karin, Det Svenska Modeundret, Norstedts, Stockholm, 2011, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; It "stands apart from the current crop of new magazines because of its consciously intellectual stance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ualresearchonline.arts.ac.uk/3799/ |title=Here is the secret, here is the trick |author=O'Neill, Alistair |work=UAL Research Online |accessdate=2013-06-25 |date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vestoj'' combines scholarly texts about fashion with [[fiction]], [[nonfiction]], [[poetry]], and [[visual arts|visuals]]. Each issue is thematic and its subject matter is reflected in both editorial content and art direction. Every issue consequently has a different logo, style, format, and graphic design. In contrast to the majority of [[list of fashion magazines|fashion magazines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=David|first1=Alison Matthews|title=''Vogue's'' New World: American Fashionability and the Politics of Style|journal=Fashion Theory|date=21 April 2015|volume=10|issue=1-2|pages=13–38|doi=10.2752/136270406778051049}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vestoj'' contains no advertising and does not revolve around the fashion seasonal calendar.

==Reception==
''Vestoj'' has been called "one of the most successful attempts to provide the young academic discipline fashion studies with an equivalent to, say, the medical journal ''The Lancet''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidbloggen.se/2009/11/24/vestoj-allvarligt-talat-om-mode-pa-esperanto/ |title=Vestoj: Allvarligt talat.

Och engelska |work=Sidbloggen |author=Wirfält, Johan |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2013-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110053031/http://www.sidbloggen.se/2009/11/24/vestoj-allvarligt-talat-om-mode-pa-esperanto/ |archivedate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and journalist [[Fredrik Strage]] labelled ''Vestoj'''s first issue as one of the best new magazines in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sidbloggen.se/titlar/vestoj/ |title=Vestoj |author=Strage, Fredrik |work=Sidbloggen |accessdate=2013-06-25 |date=2010-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302042016/http://www.sidbloggen.se/titlar/vestoj/ |archivedate=March 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal was also described as a publication that "connects intellectual strength and aesthetic refinement"&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anothermag.com/current/view/1384/Anja_Aronowsky-Cronberg |title=An Intellectual Fashion - Anja Aronowsky-Cronberg |author=Grau, Donatien |work=AnOther |accessdate=2013-06-25 |date=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' said that "flicking through ''Vestoj'' gives rise to the same feeling of pleasure that enjoying an old 1950s issue of ''Reader's Digest'': it's engaging, charming, personal and tongue in cheek – without ever compromising the [[intellectual]] quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.svd.se/kultur/mode-de-nya-tidningarna_4852911.svd |title=Mode - de nya tidningarna &amp;#124; Kultur |authorlink=Karin Ström |author=Ström, Karin |work=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |accessdate=2013-06-25 |date=2010-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview on AnOthermag.com, Aronowsky Cronberg explains her approach, stating that ''Vestoj'' aims to have "an intelligent and multi-facetted approach to sartorial matters. What I find the most interesting methodology is the one that deals with both the production and consumption of a garment, as well as with the analysis of it. […] Through the study of fashion you can understand any given point in history, our desires, ideals, wants and needs. The aspect of fashion that deals with voracious consumption has spread into every way we relate to [[culture]]; today we consume ideas, knowledge and people as much as we consume goods. Fashion in that sense is nothing short of a Gesamtkunstwerk." &lt;ref name=interview /&gt;

The Kentucky '''Women Writers Conference''' had its beginnings in 1979&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Food writer Ruth Reichl will speak at Kentucky Women Writers Conference|url=http://www.kentucky.com/2011/12/10/1989169/food-writer-ruth-reichle-will.html|newspaper=Lexington Herald-Leader|date=December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a celebration of women writers at the [[University of Kentucky]] (UK). That first year featured [[Maya Angelou]], [[Toni Cade Bambara]], [[Ruth Stone]], [[Alice Walker]], and [[Ruth Whitman]]. Since then, it has become the longest-running annual festival of women writers in the nation, showcasing the talents and issues addressed by established and emerging authors.

UK History faculty Nancy Dye had suggested using surplus funds from Undergraduate Studies to bring women writers to campus. A 16-member committee from the departments of English, Honors, Undergraduate Studies, and Special Collections, along with members of the Lexington community, produced the conference. In 1984–1985 the conference was directed by UK English faculty Jane Gentry Vance, who later served as Kentucky's Poet Laureate.

In 1985–1993, the conference was affiliated with Continuing Education for Women/University Extension and directed by Betty Gabehart. As the conference's longest-running director, Gabehart made significant contributions to its enduring legacy and stability, establishing much of the reputation it enjoys today. In 1994–1996, the conference was affiliated with the Women's Studies Program and directed by Jan Oaks, faculty in English and Gender and Women's Studies. In 1997, former Conference assistant Patti DeYoung served as director.

In 1998 the conference lost university funding when it was unable to find a sponsoring department, and its advisory board established itself as a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization. Its new home became the Carnegie Center for Literacy and Learning in downtown Lexington, and it was renamed the Kentucky Women Writers Conference. Its director during those years, 1998–2002, was Jan Isenhour, also director of the Carnegie Center, and its work was carried out by a volunteer board.

In 2002 President Lee Todd reinstated support for the conference to demonstrate the university's commitment to women's programming and community events. Since then, the Conference leadership has continued cultivating wide community support through many partnerships and the committed efforts of its board and volunteers. UK provides staff salaries, office space, and the majority of KWWC's operating expenses. Financial support from the [[Kentucky Foundation for Women]], LexArts, the Kentucky Arts Council, the [[Kentucky Humanities Council]], businesses, and individual patrons remains critical to our ability to attract writers of the highest caliber.

Directors since then have been Brenda Weber (2003) and Rebecca Gayle Howell (2004–06). Howell launched several free community events that have become signature offerings of the conference, including the Gypsy Slam, the [[Sonia Sanchez]] Series, and the Hardwick/Jones keynote reading on mentorship and collaboration. In 2007, Julie Kuzneski Wrinn became Conference director. The 38th annual conference will be held September 15-16, 2017 in Lexington, Kentucky.

'''Woodrow Wilson Guthrie''' ({{IPAc-en|'|g|V|T|r|i|}}; July 14, 1912&amp;nbsp;– October 3, 1967) was an American [[singer-songwriter]], one of the most significant figures in American [[folk music]]; his music, including songs, such as "[[This Land Is Your Land]]", has inspired several generations both politically and musically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kenburns/dustbowl/bios/woody-guthrie/|work=pbs.org|title=Woody Guthrie: Journalist, Musician (1912-1967)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/woody-guthrie-9323949|work=biography.com|title=Woody Guthrie Biography.com: Guitarist, Songwriter, Singer(1912–1967)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/woody-guthrie-mn0000577531/biography|work=allmusic.com|title=Woody Guthrie|author=William Ruhlmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote hundreds of political, folk, and [[children's music|children's]] songs, along with [[ballad]]s and improvised works.

He frequently performed with the slogan "[[This machine kills fascists]]" displayed on his guitar.

Guthrie was brought up by middle-class parents in [[Okemah, Oklahoma]],&lt;ref name="Ed Cray 2006 16"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qzmNhQ2lkAC&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=16|author=Ed Cray|date=2006|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W.

His father moved to [[Pampa, Texas]], to repay debts from unsuccessful real estate deals. During his early teens, Guthrie learned folk and blues songs from his parents' friends. He married at 19, but with the advent of the [[dust storms]] that marked the Dust Bowl period, he left his wife and three children to join the thousands of [[Okies]] who were migrating to California looking for employment. He worked at Los Angeles radio station [[KFVD]], achieving some fame from playing [[Hillbilly#Music|hillbilly music]]; made friends with [[Will Geer]] and [[John Steinbeck]]; and wrote a column for the [[Communist]] newspaper ''[[People's World]]'' from May 1939 to January 1940.

Throughout his life, Guthrie was associated with [[CPUSA|United States Communist]] groups, although he did not appear to be a member of any.&lt;ref name="Spivey"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loyno.edu/history/journal/1996-7/Spivey.html |title=This Land is Your land, This Land is My Land: Folk Music, Communism, and the Red Scare as a Part of the American Landscape |publisher=''Student Historical Journal'' 1996–1997, Loyola University New Orleans, 1996 |author=Christine A.

He left the station, ending up in New York where he wrote and recorded his 1940 album ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]'', based on his experiences during the 1930s, which earned him the nickname the "Dust Bowl Troubadour".&lt;ref&gt;Alarik, Scott.

Guthrie was married three times and fathered eight children. His son [[Arlo Guthrie]] became nationally known as a musician. Guthrie died in 1967 from complications of Huntington's disease. His first two daughters also died of the disease. During his later years, in spite of his illness, Guthrie served as a figurehead in the [[Contemporary folk music|folk movement]], providing inspiration to a generation of new folk musicians, including mentoring [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]] and [[Bob Dylan]].

Guthrie was born 14 July 1912 in [[Okemah, Oklahoma|Okemah]], a small town in [[Okfuskee County, Oklahoma]], the son of Nora Belle (née Sherman) and Charles Edward Guthrie.&lt;ref name="Reitwiesner"&gt;Reitwiesner, William Addams.

Three significant fires occurred during Guthrie's early life, one that caused the loss of his family's home in Okemah.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} When Guthrie was seven, his sister Clara died after setting her clothes on fire during an argument with her mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8qzmNhQ2lkAC&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=18|author=Ed Cray|date=2006|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W.

What they could see was [[dementia]] and muscular degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&amp;nbsp;26,&amp;nbsp;32,&amp;nbsp;39&lt;/ref&gt;

When Woody was 14, she was committed to the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane. At the time his father Charley was living and working in [[Pampa, Texas]], to repay debts from unsuccessful real estate deals. Woody and his siblings were on their own in Oklahoma; they relied on their eldest brother Roy for support. The 14-year-old Woody Guthrie worked odd jobs around Okemah, begging meals and sometimes sleeping at the homes of family friends.

Guthrie had a natural affinity for music, learning old ballads and traditional English and Scottish songs from the parents of friends.&lt;ref name=Clay28/&gt; Guthrie befriended an African-American [[Shoeshiner|shoeshine boy]] named "George", who played blues on his harmonica. After listening to George play, Guthrie bought his own harmonica and began playing along with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Common Ground|title=Ear Players|last=Guthrie|first=Woody|date=1942|issue=Spring|page=32|url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/CommonGround-1942q1-00032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie's interview with [[Alan Lomax]] at the [[Library of Congress]] Recording Sessions, as recorded in Cray, ''Ramblin Man,'' p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt; He used to busk for money and food.&lt;ref name=Clay28&gt;{{cite book|page=28|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Guthrie did not do well as a student and dropped out of high school in his senior year before graduation, his teachers described him as bright. He was an avid reader on a wide range of topics.&lt;ref name=Clay44&gt;{{cite book|page=44|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, Guthrie's father sent for Woody to join him in Texas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guthrie, Woodrow Wilson (1912–1967)|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=GU006|publisher=Oklahoma Historical Society|accessdate=8 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but little changed for the aspiring musician. Guthrie, then 18, was reluctant to attend high school classes in Pampa; he spent most of his time learning songs by [[busking]] on the streets and reading in the library at Pampa's city hall. He regularly played at dances with his father's half-brother Jeff Guthrie, a fiddle player.&lt;ref name=Clay44/&gt; His mother died in 1930 of complications of Huntington's disease while still in the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane.

===1930s===

===Marriage and family===
At age&amp;nbsp;19, Guthrie met and married his first wife, Mary Jennings, in Texas in 1931. They had three children together:  Gwendolyn, Sue, and Bill.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie,'' p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlo.net/lineage.shtml Guthrie Family tree] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117010420/http://www.arlo.net/lineage.shtml |date=November 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bill died at age 23 of an automobile accident. Each daughter died of Huntington's disease at the age of 41, in the 1970s.

Guthrie and Mary divorced in 1940. He married twice more, to Marjorie Greenblatt (1945–53), and Anneke Van Kirkand (1953–56) having a total of eight children.

===California===
During the [[Dust Bowl]] period, Guthrie joined the thousands of [[Okies]] and others who migrated to California to look for work, leaving his wife and children in Texas. Many of his songs are concerned with the conditions faced by working-class people.

During the latter part of that decade, he achieved fame with radio partner [[Maxine "Lefty Lou" Crissman]] as a broadcast performer of commercial [[hillbilly]] music and traditional folk music.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;90–92,&amp;nbsp;103–12&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie was making enough money to send for his family to join him from Texas.  While appearing on the radio station [[KFVD]], owned by a populist-minded [[New Deal]] Democrat, [[Frank W. Burke]], Guthrie began to write and perform some of the protest songs that he eventually released on his album ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]]''.

While at KFVD, Guthrie met newscaster Ed Robbin. Robbin was impressed with a song Guthrie wrote about political activist [[Thomas Mooney]], wrongly convicted in a case that was a ''[[wikt:cause célèbre|cause célèbre]]'' of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=139|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robbin, who became Guthrie's political mentor, introduced Guthrie to socialists and Communists in Southern California, including [[Will Geer]]. (He introduced Guthrie to writer [[John Steinbeck]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaufman|first=William|title=Woody Guthrie:  American Radical|year=2011|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana|isbn=978-0252036026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robbin remained Guthrie's lifelong friend, and helped Guthrie book benefit performances in the Communist circles in Southern California.

Notwithstanding Guthrie's later claim that "the best thing that I did in 1936 was to sign up with the Communist Party",&lt;ref&gt;Woody Guthrie Archives. "My Constitution and Me" [http://woodyguthrie.org/ Woody Guthrie Archives Collection]. Manuscripts Box 7 Folder 23.1, Unavailable online, link to Woody Guthrie Archives website for contact information.&lt;/ref&gt; he was never a member of the Party. He was noted as a [[fellow traveler]]—an outsider who agreed with the platform of the party while avoiding party discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=151|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie wrote a column for the Communist newspaper, ''[[People's World]]''. The column, titled "Woody Sez", appeared a total of 174&amp;nbsp;times from May 1939 to January 1940. "Woody Sez" was not explicitly political, but was about current events as observed by Guthrie. He wrote the columns in an [[eye dialect|exaggerated hillbilly dialect]] and usually included a small comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=153|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; These columns were published posthumously as a collection after Guthrie's death.&lt;ref name="Spivey"/&gt; [[Steve Earle]] said of Guthrie, "I don't think of Woody Guthrie as a political writer. He was a writer who lived in very political times."&lt;ref&gt;Corn, David. [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20021104/corn/2 "Jerusalem Calling"], ''[[The Nation]],'' October 17, 2002. Retrieved on November 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of World War II and publicity about the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] the [[Soviet Union]] had signed with Germany in 1939, the owners of KFVD radio did not want its staff "spinning apologia" for the Soviet Union. It fired both Robbin and Guthrie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=160|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the daily radio show, Guthrie's employment chances declined, and he returned with his family to Pampa, Texas. Although Mary was happy to return to Texas, Guthrie preferred to accept Will Geer's invitation to [[New York City]] and headed east.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

===1940s: Building a legacy===

====New York City====
Arriving in New York, Guthrie, known as "the Oklahoma cowboy", was embraced by its folk music community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beachamjournal.com/journal/2014/07/woody-guthrie-was-born-102-years-old-today.html|title=After 102 Years, Woody Guthrie's Impact Still As Vital As Ever|website=Frank Beacham's Journal|access-date=2018-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=GU006|title=Guthrie, Woodrow Wilson {{!}} The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture|website=www.okhistory.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, he slept on a couch in [[Will Geer]]'s apartment. Guthrie made his first recordings—several hours of conversation and songs recorded by the folklorist [[Alan Lomax]] for the [[Library of Congress]]—as well as an album, ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]],'' for [[Victor Records]] in [[Camden, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=174|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Listen|filename=Woody Guthrie - This Land.ogg|title="This Land is Your Land"|description=Sample of Woody Guthrie's song, "This Land is Your Land"|format=[[Ogg]]}}

In February 1940 he wrote his most famous song, "[[This Land Is Your Land]]", as a response to what he felt was an overplaying of [[Irving Berlin]]'s "[[God Bless America]]" on the radio. Guthrie thought the lyrics were unrealistic and complacent.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie,'' p.&amp;nbsp;144.&lt;/ref&gt; He adapted the melody from an old gospel song, "Oh My Loving Brother", which had been adapted by the country group the [[Carter Family]] for their song "When The World's On Fire". Guthrie signed the manuscript with the comment, "All you can write is what you see."&lt;ref name="Ed Cray 2004 165"&gt;{{cite book|page=165|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the song was written in 1940, it was four years before he recorded it for [[Moses Asch]] in April 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie,'' p.&amp;nbsp;287.&lt;/ref&gt; Sheet music was produced and given to schools by [[Howie Richmond]] sometime later.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Klein, ''Woody Guthrie,'' p.&amp;nbsp;375.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1940 Guthrie was invited to play at a benefit hosted by the John Steinbeck Committee to Aid Farm Workers, to raise money for migrant workers. There he met the folksinger [[Pete Seeger]], and the two men became good friends.&lt;ref name="Ed Cray 2004 165"/&gt; Seeger accompanied Guthrie back to Texas to meet other members of the Guthrie family.  He recalled an awkward conversation with Mary Guthrie's mother, in which she asked for Seeger's help to persuade Guthrie to treat her daughter better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=188|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From April 1940 Guthrie and Seeger lived together in the Greenwich Village loft of sculptor [[Harold Ambellan]] and his fiancee. Guthrie had some success in New York at this time as a guest on [[CBS]]'s radio program ''Back Where I Come From'' and used his influence to get a spot on the show for his friend [[Lead Belly|Huddie "Lead Belly" Ledbetter]]. Ledbetter's Tenth Street apartment was a gathering spot for the musician circle in New York at the time, and Guthrie and Ledbetter were good friends, as they had busked together at bars in Harlem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=194–195|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1941 Seeger introduced Guthrie to his friend the poet [[Charles Olson]], then a junior editor at the fledgling magazine ''[[Common Ground (magazine)|Common Ground]]''. The meeting led to Guthrie writing the article "Ear Players" in the Spring 1942 issue of the magazine. The article marked Guthrie's debut as a published writer in the mainstream media.&lt;ref name="Cray2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ed Cray|title=Ramblin' Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5OnliWZY0gC&amp;pg=PA228|accessdate=January 30, 2013|date=March 17, 2006|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-32736-6|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1940 Guthrie was invited by the Model Tobacco Company to host their radio program ''Pipe Smoking Time''. Guthrie was paid $180 a week, an impressive salary in 1940.&lt;ref name=cray197&gt;{{cite book|page=197|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally making enough money to send regular payments back to Mary. He also brought her and the children to New York, where the family lived briefly in an apartment on [[Central Park West]]. The reunion represented Woody's desire to be a better father and husband. He said, "I have to set [sic] real hard to think of being a dad."&lt;ref name=cray197/&gt; Guthrie quit after the seventh broadcast, claiming he had begun to feel the show was too restrictive when he was told what to sing.&lt;ref name=Cray200&gt;{{cite book|page=200|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W.

W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choreographer [[Sophie Maslow]] developed ''[[Folksay]]'' as an elaborate mix of modern dance and ballet, which combined folk songs by Woody Guthrie with text from [[Carl Sandburg]]’s 1936 book-length poem [[The People, Yes]]. The premiere took place in March 1942 at the Humphrey-Weidman Studio Theatre in New York City. Guthrie provided live music for the performance, which featured Maslow and her New Dance Group.  Two-and-a-half years later, Maslow brought ''[[Folksay]]'' to early television under the direction of Leo Hurwitz.  The same group performed the ballet live in front of [[CBS]] TV cameras. The 30-minute broadcast aired on WCBW, the pioneer CBS television station in New York City (now [[WCBS-TV]]), from 8:15-8:45PM ET on November 24th, 1944.  Featured were Maslow and the New Dance Group, which included among others Jane Dudley, Pearl Primus, and William Bales.  Woody Guthrie and fellow folksinger Tony Kraber played guitar, sang songs, and read text from [[The People, Yes]].  The program received positive reviews and was performed on television over WCBW a second time in early 1945.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvobscurities.com/2016/10/tales-of-lost-tv-folksay&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pacific Northwest====
[[File:The Columbia.ogv|alt=A black-and-white image of a river|thumb|Video: In 1941 Guthrie wrote songs for ''The Columbia'', a documentary about the [[Columbia River]] released in 1949. Playing time 21:10.]]

In May 1941, after a brief stay in Los Angeles, Guthrie moved to [[Portland, Oregon]], in the [[Lents, Portland, Oregon|neighborhood of Lents]], on the promise of a job. [[Gunther von Fritsch]] was directing a documentary about the [[Bonneville Power Administration]]'s construction of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] on the [[Columbia River]], and needed a narrator. Alan Lomax had recommended Guthrie to narrate the film and sing songs onscreen. The original project was expected to take 12 months, but as filmmakers became worried about casting such a political figure, they minimized Guthrie's role. The [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] hired him for one month to write songs about the [[Columbia River]] and the construction of the federal dams for the documentary's soundtrack.  Guthrie toured the Columbia River and the Pacific Northwest. Guthrie said he "couldn't believe it, it's a paradise",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=209|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared to inspire him creatively. In one month Guthrie wrote 26 songs, including three of his most famous: "[[Roll On, Columbia, Roll On]]", "[[Pastures of Plenty]]", and "[[Grand Coulee Dam (song)|Grand Coulee Dam]]".&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&amp;nbsp;195, 196, 202, 205, 212&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving songs were released as ''[[The Columbia River Collection (Woody Guthrie Album)|Columbia River Songs]]''. The film "Columbia" was not completed until 1949 (see below). At the conclusion of the month in Oregon and Washington, Guthrie wanted to return to New York. Tired of the continual uprooting, Mary Guthrie told him to go without her and the children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=213|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Guthrie would see Mary again, once on a tour through Los Angeles with the Almanac Singers, it was essentially the end of their marriage. Divorce was difficult, since Mary was a member of the [[Catholic Church]], but she reluctantly agreed in December 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=266|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W.

====Almanac Singers====

[[Image:Woody Guthrie NYWTS.jpg|right|thumb|Woody Guthrie, 1943]]

Following the conclusion of his work in the Northwest, Guthrie corresponded with [[Pete Seeger]] about Seeger's newly formed folk-protest group, the [[Almanac Singers]]. Guthrie returned to New York with plans to tour the country as a member of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.192-93,195–231&lt;/ref&gt; The singers originally worked out of a loft in New York City hosting regular concerts called "[[hootenanny|hootenannies]]", a word Pete and Woody had picked up in their cross-country travels. The singers eventually outgrew the space and moved into the cooperative Almanac House in [[Greenwich Village]].

Initially Guthrie helped write and sing what the Almanac Singers termed "peace" songs; while the Nazi-Soviet Pact was in effect, until Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Communist line was that [[World War II]] was a capitalist fraud. After Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, the group wrote anti-fascist songs. The members of the Almanac Singers and residents of the Almanac House were a loosely defined group of musicians, though the core members included Guthrie, [[Pete Seeger]], [[Millard Lampell]] and [[Lee Hays]]. In keeping with common utopian ideals, meals, chores and rent at the Almanac House were shared. The Sunday hootenannies were good opportunities to collect donation money for rent. Songs written in the Almanac House had shared songwriting credits among all the members, although in the case of "[[Union Maid]]", members would later state that Guthrie wrote the song, ensuring that his children would receive residuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=220|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Almanac House, Guthrie added authenticity to their work, since he was a "real" working class Oklahoman. "There was the heart of America personified in Woody ... And for a New York Left that was primarily Jewish, first or second generation American, and was desperately trying to get Americanized, I think a figure like Woody was of great, great importance", a friend of the group, [[Irwin Silber]], would say.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=216|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woody routinely emphasized his working-class image, rejected songs he felt were not in the country blues vein he was familiar with, and rarely contributed to household chores. House member [[Sis Cunningham|Agnes "Sis" Cunningham]], another Okie, would later recall that Woody "loved people to think of him as a real working class person and not an intellectual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=231|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie contributed songwriting and authenticity in much the same capacity for Pete Seeger's post-Almanac Singers project ''[[People's Songs]]'', a newsletter and booking organization for labor singers, founded in 1945.&lt;ref name="PS1"&gt;People's Songs Inc. ''People's Songs Newsletter, Vol 1. No 1.''. 1945. [[Old Town School of Folk Music]] resource center collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Bound for Glory''====
Guthrie was a prolific writer, penning thousands of pages of unpublished poems and prose, many written while living in New York City. After a recording session with Alan Lomax, Lomax suggested Guthrie write an autobiography. Lomax thought Guthrie's descriptions of growing up were some of the best accounts he had read of American childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=201|author=Ed Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|publisher= W. W. Norton &amp; Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Guthrie met [[Marjorie Mazia]], a dancer in New York who would become his second wife. Mazia was an instructor at the prestigious [[Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance|Martha Graham Dance School]], where she was assisting [[Sophie Maslow]] with her piece ''Folksay''. Based on the folklore and poetry collected by [[Carl Sandburg]], ''Folksay'' included the adaptation of some of Guthrie's ''Dust Bowl Ballads'' for the dance.&lt;ref name=Cray200/&gt; Guthrie continued to write songs and began work on his autobiography. The end product, [[Bound for Glory (book)|''Bound for Glory'']], was completed with the patient editing assistance of Mazia and was first published by E.P. Dutton in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Amazon.com.

In 1944 Guthrie met [[Moses Asch|Moses "Moe" Asch]] of [[Folkways Records]], for whom he first recorded "This Land Is Your Land". Over the next few years, he recorded "[[Worried Man Blues]]", along with [[Woody Guthrie discography#1944 &amp; 1945, The Asch Recordings|hundreds of other songs]]. These recordings would later be released by Folkways and Stinson Records, which had joint distribution rights.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;417.&lt;/ref&gt; The Folkways recordings are available (through the [[Smithsonian Institution]] online shop); the most complete series of these sessions, culled from dates with Asch, is titled ''[[The Asch Recordings (Woody Guthrie Album)|The Asch Recordings]]''.

====World War II years====
Guthrie believed performing his anti-fascist songs and poems in the United States was the best use of his talents.

'''Labor for Victory:'''  In April 1942, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported that the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] (American Federation of Labor) and the [[Congress of Industrial Organizations]] (CIO) had agreed to a joint radio production, called ''Labor for Victory''.  NBC agreed to run the weekly segment as a "public service". The AFL and CIO presidents [[William Green (U.S. labor leader)|William Green]] and [[Philip Murray]] agreed to let their press chiefs, [[Philip Pearl]] and [[Len De Caux]], narrate on alternate weeks. The show ran on NBC radio on Saturdays 10:15–10:30 PM, starting on April 25, 1942.  ''Time'' wrote, "De Caux and Pearl hope to make the Labor for Victory program popular enough for an indefinite run, using labor news, name speakers and interviews with workmen. Labor partisanship, they promise, is out."&lt;ref&gt;

*'''Merchant Marine:'''  Guthrie lobbied the United States Army to accept him as a [[USO]] performer instead of conscripting him as a soldier in the draft.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} When Guthrie's attempts failed, his friends [[Cisco Houston]] and Jim Longhi persuaded the singer to join the [[United States Merchant Marine|U.S. Merchant Marine]] in June 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&amp;nbsp;277–80,&amp;nbsp;287–91.&lt;/ref&gt; He made several voyages aboard merchant ships SS ''William B. Travis'', SS ''William Floyd'', and SS ''Sea Porpoise'', while they traveled in [[convoy]]s during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. He served as a mess man and dishwasher, and frequently sang for the crew and troops to buoy their spirits on transatlantic voyages. His first ship, ''William B. Travis'', hit a mine in the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which killed one person aboard, but it sailed to [[Bizerte]], [[Tunisia]] under her own power.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cressman, ''The Official Chronology of the U.S. Navy in World War II'', Naval Institute Press (1999), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

His last ship, ''Sea Porpoise'', took troops from the United States to England and France for the [[D-Day]] invasion. Guthrie was aboard when the ship was torpedoed off [[Utah Beach]] by the [[German submarine U-390]] on July 5, 1944, injuring 12 of the crew. Guthrie was unhurt and the ship stayed afloat; it returned to England, where it was repaired at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/3285.html ''Sea Porpoise'' U-Boat Net]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1944 it returned to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald D. Cohen, ''Woody Guthrie: Writing America's Songs'', pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Guthrie was an active supporter of the [[National Maritime Union]], the main union for wartime American merchant sailors. Guthrie wrote songs about his experience in the Merchant Marine but was never satisfied with them. Longhi later wrote about Guthrie's marine experiences in his book ''Woody, Cisco and Me''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Longhi |first=Jim |authorlink= Jim Longhi |title= Woody, Cisco and Me |year=1997 |publisher=[[Random House]] |isbn=0-252-02276-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book offers a rare first-hand account of Guthrie during his [[Merchant Marine]] service. In 1945, the government decided that Guthrie's association with Communism made him ineligible for further service in the Merchant Marine; he was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&amp;nbsp;302–03.&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was on [[Wiktionary:furlough|furlough]] from the Army, Guthrie married [[Marjorie Guthrie|Marjorie]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;312.&lt;/ref&gt; After his discharge, they moved into a house on Mermaid Avenue in [[Coney Island]] and over time had four children: daughters Cathy and [[Nora Guthrie|Nora]]; and sons [[Arlo Guthrie|Arlo]] and Joady. Cathy died as a result of a fire at the age of four, and Guthrie suffered a serious depression from his grief.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;344–351.&lt;/ref&gt; Arlo and Joady followed in their father's footsteps as singer-songwriters.

When his family was young, Guthrie wrote and recorded ''[[Songs to Grow on for Mother and Child]]'', a collection of [[children's music]], which includes the song "Goodnight Little Arlo (Goodnight Little Darlin')", written when Arlo was about nine years old. During 1947 he wrote ''House of Earth'', an historical novel containing explicit sexual material, about a couple who build a house made of clay and earth to withstand the [[Dust Bowl]]'s brutal weather. He could not get it published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2013/02/05/170496691/woodie-guthries-house-of-earth-calls-this-land-home |title=Woody Guthrie's 'House of Earth' Calls 'This Land' Home |last1=Neary |first1=Lynn |date=February 5, 2013 |work=[[NPR]] |publisher=NPR |accessdate=February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published posthumously in 2013, by [[Harper (publisher)|Harper]], under actor [[Johnny Depp]]'s publishing imprint, [[Infinitum Nihil]].

The years immediately after the war when he lived on Mermaid Avenue were among Guthrie's most productive as a writer.

During this time [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]] studied extensively under Guthrie, visiting his home and observing how he wrote&lt;!--wrote music or words?--&gt; and performed. Elliott, like [[Bob Dylan]] later, idolized Guthrie. He was inspired by the singer's idiomatic performance style and repertoire. Because of the decline caused by Guthrie's progressive [[Huntington's disease]], Arlo Guthrie and Bob Dylan both later said that they had learned much of Guthrie's performance style from Elliott. When asked about this, Elliott said, "I was flattered. Dylan learned from me the same way I learned from Woody. Woody didn't teach me. He just said, If you want to learn something, just steal it—that's the way I learned from [[Lead Belly]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3495000026.html|title=Elliott, Ramblin’ Jack|work=Encyclopedia.com (quote from a 1984 ''[[Esquire magazine]]'' interview with Randy Sue Coburn)|accessdate=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s and 1960s===

====Deteriorating health due to Huntington's ====
By the late 1940s, Guthrie's health was declining, and his behavior was becoming extremely erratic. He received various diagnoses (including [[alcoholism]] and [[schizophrenia]]). In 1952, it was finally determined that he was suffering from [[Huntington's disease]],&lt;ref name="Celebrity Diagnosis"/&gt; a genetic disorder inherited from his mother. Believing him to be a danger to their children because of his behavior, Marjorie suggested he return to California without her. They eventually divorced&lt;!--or, they divorced in[year]--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;388–94,&amp;nbsp;399.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to California, Guthrie lived at the [[Theatricum Botanicum]], a summer-stock type theatre founded and owned by [[Will Geer]]. Together singers and actors who had been blacklisted by [[HUAC]], he waited out the [[anti-communist]] political climate.

As his health worsened, he met and married his third wife, Anneke Van Kirk.  They had a child, Lorinna Lynn. The couple moved to [[Fruit Cove, Florida]], where they briefly lived. They lived in a bus on land called [[Beluthahatchee]], owned by his friend [[Stetson Kennedy]]. Guthrie's arm was hurt in an accident when gasoline used to start the campfire exploded. Although he regained movement in the arm, he was never able to play the guitar again. In 1954, the couple returned to New York.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;418–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Anneke filed for divorce, a result of the strain of caring for Guthrie. Van Kirk left New York after arranging for friends to adopt Lorinna Lynn. Lorinna had no further contact with her birth parents. She died in a car accident in California in 1973 at the age of 19. After the divorce, Guthrie's second wife, Marjorie, re-entered his life and cared for him until his death.

Increasingly unable to control his muscles, Guthrie was hospitalized at [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital]] in Morris County, New Jersey, from 1956 to 1961; at Brooklyn State Hospital (now Kingsboro Psychiatric Center) in [[East Flatbush, Brooklyn|East Flatbush]] until 1966;&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;433–39&lt;/ref&gt; and finally at [[Creedmoor Psychiatric Center]] in [[Queens Village, Queens|Queens Village]], New York, until his death in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;460.&lt;/ref&gt; Marjorie and the children visited Guthrie at Greystone every Sunday. They answered fan mail and the children played on the hospital grounds. Eventually a longtime fan of Guthrie invited the family to his nearby home for the Sunday visits. This lasted until Guthrie was moved to the Brooklyn State Hospital, which was closer to [[Howard Beach, Queens|Howard Beach]], New York, where Marjorie and the children then lived.

During the final few years of his life, Guthrie had become isolated except for family. The progression of Huntington's threw Guthrie into extreme emotional states, causing him to lash out at those nearby and to damage a prized book collection of Anneke's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=DNA is Not Destiny|last=Heine|first=Steven|publisher=W.W. Norton and Co.|year=2017|isbn=978-0-393-24408-3|location=New York, NY|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huntington's symptoms include uncharacteristic aggression, emotional volatility, and social disinhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington's Outreach Project for Education, at Stanford.

Guthrie's illness was essentially untreated, because of a lack of knowledge about the disease. Because of his professional renown, his death from this cause helped raise awareness of the disease. Marjorie helped found the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease, which became the [[Huntington's Disease Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arévalo J, Wojcieszek J, Conneally PM |title=Tracing Woody Guthrie and Huntington's disease |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=209–23 |date=June 2001 |pmid=11442329 |doi= 10.1055/s-2001-15269|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of Guthrie's three surviving children with Marjorie has developed symptoms of Huntington's.

====Folk revival and Guthrie's death====
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a new generation of young people was inspired by folk singers such as Guthrie. These "folk revivalists" became more politically aware in their music than those of the previous generation. The [[American folk music revival|American Folk Revival]] was beginning to take place, focused on the issues of the day, such as the [[civil rights movement]] and [[Free Speech Movement]]. Pockets of folk singers were forming around the country in places such as [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of New York City. One of Guthrie's visitors at Greystone Park was the 19-year-old [[Bob Dylan]],&lt;ref&gt;Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; who idolized Guthrie. Dylan wrote of Guthrie's repertoire: "The songs themselves were really beyond category. They had the infinite sweep of humanity in them."&lt;ref&gt;Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  After learning of Guthrie's whereabouts, Dylan regularly visited him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Let Us Now Praise Little Men | date=May 31, 1983|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896825,00.html | publisher=''Time Magazine'' |accessdate = 2007-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guthrie died of complications of [[Huntington's disease]] on October 3, 1967. By the time of his death, his work had been discovered by a new audience, introduced to them through Dylan, [[Pete Seeger]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], his ex-wife Marjorie and other new members of the folk revival, and his son [[Arlo Guthrie|Arlo]].

===Jewish songs===
Marjorie Mazia was born Marjorie Greenblatt and her mother, [[Aliza Greenblatt]], was a well-known Yiddish poet. With her, Guthrie wrote numerous Jewish lyrics. Guthrie's Jewish lyrics can be traced to the unusual collaborative relationship he had with his mother-in-law, who lived across from Guthrie and his family in Brooklyn in the 1940s. Guthrie (the Oklahoma troubadour) and Greenblatt (the Jewish wordsmith) often discussed their artistic projects and critiqued each other's works, finding common ground in their shared love of culture and social justice, despite very different backgrounds. Their collaboration flourished in 1940s Brooklyn, where Jewish culture was interwoven with music, modern dance, poetry and anti-fascist, pro-labor, classic socialist activism. Guthrie was inspired to write songs that came directly out of this unlikely relationship, both personal and political; he identified the problems of Jews with those of his fellow Okies and other oppressed peoples.

These lyrics were rediscovered by [[Nora Guthrie]] and were set to music by the Jewish Klezmer group [[The Klezmatics]] with the release of ''Happy Joyous Hanukkah'' on JMG Records in 2007. The Klezmatics also released ''Wonder Wheel&amp;nbsp;– Lyrics by Woody Guthrie'', an album of spiritual lyrics put to music composed by the band.&lt;ref&gt;WoodyGuthrie.org.

Since his death, artists have paid tribute to Guthrie by [[Cover versions|covering]] his songs or by dedicating songs to him. On January 20, 1968, three months after Guthrie's death, [[Harold Leventhal]] produced ''A Tribute to Woody Guthrie'' at New York City's [[Carnegie Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;WoodyGuthrie.org.

In 1986, Irvine also recorded both parts of Guthrie's "The Ballad of Tom Joad" together as a complete song—under the title of "Tom Joad"—on the first album released by his other band, [[Patrick Street]]. [[Bruce Springsteen]] also performed a cover of Guthrie's "This Land is Your Land" on his live album ''[[Live 1975–1985]]''. In the introduction to the song, Springsteen referred to it as "just about one of the most beautiful songs ever written."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081001231225/http://www.fretbase.com/fretbase/2008/07/play-woody-guth.html Fretbase, Play Woody Guthrie's This Land is Your Land]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 Sammy Walker's LP ''Songs From Woody's Pen'' was released by Folkways Records.

In "''[[I'm Not There]]''", a 2007 biographical movie about [[Bob Dylan]], one of the characters introduced in the film as segments of Dylan's life is a young African-American boy who calls himself "Woody Guthrie". The purpose of this particular character was a reference to Dylan's youthful obsession with Guthrie. The fictional Woody also reflects the fictitious autobiographies that Dylan constructed during his early career as he established his own artistic identity. In the film there is even a scene where the fictional Woody visits the real Woody Guthrie as he lies ill and dying in a hospital in New York (a reference to the times when a nineteen-year-old Dylan would regularly visit his idol, after learning of his whereabouts, while he was hospitalized in New York in the 1960s). Later, a sketch on "Saturday Night Live" would spoof these visits, alleging that Dylan stole the line, "They'll stone you for playing your guitar!" from Guthrie.
