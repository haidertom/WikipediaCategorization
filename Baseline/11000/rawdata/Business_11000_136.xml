      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4753">The '''Arison family''' is an [[Israeli-American]] business family.  Moshe and Sarah Arisohn immigrated to [[Ottoman Empire | Ottoman]] Palestine from [[Romania]] in 1882, and were among the founders of the town of [[Zikhron Ya'akov]].&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite news|author= Neri Livneh|title=The Arison family: From riches to riches|url=http://www.haaretz.com/from-riches-to-riches-1.20763|work=[[Haaretz|Haaretz Daily Newspaper]]|date=2003-01-29|accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their eldest son was Meir Arisohn, who was the father of Theodore Arisohn (later Ted Arison) and two daughters, Aviva and Rina. 
The family of Ted Arison are his first wife [[Mina Arison]] (who became Mina Sapir after marrying her second husband, Yekutiel Sapir), their two children [[Micky Arison]] and [[Shari Arison]], Ted's second wife [[Lin Arison|Marilyn B. Arison]], and her son [[Michael Arison]] who Ted later adopted, and their spouses.

==Notable members==
* [[Ted Arison]] (1924-1999), Israeli businessman, was born as Theodore Arisohn in [[Tel Aviv]] in 1924, during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]].  He served in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] and participated in [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|Israeli War of Independence]]. After his army service he moved to the [[United States]] and became a business man. He founded [[Carnival Cruise Lines]] which earned him a fortune as it grew to be one of the biggest in the world. Over time he became one of the richest people in the world. As he got on in years, he returned to Israel. He contributed large sums of money to the state of Israel to build hospitals and to establish charity organizations. In 1997 he acquired from the state of Israel (as part of a government privatization plan) most of the controlling shares in [[Bank Hapoalim]], the biggest bank in Israel.

A history of Arison's involvement in the cruise industry and the Carnival Cruise company can be found in Kristoffer Garin's book ''Devils on the Deep Blue Sea'' (Plume; 1 edition (Jun 27 2006). The global cruising industry is dominated by two companies, Carnival and [[Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd.|Royal Caribbean]]. The latter also happens to be associated with an Israeli family – the [[Ofer Brothers Group|Ofer brothers]], who own a significant stake in Royal Caribbean.
[[File:Shari Arison1.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Shari Arison]]]]

* [[Micky Arison]], born in 1949, is Ted and Mina Arison's son. He was the Chief Executive Officer of Carnival Corporation plc until August 2013, and continues to be the Chairman of the Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2013-07-14/business/fl-carnival-corp-ceo-donald-profile-20130714_1_carnival-cruise-ceo-talks-princess-cruises&lt;/ref&gt; He has developed Carnival into a global cruise company and one of the largest vacation companies in the world. The portfolio of leading cruise brands includes Carnival Cruise Lines, Holland America Line, Princess Cruises and Seabourn Cruise Line in North America; P&amp;O Cruises, Cunard Line and Ocean Village in the United Kingdom; AIDA in Germany; Costa Cruises in southern Europe; Iberocruceros in Spain; and P&amp;O Cruises in Australia. He is also the owner of the [[NBA]]'s [[Miami Heat]]. He has two adult children.

* [[Shari Arison]], born in 1957 in [[New York City]], is Ted and Mina Arison's daughter. She immigrated to Israel with her father and after his death inherited part (35%) of his fortune. Her primary inheritance was her father's investments in Israel, among them, the shares of [[Bank Hapoalim]]. She left Israel for a brief period following her father's death, and moved to [[Miami]].  News reporter [[Shelly Yachimovich]] said Shari was motivated by greed in her move out of Israel. Shari Arison accused Yachimovich of slandering her. In 2004 she and her then husband [[Ofer Glazer]] returned to Israel. As of 2011, she is Israel's richest woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/wealth/billionaires/list?country=211&amp;industry=-1&amp;state= Forbes list 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Lasarow was born in [[Johannesburg, South Africa]] but educated in the USA where he gained his grade 12 general equivalency diploma at 16. After briefly returning to South Africa, Lasarow then moved to the United Kingdom where he began his career which ultimately led to a string of multinational companies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2017/may/25/dna-testing-we-created-the-market-for-what-we-do-living-dna-dnafit-geneu|title=The lucrative rise of DNA testing: 'we created the market for what we do'|last=Williams|first=Mark|date=2017-05-25|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
From 1996 until 2001 Lasarow worked at Citigroup in the UK as a support manager, designing and implementing a helpdesk in India and implementing technology solutions globally. In 2002 he worked at Citigroup in the capacity of a technology project manager, integrating software on a global basis.

=== DNA Bioscience===
At 26, Lasarow founded and was Managing Director of DNA Bioscience, a UK-based DNA testing company specialising in paternity testing. DNA Bioscience recruited former Labour MP [[David Blunkett]], as a non-executive director, who allegedly bought £15 000 of shares two weeks before Britain's 2005 general election. After the election, Blunkett rejoined the government as Work and Pensions Secretary. Upon his return to parliament he was asked why he had not consulted the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments on his relationship with the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/blunkett-and-dna-bioscience-the-dna-of-a-troubled-relationship-8699400.html|title=Blunkett and DNA Bioscience: The DNA of a troubled relationship|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy led to his resignation and as a result,  DNA Bioscience failed to secure final listing support and went into liquidation.

It was in this same year that Lasarow authored and published a book entitled, "Who is Really Who?" – the UK’s first guide to DNA paternity testing.

===Trimega===
The collapse of DNA Bioscience led to Lasarow founding, being Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director of Trimega Laboratories in 2005, a leading, forensic science company for testing hair for evidence of alcohol and drug abuse. The firm turned approximately £140 000 in its first year, and approximately £6 million in 2011 which was six years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/week-avi-lasarow-trimega-laboratories/article/1107499/ |title=My Week: Avi Lasarow of Trimega Laboratories |date=2 December 2011 |website=[[Management Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company which operated out of a 1900 square foot laboratory in Manchester also provided services for doctors wishing to test a patient's suitability for organ transplants,assisting governments and emergency services with identifying victims of disasters. The company also developed the DrugAlyser, a roadside drug testing device used by police in South Africa and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itv.com/news/2016-02-28/arrests-for-drug-driving-soar-800-since-new-laws-were-introduced/|title=Arrests for drug-driving soar 800% since new laws were introduced|work=ITV News|access-date=2018-08-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Trimega's initial success the company ran into difficulty in 2014 following a downturn in the paternity testing market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/business/trimega-labs-goes-bust-jobs-7009796|title=Jobs axe as DNA testing firm folds|last=Brooks-Pollock|first=Tom|date=2014-04-19|work=men|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mole Detect===
In 2012, Lasarow incorporated L-Health a company setup to acquire existing technology from MIT and New Consumer Solutions LLC. The technology was designed for educational purposes only and worked by scanning pictures of an individuals mole and generating a report on them using well known ABCDE criteria. Within one week post the acquisition of the technology and having all the warranties in place, the product was featured on the Dr. Oz show generating an excess of $50,000 in downloads. As a result, the product became subject to litigation with the Federal Trade Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/mole-tester-app-deceptively-claiming-to-analyse-cancer-risk-without-evidence-says-watchdog-10154846.html|title=The mole testing app that isn't quite what it seems|date=3 April 2015|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only in 2015 that Lasarow settled on the basis that the cost of litigation cross-border was cost prohibitive .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2015/02/23/ftc-fines-marketers-of-two-apps-that-claim-to-detect-melanoma/|title=FTC fines marketers of two apps that claim to detect melanoma|first=Hayley|last=Tsukayama|date=23 February 2015|website=Washingtonpost.com|accessdate=24 December 2017|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final settlement was completed in 2015 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2971132/government/seller-of-melanoma-detection-apps-settles-ftc-complaint.html|title=Seller of melanoma detection apps settles FTC complaint|website=Pcworld.com|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNAFit===
In 2013 Lasarow created the company DNAFit, a technology company that maps user DNA to give them nutrition and fitness insights.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The technology works by gathering data from a selection of genetic variants which are linked to a body’s response to exercise and nutrition. These variants are selected by the company’s scientific advisory board as the genetic mutations with the strongest evidence base for use in fitness or nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dnafit.com/science/|title=DNAFit - Genetic Information for Fitness &amp; Nutrition (US)|website=Dnafit.com|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The product provides reports to its users and generates training and nutrition plans based on those reports.

'''Ayo Ogunsheye''' is a [[Nigerian]] academic, [[nationalism]] scholar and former head of the extra murals department of [[University of Ibadan]]. In 1970, he was one of the major high-profile executive personnel brought into indigenous private enterprise which were historically family dominated at the executive level.&lt;ref&gt;Tom G. Forrest, The Advance of African Capital: The Growth of Nigerian Private Enterprise . p 95. University of Virginia Press.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Henry Fajemirokun]] in 1979, he became the Chief Executive officer of Henry Stephens Nigeria Limited.

==Extra murals department==
The extra [[murals]] [[Academic department|department]] of the [[university]] of Ibadan was established in 1949 to focus on [[adult education]] in the nation. A reason given for its creation was to expand [[knowledge]] to non-Ibadan graduates so as not to create a dominant network of [[college graduate|graduate]] [[elites]]. However, the prospect of [[independence]] led to increased enthusiasm for knowledge in various towns and cities. The department soon devoted resources and research into the issue of self-government. A number of nationalistic politicians attended courses or seminars offered by the department in the 1950s. Ayo Ogunsheye, as director was a vital element in the department which included noted scholar [[Ulli Beier]].

===Self government seminar===
As an academic, Ayo Ogunsheye wrote often on the need to tilt education towards improving [[nation]]al [[consciousness]] and bringing the informal education sector into public consciousness. In 1959, when the clamor for independence was at it loudest, a conference was held at [[Ibadan]] to hash out impending independent issues. As chairman of the first of such [[seminar]] in the region, the international conference discussed 'representative government and Progress in West Africa'.&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;K. A. B. Jones-Quartey, H. Passin; Africa: The Dynamic of Change. University Press, 1963. p 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his views about self-government emphasized the need to ensure internal [[Social cohesion|cohesion]] in order to improve the [[standard of living]] of citizens. Using the [[adage]], a nation divided against itself cannot stand, he stressed the extradition of internal chaos by the use of an appropriate  [[constitution]], which would become a necessary factor for strengthening the country,&lt;ref&gt;Jones p 89-90&lt;/ref&gt; However, like his views on education, a lot them dealt with nationalism and how to ensure dynamic progress for black Africa. He also emphasized major complementary cases for unity in [[West Africa]] and Nigeria. That Nigeria as a large and diverse nation will provide instances where regions can benefit from fair exchange of food and resources. The need to attract foreign [[Financial capital|capital]] will become closer to reality with the existence of a large [[country]] suitable for foreign investors.  Most of his views shed light on the need to maximize the potential of a large [[nation]] in order to benefit from increased external visibility and internal [[financial]] base for extended social services.&lt;ref&gt;Jones  p 91&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Azienda Nazionale Idrogenazione Combustibili''' ('''ANIC''') S.p.A was the name of an [[italy|Italian]] company, which was to pursue the derivation of fuel by [[hydrogenation]] of [[brown coal]]. It was created in 1936 by [[AGIP]] and [[Montecatini (company)|Montecatini]] as a [[joint stock company|joint company]]. It operates also three oil refineries. In 1953, it became a subsidiary of [[Eni]].

In 1982 it was reformed as '''EniChimica''' and in 1984 it was merged into '''EniChem'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4592">The term '''business operating system''' ('''BOS''') refers to standard, enterprise-wide collection of [[business process]]es used in many diversified industrial companies. The definition has also been extended to include the common structure, principles and practices necessary to drive the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Hope Is Not a Strategy | author = Ted Gee | page = 85 | publisher = Dog Ear | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-59858-767-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diversified industrial companies like [[Ingersoll Rand]], [[Honeywell]], and [[Danaher Corporation|Danaher]] have adopted a standard, common collection of business processes and/or [[business process management|business process improvement methodologies]] which they use to manage strategy development and execution. In the case of [[Danaher]], the business system is a core part of the company's culture, is seen as one of the key drivers of corporate performance, and is therefore a differentiator for shareholders and prospective employees.

The objectives of such systems are to ensure daily work is focused on the organisation's strategic objectives and is done in the most efficient way. The systems deal with the questions "why" (purpose of the work), "what" (specific objectives of the work) and "how" (the processes used to do the work). The Toyota Production System is focused on both how to make cars, and how to improve the way cars are made. A third objective can also be added, which is to improve the business system itself by identifying or improving the component tools and techniques.

== Terminology. ==
Terms used to describe such systems include:
* XPS - meaning “Company-specific Production System" with the X standing in place of the company name
* Business System
* Management Operating System

== Examples of business operating systems ==
* [[Toyota]]'s [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS) is one of the earliest examples, developed between 1948 and 1975
* [[Danaher]] is well known for its Danaher Business System (DBS)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.danaher.com/how-we-work/danaher-business-system&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fortive]] (a company that split from Danaher in 2016) has the Fortive Business System (FBS) which is derived from the DBS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fortive.com/fortive-business-system&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ingersoll Rand]] established the Ingersoll Rand business operating system (BOS) to describe the six enterprise focus areas and its process improvement method ([[Lean Six Sigma]]).
* [[Honeywell]] has the Honeywell Operating System (HOS)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.honeywell.com/who-we-are/our-initiatives/hos-gold&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Idex Corporation]] has the Idex Operating Model &lt;ref&gt;http://www.idexcorp.com/about/about_strategy.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.etw.com/ ETW (Execute to Win)]
* Bosch Production System
* Boeing Production System
* Audi Production System
* Lego Production System
* John Deere Quality and Production System
* Alcoa Business System
* REC Production System
* Electrolux Manufacturing System
* Novo Nordisk - "cLEAN” 
* Trumpf - “Synchro”
* Magellan Operating System ([[Magellan Aerospace]])

== List of common features ==
Many of business operating systems share common features. This is because the systems are derived from other known systems, and from established methods and practices for business management. The following is a list of features that appear in several systems.
* Hoshin Kanri, a strategic planning methodology developed by [[Yoji Akao]], used to create goals, assign them measurable milestones, and assess progress against those milestones (Hoshin Kanri is also referred to as Policy Deployment or X-Matrix)
* Standard work - the best and most reliable methods and sequences for each work process which is used as the basis for sustaining improvements
* Process improvement methodologies: [[Lean Six Sigma|Lean]], [[Six Sigma]], and [[Kaizen]] are popular approaches incorporated in business systems 
* [[Just-in-time manufacturing|Just-in-time]] manufacturing
* [[Gemba]] walks
* Jidoka - "automation with a human touch" where human intervention is used to improve machine performance
* Visual controls or visual management where management processes (e.g. checking) use simple graphics to show problems at a glance
* Problem solving techniques such as [[root cause analysis]]
* Technology: While these standard business operating systems may inform or be linked to a company's technology platform, they more commonly refer to the way the company manages complex business processes in a common way across its diverse portfolio of businesses.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4217">The '''''Canadian Football Act''''' (1974), also known in its long title as '''''An Act respecting Canadian Professional Football''''', was a proposed [[Act of Parliament|Act]] by the [[Parliament of Canada]] in April 1974 designed to give a government-protected [[monopoly]] over [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional]] [[Canadian football|football]] in Canada to the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). Although it was never signed into law, the move by the government eventually compelled the [[World Football League]]'s [[Toronto Northmen]] to move to the [[United States]] as the [[Memphis Southmen]]. The spectre of the Act was again raised when [[John F. Bassett]], the owner of the Northmen/Southmen franchise, proposed a [[United States Football League]] franchise for [[Hamilton, Ontario]], in 1983.

In 2007, there was speculation that a similar act would develop if the [[National Football League]] attempted to [[National Football League in Toronto|expand to Toronto]] and thus threaten the Canadian league's existence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/64892 NFL's New Hot Market Is North of the Border - October 19, 2007 - The New York Sun&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Such an act would likely still allow for an NFL team to play in Canada in an NFL preseason game and the CFL's off season; thus allowing for a Canadian city to host the Super Bowl if the NFL decided to host their premier event in a stadium far from an NFL city.{{citation needed|date = December 2018}}

It is also unlikely that any future act will be passed to affect American college football, such as the [[NCAA]] and [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]], who have or have had teams based in Canada  ([[Simon Fraser University]] being the lone NCAA member in Canada) and bowl games hosted in Canadian cities, with no opposition, in part because the CFL draws some of its players from American college teams (and, in the case of bowl games, because their December and January scheduling is well after [[U Sports football|Canadian university football]] ends its season).

==Details==
* Designated C-22.
* Introduced by the [[Minister of Health (Canada)|Minister of Health]], [[Marc Lalonde]].
* Claimed it would protect the Canadian Football League, would allow the CFL to grow and develop its own distinct character
* Of the mayors of the nine CFL cities at the time, only three were against the ''Canadian Football Act''. They were the mayors of [[List of mayors of Vancouver|Vancouver]], [[List of mayors of Montreal|Montreal]] and [[List of Toronto mayors|Toronto]], also the biggest cities of Canada then and now, with two of them hosting teams from leagues that played a different code of football. Montreal played host to one of the [[World League of American Football]] teams, the [[Montréal Machine]], in the early 1990s after their CFL team folded in the late 1980s. Toronto were hosts to an [[Arena Football League]] team for two seasons, the [[Toronto Phantoms]].
* After the bill passed second reading in the [[House of Commons of Canada]], it was given to the Standing Committee on Health, Welfare and Social Affairs, where it effectively died after the Northmen moved to Memphis.
* Clause 6 in the ''Act'' stated that no person that owns, operates, or manages a team in a league foreign from the CFL shall play in Canada. Subsection 2 stated that no player or member of the said team shall play in Canada, therefore if the bill passed and became law, it would effectively kill teams like the Northmen.

These facts were gathered from the actual debates held in the House of Commons from April 10 to April 28, 1974.

The '''Carriage of Goods by Sea Act''' ("COGSA")&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode46a/usc_sup_05_46_10_28.html&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Law of the United States|United States]] [[statute]] governing the rights and responsibilities between [[wikt:shipper|shipper]]s of [[cargo]] and [[ship-owner]]s regarding ocean shipments to and from the United States.  It is the U.S. enactment of the International Convention Regarding Bills of Lading, commonly known as the "[[Hague Rules]]". It was found in [[Title 46 of the Code of Federal Regulations|Title 46]] Appendix of the [[United States Code]], starting at Section 1301, but has been moved to a note in 46 [[United States Code]] 30701.&lt;ref&gt;Pub.L. 109-304, § 6(c), Oct. 6, 2006, 120 Stat. 1516&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Congress]], concerned that the Hague Rules did not offer shippers enough protection against damage to cargo by shipowners,  amended the Hague Rules in a number of minor, but important, ways. It increased the amount that shipowners would have to pay cargo owners for damage in transit from [[Pound sterling|GBP]] 100 per package to US$500 per package or, for goods not shipped in packages, per customary freight unit. This "package limitation" has become one of the most contentious and litigious areas in the field of cargo damage,  particularly as it relates to the transportation of goods by ocean [[Intermodal container|shipping containers]].

== History of Limitation of Liability for Cargo Damage ==
At the time of the passage of COGSA most cargo was shipped in boxes, crates, and bags. Shortly after its passage, cargo owners determined that cargo could be handled more efficiently if placed on [[pallet]]s, a process that results in numerous boxes or bags of cargo being consolidated on a single pallet. Shipowners, seeing an opportunity to reduce their liability for cargo damage, argued to the courts that the pallets were now "packages" and that they were entitled to limit their liability to $500 per pallet. Some courts agreed.

[[Image:teu.jpg|left|thumb|A {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} long [[intermodal container|ISO container]], or TEU.]]

Later, shipowners began offering cargo owners the opportunity to ship their cargoes in large ocean [[Containerization|shipping container]]s.  The containers came in two sizes &amp;mdash; {{convert|8|ft|m}} high x {{convert|8|ft|m}} wide x {{convert|20|ft|m}} long (2.4&amp;nbsp;m x 2.4&amp;nbsp;m x 6&amp;nbsp;m) or 8 x 8 x {{convert|40|ft|m}} long. The term "[[Twenty-foot equivalent unit]]" or TEU derived from this size - a TEU was a space aboard a ship that was {{convert|8|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|8|ft|m}} high by {{convert|20|ft|m}} long.

Shipowners, again seeing an opportunity to limit their liability,  began arguing that the containers were "packages" and that they could limit their liability to $500 per container,  even though the contents of a container may be valued at over $500,000. Again, some courts agreed.

It is this imbalance, both in the relative bargaining power of cargo owners, and the superior bargaining power of shipowners, and the imbalance between $500 per container and the true value of a shipment which has led to countless [[lawsuit]]s and judicial opinions over the "package limitation" problem.

The rest of the world, seeing this as an attempt by shipowners to free themselves from responsibility for protecting cargo, amended the Hague Rules in 1968 with the [[Visby Amendments]] which eliminated the "per package" limitation and substituted a limitation per kilogram. In so doing, litigation concerning limitations on liability became virtually non-existent outside the United States. However, Congress failed to pass the Visby Amendments to the Hague Rules.

== Limitation of Liability for Cargo not shipped in Packages ==
Many types of cargo are not shipped in packages such as automobiles, yachts, cranes, and heavy construction equipment.  For those cargoes, Congress had intended{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} the limitation on liability for shipowners to be $500 per 100 cubic feet (3.7&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

At the time of the passage of COGSA the customary freight unit for most cargo was the "revenue ton" - the number of long tons (2240&amp;nbsp;lb, 1017&amp;nbsp;kg) or measurement tons (100 cubic feet) that would produce the most revenue for the shipowner.  For example, a cargo of [[aluminium]] [[ingot]]s, which were not packaged for shipment,  would be heavy and dense, so the customary freight unit for aluminum ingots would be the [[long ton]],  a measurement of weight.  By comparison, a shipment of [[canoe]]s, which were not packaged for shipment, would be light but would take up a large volume, ensuring the customary freight unit would be the measurement ton of {{convert|100|cuft|m3}}.  If a canoe were {{convert|2|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|2|ft|m}} high by {{convert|10|ft|m}} long (0.6&amp;nbsp;m x 0.6&amp;nbsp;m x 3&amp;nbsp;m), its measurement would be 40 cubic feet (2 x 2 x 10) which would be one measurement ton (anything less than 100 would be 1 by default) and hence the limitation would be $500 per canoe.

The courts, possibly believing that Congress' approach was too cumbersome, jettisoned the word "customary" from the phrase "customary freight unit" and decided that whatever freight unit the shipowner applied would be the freight unit for determining the limitation on liability.  Again, seeing an opportunity to limit their liability for cargo damage,  shipowners began freighting all cargo by unit, rather than by units of weight or measurement. Consequently, an automobile which might have a volume of 400 cubic feet (15&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), or 4 measurement tons, which would previously entitle the carrier to a limitation of $2000, was now freighted as "one automobile" thereby reducing the shipowner's liability from $2000 per automobile to $500.

'''Dale Allison Graham''' (born October 6, 1951&lt;ref name="parlg"&gt;''Canadian Parliamentary Guide, 1997'', Kathryn O'Handley {{ISBN|1-896413-43-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a former [[politician]] in [[New Brunswick]], Canada.  He served as an [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick|MLA]] from 1993 to 2014, as Speaker of the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick]] from 2010 to 2014, and as a member of the [[Executive Council of New Brunswick|provincial cabinet]] from 1999 to 2006.

Born in [[Woodstock, New Brunswick|Woodstock]], [[New Brunswick]], the son of Robert Graham and Letha Delong,&lt;ref name="parlg"/&gt; Graham attended school in [[Centreville, New Brunswick|Centreville]]. He became a small business owner and was involved in local politics at the [[school board]] level. He married Shelley McDougall in 1972.&lt;ref name="parlg"/&gt; In the [[New Brunswick general election, 1991|1991 provincial election]], Graham was defeated by [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberal]] incumbent [[Fred Harvey (politician)|Fred Harvey]], however Harvey's victory was later declared void when Harvey was convicted of violating election spending laws.  Graham was successful in a [[by-election]] in 1993 winning the [[Carleton North]] seat.  Graham went on to be re-elected in the new [[electoral district]] of [[Carleton (1995-2014 New Brunswick provincial electoral district)|Carleton]] in the [[New Brunswick general election, 1995|1995]], [[New Brunswick general election, 1999|1999]], [[New Brunswick general election, 2003|2003]], [[New Brunswick general election, 2006|2006]] and [[New Brunswick general election, 2010|2010]] [[List of New Brunswick general elections (post-Confederation)|elections]].

Graham's 1993 victory was a key test for his [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick]].  His party had been defeated provincially in [[New Brunswick general election, 1987|1987]] going from having led the government for 17 years to being shut out of the legislature.  Though the party regained 3 seats in the 58 seat legislature in 1991, the upstart [[Confederation of Regions Party of New Brunswick]] (CoR) had won 8 seats and claimed [[official opposition]].  Graham's victory was seen as a sign that CoR would not necessarily displace the Progressive Conservatives as the voice of [[conservatism]] in [[English Canadian|Anglophone]] New Brunswick.

In 1999, Graham's party was returned to government. Graham, who co-chaired the election campaign, was named [[deputy premier]] and [[Department of Supply and Services (New Brunswick)|Minister of Supply and Services]]. On July 21, 2005, Graham added the responsibilities of [[Department of Environment and Local Government (New Brunswick)|Minister of Environment &amp; Local Government]] on an acting basis when his cabinet colleague [[Brenda Fowlie]] was forced to resign from the cabinet.  He retained the portfolio until November 21, 2005.

In a [[cabinet shuffle]] on February 14, 2006, Graham was shuffled to the post of minister responsible for the [[Office of Human Resources (New Brunswick)|Office of Human Resources]] and for [[Service New Brunswick]]. He retained his honorary post of deputy premier.

His party failed to win a plurality of seats in the 2006 election so Graham left cabinet and returned to opposition.  He was re-elected in 2010 and his party returned to government, and he became [[Father of the House|dean of the legislature]]; he was excluded from cabinet but was elected to serve as speaker of the legislature.  He did not seek re-election in 2014.

{{Evidence law}}
An '''employment consultant''' is an [[expert witness]] who advises courts and tribunals on employment related issues such as earnings, labour market analysis, residual earning capacity, and retraining. The main area involved is that of personal injury litigation where loss of earnings is an important component of a claim. Employment consultants give evidence on pre and post accident earnings, thus establishing a loss of earnings formula.  Employment consultants also deal with sex, race and [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995|disability discrimination]], matrimonial matters and any case involving a loss or dispute of earnings. Increasingly, pay parity is a growth area.

Usually [[solicitor]]s will use an employment report to quantify the loss of earnings or ''Smith v. Manchester'' awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.piba.org.uk/assets/docs2/S_M-piba.doc |title=Smith v. Manchester Awards |format=[[Microsoft Word]] [[DOC (computing)|DOC]] |accessdate=2008-08-08 |first=Andrew |last=Ritchie |date=April 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012142608/http://www.piba.org.uk/assets/docs2/S_M-piba.doc |archivedate=October 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An employment consultant, like other experts witnesses, may be instructed by the solicitors for the claimant, the defendant, or as a jointly instructed expert, and may be required to give evidence under oath at trials and tribunal hearings.

Although employment consultants provide reports for many jurisdictions worldwide, the core areas are the countries using the [[common law]] system. Because of its different trial and compensation system for personal injury, the [[United States]] is less important than might be expected, and the main jurisdictions for which these experts prepare reports are [[English law|England and Wales]], [[Scots law|Scotland]], [[Republic of Ireland]] and [[South Africa]]. Most employment experts are based in the UK.

This type of expertise was a growth area from the mid-1980s to the end of the 1990s, but was adversely affected by changes in the [[United Kingdom]], the most important area. These included the withdrawal of [[legal aid]] for most personal injury cases, which meant that lawyers operating on a "[[no win no fee]]" basis were less likely to take up claims or incur the additional costs. 

The [[Civil Procedure Rules 1998]] also meant that the need for an [[expert report]] had to be sanctioned by a [[Judiciary of England and Wales#District judges|District Judge]], which, together with the introduction of joint instruction also reduced demand.

In the decade since the CPR a number of practitioners have diversified into associated areas such as case management, rehabilitation, and, increasingly, pay parity cases, following the wave of such cases initiated in the mid-2000s by [[trade union]]s and the controversial solicitor, Stefan Cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Cohen |title=A lawyer's help to underpaid women is putting the wind up trade unions |url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/careers/story/0,,1800949,00.html |work=[[The Observer]]  |date=2006-06-18 |accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Fricker |title=Greedy lawyers are making a fortune out of inequality |url=http://www.personneltoday.com/Articles/2007/01/16/38887/greedy-lawyers-are-making-a-fortune-out-of-inequality.html |work=Personnel Today |date=2007-01-16 |accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent (2007) case of importance to employment consultants and personal injury [[solicitor]]s is [[Van Wees v Karkour and Walsh]]. This dealt with the medical aspects of post-traumatic amnesia, but also clarified the financial impact of mild head injury even on those who remain capable of high level work. The judge in the case also made an important ruling that awards to women should '''not''' be based on their current lower earnings compared to men in the same occupation, since that would perpetuate inequality in the face of [[Equal Pay Act 1970|equal pay legislation]].

'''Sir Ernest Thomas Fisk''' (8 August 1886{{spaced ndash}}8 July 1965) was an [[English Australian]] businessman and entrepreneur who was the founder (1913) and later Managing Director (1916) and Chairman (1932) of [[Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia)]] (AWA). In 1944 was appointed Managing Director of the [[EMI]] music empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goot|first=Murray|title=Fisk, Sir Ernest Thomas (1886–1965)|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/fisk-sir-ernest-thomas-6177/text10617|publisher=Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September 1918 he proved the possibility of direct radio broadcasts from the UK to Australia by receiving the first such message at his Sydney home, 'Lucania'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ernest Fisk and the first wireless messages from the UK to Australia |url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/natural_world/.../people_places/north/professionals/fisk/index.html |publisher=[[State Library of New South Wales]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200034/http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/discover_collections/natural_world/.../people_places/north/professionals/fisk/index.html |archivedate=2014-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial was erected on 14 December 1935 to celebrate the achievement.

Fiskville, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], about 10 kilometres south of [[Ballan, Victoria|Ballan]], is named after him.

'''EuroShop''' is a [[trade fair]] for capital goods for the retail industry which has taken place since 1966. Held every three years on the grounds of [[Messe Düsseldorf]], it is looked to as the world’s leading trade fair for the [[retail]] sector.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The initiator of the fair is the EHI Retail Institute.

EuroShop 2017, running from 5 to 9 March, will be held in a new form. Whereas from 2002 to 2014 the fair’s overall offerings were divided into the four areas of EuroSales, EuroConcept, EuroCIS, and EuroExpo, EuroShop’s new format presents seven different dimensions of retail trade.

== Areas ==
* [[Point of presence]] (POP) or [[point of sale]] (POS) Marketing ([[signage]], displays, outdoor communication)
* Expo &amp; Event Marketing (stand construction and equipment, brand communication, communication design, event technology)

== International activities ==
In 2015, EuroShop established its first international offshoot with C-star – Shanghai’s International Trade Fair for Solutions and Trends all about Retail. The aim of its founding was to give interested EuroShop exhibitors a forum in which to present their products and services in the Asian region. In May 2016, 180 companies from 18 countries exhibited at C-star. The fair welcomed 7,600 trade visitors from 77 nations. C-star is held annually.

== History ==
EuroShop debuted from 11 to 15 June 1966 on the old [[exhibition]] grounds in the Ehrenhof. A total of 331 exhibitors from 55 countries took advantage of the new platform to present their products. The some 29,000 trade visitors who attended primarily sought information on shop fitting, the dominant subject of the initial events. The fair was held in conjunction with a congress for ‘modern shops and display windows’. EuroShop was founded in response to fundamental changes in retail trade. From the mid-1960s, self-service concepts became increasingly prevalent, especially in the food retail industry. Simultaneously, the first discount supermarkets, introducing new retail concepts, emerged as competitors to the traditionally brand-oriented supermarkets. To heighten their own profile, merchants were increasingly compelled to turn to new measures, especially in the area of shop fitting.

Until 1972, EuroShop took place every two years. Because innovation in the area of shop fitting occurred in medium-term cycles, the fair was held at three-year intervals beginning in 1975. The EuroShop portfolio simultaneously underwent a transformation. Through the 1990s, further offerings emerged that were of growing importance for retail companies. These included, among other things, promotional design, lighting design, and exhibition stand construction. Rapid developments in the information technology sector brought new offerings in such areas as IT, [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) and control systems, merchandise security and [[supply chain management]], the lifecycles of which were significantly shorter than those of the fair’s traditional offerings. EuroShop responded by creating the annual Retail Technology Forum, which in every third year was held as part of EuroShop. In 2002, EuroShop was fundamentally restructured in order to preserve the clarity of the ever-expanding exhibition offerings for fair visitors. The fair was divided into four overall areas:

* EuroConcept (shop fitting, store design, lighting, refrigeration equipment, building technology)
* EuroSales (visual merchandising, POS marketing, promotional design)
* EuroExpo (architecture, design, events)
* EuroCIS (IT and security technology)

The newly created EuroCIS replaced the Retail Technology Forum. With its overhauled structure, EuroShop has grown steadily. In 2014, 2,229 companies and organisations presented their products and services in 120,603 m² of exhibition space, with 109,496 visitors from 100 countries underscoring the fair’s international importance.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Logo ==
EuroShop began as a fair for shop fitting and window displays. This can be seen in its first logo, which took the form of a stylised shop and display window. In the mid-1970s, the old logo was replaced by the bi-coloured EuroShop star, which remains the fair’s trademark.{{cn|date=October 2018}} The logo is derived from the sigma sign of the cash till, its two colours symbolising the conjuncture of supply and demand that underlies all areas of capital goods in the retail sector.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Career ==

Akhundov started his career in 1986 as the Chief Engineer in the Engineering and Construction Department of the [[Ministry of Defense of the USSR]]. During 1987-1991 he was appointed as a head of the regulatory research station in the system of Special Construction of the Ministry of Defense of the USSR. In 1991 he joined the State Committee for Economy and Planning of the [[Republic of Azerbaijan]] at the position of Chief Economist and Deputy Director of the Directorate of Business Regulation and Economic and Legal Expertise.

Akhundov was engaged in the development of draft laws in the field of economy that laid the foundations of the market reforms in the Republic of Azerbaijan. He took part in the drafting of the following laws: "On the Securities Market", "On the Liberalization of Business", "On the Stock Exchange". In 1992 he was appointed as the advisor of the Presidential Administration of the Republic of Azerbaijan. He continued to participate in the development of the economic legislation of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

Akhundov took part in the development of [[antitrust]] legislation and of laws including "On the Property" and "On the Committee for State Property", which ensured the country's transition from a centrally [[planned economy]] to a [[market economy]]. After the post-graduate studies at the University of Texas (Austin, Texas, United States), he began his career in the banking system of the Republic of Azerbaijan. In 1993 he headed the International Banking Operations Department at the Industrial Investment Bank of Azerbaijan. In 1994 he took the position of Director of the Department for Regulation of Foreign Exchange Transactions and International Financial Institutions in the National Bank of Azerbaijan (NBA). Later, Akhundov was appointed Director of the Department for Monetary Policy and Regulation of Foreign Exchange Operations in the NBA.

From August 1994 to September 1995, Akhundov was the Deputy Chairman of the National Bank of Azerbaijan. While working at the National Bank of Azerbaijan, he led the bank's team at the negotiations of the NBA with the IMF and the [[World Bank]]. Being one of the founders of the first monetary program of the NBA, he personally developed and presented the law "Regulations on Foreign Exchange Regulation" to the [[National Assembly (Azerbaijan)|Parliament of Azerbaijan]].

Under the leadership of Akhundov, a new national payment system and the first payments balance of the country were introduced. As the Chairman of the Board of the Baku Interbank Currency Exchange, he organized the first auction, which laid the foundation for the inter-bank [[foreign exchange market]]. In 1995, Fuad Akhundov headed the International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA). By 2001, the IBA had become the leading bank in the Republic of Azerbaijan, with a market share estimated at 2/3 of the country's banking capital, and with about 50% of retail deposits.

In 1996 the bank launched a [[credit card]]s program, Azerbaijan's first [[automated teller machine|ATM]] was installed the same year, and the first international credit cards were issued in 1997. Later, the IBA served over 2 million cardholders and controlled 90% of the country's market. As a strategy for [[retail banking]] operations, the scheme of payment of utility bills was launched in Azerbaijan's capital, the city of Baku, in 2000. The bank was recognized as the best regional bank in the CIS ([[Commonwealth of Independent States]]) in the field of management, and as the bank with the best management information system and IT system in the CIS countries.&lt;ref&gt;Source: Information Memorandum of KPMG on the privatization of the IBA&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Euromoney]]'' magazine, it was recognized as the "Best Bank in Azerbaijan" in 1998, 1999, 2000, and was nominated "Bank of the Year" in ''Banker'' magazine. In 1998, Thomson Financial Bankwatch awarded the IBA with a credit rating; it was the first company in the history of Azerbaijan to receive an international credit rating.

Since 2001, Akhundov has been the Chief Executive Director and First Vice President of Nikoil Finance Corporation ([[Moscow]]). In August 2001, he led the team on the acquisition of Industrial Insurance Company (now "Uralsib-Insurance"), which was an insurance company in Russia at the time. In November 2001, Akhundov led the team in the acquisition of Autobank (tenth place among retail banks in Russia). In July 2003, Akhundov began heading the working committee for the integration of Nikoil Group and the acquired Autobank. He was Chairman of the Committee for the Investment and Underwriting in the Autobank-Nikoil Financial Corporation. As the chairman of the investment committee he was directly involved in the acquisition of [[Kopeyka (supermarket)|Kopeyka]], one of the largest Russian retail chains, by Nikoil.

In summer 2003, he began negotiations with the shareholders of the Bank Uralsib, which held the top 5 in all-Russian rankings at the time. Uralsib had an extensive regional network, with over 300 branches in 80 cities of Russia. In November 2003, Nikoil Group acquired a 15% stake in Uralsib through a privatization auction held by the State Property Fund, and a few weeks later Akhundov closed a transaction for a 57% stake in the bank. Another 3.5% stake was purchased on the open market, and the share in the equity of Uralsib increased to 75 + 1%, which allowed him to head the Management Board of the bank. In December 2003, Akhundov was appointed President and Chairman of the Management Board of the Bank Uralsib JSC.

From February 2004 to the end of 2005 he managed the merger of the Autobank-Nikoil FC and the Bank Uralsib. By the end of 2005, the consolidated Uralsib Financial Corporation increased its assets by almost 10 times, and took the 5th place in the DCM. It was also among the three leading private banks and asset management companies. The Uralsib FC was among the top five research teams, according to the rating of Thompson-Extel, was the seventh among the banks engaged in retail, and the tenth among the creditors of corporations in the Russian Federation.

In 2006, Akhundov founded and headed the United Capital Investment Group and served as a member of the Supervisory Board in the Silkroutefinancial Foundation ([[London]]).

Fuad Akhundov led the team which achieved approval for the first Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Side Parameters Report (SPR) for a nuclear power plant in Turkey.  Under Akhundov's leadership, Akkuyu Nuclear undertook a so-called "multi-lot" construction strategy which later became a foundational strategy for bringing outside investors into the project.

In 2016 Akhundov founded Independent Energy Fund, a fund whose primary focus is financing Rosatom's foreign expansion.

He continues to lead Akkuyu Nuclear in the capacity of the Deputy Chairman of the Board.

The '''future map''' is a method for building scenarios based on the collection of anticipated events.

The concept is based on the idea that a group of people who integrate the partial visions of its members into a common, shared, discussed, large enough, collection of anticipated events it can eventually reveal its own "shared future".

Because the [[Policy Analysis Market|FutureMap]] methodology is dynamic and implemented on a [[wiki]]-platform the Future projected by the group is constantly under revision. By process, the community learns how to adapt to future changes and increases its ability to face "unexpected events", it improves what the author calls its '''future-readiness'''.

'''Georges Hobeika''' ([[Baskinta]], 8 February 1962) is a [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] [[fashion designer]] of [[haute couture]] and [[ready-to-wear]] clothing. Hobeika officially opened his atelier in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]] in 1995, and has been presenting his collections in [[Paris]], during the city’s official [[Paris Fashion Week|fashion weeks]], for over a decade. Hobeika is officially recognized by the "[[List of grands couturiers|Chambre Syndicale de la Haute Couture]]", as a guest member.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fashionwindows.net/2009/11/georges-hobeika/&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Hobeika owns and manages his fashion house which includes four lines: Georges Hobeika Couture – Georges Hobeika Bridal – Georges Hobeika Signature – GH by Georges Hobeika. Georges Hobeika operates the fashion label from his showroom on the [[rue Royale]] in Paris and from his atelier headquarters in Beirut.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1037404/interview-georges-hobeikas-new-couture&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

Hobeika was born in [[Baskinta]], a village in the mountains of Lebanon, and was one of eight siblings. His mother, Marie, was a seamstress and encouraged her children to assist her in her boutique atelier. Hobeika particularly liked his mother’s vocation and pursued it as a passionate hobby.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ultraextra.org/interviews/2012/12/7/9vrjaj3ds463h1bnk8435uzsnmmpqt&lt;/ref&gt;

Hobeika studied civil engineering in university, and pursued architectural design in his studies. The [[Lebanese Civil War]] forced him to leave the country in order to secure a better future for him and his family. Hobeika traveled to Paris and worked as an intern for several Parisian fashion houses, including [[Chanel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://jetsetfashionmagazine.com/wordpress/fashion/my-interview-with-georges-hobeika&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Georges Hobeika Design Label ==
After returning from Paris, Georges Hobeika opened his first atelier location in Beirut, Lebanon in 1995. Around this time, his mother closed her atelier and referred all of her clients to him. They worked together to establish a fashion label.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.modemonline.com/fashion/mini-web-sites/fashion-brands/references/georgeshobeika&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Hobeika had his first show in Paris, at "Hotel K,". Hobeika has shown his couture collections in every biannual [[Paris Fashion Week|Paris Couture Fashion Week]] since.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.poshglam.com/georges-hobeika-a-paris/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Intellectual property}}
Layout designs (topographies) of [[integrated circuit]]s are a field in the protection of [[intellectual property]].

In [[United States]] intellectual property law, a "mask work" is a two or three-dimensional layout or topography of an [[integrated circuit]] (IC or "chip"), i.e. the arrangement on a chip of [[semiconductor devices]] such as [[transistor]]s and passive [[electronics|electronic]] components such as [[resistor]]s and interconnections. The layout is called a ''mask'' work because, in [[photolithography|photolithographic]] processes, the multiple etched layers within actual ICs are each created using a mask, called the [[photomask]], to permit or block the light at specific locations, sometimes for hundreds of chips on a [[wafer (electronics)|wafer]] simultaneously.

Because of the functional nature of the mask geometry, the designs cannot be effectively protected under [[copyright]] law (except perhaps as decorative art). Similarly, because individual lithographic mask works are not clearly protectable subject matter, they also cannot be effectively protected under [[patent]] law, although any processes implemented in the work may be patentable. So since the 1990s, national governments have been granting copyright-like exclusive rights conferring time-limited exclusivity to reproduction of a particular layout. Term of integrated circuit rights are usually shorter than copyrights applicable on pictures.

== International law ==

A diplomatic conference was held at [[Washington, D.C.]], in 1989, which adopted a [[Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits]], also called the Washington Treaty or IPIC Treaty. The Treaty, signed at Washington on May 26, 1989, is open to States Members of [[WIPO]] or the [[United Nations]] and to intergovernmental organizations meeting certain criteria. The Treaty has been incorporated by reference into the [[TRIPS Agreement]] of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), subject to the following modifications: the term of protection is at least 10 (rather than eight) years from the date of filing an application or of the first commercial exploitation in the world, but Members may provide a term of protection of 15 years from the creation of the layout-design; the exclusive right of the right-holder extends also to articles incorporating integrated circuits in which a protected layout-design is incorporated, in so far as it continues to contain an unlawfully reproduced layout-design; the circumstances in which layout-designs may be used without the consent of right-holders are more restricted; certain acts engaged in unknowingly will not constitute infringement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wto.int/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm#6 TRIPS Articles]&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPIC Treaty is currently not in force, but was partially integrated into the TRIPS agreement.

Article 35 of TRIPS in Relation to the IPIC Treaty states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Members agree to provide protection to the layout-designs (topographies) of integrated circuits (referred to in this Agreement as "layout-designs") in accordance with Articles 2 through 7 (other than paragraph 3 of Article 6), Article 12 and paragraph 3 of Article 16 of the Treaty on Intellectual Property in Respect of Integrated Circuits and, in addition, to comply with the following provisions.[http://www.wto.int/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm#6 TRIPS Document]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 2 of the IPIC Treaty gives the following definitions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(i) 'integrated circuit' means a product, in its final form or an intermediate form, in which the elements, at least one of which is an active element, and some or all of the inter-connections are integrally formed in and/or on a piece of material and which is intended to perform an electronic function,

(ii) 'layout-design (topography)' means the three-dimensional disposition, however expressed, of the elements, at least one of which is an active element, and of some or all of the interconnections of an integrated circuit, or such a three-dimensional disposition prepared for an integrated circuit intended for manufacture ...
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under the IPIC Treaty, each Contracting Party is obliged to secure, throughout its territory, exclusive rights in layout-designs (topographies) of integrated circuits, whether or not the integrated circuit concerned is incorporated in an article. Such obligation applies to layout-designs that are original in the sense that they are the result of their creators' own intellectual effort and are not commonplace among creators of layout designs and manufacturers of integrated circuits at the time of their creation.

The Contracting Parties must, as a minimum, consider the following acts to be unlawful if performed without the authorization of the holder of the right: the reproduction of the lay-out design, and the importation, sale or other distribution for commercial purposes of the layout-design or an integrated circuit in which the layout-design is incorporated. However, certain acts may be freely performed for private purposes or for the sole purpose of evaluation, analysis, research or teaching.

== National laws ==

=== United States ===

The United States Code (USC) defines a mask work as "a series of related images, however fixed or encoded, having or representing the predetermined, three-dimensional pattern of metallic, insulating, or semiconductor material present or removed from the layers of a semiconductor chip product, and in which the relation of the images to one another is such that each image has the pattern of the surface of one form of the semiconductor chip product" [(17 U.S.C. § 901(a)(2))]. Mask work exclusive rights were first granted in the US by the [[Semiconductor Chip Protection Act of 1984]].

According to {{UnitedStatesCode|17|904}}, rights in semiconductor mask works last 10 years. This contrasts with a [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act|term of 95 years]] for modern copyrighted works with a corporate authorship; alleged infringement of mask work rights are also not protected by a statutory [[fair use]] defense, nor by the typical [[backup]] copy exemptions that {{UnitedStatesCode|17|117}} provides for [[computer software]]. Nevertheless, as fair use in copyrighted works was originally recognized by the judiciary over a century before being codified in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], it is possible that the courts might likewise find a similar defense applies to mask work.

The non-obligatory symbol used in a mask work protection notice is Ⓜ ([[M]] enclosed in a circle; [[Unicode]] code point &lt;code&gt;U+24C2&lt;/code&gt; or [[Unicode and HTML|HTML numeric character entity]] &lt;code&gt;&amp;amp;#9410;&lt;/code&gt;) or *M*.

The exclusive rights in a mask work are somewhat like those of [[copyright]]: the right to reproduce the mask work or (initially) distribute an IC made using the mask work. Like the [[first sale doctrine]], a lawful owner of an authorized IC containing a mask work may freely import, distribute or use, but not reproduce the chip (or the mask). Mask work protection is characterized as a ''[[sui generis]]'' right, i.e., one created to protect specific rights where other (more general) laws were inadequate or inappropriate.

Note that the exclusive rights granted to mask work owners are more limited than those granted to copyright or patent holders. For instance, modification (derivative works) is not an exclusive right of mask work owners. Similarly, the exclusive right of a patentee to "use" an invention would not prohibit an independently created mask work of identical geometry. Furthermore, reproduction for [[reverse engineering]] of a mask work is specifically permitted by the law. As with copyright, mask work rights exist when they are created, regardless of registration, unlike patents, which only confer rights after application, examination and issuance.

Mask work rights have more in common with copyrights than with other [[exclusive right]]s such as [[patent]]s or [[trademark]]s. On the other hand, they are used alongside copyright to protect a [[read-only memory]] (ROM) component that is encoded to contain computer software.

The publisher of software for a cartridge-based [[video game console]] may seek simultaneous protection of its property under several legal constructs:

* A trademark registration on the game's title and possibly other marks such as fanciful names of worlds and characters used in the game (e.g., PAC-MAN®);
* A copyright registration on the program as a literary work or on the audiovisual displays generated by the work; and
* A mask work registration on the ROM that contains the binary.

Ordinary copyright law applies to the underlying software (source, binary) and original characters and art.
But the expiration date for the term of ''additional'' exclusive rights in a work distributed in the form of a mask ROM would depend on an {{as of|2010|alt=as yet}} untested interpretation of the originality requirement of § 902(b):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(b) Protection under this chapter (i.e., as a mask work) shall not be available for a mask work that—
:(1) is not original; or
:(2) consists of designs that are staple, commonplace, or familiar in the semiconductor industry, or variations of such designs, combined in a way that, considered as a whole, is not original
({{UnitedStatesCode|17|902}}, {{As of|2010|11|lc=y}}).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Under one interpretation, a mask work containing a given game title is either entirely unoriginal, as mask ROM in general is likely a familiar design, or a minor variation of the mask work for any of the [[launch title|first titles released for the console]] in the region.

=== Other countries ===

Equivalent legislation exists in [[Australia]], [[India]] and [[Hong Kong]].

Australian law refers to mask works as "eligible layouts" or ELs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|FCA|584|1992|litigants=Re Centronics Systems Pty Ltd; Maurice Latin; Tiberio Salice and Fabrizio Latin v Nintendo Company Ltd |parallelcite=(1992) 39 [[Federal Court Reports|FCR]] 147 |date=1 December 1992 |courtname=[[Federal Court of Australia|Federal Court (Full Court)]] |juris=Australia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Canada]] these rights are protected under the [Integrated Circuit Topography Act (1990, c. 37)].

In the [[European Union]], a ''sui generis'' design right protecting the design of materials was introduced by the [[Directive 87/54/EEC]] which is transposed in all member states.

[[India]] has the Semiconductor Integrated Circuits Layout Design Act, 2000 for the similar protection.

[[Japan]] relies on "The Act Concerning the Circuit Layout of a Semiconductor Integrated Circuit".

[[Brazil]] has enacted Law No. 11484, of 2007, to regulate the protection and registration of integrated circuit topography.

The '''International Color Consortium''' ('''ICC''') was formed in 1993 by eight vendors in order to create an open, vendor-neutral [[color management]] system which would function transparently across all [[operating system]]s and software packages.

The ICC specification, currently on version 4.3,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.color.org/specification/ICC1v43_2010-12.pdf Specification ICC.1:2010-12 ], 2010 revision of the [[ICC profile]] standard&lt;/ref&gt; allows for matching of [[color]] when moved between applications and [[operating system]]s, from the point of creation to the final output, whether display or print.  This specification is technically identical to ISO 15076-1:2010, available from [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]].

The [[ICC profile]] which describe the color attributes of a particular device or viewing requirement by defining a mapping between the source or target [[color space]] and a ''profile connection space'' (PCS).

The ICC defines the format precisely but does not define algorithms or processing details. This means there is room for variation between different applications and systems that work with ICC profiles.

ICC has also published a preliminary specification for iccMAX, a next-generation color management architecture with significantly expanded functionality and a choice of colorimetric, spectral or material connection space. Details are at [http://www.color.org/iccmax/index.xalter http://www.color.org/iccmax/]

'''John Bowe''', former Head of Capital Markets at [[Anglo Irish Bank]], born c. 1963.

==Background==

A native of [[County Laois]], Bowe was Director of Capital Markets of Anglo Irish Bank Corp. PLC (known as Irish Bank Resolution Corporation Limited). Other positions he held include NOL Group's businesses and operations in the US, Canada and Latin America, and President of Americas of NOL Group of Neptune Orient Lines Ltd.

Bowe became a number of former members of Anglo Irish Bank who were at the centre of a controversy in June 2013, concerning recorded comments they made some years previously in matters during the run-up to Ireland's economic crisis. His comments included:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If they saw the enormity of it up front, they might decide they have a choice. You know what I mean?
“They might say the cost to the taxpayer is too high…if it doesn’t look too big at the outset…if it doesn’t look big, big enough to be important, but not too big that it kind of spoils everything, then, then I think you can have a chance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2013, upon the release of the recordings, Bowe categorically denied misleading the Irish government in the lead-up to the bailout:

In a statement issued in, Mr. Bowe said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I categorically deny the allegation that I, at any time, misled the Central Bank or was aware of any strategy to do so. There were extensive discussions with the Central Bank particularly in or around the time period of September 2008. The phone call on 18 September 2008 was three days after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, and therefore took place during a period of severe and unprecedented market dislocation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conviction==
In June 2017 he was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud and sentenced to two years in prison the following month.&lt;ref name=bbc-anglo-irish-bank-former-executives-jailed&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-36922730|title=Anglo Irish Bank: Former executives jailed over fraud|publisher=[[BBC News]]|last=Campbell|first=John|date=29 July 2016|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rte-bank-executives-convicted&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/2016/0729/805610-bank-executives/|title=Three former bank executives sentenced over €7.2bn conspiracy |publisher=[[RTE News]]|date=29 July 2016|accessdate=7 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same trial, Denis Casey was sentenced to two years and nine months and Willie McAteer was sentenced to three and a half years.&lt;ref name=bbc-anglo-irish-bank-former-executives-jailed/&gt;&lt;ref name=rte-bank-executives-convicted/&gt; 

The fraud consisted of Anglo Irish Bank lending €7.2bn to [[Irish Life|Irish Life and Permanent]], which placed the same sum back with Anglo Irish Bank, where it was accounted for on and end of year balance sheet as customer deposits instead of an inter-bank loan.&lt;ref name=bbc-anglo-irish-bank-former-executives-jailed/&gt;

The trial lasted 89 days and was the longest trial in the history of the state at that time.&lt;ref name=rte-bank-executives-convicted/&gt;

'''Joško Svaguša''' (born 11 January 1972 in [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]) is a [[Croatia]]n entrepreneur, former politician and former president of the Croatian football club [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]].

Svaguša graduated from the high school of tourism in Split. During the early 1990s, he went to [[Germany]] and worked in the [[Port of Hamburg]] for 3 years. He returned to Split in 1994 and opened a bakery with his father Mirko Svaguša. The bakery was called ''Svaguša'' and after some years it became a major bakery company with stores all around [[Dalmatia]].
In 2003, Joško Svaguša bought ''Bobis'', a major company that specialises in sweets.&lt;ref name="'nacional.hr"&gt;http://arhiva.nacional.hr/clanak/21402/splitski-kralj-kruha/&lt;/ref&gt;

Svaguša started attracting public fame in 2009 when he joined his friend [[Željko Kerum]] in an attempt to win the local elections in Split. Željko Kerum won the elections and became mayor of Split with Svaguša becoming an alderman in the Split city council.

Svaguša gained the public spotlight in August 2009 when he became the president of [[Hajduk Split]], the biggest sporting institution in Croatia. He was put there under the orders of Željko Kerum and in November 2009, Kerum created a supervisory board in Hajduk which was made up of only his closest friends. It sparked a revolt amongst Hajduk fans who demanded democracy and transparency in the club.

Svaguša made his first move by buying [[Anas Sharbini]] and [[Ahmad Sharbini]] for a fee of 2,3 million euros which was the highest fee that Hajduk ever paid on the market for a player. He managed to get [[Edoardo Reja]] as manager which was seen as an extraordinary accomplishment.

In February 2010, Reja left Hajduk and Svaguša got [[Stanko Poklepović]] as manager. Stanković won the [[2009–10 Croatian Football Cup]] which was Hajduks first trophy in 5 years. Svaguša gained controversy when it was reported that he gave himself almost 100,000 euros of the clubs money as a bonus for winning the cup.

In August 2010, Hajduk managed to qualify for the [[2010–11 UEFA Europa League]]. It was regarded as Hajduks greatest European achievement in the last 15 years. In October 2010, Poklepović was sacked for underperforming in the league and dropping out of the cup. Mayor Željko Kerum demanded that [[Goran Vučević]] be the new manager. Svaguša appointed Vučević but was not satisfied. Hajduk dropped out of the Europa league with 5 defeats and 1 win that season. In December 2010, Svaguša resigned as president.&lt;ref name="'novilist.hr"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.novilist.hr/Sport/Nogomet/HNL/Svagusa-pismeno-podnio-ostavku-Grbic-privremeni-predsjednik/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217144801/http://www.novilist.hr/Sport/Nogomet/HNL/Svagusa-pismeno-podnio-ostavku-Grbic-privremeni-predsjednik/# |archive-date=2017-02-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While president of Hajduk Split, Svaguša faced a revolt from the Hajduk fans. In October 2009, the fans boycotted the derby against [[Dinamo Zagreb]] which was the first ever event of that kind at Hajduk. Svaguša was perceived as a person who did not understand the job at Hajduk and at times faced criminal accusations. In 2015, he was under investigation for damaging the club with changing the players contracts during his presidency.&lt;ref name="'index.hr"&gt;http://www.index.hr/mobile/clanak.aspx?category=sport&amp;id=831418/{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Joško Svaguša closed the ''Svaguša'' company and transferred all assets to ''Bobis''. His company faced a major financial loss and in 2015, businessman Tomislav Mamić bought 50%  of ''Bobis'' shares for 3 million euros. Joško Svaguša still remains the company director.&lt;ref name="'slobodnadalmacija.hr"&gt;http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/novosti/biznis/clanak/id/264390/nema-vise-svaguse-tomislav-mamic-kupio-pola-bobisa-za-3-milijuna-eura/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karol Franciszek Pollak''' (November 15, 1859 – December 17, 1928) was a [[Polish people|Polish]] [[electrotechnician]], [[inventor]] and [[businessman]].

== Early life ==
He was born in [[Sanok]], [[Poland]]. His father was Karol Pollak (1818–80) who was a [[printer (publishing)|printer]], bookseller and publisher, well known in [[Sanok]]. Karol (not to be mistaken with his father) worked in his youth as an [[electrician]] and showed great technical skills in it. In 1883 he was employed in the laboratory of British company "The Patent Utilisation Co". He designed and recorded his first patents in that period. In 1885 he attended [[electrotechnics]] studies at the [[Berlin Institute of Technology|Royal Polytechnic University in Charlottenburg]].

== Activity ==
In Berlin, Pollak ran electrotechnical factory "G. Wehr Telegraphen-Bau-Anstalt". Later he returned to Britain to commercialize his patents, which were released under anglicised version of his name, "Charles Pollak". In 1886, he became the director of a Paris company of electric tramways of his design. In the meantime he worked on the design of [[Electrochemical cell]]. He was very successful in this topic and it made him famous. Later he founded battery factories in [[Frankfurt]], [[Germany]] and [[Liesing]], [[Austria]]. Many  battery-manufacturing companies have licensed his designs.

In 1899 he founded his own laboratory and proceeded with further research. He obtained 98 patents on his inventions.

In 1922 he returned to [[Poland]], where a year later he founded a factory in [[Biała Krakowska|Biała]], which exists to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.www.hawker.pl/pl/fabryka Fabryka Akumulatorów EnerSys Sp. z o.o]&lt;/ref&gt; The company started under the name of ''Polskie Towarzystwo Akumulatorowe'' and was co-founded by professor and president of [[Poland]], [[Ignacy Mościcki]]. However, Pollak was the first president of this company.

Pollak is sometimes referred as the ''Edison of Poland''. In 1925 he received the title [[Doctor Honoris Causa|doctor honoris causa]] of [[Warsaw Polytechnic|Warsaw University of Technology]].

== Most important inventions ==
[[File:Pollak akumulator.jpg|thumb|150px|Battery constructed by Karol Pollak]]
His numerous inventions also cover other areas, among them: [[electric motor]]s, [[color printing]] device, and a type of [[microphone]]. His main activity was related to [[chemical energy|chemical sources of energy]] - [[galvanic cell]]s and batteries. He obtained a patent for manufacturing [[Lead acid battery|lead-acid batteries]].

[[File:Pollak bridge.png|thumb|250px|Design of full rectifier included in Karol Pollak patent]]
He also has designed [[Rectifier|commutator and electrolytic rectifiers]]. In 1895 he was the first to suggest the use of [[Diode bridge|full bridge diode rectification circuit]],&lt;ref&gt;British patent [https://archive.is/20130807121725/https://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?window=1&amp;space=menu&amp;content=treffer&amp;action=bibdat&amp;docid=GB000189524398A 24398]&lt;/ref&gt; later known by [[Leo Graetz]]. In 1896, Pollak invented the [[electrolytic capacitor]]&lt;ref&gt;German patent [http://depatisnet.dpma.de/DepatisNet/depatisnet?action=pdf&amp;docid=DE000000092564A D.R.P. 92564].&lt;/ref&gt;

Klipfolio offers an online dashboard platform for building real-time business dashboards. It allows business users to connect to many data services, automate data retrieval, and then manipulate, and visualize the data. Klipfolio uses a schema-less architecture that allows non-technical end users to more easily connect to data sources, and separates data from presentation to more efficiently use and reuse data sources throughout the platform.

Klipfolio has built-in formula editing, allowing end-users to transform, combine, slice, and filter any data before visualizing it. Users are able to access the dashboard from their desktop, tablet, TV, and mobile phone, and share it with colleagues by granting access to the dashboard, or by scheduling email reports.
&lt;!--
'''Klipfolio Dashboard''' is a [[performance indicator|KPI]] [[Dashboards (management information systems)|dashboard]] for [[Microsoft Windows]]. The program uses dashboard modules, called [[Klip]]s to display KPIs (key performance indicators) and information that a user or organization chooses to see at all times.

Klipfolio Dashboard appears as an [[widget engine|enterprise widget]] which can take the form of a top bar, bottom bar, [[Sidebar (computing)|sidebar]], or a floating widget. The application installs with a variety of common [[Klip]]s though many more are available for download.

[[Klip]]s can be moved, resized, and reordered by the user. Alternatively, enterprise IT departments can "lock down" part or all of the Klips or the look and feel of Klipfolio Dashboard to guarantee that users are presented with the KPIs prioritized by the business.

Klips can present and sort data in columns, bar charts, interactive pie charts, and spark lines. Mousing over any data point triggers additional background information to appear in a fly out and clicking can take a user directly to the underlying enterprise data system with no additional log in required.

'''Klipfolio Publisher''' is a secure, hosted, and real-time messaging and alerting system that lets managers and communicators notify colleagues and coworkers without IT intervention. The author can choose both the timing and severity of their published messages. For example, an internal communications user could schedule a notification and link to an important new press release or announcement to arrive at the same time as the news is issued to the market. Depending on how important the announcement is, the alert may appear as passive news within Klipfolio Dashboard or as a highly visible alert on the desktop that requires user acknowledgment.

'''Klips''' are [[XML]] files that contain [[Markup language|markup]], styles and [[JavaScript]] and provide the Klipfolio Dashboard platform with rules for the retrieval, interpretation, and presentation of arbitrary information sources such as [[Flat file database|flat file]] formatted data, [[XML]] based data feeds, [[relational database]]s and [[Online analytical processing|multi-dimensional databases/OLAP]], in order to increase the visibility of business critical data.

Klipfolio offers an [[Software development kit|SDK]] for developers who wish to write Klips for Klipfolio Dashboard. An official [http://www.klipfolio.com/blog/ Klipblog] and [http://developer.klipfolio.com/ developer section] has been created to support Klip developers

== Technical ==

Klipfolio Dashboard includes a [[JavaScript]] based [[Markup language#Descriptive markup|semantic markup language]] which creates relationships among disparate bits of data, helps to present these data bits in a consistent manner, and allows a developer to create and modify Klips. Employing a semantic markup language also makes Klipfolio Dashboard portable: appropriate context for the data it presents can be maintained on the [[Virtual desktop|desktop]], on a mobile device, or even via an automated voice system.

The application is built using proprietary internal systems including an [[XML]] [[Parsing|parser]] and [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] stack along with tailor made image scaling and [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] decoding. These developments were all designed to fit within a core code package that is still less than 500 [[Kilobyte|KB]].

Klipfolio Dashboard also includes [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]-based matching architecture to aid in the semantic markup of structured data based on [[HTML]] and [[XML]].

Serence is the former name of a Canadian corporation known for its [[Klipfolio|Klipfolio Dashboard]] [[Performance indicator|KPI]] dashboards or enterprise dashboards, formed in 2001, when Allan Wille ([[Chief executive officer|CEO]]) and Peter Matthews (Chief Experience Officer — CXO) pursued their vision of a simple application that assembles current information from multiple sources into a single, consistent, and coherent presentation format. Wille and Matthews were joined by James Scott ([[Chief technical officer|CTO]]).

The first version of Klipfolio Dashboard appeared later that year. As an early [[News aggregator|RSS reader]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2004/05/63538?currentPage=all|title=A Scan of the Headline Scanners|website=Wired.com|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loosewireblog.com/2004/08/a_directory_of_-10.html|title=A Directory of The Best RSS readers|date=9 August 2004|website=Loosewireblog.com|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.cnet.com/8301-2007_4-10247064-12.html|title=Top RSS readers - The Download Blog - CNET Download.com|website=download.cnet.com|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it used the technology to populate its various [[Klip]]s.

In 2002, the application evolved to include a [[JavaScript]]-based semantic [[markup language]] which created relationships among disparate bits of data, presented data more consistently, and allowed a developer to create and modify [[Klip]]s. Additionally, the company adopted a clean design philosophy.

To avoid various integration and performance challenges associated with off-the-shelf code, the research and development team opted for proprietary internal systems including an [[XML parser]], [[HTTP]] stack and novel [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]-based matching architecture. These developments were all designed to fit within a core code package less than 500 [[Kilobyte|KB]].

Klipfolio Dashboard was among the first branded desktop applications (known today as [[Rich Internet application|Rich Internet Applications]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

By 2007, the company's primary focus had shifted&lt;ref&gt;Serence's World of Widgets. Barbara Brynko. Information Today volume 24, n11, p.26 (2). Print December 2007. ISSN 8755-6286&lt;/ref&gt; to the operational [[business intelligence]] market. For enterprise, Klipfolio Dashboard is used to increase the visibility of business-critical information of [[key performance indicators]] (KPI) from different corporate databases and applications.

In 2008, Serence rebranded the company as Klipfolio Inc. to take advantage of brand recognition of Klipfolio Dashboard in the marketplace. The move reflected an increased emphasis by the firm on the enterprise or business dashboard market.

In late 2011, Klipfolio launched Klipfolio Dashboard as a cloud-hosted service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obj.ca/Technology/2012-04-23/article-2954559/%26lsquo%3BWe%26rsquo%3Bre-not-building-a-company-to-be-acquired%26rsquo%3B/1] {{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kopiko Candy has also been consumed by astronauts on the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mayora.com/news/news/kopiko-far-beyond-just-a-coffee-candy/ International Space Station]&lt;/ref&gt;

A second variety is kosher, supervised by the [[KF Federation of Synagogues]] in London, UK. The second variety is no longer kosher certified by the KF Kosher Federation, though there might be products on the market, with Cholov Yisroel.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} 

==Ingredients==

The product contains extract from real coffee beans. Ingredients include sugar, glucose, coconut oil, coffee extract (4.9%), butter, soy lecithin, caramel color, salt, natural coffee flavour. 

==Flavors==

Two different flavors are available, original coffee and [[cappuccino]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kopiko.co.uk/ourproducts.htm Kopiko UK]&lt;/ref&gt; The candy has a hard, smooth texture.

==Caffeine Content==

The Kopiko UK website advises "4-5 sweets contain the caffeine equivalent of a cup of espresso" for the original coffee flavor, while the cappuccino flavor sweets contain "around half the caffeine" of the original coffee flavor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kopiko.co.uk/ourproducts.htm Kopiko UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Caffeine Informer website estimates the caffeine content of the original coffee flavor to be "about 20-25 mg per piece since usually a cup of coffee is referring to 100 mg of caffeine."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.caffeineinformer.com/caffeine-content/kopiko Caffeine Informer: Kopiko]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3170">'''Lee Chik-yuet''' ({{zh-t|李植悅}}; born 20 May 1954) is a Hong Kong social worker, lawyer, politician and businessman. He is the former member of the [[Urban Council of Hong Kong]] and member of the [[Sham Shui Po District Board]].

Lee was born on 20 May 1954 in [[Shantou]], [[Guangzhou]] and moved to Hong Kong in 1961 during the [[Great Famine of China]]. He graduated from the [[Shau Kei Wan Government Secondary School]] and attended the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]] in 1975. He was involved in student activism at the time, including the editorial works at the student newspaper. He was under influence of [[Tsang Shu-ki]], the prominent theorist of the "social action faction" at the time who introduced him [[New Left]], [[existentialist]] and [[Frankfurt School]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tsangwongfoundation.org/%E6%B0%B8%E9%81%A0%E6%87%B7%E5%BF%B5%E6%9B%BE%E6%BE%8D%E5%9F%BA%EF%BC%81/|title=永遠懷念曾澍基！|author=李植悅}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After being graduated in 1979 with a Bachelor's Degree in Social Science, Lee became social worker at the Hong Kong Christian Social Service, serving at [[Lei Cheng Uk Estate]] in [[Sham Shui Po]]. He first contested in the [[Hong Kong municipal election, 1983|first reformed Urban Council election]] in 1983 alongside [[Frederick Fung]]. In 1983, he became a member of [[Meeting Point]], the first political group to publicly support Chinese sovereignty of Hong Kong after 1997. He was re-elected to Urban Council in 1986 and did not seek re-election in 1989. He was also vice-chairman of Meeting Point under the chairmanship of [[Anthony Cheung]]. He supported [[Chris Patten]]'s [[1994 Hong Kong electoral reform|constitutional reform proposal]] which split in the party in half. In 1994, he became member of the first executive committee of the [[Democratic Party (Hong Kong)|Democratic Party]] when the new party was founded as a merger of the [[United Democrats of Hong Kong]] and Meeting Point.

In 1990 and 1994, Lee was graduated with a Bachelor's Degree and Masters Degree in Laws from the [[University of Hong Kong]] respectively. He provided legal consultations to various Chinese and Hong Kong companies. He is currently an executive director of the New Ray Medicine International Holding Limited and the Town Health International Medical Group Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lee, Chik Yuet 李植悅|work=Webb-site Who's Who|url=https://webb-site.com/dbpub/positions.asp?p=38670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahmud Dantata''' (1922–1983) was a Nigerian businessmen and politician who represented Kano East  under the platform of [[Northern People's Congress|NPC]] in the Nigerian House of Representatives from 1965 to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Ivan H.|title=Ethnic enterprise in America : business and welfare among Chinese, Japanese and Blacks|date=1972|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520024854|page=312|edition=3. pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dantata was originally sympathetic to the cause of the opposition party NEPU, led by Aminu Kano but after an incarceration, he aligned with the dominant party to defeat Aminu Kano for a seat in the House of Representatives in 1964.

==Life==
Dantata was born in the Sareri quarters of [[Kano]] in 1922. The son of [[Alhassan Dantata]], a wealthy merchant, Dantata completed his formal education at Achimota College, in Ghana. Thereafter, he joined his father's business in 1945. In 1949, he branched out on his own, setting up investments in an hotel, sugar mill and petrol stations. His hotel was built in Koki quarters of Kano, a predominantly Muslim quarters where earlier attempts to build an hotel had been rejected. By 1951, he started exploring ways to transport pilgrims by road through Sudan to Saudi Arabia. He co-founded a pilgrimage business which was known as West African Pilgrimage Association (WAPA), and acquired buses for the transportation of pilgrims. A year later, he started a chartered flight service to transport pilgrims from Kano. In the Fagge quarters of Kano, he reclaimed a swampy land to build WAPA house, the area later became known for currency trading. Dantata himself soon dedicated a section of his business to currency trading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hashim|first1=Yahaya|last2=Meagher|first2=Kate|title=Cross-border trade and the parallel currency market - trade and finance in the context of structural adjustment : a case study from Kano, Nigeria : [a report from the research programme The Political and Social Context of Structural Adjustment in Africa]|date=1999|publisher=Nordiska Afrikainstitutet|location=Uppsala|isbn=9171064494|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, he was charged with illegal printing of currency notes, he was found guilty and sentenced to 8 years imprisonment. After his release, he switched political allegiance to NPC and won a parliamentary election to represent Kano East. In 1967, WAPA house diversified into lodging, night club and cinema and the businesses where managed by Sabo Bakin Zuwo who later became Kano state's governor in 1983.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12252">'''Market information systems''' (otherwise known as '''market intelligence systems''', '''market information services''', or '''MIS''', and not to be confused with [[management information systems]]) are information systems used in gathering, analyzing and disseminating information about prices and other information relevant to farmers, animal rearers, traders, processors and others involved in handling agricultural products. Market information systems play an important role in agro-industrialisation and food [[supply chain]]s. With the advance of [[Information and communication technologies for development]] (ICTs) in developing countries, the income- generation opportunities offered by market information systems have been sought by international development organizations, [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) and businesses alike.

==Types of market information systems==
There is a wide variety of market information systems or services. [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] countries have traditionally emphasised the importance of information provision for the agricultural sector, a notable example being the service provided by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA). Such systems are widely used in order to increase the transparency and the volume of information flowing through the supply chains for different agricultural products. The ability of market information systems to provide a valuable service was strengthened with the development of the Internet and the advance of electronic commerce ([[business-to-business]] (B2B), [[consumer-to-consumer]], etc.). Industry structure, product complexity and the demanding nature of agricultural transactions are considered determining factors for the development of B2B [[electronic commerce]] in agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Leroux, Wortman Jr, and Mathias [http://www.ifama.org/tamu/iama/members/articles/v4i2/205-218.pdf Dominant Factors Impacting the Development of Business-to-Business (B2B)] e-Commerce in Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agricultural market information in developing countries==
In developing countries, market information initiatives are often part of broader interventions and part of the [[Agricultural Marketing|agricultural marketing]] and [[agribusiness]] development strategy that many governments are actively engaged in. It is commonly understood that long transaction chains, lack of transparency, lack of standards, and insufficient access to markets for products has perpetuated low incomes in predominantly agrarian economies. Early attempts at market information provision in developing countries involved government bodies in collecting price information, and arranging for this to be disseminated via newspapers and radio stations. The information provided was often not very accurate and usually reached farmers too late to be of practical use. Governments often attempted to cover far too many locations and many services either collapsed after initial donor assistance came to an end or managed to struggle along with little impact.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd, [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/003/x6993e/x6993e01.pdf Market Information Services: Theory and Practice], FAO, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Agricultural Market Information Systems: A literature review|last=FAO|first=|publisher=FAO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-5-109738-0|location=Rome|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Furthermore, it was soon recognised that it was not enough just to supply market information to farmers. They needed assistance in understanding how to use that information.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew W. Shepherd,  [ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/012/x8826e/x8826e00.pdf Understanding and Using Market Information.] FAO, Rome, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; However, donor organizations, such as [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation ACP-EU (CTA)|CTA]], [[International Institute for Communication and Development|IICD]], [[USAID]], [[DFID]], and the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]], remain committed to improving the efficiencies within the supply chain through greater information provision. The recent surge of [[mobile phone]] usage in developing countries has provided an opportunity for innovative projects to leverage this new distribution channel to get critical market data into the hands of farmers and traders, taking advantage of the [[Short Message Service|SMS]] capacity of phones. Using the so-called "push" method recipients of information are identified on a database and automatically receive messages of relevance to them. Alternatively, the "pull" method enables farmers and traders to interrogate the database of the MIS. A farmer can send an SMS with the product and location he is interested in (e.g. tomatoes;Nairobi) and receive an immediate reply. Several projects by [[Reuters]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reutersmarketlight.com/ Reuters Market Light, India]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nokia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nokia.com/NOKIA_COM_1/Microsites/Entry_Event/Materials/Nokia_Life_Tools_datasheet.pdf Nokia's Life Tools]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Esoko]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esoko.com Esoko]&lt;/ref&gt; KACE,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kace-kenya.com KACE Kenya]&lt;/ref&gt; Manobi,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manobi.sn Manobi]&lt;/ref&gt; AgRisk&lt;ref&gt;[http://agrisk.in Agrisk]&lt;/ref&gt; and others have demonstrated the impact that such information can have. Amongst donors there is a renewed interest in promoting regional trade, particularly in Africa, and market information is seen as an important way of achieving this. Examples of donor-supported services are  [http://www.ratin.net/ RATIN] for East Africa and  [http://www.resimao.net RESIMAO] for West Africa.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether MIS can be delivered on a profitable basis by the private sector, given the difficulty of fully covering costs, or on a sustainable basis by the public sector, given the latter's history of gathering inaccurate data and disseminating it badly.&lt;ref&gt;ICT in Agriculture, Module 9, [http://www.ictinagriculture.org/sourcebook/module-9-strengthening-agricultural-marketing] World Bank, Washington D.C. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shepherd|first1=Andrew|title=Assessing the quality of agricultural market information systems: A self-assessment guide|date=2018|publisher=FAO|location=Rome|isbn=978-92-5-130460-0|url=http://www.fao.org/documents/card/en/c/I8935EN|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To try to address some of these problems, a new approach makes the buyers responsible for uploading the price information via SMS, and facilitates trade by creating a capacity for sellers to contact individual buyers. Others question whether formal systems are still necessary when farmers can just contact traders by phone. Work in Bangladesh, India, China and Vietnam found that 80% of farmers now own cell phones and they use these to speak to multiple traders about prices and demand and to conclude deals.&lt;ref&gt;B.

Dato '''Mohamed Zaki''' (born 20 February 1953), also known as '''Nazaki Zaki''' or '''[[Sandhaanu]] Zaki''', is a businessman and politician in the [[Maldives]].

Zaki is the founder of Nazaki Services Pvt Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nazaki.com|title=NAZAKI GROUP OF COMPANIES|author=|date=|work=Nazaki.com|access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a company in the Maldives to the extent that all local news media refer to him as Nazaki Zaki.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140714193931/http://www.haveeru.com.mv/ambassadors/39383 Malaysian king confers Dato' title to Nazaki Zaki] &lt;/ref&gt; While being a businessman, he was also a part-time politician in the opposition party MDP [[Maldivian Democratic Party]]. He is among the few political figures in the Maldives who had stood up against a corrupt government during the time when there was no freedom of speech in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100522031729/http://en.rsf.org/list-of-the-13-internet-enemies-07-11-2006,19603 LIST OF THE 13 INTERNET ENEMIES - MALDIVES] &lt;/ref&gt; The struggle that he and others had undergone has made a political impact within four to five years.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 2007, Maldivians were able to speak openly against the government and the police without the fear of being arrested, beaten, or tortured.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} This was a complete change compared to 2003. In October 2008, the first Maldivian democratic presidential elections were held, where people voted for a change in government, causing the Maldivian Democratic Party presidential candidate [[Mohamed Nasheed]] to be the new incoming president.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} As government posts are decided by the president, Mohamed Zaki was appointed the new [[Maldives Ambassador to Malaysia]], Indonesia, Thailand and Brunei in 2008.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

During his youth, Zaki had struggled to earn money and support his family.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} However he had supported his wife (Nazima Asir) together with his five children and established one of the biggest companies in the Maldives.

His son [[Muad Mohamed Zaki]] has raised his political profile in the country after being one of the senior Maldivian Democratic Party member that was arrested in the military crackdown on peaceful protesters. The day of the crackdown was later labelled as Black Friday in the Maldives.

Both has moved on to give their support to a government that is based on national unity and Islam in the Maldives.

He has long-standing high political and business relations with the government led by President [[Abdulla Yameen]] and has given his support to the president's vision to develop the country. Zaki's political influence and credibility in the country has extended to the past two presidents before President Yameen. His backing of any president or political party has always been seen as a boost to their credibility in the eyes of many locals that respect him for his international achievements in life.

'''Pablo Tecson y Ocampo''' (July 4, 1858 – April 30, 1940) was an officer in the [[Philippine Revolution|Revolutionary Army]] serving under [[Gregorio del Pilar|Gen. Gregorio del Pilar]] (responsible for the eventual surrender of the Spanish forces) and a representative to the [[Revolutionary Government of the Philippines|Malolos Congress]].  He was elected the [[Governor General]] of [[Bulacan]] immediately following the [[Philippine–American War]]. Tecson later served as [[Secretary of Agriculture (Philippines)|Insular Secretary of the Philippine Bureau of Agriculture]].

==Early life and education==
Pablo Tecson was born July 4, 1859 in [[San Miguel, Bulacan|San Miguel de Mayumo]], Bulacan Province, [[Philippines]]; the son of Tiburcio Tecson and Paula Ocampo.  He studied in San Miguel and later, at the [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]] in [[Intramuros, Manila]] (where he finished his Bachelor of Arts program).

==Early career==
Tecson worked as a writer for a Spanish-era magazine, the "Catholic Periodical Guide" (''Pahayagan Patnubay ng Catolico''), in [[Malolos]], the county seat of Bulacan; its initial publication being in April 1890.

==Military action against Spain==
When the revolution against Spain broke out, Tecson was an officer in the Spanish Civil Guards (''Guardia Civil'') in San Miguel.

===Background===
In 1896, Tecson co-founded the Arao (''Balangay Arao'') branch of a secret society-turned-revolutionary government, the [[Katipunan]] (''Kataastaasang Kagalanggalangang Katipunan'', or ''KKK'')([[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''nang mga anak nang bayan''), which operated out of San Miguel.

On December 14, 1897 the [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]], was signed in Tecson's residence.  It called for a truce between Spanish Colonial Governor-General [[Fernando Primo de Rivera]], and insurgent leader, [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], to end the [[Philippine Revolution]].  Aguinaldo and his fellow revolutionaries were given amnesty and money and agreed to go into voluntary exile in [[Hong Kong]].  (Aguinaldo later used the money to purchase firearms.)  Following Aguinaldo's return from exile in [[Hong Kong]], Tecson defected from the Civil Guards and joined Aguinaldo's Republican Army as a captain.

Following the ''[[Cry of Nueva Ecija]]'', he fought alongside [[Manuel Tinio|General Manuel Tinio]] (especially in [[Nueva Ecija]]) and General [[Francisco Macabulos]].  He himself was eventually ranked brigadier general under del Pilar.

===Battle of San Miguel===
On May 24, 1898, Tecson launched attacks on the Spanish Civil Guard garrisons in San Miguel and [[San Rafael, Bulacan]] (collectively known as the [[Battle of San Miguel]]); which ended with the Spanish force's surrender on June 1, 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.baleria.com/index.php?body=article_baleria&amp;id_article=69 |title=Los ultimos de Filipinas. El regreso a Baler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wartime politics==
In 1898, Tecson represented the province of [[Cagayan]] at the Malolos Congress (which drafted the [[Malolos Constitution|Charter]] of the [[First Philippine Republic]]) a few months before the outbreak of the [[Philippine–American War|war with America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chanrobles.com/1899constitutionofthephilippines.htm |title=1899 Constitution - Chan Robles and Associates Law Firm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cast the [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|deciding vote]] which addressed the constitutional provision of the separation of church and state.&lt;ref name="bulacan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bulacan.gov.ph/generalinfo/governor.php?id=36 |title=Bulacan, Philippines: General Info: Provincial Governors: Pablo Tecson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military action against the United States==

===Battle of Quingua===
The [[Battle of Quingua]] was fought on April 23, 1899, in Quingua, Bulacan (now [[Plaridel, Bulacan|Plaridel]]), which resulted in a rout of the Filipinos by their former allies, the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="arl"&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Arlington National Cemetery Website: John M. Stotsenburg | url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jmstots.htm | accessdate = 2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and politics following the war==
Tecson was elected governor general of Bulacan—the first accepted under American rule, serving from 1902–1906.  In 1904, he was named as a delegate of the Philippine's Worlds Fair Commission. Tecson resigned from government service in 1906 and went into farming.  He was one of the first to promote the silk culture industry in the Philippines.  He returned to government service in 1907, becoming the Secretary of the [[Department of Agriculture (Philippines)|Department of Agriculture]].

==Philanthropy, legacy and death==
Tecson donated the land for the use of the [[Philippine Constabulary|Constabulary Station]] (''Barangay Sibul Spring'') in San Miguel.  This was later named [[1st Scout Ranger Regiment|Camp Tecson]].  Tecson died in 1933&lt;ref name="bulacan" /&gt; and is buried in San Miguel.  At his death, he donated land for a public burial ground for Filipino patriots.

Yama is the head of [[Yama Security Services]] Ltd, which is a subsidiary of his [[Yama Group]] of companies. He has an extensive property portfolio and owns the Smugglers Inn hotel in [[Madang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sundaychronicle.blogspot.com/2010/02/yama-threatens-to-sue-newspaper.html| title=Yama threatens to sue newspaper| author=Namatanai Electorate| publisher=Sunday Chronicle| date=22 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

Yama was referred to the [[Public Prosecutor]] on July 1997 amid allegations of misconduct which included, “improper application and failure to acquit EDF and other public funds, conflict of interest, using his position to obtain private a [sic] bank loan and attempting to purchase 2 ships from the government below market price”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.inapng.com/study_report_png_080703.pdf | title=TI Country Study Report | author=Fraud Management Studies Unit | publisher=National Integrity Systems | year=2003 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130320021506/http://www.inapng.com/study_report_png_080703.pdf | archivedate=2013-03-20 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The matter was then referred to a [[leadership tribunal]], which investigates alleged cases of misconduct by ministers and senior public officials, and which recommended the dismissal of Yama from his office in December 2004. This decision was ultimately overturned in February 2005 due to insufficient evidence on the majority of the counts. Yama was, however, fined K1000 for having been biased in his distribution of PGK1.6 million under the [[Rural Transport Development Program]] to his then Sumkar electorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postcourier.com.pg/20050207/news01.htm
| title=Yama cleared| author=Post Courier| publisher=Post Courier| date=7 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Yama issued a complaint against the State for PGK38.7 million, alleging that he had been prevented access to a piece of land leased to him in 1988. [[Attorney Genera]]l [[Zacchary Gelu]] awarded Yama a PGK15.5 million Deed of Settlement in compensation for lost earnings. However, in 2010 a government Commission of Inquiry found that Yama’s claim had been a fraudulent one, as it had failed to comply with mandatory procedural requirements and had been filed in respect of a plot of land that did not exist. The Commission referred Yama for criminal prosecution for making an unlawful claim and ordered that civil action be taken against Yama for unpaid land rentals to the effect of PGK61,015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://pngexposed.wordpress.com/?s=%22peter+yama%22 http://pngexposed.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/yama-and-gelu.pdf| title=Yama and Gelu conspired to steal K15.5m from the people of PNG| author= PNG Exposed Blog | publisher=PNG Exposed Blog| date=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Yama was awarded PGK7.6 million in a case against [[Motor Vehicle Insurance Limited]] for breach of contract. However, [[Bank of South Pacific]] (BSP) attempted to secure this money, claiming that Yama had outstanding debts. Yama denied that he had any existing debts with BSP and brought charges of fraud against the bank. Two [[Australian]] executives at BSP were subsequently arrested as a consequence of this action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.watoday.com.au/world/aussie-bankers-arrested-in-png-20100122-mp2m.html| title=Aussie bankers arrested in PNG| author=AAP| publisher=WAtoday| date=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executives, Robin Fleming and John Maddison, were subsequently released on bail. Australian law firm Gadens Lawyers, which represented BSP in the court action against Yama, were forced to withdraw their involvement in the case following physical threats to their legal team by armed groups in Port Moresby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solomonstarnews.com/news/regional/2154--law-firm-withdraws-from-png-fraud-case-after-threats

'''RW3 Technologies''' is a software company that provides [[SaaS]] field sales, survey, and reporting applications for the [[consumer packaged goods]] (CPG) industry.  It is headquartered in the Bay Area of California.

== History ==
RW3 Technologies was founded in the Bay Area by Bruce Nagle in 1992.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dvorak|first1=Phred|title=Do-It-Yourself Consulting: CEOs Gather to Swap Tips|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118541288405378455|accessdate=9 July 2015|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=26 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's primary focus was to streamline daily data entry processes for the sales industry.

In 1992, RW3 introduced one of the first Land-Line CPG broker sales systems that allowed for mobile data entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borrego|first1=Annie Marie|title=Start-up Springboards|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20001015/20778.html|website=Inc.|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially used in food brokerage, though eventually expanded to include functionality for the [[Consumer Packaged Goods|consumer packaged goods]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Costello|first1=Daniel|title=Curing An Open Wound|url=http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Older-Articles/The-Edge/Curing-An-Open-Wound-48561.aspx|website=Destination CRM|publisher=CRM Magazine|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the company expanded its [[business model]] to include [[B2B e-commerce|business-to-business]] account management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ackerman|first1=Alliston|title=National Tobacco Company Undergoes Sales Force Evolution|url=http://consumergoods.edgl.com/news/National-Tobacco-Company-Undergoes-Sales-Force-Evolution79917/|accessdate=24 July 2015|agency=Consumer Goods Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, the company began development of their first general [[SaaS]] product application since the late 1990s; the SaaS application called InStore Mobile (now MarketCheck) was released in 2011. The in-store survey application allows for two-way communication between the account rep and broker, allowing organizations to improve and track retail conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SMB Standout's - King's Hawaiian|url=http://www.consumergoods-digital.com/consumergoodstechnology/april_2015#pg7|accessdate=24 July 2015|agency=CGT|publisher=Edgell Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, RW3 released the BI Suite, a [[Business intelligence|business intelligence environment]] that enables rganizations to create views across departments and utilize multiple data sources to align sales strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Analytics Advantage|url=http://www.consumergoods-digital.com/consumergoodstechnology/november_2014#pg12|accessdate=24 July 2015|agency=Consumer Goods Technology|publisher=Edgell Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Smartcall was launched and marketed to the CPG industry.  The application enables field sales reps to conduct traditional store calls and manage sales routes.  It is packaged with MarketCheck into their InStore Execution Suite, providing retail execution and monitoring applications for the consumer goods industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hagemeyer|first1=Dale|title=Market Guide for Retail Execution and Monitoring Solutions for the Consumer Goods Industry|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2998123/market-guide-retail-execution-monitoring|website=Gartner|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5790">'''Robert Newton Anthony''' (September 6, 1916 – December 1, 2006) was an American organizational theorist, and professor of [[management control]] at [[Harvard Business School]], known for his work in the field of [[management control system]]s.&lt;ref name="TAHoF"&gt;[http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/robert-newton-anthony/ Robert Newton Anthony] in: ''The Accounting Hall of Fame.'' Accessed 12. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Orange, Massachusetts]] to Charles H. and Grace Newton Anthony in 1916, Anthony skipped a grade in elementary school and attended high school in [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]]. There he played the saxophone in the school band, and graduated in 1933 at the age of 16.&lt;ref name="TAHoF"/&gt; In 1938 Anthony graduated from [[Colby College]], and in 1942 received his master's degree in business administration from Harvard, and in 1952 his Doctor of Commercial Science degree.

Anthony was a Harvard Business School faculty member from 1940 to 1982. In 1942 he became research assistant to [[Ross G. Walker]] (1891-1970), Harvard Professor of Business Administration since 1936. After his service in the US Navy from 1943 to 1946 he returned to Harvard, where he was appointed Full professor in 1956. In 1965 he took another leave of absence from Harvard to serve as the [[Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)|Under Secretary of Defense]] under his friend, Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]].&lt;ref name="NYT 2006"&gt;Dennis Hevesi, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/18/business/18anthonyobit.html?_r=0 Robert N. Anthony Dies at 90; Made Accounting Easier to Learn]," in ''New York Times,'' Dec. 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 and 1974, he was president of the [[American Accounting Association]].&lt;ref name="HG 2006"&gt;"[http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/12.14/15-anthonyobit.html HBS professor, member of Accounting Hall of Fame Robert Anthony dies]" in ''Gazette,'' Harvard University, Dec. 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
=== Planning and management control ===
Harvard Business School professor [[Regina Herzlinger]] explained about the impact of Anthony's work in the 2006 obituary in the [[Harvard Gazette]]: 
:''Bob Anthony took a field that was something that only accountants did and transformed it into one that informed top managers in the planning and control of their organizations... He had a monumental impact not only on his students, through his teaching and textbooks, but also on the business, nonprofit, and government worlds through his many influential articles and powerful personal demeanor - his knowledge, intellectual clarity, sense of duty and honor, and managerial perspective.''&lt;ref name="HG 2006"/&gt;
And furthermore:
:''Bob was also a marvelous writer. He made the murky subject of accounting clear. These exceptional qualities of mind and character, coupled with a Yankee work ethic, helped him to transform the field of managerial accounting from the province of accountants to the tool of managers.''&lt;ref name="HG 2006"/&gt;
And Harvard accounting professor [[Charles Christenson]] added: 
:''Bob did more than anyone else to introduce a conceptual structure to management control. In his numerous publications, he has ranged across all the important questions. 'Management Control in Industry Research Organizations,' for example, examined the problem of measuring intellectual output - a much more difficult task than measuring more tangible output. His 1965 book, 'Planning and Control Systems,' became the bible of the field.&lt;ref name="HG 2006"/&gt;

=== Comptroller at the US Department of Defense ===
In 1965 Anthony served as [[comptroller]] at the [[US Department of Defense]] under Robert S. McNamara, where he supervised the quality of accounting and financial reporting of the organization. Antony was credited for aligning the accounting service among the five military services. [[Charles Christenson]] explained: 
:''He changed the way the Defense Department operated... There was a substantial cost overrun on the [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman missile program]]. Secretary McNamara wanted procedures to keep that from happening again. Bob made sure all the branches were on the same wavelength.''&lt;ref name="NYT 2006"/&gt;

A '''secured creditor''' is a [[creditor]] with the benefit of a [[security interest]] over some or all of the assets of the [[debtor]].

In the event of the [[bankruptcy]] of the debtor, the secured creditor can enforce security against the assets of the debtor and avoid competing for a distribution on liquidation with the [[unsecured creditor]]s.

In most legal systems, secured creditors also have the option of releasing their security and proving in the [[liquidation]], although, in practice, they would rarely do so.

'''Sylvia Park''' is a large [[business park]] and [[shopping mall|shopping centre]] in the [[Auckland]] suburb of [[Mount Wellington, New Zealand|Mount Wellington]] in New Zealand. Less commonly known, the area around the centre (which includes some residential and other commercial developments) is also called Sylvia Park (the centre takes its name from the area, not vice versa, but Sylvia Park is not officially a suburb). The area is located adjacent to two major interchanges of the [[Auckland Southern Motorway]] – the South Eastern Highway (which passes directly above the shopping centre on a viaduct) and Mount Wellington Highway.

Land and store space in the Sylvia Park development is let out to a wide variety of major retailers, one cinema complex and two supermarkets. In addition, the centre has franchises of all major New Zealand banks and a wide variety of other retailers. The centre employs approximately 2,500 staff of which only four are security guards and was drawing about 12,000 shoppers at a time during the weekends of the 2007 winter months.&lt;ref name="HERJUN"/&gt;

In a rating of New Zealand shopping centres by a retail expert group in 2008, Sylvia Park received four stars, the maximum rating, based on the criteria of amount of shopping area, economic performance, amenity and appeal as well as future growth prospects. Especially praised were the wide catchment of shoppers and the motorway accessibility.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10520245"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10520245 |title=How your shopping mall rates against the rest |author=Gibson, Anne |date=7 July 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Original site ===
The name Sylvia Park is from the large country house/[[Stud (animal)|stud farm]] built there in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/Places/Auckland/AucklandPlaces/14/ENZ-Resources/Standard/4/en Sylvia Park shopping centre] (from [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]. Accessed 2008-06-07.)&lt;/ref&gt; It was the country residence of Sir [[Maurice O'Rorke]], one of the first Speakers of the House. Sir Maurice used the land primarily for horse breeding. The house was demolished in the 1960s. From 1943 until 1992, Sylvia Park was the site of an extensive Army supply stores complex built by the American Forces during WWII.  After the war these buildings were used by the NZ Defense Forces and a mix of industrial users. The buildings, which gradually became empty, were demolished for the shopping mall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/interactive/us-military-forces-new-zealand US military forces in New Zealand map], Ministry for Culture and Heritage, updated 14 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Carbine Road is named after the racehorse [[Carbine (horse)|Carbine]] who was foaled at Sylvia Park Stud.

=== Development ===
The development is owned by Sylvia Park Business Centre Ltd (SPBCL), a subsidiary of [[Kiwi Property Group]]. The development is situated on 24 hectares of land, a large part of which is still to be developed as of the late 2000s. Kiwi Property acquired the land in two transactions in 1995.

However, the land was at that stage [[zoning|zoned]] for [[Industry|industrial]] use by the [[Auckland City Council]]. The developers asked the council to modify the [[District Plan]] to allow high-density commercial use, a change which the council supported, and drafted into "Plan Change 4". However, the plan change was opposed by the [[Ngāti Maru (Hauraki)|Ngati Maru]] [[Iwi]] authority, which represents [[Māori people|Māori]] interests in the area. A December 2001 decision of the [[Environment Court of New Zealand]] confirmed the plan change. Demolition and construction began in 2004, with retail construction beginning in 2005.

==== Opening issues ====
Stage One of the development opened to the public on 6 June 2006. The opening received nationwide television and radio coverage the day before, as the development is one of the largest in New Zealand. This resulted in a very high shopper turnout on the opening day, and despite planning by SPBCL, caused severe [[gridlock]] on the notoriously busy [[Auckland Southern Motorway]] as well as major arterial routes in the vicinity of the centre, including the South-Eastern and Mount Wellington Highways. [[Transit New Zealand]] and SPBCL took the unusual step of recommending people postpone trips to the mall.&lt;ref name="stayaway"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10386165 |title=Stay away, mall tells shoppers |author=Binning, Elizabeth |date=12 June 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the conditions of being granted planning permission SPBCL was required to manage traffic flows to the site, and had the traffic jams continued would have faced an accelerated timetable for upgrading key roads. The congestion did force SPBCL to implement a traffic monitoring programme ahead of schedule.&lt;ref name="jams"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10387012 |title=Sylvia Park may face bill for jams |author=Bernard Orsman and Anne Gibson |date=17 June 2006 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stage Two of the development opened in August 2006 and expanded the fashion, beauty and food retailers of the centre.

In contrast to the initial interest, weekday retail sales were soon considered to be flagging, with the centre being nicknamed 'Spooky Park' by some. The owners noted that this did not extend to weekend sales, and that the centre had in the meantime gained during the weekdays as well.&lt;ref name="HERJUN"/&gt;

The centre is today one of New Zealand's busiest malls, attracting over 12 million customers per year. Kiwi Property is currently investigating plans to undertake a $150 million expansion of the centre.

==== Expansion ====
Stage Three was opened 29 March 2007, and included a cinema (along with the biggest 35&amp;nbsp;mm permanent movie screen in the world, according to the [[Guinness World Records]]),&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10431363"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10431363 |title=Auckland multiplex screen a Guinness World Record |date=28 March 2007 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borders bookstore, 45 new stores, bars and restaurants,&lt;ref name="Hoyts"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10423473 |title=Hoyts thinks big in battle to attract moviegoers |author=Drinnan, John |date=12 February 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 26 stores which were either new to New Zealand or did not yet have stores in shopping centres.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10431435"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10431435 |title=45 new stores add cinema, food and fun to mega mall |author=Trevett, Claire |date=29 March 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage Four opened in June 2007, and finished the retail area of the centre, which now has 200 shops covering 6.5 ha of indoors space and is valued at NZ$450 million.&lt;ref name="HERJUN"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/business/news/article.cfm?c_id=3&amp;objectid=10448353 |title=$200m Sylvia Park office plan |author=Gibson, Anne |date=28 June 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening of the relocated [[Sylvia Park railway station]] in July 2007, directly adjacent to the eastern side of the shopping centre, as required by the resource consent of the centre, links Sylvia Park to the [[List of Auckland railway stations|Auckland rail network]] via the [[Eastern Line, Auckland|Eastern Line]].&lt;ref name="SYLVRAIL"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/retailing/news/article.cfm?c_id=77&amp;objectid=10449017 |title=Next stop, shopping ... big centre gets its own rail station |author=Dearnaley, Mathew |date=2 July 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2017, trains arrive at Sylvia Park at least every 20 minutes on weekdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://at.govt.nz/media/1972686/t02_eastern-train_march-2017-web.pdf|accessdate=15 May 2017|title=eastern-train_march-2017|date=12 March 2017|publisher=Auckland Transport}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plans ==
The opening of Stage Five was planned for 2008 and to add NZ$200 million of office space in four separate buildings. Kiwi Income noted that it had always planned to develop offices around the perimeter of the centre, but had delayed this until the retail was starting to take off.&lt;ref name="HERJUN"/&gt; Kiwi Property have begun the $280 million expansion, which sees the construction of a nine floor office block and 20,000 square meters of addition retail space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/80039846/sylvia-park-expansion-plan-hinges-on-market |title=Sylvia Park $280 million expansion plan hinges on market |publisher=Stuff.co.nz |date=22 May 2016 |author=Catherine Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''White Collar Zen''' is a project by [[Steven Heine]], who is primarily known for his research on medieval Japanese [[Religion in Japan|religion]] and society. The project deals with the principles of [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] in relation to the contemporary workplace and professional leadership issues. ''White Collar Zen'' demonstrates how to incorporate [[Zen]] principles into daily work life in order to achieve professional success.

In addition to the book – ''White Collar Zen: Using Zen Principles to Overcome Obstacles and Achieve Your Goal'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2005) – White Collar Zen is a multi-faceted project that includes a unique course on Asian Cultural Values in Business sponsored by the Eugenio Pino Entrepreneurship Center at [[Florida International University]], as well as workshops and conferences on ancient Asian wisdom and modern business.

The Asian Cultural Values in Business course was first taught in fall 2006. On November 17, 2006 a conference was held titled ''From East to West and West to East''. It included four panels that discussed how Asia has influenced the way the West does business and vice versa, and included such topics as Asian investment and international issues, leadership in a global perspective, and Asian cultural values and entrepreneurship. The panels featured student presentations from the Asian Cultural Values in Business course and various other speakers. Among them were authors of business negotiations in Asia: Mark McNeilly (Sun Tzu and the Art of Business: Six Strategic Principles for Managers), Bill Diffenderffer (The Samurai Leader), and Kaihan Krippendorff (The Art of Advantage: 36 Strategies to Seize the Competitive Edge).

==How to Tell a Buddha from a Fox==
In Asia, the mythical [[Kitsune|Fox]] is the primary symbol of how one can become entangled in a web of misunderstanding. The [[Kitsune|Fox]], which appears to its unwitting victim in human form, represents the deception and duplicity that brings with it self-doubt and frustrates the pursuit of aspirations. It is a symbol of undesirable tendencies, such as chasing after unattainable aims while leaving important parts of life unattended. Along with [[Kitsune|Foxes]] who deceive, however, there are always the [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]] who are eager to support, not because of personal ties or loyalty, but because they objectively evaluate the merits and demerits of a situation. Both the [[Kitsune|Fox]] and the Buddha are often disguised and each tries to pass as the other for strategic purposes. Distinguishing between them is a valuable skill. As decisions hang in the balance, the Unmoving Mind is a tool to separate truth or authenticity from illusion or untruth. Illusion renders you vulnerable to anxiety and confusion and unable to react to critical situations with clarity and lucidity.

==Elevation–Purification–Activation==
The process of Elevation-Purification-Activation (EPA) cultivates four basic levels of human consciousness: feeling or emotion, speaking or communication, thinking or logic, and knowing or intuitive awareness. When one is controlled by emotions, his or her actions become hasty and s/he is likely to say something inappropriate. The key is to elevate and purify one's feelings so that they are balanced and objective. 

In attaining the Hermit's objective, one can effectively bring about constructive change. Tamed emotions are transmuted into the foundation of productive understanding. Such an understanding enables one to act with the Warrior's effortless, spontaneous creativity.

==The Hermit and the Warrior==
[[Steven Heine|Heine]] describes how [[Zen]] embraces two different and seemingly contradictory yet harmonious paths of behavior. The Way of the Hermit teaches detachment – the mental clarity you need to view your situation dispassionately and impartially, to perceive who is a friend and who is an enemy, to understand what is possible and what is not. The Way of the Warrior teaches the ability to act without hesitation and at the appropriate moment. Together, the ways can prepare one to meet the challenges of the modern world of business.  

Both ways can be applied to contemporary affairs.  The Warrior is always on the move and is able to establish a base of power while transient. The shifts and transitions do not conflict, but in the end enhance the Warrior's abilities. The Hermit is also in a state of continuing transition. A hermit gains strength through passivity, standing back from conflict, looking at things clearly and objectively, and remaining noncommittal until it is absolutely necessary to react. He aggressively pursues passivity by moving, not standing still and seeking out areas and arenas where constructive passivity can best be applied. 

The Warrior is dynamic, assertive and taking a stand. A Hermit is also dynamic in his own way by actively not taking a stand. In integrating the Warrior and Hermit approaches, Zen training provides a timely new paradigm for being clear in thoughts and disciplined in actions to establish harmonious interpersonal relations and attain mutually beneficial goals.

==Encounter vs. Confrontation==
A key objective is to transform dysfunctional conflicts (or Confrontations) rife with antagonism and turmoil into creative negotiations (or Encounters) characterized by shared purposes and cooperation. In a Confrontation, words do not ease tensions or have a reforming impact but cause the basic inflexibility of structure to tighten. It is characterized by personal will and gain, divisiveness, threats, and demands.  It results in a direct challenge based on alternating aggressive and passive attitudes which lead to conflict and discord. 

A Confrontation compounds futility and leads to further misunderstanding, whereas an Encounter is a productive form of negotiation with mutually beneficial results. Through negotiations, agreements, and ongoing teamwork, one can use indirect methods to reach goals by creating situations that facilitate cooperation. Both approaches involve some kind of meeting but the former, by being one-dimensional in attitude, fails to mobilize multiple factors of constructive engagement.

==The Four Steps==
The Four Steps are a means of developing self-discipline and self-control to overcome obstacles at the workplace and achieve success in the professional world through an Encounter. By cultivating the Unmoving Mind and by applying the methods discussed in ''White Collar Zen'', one is able to deal with professional challenges:

===Step 1: Recognize a Crisis in Structure===
Recognize a crisis in the structure of the work organizational environment and work through channels by investigating the roots of the problem, but without jumping to conclusions in either blaming others or remaining unassertive.

===Step 2: Use Words Creatively===
Speak creatively to alter perceptions and receptivity regarding a problem in organizational structure by getting one's message across effectively. One persuades not because of self-interest, but based on genuine commitment to ideals and goals.

===Step 3: Silence as a Tool for Strategic Planning===
Move beyond reliance on words by knowing when to refrain from speaking if verbal communication falls short, and let events take a natural course through waiting patiently yet without becoming overly passive.

===Step 4: Enter the Realm of Anti-Structure===
When both words and no-words fail, a more inventive form of ''White Collar Zen'' is required, which is found in the fourth step, the path of anti-structure. Awakening the Unmoving Mind empowers you to cross over invisible lines of hierarchy and division. Seize the moment for a bold, break the rules anti-structural expression that is based on integrity and responsibility. Cutting through structure involves taking risks but can be appropriate and conducive to progressive interaction and growth.  There are times when the attitudes or behavior of Zen masters are unpredictable and even outrageous in questioning authority that is arbitrary and therefore oppressive.  A famous saying is, "If you see the Buddha on the road, kill the Buddha."  This approach relinquishes any attachment to security and safety and takes a Zen master's leap from a 100-foot pole.
