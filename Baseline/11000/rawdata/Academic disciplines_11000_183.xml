{{Anthropology}}
'''[[Anthropology of development|Anthropology]] of media''' (also '''anthropology of mass media''', '''media anthropology''') is an area of study within [[social anthropology|social]] or [[cultural anthropology]] that emphasizes [[ethnography|ethnographic studies]] as a means of understanding producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of [[mass media]].

==Methodology==
The use of [[qualitative research|qualitative]] methods, particularly [[ethnography]], distinguishes media anthropology from other disciplinary approaches to mass media.&lt;ref&gt;Faye Ginsburg, Lila Abu-Lughod &amp; Brian Larkin. (2002) ''Media Worlds: Anthropology of New Terrain''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within [[media studies]], media ethnographies have been of increasing interest since the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;David Morley. (1980) ''The “Nationwide” Audience: Structure and Decoding''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ien Ang. (1991) ''Desperately Seeking the Audience''&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Stephen Putnam Hughes remarks in a recent review, these studies often do not engage in rigorous ethnographic fieldwork, ignoring or misapplying such landmark anthropological techniques as [[participant observation]] or long-term fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Putnam Hughes. (2011). 'Anthropology and the Problem of Audience Reception', in Marcus Banks &amp; Jay Ruby. ''Made to be Seen: Perspectives on the History of Visual Anthropology''&lt;/ref&gt; Given such differences, anthropologists who take an interest in the media see themselves as forming a distinct subfield from ethnographic approaches to [[media studies]] and [[cultural studies]].

==Theory==
The anthropology of media is a fairly inter-disciplinary area, with a wide range of other influences. The theories used in the anthropology of media range from practice approaches, associated with theorists such as [[Pierre Bourdieu]], as well as discussions of the appropriation and adaptation of new technologies and practices.  Theoretical approaches have also been adopted from [[visual anthropology]] and from [[film theory]], as well as from studies of ritual and performance studies (e.g. dance and theatre), studies of [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], audience reception in media studies, [[new media]] and network theories, theories of [[globalisation]], theories of international [[civil society]], and discussions on participatory communications and [[governance]] in [[development studies]].

==Ethnographic contexts==
The types of ethnographic contexts explored in the anthropology of media range from contexts of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers, [[journalists]] in the field, film production) to contexts of media reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media such as newspaper cartoons (Khanduri 2014).  Other types include [[cyber anthropology]], a relatively new area of [[internet research]], as well as ethnographies of other areas of research which happen to involve media, such as development work, [[social movements]], human rights &lt;ref&gt;Wortham, Erica (2013) Indigenous Media in Mexico: Culture, Community and the State (Duke University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;or health education. This is in addition to many classic ethnographic contexts, where media such as [[radio]], [[newspaper|the press]], [[new media]] and [[television]](Mankekar 1999, Abu-Lughod 2005) have started to make their presences felt since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Spitulnik. (1993) 'Anthropology and Mass Media', ''Annual Review of Anthropology'', 22: 293-315&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lila Abu-Lughod. (1997) 'The Interpretation of Cultures after Television', ''Representations'', 59: 109-133&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ashkenazum''' was an [[organized crime]] group active in [[Argentina]] in the first half of the 20th century. Ashkenazum was founded by [[Simon Rubinstein (pimp)|Simon Rubinstein]] as a splinter group from the larger [[Zwi Migdal]], an organized crime group that stretched across five continents and specialized in the sex trafficking of [[Eastern European]] [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] girls.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, Edward J. Prostitution and Prejudice: the Jewish Fight against White Slavery, 1870-1939. Schocken Books, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon Rubinstein arrived in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1900 from [[Odessa]], and there he quickly acquired control of a condom factory. He was a notorious silk smuggler, and became affiliated with the Zwi Migdal. At the height of his operation, he had 700 agents in Argentina trafficking women for him.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Hilary. Harlots, Whores &amp; Hookers: a History of Prostitution. Dorset Press, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the larger Zwi Migdal, the Ashkenazum also had its own cemetery outside of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3403899,00.html Kupferboim, Rona. “Argentine Jewry's Dark Secret.” Ynet News, Jewish World, 25 May 2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Association for the Support of Contemporary Living''' ({{lang-tr|Çağdaş Yaşamı Destekleme Derneği}}) is a non-profit NGO in [[Turkey]]. The main office is in [[İstanbul]] and there are 103 branch offices nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cydd.org.tr/eng/default.asp Branch office list] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230000000/http://www.cydd.org.tr/eng/default.asp |date=December 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The association helps girls across Turkey obtain an education, ultimately promoting gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women of Istanbul|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melis-figanmese/women-of-istanbul_b_3081257.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
Association for the Support of Contemporary Living (abbreviated ÇYDD) was founded on 10 February 1989 by a group of Turkish female academicians headed by [[Aysel Ekşi]] and [[Türkan Saylan]] in İstanbul.&lt;ref name="Tarih"&gt;[http://www.genclik.cydd.org.tr/index.php/kurumsal/77-cydd-tarihi.html Chronology from the ÇYDD youth page {{tr icon}})] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001114/http://www.genclik.cydd.org.tr/index.php/kurumsal/77-cydd-tarihi.html |date=December 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Next year Türkan Saylan was elected as the chairperson of the ÇYDD; from then on she became the symbol of ÇYDD. In the same year branch offices of ÇYDD began to be opened in other cities. In 1995 a subsidiary foundation of ÇYDD was founded. On 18 May 2009 Türkan Saylan died and in the next week, [[Aysel Çelikel]] a [[57th government of Turkey|former government]] minister became the next chairperson.&lt;ref name="Tarih"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5243">'''BC Agriculture in the Classroom Foundation''' (BCAITC) is a registered [[nonprofit organization]] that works with educators through various programs to bring [[British Columbia|British Columbia's]] agriculture to elementary and secondary students within the province. Students learn about where their food comes from, how to grow their own food, and why farms and agriculture play such an important role in our society.

== Governance ==
The foundation is part of a national group, [http://www.aitc.ca/ Agriculture in the Classroom] that operates across [[Canada]] through individual provinces. Though partially supported by government, the foundation relies on financial support from the agricultural community to sustain its activities.

The organization's mission is: "Working to bring BC's agriculture to our students".

The foundation has representation on its board of directors from [[teachers]], the provincial government, [[financial institutions]], [[nutritionists]], producers, and [[dieticians]].

==Teacher Resources and Programs==

BCAITC's resource centre provides teachers with print and video resources.&lt;ref&gt;BCAITC Resources http://www.aitc.ca/bc/index.php?page=resources&lt;/ref&gt; With titles such as The Sustainability Road Show, Wonderful Worms, Food For Thought,&lt;ref&gt;Metro Vancouver http://www.metrovancouver.org/region/teachers/Pages/AgricultureFood4Thought.aspx {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227083651/http://www.metrovancouver.org/region/teachers/Pages/AgricultureFood4Thought.aspx |date=2011-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spuds In Tubs, teachers from all grades are encouraged to bring resources into their classroom and have developed different programs to help spread awareness of agriculture and the importance of eating healthy and supporting local producers.&lt;ref&gt;BCAITC Programs http://www.aitc.ca/bc/index.php?page=programs&lt;/ref&gt;

===Take a Bite of BC===

Take a Bite of BC was developed in 2009 by BCAITC in partnership with the BC Culinary Arts Association, BC agricultural commodity groups and BC producers. BC grown products are donated to the program and delivered to participating secondary school teaching kitchens over a four-month period. The program provides an opportunity for Chef Instructors to feature locally grown product in secondary school teaching kitchens.&lt;ref&gt;Vancouver Sun https://vancouversun.com/business/Students+serve+tasty+Bite/4463235/story.html&lt;/ref&gt; Students gain experience working with fresh products and begin to develop an appreciation for [[farmers]] in their community as they connect with the foods that are grown around them and learn about the benefits of eating healthy, fresh and local. As of the 2016/2017 school year, all 60 secondary schools with culinary arts programs are benefiting from this program.  {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

===Spuds in Tubs===

BCAITC's signature program, Spuds in Tubs enables students to experience growing their own food. With the help of a teacher, students plant seed potatoes into tubs, and from there tend them and watch them grow into something they can harvest and eat. There are currently 125 classrooms and 3,250 students participating {{citation needed|date=February 2015}}.

===The BC School Fruit and Vegetable Nutritional Program===

The foundation's biggest program, the BC School Fruit and Vegetable Nutritional Program, partners with local producers to deliver fresh, local fruits and [[vegetables]] to BC schools. In 2011 a three million dollar expansion of the program was announced and the program will now reach over 1,200 schools in BC, and serve over 400,000 students with fresh fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;BC Government http://www2.news.gov.bc.ca/news_releases_2009-2013/2011PREM0051-000552.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summer Institute==

The Summer Institute is a course put on by BCAITC for teachers who want to learn more about [[agriculture]]. This course is designed for teachers in the BC school system to explore practical ways to integrate concepts related to [[food production]] and consumption, [[food safety]], agricultural issues, and [[sustainability]] across the curriculum at all grade levels.  Through active participation, field trips, guest speakers, video presentations, and the like, participants will expand their knowledge of agriculture and food concepts and issues and reflect on their own values and orientations to the topic.  Ways to incorporate this new knowledge into existing courses will be explored with ethical defensibility being the guiding principle.  The goal is to produce curriculum projects that can be implemented in schools or other settings. The course is put on in partnership with the [[University of British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;UBC http://www.eplt.educ.ubc.ca/courses/home-economics-education-summer-institutes-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ball and beam''' system consists of a long beam which can be tilted by a servo or electric motor together with a ball
rolling back and forth on top of the beam.
It is a popular textbook example in [[control theory]].

The significance of the ball and beam system is that it is a simple system which is open-loop [[BIBO stability|unstable]].
Even if the beam is restricted to be very nearly horizontal, without active [[feedback]], it will swing to one side or the
other, and the ball will roll off the end of the beam.  To stabilize the ball, a [[controller (control theory)|control system]] which
measures the position of the ball and adjusts the beam accordingly must be used.

In two dimensions, the ball and beam system becomes the '''ball and plate''' system, where a ball rolls on top of
a plate whose inclination can be adjusted by tilting it frontwards, backwards, leftwards, or rightwards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16750">[[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]]  System '''B''' was the [[625-line]] analog broadcast [[television]] system which at its peak was the system used in most countries. It is being replaced across Western Europe, part of Asia and Africa by [[DVB-T|digital broadcasting]].

== Specifications ==

The system was developed for [[VHF]] band (part of RF band lower than 300&amp;nbsp;MHz.) Some of the most important specs are listed below.&lt;ref&gt;Reference Data for Radio Engineers, ITT Howard W.Sams Co., New York, 1977, section 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Channel spacing for CCIR television System B (VHF Bands).jpg|frame|Channel spacing for CCIR television System B (VHF Bands)&lt;br&gt;The separation between the aural and visual carriers is 5.5 MHz.]]
A frame is the total picture. The '''frame rate''' is the number of pictures displayed in one second. But each frame is actually scanned twice '''interleaving''' odd and even lines. Each scan is known as a field (odd and even fields.) So '''field rate''' is twice the frame rate. In each frame there are 625 '''lines''' (or 312.5 lines in a field.) So '''line rate''' (line frequency) is 625 times the frame frequency or 625•25=15625&amp;nbsp;Hz.

The '''video bandwidth''' is 5.0&amp;nbsp;MHz. The video signal modulates the carrier by [[Amplitude Modulation]]. But a portion of the lower side band is suppressed. This technique is known as vestigial side band modulation ('''AC3'''). The polarity of modulation is negative, meaning that an increase in the instantaneous brightness of the [[video signal]] results in a decrease in RF power and vice versa. Specifically, the sync pulses (being "blacker than black") result in maximum power from the transmitter.

The primary [[audio signal]] is modulated by [[Frequency modulation]] with a [[preemphasis]] '''time constant''' of τ = 50 μs. The '''deviation''' for a 1.0&amp;nbsp;kHz. AF signal is 50&amp;nbsp;kHz.

The separation between the primary audio FM subcarrier and the video carrier is 5.5&amp;nbsp;MHz.

The total '''RF bandwidth''' of System B (as originally designed with its single FM audio subcarrier) was 6.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, allowing System B to be transmitted in the 7.0&amp;nbsp;MHz wide channels specified for television in the VHF bands with an ample 500&amp;nbsp;kHz guard zone between channels.&lt;ref&gt;Nedim Ardoğa:TV Verici tekniğine giriş p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

In specs, sometimes, other parameters such as vestigial sideband characteristics and gamma of display device are also given.

=== Colour TV ===
System '''B''' has variously been used with both the [[PAL]] or [[SECAM]] colour systems. It could have been used with a 625-line variant of the [[NTSC]] color system, but apart from possible technical tests in the 1950s, this has never been done officially.

When used with PAL, the colour subcarrier is 4.43361875&amp;nbsp;MHz and the sidebands of the PAL signal have to be truncated on the high-frequency side at +570&amp;nbsp;kHz (matching the rolloff of the luminance signal at +5.0&amp;nbsp;MHz). On the low-frequency side, the full 1.3&amp;nbsp;MHz sideband is radiated. ( This behaviour would cause massive U/V crosstalk in the NTSC system, but delay-line PAL hides such artefacts. )

When used with SECAM, the 'R' lines' carrier is at 4.40625&amp;nbsp;MHz deviating from +350±18&amp;nbsp;kHz to -506±25&amp;nbsp;kHz. The 'B' lines' carrier is at 4.250&amp;nbsp;MHz deviating +506±25&amp;nbsp;kHz to -350±18&amp;nbsp;kHz.

Neither colour encoding system has any effect on the bandwidth of system '''B''' as a whole.

=== Improved audio===
Enhancements have been made to the specification of System B's audio capabilities over the years. The introduction of [[Zweiton]] in the 1970s allowed for stereo sound or twin monophonic audio tracks (possibly in different languages for instance). This was implemented by adding a second FM audio subcarrier at +5.74&amp;nbsp;MHz. Alternatively, starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s it became possible to replace the second audio FM subcarrier with a digital signal carrying [[NICAM]] sound. Either of these extensions to audio capability have eaten into the guard band between channels. Zweiton uses an extra 150&amp;nbsp;kHz. The alternative NICAM system uses an extra 500&amp;nbsp;kHz, and needs to be spaced further from the primary audio subcarrier, thus System B with NICAM has only 150&amp;nbsp;kHz guard zones between channels.

== Transmission channels ==
System '''B''' was the first internationally accepted [[625-line]] broadcasting standard in the world.{{Citation needed|reason=Need name and date of a corresponding international document, better with a link. Also, need dates for other standards to prove this one was accepted eariler.|date=July 2017}} The European 41-68&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Band I]] television allocation was agreed at the 1947 ITU (International Telecommunications Union) conference in 1947, and the first European channel plan (i.e. the use of channels E2&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;E4) was agreed in 1952 at the ITU conference in Stockholm. The extension to VHF [[Band III]] (i.e. Channels E5&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;E12) was also agreed in the 1950s.

Since then, the System B specification has been used with slightly different broadcast frequencies in many other countries.

Transmitters were operational on the above channels in 1959. During the 1960s, channels 1 to 3 were deleted and channels E3 to E12 adopted, bringing East Germany into line with the channel allocations used in the West.

=== Italy ===
Italian channel-spacings were erratic. System B is no longer in use in Italy, the switchover to DVB-T having been completed 4 July 2012.

Note: Unusually for Europe, Band III is used for DVB-T in Italy. At digital switchover time, Italy took the opportunity to discontinue their erratic System B frequencies, and the digital channels (known as Ch5 through Ch12) are regularly-spaced every 7.0&amp;nbsp;MHz from 177.5&amp;nbsp;MHz (and identical to Germany's Band III DVB-T bandplan).

===Australia VHF (until 1993)===
Australia were unique in the world by their use of [[Band II]] for television broadcasting.

‡ Channels 3, 4 and 5 were scheduled to be cleared during 1993-96 to make way for FM radio stations in Band II. This clearance action took much longer than was anticipated, and as a result, many stations on channel 3 still remain, along with a few on 4 and 5.

== System G and H ==
When the UHF bands came into use in the early 1960s, two variants of System '''B''' began to be used on those frequencies.

In most countries, the channels on the UHF bands are 8&amp;nbsp;MHz wide, but in most system '''B''' countries transmissions on the UHF channels still use system '''B''' specifications, the only difference being that the guard band between the channels is 1.0&amp;nbsp;MHz wider than for System B. That system for the UHF bands is known as [[CCIR System G|System G]] and all RF specifications given above (apart from the guard band width) also apply to system '''G'''. Exceptions to this would seem to be Australia, Brunei and Tanzania where the UHF channels are 7&amp;nbsp;MHz wide, and system '''B''' is used on UHF just as it is on VHF.

A few countries (Belgium, several of the Balkan states and Malta) use another variant of system '''B''' on UHF which is known as [[CCIR System H|System H]]. System '''H''' is similar to system '''G''' but the lower (vestigial) side band is 500&amp;nbsp;kHz wider. This makes much better use of the 8.0&amp;nbsp;MHz channels of the UHF bands (though whether any system B/H televisions actually made use of the extra bandwidth is not known).

'''CPM-GOMS''' is a variation of the [[GOMS]] technique in [[human computer interaction]].  CPM-GOMS stands for two things:  ''Cognitive Perceptual Motor'' and the project planning technique ''[[Critical Path Method]]'' (from which it borrows some elements).

==Overview==

CPM-GOMS was developed in 1988 by [[Bonnie E. John|Bonnie John]],&lt;ref name="CHI92"&gt;{{cite conference|first=Wayne D.|last=Gray |author2=John, Bonnie E. |author3=Atwood, Michael E.| title=The Precis of Project Ernestine or an overview of a validation of GOMS|booktitle=Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems|year=1992|doi=10.1145/142750.142821|isbn=0897915135}}&lt;/ref&gt; a former student of [[Allen Newell]].  Unlike the other GOMS variations, CPM-GOMS does not assume that the user's interaction is a serial process, and hence can model multitasking behavior that can be exhibited by experienced users.  The technique is also based directly on the [[model human processor]] - a simplified model of human responses.

Evaluators begin a CPM-GOMS analysis in the same way they would a [[CMN-GOMS]] analysis.  However, when the tasks are broken down just to the level where they are still perceptual or motor, the evaluator applies techniques from the model human processor.  The tasks are first joined together serially and then examined to see which actions can be overlapped so that they happen in parallel.  This technique facilitates representation of overlapping and very efficient "chunks" of activity characteristic of expert users.  The estimated times by CPM-GOMS are generally faster since they do not allocate as much time to the "prepare for action"  type operations.

This is the most difficult GOMS technique to implement.  Therefore, it has the problem of discrepancies between evaluators.  Research is currently being conducted to improve the CPM-GOMS technique so that it can be used without the evaluator having a high level understanding of the GOMS theoretical foundations.

==Software==

'''Cardiophysics''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] [[science]] that stands at the junction of [[cardiology]] and [[medical physics]], with researchers using the methods of, and theories from, [[physics]] to study [[Cardiovascular|cardiovascular system]] at different levels of its organisation, from the molecular scale to whole organisms. Being formed historically as part of [[systems biology]], ''cardiophysics'' designed to reveal connections between the physical mechanisms, underlying the organization of the cardiovascular system, and biological features of its functioning.

Zbigniew R. Struzik seems to be a first author who used the term in a scientific publication in 2004.

One can use interchangeably also the terms ''cardiovascular physics''.

'''Clinical vampirism''', more commonly known as '''Renfield's syndrome''' or '''Renfield syndrome''', is an obsession with drinking [[blood]]. The earliest formal presentation of clinical vampirism to appear in the psychiatric literature, with the psychoanalytic interpretation of two cases, was contributed by Richard L. Vanden Bergh and John F. Kelley in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vanden Bergh|first=Richard L.|author2=Kelley, John F.|title=Vampirism -- A review with new observations|journal=Archives of General Psychiatry|year=1964|volume=11|pages=543–547|doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1964.01720290085012|pmid=14208658}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the authors point out, brief and sporadic reports of blood-drinking behaviors associated with sexual pleasure have appeared in the psychiatric literature at least since 1892 with the work of Austrian forensic psychiatrist [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]. Many medical publications concerning clinical vampirism can be found in the literature of forensic psychiatry, with the unusual behavior reported as one of many aspects of extraordinary violent crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hemphill|first=R.E.|author2=Zabow, T.|title=Clinical vampirism: A presentation of 3 cases and a reevaluation of Haigh, the "Acid-Bath Murderer"|journal=South African Medical Journal|year=1983|volume=63|pages=278–281.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jaffe|first=PD|author2=DiCataldo, F.|title=Clinical vampirism: blending myth and reality|journal=Bulletin of the American Academy of Psychiatry and Law|year=1994|volume=22|issue=4|pages=533–544}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramsland|first=Katharine|title=The Vampire Killers|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/vampires/1.html|publisher=Crime Library|accessdate=3 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210092523/http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/weird/vampires/1.html|archive-date=10 December 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The syndrome is named after [[Dracula]]'s human zoophagous follower, [[Renfield|R. M. Renfield]], in the 1897 novel by [[Bram Stoker]]. According to an interview conducted by psychology professor [[Katherine Ramsland]] with clinical psychologist [[Richard Noll]], who coined the eponymous term in a 1992 book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Richard Noll]] | title=Vampires, Werewolves and Demons: twentieth century reports in the psychiatric literature | publisher=Brunner/Mazel Publications | year=1992 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVkfHgAACAAJ&amp;dq |isbn=0-87630-632-6}},https://www.academia.edu/6793535/Vampires_Werewolves_and_Demons_Twentieth_Century_Case_Reports_in_the_Psychiatric_Literature_1991_&lt;/ref&gt; he invented the term and its purported diagnostic criteria as a whimsical parody of the "new DSM-speak" of the psychiatry of the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramsland|first=Katharine|title=Vampire Personality Disorder|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/shadow-boxing/201211/vampire-personality-disorder|publisher=Psychology Today (21 November 2012)|accessdate=2 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a public lecture hosted by Penn State University's Institute for the Arts and Humanities on 7 October 2013, Noll traced the 20-year trajectory of his unintentionally created "monster" from the moment of its creation as a parody of DSM mental disorders to the cultural popularity of Renfield's syndrome today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Penn State University Institute for the Arts and Humanities|title=Events Schedule, October 2013|url=http://www.iah.psu.edu/archive/allevents.shtml|accessdate=10 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914194410/http://iah.psu.edu/archive/allevents.shtml|archive-date=14 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268278489_Renfield's_Syndrome_or_How_I_(Unintentionally)_Created_a_Monster?ev=prf_pub|title=Renfield's Syndrome, or, How I (Unintentionally) Created a Monster|website=ResearchGate|date=October 2013|author=Richard Noll|access-date=2017-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032407/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268278489_Renfield's_Syndrome_or_How_I_(Unintentionally)_Created_a_Monster?ev=prf_pub|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Noll's book appeared in the year 1992 clinical vampirism has usually been referred to as Renfield's syndrome. In an NBC pre-Halloween special hosted by actor Peter Graves entitled "The Unexplained: Witches, Werewolves and Vampires" that aired on 23 October 1994 (and is available on YouTube, with the 34:11 mark beginning the segment), pages from Noll's book were shown on camera as Canadian psychologist [[Leonard George]] summarized Renfield's syndrome for a wide television audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unexplained: Witches, Werewolves and Demons|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sQN7VpdX4s|publisher=You Tube|accessdate=2 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609000940/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sQN7VpdX4s|archive-date=9 June 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Elias|first=Thomas D.|title=Television: "The Unexplained" Just the Latest Chapter in Peter Graves' Career|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-22/entertainment/9410220048_1_show-business-strange-stories-fun|publisher=Chicago Tribune, 22 October 1994|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=22 October 1994|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610205331/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-10-22/entertainment/9410220048_1_show-business-strange-stories-fun|archive-date=10 June 2015|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Characters suffering from Renfield's Syndrome have appeared on television. The first appeared in a 2005 episode of ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' titled "Committed" (Season 5, Episode 21).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CSI:Committed |url=http://www.cbs.com/primetime/csi/episodes/520 |quote=Kenny Valdez is in the Seclusion Room, strapped to a bed in a five-point restraint system, claiming he can "smell it!"

In 2010 an 11-episode Canadian television series, ''The Renfield Syndrome'', was filmed in Vancouver, B.C., but does not seem to have been aired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Renfield Syndrome (2010)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764036/|accessdate=1 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406092302/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1764036/|archive-date=6 April 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 August 2012 Renfield's syndrome was the subject of a video segment on ''The Huffington Post'' by Cara Santa Maria which again relied heavily on Noll's work and a recent scholarly article on the (pseudo-)syndrome published in the ''Journal of the History of the Neurosciences''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santa Maria|first=Cara|authorlink=Cara Santa Maria|title=Renfield's Syndrome: A Mysterious Case of Real-Life Vampirism|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/renfields-syndrome-vampirism_n_1765799.html|publisher=The Huffington Post (15 August 2012)|accessdate=2 March 2013|date=15 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325171428/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/15/renfields-syndrome-vampirism_n_1765799.html|archive-date=25 March 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olry|first=Regis|author2=Duane E.

In addition to references to Renfield's syndrome in the psychiatric literature and mass media, the horror writer Chelsea Quinn Yarbro published a story entitled "Renfield's Syndrome" in July 2002, which was then reprinted in an anthology that appeared the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yarbro|first=chelsea Quinn|title=Apprehensions and Other Delusions|year=2003|publisher=Five Star|location=Waterville, Maine}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the title of a novel by J.A.

The twenty-year evolution of a farcical 3-page book section that shot through the mass media and then—uncritically—into the pages of a peer-reviewed scholarly journal should serve as a cautionary tale about the purported validity of other "mental disorders." Philosopher of science Ian Hacking refers to this process as "making up people" and critiques medical and psychiatric elites for the untoward effects of their "dynamic nominalism" on individual lives. Such arbitrary categories create new natural "kinds" of people (e.g., perverts, multiple personalities and so on) that serve larger political, cultural and moral purposes and change with historical contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hacking|first=Ian|title=Making Up People|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n16/ian-hacking/making-up-people|publisher=London Review of Books, 28 (16): 23-26, 17 August 2006|accessdate=3 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609150150/http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n16/ian-hacking/making-up-people|archive-date=9 June 2013|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hacking|first=Ian|title=Making Up People (full text)|url=http://generation-online.org/c/fcbiopolitics2.htm|accessdate=3 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306133122/http://www.generation-online.org/c/fcbiopolitics2.htm|archive-date=6 March 2012|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the case history reports in the older psychiatric literature that formed the basis of Noll's parody, the condition starts with a key event in [[childhood]] that causes the experience of blood injury or the ingestion of blood to be exciting. After [[puberty]], the excitement is experienced as [[sexual arousal]]. Throughout [[adolescence]] and [[adulthood]], blood, its presence, and its consumption can also stimulate a sense of power and control. Noll speculated that Renfield's syndrome begins with [[autovampirism]] and then progresses to the consumption of the blood of other creatures.&lt;ref name=cl&gt;{{cite news |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |authorlink=Katherine Ramsland |title=Renfield's Syndrome |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/vampires/7.html |quote=Psychiatrists are aware that there exists a behavior known as "clinical vampirism," which is a syndrome involving the delusion of actually being a vampire and feeling the need for blood. This arises not from fiction and film but from the erotic attraction to blood and the idea that it conveys certain powers, although the actual manifestation of the fantasy may be influenced by fiction. It develops through fantasies involving sexual excitement. |publisher=[[Crime Library]] |accessdate=2007-12-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218202138/http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/weird/vampires/7.html |archive-date=2007-12-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usefulness of this diagnostic label remains in question.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Very few cases of the syndrome have been described, and the published reports that do exist refer to what has been proposed as Renfield's syndrome through the use of official psychiatric diagnostic categories such as [[schizophrenia]] or as a variety of [[paraphilia]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13931">[[Epigenetics]] is a broad term that refers to changes in [[gene expression]] that occur via mechanisms such as [[DNA methylation]], [[histone acetylation]], and [[microRNA]] modification. When these epigenetics changes are [[Heritability|heritable]], they can influence [[evolution]].  Current research indicates that epigenetics has influenced evolution in a number of [[organism]]s, including [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Suter CM, Boffelli D, Martin DIK. 2013 [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1771/20130903.full A role for epigenetic inheritance in modern evolutionary theory? A comment in response to Dickins and Rahman]. Proc R Soc B 280: 20130903. doi: 10.1098/rspb.2013.0903&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Plants ==
=== Overview ===
DNA methylation and histone modification are two mechanisms used to regulate gene expression in plants. DNA methylation can be mitotically and meiotically stable, allowing for methylation states to be passed to other orthologous genes in a genome. DNA methylation can be reversed via the use of enzymes known as DNA de-methylases, while histone modiciations can be reversed via removing histone acetyl groups with deacetylases. Interspecific differences due to environmental factors are shown to be associated with the difference between [[annual plant|annual]] and [[perennial]] life cycles. There can be varying adaptive responses based on this.&lt;ref&gt;Turck F, Coupland G.: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12286/abstract Natural variation in epigenetic gene regulation and its effects on plant developmental traits]. ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]''. 2013 Oct 7. {{doi|10.1111/evo.12286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arabidopsis thaliana ===
Forms of [[histone methylation]] cause repression of certain genes that are stably inherited through mitosis but that can also be erased during meiosis or with the progression of time. The induction of [[flowering]] by exposure to low winter temperatures in [[Arabidopsis thaliana]] shows this effect. Histone methylation participates in repression of expression of an inhibitor of flowering during cold. In annual, [[semelparous]] species such as Arabidopsis thaliana, this histone methylation is stably inherited through mitosis after return from cold to warm temperatures giving the plant the opportunity to flower continuously during spring and summer until it senesces. However, in perennial, [[iteroparous]] relatives the histone modification rapidly disappears when temperatures rise, allowing expression of the floral inhibitor to increase and limiting flowering to a short interval. Epigenetic histone modifications control a key adaptive trait in Arabidopsis thaliana, and their pattern changes rapidly during evolution associated with reproductive strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Turck F, Coupland G.: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.12286/abstract Natural variation in epigenetic gene regulation and its effects on plant developmental traits]. Evolution. 2013 Oct 7. doi: 10.1111/evo.12286&lt;/ref&gt;
Another study tested several epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) of Arabidopsis thaliana - lines with similar genomes but varying levels of DNA methylation - for their drought sensitivity and their sensitivity to nutritional stress. It was found that there was a significant amount of heritable variation in the lines in regards to traits important for survival of drought and nutrient stress. This study proved that variation in DNA methylation can result in heritable variation of ecologically important plant traits, such as root allocation, [[drought tolerance]], and nutrient [[Phenotypic plasticity|plasticity]]. It also hinted that epigenetic variation alone could result in rapid evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Y.-Y., Fischer, M., Colot, V. and Bossdorf, O. (2013), [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.12010/abstract Epigenetic variation creates potential for evolution of plant phenotypic plasticity]. New Phytologist, 197: 314–322. doi: 10.1111/nph.12010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dandelions ===

Scientists found that changes in DNA methylation induced by stress was inherited in [[asexual reproduction|asexual]] [[dandelions]]. Genetically similar plants were exposed to different ecological stresses, and their offspring were raised in an unstressed environment. Amplified fragment-length polymorphism markers that were methylation-sensitive were used to test for methylation on a genome-wide scale. It was found that many of the environmental stresses caused induction of pathogen and herbivore defenses, which caused methylation in the genome. These modifications were then genetically transmitted to the offspring dandelions. The transgenerational inheritance of a stress response can contribute to the heritable plasticity of the organism, allowing it to better survive environmental stresses. It also helps add to the [[genetic variation]] of specific lineages with little variability, giving a greater chance of [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref&gt;Koen J. F. Verhoeven, Jeroen J. Jansen, Peter J. van Dijk and Arjen Biere.

New Phytologist(2010) 185: 1108–1118. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-8137.2009.03121.x&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Animals ==

=== Primates ===

A comparative analysis of [[CpG site|CpG]] methylation patterns between humans and primates found that there were more than 800 genes that varied in their methylation patterns among orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos. Despite these apes having the same genes, methylation differences are what account for their [[phenotypic variation]]. The genes in question are involved in development. It is not the protein sequences that account for the differences in physical characteristics between humans and apes; rather, it is the epigenetic changes to the genes. Since humans and the great apes share 99% of their DNA, it is thought that the differences in methylation patterns account for their distinction. So far, there are known to be 171 genes that are uniquely methylated in humans, 101 genes that are uniquely methylated in chimpanzees and bonobos, 101 genes that are uniquely methylated in gorillas, and 450 genes that are uniquely methylated in orangutans. For example, genes involved in blood pressure regulation and the development of the inner ear’s semicircular canal are highly methylated in humans, but not in the apes. There are also 184 genes that are conserved at the protein level between human and chimpanzees, but have epigenetic differences. Enrichments in multiple independent gene categories show that regulatory changes to these genes have given humans their specific traits. This research shows that epigenetics plays an important role in evolution in primates.&lt;ref&gt;Hernando-Herraez I, Prado-Martinez J, Garg P, Fernandez-Callejo M, Heyn H, et al. (2013) [http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1003763 Dynamics of DNA Methylation in Recent Human and Great Ape Evolution]. PLoS Genet 9(9): e1003763. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003763&lt;/ref&gt;
It has also been shown that cis-regulatory elements changes affect the transcription start sites (TSS) of genes. 471 DNA sequences are found to be enriched or depleted in regards to histone trimethylation at the H3K4 histone in chimpanzee, human, and macaque prefrontal cortexes. Among these sequences, 33 are selectively methylated in neuronal [[chromatin]] from children and adults, but not from non-neuronal chromatin. One [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] that was selectively methylated was [[DPP10]], a [[regulatory sequence]] that showed evidence of hominid adaptation, such as higher [[nucleotide substitution]] rates and certain regulatory sequences that were missing in other primates. Epigenetic regulation of TSS chromatin has been identified as an important development in the evolution of gene expression networks in the human brain. These networks are thought to play a role in [[cognitive processes]] and [[neurological disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;Shulha HP, Crisci JL, Reshetov D, Tushir JS, Cheung I, et al. (2012) [http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001427 Human-Specific Histone Methylation Signatures at Transcription Start Sites in Prefrontal Neurons]. PLoS Biol 10(11): e1001427. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1001427&lt;/ref&gt;
An analysis of methylation profiles of humans and primate [[sperm cells]] reveals epigenetic regulation plays an important role here as well. Since mammalian cells undergo reprogramming of DNA methylation patterns during [[germ cell]] development, the methylomes of human and chimp sperm can be compared to methylation in [[embryonic stem cells]] (ESCs). There were many hypomethylated regions in both sperms cells and ESCs that showed structural differences. Also, many of the [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]]s in human and chimp sperm cells had different amounts of methylation. In essence, DNA methylation patterns differ between germ cells and [[somatic cells]] as well as between the human and chimpanzee sperm cells. Meaning, differences in promoter methylation could possible account for the phenotypic differences between humans and primates.&lt;ref&gt;Molaro A, Hodges E, Fang F, Song Q, McCombie WR, et al. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411009421 Sperm methylation profiles reveal features of epigenetic inheritance and evolution in primates]. Cell. 2011;146:1029–41. doi: 10.1016/j.cell.2011.08.016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chickens ===

Red Junglefowl, ancestor of domestic chickens, show that gene expression and methylation profiles in the [[thalamus]] and [[hypothalamus]] differed significantly from that of a domesticated egg laying breed. Methylation differences and gene expression were maintained in the offspring, depicting that epigenetic variation is inherited. Some of the inherited methylation differences were specific to certain tissues, and the differential methylation at specific loci were not altered much after intercrossing between Red Junglefowl and domesticated laying hens for eight generations.The results hint that domestication has led to epigenetic changes, as domesticated chickens maintained a higher level of methylation for more than 70% of the genes.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Natt, Carl-Johan Rubin, Dominic Wright, Martin Johnsson, Johan Belteky, Leif Andersson, Per Jensen. [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/13/59 Heritable genome-wide variation of gene expression and promoter methylation between wild and domesticated chickens]. BMC Genomics, 2012; 13 (1): 59 DOI: 10.1186/1471-2164-13-59&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in Evolution ==

The role of epigenetics in evolution is clearly linked to the selective pressures that regulate that process. As organisms leave offspring that are best suited to their environment, environmental stresses change DNA gene expression that are further passed down to their offspring, allowing for them also to better thrive in their environment. The classic case study of the rats who experience licking and grooming from their mothers pass this trait to their offspring shows that a [[mutation]] in the DNA sequence is not required for a heritable change.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E. Dickins and Qazi Rahman. [http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/early/2012/05/10/rspb.2012.0273 The extended evolutionary synthesis and the role of soft inheritance in evolution]. Proc. R. Soc. B 2012 279, doi: 10.1098/rspb.2012.0273&lt;/ref&gt; Basically, a high degree of maternal nurturing makes the offspring of that mother more likely to nurture their own children with a high degree of care as well. Rats with a lower degree of maternal nurturing are less likely to nurture their own offspring with so much care. Also, rates of epigenetic mutations, such as DNA methylation, are much higher than rates of mutations transmitted genetically&lt;ref&gt;Rando OJ, Verstrepen KJ (February 2007). [http://www.cell.com/cell/abstract/S0092-8674(07)00121-3 Timescales of genetic and epigenetic inheritance]. Cell 128 (4): 655–68. doi:10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.023&lt;/ref&gt; and are easily reversed.&lt;ref&gt;Lancaster, Alex K.; [[Joanna Masel|Masel, Joanna]] (1 September 2009). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2770902/ The evolution of reversible switches in the presence of irreversible mimics]. Evolution 63 (9): 2350–2362. doi:10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00729.x&lt;/ref&gt; This provides a way for variation within a species to rapidly increase, in times of stress, providing opportunity for adaptation to newly arising selection pressures.

== Controversy ==

[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] proposed that species experience certain obstacles in their lifetimes which they must overcome. They acquire certain characteristics to deal with these challenges, and such accumulations are then passed to their offspring. In modern terms, this transmission from parent to offspring would be considered a method of epigenetic inheritance. Scientists are now questioning the framework of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], as epigenetics has shown to be in direct contrast with the core of [[Darwinism]] while being in agreement with [[Lamarckism]]. While some evolutionary biologists have dismissed epigenetics' impact on evolution entirely, others have begun to discover that a fusion of both epigenetic and traditional genetic inheritance may contribute to the variations seen in species today.&lt;ref&gt;Pennisi E.

In [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthmoving]], '''cut and fill''' is the process of constructing a [[railway]], [[road]] or [[canal]] whereby the amount of material from [[Cut (earthmoving)|cuts]] roughly matches the amount of fill needed to make nearby [[Embankment (transportation)|embankments]], so minimizing the amount of construction labor.

==Overview==
Cut slopes are rarely created greater than a slope of two to one (horizontal to vertical dimensions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webs1.uidaho.edu/niatt_labmanual/Chapters/roadwaydesign/theoryandconcepts/CutAndFillSections.htm Roadway design theory and concepts]&lt;/ref&gt;
Cut sections of roadway or rail are characterized by the roadway being lower in elevation than the surrounding terrain. From an operational standpoint there are unique environmental effects associated with cut sections of roadway. For example, air pollutants can concentrate in the ‘'valleys'‘ created by the cut section.  Conversely, [[noise pollution]] is mitigated by cut sections since an effective blockage of line of sight sound propagation is created by the depressed roadway design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/x1707075n815g604/ C.Michael Hogan, '' Analysis of highway noise''], Journal of Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution, Volume 2, Number 3, Biomedical and Life Sciences and Earth and Environmental Science Issue, Pages 387-392, September, 1973, Springer Verlag, Netherlands {{ISSN|0049-6979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fill section==
Fill sections manifest as elevated sections of a roadway or trackbed.  Environmental effects of fill sections are typically favorable with respect to air pollution dispersal, but in the matter of [[roadway noise|sound propagation]], exposure of nearby residents is generally increased, since [[sound wall]]s and other forms of sound path blockage are less effective in this geometry.

There are a variety of reasons for creating fills, among them reduction of [[Grade (slope)|grade]] along a route or elevation of the route above water, swampy ground, or areas where snow drifts frequently collect. Fills can also be used to cover tree stumps, rocks, or unstable soil, in which case material with a higher bearing capacity is placed on top of the obstacle in order to carry the weight of the roadway or railway and reduce differential settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert L. Nichols, Jr., and David A. Day, P.E., ''Moving the Earth: The Workbook of Excavation,'' 5th ed. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005), pp. 8.16 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The practice of cut-and-fill was widely utilized to construct tracks along rolling terrain across the British Isles.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} It was later performed on new dwellings for returned soldiers in Ireland at the end of World War II. This application was developed by Irish railway engineer Lachlan J. Boland, who saw the benefits of introducing railway practices to residential construction.

== Software ==
A number of software products are available for calculating cut and fill.  A simple approach involves defining different earthworks features in a software program and then adjusting elevations manually to calculate the optimal cut and fill.  More sophisticated software is able to automatically balance cut and fill and take account of materials.  Software that can do this falls under the broad category of [[Comparison of Earthworks Estimation Software|earthworks estimation software]].

'''Doxa''' ([[ancient Greek]] δόξα; from verb δοκεῖν ''dokein'', "to appear", "to seem", "to think" and "to accept"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddoke%2Fw δοκέω] in Liddell and Scott&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning common [[belief]] or popular [[opinion]]. Used by the Greek [[rhetorics|rhetoricians]] as a tool for the formation of argument by using common opinions, the ''doxa'' was often manipulated by [[sophist]]s to [[persuasion|persuade]] the [[people]], leading to [[Plato]]'s condemnation of [[Athenian democracy]].

The word ''doxa'' picked up a new meaning between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC when the [[Septuagint]] translated the Hebrew word for "glory" (כבוד, ''kavod'') as ''doxa''. This translation of the Hebrew Scriptures was used by the [[early church]] and is quoted frequently by the New Testament authors. The effects of this new meaning of ''doxa'' as "glory" is made evident by the [[ubiquitous]] use of the word throughout the New Testament and in the worship services of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], where the glorification of God in true worship is also seen as true belief. In that context, doxa reflects behavior or practice in worship, and the belief of the whole church rather than personal opinion. It is the unification of these multiple meanings of doxa that is reflected in the modern terms of [[orthodoxy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=orthodox |title="Orthodox" Etymology |accessdate=2008-07-01 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[heterodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heterodox |title="Heterodox" Etymology |accessdate=2008-07-01 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ware |first1=Bishop Kallistos (Timothy) |authorlink1=Kallistos Ware |title=The Orthodox Church |edition=new |pages=8,266 |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Penguin Books |date=29 Apr 1993 |isbn=978-0-14-014656-1 |ref=none }}&lt;/ref&gt; This semantic merging in the word ''doxa'' is also seen in Russian word слава (''slava''), which means ''glory'', but is used with the meaning of ''belief'', ''opinion'' in words like православие (''pravoslavie'', meaning ''orthodoxy'', or, literally, ''true belief'').

==Doxa, a philosopheme==
In Plato's [[Gorgias (dialogue)]], Plato presents the Sophists, rhetors who taught people how to speak for the promise of commercial success, as wordsmiths that ensnare and use the malleable doxa of the "multitude" to their advantage without shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/gorgias.html |title='Gorgias |last=Plato |date= 380 B.C.E.  |trans-title=Benjamin Jowett |publisher=[[Internet Classics Archive]] |accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this and other writings, Plato relegated doxa as being a belief, unrelated to reason, that resided in the unreasoning, lower-parts of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sorabji |first1=Richard|editor-last=Nussbaum |editor-first=Martha C.|date= March 26, 1992 |title= Essays on Aristotle's De Anima |publisher= Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint extended into the concept of doxasta in Plato's [[Theory of Forms]], which states that physical objects are manifestations of doxa and are thus not in their true form.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last= Szaif |first= Jan |date= 2007 |title= Doxa and Episteme as Modes of Acquaintance in Republic V |url= http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/people/jmszaif/jan-szaifs-home-page/talks-and-final-drafts/doxa-and-episteme-as-modes-of-acquaintance-in-republic-v/view |journal= Les Etudes Platoniciennes |publisher= Les Belles Lettres |volume= IV |pages= 253–272 |accessdate= 2 March 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140306030717/http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/people/jmszaif/jan-szaifs-home-page/talks-and-final-drafts/doxa-and-episteme-as-modes-of-acquaintance-in-republic-v/view |archivedate= 6 March 2014 |df=  }} &lt;/ref&gt; Plato's framing of ''doxa'' as the opponent of [[knowledge]] led to the classical opposition of [[error]] to [[truth]], which has since become a major concern in [[Western philosophy]]. (However, in the ''Theaetetus'' and in the ''Meno'', Plato has [[Socrates]] suggest that knowledge is ''orthos doxa'' for which one can provide a ''logos'', thus initiating the traditional definition of knowledge as "[[justified true belief]]".) Thus, error is considered in [[Western world|Occident]] as pure negativity, which can take various forms, among them the form of [[illusion]]. As such, ''doxa'' may ironically be defined as the "philosopher's sin" {{citation needed|reason=interesting idea, but needs evidence|date=January 2016}}. In classical rhetoric, it is contrasted with ''[[episteme]]''.

Plato's student [[Aristotle]] objected to Plato's theory of doxa. Aristotle perceived that doxa's value was in practicality and common usage, in contrast with Plato's philosophical purity relegating doxa to deception. Further, Aristotle held doxa as the first step in finding knowledge, as doxa had found applications in the physical world and those who held it had a great number of tests done to prove it and thus reason to believe it.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url= http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/sageukcst/doxa/0 |title= Doxa |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2005  |website= Credo Reference |publisher= Sage UK |accessdate=March 2, 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle clarifies this by categorizing the accepted truths of the physical world that are passed down from generation to generation as ''endoxa''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=Eggs |first= Ekkehard |last2= McElholm |first2= Dermot |date= 2002 |title= Doxa in Poetry: A Study of Aristotle's Poetics |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/poetics_today/v023/23.3eggs.pdf |journal= Poetics Today  |publisher= Duke University Press |volume= 23 |pages= 395-426 |accessdate= March 1, 2014 |doi=10.1215/03335372-23-3-395}} &lt;/ref&gt; Endoxa is a more stable belief than ''doxa'', because it has been "tested" in argumentative struggles in the ''[[Polis]]'' by prior interlocutors. The use of ''endoxa'' in the Stagirite's ''[[Organon]]'' can be found in Aristotle's ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'' and ''[[Rhetoric]]''.

==Use in sociology and anthropology&lt;!--linked from 'Pierre Bourdieu'--&gt;==

[[Pierre Bourdieu]], in his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'',&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1977 [1972]. Outline of a Theory of Practice. R. Nice, transl. Volume 16. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; used the term ''doxa'' to denote what is taken for granted in any particular society. The ''doxa'', in his view, is the experience by which "the natural and social world appears as self-evident".&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu (1972); p.164&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses what falls within the limits of the thinkable and the sayable ("the universe of possible discourse"), that which "goes without saying because it comes without saying".&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu (1972); pp. 167, 169&lt;/ref&gt; The humanist instances of Bourdieu's application of notion of ''doxa'' are to be traced in ''Distinction'' where ''doxa'' sets limits on social mobility within the social space through limits imposed on the characteristic consumption of each social individual: certain cultural artifacts are recognized by ''doxa'' as being inappropriate to actual social position, hence ''doxa'' helps to petrify social limits, the "sense of one's place", and one's sense of belonging, which is closely connected with the idea that "this is not for us" (''ce n'est pas pour nous''). Thus individuals become voluntary subjects of those incorporated mental structures that deprive them of more deliberate consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1979. La Distinction. Critique Sociale du Jugement. Paris: Les éditions de minuit. Page 549&lt;/ref&gt;

Doxa and opinion denote, respectively, a society's taken-for-granted, unquestioned truths, and the sphere of that which may be openly contested and discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/pers/bourdieu_pierre.htm Pierre Bourdieu - AnthroBase - Dictionary of Anthropology: A searchable database of anthropological texts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu explains the term "doxa" in his interview with theorist [[Terry Eagleton]]. To explain the term, he uses an example about the common beliefs in school. He asked students what qualifies as achievement in school. In response, the students on the lower end of the academic spectrum viewed themselves as being inferior or not as smart as the students who excelled. The responses are where doxa comes into play, because that was the common belief and attitude that the students had based on what society pushed them to believe. Bourdieu believes that doxa derived from socialization, because socialization also deals with beliefs deriving from society, and as we grow up in the environment, we tend to believe what society tells us is correct.

It is a socially accepted misconception, that if you do not score as high as someone else then you are obviously not as smart as they are. Scores do not prove that one is smarter, because there are many different factors that play into what you score on a test. People may excel within a certain topic and fail at another. However, even though it is a misconception, people tend to partake in common practices to make themselves feel better. For example, the students who feel inferior due to popular belief that they are not as smart as the students who score higher than them, may experiment with drugs to ease the insecurities they face. Bourdieu believes that doxa is more than common belief. He believes that it also has the potential to give rise to common action.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. and Eagleton, T. "Doxa and common life". New Left Review, 1992, p. 199, 111-121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernon, Phillip E. "Intelligence and Cultural Environment". London: Methuen, 1969, p 215. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in democracy==

While doxa is used as a tool for the formation of [[argument]], it should be noted that it is also formed by argument. The former can be understood as told by [[James A. Herrick]] in ''The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction'': "The Sophists in Gorgias hold that rhetoric creates truth that is useful for the moment out of doxa, or the opinions of the people, through the process of argument and counterargument. Socrates will have no part of this sort of 'truth' which, nevertheless, is essential to a democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herrick|first=James, A.|title=The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction, 3rd ed.|year=2005|publisher=Allyn and Bacon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly noted, democracy, which by definition is the manifestation of public opinion, is dependent upon, and therefore also constrained by, the same limits imposed upon the individuals responsible for its establishment. Due to compromised opinions within a society, as well as opinions not counted for due to inaccessibility and apathy, doxa is not [[homogeneous]], nor is it created agreeably. Rather, it is pliable and imperfect—the outcome of an ongoing power struggle between clashing "truths".
 
To expand upon the quote from his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'' in the above section, "Use in sociology and anthropology", Bourdieu writes, "When there is a quasi-perfect correspondence between the objective order and the subjective principles of organization (as in ancient societies) the natural and social world appears as self-evident. This experience we shall call doxa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=Outline of a Theory of Practice|year=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Smith of the [[University of Chicago]] observes in his article "The limitations of doxa: agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view": "Bourdieu consigns the practices of the denizens of ancient societies to the realm of doxa, their lives cast as routines predicated upon the mis-recognition of social orders as natural ways of life, rather than political products."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Adam T.|title=The Limitations of Doxa: Agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view|journal=Journal of Social Archaeology|year=2001|volume=1|issue=2|page=156|doi=10.1177/146960530100100201}}&lt;/ref&gt; This calls to attention that the notion of social order as naturally occurring is misperceived, disregarding its creation by political argumentation.
 
Doxa, then, can be understood as created by argument as well as used in the formation of argument, essential for the establishment of democratic policies.

'''Environmental psychology''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field that focuses on the interplay between individuals and their surroundings. It examines the way in which the natural environment and our built environments shape us as individuals. The field defines the term environment broadly, encompassing [[natural environment]]s, [[Social environment|social settings]], [[built environment]]s, learning environments, and informational environments.

Environmental psychology was not fully recognized as its own field until the late 1960s when scientists began to question the tie between human behavior and our natural and built environments. Since its conception, the field has been committed to the development of a discipline that is both [[value (personal and cultural)|value oriented]] and [[problem solving|problem oriented]], prioritizing research aimed at solving complex [[Environmental issue|environmental problems]] in the pursuit of individual [[Quality of life|well-being within a larger society]].&lt;ref name=Proshansky87&gt;Proshansky 1987&lt;/ref&gt; When solving problems involving [[Environmental sociology|human-environment interaction]]s, whether global or local, one must have a model of human nature that predicts the environmental conditions under which humans will [[Human behavior|respond well]]. This model can help design, manage, protect and/or restore environments that enhance reasonable behavior, predict the likely outcomes when these conditions are not met, and diagnose problem situations. The field develops such a model of human nature while retaining a broad and inherently multidisciplinary focus. It explores such dissimilar issues as [[Common-pool resource|common property resource management]], [[wayfinding]] in complex settings, the effect of [[environmental stress]] on human performance, the characteristics of [[environmental restoration|restorative environment]]s, human [[information processing]], and the promotion of durable conservation behavior. Lately, alongside the increased focus on climate change in society and the social sciences and the re-emergence of limits-to-growth concerns, there has been increased focus on environmental sustainability issues within the field.&lt;ref&gt;DeYoung 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

This multidisciplinary paradigm has not only characterized the dynamic for which environmental psychology is expected to develop. It has also been the catalyst in attracting other schools of knowledge in its pursuit, aside from research psychologists. [[Geographer]]s, [[economist]]s, [[landscape architect]]s, [[Politician|policy-makers]], [[sociologist]]s, [[anthropologist]]s, [[educator]]s, and product developers all have discovered and participated in this field.&lt;ref name=Proshansky87 /&gt;

Although "environmental psychology" is arguably the best-known and most comprehensive description of the field, it is also known as human factors science, cognitive [[ergonomics]], [[ecological psychology]], [[ecopsychology]], environment–behavior studies, and person–environment studies. Closely related fields include [[architectural psychology]], [[socio-architecture]], [[behavioral geography]], [[environmental sociology]], [[Social ecology (academic field)|social ecology]], and [[environmental design]] research.

==History==
The origins of this field of study are unknown, however, [[Willy Hellpach]] is said to be the first to mention "environmental psychology". One of his books, ''Geopsyche'', discusses topics such as how the sun and the moon affect human activity, the impact of extreme environments, and the effects of color and form (Pol, E., 2006, ''Blueprints for a history of environmental psychology (I): From first birth to American transition''. "Medio Ambiente y Comportamiento Humano", 7(2), 95-113). Among the other major scholars at the roots of environmental psychology were [[Jakob von Uexküll]], [[Kurt Lewin]], [[Egon Brunswik]], and later [[Gerhard Kaminski]] and [[Carl Friedrich Graumann]].&lt;ref&gt;Allesch 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of World War II brought about a higher demand for developments in the field of [[social psychology]] particularly in the areas of [[attitude change]], [[Communication in small groups|small group processes]], and intergroup conflict. This demand caused psychologists to begin applying social psychology theories to a number of social issues such as [[prejudice]], war and peace. It was thought that if these problems were addressed, underlying notions and principles would surface.

Although this period was crucial to the development of the field, the methodologies used to carry out the studies were questionable.{{according to whom|date=July 2014}} At the time, studies were being conducted in a [[Laboratory|laboratory setting]], which caused some doubt{{to whom?|date=July 2014}} as to their validity in the real world. Consequently, environmental psychologists began to conduct [[Field experiment|studies outside of the laboratory]], enabling the field to continue to progress.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Today environmental psychology is being applied to many different areas such as architecture and design, television programs and advertisements.

==Orientations==
{{clarify|this section needs an introductory paragraph, providing an overview of the various orientations to environmental psychology; the same type of suggestion applies to the next two sections, as well|date=July 2014}}

===Problem oriented===
Environmental psychology is a direct study of the relationship between an environment and how that environment affects its inhabitants. Specific aspects of this field work by identifying a problem and through the identification of said problem, discovering a solution. Therefore, it is necessary for environmental psychology to be problem oriented.

One important aspect of a problem-oriented field is that by identifying problems, solutions arise from the research acquired. The solutions can aid in making society function better as a whole and create a wealth of knowledge about the inner workings of societies. Environmental psychologist Harold Proshansky discusses how the field is also "value oriented" because of the field's commitment to bettering society through problem identification.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Proshansky 1987, p.1477&lt;/ref&gt; Proshansky discusses the importance of not only understanding the problem but also the necessity of a solution. Proshansky also points out some of the problems of a problem-oriented approach for environmental psychology. First the problems being identified must be studied under certain specifications: it must be ongoing and occurring in real life, not in a laboratory. Second, the notions about the problems must derive directly from the source – meaning they must come directly from the specific environment where the problem is occurring.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The solutions and understanding of the problems cannot come from an environment that has been constructed and modeled to look like real life. Environmental psychology needs to reflect the actual society not a society built in a laboratory setting. The difficult task of the environmental psychologist is to study problems as they are occurring in everyday life.&lt;ref name=Proshansky1478&gt;Proshansky 1987, p.1478&lt;/ref&gt; It is hard to reject all laboratory research because laboratory experiments are where theories may be tested without damaging the actual environment or can serve as models when testing solutions. Proshansky makes this point as well, discussing the difficulty in the overall problem oriented approach. He states that it is important, however, for the environmental psychologist to utilize all aspects of research and analysis of the findings and to take into account both the general and individualized aspects of the problems.&lt;ref name=Proshansky1479&gt;Proshansky 1987, p.1479&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental psychology addresses environmental problems such as density and crowding, [[noise pollution]], [[Poverty|sub-standard living]], and [[urban decay]].&lt;ref name=ReferenceA /&gt; Noise increases environmental stress. Although it has been found that control and predictability are the greatest factors in stressful effects of noise; context, pitch, source and habituation are also important variables [3]. Environmental psychologists have theorized that density and crowding can also have an adverse effect on mood and may cause [[stress-related illness]]. To understand and solve environmental problems, environmental psychologists believe concepts and principles should come directly from the physical settings and problems being looked at.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For example, factors that reduce feelings of crowding within buildings include:

* Windows – particularly ones that can be opened and ones that provide a view as well as light
* High ceilings
* Doors to divide spaces (Baum and Davies){{full citation needed|date=July 2014}} and provide access control
* Room shape – square rooms feel less crowded than rectangular ones (Dresor){{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}
* Using partitions to create smaller, personalized spaces within an open plan office or larger work space.
* Providing increases in cognitive control over aspects of the internal environment, such as ventilation, light, privacy, etc.
* Conducting a cognitive appraisal of an environment and feelings of crowding in different settings. For example, one might be comfortable with crowding at a concert but not in school corridors.
* Creating a defensible space (Calhoun){{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}

====Personal space and territory====
Having an area of personal territory in a public space, e.g., at the office, is a key feature of many architectural designs. Having such a 'defensible space' can reduce the negative effects of crowding in urban environments. The term, coined by [[John B. Calhoun]] in 1947, is the result of multiple environmental experiments conducted on rats. Originally beginning as an experiment to measure how many rats could be accommodated in a given space, it expanded into determining how rats, given the proper food, shelter and bedding would behave under a confined environment.

Under these circumstances, the males became aggressive, some exclusively homosexual. Others became pansexual and hypersexual, seeking every chance to mount any rat they encountered. As a result, mating behaviors were upset with an increase in infant mortalities. With parents failing to provide proper nests, thoughtlessly ditching their young and even attacking them, infant mortality rose as high as 96% in certain sections. Calhoun published the results as "Population Density and Social Pathology" in a 1962 edition of ''[[Scientific American]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Calhoun | first=John B. | date=February 1, 1962 | title=Population density and social pathology | journal=''[[Scientific American]]'' | volume=206 | issue=2 | pages=139–148 | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/population-density-and-social-patho/ | access-date=June 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creating barriers and customizing the space are ways of creating personal space, e.g., using pictures of one's family in an office setting. This increases cognitive control as one sees oneself as having control over the competitors to the personal space and therefore able to control the level of density and crowding in the space.

===Systems oriented===
The systems oriented approach to experimenting is applied to individuals or people that are a part of communities, groups, and organizations. This approach particularly examines group interaction, as opposed to an individual's interaction and it emphasizes on factors of social integration. In the laboratory, experiments focus on cause and effect processes within human nature.&lt;ref name=Proshansky1481&gt;Proshansky 1987, p.1481&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interdisciplinary oriented===
Environmental psychology relies on interaction with other disciplines in order to approach problems with multiple perspectives. The first discipline is the category of behavioral sciences, which include: sociology, political science, anthropology, and economics. Environmental psychology also interacts with the interspecializations of the field of psychology, which include: [[developmental psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[industrial and organizational psychology]], psychobiology, [[psychoanalysis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hendrix | first=John Shannon | authorlink=John Shannon Hendrix | date=April 12, 2013 | title=Architecture and dream construction | journal=Center | volume=17 | issue=Space &amp; Psyche | publisher=Center for American Architecture &amp; Design | isbn=0-934951-17-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social neuroscience. In addition to the more scientific fields of study, environmental psychology also works with the design field which includes: the studies of architecture, interior design, urban planning, industrial and object design, landscape architecture, and preservation.&lt;ref name=Proshansky1482&gt;Proshansky 1987, p.1482&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space-over-time orientation===
Space over time orientation highlights the importance of the past. Examining problems with the past in mind creates a better understanding of how past forces, such as social, political, and economic forces, may be of relevance to present and future problems.&lt;ref&gt;Rivlin 1990, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; Time and place are also important to consider. It's important to look at time over extended periods. Physical settings change over time; they change with respect to physical properties and they change because individuals using the space change over time.&lt;ref name=Proshansky1485&gt;Proshansky 1987, p.1485&lt;/ref&gt; Looking at these spaces over time will help monitor the changes and possibly predict future problems.

There are a variety of tests that can be administered to children in order to determine their temperament. Temperament is split up into three types: "easy", "difficult", and "slow-to-warm-up". Alexander Thomas, Stella Chess, Herbert G. Birch, Margaret Hertzig and Sam Korn created an infant temperament test in the 1950s and rated them using nine temperament criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Chess &amp; Birch, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; By finding out a child's temperament at birth, it enables us to know what to expect as the child progresses into adulthood.

==Concepts==

===Place identity===
{{Main|Place identity}}

For many years Harold Proshansky and his colleagues at the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York, explored the concept of place identity. Place identity has been traditionally defined as a 'sub-structure of the self-identity of the person consisting of broadly conceived cognitions about the physical world in which the individual lives'.&lt;ref name=Proshanskyet59&gt;Proshansky et al. 1983, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; These cognitions define the daily experiences of every human being. Through one's attitudes, feelings, ideas, memories, personal values and preferences toward the range and type of physical settings, he/she can then understand the environment they live in and their overall experience.

As a person interacts with various places and spaces, he/she is able to evaluate which properties in different environments fulfill his/her various needs. When a place contains components that satisfy a person biologically, socially, psychologically and/or culturally, it creates the environmental past of a person. Through 'good' or 'bad' experiences with a place, a person is then able to reflect and define their personal values, attitudes, feelings and beliefs about the physical world.

Place identity has been described as the individual's incorporation of place into the larger concept of self; a "potpourri of memories, conceptions, interpretations, ideas, and related feelings about specific physical settings, as well as types of settings".&lt;ref name=Proshanskyet&gt;Proshansky et al. 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
Other theorists have been instrumental in the creation of the idea of place identity. Three humanistic geographers, Tuan (1980), Relph (1976) and Buttimer (1980),{{full citation needed|date=July 2014}} share a couple of basic assumptions. As a person lives and creates memories within a place, attachment is built and it is through one's personal connection to a place, that he/she gains a sense of belonging and purpose, which then gives significance and meaning to their life.

Five central functions of place-identity have been depicted: recognition, meaning, expressive-requirement, mediating change, and anxiety and defense function. Place identity becomes a cognitive "database" against which every physical setting is experienced.&lt;ref name=Proshanskyet /&gt; The activities of a person often overlap with physical settings, which then create a background for the rest of life's interactions and events. The individual is frequently unaware of the array of feelings, values or memories of a singular place and simply becomes more comfortable or uncomfortable with certain broad kinds of physical settings, or prefers specific spaces to others. In the time since the term "place identity" was introduced, the theory has been the model for identity that has dominated environmental psychology.

===Place attachment===
{{Main|Place attachment}}

Many different perceptions of the bond between people and places have been hypothesized and studied. The most widespread terms include place attachment&lt;ref&gt;Low &amp; Altman 1992, Williams et al. 1992&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sense of place]].&lt;ref&gt;Cantrill 1998; Hay 1998; Shamai 1991; Steele 1981; Williams &amp; Stewart 1998&lt;/ref&gt; One consistent thread woven throughout most recent research on place attachment deals with the importance of the amount of time spent at a certain place (the length of association with a place). While both researchers and writers&lt;ref&gt;Low &amp; Altman 1992; Moore &amp; Graefe 1994; Relph 1976; Tuan 1977&lt;/ref&gt; have made the case that time and experience in a place are important for deepening the meanings and emotional ties central to the person-place relationship, little in-depth research has studied these factors and their role in forging this connection.&lt;ref&gt;Smaldone 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Place attachment is defined as one's emotional or affective ties to a place, and is generally thought to be the result of a long-term connection with a certain environment.&lt;ref&gt;Low &amp; Altman 1992&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from a simple aesthetic response such as saying a certain place is special because it is beautiful. For example, one can have an emotional response to a beautiful (or ugly) landscape or place, but this response may sometimes be shallow and fleeting. This distinction is one that Schroeder labeled "meaning versus preference". According to Schroeder the definition of "meaning" is "the thoughts, feelings, memories and interpretations evoked by a landscape"; whereas "preference" is "the degree of liking for one landscape compared to another".&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder 1991, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; For a deeper and lasting emotional attachment to develop (Or in Schroeder's terms, for it to have meaning) an enduring relationship with a place is usually a critical factor.&lt;ref&gt;Smaldone, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Chigbu carried out a rural study of place-attachment using a qualitative approach to check its impact on a community, Uturu (in Nigeria), and found that it has direct relationship to level of community development.&lt;ref&gt;Chigbu 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental consciousness===
[[Leanne Rivlin]] theorized that one way to examine an individual's environmental consciousness is to recognize how the physical place is significant, and look at the people/place relationship.

Environmental cognition (involved in human cognition) plays a crucial role in environmental perception.
All different areas of the brain engage with environmentally relevant information. Some believe that the orbitofrontal cortex integrates environmentally relevant information from many distributed areas of the brain. Due to its anterior location within the frontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex may make judgments about the environment, and refine the organism's "understanding" through error analysis, and other processes specific to prefrontal cortex. But to be certain, there is no single brain area dedicated to the organism's interactions with its environment. Rather, all brain areas are dedicated to this task. One area (probably the orbitofrontal cortex) may collate the various pieces of the informational puzzle in order to develop a long term strategy of engagement with the ever-changing "environment." Moreover, the orbitofrontal cortex may show the greatest change in blood oxygenation (BOLD level) when an organism thinks of the broad, and amorphous category referred to as "the environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orbitofrontal Cortex|url=http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/organ/orbitofrontal_cortex.htm|work=Orbitofrontal Cortex|publisher=wrongdiagnosis.com|accessdate=14 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the recent concern with the environment, environmental consciousness or awareness has come to be related to the growth and development of understanding and consciousness toward the biophysical environment and its problems.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Behavior settings===
The earliest noteworthy discoveries in the field of environmental psychology can be dated back to [[Roger Barker]] who created the field of ecological psychology. Founding his research station in Oskaloosa, Kansas in 1947, his field observations expanded into the theory that social settings influence behavior. Empirical data gathered in Oskaloosa from 1947 to 1972 helped him develop the concept of the "behavior setting" to help explain the relationship between the individual and the immediate environment. This was further explored in his work with Paul Gump in the book ''Big School, Small School: High School Size and Student Behavior''.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} One of the first insightful explanations on why groups tend to be less satisfying for their members as they increase in size, their studies illustrated that large schools had a similar number of behavior settings to that of small schools. This resulted in the students' ability to presume many different roles in small schools (e.g. be in the school band and the school football team) but in larger schools there was a propensity to deliberate over their social choices.

In his book ''Ecological Psychology'' (1968) Barker stresses the importance of the town's behavior and environment as the residents' most ordinary instrument of describing their environment. "The hybrid, eco-behavioral character of behavior settings appear to present Midwest's inhabitants with no difficulty; nouns that combine milieu and standing behavior are common, e.g. oyster supper, basketball game, turkey dinner, golden gavel ceremony, cake walk, back surgery, gift exchange, livestock auction, auto repair."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barker |first1=Roger G.|title=Ecological Psychology: Concepts and Methods for Studying the Environment of Human Behavior|date=1968|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford |isbn=9780804706582|page=94|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=p1arAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA94 |accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barker argued that his students should implement T-methods (psychologist as 'transducer': i.e. methods in which they studied man in his 'natural environment') rather than O-methods (psychologist as "operators" i.e. experimental methods). Basically, Barker preferred fieldwork and direct observation rather than controlled experiments. Some of the minute-by-minute observations of Kansan children from morning to night, jotted down by young and maternal graduate students, may be the most intimate and poignant documents in social science. Barker spent his career expanding on what he called ecological psychology, identifying these behavior settings, and publishing accounts such as ''One Boy's Day'' (1952) and ''Midwest and Its Children'' (1955).{{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Applications==

===Impact on the built environment===
Environmental psychologists rejected the laboratory-experimental paradigm because of its simplification and skewed view of the cause-and-effect relationships of human's behaviors and experiences. Environmental psychologists examine how one or more parameters produce an effect while other measures are controlled. It is impossible to manipulate real-world settings in a laboratory.&lt;ref name=Proshansky87 /&gt;

Environmental psychology is oriented towards influencing the work of design professionals (architects, engineers, interior designers, urban planners, etc.) and thereby improving the human environment.

On a civic scale, efforts towards improving pedestrian landscapes have paid off, to some extent, from the involvement of figures like [[Jane Jacobs]] and [[Copenhagen]]'s [[Jan Gehl]]. One prime figure here is the late writer and researcher [[William H. Whyte]]. His still-refreshing and perceptive "City", based on his accumulated observations of skilled Manhattan pedestrians, provides steps and patterns of use in urban plazas.

The role and impact of architecture on human behavior is debated within the architectural profession. Views range from: supposing that people will adapt to new architectures and city forms; believing that architects cannot predict the impact of buildings on humans and therefore should base decisions on other factors; to those who undertake detailed precedent studies of local building types and how they are used by that society.

Environmental psychology has conquered the whole architectural genre which is concerned with retail stores and any other commercial venues that have the power to manipulate the mood and behavior of customers (e.g. stadiums, casinos, malls, and now airports). From [[Philip Kotler]]'s landmark paper on Atmospherics and [[Alan Hirsch (neurologist)|Alan Hirsch]]'s "Effects of Ambient Odors on Slot-Machine Usage in a Las Vegas Casino", through the creation and management of the [[Gruen transfer]], retail relies heavily on psychology, original research, focus groups, and direct observation. One of William Whyte's students, [[Paco Underhill]], makes a living as a "shopping anthropologist". Most of this advanced research remains a trade secret and proprietary.

===Organizations===

* [[Project for Public Spaces]] (PPS) is a nonprofit organization that works to improve public spaces, particularly parks, civic centers, public markets, downtowns, and campuses. The staff of PPS is made up of individuals trained in environmental design, architecture, urban planning, urban geography, urban design, environmental psychology, landscape architecture, arts administration and information management. The organization has collaborated with many major institutions to improve the appearance and functionality of public spaces throughout the United States. In 2005, PPS co-founded The New York City Streets Renaissance, a campaign that worked to develop a new campaign model for transportation reform. This initiative implemented the transformation of excess sidewalk space in the [[Meatpacking District, Manhattan|Meatpacking District of Manhattan]] into public space. Also, by 2008, New York City reclaimed {{convert|49|acre|m2}} of traffic lanes and parking spots away from cars and gave it back to the public as bike lanes and public plazas.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}
* The '''Center for Human Environments''' at the [[CUNY Graduate Center]] is a research organization that examines the relationship between people and their physical settings. CHE has five subgroups that specialize in aiding specific populations: The Children's Environments Research Group, the Health and Society Research Group, the Housing Environments Research Group, the Public Space Research Group, and the Youth Studies Research Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.gc.cuny.edu/che/ Center for Human Environments], CUNY Graduate Center website&lt;/ref&gt;
* The most relevant scientific groups are the [[International Association of People-Environment Studies]] (IAPS) and the [[Environmental Design Research Association]] (EDRA).

==Challenges==
The field saw significant research findings and a fair surge of interest in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but has seen challenges of nomenclature, obtaining objective and repeatable results, scope, and the fact that some research rests on underlying assumptions about human perception, which is not fully understood. Being an interdisciplinary field is difficult because it lacks a solid definition and purpose. It is hard for the field to fit into organizational structures.&lt;ref name=Proshansky1476&gt;Proshansky 1987, p.1476&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Guido Francescato, speaking in 2000, environmental psychology encompasses a "somewhat bewildering array of disparate methodologies, conceptual orientations, and interpretations... making it difficult to delineate, with any degree of precision, just what the field is all about and what might it contribute to the construction of society and the unfolding of history."

Environmental psychology has not received nearly enough supporters to be considered an interdisciplinary field within psychology. Harold M. Proshanksy was one of the founders of environmental psychology and was quoted as saying "As I look at the field of environmental psychology today, I am concerned about its future. It has not, since its emergence in the early 1960s grown to the point where it can match the fields of social, personality, learning or cognitive psychology. To be sure, it has increased in membership, in the number of journals devoted to it, and even in the amount of professional organizational support it enjoys, but not enough so that one could look at any major university and find it to be a field of specialization in a department of psychology, or, more importantly, in an interdisciplinary center or institute".&lt;ref&gt;Proshansky 1995 Sammy Sum&lt;/ref&gt;

== University courses ==

* [[Antioch University New England]] Graduate School offers graduate programs involving environmental education through a planning approach. With environmental psychology being such a diverse field with many different approaches, students have a variety of programs to choose from.
* [[Arizona State University]] offers a master's in Environmental Resources, which takes more of a planning approach to the field.
* The Environmental Psychology Ph.D program at the [[CUNY Graduate Center]] takes a multidisciplinary approach to examining and changing "the serious problems associated with the urban environment with a view towards affecting public policy" using social science theory and research methods. The GC-CUNY was the first academic institution in the U.S. to grant a PhD in Environmental Psychology. As discussed in detail on the program website, "recent research has addressed the experiences of recently housed homeless people, the privatization of public space, socio-spatial conflicts, children's safety in the public environment, relocation, community based approaches to housing, the design of specialized environments such as museums, zoos, gardens and hospitals, the changing relationships between home, family and work, the environmental experiences of gay men and lesbians, and access to parks and other urban 'green spaces'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enviropsych.org|title=Environmental Psychology at the CUNY Graduate Center|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also The Center for Human Environments.
* [[Cornell University]]'s department of Design and Environmental Analysis offers undergraduate and graduate (Master of Science in Human Environment Relations, Master of Arts in Design, and Ph.D in Human Behavior and Design) studies in environmental psychology, interior design, sustainable design studies, human factors and ergonomics, and facility planning and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.human.cornell.edu/che/DEA/index.cfm|title=Design and Environmental Analysis|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Drexel University]] offers a Master of Science degree in Design Research. Of two degree paths, the Environmental Design and Health path includes study with community practitioners and researchers in design and related fields, including health, community design, and public policy. Research typically includes data collection and engaged research practices of design thinking and participatory design. This area of investigation has potential to create innovative health and educational partnerships, economic opportunities and neighborhood initiatives and relates to the strategic mission of the university to be highly engaged in civic sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://drexel.edu/westphal/academics/graduate/DSRE/Curriculum/|title=Curriculum - Westphal College of Media Arts &amp; Design|newspaper=Westphal College of Media Arts &amp; Design|access-date=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences]] offers a Master in Environmental psychology. The focus is on how people are affected by both physical and virtual environments, as well as how people affect nature. The program offers courses on environmental behaviour, environment and neuroscience, human factors, virtual environments and cognitive design, change management and greening organizations and architecture and estetics. 
* The [[Ohio State University]] City &amp; Regional Planning Program, in the School of Architecture, offers a specialization in environmental psychology (urban design/physical planning and behavior) at both the master's and PhD level. Dissertations have examined such topics as environmental aesthetics, spatial cognition, ethnic enclaves, neighborhood decline, neighborhood satisfaction, restorative and livable places, and behavior change.
* [[Prescott College]] offers a master's program that incorporates a number of the foundations of environmental psychology as well. The sub-fields in which the program provides includes environmental education, environmental studies, ecology, botany, resource policy, and planning. Another description about the program is as follows: "(The program) Includes instruction in contextual theory; statistics; physiological, social, and psychological responses to natural and technological hazards and disease; environmental perception and cognition; loneliness and stress; and psychological aspects of environmental design and planning."{{cite quote|date=July 2014}}
* [[University of California, Irvine]] offers a doctoral specialization in Design &amp; Behavior Research within the Department of Planning, Policy, and Design in the [[School of Social Ecology]], and undergraduate coursework in Environmental Psychology offered jointly by the Departments of Psychology and Social Behavior, Planning, Policy, and Design, and the Program in Public Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eee.uci.edu/11s/54150/index.html|title=Welcome to Environmental Psychology|publisher=|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[University of Michigan]] offers Master of Science and Master of Arts degrees in its new [http://www.seas.umich.edu/ School for Sustainability and Environment (SEAS)]. The focus is on how people affect and are affected by environments, and includes a pragmatic approach to promoting environmental stewardship behavior, as well as a focus on how "nearby nature" affects people's mental vitality, physical health and well-being. An emerging theme is helping people to remain optimistic while learning to respond well to increasingly difficult biophysical circumstances.
* Another strain of environmental psychology developed out of [[ergonomics]] in the 1960s. The beginning of this movement can be traced back to [[David Canter]]'s work and the founding of the "Performance Research Unit" at the [[University of Strathclyde]] in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1966, which expanded traditional ergonomics to study broader issues relating to the environment and the extent to which human beings were "situated" within it (cf situated cognition). Canter led the field in the UK for years and was the editor of the ''Journal of Environmental Psychology'' for over 20 years, but has recently turned his attention to criminology.
* The [[University of Surrey]] was the first institution that offered an architectural psychology course in the UK starting in 1973. Since then, there have been over 250 graduates from over 25 countries. The Environmental Psychology Research Group (EPRG) within the University of Surrey, of which students on the M.Sc in Environmental Psychology are automatically members, has been undertaking research for more than thirty years. EPRG's mission is to gain a better understanding of the environmental and psychological effects of space, no matter the size, with help from social sciences, psychology, and methodologies. There are four categories under which the research projects fall: sustainable development, environmental risk, architectural assessment and environmental design, and environmental education and interpretation. Other universities in the UK now offer courses on the subject, which is an expanding field.

== Biography ==
Eric McLuhan was the eldest of Marshall McLuhan's six children. He received his BSc in Communications from [[Wisconsin State University]] in 1972 and his M.A. and PhD in English Literature from the [[University of Dallas]] in 1980 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ericmcluhan.com/ Eric McLuhan]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he received the Neil Postman Award for Career Achievement in Public Intellectual Activity from the Media Ecology Association. In 2011, the University of St. Michael’s College in Toronto, Canada awarded him an L.L.D. of Sacred Letters.

Marshall McLuhan, [[Neil Postman]] and Eric McLuhan together coined the term '[[media ecology]] ' during a conversation in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdpi.com/2409-9287/1/2/126 Anton, Corey (2016). "On the Roots of Media Ecology: A Micro-History and Philosophical Clarification" in ''Philosophies'', pp.126–132]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marshall and Eric McLuhan co-authored the books ''Laws of Media: The New Science'' (1990), ''Media and Formal Cause'' (2011), and ''Theories of Communication'' (2011). According to McLuhan associate [[Dean Motter]], Eric also collaborated with his father on some books as a [[ghostwriter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Walt &amp; Louise Simonson|last=Sanderson|first=Peter|date=October 1986|work=[[Comics Interview]]|publisher=[[Fictioneer Books]]|issue=39|pages=62–63|authorlink=Peter Sanderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His teaching experiences were in the [http://www.chi.utoronto.ca/ McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology] at the [[University of Toronto]] and with the McLuhan Program International. He was Director of Media Studies at the Harris Institute for the Arts in Toronto for 17 years. Prior to that he taught and tutored at [[York University]], [[Dawson College]] and [[OCAD University|Ontario College of Art]]. Likewise, he was a founding partner at McLuhan and Davies Communications. He also performed the original [[Fordham Experiment]].

McLuhan was the author of ''Electric Language'' (1998), ''The Role of Thunder in Finnegans Wake'' (1997) and ''The Sensus Communis, Synesthesia, and the Soul: An Odyssey'' (2015). He was also editor of the journal ''McLuhan Studies'' and has overseen several collections of his father's work: ''The Book of Probes'' (2011), ''Marshall McLuhan Unbound'' (2005, with Terrence Gordon), ''The Medium and the Light'' (2010); and the co-editor of ''Essential McLuhan'' (1997, with Frank Zingrone).

Recent work included a collaboration with mime Wayne D. Constantineau, produced in a series called ''The Human Equation'' (BPS Books), which curiously included a board game. Also forthcoming is: ''The Dance of the Ages: Egyptian Art of the Old Kingdom and Its Relevance to the Twenty-First Century'', Cambridge Scholars Press.

He lived in Ontario, Canada, continuing in retirement to work on new books, projects &amp; collections, his father's works, his own and with collaborators.

He died in [[Bogotá]], a day after delivering the inaugural speech for the Doctorate in Communication at [[University of La Sabana]].&lt;ref name="mcluhangalaxy-eric"&gt;{{cite news|title=Remembering Eric McLuhan (1942–2018)|date=May 19, 2018|work=Mcluhan Galaxy|publisher=Mcluhan Galaxy|url=https://mcluhangalaxy.wordpress.com/2018/05/19/remembering-eric-mcluhan-1942-2018/|authorlink=Peter Sanderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Generative art''' refers to [[art]] that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the [[Generative systems|generative system]] represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator.

"Generative art" often refers to [[algorithmic art]] (algorithmically determined computer generated artwork), but artists can also make it using systems of [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mechanics]] and [[robotics]], [[smart materials]], manual [[randomization]], [[mathematics]], [[data mapping]], [[symmetry]], [[Tessellation|tiling]], and more.

== History ==

The use of the word "generative" in the discussion of art has developed over time. The use of "[[Artificial DNA]]" defines a generative approach to art focused on the construction of a system able to generate unpredictable events, all with a recognizable common character. The use of [[autonomous robot|autonomous systems]], required by some contemporary definitions, focuses a generative approach where the controls are strongly reduced. This approach is also named "emergent". [[Margaret Boden]] and Ernest Edmonds have noted the use of the term "generative art" in the broad context of automated computer graphics in the 1960s, beginning with artwork exhibited by [[Georg Nees]] and [[Frieder Nake]] in 1965:&lt;ref name="Boden"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boden, Margaret |author2=Edmonds, Ernest |author1link=Margaret Boden |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233128802_What_is_generative_art |title=What is Generative Art? |journal=Digital Creativity |date=2009 |volume=20 |issue=1/2 |pages=21–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 {{quotation | The  terms  "generative art"  and  "computer  art"  have been  used  in  tandem,  and  more  or  less interchangeably, since the very earliest days.&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt;}}

The first such exhibition showed the work of Nees in February 1965, which some claim was titled "Generative Computergrafik".&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; While Nees does not himself remember, this was the title of his doctoral thesis published a few years later.&lt;ref name=Nake12&gt;{{cite web |last=Nake |first=Frieder |title=Georg Nees: Generative Computergrafik |url=http://dada.compart-bremen.de/node/3280 |publisher=University of Bremen |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correct title of the first exhibition and catalog was "computer-grafik".&lt;ref&gt;Ness, Georg; Bense, Max: ''computer-grafik''; Edition Rot 19; Stuttgart, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; "Generative art" and related terms was in common use by several other early computer artists around this time, including [[Manfred Mohr]].&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; The term "Generative Art" with the meaning of dynamic artwork-systems able to generate multiple artwork-events was clearly used the first time for the "Generative Art" conference in Milan in 1998.

The term has also been used to describe geometric [[abstract art]] where simple elements are repeated, transformed, or varied to generate more complex forms. Thus defined, generative art was practised by the Argentinian artists Eduardo McEntyre and Miguel Ángel Vidal in the late 1960s. In 1972 the Romanian-born Paul Neagu created the Generative Art Group in Britain. It was populated exclusively by Neagu using aliases such as "Hunsy Belmood" and "Edward Larsocchi." In 1972 Neagu gave a lecture titled 'Generative Art Forms' at the [[Queen's University, Belfast]] Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Harold, ed. ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Art'', Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, J. A. ''Glossary of art, architecture, and design since 1945 (3rd ed.)'', London; Boston: Library Association Publishing; G.K. Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] created a department called "Generative Systems." As described by [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] the focus was on art practices using the then new technologies for the capture, inter-machine transfer, printing and transmission of images, as well as the exploration of the aspect of time in the transformation of image information.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Sonia Landy. ''Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas'', Leonardo, 16(2), 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Clauser &lt;ref&gt;Clauser, H. R. ''Towards a Dynamic, Generative Computer Art'', Leonardo, 21(2), 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; identified the aspect of systemic autonomy as a critical element in generative art:

 {{quotation | It should be evident from the above description of the evolution of generative art that process (or structuring) and change (or transformation) are among its most definitive features, and that these features and the very term 'generative' imply dynamic development and motion. ...

(the result) is not a creation by the artist but rather the product of the generative process - a self-precipitating structure. }}

In 1989 Celestino Soddu defined the Generative Design approach to Architecture and Town Design in his book ''Citta' Aleatorie''.&lt;ref&gt;Soddu, C.  Citta' Aleatorie, Masson Publisher 1989 "[http://www.artscience-ebookshop.com/cittaaleatorie_book.htm]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Franke referred to "generative mathematics" as "the study of mathematical operations suitable for generating artistic images."&lt;ref&gt;Franke, H. W.''Mathematics As an Artistic-Generative Principle'', Leonardo, Supplemental Issue, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1990s [[Brian Eno]] popularized the terms [[generative music]] and generative systems, making a connection with earlier [[experimental music]] by [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]] and [[Philip Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;Eno, B. ''[http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/eno1.html  Generative Music]'', In Motion Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of the 20th century, communities of generative artists, designers, musicians and theoreticians began to meet, forming cross-disciplinary perspectives.  
The first meeting about generative Art was in 1998, at the inaugural International Generative Art conference at Politecnico di Milano University, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Soddu, C. and Colabella, E. ed.s "[http://www.artscience-ebookshop.com/ga98_book.htm Generative Art]", Dedalo&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Australia, the Iterate conference on generative systems in the electronic arts followed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~iterate/FI/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  
On-line discussion has centred around the eu-gene mailing list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727083144/http://generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene |archivedate=2012-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which began late 1999, and has hosted much of the debate which has defined the field.&lt;ref name="Galanter2003" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  These activities have more recently been joined by the [http://www.generatorx.no/generatorx-introduction/ Generator.x] conference in Berlin starting in 2005.
In 2012 the new journal GASATHJ, Generative Art Science and Technology Hard Journal was founded by Celestino Soddu and Enrica Colabella &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasathj.com  GASATHJ]&lt;/ref&gt; jointing several generative artists and scientists in the Editorial Board.

Some have argued that as a result of this engagement across disciplinary boundaries, the community has converged on a shared meaning of the term.  As Boden and Edmonds&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; put it in 2011:

{{quotation | Today, the term "Generative Art" is still current within the relevant artistic community. Since 1998  a series  of  conferences  have been  held  in Milan with  that  title (Generativeart.com), and Brian Eno has been inﬂuential in promoting and using generative art methods (Eno, 1996). Both in music and in visual art, the use of the term has now converged on work that has been produced by the activation of a set of rules and where the artist lets a computer system take over at least some of the decision-making (although, of course, the artist determines the rules).}}

In the call of the Generative Art conferences in Milan (annually starting from 1998), the definition of Generative Art by Celestino Soddu:

{{quotation | Generative Art is the idea realized as genetic code of artificial events, as construction of dynamic complex systems able to generate endless variations. Each Generative Project is a concept-software that works producing unique and non-repeatable events, like music or 3D Objects, as possible and manifold expressions of the generating idea strongly recognizable as a vision belonging to an artist / designer / musician / architect /mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generativeart.com Generative Art]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Discussion on the eu-gene mailing list was framed by the following definition by [[Adrian Ward (artist)|Adrian Ward]] from 1999:

{{quotation | Generative art is a term given to work which stems from concentrating on the processes involved in producing an artwork, usually (although not strictly) automated by the use of a machine or computer, or by using mathematic or pragmatic instructions to define the rules by which such artworks are executed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000901084825/http://www.generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene eu-gene mailing list welcome page]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A similar definition is provided by Philip Galanter:&lt;ref name="Galanter2003" /&gt;
{{quotation | Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist creates a process, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is then set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.}}

==Types==

===Music===
{{Main article|Generative music}}
[[Johann Philipp Kirnberger]]'s "[[Musikalisches Würfelspiel]]" (Musical Dice Game) 1757 is considered an early example of a generative system based on randomness. Dice were used to select musical sequences from a numbered pool of previously composed phrases. This system provided a balance of order and disorder. The structure was based on an element of order on one hand, and disorder on the other.&lt;ref name="Algorithmic"&gt;Nierhaus, Gerhard (2009). ''Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation'', pp. 36 &amp; 38n7. {{ISBN|9783211755396}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fugues]] of [[J.S. Bach]] could be considered generative, in that there is a strict underlying process that is followed by the composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Tim|title=Fugue 9: E Major. Well-Tempered Clavier, book 1. The Fugue is Generative|url=http://bach.nau.edu/clavier/nature/fugues/Fugue09.html|publisher=NAU.edu|accessdate=28 November 2017|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[serialism]] follows strict procedures which, in some cases, can be set up to generate entire compositions with limited human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Lerdahl|Lerdahl, Fred]]. 1988.

Composers such as [[John Cage]],&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]] ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–15}} [[Farmers Manual]] and [[Brian Eno]]&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;{{rp|133}} have used [[generative systems]] in their works.

===Visual art===
The artist [[Ellsworth Kelly]] created paintings by using chance operations to assign colors in a grid. He also created works on paper that he then cut into strips or squares and reassembled using chance operations to determine placement.&lt;ref&gt;Yve-Alain Bois, Jack Cowart, Alfred Pacquement ''Ellsworth Kelly: The Years in France, 1948-1954'', Washington DC, National Gallery of Art, Prestel, p. 23-26&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists such as [[Hans Haacke]] have explored processes of physical and social systems in artistic context.  
[[François Morellet]] has used both highly ordered and highly disordered systems in his artwork.  Some of his paintings feature regular systems of radial or parallel lines to create [[Moiré Patterns]]. In other works he has used chance operations to determine the coloration of grids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue16/colourchart3.htm Tate Online Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325054818/http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue16/colourchart3.htm |date=2012-03-25 }} about [[François Morellet]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck "Francois Morellet, Austere Abtractionism", New York Times, Feb. 22, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sol LeWitt]] created generative art in the form of systems expressed in [[natural language]] and systems of geometric [[permutation]].

[[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] are video art pioneers who used analog video feedback to create generative art. Video feedback is now cited as an example of deterministic chaos, and the early explorations by the Vasulkas anticipated contemporary science by many years.
Software systems exploiting [[evolutionary computing]] to create visual form include those created by [[Scott Draves]] and [[Karl Sims]].
The digital artist [[Joseph Nechvatal]] has exploited models of viral contagion.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Wands ''Art of the Digital Age'', London: Thames &amp; Hudson, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Pierre Hebert]] and [[Roman Verostko]] are founding members of the [[Algorists]], a group of artists who create their own algorithms to create art.
[[Michael Noll|A. Michael Noll]], of Bell Telephone Laboratories, Incorporated, programmed computer art using mathematical equations and programmed randomness, starting in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;A. Michael Noll, “The Digital Computer as a Creative Medium,” IEEE Spectrum, Vol. 4, No. 10, (October 1967), pp. 89-95; and “Computers and the Visual Arts,” Design and Planning 2: Computers in Design and Communication (Edited by Martin Krampen and Peter Seitz), Hastings House, Publishers, Inc.: New York (1967), pp. 65-79.&lt;/ref&gt;
The French artist [[Jean-Max Albert]], beside environmental sculptures like ''Iapetus'',&lt;ref&gt;Michel Ragon, Jean-Max Albert «Iapetus», L’art abstrait vol.5, Éditions Maeght, Paris, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and ''O=C=O'',&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Max Albert O=C=O, Franco Torriani, Dalla Land arte alla bioarte, Hopefulmonster editore Torino, 2007, p. 64-70&lt;/ref&gt; developed a project dedicated to the vegetation itself, in terms of biological activity. The ''Calmoduline Monument'' project is based on the property of a protein, [[calmodulin]], to bond selectively to calcium. Exterior physical constraints (wind, rain, etc.) modify the electric potential of the cellular membranes of a plant and consequently the flux of calcium. However, the calcium controls the expression of the calmoduline gene.&lt;ref&gt;Intra-and Intercellular Communications in Plants, Millet &amp; Greppin Editors, INRA, Paris, 1980, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant can thus, when there is a stimulus, modify its « typical » growth pattern. So the basic principle of this monumental sculpture is that to the extent that they could be picked up and transported, these signals could be enlarged, translated into colors and shapes, and show the plant’s « decisions » suggesting a level of fundamental biological activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/L_espace_de_profil.html?id=PAlPAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Space in profile/ L'espace de profil,'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurizio Bolognini]] works with generative machines to address conceptual and social concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Bolognini, ''De l'interaction à la démocratie. Vers un art génératif post-digital''  ([http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm From interactivity to democracy.

[[Mark Napier (artist)|Mark Napier]] is a pioneer in data mapping, creating works based on the streams of zeros and ones in ethernet traffic, as part of the "Carnivore" project. [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]] pushed this theme further, transforming "data sets" as diverse as musical scores (in "Shape of Song", 2001) and Wikipedia edits ([[History Flow]], 2003, with [[Fernanda Viegas]]) into dramatic visual compositions.
The Canadian artist [[San Base]] developed a "Dynamic Painting" algorithm in 2002. Using computer algorithms as "brush strokes," Base creates sophisticated imagery that evolves over time to produce a fluid, never-repeating artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanbasestudio.com/about.htm San Base: About]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software art===
{{Main article|Software Art}}
For some artists, graphic user interfaces and computer code have become an independent art form in themselves. [[Adrian Ward (artist)|Adrian Ward]] created Auto-Illustrator as a commentary on software and generative methods applied to art and design.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Literature===
{{further information|Oulipo|The Eureka|Electronic literature|Spam Lit|Informationist poetry|Language game|Prehistoric Digital Poetry}}

Writers such as [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Brion Gysin]], and [[William Burroughs]] used the [[cut-up technique]] to introduce randomization to literature as a generative system. [[Jackson Mac Low]] produced computer-assisted poetry and used algorithms to generate texts; [[Philip M. Parker#Automatically generated books|Philip M. Parker]] has written software to automatically generate entire books. [[Jason Nelson]] used generative methods with Speech-to-Text software to create a series of digital poems from movies, television and other audio sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Flores |first1=Leonardo |title=The Battery Life of Meaning: Speech to Text Poetry” |url=http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=324 |website=I love E-Poetry |accessdate=9 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704155151/http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=324 |archivedate=4 July 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live coding===
{{Main article|Live coding}}
Generative systems may be modified while they operate, for example by using interactive programming environments such as [[Max/MSP]], [[vvvv]], [[Fluxus (programming environment)|Fluxus]], [[Isadora (software)|Isadora]], [[Quartz Composer]] and [[openFrameworks]]. This is a standard approach to programming by artists, but may also be used to create live music and/or video by manipulating generative systems on stage, a performance practice that has become known as [[live coding]]. As with many examples of [[software art]], because live coding emphasises human authorship rather than autonomy, it may be considered in opposition to generative art.&lt;ref name=McLean11&gt;{{cite book |last=McLean |first=Alex |title=Artist-Programmers and Programming Languages for the Arts |year=2011 |publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London (PhD Thesis)|pages=16–17 |url=http://yaxu.org/writing/thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Philip Galanter===

In the most widely cited theory of generative art, in 2003 Philip Galanter&lt;ref name="Galanter2003"&gt;Philip Galanter [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/ga2003_what_is_genart.pdf ''What is Generative Art? Complexity theory as a context for art theory''], 2003 International Conference on Generative Art&lt;/ref&gt; describes generative art systems in the context of complexity theory. In particular the notion of [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Seth Lloyd]]'s [[effective complexity]] is cited. In this view both highly ordered and highly disordered generative art can be viewed as simple. Highly ordered generative art minimizes [[entropy]] and allows maximal [[data compression]], and highly disordered generative art maximizes entropy and disallows significant data compression. Maximally complex generative art blends order and disorder in a manner similar to biological life, and indeed biologically inspired methods are most frequently used to create complex generative art. This view is at odds with the earlier [[information theory]] influenced views of [[Max Bense]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Bense|Bense, Max]] ''Aesthetica; Einfuehrung in die neue Aesthetik'', Agis-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abraham Moles]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Moles|Moles, Abraham]]. ''Information theory and esthetic perception'', University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt; where complexity in art increases with disorder.

Galanter notes further that given the use of visual symmetry, pattern, and repetition by the most ancient known cultures generative art is as old as art itself. He also addresses the mistaken equivalence by some that rule-based art is synonymous with generative art. For example, some art is based on constraint rules that disallow the use of certain colors or shapes. Such art is not generative because constraint rules are not constructive, i.e. by themselves they don't assert what is to be done, only what cannot be done.&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Philip. [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/vague_terrain_2006.pdf ''Generative art and rules-based art.''], Vague Terrain (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Margaret Boden and Ernest Edmonds===

In their 2009 article, [[Margaret Boden]] and Ernest Edmonds agree that generative art need not be restricted to that done using computers, and that some rule-based art is not generative. They develop a technical vocabulary that includes Ele-art (electronic art), C-art ([[computer art]]), D-art (digital art), CA-art (computer assisted art), G-art (generative art), CG-art (computer based generative art), Evo-art (evolutionary based art), R-art (robotic art), I-art (interactive art), CI-art (computer based interactive art), and VR-art (virtual reality art).&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt;
&lt;!--
In both accounts the term generative art does not describe an [[art movement]], [[ideology]], or theory of [[aesthetics]]. The term refers to how the art is made, and does not take into account why it was made or what the content of the artwork is.--&gt;&lt;!--this is WP:OR, an editor's opinion--&gt;

=== Questions ===

The discourse around generative art can be characterised by the theoretical questions which motivate its development. McCormack et al. propose the following questions, shown with paraphrased summaries, as the most important:&lt;ref name=McC&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCormack |first=Jon |author2=Oliver Bown |author3=Alan Dorin |author4=Jonathan McCabe |author5=Gordon Monro |author6=Mitchell Whitelaw |title=Ten Questions Concerning Generative Computer Art |journal=Leonardo |year=forthcoming |url=http://diotima.infotech.monash.edu.au/~jonmc/sa/news/ten-questions-concerning-generative-computer-art/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121129225520/http://diotima.infotech.monash.edu.au/~jonmc/sa/news/ten-questions-concerning-generative-computer-art/ |archivedate=2012-11-29 |date=2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Can a machine originate anything?  ''Related to [[machine intelligence]] - can a machine generate something new, meaningful, surprising and of value: a poem, an artwork, a useful idea, a solution to a long-standing problem?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What is it like to be a computer that makes art?  ''If a computer could originate art, what would it be like from the computer's perspective?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# Can human aesthetics be formalised?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What new kinds of art does the computer enable?  ''Many generative artworks do not involve digital computers, but what does generative computer art bring that is new?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# In what sense is generative art representational, and what is it representing?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What is the role of randomness in generative art? ''For example, what does the use of randomness say about the place of intentionality in the making of art?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What can computational generative art tell us about creativity? ''How could generative art give rise to artefacts and ideas that are new, surprising and valuable?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What characterises good generative art? ''How can we form a more critical understanding of generative art?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What can we learn about art from generative art? ''For example, can the art world be considered a complex generative system involving many processes outside the direct control of artists, who are agents of production within a stratified global art market.''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What future developments would force us to rethink our answers?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;

Another question is of postmodernism—are generative art systems the ultimate expression of the postmodern condition, or do they point to a new synthesis based on a complexity-inspired world-view?&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Philip.

'''Genetic erosion''' (also known as '''genetic depletion''') is a process where the limited [[gene pool]] of an [[endangered species]] diminishes even more when reproductive individuals die off before reproducing [[Small population size|low population]]. The term is sometimes used in a narrow sense, such as when describing the loss of particular [[allele]]s or genes, as well as being used more broadly, as when referring to the loss of a phenotype or whole species.

Genetic erosion occurs because each individual organism has many unique genes which get lost when it dies without getting a chance to breed. Low genetic diversity in a population of wild animals and plants leads to a further diminishing gene pool&amp;nbsp;– inbreeding and a weakening immune system can then "fast-track" that species towards eventual [[extinction]].

By definition, endangered species suffer varying degrees of genetic erosion. Many species benefit from a human-assisted breeding program to keep their population viable,{{cn|date=December 2016}} thereby avoiding extinction over long time-frames. Small populations are more susceptible to genetic erosion than larger populations. 

Genetic erosion gets compounded and accelerated by habitat loss and [[habitat fragmentation]]&amp;nbsp;– many endangered species are threatened by habitat loss and (fragmentation) [[habitat]]. Fragmented habitat create barriers in gene flow between populations. 

The [[gene pool]] of a [[species]] or a [[population]] is the complete set of unique alleles that would be found by inspecting the genetic material of every living member of that species or population. A large gene pool indicates extensive [[genetic diversity]], which is associated with robust populations that can survive bouts of intense [[Selection (biology)|selection]]. Meanwhile, low genetic diversity (see [[inbreeding]] and [[population bottleneck]]s) can cause reduced [[fitness (biology)|biological fitness]] and increase the chance of [[extinction]] of that species or population.

==Processes and consequences==
Population bottlenecks create shrinking gene pools, which leave fewer and fewer fertile mating partners. The genetic implications can be illustrated by considering the analogy of a high-stakes poker game with a crooked dealer. Consider that the game begins with a 52-card deck (representing high genetic diversity). Reduction of the number of breeding pairs with unique genes resembles the situation where the dealer deals only the same five cards over and over, producing only a few limited "hands".

As specimens begin to inbreed, both physical and reproductive congenital effects and defects appear more often. Abnormal sperm increases, infertility rises, and birthrates decline. "Most perilous are the effects on the immune defense systems, which become weakened and less and less able to fight off an increasing number of bacterial, viral, fungal, parasitic, and other disease-producing threats. Thus, even if an endangered species in a bottleneck can withstand whatever human development may be eating away at its habitat, it still faces the threat of an epidemic that could be fatal to the entire population."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://lynx.uio.no/jon/lynx/obrien-e.htm |quote=A population bottleneck creates a shrinking gene pool that leaves fewer and fewer mating partners. What are the genetic implications? The animals become part of a high stakes poker game&amp;nbsp;– with a crooked dealer. After beginning with a 52-card deck, the players wind up with, say, five cards that they are dealt over and over. As they begin to inbreed, congenital effects appear, both physical and reproductive. Often abnormal sperm increase; infertility rises; the birthrate falls. Most perilous in the long run, each animal's immune defense system is weakened. Thus, even if an endangered species in a bottleneck can withstand whatever human development may be eating away at its habitat, it still faces the threat of an epidemic that could well be fatal to the entire population. |title=GENETIC EROSION ''A Global Dilemma'' |author=Stephen J.

==Loss of agricultural and livestock biodiversity==
{{See also|Agricultural biodiversity}}
Genetic erosion in [[agricultural]] and [[livestock]] is the loss of biological genetic diversity&amp;nbsp;– including the loss of individual genes, and the loss of particular [[Genetic recombination|recombinants]] of genes (or gene complexes)&amp;nbsp;– such as those manifested in locally adapted [[landraces]] of [[domesticated]] animals or plants that have become adapted to the natural environment in which they originated.

The major driving forces behind genetic erosion in crops are variety replacement, land clearing, [[overexploitation]] of species, population pressure, [[environmental degradation]], [[overgrazing]], governmental policy, and changing agricultural systems. The main factor, however, is the replacement of local varieties of domestic plants and animals by other varieties or species that are non-local. A large number of varieties can also often be dramatically reduced when commercial varieties are introduced into traditional farming systems. Many researchers believe that the main problem related to agro-ecosystem management is the general tendency towards genetic and ecological uniformity imposed by the development of modern agriculture.

==Prevention by human intervention, modern science and safeguards==

===''In situ'' conservation===
With advances in modern bioscience, several techniques and safeguards have emerged to check the relentless advance of genetic erosion and the resulting acceleration of endangered species towards eventual extinction. However, many of these techniques and safeguards are too expensive yet to be practical, and so the best way to protect species is to protect their [[habitat]] and to let them live in it as naturally as possible.

[[Wildlife sanctuaries]] and [[national park]]s have been created to preserve entire [[ecosystem]]s with all the web of species native to the area. [[Wildlife corridor]]s are created to join fragmented habitats (see [[Habitat fragmentation]]) to enable endangered species to travel, meet, and breed with others of their kind. Scientific [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] and modern [[wildlife management]] techniques, with the expertise of scientifically trained staff, help manage these protected ecosystems and the wildlife found in them. Wild animals are also [[Species translocation|translocated]] and [[Species reintroduction|reintroduced]] to other locations physically when fragmented wildlife habitats are too far and isolated to be able to link together via a wildlife corridor, or when local extinctions have already occurred.

===''Ex situ'' conservation===
Modern policies of [[zoo associations]] and [[zoo]]s around the world have begun putting dramatically increased emphasis on keeping and breeding wild-sourced [[species]] and [[subspecies]] of animals in their registered endangered species breeding programs. These specimens are intended to have a chance to be reintroduced and survive back in the wild. The main objectives of zoos today have changed, and greater resources are being invested in breeding species and subspecies for then ultimate purpose of assisting conservation efforts in the wild. Zoos do this by maintaining extremely detailed scientific breeding records (''i.e.'' [[studbook]]s)) and by loaning their wild animals to other zoos around the country (and often globally) for breeding, to safeguard against [[inbreeding]] by attempting to maximize genetic diversity however possible.

Costly (and sometimes controversial) [[ex-situ conservation]] techniques aim to increase the genetic [[biodiversity]] on our planet, as well as the diversity in local [[gene pool]]s. by guarding against genetic erosion. Modern concepts like [[seedbank]]s, [[sperm bank]]s, and [[tissue bank]]s have become much more commonplace and valuable. [[Sperm]], [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], and [[embryos]] can now be frozen and kept in banks, which are sometimes called "Modern Noah's Arks" or "[[Frozen Zoo]]s". [[Cryopreservation]] techniques are used to freeze these living materials and keep them alive in perpetuity by storing them submerged in [[liquid nitrogen]] tanks at very low temperatures. Thus, preserved materials can then be used for [[artificial insemination]], [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]], [[embryo transfer]], and [[cloning]] methodologies to protect diversity in the gene pool of critically endangered species.

It can be possible to save an [[endangered species]] from [[extinction]] by preserving only ''parts'' of specimens, such as tissues, sperm, eggs, etc.&amp;nbsp;– even after the death of a critically endangered animal, or collected from one found freshly dead, in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]] or from the [[Wilderness|wild]]. A new specimen can then be "resurrected" with the help of cloning, so as to give it another chance to breed its genes into the living population of the respective threatened species. Resurrection of dead critically endangered wildlife specimens with the help of cloning is still being perfected, and is still too expensive to be practical, but with time and further advancements in science and methodology it may well become a routine procedure not to far into the future.

Recently, strategies for finding an integrated approach to ''in situ'' and ''ex situ'' conservation techniques have been given considerable attention, and progress is being made.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.diverseeds.eu/forum/viewforum.php?f=14 DIVERSEEDS online discussion]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} forum on the integrated approach.{{deadlink|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Haniwa'' were created according to the ''wazumi'' technique, in which mounds of coiled clay were built up to shape the figure, layer by layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nussbaum, Louis Frédéric|author-link=Louis Frédéric|title=Le Japon: Dictionnaire et Civilisation|trans-title=Japan Encyclopedia|year=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press Reference Library|location=United States of America|isbn=9780674017535|pages=286, 833|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;lpg=PA831&amp;ots=gYPzqwajn0&amp;dq=wasumi%20technique&amp;pg=PA286#v=onepage&amp;q=wasumi%20technique&amp;f=false|translator=Käthe Roth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Haniwa'' were made with water-based clay and dried into a coarse and absorbent material that stood the test of time. Their name means “circle of clay” referring to how they were arranged in a circle above the tomb. The protruding parts of the figures were made separately and then attached, while a few things were carved into them. They were smoothed out by a wooden paddle. Terraces were arranged to place them with a cylindrical base into the ground, where the earth would hold them in place.

During the Kofun period, a highly aristocratic society with militaristic rulers developed. The [[cavalry]] wore iron armor, carried [[sword]]s and other weapons, and used advanced military methods like those of northeast Asia. Many of them are represented in ''haniwa'' figurines for funerary purposes.

The most important of the ''haniwa'' were found in southern [[Honshū]]—especially the [[Kansai|Kinai region]] around [[Nara prefecture|Nara]]—and northern [[Kyūshū]]. ''Haniwa'' grave offerings were made in many forms, such as horses, chickens, birds, fans, fish, houses, weapons, shields, sunshades, pillows, and humans. Besides decorative and spiritual reasons of protecting the deceased in his afterlife, these figures served as a sort of retaining wall for the [[Tumulus|burial mound]].

Because these ''haniwa'' display the contemporary clothing, hairstyle, farming tools, and architecture, these sculptures are important as a historical archive of the Kofun Period.

Everyday pottery items from that period are called [[Haji pottery]].

== History ==
=== Origin ===
Earlier clay figurines appeared during the [[Jōmon period]] called ''[[dogū]]''.

[[Hiroaki Sato (translator)|Hiroaki Sato]] cites a passage from the [[Nihon Shoki]], in which [[Emperor Suinin]] issued an imperial edict concerning funerals: "From now on make it a rule to erect clay figures and not to hurt people."  Thus, these clay figures may have replaced live human sacrifices.&lt;ref name=Sato&gt;{{Cite book |last=Sato |first=Hiroaki |title=Legends of the Samurai |publisher=Overlook Duckworth |year=1995 |ISBN=9781590207307 |pages=68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of ''haniwa'' started during the latter part of the [[Yayoi period]] around the [[Kingdom of Kibi]]. During this time special earthenware figurines and bowls started to appear on top of the tombs of leaders. The early sculptures exceeded 1m (3.3ft) in length. They consisted of a cylindrical portion, which represented the torso, and a skirt-shaped portion at the base, which represented the legs. Many times a special insignia or pattern would be displayed on the torso. Sometimes an obi would be placed around the torso. These sculptures are thought to have been used as part of a funeral ritual. Other than the Kibi area, the only other place these sculptures were found was in the [[Izumo province]].

During the latter part of the 3rd century AD, these sculptures started to appear on top of the imperial [[Tumulus|grave mounds]] in the [[Kansai|Kinai region]]. During this time more elaborate ''haniwa'' appeared with earthenware bowls. It is believed that the movement of these sculptures and ''haniwa'' from the Kibi region to the [[Kansai|Kinai region]] is indicative of an increase in their importance.

===Later developments===
During the earlier part of the [[Kofun period]] (later 3rd century AD) the only earthenware ''haniwa'' were cylindrical; however, toward the early 4th century AD, shield and other tool-shaped ''haniwa'' started to appear. Additionally, during the middle [[Kofun period]] (mid-5th century AD) [[Miko|shrine maiden]], horse, dog, and other animal-shaped ''haniwa'' were introduced. As the practice of ceremonial [[Tumulus|burial mounds]] declined in the mid-6th century AD, ''haniwa'' became rarer in the [[Kansai|Kinai region]]; however, ''haniwa'' were made in abundance in the [[Kantō region]].

It is not uncommon for some haniwa to be painted with red dye or other colors. Besides the cylindrical haniwa (enkei-haniwa), another common type was the house-shaped haniwa (keisho-haniwa). Other things that fell into the category of keisho-haniwa were those shaped like humans, animals, and swords. The details on the haniwa give information about the elite buried in the tomb, as well as valuable knowledge of the tools or other objects people of that time used. The military haniwa inform archeologists of the armour and weapons, as well as the status symbols of these military branches.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Significance ==
Originally, the cylindrical type ''haniwa'' were set on top of the [[Tumulus|funeral mounds]], so it is believed that they had a purpose in funeral rituals; however, as the ''haniwa'' became more developed, they were set toward the outside of the grave area. It is thought that they were used as boundary markers for the borders of the gravesite.

There is a theory that the soul of the deceased would reside in the ''haniwa'', as the earlier ''haniwa'' were placed on top of the [[Tumulus|funeral mounds]]. There are ''haniwa'' that are equipped with weapons and armor. These are thought to be containers for souls. The armor and weapons would drive away evil spirits and protect the buried ruler from calamity.{{fact|date=January 2017}} Because the horse- and animal-shaped ''haniwa'' were normally neatly arranged into a line, it is believed that they were part of a sending-off ceremony.

==In modern society==
Although the religious implications of the ''haniwa'' have largely declined in modern society, the sculptures are prized by many for their aesthetic and historical significance. The works of Shojiro Ishibashi, for example, were heavily influenced by the ''haniwa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=The Ceramic Sculpture of Isamu Noguchi|last=Altshuler|first=Bruce |title=Isamu Noguchi to Kitaōji Rosanjin [Isamu Noguchi, Rosanjin Kitaōji] | language=ja | editor1=Saison Museum | editor2=Bijutsukan Renraku Kyōgikai | editor3=[[Museum of Modern Art, Kamakura &amp; Hayama]] in [[Kamakura]] |editor4= Fukuyama Museum of Art, [[Fukuyama, Hiroshima]] | publisher=[[Yomiuri Shinbun]]|translator = Ogawa, Kikuko | oclc=35856363 |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted from an exhibition catalog for an art show toured to four museums in Japan in 1996. {{cite web|url=http://www.noguchi.org/baceramic.html|title=The Ceramic Sculpture of Isamu Noguchi|last=Altshuler|first=Bruce|publisher=[[Noguchi Museum]]|archive-date=2005-07-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050720081323/http://www.noguchi.org/baceramic.html|access-date=2017-10-04|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been accepted as "Pure Art", according to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,868674,00.html | title= Art: The Haniwa Rage | date= 21 July 1958| work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | access-date= 4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond simple appreciation as artistic sculptures, modern popular culture has, in some cases, portrayed the ''haniwa'' as containing a sentient entity and not just as a simple empty sculpture. The most common portrayal depicts the ''haniwa'' with a rounded, pot-like shape, bearing two deep eyes, a wide mouth, and two featureless "arms" on opposite sides of the "pot".

The portrayal of living ''haniwa'' has—since the late 1990s—become widespread, being featured in trading cards, [[video games]] such as the ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' and [[Kirby (series)|''Kirby'']] series; and television. In many of the depictions, the ''haniwa'' is primarily presented as a ghostlike, malevolent creature; without attempting to retain the historical aspect of the ''haniwa'''s religious nature.
In ''[[Animal Crossing]]'', haniwas are called gyroids and are furniture only found buried in the ground.

'''Hans Jonas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|oʊ|n|æ|s}}; {{IPA-de|ˈjoːnas|lang}}; 10 May 1903&amp;nbsp;– 5 February 1993) was a [[Germany|German]]-born American Jewish philosopher, from 1955 to 1976 the Alvin Johnson Professor of Philosophy at the [[New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]].

==Biography==
[[Image:Hans Jonas' birth house in Moenchengladbach.JPG|thumb|Birth house of Hans Jonas in Mönchengladbach.]]
[[Image:Moenchengladbach Stolpersteine Mozartstrasse.jpg|thumb|In front of the house, two [[Stolpersteine]] were installed in 2008. The left one commemorates the philosopher's mother Rosa Jonas, murdered in Auschwitz in 1942.]]

Jonas was born in [[Mönchengladbach]], on 10 May 1903. He studied [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at the [[University of Freiburg]], the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]], and finally earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in 1928 from the [[University of Marburg]]&lt;ref name="W"&gt;H. Jonas, "''Wissenschaft'' as Personal Experience," ''The Hastings Center report'' 32:4 (Jul–Aug 2002), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; with a thesis on [[Gnosticism]] entitled ''Der Begriff der Gnosis'' (''The Concept of [[Gnosis]]'') and directed by [[Martin Heidegger]].&lt;ref&gt;Wellistony C. Viana, ''Das Prinzip Verantwortung von Hans Jonas aus der Perspektive des objektiven Idealismus der Intersubjektivität von Vittorio Hösle'', Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2010, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; During his study years his academic advisors included [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Rudolf Bultmann]].&lt;ref name="W"/&gt; In Marburg he met [[Hannah Arendt]], who was also pursuing her PhD there, and the two of them were to remain friends for the rest of their lives.

Heidegger joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933, which may have disturbed Jonas, as he was Jewish and an active [[Zionist]].  Certainly, in 1964 Jonas would repudiate his mentor Heidegger, for his affiliation with the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/06/nyregion/hans-jonas-influential-philosopher-is-dead-at-89.html Hans Jonas, Influential Philosopher, Is Dead at 89], [[The New York Times]], Eric Pace, 6 February 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
He left Germany for [[England]] in 1933, and from England he moved to Palestine in 1934. There he met [[Lore Weiner]], to whom he became betrothed. In 1940 he returned to Europe to join the [[British Army]] which had been arranging a special brigade for German Jews wanting to fight against [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] (See ''[[Jewish Brigade|The Jewish Brigade]]''). He was sent to [[Italy]], and in the last phase of the war moved into Germany. Thus, he kept his promise that he would return only as a soldier in the victorious army. In this time he wrote several letters to Lore about philosophy, in particular philosophy of biology, that would form the basis of his later publications on the subject. They finally married in 1943.

Immediately after the war he returned to Mönchengladbach to search for his mother but found that she had been sent to the gas chambers in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Having heard this, he refused to live in Germany again. He returned to Palestine and took part in Israel's [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|war of independence]] in 1948. Jonas taught briefly at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] before moving to North America. In 1950 he left for [[Canada]], teaching at [[Carleton University]]. From there he moved in 1955 to [[New York City]], where he was to live for the rest of his life. He was a fellow of the Hastings Center and Professor of Philosophy at [[New School for Social Research]] from 1955 to 1976 (where he was Alvin Johnson Professor). From 1982 to 1983 Jonas held the [[Eric Voegelin]] Visiting Professorship at the [[University of Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rEu61KIK6FYC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=voegelin+hans+jonas&amp;source=web&amp;ots=zU6iNo95S3&amp;sig=URhgwghOXKgP8Hbo0pK0H5LAo-I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA168,M1 ''The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin: Selected Correspondence, 1950-1984''], University of Missouri Press, 2007, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; He died at his home in New Rochelle, New York, on 5 February 1993, aged 89.&lt;ref&gt;

==Works==

Jonas's writings were very influential in different spheres. For example, ''The Gnostic Religion'', based on his early research on the Gnosis and first published in 1958, was for many years the standard work in English on the subject of [[Gnosticism]]. ''The Imperative of Responsibility'' ([[German language|German]] 1979, [[English language|English]] 1984) centers on social and ethical problems created by [[technology]]. Jonas insists that human survival depends on our efforts to care for our planet and its future. He formulated a new and distinctive supreme principle of morality: "Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life".

While ''The Imperative of Responsibility'' has been credited with catalyzing the environmental movement in Germany, his work ''The Phenomenon of Life'' (1966) forms the philosophical undergirding of one major school of [[bioethics]] in America. [[Murray Bookchin]] and [[Leon Kass]] both referred to Hans Jonas's work as major, or primary, inspiration. Heavily influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]], ''The Phenomenon of Life'' attempts to synthesize the philosophy of matter with the philosophy of mind, producing a rich existential understanding of biology, which ultimately argues for a simultaneously material and moral human nature.

His writing on the history of [[Gnosticism]] revisits terrain covered by earlier standard works on the subject such as [[Ernesto Buonaiuti]]'s ''Lo gnosticismo: storia di antiche lotte religiose'' (1907), interpreting the religion from an [[existentialism|existentialist]] philosophical viewpoint. He was one of the first philosophers to concern himself with ethical questions in biological science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3005">'''Herbert Martin James Loewe''' (1882–1940) was a noted scholar of Semitic languages and Jewish culture. His grandfather, [[Louis Loewe]] (1809–1880),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurrein.com/louis%20loewe.htm Jewish Encyclopedia, Edition 1903: Dr Louis LOEWE]&lt;/ref&gt; had been Sir [[Moses Montefiore]]’s secretary and the first Principal of the [[Judith Montefiore|Judith, Lady Montefiore]] College at [[Ramsgate]].

==Biography==
Loewe was a graduate of [[Queens' College, Cambridge]].  He was Chief English Master at the Schools of the Alliance at Cairo and Abyassiyyeh, Egypt, and the author of ''Kitab el Ansab of Samani''. Loewe was a lecturer in Semitic languages at [[Exeter College, Oxford]], from 1913 until 1931 when he accepted an academic position at Cambridge. Just before he left Oxford, he was responsible for the installation of three tablets in honour of Oxford Jewish heritage. The tablets celebrate the Centenary of the birth of Neubauer, who was a noted Jewish librarian in the [[Bodleian Library|Bodleian]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jtrails.org.uk/trails/oxford/profiles/c-302/herbert-loewe&lt;/ref&gt; Loewe was Curator of Oriental Literature, University LIbrary, Cambridge, and Reader in Rabbinics, Cambridge, from 1931 to his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hebrew Manuscripts at Cambridge University Library|author1=Reif, Stefan C. |author2=Reif, Shulamit |year=1997|page=33|isbn=0-521-58339-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0-521-58339-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1939-1940 Loewe was president of the [[Society for Old Testament Study]].

Loewe's first son, Raphael Loewe (1919&amp;ndash;2011) was a scholar of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and a professor at [[University College London]], while his second son [[Michael Loewe]] is a noted scholar of [[Chinese language|Chinese]] who taught at [[Cambridge University]].

==Loewe Collection==
The [[Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies]] has in its library a collection of approximately 5,000 items collected by Herbert Loewe and his elder son Raphael Loewe (b. 1919, d. 27 May 2011), professor of Hebrew at University College London. The collection contains correspondence, offprints, unpublished typescripts of translations of Hebrew poetry, and a wide variety of printed matter related to Jewish studies in late antiquity and medieval times, as well as modern Anglo-Jewish history. There are a few items connected with Louis Loewe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/loewe.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315100643/http://www.ochjs.ac.uk/mullerlibrary/collections/loewe.html |archivedate=2012-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2879">The '''IAS 11''' standard of [[International Accounting Standards]] set out requirements for the accounting treatment of the [[revenue]] and [[cost]]s associated with long-term [[construction contract]]s. By their nature, construction activities and contracts are long-term projects, often beginning and ending in different [[accounting period]]s. Until its replacement with [[IFRS 15]] in January 2018, IAS 11 helped accountants with measuring to what extent costs, revenue and possible profit or loss on the project are incurred in each period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifrs.org/Documents/IAS11.pdf|title=IAS 11 Technical summary|last=|first=|date=2012|website=ifrs.org|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
How accounting revenue and costs are to be [[Revenue recognition|recognized]] depends first on whether the stage of completion of a project can be reliably measured. If this is the case, cost and revenue (including profit if any) can be recognized up to the percentage of completion during the current accounting period. If the stage of completion of a project cannot be reliably measured, the revenue can only be recognized up to the costs that have been incurred and any profit is only recognized at the end of the last accounting period. In the case a company is expecting to make a loss on the contract, this loss will be immediately recognized in the current accounting period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/accounting/docs/consolidated/ias11_en.pdf|title=International Accounting Standard 11 Construction Contracts|last=|first=|date=|website=Europa.eu|publisher=European Union|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Agriculture}}
The Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research (IISR) owes its origin to the recommendations of the erstwhile ''The'' ''Indian Central Sugarcane Committee'' for advanced research on all aspects of sugarcane cultivation except breeding and coordination of sugarcane researches across the country. The foundation stone of the institute was laid on 16 February 1952&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12355-009-0001-0# Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research, Lucknow: Envisioning improved sugarcane production technology for high yields and high sugar recovery in India - Springer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  under the administrative control of the Indian Central Sugarcane Committee. It was brought directly under the [[Government of India]] on 1 January 1954&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBjxRJ6VIvM Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research Lucknow at a glance - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and later on it was entrusted to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) on 1 April 1969 along with other agriculture based research institutions.

The Institute is an ISO 9001 accredited agency and has three regional stations for nationwide coverage of its activities.

'''IISR Regional Centre, [[Motipur, India|Motipur]], [[Muzaffarpur]], [[Bihar]]''':&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.icar.org.in/en/node/7121 Regional Centre, Motipur, Muzaffarpur (Bihar) of Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research celebrated Silver jubilee | Indian Council of Agricultural Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was the research station of the ''Sugarcane Breeding Institute'', [[Coimbatore]] when it was established in 1988 but was brought under IISR on 25 April 2004. The Centre focuses its attention on the development of sugarcane varieties, evaluation of waterlogging tolerance, [[red rot]] resistance and mechanization of sugarcane cultivation.

The Centre has developed several varieties of sugarcane for distribution and is involved in breeder seed development of improved varieties.

'''Sugarbeet Research and Development at the Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research, Lucknow''': This Institute is also specialized for [[sugarbeet]], which has wide tolerance levels and is cultivable for extended seasons. IISR has developed various agrotechniques for tropical and subtropical cultivation of sugarbeet, developed mechanized methods of sowing, crop raising and harvesting and standardised seed production technology. The centre also maintains training facilities on maintenance of germplasm, seed production, root crop production, plant protection and region-specific mechanization.

IISR has a Biological Control Centre,  at Pravaranagar in [[Maharashtra]].

===Division of Crop Improvement===

The Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research hosted a ''Botany and Breeding Unit'' for Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore during the sixties and, in 1969, the unit was transferred to IISR. In 1989, the unit was renamed the Division of Crop Improvement.

The Division focusses its attention on advanced research on sugar crops such as [[sugarcane]] and [[sugarbeet]] and has been successful in developing many improved varieties such as CoLk 8001, CoLk 8102, CoLk 94184 and CoLk 9709, which are known to have high cane yield, sugar content, [[red rot]] and top borer resistance and better water logging tolerance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; It also produces breeder seed and is also a DUS testing centre of sugarcane.

'''Mandate''': The Division has a set mandate to develop superior sugarcane varieties and breeding and genetic stocks, prescription of biotechnological techniques and documentation and evaluation sugarcane [[germplasm]].

'''Facilities''': The Division is equipped with a [[Molecular Biology]] and [[Biotechnology]] Lab, a [[Cytogenetics]] Lab, a DUS Testing Facility, a Glass house and a Poly house.

===Division of Crop Production===

Division of Crop Production, an original division since the inception of IISR 1952, is involved in developing modern technology for sugarcane production in the sub tropical regions. Efforts are on to marry [[agronomy]], [[soil science]] and [[microbiology]] for improving sugarcane processing including [[Jaggery|gur]] and [[jaggery]] production.

Major achievements of the Division include ring-pit method of sugarcane planting, skip-furrow method of irrigation, nutrient, water and weed management package in sugarcane production. It looks after the disciplines of Agronomy, Soil Science and [[Agricultural Chemistry]], Agricultural Microbiology and Extension and Training.

The Institute had four sections, ''[[Agronomy]]'', ''Sugarcane [[Mycology]]'', ''Sugarcane [[Entomology]]'' and ''[[Agricultural Engineering]]'', when it started in 1952. Four years later, two more sections, ''[[Soil Science]] and [[Agricultural Chemistry]]'' and ''[[Plant Physiology]]'', were added. One more section, ''Botany and Breeding'' came into existence in 1969. In 2001, two exiting divisions ''Plant Pathology and Entomology'' were merged to form the Division of Crop Protection.

The Basic objective of the Division is to conduct advanced research on diseases and pest management of sugarcane and other sugar crops. The Division concentrates on areas such as [[Plant Pathology]] with special emphasis on [[Colletotrichum falcatum]], techniques for inducing resistance for sugarcane, use of bio-agents against crop diseases such as ''yellow leaf virus disease'', pragmatic use of chemicals in disease management, variable analysis of [[pathogens]] such as [[Smut (fungus)|Smut]], GSD, ''Mosaic'', sugarcane borers, [[termite]] and [[white grub]], Entomology and introducing [[parasitoids]] in sugarcane agro-ecosystem to combat pests.

Coordinated research activity started in India in 1929 when the then Imperial Council of Agricultural Research, forerunner of the present [[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]], recommended study on sugarcane and sugar industry. In 1971, ICAR set up an All India Coordinated Project for Research (AICRP) on sugarcane with IISR as the base.

Efforts at the ''All India Coordinated Project for Research on sugarcane'' is dedicated to the sugarcane cultivation in different parts of the country where the agro-climatic conditions differ from region to region. The project provides a strong infrastructure for the research activities through its various research centres at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research institutes, State Agricultural universities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/Chandra-Shekhar-Azad-University-signs-MoU-with-Indian-Institute-of-Sugarcane-Research/articleshow/12738109.cms Chandra Shekhar Azad University signs MoU with Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research - The Times of India&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mewaruniversity.org/uploads/files/IISR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; State Departments of Agriculture&lt;ref&gt;[http://upcsr.org/CouncilS_Research_1.htm Welcome To - UPCSR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Non Government Organizations]], spread all over the country.

In 1995, IISR started an ''Agriculture Research Information System'' section under the National Agricultural Technology Project for augmenting the communication facilities of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://agropedia.iitk.ac.in/content/national-agriculture-technology-project-natp National Agriculture Technology Project (NATP) | agropedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the section was renamed as ''Agricultural Knowledge Management Unit''.

Over the years, the section equipped the Institute with modern computing and communication infrastructure consisting of a network of 200 nodes and 120 computers, a Local Area Network based on optical fibre cabling, a series of servers such as Web Server, Mail Exchange, Internet Proxy and Application Server, 100 Mbit/s leased line and connectivity with National Knowledge Network project of Government of India, as a nodal centre.

AKMU is active in the research on designing and sampling sugarcane experiments, performance, production constraints and price policies of sugarcane cropping, statistical support to the scientists, in-house development of required computer software, network and system administration, MIS, gathering market intelligence and other activities related to the dynamics of sugarcane and sugar production.

==Krishi Vigyan Kendra==
The Krishi Vigyan Kendra is an ICAR initiative&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icar.org.in/en/krishi-vigyan-kendra.htm Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) | Indian Council of Agricultural Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; for efforts to assist the farming community for the betterment of agricultural production and overall socio economic development of the community. Several KVK centres are functioning with their bases at various ICAR institutes and the KVK in IISR was established in 1999. The centre was formed with an aim to serve the farming community by delivering demand driven services with the assistance of qualified professionals. It was set with a mandate to assess, refine, demonstrate and introduce modern technologies and products to the farming community.

      <comment>Amend 'preference' (which may be arbitrary) for 'discretion' (which in English is the term usually used for an exercise in principled legal judgment).</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6026">{{Usul al-fiqh}}
'''''{{transl|ar|DIN|Istiḥsan}}''''' ([[Arabic]]: {{wikt-lang|ar|اِسْتِحْسَان}}) is an Arabic term for juristic discretion. In its literal sense it means "to consider something good". [[Muslim]] scholars may use it to express their preference for particular judgements in  [[Sharia|Islamic law]] over other possibilities. It is one of the principles of legal thought underlying scholarly interpretation or [[ijtihad]].

A number of disputes existed amongst the classical jurists over this principle with the Hanafite jurists adopting this as a secondary source. Contemporary proponents of [[liberal movements within Islam]] have used ''istihsan'' and the similar idea of ''[[istislah]]'' (Arabic for "to deem proper") as ethical principles to favour feminist and reformist interpretations of the [[Qur'an]] and [[Sunnah]], thus looking to reform [[Sharia|Islamic law]].

==Etymology==
''{{transl|ar|DIN|Istiḥsan}}'' ({{lang|ar|استحسان}} {{IPA-ar|istiħsaːn|}}) is an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word derived from the word ''al-husn'' ({{lang|ar|الحسن}}) which means good which is the opposite meaning of ''al-qubh'' ({{lang|ar|القبح}}) which means bad. The word ''{{transl|ar|DIN|istiḥsan}}'' is used to express "decorating or improving or considering something good".&lt;ref&gt;Mohd Hafiz Jamaludin and Ahmad Hidayat Buang "[http://www.dakwah.unisnu.ac.id/asset/webadmin/js/kcfinder/upload/files/Vol%201,%20No%201%20(2013)%20International%20Journal%20Of%20Nusantara%20Islam.pdf Syariah Courts in Malaysia and the Development of Islamic Jurisprudence: The Study of Istihsan]" International Journal of Nusantara Islam 1, no. 1 (2014): 2.{{ISSN|2252-5904}}. {{DOI| 10.15575/ijni.v1i1.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also applies to mean something towards which one is inclined or which one prefers, even if it is not approved by others.&lt;ref&gt;Nyazee, Islamic Jurisprudence, 2000, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt;
Technically it has been defined in several ways by Muslim jurists:
* Bazdawi defines it as moving away from the implications of an analogy to an analogy that is stronger than it.&lt;ref name="Bazdawi"&gt;al-Bazdawi, Usul al-Bazdawi&lt;/ref&gt;
* Al-Halwani defines it as giving up an analogy for a stronger evidence from the [[Quran]], [[Sunnah]] or [[ijma]].&lt;ref name="Bazdawi"/&gt;
* The Maliki jurist, Ibn al-Arabi defines it as sacrificing some of the implications of an evidence by way of exception.&lt;ref name="Bazdawi"/&gt;
* Al-Karkhi defines Istihsan as follows: Istihsan is when one takes a decision on a certain case different from that on which similar cases have been decided on the basis of its precedents, for a reason which is stronger than one found in similar cases and which requires departure from those cases.&lt;ref&gt;Saim Kayadibi, ''Doctrine of Istihsan (Juristic Preference) in Islamic Law'', (Konya: Tablet Kitabevi, 2007), 104. {{ISBN|978-975-6346-79-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Istihsan==
A number of categorisations have been employed by the jurists:
* Istihsan through the text ([[Nass (Islam)|nass]])
* Istihsan on the basis of consensus ([[ijma]])
* Istihsan on the basis of what is good ([[maruf (Islam)|maruf]])
* Istihsan on the basis of necessity ([[darurah]])
* Istihsan on the basis of benefit ([[Maslahah]])
* Istihsan on the basis of analogy ([[qiyas khafi]])

==Examples of Istihsan==
The following comprise classical examples for this principle:
* Abu Hanifah stated that the one who eats out of forgetfulness whilst fasting should repeat the fast - however he moves away from this by the evidence of a narration that allows the fast to stand.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Abd al-Aziz al-Bukhari, Kash al-Asrar, Vol 4,7&lt;/ref&gt;
* Analogy requires that the manufacturing contract with advance payment be prohibited on the basis of analogy - however this is made permissible according to [[ijma]].
* Analogy requires that pure water be used for ablution so wells in which dirt or carcasses of animals have fallen would be prohibited for use according to strict analogy. Necessity exceptionalises this and permits the use of this water provided formal cleaning methods are applied first.

==Criticisms==
[[Al-Shafi'i]] viewed the practice of juristic preference as a heretical usurping [[God in Islam|God]]'s sole right as the legislator of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Shafi'i]], [[Kitab al-Umm]], vol. 7, pg. 309-320. [[Cairo]] Dar al-fikr, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been alleged that this criticism revolves more around the linguistic meaning of the term rather than its technical meaning,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; though modern scholarship regards Shafi'is comments as a direct criticism of the technical meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard G. Weiss]], ''The Search for God's Law: Islamic Jurisprudence in the Writings of Sayf al-Din al-Amidi'', pg. 672. [[Salt Lake City]]: [[University of Utah Press]], 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malik ibn Anas]] is noted to have been asked about binding divorce. When he delivered his response, a disciple of his quickly reached for a tablet to make note of this ruling. Upon realizing what his disciple was doing, Malik asked him to stop, remarking that his opinion could change before nightfall.&lt;ref&gt;Virani, Shafique N. The Ismailis in the Middle Ages: A History of Survival, A Search for Salvation (New York: Oxford University Press), 2007, p.156.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarakhsi points out that some jurists have criticised Istihsan on the grounds that the analogy is being given up for personal opinion, something prohibited in Islam. He refutes this understanding as incomprehensible, as no jurist would give up an authority for something that lacked evidence.&lt;ref&gt;al-Sarakhsi, Kitab al-Usul&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Izidor (Iso) Kršnjavi''' ({{IPA-sh|krʃɲǎːʋi ǐzidor|hr}}, 22 April 1845 – 3 February 1927) was a [[Croats|Croatian]] painter, art historian, curator and politician.

==Biography==
Born in [[Našice]], his first art lessons were obtained in [[Osijek]], where he studied with [[Hugo Conrad von Hötzendorf]].&lt;ref name="GLN"&gt;[http://www.galerija-lavalnugent.com/krsnjavi-izidor-1845-1924 Galerija Laval Nugent: Izidor Kršnjavi]&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to Vienna to study philosophy and [[art history]]. At this time, he was already providing aesthetic and philosophical articles to Croatian journals. He later studied at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]] and lived in Italy from 1872–77, where he copied the old masters.

With the help of [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer]], who he had met in Rome, he became a professor of archaeology and art history at the [[University of Zagreb]]. The next year, he helped establish the Society of Arts, and was, for many years, it secretary and spokesman. He also served as the first Director of the [[Strossmayer Gallery of Old Masters]] and was one of the founders of the [[Museum of Arts and Crafts, Zagreb|Museum of Arts and Crafts]].&lt;ref name="GLN" /&gt;

In 1884, he came into conflict with Strossmayer and his supporters in the [[People's Party (Kingdom of Croatia)|People's Party]], where he supported the pro-Hungarian faction, which allowed him to serve in the Croatian Parliament 1884-87. From 1887 to 1891, he studied law and became the Minister of Education and Religion in the [[Károly Khuen-Héderváry]] administration. While in that office, he established several schools, including one for the blind and deaf, introduced [[physical education]] classes and helped to form the foundation for a unified school system. He had to leave the ministry in 1897, after a protest in which he burned a Hungarian flag. He returned to the University and, in 1906, joined the [[Party of Rights]]. Shortly thereafter, he began painting again.

In addition to being a painter and critic, he also translated [[Dante's Divine Comedy]] into Croatian and was the author of poems, travelogues and two novels. He died in [[Zagreb]].

In Croatian film ''[[Countess Dora]]'' (1993) he is played by [[Relja Bašić]].

Her father was a [[cartoonist]] whose works were published in diverse publications as ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' and ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://library.syr.edu/digital/exhibits/c/cartoonists/drucker.htm Boris Drucker], ''Draw Your Own Conclusions: Political Cartooning Then and ?'', Syracuse University Libraries; [https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=boris-drucker&amp;pid=123106498 Boris Drucker: Obituary], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 17, 2009, on [[Legacy.com]]; [http://www.comicsreporter.com/index.php/resources/longbox/20819 Boris Drucker, 1920-2009], The Comics Reporter, January 20, 2009; Johanna Drucker, "Biographical Essay," ''[http://www.syracuseuniversitypress.syr.edu/spring-2006/pay-attention.html Don't Pay Any Attention to Him, He's 90% Water: The Cartooning Career of Boris Drucker]'', New York: Joseph I. Lubin House of Syracuse University, 2006, pp. 9-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drucker earned her B.F.A. from the [[California College of Arts and Crafts]] in 1973 and her Ph.D. from the [[University of California Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]] in 1986. She was previously the Robertson Professor of Media Studies at the [[University of Virginia]], and has been on the faculties of [[State University of New York at Purchase|Purchase College, SUNY]], [[Yale University]], [[Columbia University]], and the [[University of Texas, Dallas]]. She has also been the Digital Humanities Fellow at the [[Stanford Humanities Center]], Digital Cultures Fellow at [[UC Santa Barbara]], and Mellon Faculty Fellow in Fine Arts at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;[{{dead link|url=http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/files/drucker/drucker_cv.pdf|date=May 2017}} CV]&lt;/ref&gt; She is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

==Research==
Drucker's research focuses on alphabet historiography, modeling interpretation for electronic scholarship, digital aesthetics, the history of visual information design, history of the book and print culture, history of information, and critical studies in visual knowledge representation. Most recently, her scholarship has focused on information visualization, "which draws heavily on models from the empirical sciences, where approaches based on representation and transparency prevail." In contrast to this approach, Drucker stresses the rhetorical and performative nature of visualization, with emphasis on interpretation. She contends that digital tools should be used to "design graphic forms that inscribe subjectivity and affective judgment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/members/drucker UCLA GSE&amp;IS faculty page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207223133/http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/members/drucker |date=2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===

====1990s====
In her first book, ''Theorizing Modernism: Visual Art and the Critical Tradition'' (1994), Drucker maps [[visual arts]] discourses through a rigorous examination of the rhetoric of 19th and 20th century critical writing and art practice. In the process, she theorizes the modernist tradition of visual art through a rhetoric of representation rather than from a formalist or historical approach, particularly regarding [[space]], the ontology of the object, and the production of [[subjectivity]]. In ''The Visible Word: Experimental Typography and Modern Art'' (1994), Drucker contends that much art criticism of [[Futurism]], [[Dada]], and [[Cubism]] has failed to appreciate the fundamental materiality of these movements in relation to both visual and poetic forms of representation. Drucker emphasized, for the first time, the extent to which typographic activity furthered debates about the very nature and function of the [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/bernstein/essays/drucker.html "Book Review:  The Visible Word: Experimental Typography and Modern Art, 1909-1923" Modernism/Modernity 2.3 (1995) 173-175]&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing with her interest in letterform, Drucker's next book, ''The Alphabetic Labyrinth: The Letters in History and Imagination'' (1995) analyzes the history of the alphabet, not just as a collection of arbitrary signs, but as the direct visual embodiment of meaning in relation to intellectual movements. For example, she shows how modern typefaces, first developed in the late 18th century, embody Enlightenment philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thamesandhudson.com/en/1/9780500280683.mxs The Alphabetic Labyrinth: Books:Thames and Hudson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705162529/http://www.thamesandhudson.com/en/1/9780500280683.mxs |date=2008-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shifting her focus to [[artist books]], ''Century of Artists' Books'' (1995) is the first full-length analysis of the development of artists' books as a 20th-century art form, exploring their structure, form, and conceptualization. Analyzing such artistic luminaries as [[William Morris]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Max Ernst]], Drucker considers the book as metaphor, poem, and narrative or non-narrative sequence by situating its historical, theoretical, sociological, and technical aspects within 20th century avant-garde art movements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granarybooks.com/books/drucker2/drucker2.html Johanna Drucker "The Century of Artists' Books]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Figuring the Word: Essays on Books, Writing, and Visual Poetics'' (1998) is a collection of selected critical essays by Drucker previously published in literary and scholarly journals. The book begins with a discussion of her work as a [[book artist]] and an account of what led her to pursue her scholarly interests. She provides close readings of contemporary language artists and the use of language in cyberspace.

====2000s====
In collaboration with Brad Freeman, Drucker produced ''Nova Reperta'' (2000), inspired by illustrations by the sixteenth-century Flemish artist Johannes [[Stradanus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Tate|title=To Figure Out What Is Happening: An Interview with Johanna Drucker|journal=The Journal of Artists' Books|date=Spring 2007|volume=21|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on ''Nova Reperta'' was originally begun by Drucker and Freeman in 1993, who planned to include the work in the exhibition ''Science and the Artist's Book''&lt;ref group=notes&gt;''[http://www.sil.si.edu/Exhibitions/Science-and-the-Artists-Book/ Science and the Artist's Book]''&lt;/ref&gt; organized by the [[Smithsonian Institution Libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drucker|first=Johanna|author2=Brad Freeman|title=Nova Reperta: New Inventions and Discoveries|journal=The Journal of Artists' Books|date=Fall 1999|volume=12|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She collaborated again with Freeman on ''Emerging Sentience'' (2001), a work that reflects Drucker's interest in the literature of artificial intelligence and the development of digital media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Tate|title=To Figure Out What Is Happening: An Interview with Johanna Drucker|journal=The Journal of Artists' Books|date=Spring 2007|volume=21|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Sweet Dreams: Contemporary Art and Complicity'' (2005), Drucker calls for a revamp of the academic critical vocabulary to something more befitting new forms and practices in [[contemporary art]], especially as it engages with material culture. Considered at the cutting edge of art criticism, ''Sweet Dreams'' details the clear departure of artists from modernist avant-garde movements and shows the ways in which art criticism can shift its terms and sensibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/165043.html Sweet Dreams by Johanna Drucker]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Graphic Design History: A Critical Guide'' (2008) is an edited volume that traces the social and cultural role of visual communication from prehistory to the present, from logos to posters, from the political to the commercial, from early writing to digital design. The book details the ways in which designers have historically shaped graphic forms and effects. Taking up evolving issues of methodology in the burgeoning field of [[digital humanities]], ''SpecLab: Digital Aesthetics and Speculative Computing'' (2009) emphasizes the visual over the written system, the generative over the descriptive, and aesthetic subjectivity over analytic objectivism by building on the collective intellectual ferment of digital humanities as it developed at the [[University of Virginia]], one of the universities where the field of digital humanities first developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=bio&amp;bookkey=353566 Johanna Drucker: SpecLab]&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010s====
In ''Graphesis: Visual Forms of Knowledge Production'' (2014), Drucker fuses digital humanities, media studies, and graphic design history to provide a descriptive critical language for the analysis of graphical knowledge and outline the principles by which visual formats organize meaningful content, particularly the [[graphical user interface]].

==Artistic activity==
Drucker is internationally renowned for her book art, which touches on a variety of themes, especially "the exploration of the conventions of narrative prose and the devices by which it orders, sequences, and manipulates events according to its own logic" as well as "the use of experimental typography to expand the possibilities of prose beyond the linear format of traditional presentation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://epc.buffalo.edu/authors/drucker/chron.html A Chronology of Books from 1970 to 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1754">'''Jón Ólafsson of Grunnavík''' (''Jón Ólafsson frá Grunnavík'', also known as ''Jón Grunnvíkingur'' or ''Grunnavíkur-Jón'', 1705–1779) was an Icelandic scholar. Originally  from [[Grunnavík]], [[Westfjords]], northwestern [[Iceland]], he was active in [[Copenhagen]], where he served as assistant to [[Árni Magnússon]].

He is the author of an Icelandic dictionary and a 1732 ''Runologia'', a treatise on [[runology]].  As in the [[Copenhagen Fire of 1728|fire of Copenhagen]] of 1728, the original manuscript of the ''[[Heiðarvíga saga]]'' was lost along with a recent copy made by Jón Grunnvíkingur, he wrote down a summary of the saga from memory, which is the only form in which the saga's contents survive today.

The character of ''Jón Grindvicensis'' in [[Halldór Laxness]]'s historical novel  ''[[Iceland's Bell]]'' is based on Jón Grunnvíkingur.

'''Wu''' ({{zh|c=巫|p=''wū''|w=''wu''|l=[[shaman]]}}) '''shaman''' are spirit mediums who have practiced divination, prayer, sacrifice, rainmaking, and healing in Chinese traditions dating back over 3,000 years. Various [[Wu (shaman)|wu shaman]] are known from thousands of years of Chinese folk religion, mythology, and poetry. Individually and collectively they form an important part of the world's cultural heritage.

==Word ''wu''==
[[File:巫-seal.svg|thumb|Chinese [[Seal script]] for ''wu'' 巫 "shaman"]]
{{Main|Wu (shaman)}}
The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word ''wu'' 巫 "spirit medium; shaman; shamaness; sorcerer; doctor; proper names" was first recorded during the [[Shang dynasty]] (ca. 1600-1046 BCE), when a ''wu'' could be either sex. ''Shaman'' is the common English translation of Chinese ''wu'', but some scholars (de Groot 1910, Mair 1990:35) maintain that the Siberian ''shaman'' and Chinese ''wu'' were historically and culturally different shamanic traditions. [[Arthur Waley]] (1955:9) defines ''wu'' as "spirit-intermediary" and says, "Indeed the functions of the Chinese ''wu'' were so like those of Siberian and Tunguz shamans that it is convenient (as has indeed been done by Far Eastern and European writers) to use shaman as a translation of ''wu''. In contrast, Schiffeler (1976:20) describes the "untranslatableness" of ''wu'', and prefers using the romanization "''wu'' instead of its contemporary English counterparts, "witches," "warlocks," or "shamans"," which have misleading connotations. Taking ''wu'' to mean "female shaman", [[Edward H. Schafer]] translates it as (1951:153) "shamaness" and (1980:11) "shamanka". The transliteration-translation "''wu'' shaman" or "''wu''-shaman" (Unschuld 1985:344) implies "Chinese" specifically and "shamanism" generally. ''Wu'', concludes Falkenhausen (1995:280), "may be rendered as "shaman" or, perhaps, less controversially as "spirit medium"." Paper (1995:85) criticizes "the majority of scholars" who use one word ''shaman'' to translate many Chinese terms (''wu'' 巫, ''xi'' 覡, ''yi'' 毉, ''xian'' 仙, and ''zhu'' 祝), and writes, "The general tendency to refer to all ecstatic religious functionaries as shamans blurs functional differences." The word "shaman" is often pluralized as "shamans", especially in old school sources, but may also be formed into a plural without morphological change, as just "shaman". The ''-man'' ending is distinct from the English word "man", referring to a human being, although some speakers may treat it as such.

==''Li Sao'' shaman list==
In the [[Li Sao|''Li Sao'']], two individual shaman are specified.

This Wu Xian may or may not be the same as the (one or more) historical person(s) named [[Wu Xian (astronomer)|Wu Xian]]. Hawkes suggests an equation of the word ''ling'' in the Chu dialect with the word ''wu''.(46 and 84)

==''Shanhaijing'' 6 list==
In some cases, the individual wu shaman are known from sources, such as the ''[[Shanhaijing]]'' (''Classic of Mountains and Seas''). The name of some individual shaman includes "Wu" (巫) in the normal position of the family surname, for example, in the case of the following list, where the 6 are depicted together reviving a corpse, with Wu Peng holding the Herb of Immortality.(Hawkes:45 and 230-231):

*Wu Yang (巫陽, "Shaman Bright")
*Wu Peng (巫彭)
*Wu Di (巫抵)
*Wu Li (巫履) [Tang reconstruction *Lǐ, Hanyu Pinyin Lǚ]
*Wu Fan (巫凡)
*Wu Xiang (巫相)

Wu Peng and Wu Yang and others are also known from the ''Chu Ci'' poetry anthology. Wu Yang is the major speaker in ''[[Zhao Hun]]'' (also known as, ''Summons for the Soul'').

==''Shanhaijing'' 10 list==
The Lingshan 10 are:

*Wu Xian (巫咸)
*Wu Ji (巫即)
*Wu Fen (or Ban) (巫肦)
*Wu Peng (巫彭)
*Wu Gu (巫姑)
*Wu Zhen (巫真)
*Wu Li (巫禮)
*Wu Di (巫抵)
*Wu Xie (巫謝)
*Wu Luo (巫羅)

[[File:The first Apollo 11 sample return container is unloaded.jpg|thumb|First samples from the Moon being delivered to LRL in 1969]]

The '''Lunar Receiving Laboratory''' ('''LRL''') was a facility at [[NASA]]'s [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] (Building 37) that was constructed to [[quarantine]] [[astronauts]] and material brought back from the [[Moon]] during the [[Apollo program]] to mitigate the risk of [[back-contamination]]. After recovery at sea, crews from [[Apollo 11]],  [[Apollo 12]] and  [[Apollo 14]] walked from their [[helicopter]] to the [[Mobile Quarantine Facility]] on the deck of an [[aircraft carrier]] and were brought to the LRL for quarantine. Samples of rock and [[regolith]] that the astronauts collected and brought back were flown directly to the LRL and initially analyzed in [[glovebox]] [[vacuum chamber]]s.

:::[[File:NASA-Houston LRL-installation.png]]

The quarantine requirement was dropped beginning with [[Apollo 15]] and the LRL was used for study, distribution and safe storage of the lunar samples. Between 1969 and 1972, six Apollo space flight missions brought back 382 kilograms (842 pounds) of lunar rocks, core samples, pebbles, sand and dust from the lunar surface. The six space flights returned 2200 separate samples from six different exploration sites on the lunar surface.  (Other lunar samples were returned to Earth by three automated Soviet spacecraft, named [[Luna 16]], [[Luna 20]], and [[Luna 24]], which returned samples totaling 300&amp;nbsp;grams (approximately 3/4 pound) from three other lunar sites.)

In 1976, a portion of the samples were moved to [[Brooks Air Force Base]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]] for second-site storage. In 1979, a [[Lunar Sample Laboratory Facility]] was built to serve as the chief repository for the Apollo samples. It was constructed to provide permanent storage of the lunar sample collection in a physically secure and non-contaminating environment. The facility consists of storage vaults for the samples, laboratories for sample preparation and study, a vault for sample data and records, and machinery to supply nitrogen to the cabinets in which the samples are stored and processed. [http://www-curator.jsc.nasa.gov/lunar/lun-fac.cfm] The Lunar Receiving Laboratory building is currently occupied by the Life Sciences division. It contains biomedical and environment labs, and is used for experiments involving human adaptation to [[microgravity]].

The '''Mexico Peace Index (MPI)''' is one in a series of National Peace Indices produced by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace|Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP)]]. The MPI provides a comprehensive measure of peacefulness in Mexico, the fifth edition of the MPI was released in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noroeste.com.mx/publicaciones/view/Violencia_le_costo_a_Mexico_el_18_de_su_PIB_en_2016_segun_estudio-1077123|title=Violencia le costó a México el 18% de su PIB en 2016, según estudio - Periódico Noroeste|website=Noroeste.com.mx|language=es|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report is released in both Spanish and English, and analyzes the economic benefits that would occur from increases in peace, and provides an estimate relating to the economic impact violence has had on Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/2013/12/mexico-peace-index-just-launched/ 'Mexico Peace Index just launched'] Alliance for Peacebuilding, retrieved 2013-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Index uses the same definition of peace as the [[Global Peace Index]], [[United States Peace Index]] and [[United Kingdom Peace Index]], which it defines as the absence of violence or the absence of the fear of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/MPI%20Report%202013.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mexico Peace Index 2013 |page=4 |website=Visionofhumanity.org |accessdate=2017-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213145206/http://visionofhumanity.org/sites/default/files/MPI%20Report%202013.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year a large press conference is held and attended by many civil society reps, including [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Mexico)|INEGI]], COMCE, [[Coparmex]], [[FEMSA]], Mexico Evalua, Mexico Contra la Delincuencia. Additionally the press conferences are attended by journalists from multiple media outlets including the [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]], AFP, EFE, [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]], [[The New York Times|NY Times]], [[Telemundo]], Reforma, [[El Universal (Caracas)|El Universal]], [[El Economista (Mexico)|El Economista]], [[TV Azteca]], [[Milenio Televisión|Milenio TV]], Expansion, Radio Formula, MVS Radio, W Radio, [[Notimex]]. Each year the launch of the report generates wide spread domestic media coverage, with 500 media pieces covering the 2017 launch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2739">'''Missions Héliographiques''' was a 19th-century project to photograph landmarks and monuments around France so that they could be restored.

The project was established by [[Prosper Mérimée]], France's Inspector General of Historical Monuments and author of ''[[Carmen (novella)|Carmen]]'', in 1851.  The intent was to supplement [[Monument historique]], a program Mérimée started in 1837 to classify, protect and restore [[France|French]] landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;[[Naomi Rosenblum|Rosenblum, Naomi]]. "Documentation: Landscape and Architecture." ''A World History of Photography.'' Ed. Walton Rawls and Nancy Grubb. 3rd ed. New York: Abbeville Press, 1997. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Mérimée hired [[Edouard Baldus]], [[Hippolyte Bayard]], [[Gustave Le Gray]], [[Henri Le Secq]] and [[Auguste Mestral]] &lt;ref name="Rosenblum, p. 100"&gt;Rosenblum, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; to carry out the photography, with the aim that architect [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] could eventually restore them.

Although the [[daguerrotype]] originated in [[France]], Mérimée preferred the [[calotype]], which offered more detailed textures.&lt;ref&gt;Fulton, Marianne. European Architecture. J 362E. Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas. 31 Jan. 2008.{{vague|date=December 2010}}&lt;!-- What is this? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GustaveLeGray.jpg|thumb|right|Central Portal of the Church of Saint-Jacques, [[Aubeterre-sur-Dronne|Aubeterre]] - Gustave Le Gray (1851)|390x390px]]

Mestral and Le Gray photographed areas southwest from [[Paris]], Le Secq the north and east. Bayard, who chose to work with glass negatives instead of paper, went west to [[Brittany]] and [[Normandy]].  Baldus covered the south and east, including the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/TOAH/hd/heli/hd_heli.htm Mission Héliographique, 1851 | Thematic Essay | Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

While several of the images are classic examples of early photography, the overall results did not meet requirements, often portraying the decaying buildings artistically and obscuring their need for restoration.&lt;ref name="Rosenblum, p. 100"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lemagny|first=Jean-Claude|title=A History of Photography: Social and Cultural Perspectives|year=1986|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-34407-7|pages=55–56|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3415">'''Moral certainty''' is a concept of intuitive [[probability]]. It means a very high degree of probability, sufficient for action, but short of absolute or mathematical certainty.

==Origins==
The notion of different degrees of certainty can be traced back to a statement in [[Aristotle]]'s [[Nicomachean Ethics]] that one must be content with the kind of certainty appropriate to different subject matters, so that in practical decisions one cannot expect the certainty of mathematics. &lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Ethics'' (1976) pp. 64–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin phrase ''moralis certitudo'' was first used by the [[France|French]] philosopher [[Jean Gerson]] about 1400,&lt;ref&gt;H. E. Braun/E. Vallance eds., ''The Renaissance Conscience'' (2011) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; to provide a basis for moral action that could (if necessary) be ''less'' exact than Aristotelian practical knowledge, thus avoiding the dangers of [[philosophical scepticism]] and opening the way for a benevolent [[casuistry]].&lt;ref&gt;Braun, p. 12 and p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] mentions occurrences in English from 1637. 

==Law==
In law, moral (or 'virtual') certainty has been associated with [[verdict]]s based on certainty [[beyond a reasonable doubt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=1281&amp;bold=%7C%7C%7C%7C Legal definition of "moral certainty"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral certainty, a quantum of evidence of about 100 percent proof, is required in two kinds of cases:
# In a criminal prosecution, when no [[direct evidence]] exists, the [[circumstantial evidence]] must be ''morally certain''; see ''[[Lizzie Borden]]''.
# In a [[DNA paternity testing|paternity testing]] case, when a [[putative father]] has been adjudicated to be the actual father by [[clear and convincing evidence]], then ''moral certainty'' is required to disprove [[Parent|paternity]], the [[Blame|onus]] being moved to the newly found father.


Legal debate about instructions to seek a moral certainty has turned on the changing definitions of the phrase over time. Whereas it ''can'' be understood as an equivalent to 'beyond reasonable doubt', in another sense moral certainty refers to a firm conviction which ''does not'' correlate but rather opposes evidentiary certainty:&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Moore, ''Mass Communication Law and Ethics'' (1999) pp. 52–3&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. one may have a firm subjective gut feeling of guilt – a feeling of moral certainty – without the evidence necessarily justifying a guilty conviction.

'''Naro Space Center''' is a [[South Korea]]n [[spaceport]] in [[South Jeolla]]'s [[Goheung|Goheung County]], operated by the state-run [[Korea Aerospace Research Institute]].

The spaceport is located about {{convert|485|km|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} south of [[Seoul]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/techscience/2009/08/20/0601000000AEN20090820004200320.HTML ''Software glitch halts rocket launch'' - Yonhap News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a launch pad, a control tower, rocket assembly and test facilities, facilities for satellite control testing and assembly, a media center, an electric power station, a space experience hall and a landing field.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.spacedaily.com/news/korea-03b.html South Korea Begins Construction Of New Space Center]'' – Korean Information Service, ''SpaceDaily'', August 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Korea to enter space race in 2008", http://www.korea.net/News/News/NewsView.asp?serial_no=20080102014&amp;part=107|, Ro Ji-woong Korea.net Staff Writer, 03 January, 2008, accessed October 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The first launch, initially planned for 19 August 2009, was performed on 25 August 2009 using a Russo-South Korean [[Naro-1]] rocket, but failed to reach the desired orbit. Another rocket launch from Naro was planned for May 2010, but delays pushed the launch to June. On June 10, 2010, this second attempt also ended in failure when the rocket lost communications 137 seconds after launch.  The South Korean science minister Ahn Byung-man  later told reporters that the rocket was believed to have exploded. A third attempt was made on January 30th 2013 and finally succeeded in putting a satellite into orbit.

South Korea's next rocket, the [[KSLV-2]] is also scheduled to be launched from Naro in 2019.

[[Image:Niels Bohr Institute 1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Niels Bohr Institute in 2005]]

The '''Niels Bohr Institute''' (Danish: ''Niels Bohr Institutet'') is a research institute of the [[University of Copenhagen]]. The research of the institute spans [[astronomy]], [[geophysics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[particle physics]], [[quantum mechanics]] and [[biophysics]].

==Overview==
The Institute was founded in 1921, as the Institute for Theoretical Physics of the University of Copenhagen, by the Danish theoretical physicist [[Niels Bohr]], who had been on the staff of the University of Copenhagen since 1914, and who had been lobbying for its creation since his appointment as professor in 1916. On the 80th anniversary of Niels Bohr's birth – October 7, 1965 – the Institute officially became the Niels Bohr Institute.&lt;ref&gt;"Bohr Institute" in John L. Heilbron, ''The Oxford Companion to the History of Modern Science'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 2003), {{ISBN|978-0199743766}}, pp. 103–104. [https://books.google.com/books?id=abqjP-_KfzkC&amp;lpg=PA104&amp;dq=Institute%20for%20Theoretical%20Physics%20copenhagen%201921&amp;pg=PA103#v=onepage&amp;q=Institute%20for%20Theoretical%20Physics%20copenhagen%201921&amp;f=false Excerpts available] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; Much of its original funding came from the charitable foundation of the [[Carlsberg Group|Carlsberg]] brewery, and later from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Pais]], [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/themes/physics/pais/index.html?print=1#footnote30 "Physics in Denmark: The First Four Hundred Years"], lecture delivered March 6, 1996, reprinted at [[Nobelprize.org]], February 21, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, and 1930s, the Institute was the center of the developing disciplines of [[atomic physics]] and [[quantum physics]]. [[Physicist]]s from across Europe (and sometimes further abroad) often visited the Institute to confer with Bohr on new theories and discoveries. The [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics is named after work done at the Institute during this time.

On January 1, 1993 the institute was merged with the Astronomic Observatory, the Ørsted Laboratory and the Geophysical Institute. The new resulting institute retained the name Niels Bohr Institute.

==Research sections==
Research at the Niels Bohr Institute is organised in ten research sections covering a broad range of physics, i.e. astrophysics, biophysics, solid state physics, geophysics, particle physics and e-science.

==Medal of Honour==
[[File:Niels Bohr Institute Medal-A.jpg|thumb|Niels Bohr Institute Medal-A]]
[[File:Niels Bohr Institute Medal-R.jpg|thumb|Niels Bohr Institute Medal-R]]
in 2010, the year of the 125th anniversary of the birth of Niels Bohr, the Institute established the '''Niels Bohr Institute Medal of Honour'''. It is an annual award for "a particularly outstanding researcher who is working in the spirit of Niels Bohr: International cooperation and the exchange of knowledge".&lt;ref name="professor-ignazio-cirac"&gt;[https://archive.is/20130217085217/http://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/namely_names/2012/professor-ignacio-cirac-receives-the-niels-bohr-institute-medal-of-honour/ Professor Ignacio Cirac receives the Niels Bohr Institute Medal of Honour], Niels Bohr Institute, January 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The medal is made by Danish sculptor [[Rikke Raben]] for the Niels Bohr Institute. On the front is a portrait of Niels Bohr, the atom sign and stars. The illustration on the back is inspired by a quote from Bohr: ''What is it that we human beings ultimately depend on? We depend on our words. We are suspended in language. Our task is to communicate experience and ideas to others''.&lt;ref&gt;Aage Petersen, 'the philosophy of Niels Bohr' in Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 1963, XIX,7, p.10. It is quoted on the inside of the medal box.&lt;/ref&gt; 
On the back of the medal: ''Unity of Knowledge'' – the title of a lecture given by Bohr at [[Columbia University]] in 1954. ''Nosce te ipsum'' is [[Latin]] and means "know thyself". This quote originates from the [[Oracle of Delphi]], in the Temple of [[Apollo]] in Greece.

'''Odyssey Studios''' was a recording studio based near [[Marble Arch]] in London and opened in 1979. It was set up by [[Wayne Bickerton]] as an extension of [[State Records]], the label he had set up with [[Tony Waddington (songwriter)|Tony Waddington]] and John Fruin in 1975. The studio closed in 1989 and the building was subsequently sold to [[102.2 Jazz FM|Jazz FM]].&lt;ref name="Tony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonywaddington.co.uk/tony_v4.swf |title=Tony Waddington |publisher=Tonywaddington.co.uk |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Albums recorded at Odyssey==
Through the 1980s, many artists recorded at Odyssey Studios, including [[Cliff Richard]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Kate Bush]], [[George Michael]], [[Spandau Ballet]] and [[Roger Daltrey]].&lt;ref name="Tony"/&gt; Below is a list of some albums recorded either in part or entirely at Odyssey Studios.

==Set-up and equipment==
Studio One in Odyssey was 1,400 square feet and had room for 50 musicians, which meant it could facilitate orchestral recordings and could be used for other activities such as video shoots. Studios 1 and 2 were equipped with MCI consoles and tape machines. Peter Jones (chief engineer) went to Fort Lauderdale, home of MCI, to commission all the equipment. At the time, they were the largest consoles that MCI had produced, and a hole in the factory wall was required to accommodate the extra length of the chassis. The studio was designed by Keith Slaughter and constructed on the "floating" principle to ensure total sound insulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E5zzEdWiy4 |title=Odyssey Studios Tour |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2012-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studio Two, which was a mixing suite with capacity for 8 musicians, had an MCI 6000 48 Channel Desk which offered up to 48 tracks of recording, or the capacity to mixdown. Upstairs there was a radio facility, which offered a studio and separate control room plus a lounge area.

Odyssey was one of the first studios to install a satellite linkup, which effectively turned the studio into a miniature radio station and allowing it to broadcast any session live around the world.

Open source approaches have created technology such as [[Linux]] (and to some extent, the [[Android (operating system)|Android operating system]]). Additionally, open source approaches applied to documents have inspired [[wiki]]s and their largest example, [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref name="wheeler"/&gt; Open security suggests that security breaches and vulnerabilities can be better prevented or ameliorated when users facing these problems collaborate using open source philosophies.&lt;ref name="wheeler"/&gt;

This approach requires that users be legally allowed to collaborate, so relevant software would need to be released under a license that is widely accepted to be open source; examples include the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) license, the Apache 2.0 license, the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), and the GNU General Public License (GPL).&lt;ref name="wheeler"/&gt; Relevant documents would need to be under a generally accepted "open content" license; these include Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) and Attribution Share Alike (CC-BY-SA) licenses, but not Creative Commons "non-commercial" licenses or "no-derivative" licenses.&lt;ref name="wheeler"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="890">'''Petasti''' (or Petaste; [[Greek language|Greek]]: πεταστη) is a [[neume]] of [[Byzantine chant]] notation, which is usually called a flutter in [[English language|English]]. In the most general form it means "Go one note up, and stress this note",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.byzantinechant.org/notation/Table%20of%20Byzantine%20Notation%20Symbols.pdf Short table of Byzantine neumes]&lt;/ref&gt; where the "stress" is usually interpreted either as a [[mordent]] of Western music (in a high tempo), as a [[tuplet|triplet]] (in a medium [[tempo]]), or as a sequence of two [[eighth note]]s and a [[quarter note]] (in a slow tempo).

Petasti can also be combined with other neumes, such as [[oligon]], to form jumps of more than one note up, still stressed with a flutter.

Petasti [[Unicode]] symbol is U+1D049.

[[Bioacoustics]] refers to the creation and reception of sound waves among biological organisms. Measured sound emissions by plants as well as differential germination rates, growth rates and behavioral modifications in response to sound are well documented.&lt;ref&gt;Gagliano M, Renton M, Duvdevani N, Timmins M, Mancuso S. Out of Sight but Not out of Mind: Alternative Means of Communication in Plants. Moora M, ed. PLoS ONE. 2012;7(5):e37382. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0037382.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants detect neighbors by means other than well-established communicative signals including volatile chemicals, light detection, direct contact and root signaling.&lt;ref&gt;Smith H. Phytochromes and light signal perception by plants–an emerging synthesis. Nature. 2000;407:585–591. [PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karban R, Shiojiri K. Ecol Lett 12: 502–506. (doi; 2009. Self-recognition affects plant communication and defense. 10.1111/j.1461–0248.2009.01313.x) [PubMed]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pare PW, Tumlinson JH. Plant volatiles as a defense against insect herbivores. Plant Physiol. 1999;121:325–331. [PMC free article] [PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt; Because sound waves travel efficiently through soil and can be produced with minimal energy expenditure, plants may use sound as a means for interpreting their environment and surroundings. Preliminary evidence supports that plants create sound in root tips when cell walls break.&lt;ref&gt;Gagliano M (in review) Green symphonies: a call for studies on sound communication in plants. [PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt; Because plant roots respond only to sound waves at frequencies which match waves emitted by the plants themselves, it is likely that plants can receive and transduce sound vibrations into signals to elicit behavioral modifications  as a form of below ground communication.&lt;ref name="Gagliano 2012"&gt;Gagliano, M., Mancuso, S., &amp; Robert, D. (2012). Towards understanding plant bioacoustics. Trends in Plant Science, 17(6), 323-325.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buzz pollination]], or sonication, serves as an example of a behavioral response to specific frequencies of vibrations in plants. Some 2000 plants species, including ''Dodecatheon'' and ''Heliamphora'' have evolved buzz pollination in which they release pollen from anthers only when vibrated at a certain frequency created exclusively by bee flight muscles. The vibrations cause pollen granules to gain kinetic energy and escape from pores in the anthers.&lt;ref&gt;Buchmann, S., &amp; Hurley, J. (1978). A biophysical model for buzz pollination in angiosperms. Journal of Theoretical Biology, 72(4), 639-57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants emit audio acoustic emissions between 10–240&amp;nbsp;Hz as well as ultrasonic acoustic emissions (UAE) within 20–300&amp;nbsp;kHz. Evidence for plant mechanosensory abilities are shown when roots are subjected to unidirectional 220&amp;nbsp;Hz sound and subsequently grow in the direction of the vibration source.&lt;ref name="Gagliano 2012"/&gt; Using electrograph vibrational detection, structured sound wave emissions were detected along the elongation zone of root tips of corn plants in the form of loud and frequent clicks. When plants are isolated from contact, chemical, and light signal exchange with neighboring plants they are still able to sense their neighbors and detect relatives through alternative mechanisms, among which sound vibrations could play an important role. Furthermore, ultrasonic acoustic emissions (UAE) have been detected in a range of different plants which result from collapsing water columns under high tension.&lt;ref&gt;Laschimke R, Burger M, Vallen H. 2006. Acoustic emission analysis and experiments with physical model systems reveal a peculiar nature of the xylem tension. J Plant Physiol. 163:996–1007 [PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt; UAE studies show different frequencies of sound emissions based on whether or not drought conditions are present. Whether or not UAE are used by plants as a communication mechanism is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Perks MP, Irvine J, Grace J. 2004. Xylem acoustic signals from mature Pinus sylvestris during an extended drought. Ann Forest Sci. 61:1–8&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Although the explicit mechanisms through which sound emissions are created and detected in plants are not known, there are theories which shed light on possible mechanisms. Mechanical vibrations caused by charged cell membranes and walls is a leading hypothesis for acoustic emission generation. Myosins and other mechanochemical enzymes which use chemical energy in the form of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to produce mechanical vibrations in cells may also contribute to sound wave generation in plant cells. These mechanisms may lead to overall nanomechanical oscillations of cytoskeletal components, which can generate both low and high frequency vibrations.&lt;ref name="Gagliano 2012"/&gt;

The '''ProgramByDesign project''', formerly known as '''TeachScheme! project''', is an outreach effort of the [[Racket (programming language)|PLT]]
research group. The goal is to train college faculty, high school teachers and
possibly even middle school teachers in programming and computing.

==History==

[[Matthias Felleisen]] and [[Racket (programming language)|PLT]] started the effort in 1995 (January, one day after the POPL symposium)
in response to observations of his Rice freshmen students and the algebra curriculum
of local public schools. His objective was to use functional programming to bring
mathematics alive and to help inject design knowledge into the introductory
[[computer science]] [[curriculum]].

The group raised funds from several private foundations, the US Department of Education, and the National Science Foundation to create 
* software appropriate for novices in functional programming
* courseware (curricula, lecture notes, exercises, mini-projects)
* teacher training camps.

Over ten years, it ran several dozen one-week workshops for some 550 teachers.  In
2005, the TeachScheme! project ran an Anniversary workshop where two dozen teachers
presented their work with students.

In 2010, [[Racket (programming language)|PLT]] renamed its major programming language [[Racket (programming language)|Racket]].  At the same time, the group renamed  DrScheme to [[DrRacket]] and a little later TeachScheme! to ProgramByDesign.

==Functional Programming, Computing and Algebra==

The starting point of ProgramByDesign is the observation that students act as computers in
grade school courses on arithmetic and middle/high school courses on
pre/algebra. Teachers program them with rules and run specific problems via
exercises. The key is that students execute purely functional programs.

If we can turn students into teachers that create functional programs and run them
on computers, we can reinforce this content and show students how writing down
mathematics and how writing down functional programs creates lively animated scenes
and even computer games.

Here is an example: 
&lt;source lang="racket"&gt;
(require 2htdp/universe)
(require 2htdp/image)

;; create an image from the current time 
(define (create-image t) 
   (place-image APPLE 50 (* 1/10 t t) SPACE))

;; names for basic images 
(define APPLE (circle 3 "solid"  "red"))
(define SPACE (empty-scene 100 100))

(animate create-image)
&lt;/source&gt;
This short program simulates an apple falling from the top to the bottom of a
small white canvas. It consists of three parts: 
* a function definition for create-image, which is a one-line function in mathematics, assuming an algebra of images with place-image, circle, and empty-scene have been introduced;
* two abbreviations, where names are equated with some value, just as in "let x be 5" in an algebra text; and
* one line for running the program.

A teacher can explain create-image as easily as any ordinary function in an algebra
course. For example, one can first draw a table with two rows and ''n''
columns where each column contains ''t'' at the top and an appropriate image at
the bottom. That is, if the numbers increase from left to right, then on each image the
red dot is a little bit lower.

Finally the animate line applies the given function, create-image, at the
rate of 28 ticks per second to 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. The resulting images are 
displayed on the computer monitor at the same pace. That's how movies are made.

The background needed for such an example is little more than knowledge about making
movies, about the algebra of pictures in [[DrRacket]] (which is like the one for
numbers), and minimal pre-algebra. The ProgramByDesign project claims, however, that
children would have more fun with such "live" functions than with algebraic
expressions that count the number of garden tiles [see Prentice Hall books for
grades 8-9].

The ProgramByDesign project proposes that both traditional mathematics as well as
science courses could benefit from an integration of this form of programming. In
contrast to the traditional Basic or Visual Basic blocks in such books, a Racket
program consists of as many lines as the mathematics. Moving between the mathematics
and the program is thus straightforward. Better still, the meaning of the two are
the same. [[DrRacket]]'s algebraic stepper can illustrate how Racket evaluates the
program as if it were a sixth or seventh grade student, step by step, using plain
algebra.

==Functional Programming, Computing and Design in Programming 101==

For the introductory curriculum on programming, the ProgramByDesign project emphasizes
that courses should focus on the role of systematic design. Even if students never
program again, they should see how helpful a systematic approach to problem solving
is. This should help them whether they become programmers or doctors or journalists or
photographers. Thus, an introductory course in programming would not be perceived as a
place where students learn about the syntax of the currently fashionable (and soon-to-be-obsolete) programming
languages, but a place where they can learn something widely applicable.

The key design element of the ProgramByDesign curriculum is the ''design recipe''.
It has two dimensions: the process dimension and the data dimension.

Along the process dimension students learn that there are six steps to designing a
(simple) program, before they can run it and others can use it: 
# problem analysis with the goal of describing the classes of data that go into the program and come out;
# the reformulation of the problem statement as a concise purpose statement;
# the creation of examples that illustrate the purpose statement and that serve as criteria for success;
# the organization of givens, also called a template or inventory;
# coding;
# and the creation of a test suite from examples to ensure the program works properly on small inputs.
Note that, as in [[test-driven development]], test cases are written ''before'' coding, as part of requirements analysis, rather than afterward as part of testing.

Almost any human endeavour can benefit from clearly understanding the problem, defining criteria for success, analyzing the available resources/givens, developing a proposed solution, and checking it against the criteria, in that order.
A journalist, for example, benefits from
a similar process: figuring out the major concepts in a story; coining a headline;
lining up examples and specific data; organizing the article about the story of
the givens and how the story unfolded; writing; and fact checking.

The data dimension can be summarized by the maxim ''the shape of the data determines the shape of the code and tests.''  For example, if the input or output data type has three variants, a test suite should have at least one test case from each variant, and program code will probably contain a three-way conditional (whether explicit or hidden in a polymorphic dispatch).  If the input or output data type has three fields, a test suite will have to specify values for those three fields, and program code will have to refer to those three fields.  If the input or output data type has a simple ''base case'' and one or more self-referential variants, the test suite should include a base case and one or more non-base cases, and the program code will probably have a base case and one or more self-referential cases, isomorphic to the data type.  The technique of [[recursion]], rather than being scary and mysterious, is simply the application of already-learned techniques to a self-referential data type.

Organizing the givens is the task of translating the descriptions of data into a
program skeleton. Each form of description determines a specific form of program
organization. The transformation is nearly mechanical and helps the students focus
on the creative part of the task.

[[How to Design Programs]] is the text book authored by the core of the ProgramByDesign
group.

==ProgramByDesign and choice of programming language==

The name TeachScheme! appears to imply that this design recipe requires Scheme (now [[Racket (programming language)|Racket]])
and is only teachable with Scheme. Neither conclusion is true, however.  Members of PLT and their trainees have successfully applied the design recipe
in Assembly, C, Java, ML, Python, and other programming languages, not to speak of
poetry, geometry, and biology courses. The fundamental idea of ProgramByDesign is to stress programming as a design activity. 
This misconception is one of the reasons for the renaming actions taken in 2010.

To get started the ProgramByDesign project has produced three essential elements:
* a series of successively more powerful and permissive teaching languages, which are dialects of Racket, matched to the design recipe but with error reporting matched to the student's level (for example, many things that are legal in standard Racket, but which a beginning student doesn't need, are flagged as errors in the Beginning Student level);
* a beginner-friendly, freely-downloadable, pedagogic programming environment, [[DrRacket]], that enforces these language levels;
* a curriculum, encoded mostly in the book [[HTDP]] and its (draft) successor [http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/HtDP2e/ HtDP 2nd Edition]
Their choice of Racket reflects their belief that Racket is a good language for a
small team with little funding (in comparison to Java) to validate their
conjectures. The PLT group has always tried to ensure, however, that the ideas remain
portable to other contexts.

==ProgramByDesign for Java==

Over the past few years, the team has also created a second part of the
curriculum. It demonstrates how the same design recipe ideas apply to a complex
[[object-oriented programming]] language, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]].
This phase of the curriculum applies the same design recipe to Java, initially in a functional paradigm, then introducing object-oriented concepts such as polymorphism and inheritance, and then introducing the imperative techniques that are idiomatic in mainstream Java.

A part of the team has a grant from the National Science Foundation for conducting field tests in colleges 
and high schools. Professional-development workshops took place in the summer of 2007, 2008, 2009, and  2010. This part of the project is dubbed ReachJava; the accompanying book is
tentatively titled "How to Design Classes."

==ProgramByDesign and Bootstrap==

In 2006 PLT at Northeastern University and [[Citizen Schools]] from Boston made joint efforts to reach out to inner city students with after-school programs. Citizen Schools is a nationwide organization that matches volunteers with after-school program sites and gets them started with scripted curricula. The goal of the effort is to translate the material into a sixth-grade curriculum. The first few tests were a great success in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Talks/Moby-Bootstrap/&lt;/ref&gt; The effect on the mathematics courses of this program has encouraged Microsoft
and Google to fund a national scale-up effort, developing materials for training teachers and creating sites in Texas, California, and other volunteer cities.

{{Redirect|PROUT||Prout (disambiguation)}}
[[File:PROUTlogo.gif|thumb|180px|Progressive Utilization Theory logo]]
'''Progressive Utilization Theory''' (Prout), also known by the acronym '''PROUT''', is a [[socioeconomic]] and political theory developed by philosopher and spiritual leader [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]].&lt;ref name="Crovetto2008" /&gt;{{r|"Crovetto2011"}} The theory is based on his holistic outlook of life.{{r|:7|:0}} It is a system of governance&lt;ref name="Skrbina" /&gt; that is inspired by [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] thought, as well as Sarkar's own ideas. It aims to be [[Economic progressivism|economically progressive]] and improve [[Social change|social development]].{{r|:7|p=1}} The theory is in line with Sarkar's [[Neohumanism|Neohumanist]] values which aim to provide "proper care" to every being on the planet, including  humans, animals and plants.{{r|:1}}

== History ==
By 1959, Sarkar had developed the ideas of Prout. In 1961, the theory was formally outlined in his book ''Ananda Sutram'', published under his spiritual name Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti.{{r|Irving}}

In 1968, Sarkar founded the organisation "Proutist Block of India" (PBI), to further the ideals of his theory through political and social action.{{r|fukui|p=357}} The PBI was soon superseded by "Proutist Universal" (PU), which primarily consists of five federations (students, intellectuals, farmers, labour, and youth).{{When|date=May 2018}} 

The theory has not achieved widespread implementation.&lt;ref name=Jones /&gt;{{When|date=May 2018}} Cooperative communities have been established by [[Ananda Marga]] in an attempt to provide ideal models for the society outlined in Prout.&lt;ref name=Ellwood/&gt;{{When|date=May 2018}}

==Theory==
=== Overview ===
Prout proposes an [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] system as an alternative to [[communism]] and [[capitalism]], taking ideas from both.&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt; Under the system [[Tangible property|material goods]] would be [[common ownership|common property]] and [[Distribution (economics)|distributed]] in a rational and equitable way to maximize the physical, mental, and spiritual development of all people.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Onwuka /&gt; The distribution intends to guarantee food, clothing, shelter, education, and medical care (what the theory regards as minimum requirements for humans).&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt;

Prout advocates a three-tiered approach to [[industrial organization]]. Key industries and [[public utilities]] would be [[nonprofit organization]]s. Decentralized industry run by [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] unions would provide people's minimum necessities. The majority of economic transactions would be through producers' and consumers' [[cooperative]]s.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; Incentives for people serving society would be funded via surpluses.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

At the political level, Prout rejects [[nationalism]]. Instead, there would be locally governed self-sufficient socioeconomic zones and a [[world government]].&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=Inayatullah/&gt; There would be a world [[constitution]] and a [[bill of rights]] for animals and plants, as well as humans.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

=== Law of social cycle and governance ===
{{main|Law of social cycle}}
Prout takes account of Sarkat's [[law of social cycle]]. It sees the [[social order]] as consisting of four [[Social class|classes of people]] that cyclically dominate society: ''shudras'' (workers), ''kshatriyas'' (warriors), ''vipras'' (intellectuals) and ''vaishyas'' (acquisitors).&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

However, Prout does not seek the abolition of these four classes, as it sees them as "... not merely as a power configuration, but as a way of knowing the world, as a paradigm, episteme or deep structure if you will."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It considers that any person can be worker, warrior, intellectual or acquisitive minded.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prout in a Nutshell, volume 4|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, these different class or psychologies, are not seen as static or mutually exclusive. The theory sees them as evolving over an individual's lifetime.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

Prout see the four classes as connected to cyclic processes across time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; That when a class of people struggle and rise to power they cause a revolution in the physical and mental world.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The theory then see the newly powerful class becoming corrupt.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; To prevent any social class from clinging to political power and exploiting the others, a "spiritual elite" sadvipras (etymologically sad – true, vipra – intellectual) would determine who will hold political leadership.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; Prout theorises that the first sadvipras would come from disgruntled middle-class intellectuals and warriors.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; 

Sadvipras would be organized into [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature|legislative]], and [[judiciary|judicial]] boards which would be governed by a Supreme Board.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt; They would be responsible for the application of force necessary to change the order of dominance within the social order. It is envisioned that large amounts of force, akin to [[revolution]], may be necessary.&lt;ref name=Crovetto2011/&gt;

=== Neohumanism ===
{{main|Neohumanism}}
The Prout theory is inline with Sarkar's Neohumanism philosophy. The philosophy is a reinterpretation of [[humanism]]{{r|bio|:0}} integrating the idea of unity of all life. In it all living beings belong to a universal family deserving equal care and respect.{{r|:1}}



=== The five fundamental principles ===
In 1962, Sarkar formally outlined Prout in sixteen [[aphorism]]s (see Chapter 5 of ''Ananda Sutram''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ananda Sutram|last=Anandamurti|first=Shrii Shrii|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1962|isbn=8172520271|location=Jamalpur|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The last five aphorisms (5:12-16) are commonly referred to as the five fundamental principles of Prout. These five principles are deemed to be fundamental because it would be difficult to get a clear understanding of Prout without comprehending the underlying concepts of these principles, the interrelationship of the principles, and their respective areas of application.

The five aphorisms from Ananda Sutram translate into English as follows:&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Principles for a Balanced Economy: An Introduction to the Progressive Utilization Theory|last=Bjonnes|first=Roar|publisher=PROUT Research institute|year=2012|isbn=9780985758509|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# There should be no accumulation of wealth without the permission of society.
# There should be maximum utilization and rational distribution of the crude, subtle, and causal resources.
# There should be maximum utilization of the physical, mental, and spiritual potentialities of the individual and collective beings.
# There should be a well-balanced adjustment among the crude, subtle, and causal utilizations.
# Utilizations vary in accordance with time, space, and form; the utilizations should be progressive.
An initial glimpse of these five principles first appeared in Sarkar's earlier work, ''Idea and Ideology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Idea and Ideology|last=Anandamurtii|first=Shrii Shrii|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=9780985758509|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The market ===
As far as Prout's values and goals differ from those of [[capitalism]] and [[communism]],&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/jar/HOH/HOH-8.pdf|title=Panimatzalam’s Voice of Transformation: An Indigenous Mayan Writing Project for Youth Activism|last=Oppenheim|first=Matt|date=|website=North Arizona University|page=144|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT in Power|last=Inayatullah|first=Sohail|publisher=Proutist Bloc India|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so does its [[Economic system|economic structure]]. Following a close analysis of the two systems, Prout’s propounder argues that these philosophies are "anti-human“ in the sense that they encourage people to relentlessly pursue material attainment, like name, fame, etc. 

Another criticism of [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberalism]] and capitalism in general is the centralization of economic power in the hands of the rich leads to the exploitation of the masses and ultimately to the denegeration of society.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT in a Nutshell part 12|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prout claims that both capitalism and communism have been built on shaky foundations, and identifies weaknesses to a point where a new market system is required.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; He heavily critiqued communism, indicating that one of the reasons the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s experiment with communism did not work, causing the eventual implosion of their political structure, is that the sovietic central planning committees ([[Gosplan]]) had too much economic decision and cohersion power in the federation (see [[Marxism–Leninism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.centrosraffa.org/public/bb6ba675-6bef-4182-bb89-339ae1f7e792.pdf|title=An analysis of the Soviet economic growth from the 1950’s to the collapse of USSR|last=Serrano|first=Franklin|last2=Mazat|first2=Numa|date=|website=Centros Raffa|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/inactive/command.pdf|title=Are Command Economies Unstable? Why did the Soviet Economy Collapse?|last=Harrison|first=Mark|date=|website=University of Warwick|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Sarkar observed aspects of [[Economic planning|market planning]] that help to create and sustain a healthy economy.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Growing a new economy|last=Bjonnes|first=Roar|last2=Sevaergrah|first2=Caroline|publisher=Inner World Books|year=2016|isbn=9781881717539|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, Proutist thought considers that planning allows the market to protect its stakeholders from the meanderings of [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal economics]] where profit-motive speaks highest.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prout.org.au/books/Self-Reliant%20Regional%20Development.pdf|title=Self-Reliant Regional proutist development|last=Ghista|first=Dhanjoo|last2=Towsey|first2=Michael|date=|website=Prout.org|page=7|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he stresses that a planning committee at a national level should only outline the broader aspects of economic development, leaving the details to be resolved by planning bodies at a local level where problems are best understood and more easily dealt with.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proutinstitute.org/download/block-level-planning/|title=Block-level planning|last=Logan|first=Ronald|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[diseconomies of scale]]). Consequently, this kind of top-down planning will leave communities, enterprises and ultimately workers with a significant level of freedom to decide their own economic future (see [[Decentralized planning (economics)|decentralized planning]]).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Prout also claims that the [[nationalization]] of enterprises is inefficient due to the larger costs and amount of bureaucracy necessary to keep state-controlled industries running.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Society part 1|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/12/economist-explains-1|title=Why nationalisation has fallen out of favour in Britain|last=|first=|date=|work=The economist|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, there are some industries that should be nationalized, operating on a "no-profit, no-loss" principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prout in a Nutshell volume 4 part 21|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key industries vital for the prosperity of society (such as transportation, energy or hospitals), claims Sarkar, should be run by the immediate government as they are too large of operations to be run conveniently by private business men.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Concerning wealth distribution among the population, Prout argues for an "optimal inequality" where the wage gap between the richer strata of society is substantially subsided.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Richard B. Freeman|Richard Freeman]], a Harvard economist, points out income inequality comes from the monopoly of power and other activities with "negative consequences" in terms of social development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/opinion/edsall-just-right-inequality.html|title=Just Right Inequality|last=Thomas|first=Edsall|date=2014|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless Prout is not in favour of total income equality, claiming that in a society where material motivation to work is absent, the willingness to strive for financial success and to thrive in the creative development of industry and society will be lost in its citizens. Therefore, Sarkar argues for the implementation of a policy allowing the most meritous in society to receive added perks for the added benefits they bring to society. It is thus theorized that the communist‘s motto of from [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|each according to his ability, to each according to his needs]] cannot work in the real world. Prout proposes instead a minimum and maximum wage, roughly attributed according to the value the work of each person brings to society. We see examples of attempts in this direction in companies like [[Mondragon Corporation|Mondragon]] or [[Whole Foods Market|Whole Foods]].

Regarding neo-liberalism, Sarkar throws a new light to the concept of Adam Smith's [[invisible hand]], where individual producers acting self-interest benefit the community as a whole. Prout claims that, unchecked, societies economic elite will disrupt the just circulation of material wealth within society. The market will then require regulatory measures so as to create a functional economic system.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Economic democracy ===
In relation to democracy, Prout argues that political democracy is not enough to free society from exploitation and what it considers extreme income inequality.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.online.southcentral.edu/students/instructors/MFMyROSEarticle.pdf|title=Living Wage and Optimal Inequality in a Sarkarian Framework|last=Friedman|first=Mark|date=2008|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Roar Bjonnes]], a known Proutist, states, "Unless we have deeper structural change – what we refer to as economic-systems change – we will never be able to solve such global and systemic problems as the environmental and inequality crises. History has demonstrated that political democracy is not enough." &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Prout, therefore, advocates an [[economic democracy]] where the decision-making power for the economic future of a community is given to its inhabitants. Economic democracy is not a new term, but Sarkar reinvents it by setting four requirements for what he considers a successful one.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Proutist Economics: Discourses on Economic Liberation|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=1992|isbn=9788172520038|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and foremost requirement is guaranteeing the minimum requirements of life to all members of society. Secondly, and following one of the five fundamental principles, Prout argues that there should be an increasing purchasing capacity for each individual, stating that local people will have to hold economic power over their socio-economic region.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Still, on this regard, Sarkar theorizes that, unlike [[capitalism]], where the production and distribution of goods are mainly decided by market competition, in a Proutistic society it should be based on necessity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The third requirement of economic democracy is the [[decentralization]] of power, giving the freedom to make economic decisions to its stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; That can be accomplished by adopting a worker-owned cooperative system &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Worker and Community: Response to Industrialization in a Nineteenth Century American City, Albany, New York, 1850-1884|last=Greenberg|first=Brian|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=978-0-88706-046-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the use of local resources (raw materials and other natural resources) for the development of the region and not merely for export.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In summary, Prout advocates a decentralized economy where self-sufficient economic zones are created and organized according to a set of predetermined conditions (see socio-economic units).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Prout claims this requirement does not express xenophobic feelings, it solely claims to be the realization that there should not be a constant outflow of local capital, where natural resources are explored by foreign investment companies that extract assets and money out of the community.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Small Is Beautiful|last=Schumacher|first=E.F.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1973|isbn=978-0-06-091630-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a [[Neohumanism|Neohumanist]] perspective, all people are free to choose where they wish to live, as long as they merge their economic interests with the ones of the local people.

Prout rests upon the concept of a tiered economic structure in which the production and distribution of goods is performed according to three distinctive business models.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; During his lifetime, he classifies and clarifies the need for these models which are; medium-scale worker-owned [[cooperative]]s, small-scale privately owned businesses and government-run large-scale key industries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Sarkar justifies this economic structure by claiming that there are fundamental strengths and weaknesses embedded in each style of business which makes them more suitable for specific industries and scales of operation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cooperatives, he understood, are desirable for the majority of enterprises.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This claim has been given since that by working together and taking hold of the means of production, cooperative workers and consumers will be safeguarded against different forms of economic exploitation, offering no scope for intermediaries to interfere with their business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A few problems solved part 9|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga publications|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, key industries vital to the development of the country and of strategic importance&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proutinstitute.org/download/prouts-3-tiered-economic-system/?wpdmdl=1652|title=PROUT’s Three-Tiered Enterprise System|last=Logan|first=Ronald|date=2015|website=PROUT institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (such as electrical utilities or the railway system), should be run by the immediate local government. He justified this idea by claiming that these industries are too complex and large scale to be run effectively by a cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discourses on PROUT|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|publisher=Ananda Marga Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Sarkar defends that small businesses can be privately owned and managed.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Enterprises with few employees such as family businesses are encouraged to be self-managed. Sarkarian thought sees that some people have economic dreams that are more individual in nature and hence not suitable to be constrained by collective interests.

In a Prout system there would be no privately owned corporations.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

=== Socio-economic units ===
A socio-economic unit, or Samaj in [[Sanskrit]], is the Proutist materialization of the collective effort to create a strong and resilient local [[community]], built on strong feelings of [[solidarity]] and [[Self-concept|self-identity]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are a few criteria that Sarkar outlined in order to build a working and cohesive socio-economic unit.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In sum, a unit should have common social and economic conditions, geographical potentialities, cultural legacy and language.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Similar to [[Bioregionalism|bioregions]], their purpose is to facilitate cooperative development, moving towards a decentralized economy, where these units are economically independent and self-reliant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Self Reliant Regional Proutistic Development|last2=Towsey|first2=Michael|last1=Ghista|first1=Dhanjoo|publisher=Prout Research Institute|year=1991|url=http://www.prout.org.au/books/Self-Reliant%20Regional%20Development.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though still guided by national and federal guidelines and laws, they should prepare its own economic plan.

Aiming to achieve maximum efficiency in the utilization of local resources, they propose to make trade across borders more balanced and mutually beneficial.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In Prout these socio-economic units would also create the necessary balance in the world's trade in so much as independently run and self-reliant communities would not need the resources from more developed economic powers seeking to exploit them.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;


=== Progress ===
From Prout's perspective, a progressive society cannot solely be measured by the wealth of a nation or it’s GDP levels. Prout recognizes the benefits of material progress, but deems them insufficient indicators of the development of human society.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PROUT - A New Paradigm for Development|last=Logan|first=Ronald|publisher=Ananda Seva Publications|year=2005|isbn=1892345048|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It argues that even though progress as its interpreted by society today has its advantages, there are negative side effects that, if unchecked, bring more harm than good. Ronald Logan, author of ''A new Paradigm of Development,'' reminds its readers that even though auto and air traffic enables us to travel at increasing speeds, bringing great convenience to travelers and commuters, it also brings air pollution, noise pollution, traffic congestion, accidental deaths, alienation from nature, etc.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

Presented with this quasi-paradoxical situation, Prout offers a concept of progress as a society that transcends material and technological development.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moving along the lines of the [[triple bottom line]] that analyzes the social, environmental and financial output of a given enterprise, Prout advocates a measure of progress that encompasses the qualities of what could be termed a "fourth bottom line",&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; characterized by the incorporation of a transcendental dimension of human life that focuses on the integrated development of the body, mind and spirit. This fourth bottom line will allow society in general and individuals in particular to develop an expanded sense of identity, allowing for a neohumanist will of inclusion, creating a society where material gains are not the [[summum bonum]] of life and allowing space to be created for people to work together in a symbiotic movement that primes for individual and collective welfare through social, cultural, as well as technological development.

Prout acknowledges that the well-being of individuals lies in the development of the collective, and that the collective depends on the development of individuals.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Therefore, in order to understand how a progressive society is to be achieved, Sarkar tries to analyze what it means for a human being to grow and develop. He concludes that physical and psychic development render little progress for a human being as they are subject to deterioration and decay.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proutglobe.org/2011/11/what-is-progress/|title=What is Progress|last=Sarkar|first=Prabhat Ranjan|date=|website=PROUT Globe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multifarious [[disease]]s that affect our body and mind, and even if we stay free of them, eventually time will turn all our physical and mental faculties of no use. Sarkar argues that the only aspect of human life that seems to be subject to no change over time is its transcendental nature, the "supra-emotional values" intrinsic to the human mind and which exacerbate human multilateral existence.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

"The deepest truths of life are an eternal fountain of inspiration. Spiritual, transpersonal development is a process of expanding one's consciousness to link with the Infinite, to reach a state of deep peace and happiness."&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://proutglobe.org/2012/10/a-new-definition-of-social-progress|title=A new definition of social progress|last=|first=|date=|website=PROUT Globe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a [[Abraham Maslow|Maslownian]] perspective, Sarkar defends the need to meet physical and mental needs before being able to engage in a journey to find that transcendental nature of the world.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; The five fundamental principles stem from this idea that society needs to provide for the basic necessities of all human beings so that they can engage in this journey of self-discovery and achieve true progress. Fundamentally, progress in society is the effort through which communities engage in the fulfillment of human needs, with the goal of achieving a transcendental existence. As a goal, transcendence will offer a fourth bottom line which ideally would propel human society into a more peaceful, inclusive and all-round more progressive existence.

==Criticism==
Prout is a relatively unknown theory.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  [[Johan Galtung]] claimed Prout is unlikely to make it into the western education system: 
&lt;blockquote&gt; ''"P. R. Sarkar was a great thinker and a great practitioner. I have chosen to honor him as a great macrohistorian, focusing on his theory of Social Cycles and their implications for world unity and peace… But, given the ethnocentrism of the USA and Europe, Sarkar will not easily make it into textbooks or courses about civilization"'' ''–'' Johan Galtung &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Economist [[Paul Erdman]], in the [[Los Angeles Times]] , described Prout as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"a strange mixture of voodoo historical theories and sound economic analysis"''&lt;ref name="Erdman" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Ravi Batra]] was one of the first economists that used the ideas of Prout in his bestseller ''[[The Great Depression of 1990]]''. In time, the theory attracted attention of people like [[Johan Galtung]], founder of the UN Institute for Peace studies who claimed that ''"Sarkar’s theory is far superior to [[Adam Smith|Adam Smith’s]] or that of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]."'' &lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Some thinkers have proclaimed the pertinence that this theory has in the context of our modern world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Who|date=May 2018}} In the foreword of ''After Capitalism: Prout’s Vision for a New World'' political philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]] wrote, ''"Alternative visions are crucial at this moment in history. Prout’s cooperative model of economic democracy, based on cardinal human values and sharing the resources of the planet for the welfare of everyone, deserves our serious consideration."'' &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In the same book historian [[Howard Zinn]] wrote, ''"After Capitalism is refreshingly original. It is spiritual and utopian while remaining grounded in reality. Its analysis is intelligent and its vision inspiring."'' &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[Leonardo Boff]], Brazilian theologian and writer, has summed up what he considers to be the importance of Prout: &lt;blockquote&gt;''"The exceptional importance of the Prout system resides in two fundamental points: its completeness and its viability. The entire system comes from a correct understanding of the human being, personal and collective, and authentic human development…" ''&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

According to a description by Terry Irving and [[Rowan Cahill]], Prout "envisages a decentralised, community-based world economy of self-sufficiency for the poor; economic democracy; small business; and limits on the accumulation of wealth."&lt;ref name=Irving/&gt; [[Sohail Inayatullah]] stated that the philosophy "attempts to balance the need for societies to create wealth and grow with the requirements for distribution."&lt;ref name=Inayatullah /&gt; [[David Skrbina]] characterized Prout as a "model of social development... which advocates a 'small is beautiful' approach to society."&lt;ref name=Skrbina /&gt;  Economics instructor Mark Friedman places Sarkar's economic thought in the tradition of Monsignor [[John A. Ryan]], [[E.F. Schumacher]] and [[Herman Daly]] in Sarkar's incorporation of spiritual values into economic goals.&lt;ref name=Friedman /&gt;

It has been characterized as a form of "progressive socialism"&lt;ref name=Ellwood /&gt; as well as a "socialist theory".&lt;ref name=Crovetto2008/&gt; 

Hans Despain noted, in [[Monthly Review]], that there are similarities between Prout and the theories of [[David Schweickart]], [[Gar Alperovitz]] and [[Richard D. Wolff]]. Particularly the focus on economic democracy and co-operatives.&lt;ref&gt;https://monthlyreview.org/2013/11/01/its-the-system-stupid/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proof-of-space''' ('''PoSpace'''), also called '''Proof-of-capacity''' ('''PoC'''), is a means of showing that one has a legitimate interest in a service (such as sending an email) by allocating a non-trivial amount of memory or disk space to solve a challenge presented by the service provider.
The concept was formulated by Dziembowski ''et al.''&lt;ref name="DziembowskiFaust2015"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last1=Dziembowski | first1=Stefan
 | last2=Faust       | first2=Sebastian

 | last4=Pietrzak    | first4=Krzysztof
 | title=Proofs of Space
 | volume=9216 |year=2015 | pages=585–605
}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2015.

Proofs of space are very similar to [[proof-of-work system|proofs of work]], except that instead of computation, storage is used. Proof-of-space is related to, but also considerably different from, memory-hard functions and proofs of retrievability.

After the release of Bitcoin, alternatives to its PoW mining mechanism were researched and PoSpace was studied in the context of [[cryptocurrency|cryptocurrencies]]. Proofs of space are seen as a fairer and greener alternative due to the general-purpose nature of storage and the lower energy cost required by storage. Several theoretical and practical implementations of PoSpace have been released and discussed, such as SpaceMint and Burstcoin.

== Concept description ==
A proof-of-space is a piece of data that a prover sends to a verifier to prove that the prover has reserved a certain amount of space. For practicality, the verification process needs to be efficient, namely, consumes a small amount of space and time. For soundness, it should be hard for the prover to pass the verification if it does not actually reserve the claimed amount of space. One way of implementing PoSpace is by using [[Graph pebbling|hard-to-pebble graphs]].&lt;ref name="DziembowskiFaust2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ren2016"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last1=Ren      | first1=Ling
 | last2=Srinivas | first2=Devadas
 | title=Proof of Space from Stacked Expanders
 | year=2016
 | url=https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/333.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verifier asks the prover to build a labeling of a hard-to-pebble graph. The prover commits to the labeling. The verifier then asks the prover to open several random locations in the commitment.

== Uses ==
Proofs of space could be used as an alternative to proofs of work in the traditional [[Client Puzzle Protocol|client puzzle]] applications such as anti-spam measures and denial of service attack prevention. Proof-of-Space has also been used for malware detection, by determining whether the L1 cache of a processor is empty (e.g., has enough space to evaluate the PoSpace routine without cache misses) or contains a routine that resisted being evicted.&lt;ref name="JakobssonStewart13"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jakobsson|first1=Markus|title=Mobile Malware: Why the Traditional AV Paradigm is Doomed, and How to Use Physics to Detect Undesirable Routines, BlackHat|last2=Stewart|first2=Guy|year=2013|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4194/e4f5fccaac653f00ebb80f51f01e6c7fd80a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markus Jakobsson [https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/031.pdf Secure Remote Attestation] ''Cryptology ePrint Archive.'' Retrieved 8 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proofs of space have been developed further in several concept papers and in one live cryptocurrency implementation.

=== Implementations ===

==== Burstcoin ====
Proof of space or Proof of capacity is used in the Burstcoin cryptocurrency founded in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://us.newsbtc.com/burstcoin-celebrates-birthday-with-release-of-new-energy-efficient-hdd-mining-wallet/|title=BURSTCOIN Celebrates Birthday With Release Of New Energy Efficient HDD Mining Wallet|accessdate=1 November 2016|publisher=NewsBTC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proof of capacity consumes disk space rather than computing resources to mine a block. Unlike PoW, where the miners keep changing the block header and hash to find the solution, the Proof of capacity implementation in Burstcoin generates random solutions, also called plots, using the Shabal cryptographic algorithm in advance and stores it on hard drives. This stage is called plotting and it may take days or even weeks depending on the storage capacity of the drive. In the next stage - mining, miners match their solutions to the most recent puzzle and the node with the fastest solution gets to mine the next block.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wahab|first=Abdul|last2=Waqas|first2=Memood|date=October 2018|title=Survey of Consensus Protocols|url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1810/1810.03357.pdf|journal=Survey of Consensus Protocols|volume=|pages= 6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-capacity-cryptocurrency.asp|title=BREAKING DOWN 'Proof of Capacity (Cryptocurrency)'|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salimitari|first=Mehrdad|last2=Chatterjee|first2=Mainak|date=September 2018|title=An Overview of Blockchain and Consensus Protocols for IoT Networks|url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.05613|journal=An Overview of Blockchain and Consensus Protocols for IoT Networks|pages=III-G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Concepts ===

==== SpaceMint ====
In 2015, a paper proposed a cryptocurrency called SpaceMint.&lt;ref name="SpaceMint"&gt;Park et al. [https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/528 SpaceMint: A Cryptocurrency Based on Proofs of Space.] ''Cryptology ePrint Archive.'' Retrieved 31 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It attempts to solve some of the practical design problems associated with the pebbling-based PoSpace schemes. In using PoSpace for decentralized cryptocurrency, the protocol has to be adapted to work in a non-interactive protocol since each individual in the network has to behave as a verifier.&lt;ref name="SpaceMint" /&gt;

==== Chia ====
In 2018, a proposed cryptocurrency Chia presented two papers presenting a new protocol based on proof of space&lt;ref name="Abusalah2017"&gt;

[[File:Mahmud in robe from the caliph.jpg|thumb|[[Mahmud of Ghazni]] dons a robe of honour sent by Caliph [[al-Qadir]]]]
A '''robe of honour''' ([[Arabic]]: ''khilʿa'' or ''tashrīf'') was a term designating rich garments given by medieval and early modern Islamic rulers to subjects as tokens of honour, often as part of a ceremony of appointment to a public post, or as a token of confirmation or acceptance of vassalage of a subordinate ruler. They were usually produced in government factories and decorated with the inscribed bands known as ''[[tiraz|ṭirāz]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11671">'''Screen reading''' is the act of [[Reading (process)|reading]] a [[Written language|text]] on a [[computer screen]], [[smartphone]], [[e-book reader]], etc. It is often contrasted with the act of reading a text on [[paper]], in particular a [[Printing|print]]ed text.

== Discovery ==
[[Louis Émile Javal]], a French ophthalmologist and founder of an ophthalmology laboratory in Paris is credited with the introduction of the term [[saccades]] into eye movement research. Javal discovered that while reading, one’s eyes tend to jump across the text in saccades, and stop intermittently along each line in [[fixation (visual)|fixations]].&lt;ref name="Javal"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wade | first1 = Nicholas J | year = 2010 | title = Pioneers of Eye Movement Research | journal = i-Perception | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 33–68 | pmc=3563053 | pmid=23396982 | doi=10.1068/i0389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the lack of technology at the time, naked-eye observations were used to observe [[eye movement in reading|eye movement]], until later in the late 19th and mid-20th century [[eye tracking|eye-tracking]] experiments were conducted in an attempt to discover a pattern regarding eye fixations while reading.&lt;ref name="Javal"/&gt;

== Research ==

=== F-Pattern ===
In a 1997 study conducted by Jakob Nielsen, a leading web usability expert who co-founded usability consulting company [[Nielsen Norman Group]] with [[Donald Norman]], it was discovered that generally people read 25% slower on a computer screen in comparison with a printed page.&lt;ref name=Beam&gt;{{cite news |title=I screen, you screen, we all screen |author=[[Alex Beam]] |date=2009-06-19 |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2009/06/19/paper_vs_computer_screen/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers state that this is only true for when reading on an older type computer screen with a low-scanrate.

In an additional study done in 2006, Nielsen also discovered that people read Web pages in an '''F-shaped pattern''' that consists of two horizontal stripes followed by a vertical stripe.&lt;ref name="F-Shape"&gt;{{cite web |title=F-Shaped Pattern For Reading Web Content |author=[[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] |date=2006-04-17 |url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/reading_pattern.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had 232 participants fitted with eye-tracking cameras to trace their eye movements as they read online texts and webpages. The findings showed that people do not read the text on webpages word-by-word, but instead generally read horizontally across the top of the webpage, then in a second horizontal movement slightly lower on the page, and lastly  scan vertically down the left side of the screen.&lt;ref name="F-Shape"/&gt;

The Software Usability Research Laboratory at Wichita State University did a subsequent study in 2007 testing eye gaze patterns while searching versus browsing a website [http://usabilitynews.org/eye-gaze-patterns-while-searching-vs-browsing-a-website/], and the results confirmed that users appeared to follow Nielsen’s ‘F’ pattern while browsing and searching through text-based pages.&lt;ref&gt;Shrestha, Sav, and Kelsi Lenz. [http://usabilitynews.org/eye-gaze-patterns-while-searching-vs-browsing-a-website/ "Eye Gaze Patterns while Searching vs. Browsing a Website"], ''SURL'', Jan. 14, 2007, retrieved Feb. 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of German researchers conducted a study that examined the Web browsing behavior of 25 participants over the course of around one hundred days.The researchers concluded that "browsing is a rapidly interactive activity,"[https://ccit.college.columbia.edu/sites/ccit/files/weinreich-web-use-study.pdf] and that Web pages are mostly viewed for 10 seconds or less.&lt;ref&gt;H. Weinreich et al. [https://ccit.college.columbia.edu/sites/ccit/files/weinreich-web-use-study.pdf "Not Quite the Average: An Empirical Study of Web Use"], ''ACM Transactions on the Web'', Vol. 2, No. 1, Article 5, Feb. 2008, retrieved Feb. 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Nielsen analyzed this data in 2008 and found that, on average, users read 20-28% of the content on a webpage.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Jakob. [https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-little-do-users-read/ "How Little Do Users Read?"], ''Nielsen Norman Group'', May 6, 2008, retrieved Feb. 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Google Golden Triangle ===
A similar study, using search results from the [[Google search engine]], determined that readers primarily looked at a triangular area of the top and left side of the screen.  This corresponds to the Nielsen F-shaped pattern, and was dubbed the '''[[Golden Triangle (Internet Marketing)|Google Golden Triangle]]'''.&lt;ref name="EyetoolsGGTArch"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eyetools.com/research_google_eyetracking_heatmap.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130113060242/http://eyetools.com/research_google_eyetracking_heatmap.html |title=Google Search's Golden Triangle |publisher=Eyetools |archivedate=13 January 2013 |accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent 2014 Meditative study &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediative.com/eye-tracking-google-through-the-years/ "Keeping an eye on Google – Eye tracking SERPs through the years"]&lt;/ref&gt; showed evidence of the declination of the Golden Triangle phenomenon since 2005 as users view more search result listings than before.

== Comparisons to Reading Printed Text ==
Since the first notion of screen reading, many studies have been performed to discern any differences between reading off of an electronic device and reading off of a paper.  In a 2013 study, a group of 72 high school students in Norway were randomly assigned into one of two groups: one that read using [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] files on a computer and one that used standard paper.  The students were put through various tests involving reading-comprehension and vocabulary. The results indicated that those who read using the PDF files performed much worse than those reading off of a paper. A conclusion was reached that certain aspects of screen reading, such as scrolling, can impede comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mangen|first=Anne|last2=Walgermo|first2=Bente R.|last3=Brønnick|first3=Kolbjørn|date=2013-01-01|title=Reading linear texts on paper versus computer screen: Effects on reading comprehension|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035512001127|journal=International Journal of Educational Research|volume=58|pages=61–68|doi=10.1016/j.ijer.2012.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, not all experiments have concluded that reading from a digitized screen can be detrimental.  The same year, another experiment was conducted on 90 undergraduates at a college in Western New York involving paper reading, computer reading, and e-book reading. Like the children in the Norwegian experiment, the students were tested for comprehension upon reading a number of passages: five focused around facts and information and the other five based on narratives.  No significant difference was found between any of the different forms of reading for either type of passage.  However, the researchers noted that due to the participants being college students who were accustomed to using technology, they may react differently to reading on electronic devices than older individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Margolin|first=Sara J.|last2=Driscoll|first2=Casey|last3=Toland|first3=Michael J.|last4=Kegler|first4=Jennifer Little|date=2013-07-01|title=E-readers, Computer Screens, or Paper: Does Reading Comprehension Change Across Media Platforms?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.2930/abstract|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|language=en|volume=27|issue=4|pages=512–519|doi=10.1002/acp.2930|issn=1099-0720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in 2014 by Tirza Lauterman and Rakefet Ackerman allowed subjects the option to choose between reading digitally or reading printed pages.  The results found that those who chose to read digitally performed worse than those who used print.  However, by practicing with PDF files, subjects that preferred to read on computers were able to overcome what researchers labeled as “screen inferiority” and managed to score just as well as paper readers, who did not improve with practice.  Lauterman and Ackerman concluded that the study supported the idea that screen reading is shallower than paper reading, but that with practice the shallowness can be removed as an impediment.  No conclusion has yet been reached among professionals regarding whether or not reading on a screen is significantly different than reading printed text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lauterman|first=Tirza|last2=Ackerman|first2=Rakefet|date=2014-06-01|title=Overcoming screen inferiority in learning and calibration|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214001149|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=35|pages=455–463|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.02.046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Critics have voiced concerns about screen reading, though some have taken a more positive stance. [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] believes that we are transitioning from "book fluency to screen fluency, from literacy to visuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Becoming Screen Literate |author=[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]] |date=2008-11-21 |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/23/magazine/23wwln-future-t.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Rosen. "[http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/people-of-the-screen People of the Screen]", ''The New Atlantis'', Number 22, Fall 2008, pp. 20–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Mangen holds that because of the materialist nature of a printed book the reader is more engaged with a text, while the opposite is true with a digital text in which the reader is engaged in a "shallower, less focused way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hypertext fiction reading: haptics and immersion |author=Anne Mangen |year=2008 |journal=Journal of Research in Reading |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=404–419 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9817.2008.00380.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Online Literacy Is a Lesser Kind: Slow reading counterbalances Web skimming |author=Mark Bauerlein |date=2008-09-19 |journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |volume=54 |issue=31 |pages=Page B7 |url=http://chronicle.com/free/v55/i04/04b01001.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas G. Carr|Nicholas Carr]], author of ''[[The Shallows (book)|The Shallows]]'', says that “the ability to skim text is every bit as important as the ability to read deeply. What is… troubling, is that skimming is becoming our dominant mode of reading” (138).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carr |first=Nicholas |date=2010 |title=The Shallows: What the Internet Is Doing to Our Brains |url= |location=New York |publisher=W.W.

The occurrence of CVS has grown greatly over the past few years, effecting a large majority of American workers who spend over three hours a day on computers in some form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blehm|first=Clayton|last2=Vishnu|first2=Seema|last3=Khattak|first3=Ashbala|last4=Mitra|first4=Shrabanee|last5=Yee|first5=Richard W.|date=2005-05-01|title=Computer Vision Syndrome: A Review|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039625705000093|journal=Survey of Ophthalmology|volume=50|issue=3|pages=253–262|doi=10.1016/j.survophthal.2005.02.008|pmid=15850814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, boys were asked the circumstances in which their first [[ejaculation]] occurred.  Most commonly this occurred via a [[nocturnal emission]], with a significant number experiencing semenarche via [[masturbation]].  Less commonly, the first ejaculation occurred during [[sexual intercourse]] with a partner.&lt;ref name="context"&gt;A Study of White Middle-Class Adolescent Boys' Responses to "Semenarche" (The First Ejaculation), James H.

'''Systems neuroscience''' is a subdiscipline of [[neuroscience]] and [[systems biology]] that studies the structure and function of neural circuits and systems.  It is an umbrella term, encompassing a number of areas of study concerned with how [[neuron|nerve cells]] behave when connected together to form [[neural pathway]]s, [[neural circuit]]s, and larger [[large scale brain networks|brain networks]].  At this level of analysis, neuroscientists study how different neural circuits analyze sensory information, form perceptions of the external world, make decisions, and execute movements. Researchers in systems neuroscience are concerned with the relation between [[molecular neuroscience|molecular]] and [[cellular neuroscience|cellular]] approaches to understanding brain structure and function, as well as with the study of high-level mental functions such as [[cognitive linguistics|language]], [[memory]], and [[Consciousness#Cognitive psychology and cognitive neuroscience|self-awareness]] (which are the purview of [[behavioral neuroscience|behavioral]] and [[cognitive neuroscience|cognitive]] neuroscience).  Systems neuroscientists typically employ techniques for understanding networks of neurons as they are seen to function, by way of [[electrophysiology]] using either [[single-unit recording]] or multi-electrode recording, [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), and [[Positron emission tomography|PET scans]]. The term is commonly used in an educational framework:  a common sequence of graduate school neuroscience courses consists of cellular/molecular neuroscience for the first semester, then systems neuroscience for the second semester.  It is also sometimes used to distinguish a subdivision within a neuroscience department at an academic institution.

'''Thermochemistry''' is the study of the heat energy associated with [[chemical reaction]]s and/or physical transformations.  A reaction may release or absorb energy, and a phase change may do the same, such as in [[melting]] and [[boiling]].  Thermochemistry focuses on these energy changes, particularly on the [[system]]'s energy exchange with its [[surroundings]].  Thermochemistry is useful in predicting reactant and product quantities throughout the course of a given reaction. In combination with [[entropy]] determinations, it is also used to predict whether a reaction is spontaneous or non-spontaneous, favorable or unfavorable.

[[Endothermic process|Endothermic reactions]] absorb heat, while  [[Exothermic process|exothermic reactions]] release heat.  Thermochemistry coalesces the concepts of thermodynamics with the concept of energy in the form of chemical bonds.  The subject commonly includes calculations of such quantities as [[heat capacity]], [[heat of combustion]], [[heat of formation]], [[enthalpy]], [[entropy]], [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], and [[calorie]]s.
[[Image:Ice-calorimeter.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The world's first '''ice-calorimeter''', used in the winter of 1782-83, by [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]], to determine the [[heat]] evolved in various [[chemical change]]s; calculations which were based on [[Joseph Black]]’s prior discovery of [[latent heat]].  These experiments mark the foundation of '''thermochemistry'''.]]

==History==
Thermochemistry rests on two generalizations.  Stated in modern terms, they are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Perrot, Pierre | title=A to Z of Thermodynamics | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1998 | isbn=0-19-856552-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Antoine Lavoisier|Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace's]] law (1780): The energy change accompanying any transformation is equal and opposite to energy change accompanying the reverse process.&lt;ref&gt;See page 290 of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=En83AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA290&amp;lpg=PA290&amp;dq=Lavoisier+and+Laplace%E2%80%99s+law&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=08EZ8FHE8U&amp;sig=jTEDieLkvYpaohtBFh0u9VsdavIM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=xWpnSqubB5SCswPj08jlDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9 Outlines of Theoretical Chemistry]'' by Frederick Hutton Getman (1918)&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Hess' law]] (1840): The energy change accompanying any transformation is the same whether the process occurs in one step or many.

These statements preceded the [[first law of thermodynamics]] (1845) and helped in its formulation.

Lavoisier, Laplace and [[Germain Henri Hess|Hess]] also investigated [[specific heat]] and [[latent heat]], although it was [[Joseph Black]] who made the most important contributions to the development of latent energy changes.

[[Gustav Kirchhoff]] showed in 1858 that the variation of the heat of reaction is given by the difference in [[heat capacity]] between products and reactants: dΔH / dT = ΔC&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. Integration of this equation permits the evaluation of the heat of reaction at one temperature from measurements at another temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith J. Laidler|Laidler K.J.]] and Meiser J.H., "Physical Chemistry" (Benjamin/Cummings 1982), p.62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Atkins|Atkins P.]] and de Paula J., "Atkins' Physical Chemistry" (8th edn, W.H. Freeman 2006), p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calorimetry==
The measurement of heat changes is performed using [[calorimetry]], usually an enclosed chamber within which the change to be examined occurs. The temperature of the chamber is monitored either using a [[thermometer]] or [[thermocouple]], and the temperature plotted against time to give a graph from which fundamental quantities can be calculated. Modern calorimeters are frequently supplied with automatic devices to provide a quick read-out of information, one example being the [[differential scanning calorimeter]] (DSC).

==Systems==
Several thermodynamic definitions are very useful in thermochemistry. A system is the specific portion of the universe that is being studied. Everything outside the system is considered the surroundings or environment. A system may be:
* a (completely) [[isolated system]] which can exchange neither energy nor matter with the surroundings, such as an insulated [[bomb calorimeter]]
* a [[thermally isolated system]] which can exchange mechanical work but not heat or matter, such as an insulated closed [[piston]] or [[balloon]]
* a [[mechanically isolated system]] which can exchange heat but not mechanical work or matter, such as an '''un'''insulated [[bomb calorimeter]]
* a [[closed system]] which can exchange energy but not matter, such as an '''un'''insulated closed piston or balloon
* an [[Thermodynamic system#Open system|open system]] which it can exchange both matter and energy with the surroundings, such as a pot of boiling water

==Processes==
A system undergoes a process when one or more of its properties changes. A process relates to the change of state. An '''[[Isothermal process|isothermal]]''' (same-temperature) process occurs when temperature of the system remains constant. An '''[[Isobaric process|isobaric]]''' (same-pressure) process occurs when the pressure of the system remains constant. A process is '''[[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]]''' when no heat exchange occurs.

'''Toxicology''' is a [[discipline (academia)|discipline]], overlapping with [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[pharmacology]], and [[medicine]], that involves the study of the [[adverse effect]]s of [[chemical substance]]s on living [[organism]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toxicologysource.com/whatistoxicology.html |title=What is Toxicology |last=Schrager |first=TF |date=October 4, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310233247/http://www.toxicologysource.com/whatistoxicology.html |archivedate=March 10, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice of [[diagnosis|diagnosing]] and [[therapy|treating]] exposures to [[toxin]]s and [[toxicant]]s. The [[dose–response relationship|relationship between dose and its effects on the exposed organism]] is of high significance in toxicology. Factors that influence chemical [[toxicity]] include the dosage (and whether it is acute or chronic), route of exposure, species, age, sex, and environment. '''Toxicologists''' are experts on [[poison]]s and [[poisoning]].

== History ==
[[File:Mathieu Joseph Bonaventure Orfila.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lithograph]] of [[Mathieu Orfila]]]]

[[Dioscorides]], a Greek physician in the court of the Roman emperor [[Nero]], made the first attempt to classify plants according to their toxic and therapeutic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodgson |first=Ernest |year=2010 |title=A Textbook of Modern Toxicology |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |page=10 |isbn=978-0-470-46206-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] wrote the ''Book on Poisons'' in the 9th or 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levey |first=Martin |year=1966 |title=Medieval Arabic Toxicology: The Book on Poisons of ibn Wahshiyya and its Relation to Early Native American and Greek Texts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed up in 1360 by [[Khagendra Mani Darpana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Taxonomical outlines of bio-diversity of Karnataka in a 14th century Kannada toxicology text Khagendra Mani Darpana|first1=Sathyanarayana|last1=Bhat|first2=Kumaraswamy|last2=Udupa|date=1 August 2013|journal=Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Biomedicine|volume=3|issue=8|pages=668–672 |doi=10.1016/S2221-1691(13)60134-3|pmid=23905027|pmc=3703563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mathieu Orfila]] is considered the modern father of toxicology, having given the subject its first formal treatment in 1813 in his ''Traité des poisons'', also called ''Toxicologie générale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/biographies/orfila.html |publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine |title=Biography of Mathieu Joseph Bonaventure Orfila (1787–1853)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1850, [[Jean Stas]] became the first person to successfully isolate plant poisons from human tissue. This allowed him to identify the use of [[nicotine]] as a poison in the famous Bocarmé murder case, providing the evidence needed to convict the Belgian Count [[Hippolyte Visart de Bocarmé]] of killing his brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wennig|first=Robert|date=April 2009|title=Back to the roots of modern analytical toxicology: Jean Servais Stas and the Bocarmé murder case|journal=[[Drug Testing and Analysis (journal)|Drug Testing and Analysis]]|volume=1|issue=4|pages=153–155|pmid = 20355192|doi = 10.1002/dta.32 | oclc =| id = | url = | language = | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theophrastus Phillipus Auroleus Bombastus von Hohenheim (1493–1541) (also referred to as [[Paracelsus]], from his belief that his studies were above or beyond the work of [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus|Celsus]]&amp;nbsp;– a Roman physician from the first century) is also considered "the father" of toxicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Pesticide/Paracelsus-Dose-ToxicologyOct01.htm |title=Paracelsus Dose Response in the Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology WILLIAM C KRIEGER / Academic Press Oct01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with the classic toxicology maxim, "''Alle Dinge sind Gift und nichts ist ohne Gift; allein die Dosis macht, dass ein Ding kein Gift ist.''" which translates as, "All things are poisonous and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not poisonous." This is often condensed to: "[[The dose makes the poison]]" or in Latin "Sola dosis facit venenum".&lt;ref name=Ottoboni&gt;{{cite book| last = Ottoboni |first=M. Alice | title = The dose makes the poison : a plain-language guide to toxicology | publisher = Van Nostrand Reinhold | location = New York, N.Y | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-442-00660-0 | edition = 2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}}

== Basic principles==

The goal of toxicity assessment is to identify [[adverse effects]] of a substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Committee on Risk Assessment of Hazardous Air Pollutants, Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council |title= Science and judgement in risk assessment |publisher=The National Academic Press |location= |year=1994|page=56 |isbn= 978-0-309-07490-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Adverse effects depend on two main factors: i) routes of exposure (oral, inhalation, or dermal) and ii) dose (duration and concentration of exposure).  To explore dose, substances are tested in both acute and chronic models.&lt;ref name= d1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.epa.gov/region8/human-health-toxicity-assessment|publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agencies|title=Human Health Toxicity Assessment}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Generally, different sets of experiments are conducted to determine whether a substance causes cancer and to examine other forms of toxicity.&lt;ref name=d1/&gt;

Factors that influence chemical toxicity:&lt;ref name=Ottoboni/&gt;
*Dosage
**Both large single exposures (acute) and continuous small exposures (chronic) are studied.
*Route of exposure
**Ingestion, inhalation or skin absorption
*Other factors
**Species
**Age
**Sex
**Health
**Environment
**Individual characteristics

== Testing methods ==
Toxicity experiments may be conducted ''[[in vivo]]'' (using the whole animal) or ''[[in vitro]]'' (testing on isolated cells or tissues), or ''[[in silico]]'' (in a computer simulation).&lt;ref name=a1&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bruin|first=Yuri. et. al|date=2009|title=Testing methods and toxicity assessment (Including alternatives)|journal=[[Academic Press]]|volume=|issue=|pages=497–514|pmid = |doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-373593-5.00060-4| oclc =| id = | url = | language = | laysummary = | laysource = | laydate = | quote =|isbn=9780123735935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-human animals===
The classic experimental tool of toxicology is testing on non-human animals.&lt;ref name=Ottoboni/&gt; An example of a model organism is ''[[Galleria mellonella]],'' which can replace small mammals to study toxicology in vivo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harding|first=Clare R.|last2=Schroeder|first2=Gunnar N.|last3=Collins|first3=James W.|last4=Frankel|first4=Gad|date=2013-11-22|title=Use of ''Galleria mellonella'' as a Model Organism to Study ''Legionella pneumophila'' Infection|url=https://www.jove.com/video/50964/use-galleria-mellonella-as-model-organism-to-study-legionella|journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments|issue=81|pages=50964|doi=10.3791/50964|pmid=24299965|issn=1940-087X|pmc=3923569}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, such [[animal testing]] provides information that is not available by other means about how substances function in a living organism.&lt;ref name=SocTox2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toxicology.org/ms/air1.asp |publisher=Society of Toxicology |title=The importance of animal in research |date=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207062218/http://www.toxicology.org/ms/air1.asp |archivedate=2014-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of non-human animals for toxicology testing is opposed by some organisations for reasons of animal welfare, and it has been restricted or banned under some circumstances in certain regions, such as the testing of cosmetics in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Kanter | first = James | date = March 11, 2013 | title = E.U. Bans Cosmetics With Animal-Tested Ingredients | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/11/business/global/eu-to-ban-cosmetics-with-animal-tested-ingredients.html | work = New York Times |access-date=October 26, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative testing methods ===
While testing in animal models remains as a method of estimating human effects, there are both ethical and technical concerns with animal testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date = 8 September 2011 | title = Existing Non-animal Alternatives | publisher = AltTox.org | url = http://alttox.org/ttrc/existing-alternatives/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1950s, the field of toxicology has sought to reduce or eliminate animal testing under the rubric of "Three Rs" - reduce the number of experiments with animals to the minimum necessary; refine experiments to cause less suffering, and replace ''in vivo'' experiments with other types, or use more simple forms of life when possible.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.toxicology.org/script/admin/toxtopics/114517_AM_TT3_InVitro_SOT.pdf|title=Alternative toxicity test methods: reducing, refining and replacing animal use for safety testing |publisher= Society of Toxicology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan M. Goldberg. [http://altweb.jhsph.edu/altex/27_2/rPL7_Goldberg2.pdf The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique: Is It Relevant Today?] Altex 27, Special Issue 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer modeling is an example of alternative testing methods;  using computer models of chemicals and proteins, [[Structure–activity relationship|structure-activity relationships]] can be determined, and chemical structures that are likely to bind to, and interfere with, proteins with essential functions, can be identified.&lt;ref name=c1&gt;{{cite book |author1=Leeuwen van.C.J. |author2=Vermeire T.G. |title= Risk assessment of chemicals: An introduction |publisher=Springer |location=New York |year=2007|pages=451–479 |isbn=978-1-4020-6102-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This work requires expert knowledge in molecular modeling and statistics together with expert judgment in chemistry, biology and toxicology.&lt;ref name=c1/&gt;

In 2007 the American NGO [[National Academy of Sciences]] published a report called "Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy" which opened with a statement: "Change often involves a pivotal event that builds on previous history and opens the door to a new era.

It is poised to take advantage of the revolutions in biology and biotechnology.

== Dose response complexities ==
Most chemicals display a classic dose response curve&amp;nbsp;– at a low dose (below a threshold), no effect is observed.&lt;ref name=Ottoboni/&gt;{{rp|80}}  Some show a phenomenon known as sufficient challenge&amp;nbsp;– a small exposure produces animals that "grow more rapidly, have better general appearance and coat quality, have fewer tumors, and live longer than the control animals".{{sfn|Ottoboni|1991|pp=83-85}}
A few chemicals have no well-defined safe level of exposure.  These are treated with special care.  Some chemicals are subject to
bioaccumulation as they are stored in rather than being excreted from the body;&lt;ref name=Ottoboni/&gt;{{rp|85–90}} these also receive special consideration.

Several measures are commonly used to describe toxic dosages according to the degree of effect on an organism or a population, and some are specifically defined by various laws or organizational usage.  These include:
* LD50 = [[Median lethal dose]], a dose that will kill 50% of an exposed population
* NOEL = No Observed Effect Level, the highest dose known to show no effect
* NOAEL = No Observed Adverse Effect Level, the highest dose known to show no adverse effects
* PEL = Permissible Exposure Limit, the highest concentration permitted under US [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] regulations
* STEL = Short-Term Exposure Limit, the highest concentration permitted for short periods of time, in general 15–30 minutes
* TWA = Time-Weighted Average, the average amount of an agent's concentration over a specified period of time, usually 8 hours.
*TTC = Threshold of Toxicological Concern have been established for the constituents of [[tobacco smoke]]&lt;ref name="TalhoutSchulz2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Talhout|first1=Reinskje|last2=Schulz|first2=Thomas|last3=Florek|first3=Ewa|last4=Van Benthem|first4=Jan|last5=Wester|first5=Piet|last6=Opperhuizen|first6=Antoon|title=Hazardous Compounds in Tobacco Smoke|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=8|issue=12|year=2011|pages=613–628|issn=1660-4601|doi=10.3390/ijerph8020613|pmid=21556207|pmc=3084482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Toxicology as a profession ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
A '''toxicologist''' is a scientist or medical personnel who specializes in the study of symptoms, mechanisms, treatments and detection of [[venom]]s and [[toxin]]s; especially the [[poison]]ing of people.

=== Requirements ===
To work as a toxicologist one should obtain a degree in toxicology or a related degree like [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[pharmacology]] or [[biochemistry]]. Bachelor's degree programs in toxicology cover the chemical makeup of toxins and their effects on biochemistry, physiology and ecology. After introductory life science courses are complete, students typically enroll in labs and apply toxicology principles to research and other studies. Advanced students delve into specific sectors, like the pharmaceutical industry or law enforcement, which apply methods of toxicology in their work. The [[Society of Toxicology]] (SOT) recommends that undergraduates in postsecondary schools that don't offer a bachelor's degree in toxicology consider attaining a degree in biology or chemistry.  Additionally, the SOT advises aspiring toxicologists to take statistics and mathematics courses, as well as gain laboratory experience through lab courses, student research projects and internships.

=== Duties ===
Toxicologists perform many different duties including research in the academic, nonprofit and industrial fields, product safety evaluation, consulting, public service and legal regulation. In order to research and assess the effects of chemicals, toxicologists perform carefully designed studies and experiments. These experiments help identify the specific amount of a chemical that may cause harm and potential risks of being near or using products that contain certain chemicals. Research projects may range from assessing the effects of toxic pollutants on the environment to evaluating how the human immune system responds to chemical compounds within pharmaceutical drugs. While the basic duties of toxicologists are to determine the effects of chemicals on organisms and their surroundings, specific job duties may vary based on industry and employment. For example, forensic toxicologists may look for toxic substances in a crime scene, whereas aquatic toxicologists may analyze the toxicity level of water bodies.

=== Compensation ===
The salary for jobs in toxicology is dependent on several factors, including level of schooling, specialization, experience. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) notes that jobs for biological scientists, which generally include toxicologists, were expected to increase by 21% between 2008 and 2018. The BLS notes that this increase could be due to research and development growth in biotechnology, as well as budget increases for basic and medical research in biological science.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The word ''toxicology'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|t|ɒ|k|s|ᵻ|ˈ|k|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}}) is a [[classical compound|neoclassical compound]] from [[New Latin]], first attested circa 1799,&lt;ref name="MWU"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Unabridged Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/unabridged/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the combining forms ''[[wikt:toxico-#Prefix|toxico-]]'' + ''[[wikt:-logy#Suffix|-logy]]'', which in turn come from the [[Ancient Greek]] words [[wikt:τοξικός#Ancient Greek|τοξικός]] ''toxikos'', "poisonous", and [[wikt:λόγος#Ancient Greek|λόγος]] ''logos'', "subject matter").

[[Image:Christian Aid campaigners with Hilary Benn and Andrew Smith 20050127.jpg|thumb|Activists from [[Christian Aid]] lobbying for Trade Justice.]]

'''Trade justice''' is a campaign by [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisations]], plus efforts by other actors, to change the rules and practices of [[International trade|world trade]] in order to promote fairness. These organizations include consumer groups, trade unions, faith groups, [[aid agency|aid agencies]] and environmental groups.

The organizations campaigning for trade justice posit this concept in opposition to [[free trade]], the advocates of which often also claim pro-poor outcomes.  Trade justice advocates argue that truly free trade does not and will never exist, and that governmental policies on trade should be in the public interest, rather than the interest of wealthy entities who try to influence trade negotiation to benefit their individual interests. Advocates of trade justice argue that growing inequity and serious gaps in [[social justice]], and the global export of [[terrorism]], are symptoms of an economic system that permits harms to be exported to other countries, while importing their goods.  They point to [[extinction]], [[deforestation]], [[social unrest]], as consequences of [[globalisation]], and in particular of an "unfair" globalisation. In the past, the responses sought by critics of the international trade system included various penalties on "unfair" goods. This argument generally made little headway against the long-term movement towards [[free trade]]; imposition of penalties for "[[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]]" was sometimes motivated by domestic political reasons such as the United States imposition of [[steel tariffs]] in 2001).

Today, the trade justice movement concentrates more on the abolition of [[agricultural subsidy|agricultural subsidies]] and dumping, and to a much lesser extent on offsetting penalties on "unfair" goods. Indeed, although there are many who are still critical of free trade in general, there is a trend towards campaigning against what is seen as [[hypocrisy]] by [[developed countries]] in using [[protectionism]] against the poorest countries, especially in agricultural products, while requiring them to leave their own producers without protection.

== Trade justice movement ==

The [[Trade Justice Movement]] in the UK was the first formal coalition of groups to use the term "trade justice" (partly because in the UK, "[[fair trade]]" usually refers to [[Fairtrade certification]] and is a consumer model of change rather than an overtly political movement calling for government action). The term trade justice has been widely adopted internationally by campaign groups, for example by the over 100 national platforms of the [[Global Call to Action Against Poverty]] where it is one of the four main demands. In many countries "[[fair trade]]" is used as well as or instead of "trade justice".

The global institutions that are most often targeted in trade justice campaigns against the alleged injustices of the current international trade system are the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[World Bank]] (WB). Campaigners also lobby their own governments with the intention of creating pressure on them to prioritise poverty reduction when making international trade rules. In trading blocs such as the [[European Union]] (EU), the campaigns seek to influence policy across a number of member state governments.

"Trade Justice" and "Fair Trade" were originally used by those supporting [[social justice]] and the alleviation of the intense [[poverty]] found in many developing nations. They contrasted "fair trade" with 'unfair' [[international trade]] practices. It is associated particularly with [[Labor union|labour unions]] and [[Environmentalism|environmentalists]], in their criticism of disparities between the protections for [[Capital (economics)|capital]] versus those for labour and the environment. The use of the term has expanded beyond campaigns to reform current trading practices, and the major institutions such as the [[World Trade Organization]] which embody them. Now it has become a movement to allow consumers to choose ''not'' to participate in these practices. [[Fairtrade labelling]] or "Fairtrade certification" allows [[consumer]]s to identify goods especially commodities such as [[coffee]], that meet certain agreed standards of fairness.

== Issues ==

Academics such as [[Thomas Alured Faunce]] argue that the insertion of a [[constructive ambiguity]] such as valuing [[innovation]] in [[bilateral trade agreements]] (and then according [[normative]] and ongoing [[lobbying]] power to such textual negotiating truces by formally linking them with [[non-violation nullification of benefits]] provisions) may undermine democratic [[sovereignty]] with regard to construction of domestic policy, particularly in areas such as the environment and public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Faunce | first = Thomas Alured | author-link = Thomas Alured Faunce | title = Reference pricing for pharmaceuticals: is the Australia–United States free trade agreement affecting Australia’s pharmaceutical benefits scheme? | journal = Med J Aust | year = 2007 | volume = 187 | pages = 240–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Faunce | first1 = TA | last2 = Neville | first2 = W | last3 = Anton | first3 = Wasson A | contribution = Non Violation Nullification of Benefit Claims: Opportunities and Dilemmas in a Rule-Based WTO Dispute Settlement System | editor-last = Bray | editor-first = M | title = Ten Years of WTO Dispute Settlement: Australian Perspectives | publisher = Office of Trade Negotiations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade | place = Commonwealth of Australia | pages = 123–40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This view is strenuously contested by trade law officials and many domestic policy makers.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}

"The mostly widely referred to demand of trade justice campaigners is access to the markets of developed countries or rich countries. When developing countries export to developed country markets, they often face tariff barriers that can be as much as four times higher than those encountered by developed countries. Poverty claims that those barriers cost poor countries $100 billion a year – twice as much as they receive in aid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalfootprints.org/trade|title=Trade footprint|last=|first=|date=|website=HEC Global Learning Centre|access-date=15 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most trade justice campaigners focus in some way on the agricultural subsidies of rich countries that make it difficult for farmers in poor countries to compete.  For example, they argue that the European Union's agricultural export subsidies encourage [[overproduction]] of goods such as [[tomato]]es or [[sugar]], which are then sold cheaply or 'dumped' in poor countries. Local farmers cannot sell their goods as cheaply and go out of business.&lt;ref name="Oxfam"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Godfrey|first1=Claire|title=Stop the Dumping! How EU Agricultural Subsidies Are Damaging Livelihoods in the Developing World|url=http://www.iatp.org/files/Stop_the_Dumping_How_EU_Agricultural_Subsidies.htm|publisher=Institute for Agriculture &amp; Trade Policy|accessdate=16 February 2017|date=2002|archive-date=16 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216214819/https://www.iatp.org/files/Stop_the_Dumping_How_EU_Agricultural_Subsidies.htm|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign points to the treatment of agriculture at the WTO, which has institutionalised these injustices. In the few instances where developing countries have used the complex and expensive WTO process to declare subsidies (e.g. US cotton subsidies) excessive, developed countries ignore these rulings, which the WTO itself does not enforce. Recently rich countries have begun to talk about cutting export subsidies, but they often demand greater access to poor country markets in return.{{Citation needed |date=December 2014}}

The term "trade justice" emphasizes that even if the playing field were level, instead of tilted against developing countries, the poorest developing countries in particular would still struggle to gain from trade if forced to trade under [[free trade]] terms.  This is because of their overwhelming lack of competitiveness – poor countries do not have huge stocks of exports waiting to be shipped to rich countries, instead most small farmers want to be able to sell their goods locally.{{Citation needed |date=February 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.schooleconomicscience.org/em_post/justice-and-international-trade/|title=Justice and International Trade - School of Economic Science|work=School of Economic Science|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/nov/27/farming-subsidies-distort-advantages-food-insecurity|title=Why farming subsidies still distort advantages and cause food insecurity|last=Ghosh|first=Jayati|date=2013-11-27|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-20|work=|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SSO overhead image.JPG|thumb|Anglo-Australian telescope, Siding Spring]]
The '''WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey''' was a large-scale astronomical [[redshift survey]] carried out on the 3.9 metre [[Anglo-Australian Telescope]] (AAT) at the [[Siding Spring Observatory]], New South Wales between August 2006 and January 2011. The name stems from the measurement of [[baryon acoustic oscillations]] in the distribution of galaxies (“the baryon wiggles”).&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://wigglez.swin.edu.au/site/|title=WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey|accessdate= 20 December 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The survey measured the [[redshift]] of 240,000 galaxies in the Southern sky. Redshift is the increase in the wavelength of light emitted by a galaxy caused by its speed of motion away from an observer on Earth, enabling the distance of the galaxy from Earth to be computed according to [[Hubble's Law]]. The redshifts were measured using the AAOmega spectrograph, which can simultaneously analyse 392 galaxy spectra using optical fibres controlled by a robot positioner, providing a superior mapping speed.  Suitable targets were primarily selected by the orbiting [[GALEX]] satellite and to complete the survey required some 160 clear nights of telescope time.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url=http://astrogeo.oxfordjournals.org/content/49/5/5.19.full|title=The WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey|publisher=Oxford Journals|accessdate= 20 December 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt; The data enabled a three dimensional computer model of the galaxies to be calculated. The large number of observations makes it possible to study variations in the distribution of the galaxies caused by such features as baryon acoustic oscillations.

The work was carried out by a core team of 14 Australia-based astronomers led by Chris Blake and including Sarah Brough, [[Warrick Couch]], [[Karl Glazebrook]], Greg Poole, Tamara Davis, Michael Drinkwater, Russell Jurek, Kevin Pimbblet, Matthew Colless, Rob Sharp, Scott Croom, Michael Pracy, David Woods, Barry Madore, Chris Martin and Ted Wyder. The work was done in conjunction with collaborators in Toronto, Canada and at the California Institute of Technology and Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the United States.

The underlying purpose of the survey was to improve understanding of the phenomenon of "[[dark energy]]", proposed as the mechanism for the observed increasing rate of expansion of the universe, contradicting the traditional theories of gravitational attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dayton|first1=Leigh|title=After study of 240,000 galaxies, dark energy comes to light|work=[[The Australian]] |publisher=News Limited Australia|date=20 May 2011|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey results can be used in conjunction with measurements of [[Cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) to provide more accurate estimates of the composition of the universe. The results will also test current theories of gravity by mapping the growth of structure with redshift. Thirdly, detailed analysis of star-formation rates, environments, morphologies and luminosity functions will provide information on galaxy evolution.

The WiggleZ project was succeeded by the [[Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey]] (BOSS) based on the 2.5 metre telescope at [[Apache Point Observatory]], New Mexico and the [[Dark Energy Survey]] based on the 4 metre [[Blanco telescope]] in Chile.
