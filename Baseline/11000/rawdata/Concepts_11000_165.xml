'''Attentional blink''' ('''AB''') is a phenomenon that reflects the temporal costs in allocating selective attention. 
The AB is typically measured by using [[rapid serial visual presentation]] (RSVP) tasks, where participants often fail to detect a second salient target occurring in succession if it is presented between 180-450 ms after the first one. Also, the AB has been observed using two backward-masked targets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ward | first1 = R. | last2 = Duncan | first2 = J. | last3 = Shapiro | first3 = K. | year = 1997 | title = Effects of similarity, difficulty, and nontarget presentation on the time course of visual attention | url = | journal = Perception &amp; Psychophysics | volume = 59 | issue = 4| pages = 593–600 | doi=10.3758/bf03211867}}&lt;/ref&gt; and auditory stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arnell | first1 = K.

==Research==
The precise adaptive significance behind the attentional blink is unknown, but it is thought to be a product of a two-stage visual processing system attempting to allocate episodic context to targets. In this two-stage system, all stimuli are processed to some extent by an initial parallel stage, and only salient ones are selected for in-depth processing, in order to make optimum use of limited resources at a late serial stage.&lt;ref name="Chun1995"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0096-1523.21.1.109 |vauthors=Chun MM, Potter MC |title=A two-stage model for multiple target detection in rapid serial visual presentation |journal=J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=109–27 |date=February 1995 |pmid=7707027 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/xhp/21/1/109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One curious aspect of attentional blink is that it usually includes "lag 1 sparing", meaning that targets presented ''very'' close together in time (at "lag 1" or consecutively in the RSVP stream) are not affected by the attentional blink, even though items presented at slightly greater lags are significantly impaired. In attentional blink, participants in experiments have trouble reporting multiple targets that are in succession to one another, and will only report one accurately when these targets are presented to them 200ms to 500ms apart according to a study by Visser et al. (2015) .&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, Aug 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; These targets are denoted as T1, T2, etc. The phenomena lag-1 sparing refers to the performance of T2 as opposed to what precedes it, T1. T2 performance was originally hypothesized to be reported far less often and less accurately by participants than T1, because the attention of the participant would still be on T1 while T2 was presented immediately afterwards. Visser also thought that the participants would be too focussed on finding the first target that they would miss the second target completely. However, participants actually did better identifying T2 than they were at identifying T1 when the targets were separated by one or two distractors, denoted also as lags.&lt;ref name="Experimental Psychology 2015. pp. 462-478"&gt;Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, Vol 41(2), Apr, 2015. pp. 462-478.&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible explanation for lag-1 sparing is that this phenomenon is heavily interconnected with attentional blink, but does not operate on the same cognitive mechanisms and requires different stimuli to occur. Specifically, for lag-1 sparing to occur, it needs visual input as practice targets. These targets can be numbers or letters presented in rapid succession. When the first target, T1, is presented, it creates an attentional window because of its novelty, meaning that it attracts and holds more attention by the participant. The novelty that wears off between T1 and T2 creates a “boost” in attention and opens a metaphorical window for faster cognition. Participants now know what and how to look for targets, so they find targets more quickly. This attentional widow remains open long enough for T2 to be presented and processed at a much higher rate because of shared characteristics to T1. Targets are normally presented in less than .5 of a second from each other. Lag-1 sparing also occurred regardless of how information was visually presented. Of two RSVP streams— where T1 location was known in the first stream and unknown in the second stream, lag-1 sparing occurred whether T2 was in the same stream as T1, or in a different stream than T1.&lt;ref name="Experimental Psychology 2015. pp. 462-478"/&gt;

There is as yet no conclusive explanation for the phenomenon of lag 1 sparing, although it is thought to be related to the first parallel stage of the two-stage system of stimulus selection and processing.

According to the LC-NE hypothesis,&lt;ref name="Nieuwenhuis2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nieuwenhuis S, Gilzenrat MS, Holmes BD, Cohen JD |title=The role of the locus coeruleus in mediating the attentional blink: a neurocomputational theory |journal=J Exp Psychol Gen |volume=134 |issue=3 |pages=291–307 |date=August 2005 |pmid=16131265 |doi=10.1037/0096-3445.134.3.291 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/xge/134/3/291}}&lt;/ref&gt; when a salient, or meaningful stimulus is presented, [[neurons]] in the [[locus coeruleus]] release [[norepinephrine]], a neurotransmitter that benefits the detection of the stimulus. The effect of this release lasts for 100 ms after the salient stimulus is presented and benefits the second target when presented immediately after the first one, accounting for lag 1 sparing. Eventually the neurons in the locus coeruleus enter a refractory period, due to the auto-inhibitory effect of norepinephrine. According to the hypothesis, targets presented during this refractory period cannot trigger a release of norepinephrine, resulting in the attentional blink. The episodic distinctiveness hypothesis of the ST2 model&lt;ref name="Bowman2007"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bowman H, Wyble B |title=The simultaneous type, serial token model of temporal attention and working memory |journal=Psychol Rev |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=38–70 |date=January 2007 |pmid=17227181 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.114.1.38 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/rev/114/1/38}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the attentional blink reflects a limitation of the visual system attempting to allocate unique episodic contexts to the ephemeral target stimuli presented in RSVP.

The attentional blink can be moderated by changes in visual similarity between targets and distractor stimuli, but it can also be affected by ''conceptual'' similarities, suggesting that stimuli are processed to quite a deep level preconsciously, with much of the resulting information discarded before it reaches consciousness.

The attentional blink is related to, but distinct from the phenomenon of [[repetition blindness]].

Attentional Blink can be used in other studies and experiments as a way to measure attention. A study conducted by Morrison et al. 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=Amanda S.|last2=Brozovich|first2=Faith A.|last3=Lakhan-Pal|first3=Shreya|last4=Jazaieri|first4=Hooria|last5=Goldin|first5=Philippe R.|last6=Heimberg|first6=Richard G.|last7=Gross|first7=James J.|date=2016-03-01|title=Attentional blink impairment in social anxiety disorder: Depression comorbidity matters|journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry|volume=50|pages=209–214|doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2015.08.006|issn=1873-7943|pmid=26370394|pmc=4679612}}&lt;/ref&gt; used AB to measure attentional differences in people with mental disorders such as depression and social anxiety disorder. Measuring AB in the subjects was effective in showing that subjects with those disorders have more difficulty recognizing T2 than others. Another study used the magnitude of AB in order to see whether positive moods affected temporal attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacLean|first=Mary H.|last2=Arnell|first2=Karen M.|last3=Busseri|first3=Michael A.|date=2010-12-01|title=Dispositional affect predicts temporal attention costs in the attentional blink paradigm|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02699930903417897|journal=Cognition and Emotion|volume=24|issue=8|pages=1431–1438|doi=10.1080/02699930903417897|issn=0269-9931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emotion==
When AB is tested, most often the stimuli presented are inanimate objects. But research shows that not only do inanimate stimuli effect AB but human faces do as well.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eagles|first=Sarah|last2=Murphy|first2=Karen|date=2016-08-01|title=Inverted, Upright, and Blurred Faces Are Not Immune to the Attentional Blink|url=http://pec.sagepub.com/content/45/8/893|journal=Perception|language=en|volume=45|issue=8|pages=893–909|doi=10.1177/0301006616643665|issn=0301-0066}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the hypothesis that configural and featural information are processed by separate channels, thus avoiding AB, human faces in all different configurations, are still processed and affected by AB.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

An important factor which influences the AB is the role of emotions. Research has shown that when the second target (T2) in RSVP is an emotionally relevant stimulus it is more likely to be perceived during the attentional blink. The attentional blink is not only modulated by emotional relevance of (T2) but also by the emotional relevance of (T1). In short: when (T1) is emotionally relevant the AB is lengthened, when (T2) is emotionally relevant then the AB is reduced. This research suggests that emotion mediates attention.&lt;ref name="(Schwabe &amp; Wolf, 2010)."&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schwabe L, Wolf OT |title=Emotional modulation of the attentional blink: Is there an effect of stress? |journal=Emotion |volume=10 | issue = 2 |pages=283–288|date=April 2010|pmid= |doi= 10.1037/a0017751}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson AK, Phelps EA |title=Lesions of the human amygdala impair enhanced perception of emotionally salient events |journal=Nature |volume=411 |issue=6835 |pages=305–9 |date=May 2001 |pmid=11357132 |doi=10.1038/35077083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sex of the stimuli presented also influences the AB. In a study, it was shown that emotions that are more often than not prescribed to different sexes, were more quickly identified. Not only that, but when the attentional blink would occur, whether it be at lag 1 or lag 2, and how deep of a blink it was, could be manipulated by the sex of and the emotion expressed by T1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stebbins|first=Hilary E.|last2=Vanous|first2=Jesse B.|date=2015-08-01|title=The influence of stimulus sex and emotional expression on the attentional blink|journal=Emotion (Washington, D.C.)|volume=15|issue=4|pages=511–521|doi=10.1037/emo0000082|issn=1931-1516|pmid=26098728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been studies using images as emotional stimuli. Emotionally negative pictures preceding the target by 2 items were found to induce greater deficits in processing the target stimuli than neutral pictures did. Thus, it seems that emotional information can elicit attentional biases which temporarily prevent awareness of actively sought out stimuli.&lt;ref name="Most2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Most S, Chun M, Widders D, Zald D |title=Attentional rubbernecking: Cognitive control and personality in emotion-induced blindness |journal=Psychonomic Bulletin and Review | volume=12 |issue=4 | pages=654–61 |doi=10.3758/BF03196754 |pmid=16447378 |year=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meditation==
A study conducted by Heleen Slagter, Richard Davidson and colleagues, suggests that [[meditation]], particularly [[vipassana]], may reduce the duration of attentional blink. In an experiment, 17 people received three months of intensive training in meditation. Those 17 along with 23 meditation novices performed an attention task in which they successively picked out two numbers embedded in a series of letters. The novices exhibited attentional blink and missed the second number. In contrast, all the trained meditators consistently picked out both numbers. This indicated meditation practice can improve focus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=434D7C62-E7F2-99DF-37CC9814533B90D7 Biello, David (October 2007) ''Searching for God in the Brain'' Scientific American]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011195305/http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=434D7C62-E7F2-99DF-37CC9814533B90D7 |date=11 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=meditation-enhances-attention-video Scientific American video blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===The Inhibition Theory===
Raymond et al. (1992)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raymond|first=J.E.|author2=Shapiro, K.L.|author3=Arnell, K.M.|title=Temporary suppression of visual processing in an RSVP task: An attentional blink?|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|volume=18|pages=849–860|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.18.3.849|pmid=1500880|issue=3|date=August 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  suggest that the attentional blink is produced by perceptual uncertainty amongst the target (T1) and following target (T2). They suggest that this confusion happens at some point in the target identification processes. When confusion is eliminated, attentional blink isn’t observed. The researchers also suggested that one way to eliminate confusion is to have items that cannot be named.

===The Interference Theory===
Shapiro et al. (1994)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapiro|first=K.L.|author2=Raymond, J.E.|author3=Arnell, K.M.|title=Attention to visual pattern information produces the attentional blink in RSVP|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1994|volume=20|pages=357–371|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.20.2.357}}&lt;/ref&gt;  suggest that an interference model may better explain the attentional blink effects than the inhibition model. In this model, the attentional blink is thought to take place because of an out of place item which is selected out of the series because of the interference within the items in the series. Shapiro proposes that the amount of interference increases or decreases with the length of the series.

===The Delay of Processing Theory===
Giesbrecht and Di Lollo (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Giesbrecht|first=B|author2=Di Lollo, V.|title=Beyond the attentional blink: Visual marking by object substitution|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1998|volume=24|issue=5|pages=1454–1466|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.24.5.1454}}&lt;/ref&gt;  suggest that the attentional blink over target 2 results when the person is busy processing target 1. It is suggested that anything increasing the difficulty of processing of the first target will result in a greater attentional blink.

===The Attentional Capacity Theory===
Duncan et al. (1996)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first=J|author2=Martens, S.|author3=Ward, R.|title=Restricted attention capacity within but not between sensory modalities|journal=Nature|year=1996|volume=387|pages=808–810|pmid=9194561|doi=10.1038/42947|issue=6635}}&lt;/ref&gt;  suggest that the target 1 takes over parts of our attentional capacity, leading to a deficit of processing or recognizing target 2 when presented immediately after target 1. This theory suggests that the time for which target 1 continues to occupy attentional capacity is related directly to the difficulty of processing target 2.

===The Two-Stage Processing Theory===
Chun &amp; Potter (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chun|first=D.M.|author2=Potter, M.C.|title=A two-stage model for multiple target detection in rapid serial visual presentation|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=1995|volume=21|pages=109–127|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.21.1.109|pmid=7707027}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggest that quickly processing a series of items requires two back to back stages. The first stage is the initial rapid-detection. Here, the possible targets are noticed. The second stage is the capacity-limited in which items are taken in order to report later. Stage 2 occurs after the acknowledgement of targets in Stage 1. Here, stage 2 must finishing processing target 1, until then, target 2 will not be recognized in stage 2. If there is a situation where the second target comes in the first stage, the highway to stage two is delayed. Attentional blinking occurs when the second target is in stage 1 which causes a delay. The attentional blink mirror a restriction in the process of combining information from an unstable representation to a stable representation (Johnson &amp; Proctor, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Johnson |first1=Addie |title=Attention: Theory &amp; Practice |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wwu4W_aO8oAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Attention:+Theory+%26+Practice&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fYWPUq21F8zhsAS59oCgBw&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=SAGE |location=Thousand Oaks, California |isbn=9780761927617 |author2=Proctor, Robert |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burrhus Frederic Skinner''' (March 20, 1904 – August 18, 1990), commonly known as '''B. F. Skinner''', was an American [[psychologist]], [[behaviorist]], author, inventor, and [[Social philosophy|social philosopher]].&lt;ref name = "Smith_Woodward"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=L.

Skinner considered [[free will]] an illusion and human action dependent on consequences of previous actions. If the consequences are bad, there is a high chance the action will not be repeated; if the consequences are good, the probability of the action being repeated becomes stronger.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L., and Gilbert Daniel. (2011). Psychology. (2 ed.). New York, 2011. Web. March 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner called this the principle of reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schacter|first=Daniel|title=Psychology Second Edition|origyear=2009|year=2011|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=United States of America|isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To strengthen behavior, Skinner used [[operant conditioning]], and he considered the rate of response to be the most effective measure of response strength. To study operant conditioning, he invented the [[operant conditioning chamber]], also known as the Skinner Box,&lt;ref&gt;Schacter D, L., Gilbert D, T., &amp; Wegner D, M. (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; and to measure rate he invented the ''cumulative recorder''. Using these tools, he and [[C. B. Ferster]] produced his most influential experimental work, which appeared in their book ''Schedules of Reinforcement'' (1957).&lt;ref name="BO"&gt;B. F. Skinner, (1938) ''The Behavior of Organisms''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SR"&gt;C. B. Ferster &amp; B. F. Skinner, (1957) ''Schedules of Reinforcement''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner developed [[Applied behavior analysis|behavior analysis]], the philosophy of that science he called [[radical behaviorism]],&lt;ref name="AB"&gt;B. F. Skinner, ''About Behaviorism''&lt;/ref&gt; and founded a school of experimental research psychology—the [[experimental analysis of behavior]].  He imagined the application of his ideas to the design of a human community in his utopian novel, ''[[Walden Two]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1948). Walden Two. Indianapolis: Hackett. {{ISBN|0-87220-779-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and his analysis of human behavior culminated in his work, ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1958) Verbal Behavior. Acton, MA: Copley Publishing Group. {{ISBN|1-58390-021-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Skinner was a prolific author who published 21&amp;nbsp;books and 180&amp;nbsp;articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww2.lafayette.edu/~allanr/biblio.html Lafayette.edu], accessed on 5-20-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfskinner.org/f/SmithMorrisBibliography.pdf BFSkinner.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414011557/http://www.bfskinner.org/f/SmithMorrisBibliography.pdf |date=April 14, 2008 }}, Smith Morris Bibliography&lt;/ref&gt;  Contemporary academia considers Skinner a pioneer of modern behaviorism, along with [[John B.

== Biography ==
[[File:BF Skinner Grave.JPG|thumb|The gravestone of B.F. Skinner and his wife Eve at Mount Auburn Cemetery]]

Skinner was born in [[Susquehanna, Pennsylvania]], to Grace and William Skinner. His father was a lawyer. He became an [[atheism|atheist]] after a Christian teacher tried to assuage his fear of the hell that his grandmother described.&lt;ref&gt;"Within a year I had gone to Miss Graves to tell her that I no longer believed in God. 'I know,' she said, 'I have been through that myself.' But her strategy misfired: I never went through it." B.F. Skinner, pp. 387-413, E.G. Boring and G. Lindzey's ''A History of Psychology in Autobiography'' (Vol. 5), New York: Appleton Century-Crofts, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother Edward, two and a half years younger, died at age sixteen of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]].

Skinner's closest friend as a young boy was Raphael Miller, whom he called Doc because his father was a doctor.  Doc and Skinner became friends due to their parents’ religiousness and both had an interest in contraptions and gadgets.  They had set up a telegraph line between their houses to send messages to each other, although they had to call each other on the telephone due to the confusing messages sent back and forth.  During one summer, Doc and Skinner started an elderberry business to gather berries and sell them door to door.  They had found out that when they picked the ripe berries, the unripe ones came off the branches too, so they built a device that was able to separate them.  The device was a bent piece of metal to form a trough. They would pour water down the trough into a bucket, and the ripe berries would sink into the bucket and the unripe ones would be pushed over the edge to be thrown away.&lt;ref name="Skinner, B. 1976"&gt;Skinner, B. (1976). Particulars of my life (1st ed.). New York, NY: Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt;

He attended [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] in New York with the intention of becoming a writer. He found himself at a social disadvantage at Hamilton College because of his intellectual attitude.&lt;ref name="B.F. Skinner 2013"&gt;''B.F. Skinner: A Life'' [Paperback]. by Daniel W. Bjork, {{ISBN|9781557984166}}: Amazon.com: Books. N.p., n.d. Web. June 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; While attending, he joined [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity. Hamilton was known for being a strong fraternity college.  Skinner had thought that his fraternity brothers were respectful and did not haze or mistreat the newcomers, instead, they helped out the other boys with courses or other activities.  Freshmen were called “‘slimers’” who had to wear small green knit hats and greet everyone that they passed for punishment.  The year before Skinner entered Hamilton, there was a hazing accident that caused the death of a student.  The freshman was asleep in his bed when he was pushed onto the floor, where he smashed his head, resulting in his death.  Skinner had a similar incident where two freshmen captured him and tied him to a pole, where he should have stayed all night, but he had a razor blade in his shoe for emergency and managed to cut himself free.&lt;ref name="Skinner, B. 1976"/&gt; He wrote for the school paper, but, as an atheist, he was critical of the traditional mores of his college. After receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in English literature in 1926, he attended Harvard University, where he would later research, teach, and eventually become a prestigious board member. While he was at Harvard, a fellow student, Fred Keller, convinced Skinner that he could make an [[experimental science]] from the study of behavior. This led Skinner to invent his prototype for the [[Skinner Box]] and to join Keller in the creation of other tools for small experiments.&lt;ref name="B.F. Skinner 2013" /&gt; After graduation, he unsuccessfully tried to write a great novel while he lived with his parents, a period that he later called the Dark Years.&lt;ref name="B.F. Skinner 2013" /&gt; He became disillusioned with his literary skills despite encouragement from the renowned poet [[Robert Frost]], concluding that he had little world experience and no strong personal perspective from which to write. His encounter with [[John B. Watson]]'s ''Behaviorism'' led him into graduate study in psychology and to the development of his own version of behaviorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=B. F. Skinner: a Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from Harvard in 1931, and remained there as a researcher until 1936. He then taught at the [[University of Minnesota]] at Minneapolis and later at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]], where he was chair of the psychology department from 1946–1947, before returning to Harvard as a tenured professor in 1948. He remained at Harvard for the rest of his life. In 1973, Skinner was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=[[American Humanist Association]] | accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, Skinner married Yvonne (Eve) Blue. The couple had two daughters, [[Julie Vargas|Julie]] (m. Vargas) and Deborah (m. [[Barry Buzan|Buzan]]).&lt;ref name="Deborah Skinner"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://horsesbyskinner.com/?page_id=12|title=About|last=Skinner|first=Deborah|work=Horses by Skinner|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/mar/12/highereducation.uk|title=I was not a lab rat|last=Buzan|first=Deborah Skinner|date=March 12, 2004|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yvonne Skinner died in 1997,&lt;ref name="Papers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Skinner, Yvonne, 1911-1997.

(1993). B.F. Skinner, A Life. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner's public exposure had increased in the 1970s, he remained active even after his retirement in 1974, until his death.  In 1989, Skinner was diagnosed with leukemia and died on August 18, 1990 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Ten days before his death, he was given the lifetime achievement award by the American Psychological Association and gave a talk in an auditorium concerning his work.&lt;ref&gt;The Famous People. (2017). B. F. Skinner biography&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversial figure, Skinner has been depicted in many different ways. He has been widely revered for bringing a much-needed scientific approach to the study of human behavior; he has also been vilified for attempting to apply findings based largely on animal experiments to human behavior in real-life settings.

== Contributions to psychological theory ==

===Behaviorism===
{{Main|Behaviorism|Radical behaviorism}}
Skinner called his approach to the study of behavior [[radical behaviorism]].&lt;ref&gt;''About Behaviorism'' Ch. 1 ''Causes of Behavior'' § 3 ''Radical Behaviorism'' B. F. Skinner 1974 {{ISBN|0-394-71618-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophy of behavioral science assumes that behavior is a consequence of environmental histories of reinforcement (see [[Applied behavior analysis]]). In contrast to the approach of [[cognitive science]], behaviorism does not accept private events such as thinking, perceptions, and unobservable emotions as causes of an organism's behavior. However, in contrast to methodological behaviorism, Skinner's radical behaviorism did accept thoughts, emotions, and other "private events" as responses subject to the same rules as overt behavior. In his words: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
 The position can be stated as follows: what is felt or introspectively observed is not some nonphysical world of [[consciousness]], mind, or mental life but the observer's own body. This does not mean, as I shall show later, that introspection is a kind of psychological research, nor does it mean (and this is the heart of the argument) that what are felt or introspectively observed are the causes of the behavior. An organism behaves as it does because of its current structure, but most of this is out of reach of introspection. At the moment we must content ourselves, as the methodological behaviorist insists, with a person's genetic and environment histories. What are introspectively observed are certain collateral products of those histories.
&lt;br/&gt;...&lt;br/&gt;
In this way we repair the major damage wrought by [[mentalism (psychology)|mentalism]]. When what a person does [is] attributed to what is going on inside him, investigation is brought to an end. Why explain the explanation? For twenty five hundred years people have been preoccupied with feelings and mental life, but only recently has any interest been shown in a more precise analysis of the role of the environment. Ignorance of that role led in the first place to mental fictions, and it has been perpetuated by the explanatory practices to which they gave rise.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''. pp. 18−20 of the paperback edition which had the redacted typo s/it/is/.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Theoretical structure===
Skinner's behavioral theory was largely set forth in his first book, ''Behavior of Organisms''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skinner|first1=B.F.|title=Behavior of Organisms|date=1938|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here he gave a systematic description of the manner in which environmental variables control behavior. He distinguished two sorts of behavior—respondent and operant—which are controlled in different ways.  ''Respondent'' behaviors are elicited by stimuli, and may be modified through respondent conditioning, which is often called "Pavlovian conditioning" or "[[classical conditioning]]", in which a neutral stimulus is paired with an eliciting stimulus. ''Operant'' behaviors, in contrast, are "emitted", meaning that initially they are not induced by any particular stimulus. They are strengthened through operant conditioning, sometimes called "instrumental conditioning", in which the occurrence of a response yields a reinforcer. Respondent behaviors might be measured by their latency or strength, operant behaviors by their rate. Both of these sorts of behavior had already been studied experimentally, for example, respondents by Pavlov,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pavlov|first1=I. P.|title=Conditioned Reflexes|date=1927|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operants by Thorndike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorndike|first1=E. L.|title=Animal Intelligence: Experimental Studies|date=1911|publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's account differed in some ways from earlier ones,&lt;ref name="Jenkins"&gt;Jenkins, H.M. "Animal Learning and Behavior", Ch. 5, in Hearst, E. "The First Century of Experimental Psychology" (1979) Erlbaum: Hillsdale, N. J.&lt;/ref&gt; and was one of the first accounts to bring them under one roof.

The idea that behavior is strengthened or weakened by its consequences raises several questions.  Among the most important are these: (1) Operant responses are strengthened by reinforcement, but where do they come from in the first place?  (2) Once it is in the organism's repertoire, how is a response directed or controlled?  (3) How can very complex and seemingly novel behaviors be explained?{{clarify |date=May 2016 |reason=great questions, but were they raised by Skinner, and, if so, a source/reference should be given. If not, were they simply put here by a WP editor?}}

====Origin of operant behavior====
Skinner's answer to the first question was very much like Darwin's answer to the question of the origin of a "new" bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment; a variation that is followed by reinforcement is strengthened and becomes prominent in that individual's behavioral repertoire. "Shaping" was Skinner's term for the gradual modification of behavior by the reinforcement of desired variations. As discussed later in this article, Skinner believed that "superstitious" behavior can arise when a response{{clarify |date=May 2016 |reason=not really needing "clarification" but is the best word here?}} happens to be followed by reinforcement to which it is actually unrelated.

====Control of operant behavior====
The second question, "how is operant behavior controlled?" arises because, to begin with, the behavior is "emitted" without reference to any particular stimulus.  Skinner answered this question by saying that a stimulus comes to control an operant if it is present when the response is reinforced and absent when it is not.  For example, if lever-pressing only brings food when a light is on, a rat, or a child, will learn to press the lever only when the light is on. Skinner summarized this relationship by saying that a discriminative stimulus (e.g. light) sets the occasion for the reinforcement (food) of the operant (lever-press). This [[three-term contingency]] (stimulus-response-reinforcer) is one of Skinner's most important concepts, and sets his theory apart from theories that use only pair-wise associations.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

====Explaining complex behavior====
Most behavior of humans cannot easily be described in terms of individual responses reinforced one by one, and Skinner devoted a great deal of effort to the problem of behavioral complexity. Some complex behavior can be seen as a sequence of relatively simple responses, and here Skinner invoked the idea of "chaining."  Chaining is based on the fact, experimentally demonstrated, that a discriminative stimulus not only sets the occasion for subsequent behavior, but it can also reinforce a behavior that precedes it. That is, a discriminative stimulus is also a "conditioned reinforcer." For example, the light that sets the occasion for lever pressing may also be used to reinforce "turning around" in the presence of a noise. This results in the sequence "noise - turn-around - light - press lever - food." Much longer chains can be built by adding more stimuli and responses.

However, Skinner recognized that a great deal of behavior, especially human behavior, cannot be accounted for by gradual shaping or the construction of response sequences.&lt;ref name="Contingencies"&gt;Skinner, B. F. (1966) Contingencies of Reinforcement, New York; Appleton-Century-Crofts. reprinted 2013, B. F. Skinner Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex behavior often appears suddenly in its final form, as when a person first finds his way to the elevator by following instructions given at the front desk. To account for such behavior, Skinner introduced the concept of rule-governed behavior. First, relatively simple behaviors come under the control of verbal stimuli: the child learns to "jump", "open the book", and so on.  After a large number of responses come under such verbal control, a sequence of verbal stimuli can evoke an almost unlimited variety of complex responses.&lt;ref name="Contingencies"/&gt;

===Reinforcement===
{{Main|Reinforcement}}
Reinforcement, a key concept of [[behaviorism]], is the primary process that shapes and controls behavior, and occurs in two ways, "positive" and "negative."  In ''The Behavior of Organisms'' (1938), Skinner defined "negative reinforcement" to be synonymous with [[punishment]], that is, the presentation of an aversive stimulus. Subsequently, in ''Science and Human Behavior'' (1953), Skinner redefined negative reinforcement. In what has now become the standard set of definitions, positive reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the occurrence of some event (e.g., praise after some behavior is performed), whereas negative reinforcement is the strengthening of behavior by the removal or avoidance of some aversive event (e.g., opening and raising an umbrella over your head on a rainy day is reinforced by the cessation of rain falling on you).

Both types of reinforcement strengthen behavior, or increase the probability of a behavior reoccurring; the difference is in whether the reinforcing event is something applied ([[positive reinforcement]]) or something removed or avoided ([[negative reinforcement]]). Punishment is the application of an aversive stimulus/event (positive punishment or punishment by contingent stimulation) or the removal of a desirable stimulus ([[negative punishment]] or punishment by contingent withdrawal). Though punishment is often used to suppress behavior, Skinner argued that this suppression is temporary and has a number of other, often unwanted, consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. Science and Human Behavior (1953) New York: Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; Extinction is the absence of a rewarding stimulus, which weakens behavior.

Writing in 1981, Skinner pointed out that Darwinian natural selection is, like reinforced behavior, "selection by consequences." Though, as he said, natural selection has now "made its case", he regretted that essentially the same process, "reinforcement", was less widely accepted as underlying human behavior.&lt;ref name=Skinner1981&gt;{{Cite journal |date=July 31, 1981 |author=Skinner, B.F |title=Selection by Consequences |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=213 |issue=4507 |pages=501–504 |doi=10.1126/science.7244649 |url=http://www.psychology.uiowa.edu/Classes/31174/Documents/Selection%20by%20Consequences.pdf |accessdate=August 14, 2010 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==== Schedules of reinforcement ====
{{Main|Schedules of reinforcement}}
Skinner recognized that behavior is typically reinforced more than once, and, together with C. B. Ferster, he did an extensive analysis of the various ways in which reinforcements could be arranged over time, which he called "[[schedules of reinforcement]]."&lt;ref name="Schedules"&gt;Ferster, C. B. and Skinner, B. F.  Schedules of Reinforcement.  New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable schedules of reinforcement studied by Skinner were continuous, interval (fixed or variable), and ratio (fixed or variable). All are methods used in [[operant conditioning]].

* '''Continuous reinforcement (CRF)''' — each time a specific action is performed the subject receives a reinforcement. This method is effective when teaching a new behavior because it quickly establishes an association between the target behavior and the reinforcer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Different Types of Reinforcement Scedules|url=http://autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/sites/autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/files/Reinforcement-Table1.pdf|website=autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu|publisher=National Professional Development Center for Autism Spectrum Disorders|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Interval Schedules''' — based on the time intervals between reinforcements&lt;ref name="Psychology 2nd Edition"&gt;Psychology 2nd Edition&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''Fixed Interval Schedule (FI)''': A procedure in which reinforcements are presented at fixed time periods, provided that the appropriate response is made. This schedule yields a response rate that is low just after reinforcement and becomes rapid just before the next reinforcement is scheduled.
**'''Variable Interval Schedule (VI)''': A procedure in which behavior is reinforced after random time durations following the last reinforcement. This schedule yields steady responding at a rate that varies with the average frequency of reinforcement.
*'''Ratio Schedules''' — based on the ratio of responses to reinforcements&lt;ref name="Psychology 2nd Edition"/&gt;
**'''Fixed Ratio Schedule (FR)''':  A procedure in which reinforcement is delivered after a specific number of responses have been made.
**'''Variable Ratio Schedule (VR)''': A procedure in which reinforcement comes after a number of responses that is randomized from one reinforcement to the next (ex. slot machines). The lower the number of responses required, the higher the response rate tends to be. Ratio schedules tend to produce very rapid responding, often with breaks of no responding just after reinforcement if a large number of responses is required for reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel L.

==Scientific inventions==

=== Operant conditioning chamber ===
{{Main|Operant conditioning chamber}}
An [[operant conditioning chamber]] (also known as a ''Skinner Box'') is a laboratory apparatus used in the experimental analysis of animal behavior.  It was invented by Skinner while he was a graduate student at [[Harvard University]]. As used by Skinner, the box had a lever (for rats), or a disk in one wall (for pigeons). A press on this "manipulandum" could deliver food to the animal through an opening in the wall, and responses reinforced in this way increased in frequency. By controlling this reinforcement together with discriminative stimuli such as lights and tones, or punishments such as electric shocks, experimenters have used the operant box to study a wide variety of topics, including schedules of reinforcement, discriminative control, delayed response ("memory"), punishment, and so on. By channeling research in these directions, the operant conditioning chamber has had a huge influence on course of research in animal learning and its applications. It enabled great progress on problems that could be studied by measuring the rate, probability, or force of a simple, repeatable response. However, it discouraged the study of behavioral processes not easily conceptualized in such terms—spatial learning, in particular, which is now studied in quite different ways, for example, by the use of the [[Water maze (neuroscience)|water maze]].&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

=== Cumulative recorder ===

The cumulative recorder makes a pen-and-ink record of simple repeated responses. Skinner designed it for use with the [[Operant chamber]] as a convenient way to record and view the rate of responses such as a lever press or a key peck.  In this device, a sheet of paper gradually unrolls over a cylinder.  Each response steps a small pen across the paper, starting at one edge; when the pen reaches the other edge, it quickly resets to the initial side. The slope of the resulting ink line graphically displays the rate of the response; for example, rapid responses yield a steeply sloping line on the paper, slow responding yields a line of low slope. The cumulative recorder was a key tool used by Skinner in his analysis of behavior, and it was very widely adopted by other experimenters, gradually falling out of use with the advent of the laboratory computer.{{citation needed |date=May 2016}}  Skinner's major experimental exploration of response rates, presented in his book with C. B. Ferster, ''Schedules of Reinforcement'', is full of cumulative records produced by this device.&lt;ref name="Schedules"/&gt;

=== Air crib ===
The air crib is an easily cleaned, temperature- and humidity-controlled enclosure intended to replace the standard infant [[Infant bed|crib]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/06/what-man-can-make-of-man/308973/ Air-crib photograph] in "What Man Can Make of Man", by [[James Bennet (journalist)|James Bennet]]. ''[[The Atlantic]],'' June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Skinner invented the device to help his wife cope with the day-to-day tasks of child rearing. It was designed to make early childcare simpler (by reducing laundry, diaper rash, cradle cap, etc.), while allowing the baby to be more mobile and comfortable, and less prone to cry. Reportedly it had some success in these goals.&lt;ref name="snopes" /&gt;

The air crib was a controversial invention. It was popularly mischaracterized as a cruel pen, and it was often compared to Skinner's [[operant conditioning chamber]], commonly called the "Skinner Box." This association with laboratory animal experimentation discouraged its commercial success, though several companies attempted production.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;Snopes.com [http://www.snopes.com/science/skinner.asp "One Man and a Baby Box"], accessed on 12-29-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burrhus Fredrick Skinner|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/worldsocs/skinner_burrhus_frederic_1904_1990|work=Skinner, Burrhus Frederic (1904 - 1990)|publisher=Gale, Credo Reference|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 book by [[Lauren Slater]], entitled ''[[Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychology Experiments of the Twentieth Century]]''&lt;ref name="OB"&gt;Slater, L. (2004) [[Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychology Experiments of the Twentieth Century|Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century]], London, Bloomsbury&lt;/ref&gt; caused a stir by mentioning the rumors that Skinner had used his baby daughter, Deborah, in some of his experiments, and that she had subsequently committed suicide. Although Slater's book stated that the rumors were false, a reviewer in ''[[The Observer]]'' in March 2004 misquoted Slater's book as supporting the rumors. This review was read by Deborah Skinner (now Deborah Buzan, an artist and writer living in London) who wrote a vehement riposte in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buzan|first=Deborah Skinner|title=I was not a lab rat|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/mar/12/highereducation.uk|accessdate=May 29, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=March 12, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching machine ===
[[Image:Skinner teaching machine 01.jpg|thumb|right|The teaching machine, a mechanical invention to automate the task of [[programmed learning]]]]

The [[teaching machine]] was a [[mechanical device]] whose purpose was to administer a curriculum of [[programmed learning]]. The machine embodies key elements of Skinner's theory of learning and had important implications for education in general and classroom instruction in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Skinner|first=B. F.|title=Why we need teaching machines|journal=Harvard Educational Review|year=1961|volume=31|pages=377–398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one incarnation, the machine was a box that housed a list of questions that could be viewed one at a time through a small window. (See picture). There was also a mechanism through which the learner could respond to each question. Upon delivering a correct answer, the learner would be rewarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.coe.uh.edu/smcneil/cuin6373/idhistory/1950.html|title=Programmed Instruction and Task Analysis|publisher=College of Education, University of Houston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skinner advocated the use of teaching machines for a broad range of students (e.g., preschool aged to adult) and instructional purposes (e.g., reading and music). For example, one machine that he envisioned could teach rhythm. He wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;A relatively simple device supplies the necessary contingencies. The student taps a rhythmic pattern in unison with the device. "Unison" is specified very loosely at first (the student can be a little early or late at each tap) but the specifications are slowly sharpened. The process is repeated for various speeds and patterns. In another arrangement, the student echoes rhythmic patterns sounded by the machine, though not in unison, and again the specifications for an accurate reproduction are progressively sharpened. Rhythmic patterns can also be brought under the control of a printed score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skinner | first1 = B.F. | year = 1961 | title = Teaching machines | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 205 | issue = | pages = 90–112 | doi = 10.2307/1926170 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The instructional potential of the teaching machine stemmed from several factors: it provided automatic, immediate and regular reinforcement without the use of aversive control; the material presented was coherent, yet varied and novel; the pace of learning could be adjusted to suit the individual. As a result, students were interested, attentive, and learned efficiently by producing the desired behavior, "learning by doing."&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B. F. and Holland, J. "The Analysis of Behavior: A Program for Self Instruction", 1961, p.387&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching machines, though perhaps rudimentary, were not rigid instruments of instruction. They could be adjusted and improved based upon the students' performance. For example, if a student made many incorrect responses, the machine could be reprogrammed to provide less advanced prompts or questions—the idea being that students acquire behaviors most efficiently if they make few errors. Multiple-choice formats were not well-suited for teaching machines because they tended to increase student mistakes, and the contingencies of reinforcement were relatively uncontrolled.

Not only useful in teaching explicit skills, machines could also promote the development of a repertoire of behaviors that Skinner called self-management. Effective self-management means attending to stimuli appropriate to a task, avoiding distractions, reducing the opportunity of reward for competing behaviors, and so on. For example, machines encourage students to pay attention before receiving a reward. Skinner contrasted this with the common classroom practice of initially capturing students’ attention (e.g., with a lively video) and delivering a reward (e.g., entertainment) before the students have actually performed any relevant behavior. This practice fails to reinforce correct behavior and actually counters the development of self-management.

Skinner pioneered the use of teaching machines in the classroom, especially at the primary level. Today computers run software that performs similar teaching tasks, and there has been a resurgence of interest in the topic related to the development of adaptive learning systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philmcrae.com/2/post/2013/04/rebirth-of-the-teaching-maching-through-the-seduction-of-data-analytics-this-time-its-personal1.html|title=Rebirth of the Teaching Machine through the Seduction of Data Analytics: This Time It's Personal|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pigeon-guided missile ===
{{Main|Project Pigeon}}
During World War II, the [[US Navy]] required a weapon effective against surface ships, such as the German [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'' class]] battleships. Although [[missile]] and [[Television guidance|TV]] technology existed, the size of the primitive guidance systems available rendered automatic guidance impractical. To solve this problem, Skinner initiated [[Project Pigeon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Skinner | first1 = B.

New York: Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt; which was intended to provide a simple and effective guidance system. This system divided the nose cone of a missile into three compartments, with a pigeon placed in each. Lenses projected an image of distant objects onto a screen in front of each bird. Thus, when the missile was launched from an aircraft within sight of an enemy ship, an image of the ship would appear on the screen. The screen was hinged, such that pecks at the image of the ship would guide the missile toward the ship.&lt;ref name="NMAH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=353|title=Nose Cone, Pigeon-Guided Missile|publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=June 10, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080516215806/http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=353| archivedate= May 16, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite an effective demonstration, the project was abandoned, and eventually more conventional solutions, such as those based on radar, became available. Skinner complained that "our problem was no one would take us seriously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Skinner's Utopia: Panacea, or Path to Hell?|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|date=September 20, 1971|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,909994-5,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seemed that few people would trust pigeons to guide a missile, no matter how reliable the system appeared to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Richard Dawkins]]|title=Design for a Faith-Based Missile|journal=Free Inquiry magazine|volume= 22|issue= 1|url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/dawkins_22_1.html}} The project was also featured by {{cite news

=== Verbal summator ===

Early in his career Skinner became interested in "latent speech" and experimented with a device he called the "verbal summator."&lt;ref name="doi_9917445"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Skinner |first=B. F. |year=1936 |title=The Verbal Summator and a Method for the Study of Latent Speech |journal=[[Journal of Psychology]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=71–107 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1936.9917445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This device can be thought of as an auditory version  of the Rorschach inkblots.&lt;ref name="doi_9917445" /&gt; When using the device, human participants listened to incomprehensible auditory "garbage" but often read meaning into what they heard. Thus, as with the Rorschach blots, the device was intended to yield overt behavior that projected subconscious thoughts.  Skinner's interest in projective testing was brief, but he later used observations with the summator in creating his theory of verbal behavior.  The device also led other researchers to invent new tests such as the tautophone test, the auditory apperception test, and the Azzageddi{{Definition|date=May 2016}} test.&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, A., B. F. Skinner and the auditory inkblot: The rise and fall of the verbal summator as a projective technique, History of Psychology, 2003,4,362-378.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Verbal Behavior'' ==
{{Main|Verbal Behavior (book)}}
Challenged by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] during a casual discussion while at Harvard to provide an account of a randomly provided piece of verbal behavior,&lt;ref&gt;B. F. Skinner, (1957) ''Verbal Behavior''. The account in the appendix is that he asked Skinner to explain why he said "No black scorpion, Carter is falling upon this table."&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner set about attempting to extend his then-new functional, inductive approach to the complexity of human verbal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skinner, Burrhus Frederick(1904 - 1990).|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/worldsocs/skinner_burrhus_frederic_1904_1990|work=Credo Reference, Gale|publisher=Credo Reference, Gale|accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developed over two decades, his work appeared in the book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''. Although Noam Chomsky was highly critical of ''Verbal Behavior'', he conceded that Skinner's "S-R psychology" was worth a review. (Behavior analysts reject the "S-R" characterization: operant conditioning involves the emission of a response which then becomes more or less likely depending upon its consequence–see above.).&lt;ref name="RVB"&gt;A. N. Chomsky, (1957) "A Review of BF Skinner's Verbal Behavior." [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm in the preface, 2nd paragraph]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Verbal Behavior'' had an uncharacteristically cool reception, partly as a result of Chomsky's review, partly because of Skinner's failure to address or rebut any of Chomsky's criticisms.&lt;ref&gt;Richelle, M. (1993). ''B. F. Skinner: A reappraisal''. Hillsdale: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's peers may have been slow to adopt the ideas presented in ''Verbal Behavior'' because of the absence of experimental evidence—unlike the empirical density that marked Skinner's experimental work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1901/jeab.1984.42-363 | last1 = Michael | first1 = J. | year = 1984 | title = Verbal behavior | url = | journal = Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior | volume = 42 | issue = 3| pages = 363–376 | pmid = 16812395 | pmc = 1348108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in applied settings there has been a resurgence of interest in Skinner's functional analysis of verbal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;The Analysis of Verbal Behavior (Journal)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on education ==
{{More citations needed|date=December 2007}}
&lt;!--Good idea to have this section, but it needs to be written in an encyclopedic style, with references--&gt;
&lt;!--A possible source might be The Technology of Teaching, as well as Keller's PSM and so on and so on--&gt;
Skinner's views influenced [[education]] as well as psychology. Skinner argued that education has two major purposes: (1) to teach repertoires of both verbal and nonverbal behavior; and (2) to interest students in learning. He recommended bringing students’ behavior under appropriate control by providing reinforcement only in the presence of stimuli relevant to the learning task. Because he believed that human behavior can be affected by small consequences, something as simple as "the opportunity to move forward after completing one stage of an activity" can be an effective reinforcer &lt;!-- What is this a citation from? --&gt;. Skinner was convinced that, to learn, a student must engage in behavior, and not just passively receive information. (Skinner, 1961, p.&amp;nbsp;389).

Skinner believed that effective teaching must be based on positive reinforcement which is, he argued, more effective at changing and establishing behavior than punishment. He suggested that the main thing people learn from being punished is how to avoid punishment. For example, if a child is forced to practice playing an instrument, the child comes to associate practicing with punishment and thus learns to hate and avoid practicing the instrument. This view had obvious implications for the then widespread practice of [[rote learning]] and [[school discipline|punitive discipline]] in education. The use of educational activities as punishment may induce rebellious behavior such as vandalism or absence.&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;Holland, J. (1992). B.F Skinner. Pittsburgh: American Psychologist&lt;/ref&gt;

Because teachers are primarily responsible for modifying student behavior, Skinner argued that teachers must learn effective ways of teaching. In ''The Technology of Teaching'', Skinner has a chapter on why teachers fail (pages 93–113): He says that teachers have not been given an in-depth understanding of [[teaching]] and [[learning]]. Without knowing the science underpinning teaching, teachers fall back on procedures that work poorly or not at all, such as:
:* using aversive techniques (which produce escape and avoidance and undesirable emotional effects);
:* relying on telling and explaining ("Unfortunately, a student does not learn simply when he is shown or told." p.&amp;nbsp;103);
:* failing to adapt learning tasks to the student's current level;
:* failing to provide positive reinforcement frequently enough.

Skinner suggests that any age-appropriate skill can be taught. The steps are
#Clearly specify the action or performance the student is to learn.
#Break down the task into small achievable steps, going from simple to complex.
#Let the student perform each step, reinforcing correct actions.
#Adjust so that the student is always successful until finally the goal is reached.
#Shift to intermittent reinforcement to maintain the student's performance.
Skinner's views on education are extensively presented in his book ''The Technology of Teaching''. They are also reflected in [[Fred S. Keller]]'s ''Personalized System of Instruction'' and [[Ogden Lindsley|Ogden R. Lindsley]]'s ''[[Precision teaching|Precision Teaching]]''.

== ''Walden Two'' and ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'' ==
Skinner is popularly known mainly for his books ''[[Walden Two]]'' and ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]],'' (for which he made the cover of ''[[TIME]]'' Magazine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=B.F. Skinner Sep. 20, 1971 |url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19710920,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former describes a fictional "experimental community"&lt;ref&gt;B. F. Skinner, (1968). "The Design of Experimental Communities", ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'' (Volume 16). New York: Macmillan, 1968, pages 271-275.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1940s United States. The productivity and happiness of citizens in this community is far greater than in the outside world because the residents practice scientific social planning and use operant conditioning in raising their children.

''Walden Two'', like [[Henry David Thoreau|Thoreau]]'s ''[[Walden]]'', champions a lifestyle that does not support war, or foster competition and social strife. It encourages a lifestyle of minimal consumption, rich social relationships, personal happiness, satisfying work, and leisure.&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, Richard David, ''Morning Star: The Values-Communication of Skinner's '''Walden Two''''', Ph.D. dissertation, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, December 1979, available from University Microfilms, Ann Arbor, MI. Attempts to analyze ''Walden Two'', ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', and other Skinner works in the context of Skinner's life; lists over 500 sources.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, [[Kat Kinkade]] and others founded the [[Twin Oaks Community]], using Walden Two as a blueprint. The community still exists and continues to use the Planner-Manager system and other aspects of the community described in Skinner's book, though behavior modification is not a community practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Living Walden Two: B. F. Skinner's Behaviorist Utopia and Experimental Communities|author=Hilke Kuhlman|publisher=University of Illinois Press|date= Oct 1, 2010|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', Skinner suggests that a technology of behavior could help to make a better society. We would, however, have to accept that an [[autonomous agent]] is not the driving force of our actions. Skinner offers alternatives to punishment, and challenges his readers to use science and modern technology to construct a better society.

== Political views ==
Skinner's political writings emphasized his hopes that an effective and human science of behavioral control – a technology of human behavior – could help with problems as yet unsolved and often aggravated by advances in technology such as the [[atomic bomb]]. Indeed, one of Skinner's goals was to prevent humanity from destroying itself.&lt;ref&gt;see Beyond Freedom and Dignity, 1974 for example&lt;/ref&gt; He saw political activity as the use of aversive or non-aversive means to control a population. Skinner favored the use of [[positive reinforcement]] as a means of control, citing [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]'s novel ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'' as an example of literature that "did not fear the power of positive reinforcement."&lt;ref name="W2"/&gt;

Skinner's book, ''Walden Two'', presents a vision of a decentralized, localized society, which applies a practical, scientific approach and behavioral expertise to deal peacefully with social problems. (For example, his views led him to oppose corporal punishment in schools, and he wrote a letter to the California Senate that helped lead it to a ban on spanking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nanette |last=Asimov |title=Spanking Debate Hits Assembly |work=SFGate|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=January 30, 1996 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1996/01/30/MN71634.DTL&amp;hw=spanking+debate&amp;sn=009&amp;sc=334 |accessdate=March 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Skinner's [[utopia]] is both a thought experiment and a [[rhetoric]]al piece. In ''Walden Two'', Skinner answers the problem that exists in many utopian novels – "What is the Good Life?" The book's answer is a life of friendship, health, art, a healthy balance between work and leisure, a minimum of unpleasantness, and a feeling that one has made worthwhile contributions to a society in which resources are ensured, in part, by minimizing consumption.

== Superstition in the pigeon ==
One of Skinner's experiments examined the formation of [[superstition]] in one of his favorite experimental animals, the [[pigeon]]. Skinner placed a series of hungry pigeons in a cage attached to an automatic mechanism that delivered food to the pigeon "at regular intervals with no reference whatsoever to the bird's behavior." He discovered that the pigeons associated the delivery of the food with whatever chance actions they had been performing as it was delivered, and that they subsequently continued to perform these same actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oyc.yale.edu/economics/financial-markets/content/sessions/session-8-human-foibles-fraud-manipulation-and ECON 252, Lecture 8] by Professor Robert Schiller at Yale University&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|One bird was conditioned to turn counter-clockwise about the cage, making two or three turns between reinforcements. Another repeatedly thrust its head into one of the upper corners of the cage. A third developed a 'tossing' response, as if placing its head beneath an invisible bar and lifting it repeatedly. Two birds developed a pendulum motion of the head and body, in which the head was extended forward and swung from right to left with a sharp movement followed by a somewhat slower return.&lt;ref name=superstition&gt;Skinner, B. F. "'Superstition' in the Pigeon", ''Journal of Experimental Psychology'' #38, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Pigeon/|title=Classics in the History of Psychology -- Skinner (1948)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Skinner suggested that the pigeons behaved as if they were influencing the automatic mechanism with their "rituals", and that this experiment shed light on human behavior:

{{quote|The experiment might be said to demonstrate a sort of superstition. The bird behaves as if there were a causal relation between its behavior and the presentation of food, although such a relation is lacking. There are many analogies in human behavior. Rituals for changing one's fortune at cards are good examples. A few accidental connections between a ritual and favorable consequences suffice to set up and maintain the behavior in spite of many unreinforced instances. The bowler who has released a ball down the alley but continues to behave as if she were controlling it by twisting and turning her arm and shoulder is another case in point. These behaviors have, of course, no real effect upon one's luck or upon a ball half way down an alley, just as in the present case the food would appear as often if the pigeon did nothing—or, more strictly speaking, did something else.&lt;ref name=superstition /&gt;}}

Modern behavioral psychologists have disputed Skinner's "superstition" explanation for the behaviors he recorded. Subsequent research (e.g. Staddon and Simmelhag, 1971), while finding similar behavior, failed to find support for Skinner's "adventitious reinforcement" explanation for it. By looking at the timing of different behaviors within the interval, Staddon and Simmelhag were able to distinguish two classes of behavior: the ''terminal response'', which occurred in anticipation of food, and ''interim responses'', that occurred earlier in the interfood interval and were rarely contiguous with food. Terminal responses seem to reflect classical (as opposed to operant) conditioning, rather than adventitious reinforcement, guided by a process like that observed in 1968 by Brown and Jenkins in their "autoshaping" procedures. The causation of interim activities (such as the schedule-induced [[polydipsia]] seen in a similar situation with rats) also cannot be traced to adventitious reinforcement and its details are still obscure (Staddon, 1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The basis of superstitious behavior: chance contingency, stimulus substitution, or appetitive behavior?|first1=W|last1=Timberlake|first2=G A|last2=Lucas|date=November 1, 1985|publisher=|journal=J Exp Anal Behav|volume=44|issue=3|pages=279–299|doi=10.1901/jeab.1985.44-279|pmid=4086972|pmc=1348192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

=== J. E. R. Staddon ===
As understood by Skinner, ascribing ''dignity'' to individuals involves giving them credit for their actions. To say "Skinner is brilliant" means that Skinner is an originating force. If Skinner's [[determinism|determinist]] theory is right, he is merely the focus of his environment. He is not an originating force and he had no choice in saying the things he said or doing the things he did. Skinner's environment and genetics both allowed and compelled him to write his book. Similarly, the environment and genetic potentials of the advocates of freedom and dignity cause them to resist the reality that their own activities are deterministically grounded. [[J. E. R. Staddon]] (''The New Behaviorism, 2nd Edition'', 2014) has argued the [[Compatibilism|compatibilist position]]; Skinner's determinism is not in any way contradictory to traditional notions of reward and punishment, as he believed.&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, J. (1995) On responsibility and punishment. ''The Atlantic Monthly'', Feb., 88−94. Staddon, J. (1999) On responsibility in science and law. ''Social Philosophy and Policy'', 16, 146-174. Reprinted in ''Responsibility''. E. F. Paul, F. D. Miller, &amp; J. Paul (eds.), 1999. Cambridge University Press, pp. 146−174.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Noam Chomsky ===
[[Noam Chomsky]], a prominent critic of Skinner, published a [[Verbal Behavior#Chomsky's review|review]] of Skinner's ''[[Verbal Behavior (book)|Verbal Behavior]]'' two years after it was published.&lt;ref name="Chomsky review"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|authorlink=Noam Chomsky|year=1959|title=Reviews: ''Verbal behavior'' by B. F. Skinner|url=http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm|journal=[[Language (journal)|Language]]|volume=35|issue=1|pages=26–58|jstor=411334|doi=10.2307/411334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky argued that Skinner's attempt to use behaviorism to explain human language amounted to little more than word games. Conditioned responses could not account for a child's ability to create or understand an infinite variety of novel sentences. Chomsky's review has been credited with launching the [[cognitive revolution]] in psychology and other disciplines&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;see Chomsky page for citation&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;. Skinner, who rarely responded directly to critics, never formally replied to Chomsky's critique. Many years later, [[Kenneth MacCorquodale]]'s reply was endorsed by Skinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacCorquodale|first=Kenneth|date=1970-01-01|title=ON CHOMSKY'S REVIEW OF SKINNER'S VERBAL BEHAVIOR|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1901/jeab.1970.13-83/abstract|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=83–99|doi=10.1901/jeab.1970.13-83|issn=1938-3711|pmc=1333660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky also reviewed Skinner's ''Beyond Freedom and Dignity'', using the same basic motives as his ''Verbal Behavior'' review. Among Chomsky's criticisms were that Skinner's laboratory work could not be extended to humans, that when it was extended to humans it represented '[[Scientism|scientistic]]' behavior attempting to emulate science but which was not scientific, that Skinner was not a scientist because he rejected the [[hypothetico-deductive model]] of theory testing, and that Skinner had no science of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Chomsky, (1972) "The Case Against B. F. Skinner."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychodynamic psychology ===
Skinner has been repeatedly criticized for his supposed animosity towards [[Sigmund Freud]], [[psychoanalysis]], and [[psychodynamic psychology]]. Some have argued, however, that Skinner shared several of Freud's assumptions, and that he was influenced by Freudian points of view in more than one field, among them the analysis of [[defense mechanisms]], such as [[Psychological repression|repression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toates |first=F. |year=2009 |title=Burrhus F.

'''Behaviorally anchored rating scales''' ('''BARS''') are [[scale (social sciences)|scales]] used to rate [[job performance|performance]]. BARS are normally presented vertically with scale points ranging from five to nine. It is an appraisal method that aims to combine the benefits of narratives, critical incidents, and quantified ratings by anchoring a quantified scale with specific narrative examples of good, moderate, and poor performance.&lt;ref&gt;Management of Human Resources, Gary Dessler{{pn|date=November 2016}}{{full|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
BARS were developed in response to dissatisfaction with the subjectivity involved in using traditional rating scales such as the graphic rating [[scale (social sciences)|scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0047060 |title=Retranslation of expectations: An approach to the construction of unambiguous anchors for rating scales |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=149–55 |year=1963 |last1=Smith |first1=Patricia Cain |last2=Kendall |first2=L. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of BARS concluded that the strength of this rating format may lie primarily in the performance dimensions which are gathered rather than the distinction between behavioral and numerical scale anchors.&lt;ref name="shd"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1975.tb01392.x |title=Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales: A Review of the Literature |journal=Personnel Psychology |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=549–62 |year=1975 |last1=Schwab |first1=Donald P. |last2=Heneman |first2=Herbert G. |last3=Decotiis |first3=Thomas A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of BARS==
BARS are rating scales that add behavioral scale anchors to traditional rating scales (e.g., graphic rating scales). In comparison to other rating scales, BARS are intended to facilitate more accurate ratings of the target person's behavior or performance. However, whereas the BARS is often regarded as a superior [[performance appraisal]] method, BARS may still suffer from [[reliability (statistics)|unreliability]], [[leniency bias]] and lack of [[discriminant validity]] between performance dimensions.&lt;ref name="shd"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1744-6570.1981.tb00942.x |title=A Critical Analysis of Studies Comparing Behaviorally Anchored Rating Scales (Bars) and Other Rating Formats |journal=Personnel Psychology |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=263–89 |year=1981 |last1=Kingstrom |first1=Paul O. |last2=Bass |first2=Alan R. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developing BARS==
BARS are developed using data collected through the [[critical incident technique]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/h0061470 |pmid=13177800 |title=The critical incident technique |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=327–58 |year=1954 |last1=Flanagan |first1=John C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; or through the use of comprehensive data about the tasks performed by a job incumbent, such as might be collected through a task analysis. In order to construct BARS, several basic steps, outlined below, Is followed.
# Examples of effective and ineffective behavior related to job are collected from people with knowledge of job using the critical incident technique. Alternatively, data may be collected through the careful examination of data from a recent task analysis.
# These data are then converted into performance dimensions. To convert these data into performance dimensions, examples of behavior (such as critical incidents) are sorted into homogeneous groups using the Q-sort technique. Definitions for each group of behaviors are then written to define each grouping of behaviors as a performance dimension
# A group of subject matter experts (SMEs) are asked to re-translate the behavioral examples back into their respective performance dimensions. At this stage the behaviors for which there is not a high level of agreement (often 50–75%) are discarded while the behaviors which were re-translated back into their respective performance dimensions with a high level of SME agreement are retained. The re-translation process helps to ensure that behaviors are readily identifiable with their respective performance dimensions.
# The retained behaviors are then scaled by having SMEs rate the effectiveness of each behavior. These ratings are usually done on a 5- to 9-point Likert-type scale.
# Behaviors with a low [[standard deviation]] (for examples, less than 1.50) are retained while behaviors with a higher standard deviation are discarded. This step helps to ensure SME agreement about the rating of each behavior.
# Finally, behaviors for each performance dimensions, all meeting re-translation and criteria, will be used as scale anchors.

The use of biomass in [[heating system]]s is beneficial because it uses agricultural, forest, urban and industrial residues and waste to produce heat and electricity with less effect on the [[Natural environment|environment]] than fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vallios | first1 = I | last2 = Tsoutsos | first2 = T | last3 = Papadakis | first3 = G | year = 2009 | title = Design of Biomass District Heating | url = | journal = Biomass &amp; Bioenergy | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 659–678 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of energy production has a limited long-term effect on the environment because the carbon in biomass is part of the natural [[carbon cycle]]; while the carbon in fossil fuels is not, and permanently adds carbon to the environment when burned for fuel ([[carbon footprint]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Wood Fuelled Heating |url= http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generate-your-own-energy/Wood-fuelled-heating |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716153317/http://www.energysavingtrust.org.uk/Generate-your-own-energy/Wood-fuelled-heating |archivedate= 16 July 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, before the use of [[fossil fuels]] in significant quantities, biomass in the form of [[wood fuel]] provided most of humanity's heating.

==Drawbacks of biomass heating==
On a large scale, the use of biomass removes [[agricultural land]] from [[food production]], reduces the [[carbon sequestration]] capacity of forests, and extracts [[soil nutrient|nutrients]] from the soil. Combustion of biomass creates [[air pollutant]]s and adds significant quantities of carbon to the atmosphere that may not be returned to the soil for many decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/about-us/governance/scientific-committee/sc-opinions/opinions-on-scientific-issues/sc-opinion-on-greenhouse-gas |title=Opinion of the EEA Scientific Committee on Greenhouse Gas Accounting in Relation to Bioenergy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using biomass as a fuel produces air pollution in the form of [[carbon monoxide]], [[NOx]] (nitrogen oxides), VOCs ([[volatile organic compound]]s), particulates and other pollutants, in some cases at levels above those from traditional fuel sources such as coal or natural gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal |title=George Lopez visits the Fox Theatre |publisher=Michigan Messenger |date=22 February 1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205080916/http://michiganmessenger.com/33868/proposed-biomass-plant-better-than-coal |archivedate=5 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1892127 | pmid=17589590 | doi=10.1289/ehp.9479 | volume=115 | issue=6 | title=Household air pollution from coal and biomass fuels in China: measurements, health impacts, and interventions |date=June 2007 | journal=Environ. Health Perspect. | pages=848–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Black carbon]] – a pollutant created by incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels, and biomass – is possibly the second largest contributor to global warming.&lt;ref&gt;''2009 State of the World, Into a Warming World'','''Worldwatch Institute''', 56–57, {{ISBN|978-0-393-33418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009 a Swedish study of the giant brown haze that periodically covers large areas in South Asia determined that it had been principally produced by biomass burning, and to a lesser extent by fossil-fuel burning.&lt;ref&gt;''Science'', '''2009''', 323, 495&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers measured a significant concentration of [[Carbon-14|&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C]], which is associated with recent plant life rather than with fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;''Biomass burning leads to Asian brown cloud'', [[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]], '''87''', 4, 31&lt;/ref&gt;

On combustion, the carbon from biomass is released into the atmosphere as [[carbon dioxide|carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]]. The amount of carbon stored in dry wood is approximately 50% by weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uvm.edu/~jcjenkin/smith%20et%20al.%202003.pdf |title=Forest volume-to-biomass models and estimates of mass for live and standing dead trees of U.S. forests |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711174829/http://www.uvm.edu/~jcjenkin/smith%20et%20al.%202003.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; When from agricultural sources, plant matter used as a fuel can be replaced by planting for new growth. When the biomass is from forests, the time to recapture the carbon stored is generally longer, and the carbon storage capacity of the forest may be reduced overall if destructive forestry techniques are employed.&lt;ref name="fao-prasad"&gt;{{cite web|last=Prasad|first=Ram|title=SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT FOR DRY FORESTS OF SOUTH ASIA|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/003/X6895E/x6895e04.htm|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foeitreetr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Treetrouble: Testimonies on the Negative Impact of Large-scale Tree Plantations prepared for the sixth Conference of the Parties of the Framework Convention on Climate Change|url=http://www.foei.org/en/resources/forests/treetrouble.html|publisher=Friends of the Earth International|accessdate=11 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726122033/http://www.foei.org/en/resources/forests/treetrouble.html|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usda-laihoetal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Impacts of intensive forestry on early rotation trends in site carbon pools in the southeastern US|url=http://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/pubs/5295|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=11 August 2010|author=Laiho, Raija|author2=Sanchez, Felipe |author3=Tiarks, Allan |author4=Dougherty, Phillip M. |author5= Trettin, Carl C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fao-towsusman"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE FINANCIAL AND INSTITUTIONAL FEASIBILITY OF SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT|url=http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/003/X4107E/X4107E04.htm#P866_112288|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biomass-is-carbon-neutral proposal put forward in the early 1990s has been superseded by more recent science that recognizes that mature, intact forests sequester carbon more effectively than cut-over areas. When a tree’s carbon is released into the atmosphere in a single pulse, it contributes to climate change much more than woodland timber rotting slowly over decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Biomass heating in our world==
[[File:Olarizu - Casa de la Dehesa - Central de biomasa 01.jpg|thumb|Biomass heating system for one building complex in the Spanish Basque Country]]
The [[oil price increases since 2003]] and consequent price increases for natural gas and coal have increased the value of biomass for heat generation. Forest renderings, agricultural waste, and [[energy crop|crops grown specifically for energy]] production become competitive as the prices of [[Energy density|energy dense]] fossil fuels rise.  Efforts to develop this potential may have the effect of [[Land reclamation#Repairing damaged land|regenerating mismanaged croplands]] and be a cog in the wheel of a decentralized, multi-dimensional [[renewable energy industry]].  Efforts to promote and advance these methods became common throughout the [[European Union]] through the 2000s. In other areas of the world, inefficient and polluting means to generate heat from biomass coupled with poor forest practices have significantly added to [[environmental degradation]].

==Buffer tanks==

Buffer tanks store the hot water the biomass appliance generates and circulates it around the heating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.treco.co.uk/products/type/buffertank/2|title=Buffer Tanks and Hot Water Storage - Treco|website=www.treco.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as 'thermal stores', they are crucial for the efficient operation of all biomass boilers where the system loading fluctuates rapidly, or the volume of water in the complete hydraulic system is relatively small. Using a suitably sized buffer vessel prevents rapid cycling of the boiler when the loading is below the minimum boiler output. Rapid cycling of the boiler causes a large increase in harmful emissions such as [[Carbon monoxide]], dust, and [[NOx]], greatly reduces boiler efficiency and increases electrical consumption of the unit. In addition, service and maintenance requirements will be increased as parts are stressed by rapid heating and cooling cycles. Although most boilers claim to be able to turn down to 30% of nominal output, in the real world this is often not achievable due to differences in the fuel from the 'ideal' or test fuel. A suitably sized buffer tank should therefore be considered where the loading of the boiler drops below 50% of the nominal output – in other words unless the biomass component is purely base load, the system should include a buffer tank. In any case where the secondary system does not contain sufficient water for safe removal of residual heat from the biomass boiler irrespective of the loading conditions, the system must include a suitably sized buffer tank. The [[residual heat]] from a biomass unit varies greatly depending on the boiler design and the thermal mass of the combustion chamber. Light weight, fast response boilers require only 10L/kW, while industrial wet wood units with very high thermal mass require 40L/kW.&lt;ref name="Buffer tanks"&gt;{{cite web |title=Buffer tanks |url= http://www.mbaxterbiomass.co.uk/services/buffer.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of biomass heating systems==
[[File:Biomasseheizwerk Spillern Nordansicht.jpg|thumb|Biomass [[Heat-only boiler station|heating plant]] in Austria; the heat power is about 1000 kW]]

The use of Biomass in heating systems has a use in many different types of buildings, and all have different uses. There are four main types of heating systems that use biomass to heat a boiler. The types are Fully Automated, Semi-Automated, Pellet-Fired, and Combined Heat and Power.

===Fully automated===
In fully automated systems chipped or ground up waste wood is brought to the site by delivery trucks and dropped into a holding tank. A system of conveyors then transports the wood from the holding tank to the boiler at a certain managed rate. This rate is managed by computer controls and a laser that measures the load of fuel the conveyor is bringing in. The system automatically goes on and off to maintain the pressure and temperature within the boiler. Fully automated systems offer a great deal of ease in their operation because they only require the operator of the system to control the computer, and not the transport of wood while offering comprehensive and cost effective solutions to complex industrial challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sigmathermal.com/automation|title=Automation: Combustion Control &amp; Burner Management Systems|newspaper=Sigma Thermal|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Types of Biomass Heating Systems"&gt;{{cite web |title=Types of Biomass Heating Systems |url= http://www.hurstboiler.com/biomass_boiler_systems/heating_system_types/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semi-automated or "surge bin"===
Semi-automated or "Surge Bin" systems are very similar to fully automated systems except they require more manpower to keep operational. They have smaller holding tanks, and a much simpler conveyor systems which will require personnel to maintain the systems operation. The reasoning for the changes from the fully automated system is the efficiency of the system. The heat created by the combustor can be used to directly heat the air or it can be used to heat water in a boiler system which acts as the medium by which the heat is delivered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://selectedecoenergy.co.uk/biomass-system-design/|title=Biomass System Design - Selected Eco Energy|newspaper=Selected Eco Energy|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood fire fueled boilers are most efficient when they are running at their highest capacity, and the heat required most days of the year will not be the peak heat requirement for the year. Considering that the system will only need to run at a high capacity a few days of the year, it is made to meet the requirements for the majority of the year to maintain its high efficiency.&lt;ref name="Types of Biomass Heating Systems"/&gt;

===Pellet-fired===
The third main type of biomass heating systems are [[Pellet fuel|pellet]]-fired systems. Pellets are a processed form of wood, which make them more expensive. Although they are more expensive, they are much more condensed and uniform, and therefore are more efficient. Further, it is relatively easy to automatically feed pellets to boilers.  In these systems, the pellets are stored in a grain-type storage silo, and gravity is used to move them to the boiler. The storage requirements are much smaller for pellet-fired systems because of their condensed nature, which also helps cut down costs. these systems are used for a wide variety of facilities, but they are most efficient and cost effective for places where space for storage and conveyor systems is limited, and where the pellets are made fairly close to the facility.&lt;ref name="Types of Biomass Heating Systems"/&gt;

====Agricultural pellet systems====
One subcategory of pellet systems are boilers or burners capable of burning pellet with higher ash rate (paper pellets, hay pellets, [[straw pellets]]). One of this kind is PETROJET pellet burner with rotating cylindrical burning chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horakypetrojet.cz/news/great-results-from-swedish-testing-laboratory |title=Great results from Swedish testing laboratory &amp;#124; Petrojet Trade s.r.o |publisher=Horakypetrojet.cz }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of efficiencies advanced pellet boilers can exceed other forms of biomass because of the more stable fuel charataristics. Advanced pellet boilers can even work in condensing mode and cool down combustion gases to 30-40&amp;nbsp;°C, instead of 120&amp;nbsp;°C before sent into the flue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.okofen.co.uk/en/pellematic_plus/#tab2|title=Okofen condesing pellet boiler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Combined heat and power===
[[Combined heat and power]] systems are very useful systems in which wood waste, such as [[wood chips]], is used to generate power, and heat is created as a byproduct of the power generation system. They have a very high cost because of the high pressure operation. Because of this high pressure operation, the need for a highly trained operator is mandatory, and will raise the cost of operation. Another drawback is that while they produce electricity they will produce heat, and if producing heat is not desirable for certain parts of the year, the addition of a cooling tower is necessary, and will also raise the cost.

There are certain situations where CHP is a good option. Wood product manufacturers would use a combined heat and power system because they have a large supply of waste wood, and a need for both heat and power. Other places where these systems would be optimal are hospitals and prisons, which need energy, and heat for hot water. These systems are sized so that they will produce enough heat to match the average heat load so that no additional heat is needed, and a cooling tower is not needed.&lt;ref name="Types of Biomass Heating Systems"/&gt;

* Internal [[grievance]] procedures are commonly not impartial and are open to [[abuses of power]] - the bully himself may have a close relationship with the investigating party and there may be [[conflicts of interest]] (see [[quasi-judicial]])
* Complaining against the bully may only make the bullying worse and the victim may fear repercussions
* Victims often conclude that the only solution is to leave the company or the Information Technology industry altogether
* IT professionals may be technically brilliant but often lack social skills ([[soft skills]])
* Some managers may be technically "hands-off" and feel threatened by the technical skills of their subordinates
* There is often a culture of [[cronyism]], [[protectionism]] and [http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/212000.html jobs for the boys]
* Middle managers are prone to being bullied from above and/or below in the hierarchy
* A high percentage of senior IT management possess very poor [[people skills]] or may have a [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] personality
* [[Mediation]] needs to be done by a fully trained impartial external mediator with a good track record, which are not available at most workplaces
* A system to report bullying anonymously may be helpful
* Victims often have [[misplaced loyalty]] with a company and stay too long [[trusting]] that they would get support
* Bullying in IT is often encouraged and institutionalized as a way of boosting competitiveness among employees 
* Information Technology bullies may use their advanced computer skills to hack into their victim's computers and/or participate in [[cyberbullying]] against their victim

'''Categorization''' is the process in which ideas and objects are recognized, differentiated, and understood.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, H., &amp; Lefebvre, C. (Eds.). (2005).[https://books.google.com/books?id=5WDfl14RgKMC ''Handbook of Categorization in Cognitive Science'']. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; Categorization implies that objects are grouped into categories, usually for some specific purpose. Ideally, a category illuminates a [[Binary relation|relationship]] between the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]s and [[object (philosophy)|object]]s of knowledge. Categorization is fundamental in language, prediction, [[inference]], decision making and in all kinds of environmental interaction. It is indicated that categorization plays a major role in [[computer programming]].&lt;ref&gt;Frey, T., Gelhausen, M., &amp; Saake (2011).[http://ecs.victoria.ac.nz/twiki/pub/Events/PLATEAU/Program/plateau2011-frey.pdf '' Categorization of Concerns – A Categorical Program Comprehension Model. In Proceedings of the Workshop on Evaluation and Usability of Programming Languages and Tools (PLATEAU) at the ACM Onward! and SPLASH Conferences. October, 2011. Portland, Oregon, USA''].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many categorization theories and techniques. In a broader historical view, however, three general approaches to categorization may be identified:
* Classical categorization
* Conceptual clustering
* Prototype theory

==The classical view==
{{main|Categories (Aristotle)}}
'''Classical categorization''' first appears in the context of [[Western Philosophy]] in the work of [[Plato]], who, in his [[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]] dialogue, introduces the approach of grouping objects based on their similar [[Property (philosophy)|properties]]. This approach was further explored and systematized by [[Aristotle]] in his [[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]] treatise, where he analyzes the differences between [[Class (philosophy)|class]]es and [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s. Aristotle also applied intensively the classical categorization scheme in his approach to the classification of living beings (which uses the technique of applying successive narrowing questions such as "Is it an animal or vegetable?", "How many feet does it have?", "Does it have fur or feathers?", "Can it fly?"...), establishing this way the basis for [[natural kind|natural]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].

The classical [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] view claims that categories are discrete entities characterized by a set of properties which are shared by their members. In [[analytic philosophy]], these properties are assumed to establish the conditions which are both [[necessary and sufficient condition]]s to capture meaning.

According to the classical view, categories should be clearly defined, mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. This way, any entity of the given classification universe belongs unequivocally to one, and only one, of the proposed categories.

==Conceptual clustering==
{{main|Conceptual clustering}}
'''Conceptual clustering''' is a modern variation of the classical approach, and derives from attempts to explain how knowledge is represented. In this approach, [[Class (philosophy)|class]]es (clusters or entities) are generated by first formulating their conceptual descriptions and then classifying the entities according to the descriptions.

Conceptual clustering developed mainly during the 1980s, as a [[machine learning|machine]] paradigm for [[unsupervised learning]]. It is distinguished from ordinary [[Cluster analysis|data clustering]] by generating a concept description for each generated category.

Categorization tasks in which category labels are provided to the learner for certain objects are referred to as supervised classification, [[supervised learning]], or [[concept learning]]. Categorization tasks in which no labels are supplied are referred to as unsupervised classification, [[unsupervised learning]], or [[Cluster analysis|data clustering]]. The task of supervised classification involves extracting information from the labeled examples that allows accurate prediction of class labels of future examples. This may involve the [[abstraction]] of a rule or concept relating observed object features to category labels, or it may not involve abstraction (e.g., [[Exemplar theory|exemplar model]]s). The task of clustering involves recognizing inherent structure in a data set and grouping objects together by similarity into classes. It is thus a process of ''generating'' a classification structure.

Conceptual clustering is closely related to [[fuzzy set]] theory, in which objects may belong to one or more groups, in varying degrees of fitness.

==Prototype theory==
{{main|Prototype theory}}
Since the research by [[Eleanor Rosch]] and [[George Lakoff]] in the 1970s, categorization can also be viewed as the process of grouping things based on [[prototype]]s—the idea of necessary and sufficient conditions is almost never met in categories of naturally occurring things. It has also been suggested that categorization based on prototypes is the basis for human development, and that this learning relies on learning about the world via [[embodied cognition|embodiment]].

A [[cognition|cognitive]] approach accepts that natural categories are graded (they tend to be [[fuzzy concept|fuzzy]] at their boundaries) and inconsistent in the status of their constituent members.

Systems of categories are not objectively "out there" in the world but are rooted in people's experience. Conceptual categories are not identical for different cultures, or indeed, for every individual in the same culture.

Categories form part of a hierarchical structure when applied to such subjects as [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] in [[biological classification]]: higher level: life-form level, middle level: generic or [[genus]] level, and lower level: the [[species]] level. These can be distinguished by certain traits that put an item in its distinctive category. But even these can be arbitrary and are subject to revision.

Categories at the middle level are perceptually and conceptually the more salient. The generic level of a category tends to elicit the most responses and richest images and seems to be the psychologically basic level. Typical taxonomies in zoology for example exhibit categorization at the [[embodied cognition|embodied]] level, with similarities leading to formulation of "higher" categories, and differences leading to differentiation within categories.

== Miscategorization ==
{{main|Category mistake}}
{{unref-sect|date=November 2017}}
Miscategorization can be a [[Fallacy|logical fallacy]] in which diverse and dissimilar objects, concepts, entities, etc. are grouped together based upon illogical common denominators, or common denominators that virtually any concept, object or entity have in common. A common way miscategorization occurs is through an over-categorization of concepts, objects or entities, and then miscategorization based upon characters that virtually all things have in common.

The '''chilling requirement''' of a fruit is the minimum period of cold [[weather]] after which a [[fruit-bearing tree]] will [[blossom]].  It is often expressed in chill hours, which can be calculated in different ways, all of which essentially involve adding up the total amount of time in a winter spent at certain temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://etweather.tamu.edu/chill/ | publisher = Texas A&amp;M University Agricultural Research &amp; Extension Center at Overton | title = Chilling hours}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ent.uga.edu/peach/peachhbk/pdf/physiology.pdf | title = Peach tree physiology | author = David W. Lockwood and D. C. Coston | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100610090104/http://www.ent.uga.edu/peach/peachhbk/pdf/physiology.pdf | archivedate = 2010-06-10 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some bulbs have chilling requirements to bloom, and some seeds have chilling requirements to sprout.

Biologically, the chilling requirement is a way of ensuring that [[vernalization]] occurs.

== Chilling units or chilling hours ==
A ''chilling unit'' in [[agriculture]] is a metric of a plant's exposure to chilling temperatures. Chilling temperatures extend from [[Melting point|freezing point]] to, depending on the model, {{convert|45|F|C|order=flip}} or even {{convert|60|°F|°C|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name=BB&gt;Byrne, D. H., and T. A. Bacon (1992). ''[http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/stonefruit/chillacc.html Chilling estimation: its importance and estimation]''. The Texas Horticulturist 18(8):5, 8-9. Retrieved 2010-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drupe|Stone fruit]] trees and certain other plants of [[Temperateness|temperate climate]] develop next year's [[bud]]s in the summer. In the autumn the buds become [[dormancy|dormant]], and the switch to proper, healthy dormancy is triggered by a certain minimum exposure to chilling temperatures. Lack of such exposure results in delayed and substandard foliation, flowering and fruiting. One chilling unit, in the simplest models, is equal to one hour's exposure to the chilling temperature; these units are summed up for a whole season. Advanced models assign different weights to different temperature bands.

==Requirements==

According to Fishman, chilling in trees acts in two stages. The first is reversible: chilling helps to build up the [[precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] to dormancy, but the process can be easily reversed with a rise in temperature. After the level of precursor reaches a certain threshold, dormancy becomes irreversible and will not be affected by short-term warm temperature peaks.&lt;ref name=SO/&gt; [[Apple]]s have the highest chilling requirements of all fruit trees, followed by [[apricot]]s and, lastly, [[peach]]es. Apple [[cultivar]]s have a diverse range of permissible minimum chilling: most have been bred for temperate weather, but ''[[Gala (apple)|Gala]]'' and ''[[Fuji (apple)|Fuji]]'' can be successfully grown in subtropical [[Bakersfield, California]].&lt;ref name=H87&gt;Hall, Anthony (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vmNKZ4t7mH8C Crop responses to environment]''. CRC Press. {{ISBN|0-8493-1028-8}}. p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peach cultivars in [[Texas]] range in their requirements from 100 chilling units (''Florida Grande'' cultivar, zoned for low chill regions) to 1,000 units (''Surecrop'', zoned for high chill regions).&lt;ref name=KA&gt;Kamas, J.; McEachern, J. R; Stein, L.; Roe, N. (1998). ''[http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/extension/peach/peach.html Peach Production in Texas]'', table 1. Texas A&amp;M University. Retrieved 2010-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Planting a low-chilling cultivar in a high-chill region risks loss of a year's harvest when an early bloom is hit by a spring frost.&lt;ref name=KA/&gt; A high-chilling cultivar planted in a low-chill region will, quite likely, never fruit at all. A four-year study of ''Ruston Red'' [[Alabama]] peach, which has a threshold of 850 chilling units, demonstrated that a seasonal chilling deficiency of less than 50 units has no effect on harvest. Deficiency of 50 to 100 units may result in loss of up to 50% of expected harvest. Deficiency of 250 hours and more is a sure loss of practically whole harvest; the few fruit will be of very poor quality and have no market value.&lt;ref name=PO&gt;Powell, A. (1999). ''[http://www.aces.edu/dept/peaches/peachdormex.html Action Program for Dormex Application on Peaches]''. [[Auburn University]]. Retrieved 2010-05-24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rest-breaking agent]]s (e.g. [[cyanamide|hydrogen cyanamide]], trade name ''BudPro or Dormex''), applied in spring, can partially mitigate the effects of insufficient chilling. BudPro can substitute for up to 300 hours of chilling, but an excessive spraying and timing error can easily damage the buds.&lt;ref name=PO/&gt;
Other products such as Dormex use stabilizing compounds.

Chilling of [[Orange (fruit)|orange trees]] has two effects. First, it increases production of [[carotenoid]]s and decreases [[chlorophyll]] content of the fruit, improving their appearance and, ultimately, their market value. Second, the "quasi-dormancy" experienced by orange trees triggers concentrated flowering in spring, as opposed to more or less uniform round-the-year flowering and fruiting in warmer climates.&lt;ref name=H87/&gt;

[[Biennial plant]]s like [[cabbage]], [[sugar beet]], [[celery]] and [[carrot]]s need chilling to develop second-year flowering buds. Excessive chilling in the early stages of a sugar beet seedling, on the contrary, may trigger undesired growth of a flowering stem ([[Bolting (horticulture)|bolting]]) in its first year. This phenomenon has been offset by breeding sugar beet cultivars with a higher minimum chilling threshold. Such cultivars can be seeded earlier than normal without the risk of bolting.&lt;ref name=H87/&gt;

==Models==

All models require hourly recording of temperatures.&lt;ref name=SO/&gt; The simplest model assigns one chilling unit for every full hour at temperatures below {{convert|45|F|C|order=flip}}. A slightly more sophisticated model excludes freezing temperatures, which do not contribute to proper dormancy cycle, and counts only hours with temperatures between {{convert|32|F|C|order=flip}} and {{convert|45|F|C|order=flip}}.&lt;ref name=BB/&gt;
 
The Utah model assigns different weight to different temperature bands; a full unit per hour is assigned only to temperatures between {{convert|37|F|C|order=flip}} and {{convert|48|F|C|order=flip}}. Maximum effect is achieved at {{convert|7|C|F}}.&lt;ref name=SO/&gt; Temperatures between {{convert|55|F|C|order=flip}} and {{convert|60|F|C|order=flip}} (the threshold between chilling and warm weather) have zero weight, and higher temperature have negative weights: they reduce the beneficial effects of an already accumulated chilling hours.&lt;ref name=BB/&gt;

Southwick et al. wrote that neither of these models is accurate enough to account for application of [[rest-breaking agent]]s widely used in modern farming. They advocated the use of a dynamic model tailored to the two-stage explanation of dormancy.&lt;ref name=SO&gt;Southwick, S.; Khan, Z.; Glozer, K. (2003).

The '''Chubb illusion''' is an [[optical illusion]] or error in [[visual perception]] in which the apparent [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]] of an object varies substantially to most viewers depending on its relative contrast to the field on which it is displayed.&lt;ref name="swerve"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lotto |first1=R. Beau |last2=Purves |first2=Dale |title=An Empirical Explanation of the Chubb Illusion |journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience |volume=13 |issue=5 |date=July 2001 |pmid=11506656
|pages=547–55 |url=http://www.mind.duke.edu/files/sites/purves/pub/3551328687.pdf |doi=10.1162/089892901750363154}}&lt;/ref&gt; These visual illusions are of particular interest to researchers because they may provide valuable insights in regard to the workings of human [[visual system]]s.

An object of low-contrast visual texture surrounded by a field of uniform visual texture appears to have higher contrast than when presented on a field of high-contrast texture. This illusion was observed by Charles Chubb and colleagues and published in 1989.&lt;ref name="Chubb"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chubb |first1=C |last2=Sperling |first2=G |last3=Solomon |first3=JA |title=Texture interactions determine perceived contrast |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA  |date=December 1989 |volume=86 |issue=23 |pages=9631–5 |doi=10.1073/pnas.86.23.9631 |pmid=2594791 |pmc=298552}}&lt;/ref&gt; An empirical explanation of the Chubb illusion was published by Lotto and Purves in 2001.&lt;ref name="swerve"/&gt;

==Discovery==
[[File:Simultaneous contrast.png|thumb|Figure 2: Illustration of simultaneous contrast]]
Chubb and his colleagues researched this illusion by showing various combinations of foreground objects and background fields to human test subjects and asking them to rate the sharpness of the visual contrast in each foreground object. They found that subjects viewing a patch of random visual texture embedded in a surrounding background field were likely to report different perceptions of visual [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] for the central target patch depending on the relative contrast of the background field. Furthermore, the apparent brightness/ dullness of a texture patch varied as the background varied. E.g. bright points of texture patch appeared duller in a high-contrast background, whereas dark points appeared lighter in an even background.&lt;ref name="Chubb" /&gt; This apparent variance in perception is influenced when it is viewed by different observers and when the background and central target patch are placed on “non-overlapping spatial frequency bands”, as explained by Chubb et al. This tendency was found statistically [[significance (statistics)|significant]]. Theories point to a perceptual tool to catalyse contrast adaptation (slow, seconds) to contrast gain control (fast,≈100ms) at an early cortical or pre-cortical ‘neural locus’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/lum-contrastAdapt/index.html|title=Contrast Gain Control|last=Bach|first=Michael|website=www.michaelbach.de|language=en|access-date=2017-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chubb" /&gt;

== Chubb contrast effect ==
The Chubb illusion is similar to another visual illusion, the [[contrast effect]]. The contrast effect is an illusion in which the perceived brightness or [[luminance]] of an identical central visual target form on a larger uniform background varies to the test subject depending on the ratio of the central form's luminance to that of its background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wallach |first=H |title= Brightness constancy and the nature of achromatic colors |journal= J Exp Psychol |volume=38 |issue=3 |year=1948 |pages=310–24 |pmid=
18865234 |doi=10.1037/h0053804
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This illusion, [[contrast effect|simultaneous contrast]], is illustrated in Figure 2. In it, the central target is brighter. I.e., the ratio of the top central rectangle’s luminance ('''A''') to its background field's luminance is greater than one. In the bottom rectangle ('''B'''), the background field is brighter. That is, the ratio is less than one.&lt;ref name="Chubb" /&gt; Although the two central target patches are equally bright (identical in luminance) the one on a dark background appears lighter and the one on a lighter background appears darker.

== Lateral inhibition ==
[[Lateral inhibition]] is one proposal to explain the [[contrast effect|contrast]] illusion or simultaneous contrast. Its advocates theorize that neurons strongly stimulated by the background of '''B''' suppress the less strongly stimulated neurons of the interior rectangle.&lt;ref name="Chubb" /&gt; In '''A''', they theorize, there is no such inhibition. However, the fact that both '''A''' and '''B''' appear of "uniform lightness across their expanse" suggests that the process of lateral inhibition is more complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grossberg |first1=S. |last2=Todorovic |first2=D. |title=Neural dynamics of 1-D and 2-D brightness perception: a unified model of classical and recent phenomena. |journal=Percept Psychophys |volume=43 |issue=3 |year=1988 |pages=241–77 |pmid=3347487 |doi=10.3758/bf03207869}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chubb et al. assert that the principle of lateral inhibition rests on the assumption that the determining factor of perceived lightness is the ratio, at the rectangle edge, of rectangle luminance to background luminance.&lt;ref name="Chubb" /&gt; However, the lateral inhibition account is not consistent with phenomena such as the Benary cross and White's illusion as well as transparency and assimilation effects. As such, it is an ad hoc explanation of unclear theoretical interest.

The Chubb illusion illustrates an error in contrast rather than luminance. The zero-luminance background of Figure 2 ('''A''') becomes a zero-contrast field in the analogous portion of Figure 1, while the high-luminance field of Figure 2 ('''B''') becomes a high-contrast texture field. Observers empirically perceive the texture disk of the leftmost portion of Figure 1 as having higher contrast than the disk on the right, even though the two are the same. After conducting experiments on contrast and lightness induction, interocular induction and induction between spatial frequency bands, they show that lateral inhibitory effect is monocular and adapted only for spatial frequency. Chubb et al. support "a model in which the output gain of such a band-selective [[neuron]] is normalized relative to the average response [[amplitude]] of nearby neurons with the same [[frequency]] tuning." &lt;ref name="Chubb" /&gt;

==Imperfect transmittance ==
[[File:Lotto and Purves.png|thumb|left|Figure 3: The Chubb Illusion]]
Visual perceptions are dependent on the interaction of the human visual system with any bi-stable or multi-stable stimuli and the frequency of its occurrence.  The lighting of objects at a point, the reflectance of those objects and the transmittance of media between the object and observer is central to determining the primary factors that affect our visual perception.&lt;ref name="swerve" /&gt; It is due to this that a low contrast image is perceived to be of a higher contrast when placed in front of a grey background. The grey background is more ambiguous than the high contrast background. Lotto and Purves (2001) demonstrated that the Chubb illusion can be explained "by the degree to which imperfect [[transmittance]] is likely to have affected the light that reaches the eye."&lt;ref name="swerve"/&gt; Indeed, these observations suggest a wholly [[empirical]] explanation of the Chubb illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Purves |first1=Dale |title=Why we see things the way we do: evidence for a wholly empirical strategy of vision. |journal= Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=356 |issue=1407 |year=2001 |pages=285–97 |pmid=11316481 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2000.0772 |pmc=1088429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chubb effect estimates that when an object is viewed through an imperfectly transmitting medium, it increases or decreases the apparent brightness or dullness of the target patch, even when luminance ratios and spatial frequencies remain the same.&lt;ref name="swerve" /&gt; Lotto and Purves (2001) doubted that illusory perceptions of brightness were explained as consequences of [[lateral inhibition]].&lt;ref name="Chubb"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adelson |first1=E.H. |title=Light Perception and Lightness Illusions |journal=The new cognitive neurosciences |year=1999 |page=339 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wx17lC075EC&amp;pg=PA339|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-07195-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; If that were the case, the perceived difference in brightness of target elements, illustrated in Figure 3 ('''A'''), would be largely unaffected by the surrounding field in Figure 3 ('''C'''), which exhibits lower spatial contrast than the target, which matches the observations. Despite this, they asserted, "this reasoning is undermined by the fact that the apparent contrast  by the target pattern in Figure 3 ('''D''') is mostly unaffected by the surround of Figure 3 ('''F''')."  Therefore, they chose to examine the Chubb illusion in 'wholly empirical' terms, as mainly a consequence of past experience, or in this case, the influence of transmittance on ambiguous stimuli.&lt;ref name="swerve"/&gt;

The common denominator of the Lotto and Purves observations is the explanatory power of imperfect transmittance.&lt;ref name="swerve"/&gt; Imperfect transmittance causes observers to experience a reduced difference in spectral contrast or luminance from object surfaces.&lt;ref name="swerve"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Metelli |first1=F |last2=DaPos |first2=O |last3=Cavedon |first3=A |title=Balanced and unbalanced, complete and partial transparency |journal=Percept Psychophys |year=1985 |pages=354–66 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03207164?LI=true#page-1 |doi=10.3758/BF03207164 |pmid=3831912 |volume=38|issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because imperfections in the transmission medium produce, such as atmospheric effects distort transmittance. For instance, transmittance varies when viewing objects from a distance, in smog or fog, or through fabric, glass or water. These conditions greatly effect the amount of light that reaches the eye. This hypothesis was tested by altering the probable contributions of imperfect transmittance by manipulating motion, luminance and colour information. In some cases, the relative luminance of two target surfaces can be reduced, as Lotto and Purves demonstrate, from a ratio of 8:3 to approximately 7:5. If perception is generated empirically, then "the extent that a stimulus is consistent with imperfect transmittance...will be incorporated into the perception of the target."&lt;ref name="swerve"/&gt;

Appropriate behavioural response depends on the evaluation of the relative contributions of illumination, reflectance and transmittance to the visual stimuli. Visual perceptions of contrast are affected by the effects of imperfect transmittance rather than the luminance of the object.&lt;ref name="swerve" /&gt; The Chubb stimulus illustrated in Figure 1 ('''B''') is consistent with transmittance distortions for two reasons: the patterned elements of the background are continuous with the patterned elements of the target and the luminances of the target elements accord with the values that would arise if the background pattern were viewed through an imperfectly transmitting medium.&lt;ref name="swerve"/&gt;

The transmittance explanation of the Chubb illusion asserts that changing the stimulus in Figure 1 ('''B''') in a way that makes it less consistent with viewing through an imperfect medium should decrease, or reverse, the illusion. Trials confirm this hypothesis. This explanation throws into doubt the hypothesis that implies that altering luminance, [[motion (physics)|motion]], or spectral distribution of the field surrounding the target would not alter perception.&lt;ref name="swerve"/&gt;

The empirical findings also contradict the hypothesis that 'illusions of brightness' caused by [[contour junctions]] in the stimulus explain the Chubb illusion, as proposed by Anderson (1997).&lt;ref name="swerve"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=B.L. |title=A theory of illusory lightness and transparency in monocular and binocular images: the role of contour junctions. |journal=Perception |year=1997 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=419–453 |url=http://web.mit.edu/persci/people/bart/Perception_Neon.pdf |doi=10.1068/p260419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chubb illusions in predicting schizophrenia ==
Visual illusions can be categorised into physiological/pathological, perceptual and ambiguous (bistable/multistable). A deviation from the natural perception of objects (stimulus) encourages evaluation of the theories of perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-0213-7_10|title=Computational and Cognitive Neuroscience of Vision|last=Soon|first=Chun Siong|last2=Dubey|first2=Rachit|last3=Ananyev|first3=Egor|last4=Hsieh|first4=Po-Jang|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Springer Singapore|isbn=9789811002113|editor-last=Zhao|editor-first=Qi|series=Cognitive Science and Technology|pages=221–233|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-981-10-0213-7_10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visual perception in [[schizophrenia]] is distinguished by reduced contextual adjustments and a more accurate perception of the stimulus in tasks involving ‘spatial contextual effects’.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Eunice|last2=Tadin|first2=Duje|last3=Glasser|first3=Davis M.|last4=Hong|first4=Sang Wook|last5=Blake|first5=Randolph|last6=Park|first6=Sohee|date=2012-11-15|title=Visual Context Processing in Schizophrenia|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2167702612464618|journal=Clinical Psychological Science|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=5–15|doi=10.1177/2167702612464618|pmc=3756604|pmid=23997995}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eunice et al., “contextual illusions arise from vision’s adaptive propensity to emphasize relative differences among features rather than their absolute characteristics.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the presence of a high-contrast background reduces the apparent contrast of smaller foreground features in healthy individuals, schizophrenic patients are more accurate in perceiving the contrast between the background and foreground. In order to test this, Keane et al. measured the performance of 15 participants with chronic schizophrenia, 13 psychiatric participants- including individuals with personality and bipolar disorders and 20 non-psychiatric healthy individuals. They were presented with a small isolated target patch or a small patch with a high contrast background, followed by a remote reference patch. The individuals were then asked to note which patch they thought was higher in contrast based on their observations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dakin|first=Steven|last2=Carlin|first2=Patricia|last3=Hemsley|first3=David|date=2005-10-25|title=Weak suppression of visual context in chronic schizophrenia|journal=Current Biology|volume=15|issue=20|pages=R822–824|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.10.015|issn=0960-9822|pmid=16243017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The schizophrenic group’s immunity to contrast illusion was exceptional, with 12 out of 15 accurate judgements while healthy participants showed severe misperceptions of the centre stimuli. This shows that individuals with schizophrenia are able to perceive ‘absolute characteristics’ of ‘individual features’ more accurately.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  While contextual modulations with regard to luminance, size and orientation were similar between groups, weak contextual modulations correlate with worse symptoms and social functioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keane|first=Brian P.|last2=Joseph|first2=Jamie|last3=Silverstein|first3=Steven M.|date=2014-04-01|title=Late, not early, stages of Kanizsa shape perception are compromised in schizophrenia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393214000426|journal=Neuropsychologia|volume=56|pages=302–311|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.02.001|pmc=4103877|pmid=24513023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Visual defects in schizophrenia can lead to cognitive and social problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Findings of enhanced performance help us ascertain the latent visual abnormalities. Indeed, there has been a rapid growth in the use of contextual visual tasks (Chubb illusions) in clinical testing and NIH-supported studies of schizophrenia. (Gold et al., 2012).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Old age ==
There is a reduction of the cortical inhibitory function within the ageing visual system, both in humans and animals. This reduction in inhibition accounts for a reduced orientation and direction tuning of aged visual neurons. L.R. Betts et al. (2005) demonstrated that older people were able to distinguish the motion of high-contrast stimuli quicker younger adults and that inhibition was responsible for differences in spatial suppression.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karas|first=Renee|last2=McKendrick|first2=Allison M.|date=2009-05-14|title=Aging alters surround modulation of perceived contrast|journal=Journal of Vision|volume=9|issue=5|pages=11.1–9|doi=10.1167/9.5.11|issn=1534-7362|pmid=19757889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karas and McKendrick (2009) used the Chubb illusion to test whether high contrast backgrounds affected the visual perceptions of older participants lesser than the younger participants owing to reduced inhibition. The stimuli used for the experiments were based on the parameters used by Dakin, Carlin and Hemsley (2005), who used the Chubb illusion to check for reduced inhibition in schizophrenics. Their study however, showed that contrast sensitivity did not really decline with ageing as the older participants showed a greater discrepancy in perceived contrast of the target with regard to the background than the younger participants.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

An unknown number of men were sterilised abroad or illegally in Sweden. This may have been the cause of the lower number of operations during the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When, from January 1976, permission was no longer needed, the number of sterilisations grew considerably.]]
'''Compulsory sterilisation in Sweden''' were [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilisation]]s which were carried out in Sweden, without a valid consent of the subject, during the years 1906–1975 on eugenic, medical and social grounds. Between 1972 and 2012, sterilisation was also a condition for [[sex change]].

== Legal grounds ==
The general rule between 1941 and 1976 was that sterilisation was illegal, but there were three grounds on which sterilisation could be permitted:&lt;ref&gt;SOU 1974:25 ''[[:Commons:SOU 1974 25 Fri sterilisering.djvu|Fri sterilisering]]'', &lt;small&gt;"The current Sterilization Law (1941: 282) is restrictive. License is required for sterilization and permission is granted only if certain restricted conditions of an eugenic, social or medical nature are fulfilled."&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* Medical, if a pregnancy could seriously put a woman suffering from chronic illness or permanently weakened constitution at risk of life and health.
* [[Eugenics|Eugenic]], which allowed sterilising people considered insane or with severe illness or with a physical disability.
* Social indication allowed sterilisation of people considered unsuitable to foster a child due to [[mental illness]], being [[feebleminded]] or having an [[antisocial lifestyle]].

It was never legal to physically restrain a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| quote                 = The Swedish laws never allowed the use of physical force. Furthermore the great majority of sterilisations were made following a personal application. Nevertheless many sterilisations took place in a context of compulsion or coercion, as it would be defined today.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1944, the number of [[eugenics|eugenic]] sterilisations under the 1941 legal provisions gradually decreased.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Statistics==

The number of eugenic sterilisations peaked in the 1940s; from 1944, the number of sterilisations under the 1941 legal provisions gradually decreased.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In 1997, on behalf of the Swedish government, the ethnologists Mikael Eivergård and Lars-Eric Jönsson made an attempt at estimating what percentage of sterilisations were coerced. They found that a quarter of the applications were made under circumstances similar to coercion such as a condition for release from an institution and that another 9 percent were signed under pressure. In half of the cases they found no sign of coercion or pressure, but signs of the applicants own initiative. Tydén uses these percentages to make an estimate of the number of operations under coercion. He found that 15,000 were made as a condition for release and that another 5500 to 6000 were made under other kinds of pressure, whereas 30,000 were voluntary and on the applicants' own initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International| isbn = 978-91-22-01958-9| last = Tydén| first = Mattias| title = Från politik till praktik : de svenska steriliseringslagarna 1935-1975| location = Stockholm| series = Stockholm studies in history, 0491-0842 ; 63| date = 2002|pages = 69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sterilisation during sex change ==

Until 2012, sterilisation was mandatory before [[sex change]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/38466/20120112/ Sweden keeps sex-change sterilisation law], [[The Local]], January 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This last mandatory sterilisation has been criticised by several political parties in Sweden and since 2011 the [[Parliament of Sweden]] was expected to change the law but ran into opposition from the Christian Democrat party. After efforts to overturn the law failed in parliament, the Stockholm Administrative Court of Appeal overturned the law on 19 December 2012, declaring it unconstitutional&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/01/14/transgender-people-in-sweden-no-longer-face-forced-sterilisation/ | title=Transgender People in Sweden No Longer Face Forced Sterilisation | last=Nelson | first=Rebecca | newspaper=Time | issn=0040-781X | access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/14/sweden-transgender-sterilisation-law-overturned_n_2472925.html | title=Good News For Sweden's Transgender Residents | date=2013-01-14 | website=The Huffington Post | access-date=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the law was challenged by an unidentified plaintiff.

It is currently observed in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[India]] and [[Member states of the Council of Europe|47 European countries]].

Data Privacy Day's educational initiative originally focused on [[consciousness raising|raising awareness]] among businesses as well as users about the importance of protecting the privacy of their personal information online, particularly in the context of [[social networking]].  The educational focus has expanded over the past four years to include families, consumers and businesses.  In addition to its educational initiative, Data Privacy Day promotes events and activities that stimulate the development of technology tools that promote individual control over [[personally identifiable information]]; encourage compliance with [[privacy laws]] and regulations; and create dialogues among stakeholders interested in advancing data protection and privacy.  The international celebration offers many opportunities for collaboration among governments, industry, academia, nonprofits, privacy professionals and educators.

The [[Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data]] was opened for signature by the [[Council of Europe]] on January 28, 1981. This convention is currently in the process of being updated in order to reflect new legal challenges caused by technological development. The [[Convention on Cybercrime]] is also protecting the integrity of data systems and thus of privacy in cyberspace. Privacy including data protection is also protected by [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]].

The day was initiated by the [[Council of Europe]] to be first held in 2007 as the European Data Protection Day.
Two years later, on January 26, 2009, the United States [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] passed House Resolution HR 31 by a vote of 402–0, declaring January 28 National Data Privacy Day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.res.00031/ H.Res.31 Expressing support for the designation of January 28, 2009 as "National Data Privacy Day"]&lt;/ref&gt; On January 28, 2009, the Senate passed Senate Resolution 25 also recognizing January 28, 2009 as National Data Privacy Day. The [[United States Senate]] also recognized Data Privacy Day in 2010 and 2011.

In response to the increasing levels of data breaches and the global importance of privacy and data security, in 2009 the Online Trust Alliance (OTA) and dozens of global organizations embraced Data Privacy Day as '''Data Privacy &amp; Protection Day''', emphasizing the need to look at the long-term impact to consumers of data collection, use and protection practices. Other organizations including the [[National Cyber Security Alliance]] work to coordinate Data Privacy Day activities in the U.S.[4]

==Participating organizations==
A few of the participating organizations for the January 28, 2016 Data Privacy and Protection day include; Anti-Phishing Working Group, California Office of Privacy Protection, [[Carnegie Mellon University]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://cups.cs.cmu.edu/privacy-day/ CMU Privacy Day website]&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber Data-Risk Managers, EDUCAUSE, [[Georgetown University]], [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), [[Federal Communication Commission]] (FCC), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), Identity Theft Council, the [[Privacy Commissioner of Canada]], New York State Attorney General Office, [https://otalliance.org Online Trust Alliance (OTA)]&lt;ref&gt;https://otalliance.org/initiatives/data-privacy-protection-day &lt;/ref&gt;, the UK Information Commissioner.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.staysafeonline.org/dpd/2012-events Data Privacy Day 2012 website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanprivacyday.org/eventsbydate European Privacy Day 2012 website]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Data Security Council of India]].

Corporate supporters of the 2015 Data Privacy &amp; Protection Day include Act-On, ATT, the Brunswick Group, Bryan Cave, Epsilon, Health Alliance Plan, Henry Ford Health System, Hogan Lovells, Holland &amp; Knight, IdentityGuard, Intersections, Intel, Microsoft, Morrison &amp; Foerster, Mozilla, Symantec, Sailthru, Verizon, VeriSign, TRUSTe and others.

It is notable for being one of the earliest examples of an [[open gaming]] licence, predating the better known [[Open Game License]].&lt;ref&gt;John Munsch, "Making Sure An Open Source RPG Stays Available": {{cite web |url=http://www.johnmunsch.com/2006/09/making_sure_a_open_source_rpg.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625084400/http://www.johnmunsch.com/2006/09/making_sure_a_open_source_rpg.html |archivedate=2008-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal provisions ==
The main rights granted by the DRL are (1) the right to distribute Dominion Rules, (2) the right to modify Dominion Rules, (3) the rights to create and distribute "Larger Works" and "Compatible Works".

The main right licensees grant under the DRL is the right of others to copy, modify and distribute any modifications to Dominion Rules a licensee makes.

These provisions resemble those found in many [[Open-source license|open-source licences]].

== Versions ==
Version 1.1 of the DRL is the most prominent previous version. It was under this version of the DRL that [[Dominion Rules]] 2.0 was released in 2002.

The current version of the DRL is 2.0. It closely resembles version 1.1 but has been simplified in some respects. DRL v. 2.0 is the version under which [[Dominion Rules]] 3.0 was released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.dominionrules.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Environmental economics''' is a sub-field of [[economics]] that is concerned with environmental issues. It has become a widely studied topic due to growing concerns in regards to the environment in the twentyfirst century.

Environmental economics is distinguished from [[ecological economics]] in that ecological economics emphasizes the economy as a subsystem of the ecosystem with its focus upon preserving [[natural capital]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Environmental_and_ecological_economics Lead Author: Robert Nadeau Article Topics: Ecological economics and Environmental economics Last Updated: August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh (2001).

==Topics and concepts==
{{Economics sidebar}}

===Market failure===
Central to environmental economics is the concept of [[market failure]].  Market failure means that markets fail to allocate resources efficiently. As stated by Hanley, Shogren, and White (2007) in their textbook ''Environmental Economics'':&lt;ref&gt;Hanley, N., J. Shogren, and B. White (2007). Environmental Economics in Theory and Practice, Palgrave, London.&lt;/ref&gt; "A market failure occurs when the market does not allocate scarce resources to generate the greatest social welfare. A wedge exists between what a private person does given market prices and what society might want him or her to do to protect the environment.  Such a wedge implies wastefulness or economic inefficiency; resources can be reallocated to make at least one person better off without making anyone else worse off." Common forms of market failure include externalities, non-excludability and [[Rivalry (economics)|non-rivalry]].

===Externality===
An [[externality]] exists when a person makes a choice that affects other people in a way that is not accounted for in the market price. An externality can be positive or negative, but is usually associated with negative externalities in environmental economics. For instance, water seepage in residential buildings happen in upper floor affect the lower floor.&lt;ref&gt;Rita Yi Man Li (2012), The Internalisation Of Environmental Externalities Affecting Dwellings: A Review Of Court Cases In Hong Kong, Economic Affairs, Volume 32, Issue 2, pages 81–87&lt;/ref&gt; Another example concerns how the sale of Amazon timber disregards the amount of carbon dioxide released in the cutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Environmental degradation replaces classic imperialism|last=Chapman|first=Same|date=May 3, 2012|work=The Whitman College Pioneer: Whitman College|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2018}} Or a firm emitting [[pollution]] will typically not take into account the costs that its pollution imposes on others.  As a result, pollution may occur in excess of the 'socially efficient' level, which is the level that would exist if the market was required to account for the pollution. A classic definition influenced by [[Kenneth Arrow]] and [[James Meade]] is provided by Heller and Starrett (1976), who define an externality as "a situation in which the private economy lacks sufficient incentives to create a potential market in some good and the nonexistence of this market results in losses of [[Pareto efficiency]]".&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Walter P. and David A. Starrett (1976), On the Nature of Externalities, in: Lin, Stephen A.Y. (ed.), Theory and Measurement of Economic Externalities, Academic Press, New York, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;  In economic terminology, externalities are examples of [[market failure]]s, in which the unfettered market does not lead to an efficient outcome.

===Common goods and public goods===
When it is too costly to exclude some people from access to an environmental resource, the resource is either called a [[common-pool resource|common property resource]] (when there is rivalry for the resource, such that one person's use of the resource reduces others' opportunity to use the resource) or a [[public good]] (when use of the resource is [[rivalry (economics)|non-rivalrous]]). In either case of non-exclusion, market allocation is likely to be inefficient.

These challenges have long been recognized. [[Garrett Hardin|Hardin]]'s (1968) concept of the [[tragedy of the commons]] popularized the challenges involved in non-exclusion and common property. "Commons" refers to the environmental asset itself, "common property resource" or "common pool resource" refers to a property right regime that allows for some collective body to devise schemes to exclude others, thereby allowing the capture of future benefit streams; and "open-access" implies no ownership in the sense that property everyone owns nobody owns.&lt;ref name="Ostrom, E 1990"&gt;Ostrom, E. 1990. Governing the Commons. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic problem is that if people ignore the scarcity value of the commons, they can end up expending too much effort, [[over harvesting]] a resource (e.g., a fishery). Hardin theorizes that in the absence of restrictions, users of an open-access resource will use it more than if they had to pay for it and had exclusive rights, leading to [[environmental degradation]].  See, however, [[Elinor Ostrom|Ostrom]]'s (1990) work on how people using real common property resources have worked to establish self-governing rules to reduce the risk of the tragedy of the commons.&lt;ref name="Ostrom, E 1990"/&gt;

The [[mitigation of climate change]] effects is an example of a public good, where the social benefits are not reflected completely in the market price. This is a public good since the risks of climate change are both non-rival and non-excludable.  Such efforts are non-rival since climate mitigation provided to one does not reduce the level of mitigation that anyone else enjoys.  They are non-excludable actions as they will have global consequences from which no one can be excluded. A country's incentive to invest in carbon abatement is reduced because it can "[[Free rider problem|free ride]]" off the efforts of other countries. Over a century ago, Swedish economist [[Knut Wicksell]] (1896) first discussed how public goods can be under-provided by the market because people might conceal their preferences for the good, but still enjoy the benefits without paying for them.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Valuation ===
Assessing the economic value of the environment is a major topic within the field. Use and indirect use are tangible benefits accruing from [[natural resource]]s or [[ecosystem services]] (see the [[Ecological economics#Nature|nature section]] of ecological economics). Non-use values include existence, option, and bequest values. For example, some people may value the existence of a diverse set of species, regardless of the effect of the loss of a species on ecosystem services. The existence of these species may have an option value, as there may be the possibility of using it for some human purpose. For example, certain plants may be researched for drugs. Individuals may value the ability to leave a pristine environment to their children.

Use and indirect use values can often be inferred from revealed behavior, such as the cost of taking [[travel cost analysis|recreational trips]] or using [[hedonic model|hedonic methods]] in which values are estimated based on observed prices.  Non-use values are usually estimated using stated preference methods such as [[contingent valuation]] or [[choice modelling]]. Contingent valuation typically takes the form of surveys in which people are asked how much they would pay to observe and recreate in the environment ([[willingness to pay]]) or their willingness to accept (WTA) compensation for the destruction of the environmental good. [[Hedonic pricing]] examines the effect the environment has on economic decisions through housing prices, traveling expenses, and payments to visit parks.&lt;ref&gt;Harris J. (2006). ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solutions==
Solutions advocated to correct such externalities include:

* '' [[United States Environmental Protection Agency#Related legislation|Environmental regulations]]''. Under this plan, the economic impact has to be estimated by the regulator. Usually this is done using [[cost-benefit analysis]].  There is a growing realization that regulations (also known as "command and control" instruments) are not so distinct from economic instruments as is commonly asserted by proponents of environmental economics.  E.g.1 regulations are enforced by fines, which operate as a form of tax if pollution rises above the threshold prescribed.  E.g.2 pollution must be monitored and laws enforced, whether under a pollution tax regime or a regulatory regime.  The main difference an environmental economist would argue exists between the two methods, however, is the total cost of the regulation.  "Command and control" regulation often applies uniform emissions limits on polluters, even though each firm has different costs for emissions reductions.  Some firms, in this system, can abate inexpensively, while others can only abate at high cost.  Because of this, the total abatement has some expensive and some inexpensive efforts to abate.  Consequently, modern "Command and control" regulations are oftentimes designed in a way, which addresses these issues by incorporating utility parameters. For instance, CO2 emission standards for specific manufacturers in the automotive industry are either linked to the average vehicle footprint (US system) or average vehicle weight (EU system) of their entire vehicle fleet. Environmental economic regulations find the cheapest emission abatement efforts first, then the more expensive methods second.  E.g. as said earlier, trading, in the quota system, means a firm only abates if doing so would cost less than paying someone else to make the same reduction.  This leads to a lower cost for the total abatement effort as a whole.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
* ''[[quota on pollution|Quotas on pollution]]''. Often it is advocated that pollution reductions should be achieved by way of [[tradeable emissions permits]], which if freely traded may ensure that reductions in pollution are achieved at least cost. In theory, if such tradeable quotas are allowed, then a firm would reduce its own pollution load only if doing so would cost less than paying someone else to make the same reduction.  In practice, tradeable permits approaches have had some success, such as the U.S.'s sulphur dioxide trading program or the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, and interest in its application is spreading to other environmental problems.
* ''[[Tax, tariff and trade|Taxes and tariffs on pollution]]''. Increasing the costs of polluting will discourage polluting, and will provide a "dynamic incentive," that is, the disincentive continues to operate even as pollution levels fall.  A pollution tax that reduces pollution to the socially "optimal" level would be set at such a level that pollution occurs only if the benefits to society (for example, in form of greater production) exceeds the costs. Some advocate a major shift from taxation from income and sales taxes to tax on pollution - the so-called "[[green tax shift]]."
* ''Better defined [[property rights]]''. The [[Coase Theorem]] states that assigning property rights will lead to an optimal solution, regardless of who receives them, if [[transaction costs]] are trivial and the number of parties negotiating is limited. For example, if people living near a factory had a right to clean air and water, or the factory had the right to pollute, then either the factory could pay those affected by the pollution or the people could pay the factory not to pollute. Or, citizens could take action themselves as they would if other property rights were violated. The US River Keepers Law of the 1880s was an early example, giving citizens downstream the right to end pollution upstream themselves if government itself did not act (an early example of [[bioregional democracy]]).  Many markets for "pollution rights" have been created in the late twentieth century—see [[emissions trading]]. According to the Coase Theorem, the involved parties will bargain with each other, which results in an efficient solution. However, modern economic theory has shown that the presence of asymmetric information may lead to inefficient bargaining outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myerson|first=Roger B|last2=Satterthwaite|first2=Mark A|date=1983|title=Efficient mechanisms for bilateral trading|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0531(83)90048-0|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=29|issue=2|pages=265–281|doi=10.1016/0022-0531(83)90048-0|issn=0022-0531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Rob (1989) has shown that pollution claim settlements will not lead to the socially optimal outcome when the individuals that will be affected by pollution have learned private information about their disutility already before the negotiations take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rob|first=Rafael|date=1989|title=Pollution claim settlements under private information|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0531(89)90022-7|journal=Journal of Economic Theory|volume=47|issue=2|pages=307–333|doi=10.1016/0022-0531(89)90022-7|issn=0022-0531|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldlücke and Schmitz (2018) have shown that inefficiencies may also result if the parties learn their private information only after the negotiations, provided that the feasible transfer payments are bounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldlücke|first=Susanne|last2=Schmitz|first2=Patrick W.|date=2018|title=Pollution claim settlements reconsidered: Hidden information and bounded payments|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.08.005|journal=European Economic Review|volume=110|pages=211–222|doi=10.1016/j.euroecorev.2018.08.005|issn=0014-2921|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to other fields ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}
Environmental economics is related to [[ecological economics]] but there are differences. Most environmental economists have been trained as economists. They apply the tools of economics to address environmental problems, many of which are related to so-called market failures—circumstances wherein the "[[invisible hand]]" of economics is unreliable.  Most ecological economists have been trained as ecologists, but have expanded the scope of their work to consider the impacts of humans and their economic activity on ecological systems and services, and vice versa. This field takes as its premise that economics is a strict subfield of [[ecology]].  Ecological economics is sometimes described as taking a more pluralistic approach to [[natural environment|environmental]] problems and focuses more explicitly on long-term environmental sustainability and issues of scale.

Environmental economics is viewed as more pragmatic in a [[price system]]; ecological economics as more idealistic in its attempts not to use [[money]] as a primary arbiter of decisions. These two groups of specialists sometimes have conflicting views which may be traced to the different philosophical underpinnings.

Another context in which [[Externality|externalities]] apply is when [[globalization]] permits one player in a market who is unconcerned with [[biodiversity]] to undercut prices of another who is - creating a [[race to the bottom]] in regulations and conservation. This, in turn, may cause loss of [[natural capital]] with consequent erosion, water purity problems, diseases, desertification, and other outcomes which are not [[Pareto efficiency|efficient]] in an economic sense. This concern is related to the subfield of [[sustainable development]] and its political relation, the [[anti-globalization movement]].

Environmental economics was once distinct from [[resource economics]]. Natural resource economics as a subfield began when the main concern of researchers was the optimal commercial exploitation of natural resource stocks. But resource managers and policy-makers eventually began to pay attention to the broader importance of natural resources (e.g. values of fish and trees beyond just their commercial exploitation). It is now difficult to distinguish "environmental" and "natural resource" economics as separate fields as the two became associated with [[sustainability]].  Many of the more radical [[green economists]] split off to work on an alternate [[political economy]].

Environmental economics was a major influence on the theories of [[natural capitalism]] and [[environmental finance]], which could be said to be two sub-branches of environmental economics concerned with resource conservation in production, and the [[value of biodiversity]] to humans, respectively.  The theory of [[natural capitalism]] (Hawken, Lovins, Lovins) goes further than traditional environmental economics by envisioning a world where natural services are considered on par with [[Capital (economics)|physical capital]].

The more radical [[Green economists]] reject neoclassical economics in favour of a new [[political economy]] beyond [[capitalism]] or [[communism]] that gives a greater emphasis to the interaction of the human economy and the natural environment, acknowledging that "economy is three-fifths of ecology" - Mike Nickerson.

These more radical approaches would imply changes to [[money supply]] and likely also a [[bioregional democracy]] so that political, economic, and ecological "environmental limits" were all aligned, and not subject to the [[arbitrage]] normally possible under [[capitalism]].

An emerging sub-field of environmental economics studies its intersection with [[development economics]]. Dubbed "envirodevonomics" by [[Michael Greenstone]] and B. Kelsey Jack in their paper "Envirodevonomics: A Research Agenda for a Young Field," the sub-field is primarily interested in studying "why environmental quality [is] so poor in developing countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Greenstone |first1=Michael |last2=Jack |first2=B. Kelsey |title=Envirodevonomics: A Research Agenda for an Emerging Field |journal=Journal of Economic Literature |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=5–42 |doi=10.1257/jel.53.1.5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A strategy for better understanding this correlation between a country's GDP and its environmental quality involves analyzing how many of the central concepts of environmental economics, including market failures, externalities, and willingness to pay, may be complicated by the particular problems facing developing countries, such as political issues, lack of infrastructure, or inadequate financing tools, among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Inclusive green growth the pathway to sustainable development.|date=May 2012|publisher=World Bank|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-9552-3|pages=12–13|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTSDNET/Resources/Inclusive_Green_Growth_May_2012.pdf|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''eternal feminine''' is a psychological [[archetype]] or philosophical principle that idealizes an immutable concept of "woman". It is one component of [[gender essentialism]], the belief that men and women have different core "essences" that cannot be altered by time or environment.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Abraham, "Justice as the Mark of Catholic Feminist Ecclesiology," in ''Frontiers in Catholic Feminist Theology: Shoulder to Shoulder'' (Fortress Press, 2009), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; The conceptual ideal was particularly vivid in the 19th century, when women were often depicted as angelic, responsible for drawing men upward on a moral and spiritual path.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Nesbitt Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender: Beyond Man And Woman'', pp. 6–7, 16–17, 22 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among those virtues variously regarded as essentially feminine are "modesty, gracefulness, purity, delicacy, civility, compliancy, reticence, chastity, affability, [and] politeness".&lt;ref&gt;Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar, ''The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination'' (Yale University Press, 2nd ed. 2000, originally published 1979), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the "eternal feminine" ({{lang-de|das Ewig-Weibliche}}) was particularly important to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], who introduces it at the end of ''[[Faust (Goethe)|Faust]]'', Part 2.&lt;ref&gt;Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender'', p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; For Goethe, "woman" symbolized pure contemplation, in contrast to masculine action, parallel to the eastern Daoist descriptions of Yin and Yang.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert and Gubar, ''The Madwoman in the Attic,'' p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The feminine principle is further articulated by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] within a continuity of life and death, based in large part on his readings of [[ancient Greek literature]], since in Greek culture both childbirth and the care of the dead were managed by women.&lt;ref&gt;Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[wikt:domesticity|Domesticity]], and the power to redeem and serve as moral guardian, were also components of the "eternal feminine".&lt;ref&gt;Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The virtues of women were inherently private, while those of men were public.&lt;ref&gt;Oppel, ''Nietzsche On Gender'', p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''full-body scanner''' is a device that detects objects on a person's body for security screening purposes, without physically removing clothes or making physical contact.  Depending on the technology used, the operator may see an alternate-wavelength image of the person's naked body, or merely a cartoon-like representation of the person with an indicator showing where any suspicious items were detected.  For privacy and security reasons, the display is generally not visible to other passengers, and in some cases is located in a separate room where the operator cannot see the face of the person being screened.  Unlike [[metal detector]]s, full-body scanners can detect non-metal objects, which became an increasing concern after various airliner bombing attempts in the 2000s.

Starting in 2007, full-body scanners started supplementing metal detectors at airports and train stations in many countries.

Three distinct technologies have been used, though the use of Backscatter X-ray has now been discontinued in many countries:
* [[Millimeter wave scanner]]s use non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation similar to that used by wireless data transmitters, in the [[Extremely high frequency|Extremely High Frequency (EHF)]] radio band (which is a lower frequency than visible light). The health risks posed by these machines are still being studied, and the evidence is mixed, though millimeter wave scanners do not generate [[ionizing radiation]]. &lt;ref name="health_privacy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://securitymanagement.com/news/companies-seek-full-body-scans-ease-health-privacy-concerns-006852 |work=Security Management |title=Companies Seek Full-Body Scans That Ease Health, Privacy Concerns |author=Harwood, Matthew |date=March 5, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006112416/http://securitymanagement.com/news/companies-seek-full-body-scans-ease-health-privacy-concerns-006852 |archivedate=October 6, 2014 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Backscatter X-ray]] machines use low dose penetrating radiation for detecting suspicious metallic and non-metallic objects hidden under clothing or in shoes and in the cavities of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='AMAZING RESULTS' OF THE SCANNER THAT 'SEES EVERYTHING' |url=http://www.domodedovo.ru/en/main/news/publ_press/?ID=1608 |work=Moscow Domodedovo Airport |date=October 2, 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303102333/http://www.domodedovo.ru/en/main/news/publ_press/?ID=1608 |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been considerable debate with regard to how safe this technology is.
* Through-body [[X-Ray]] security scanners that emit a high level of radiation have been supplied by the US to at least two African countries.
Passengers and advocates have objected to images of their naked bodies being displayed to screening agents or recorded by the government. Critics have called the imaging virtual strip searches without probable cause, and have suggested they are illegal and violate basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/10/AR2011031003628.html|title=Group says body scanners an 'unreasonable search'|author=Pickler, Nedra |publisher=The Washington Post|date=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current technology is less intrusive and because of [[privacy]] issues most people are allowed to refuse this scan and opt for a traditional pat-down.

==History (US)==
The first full body security scanner was developed by Dr. Steven W Smith,&lt;ref name="Tek84.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tek84.com/company.html |title=Steven W. Smith / Original Developer of Secure 1000 in 1992 |publisher=Tek84.com |date= |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908095734/http://www.tek84.com/company.html |archivedate=September 8, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, John (January 14, 2010) [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122499686 New Airport Body Scans Don't Detect All Weapons]. National Public Radio&lt;/ref&gt; who developed the Secure 1000 whole body scanner in 1992. He subsequently sold the device and associated patents to [[Rapiscan Systems]], who now manufacture and distribute the device.

The first passive, non-radiating full body screening device was developed by [[Lockheed Martin]] through a sponsorship by the National Institute of Justice ([[NIJ]])'s Office of Science and Technology and the [[United States Air Force Research Laboratory]]. Proof of concept was conducted in 1995 through the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]). Rights to this technology were subsequently acquired by [[Brijot|Brijot Imaging Systems]], who further matured a commercial-grade product line and now manufacture, market and support the passive millimeter wave devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Brijot Acquires Rights to Lockheed Martin-Developed Technology for Design and Development of Concealed Weapons Detection Camera, Supporting Counter-Terrorism and Homeland Security Efforts |work=Business Wire |url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-90526909.html | location=Orlando | date=August 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Safety aspects of the Secure 1000 have been investigated in the US by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] and [[National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements]] since the early 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

[[File:AIT Passenger Checkpoint Video.ogv|thumb|Video from the TSA explaining the procedure]]
[[Schiphol]] in the [[Netherlands]] was the first [[airport]] in the world to implement this device on a large scale after a test with flight personnel the previous year. On May 15, 2007 two of 17 purchased security scans were installed. 

Full-body scanners was installed in at least one Florida courthouse in 2010&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/08/05/feds_pervscan/ Feds admit storing pervscanner pics], The Register, August 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and have started to appear in courthouses around the US.&lt;ref&gt;Banda, P.

''Associated Press'' via news.yahoo.com&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one New Jersey [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] train station used full-body scanners during a two-week trial in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hudsoncity.net/tubes/securitytesting.html PATH train riders to face anti-terror screening: PATH Trains Hudson Tubes Hudson &amp; Manhattan RR].

As of September 3, 2014, [[Transportation Security Administration]] reported that there were almost 740 Millimeter Wave AIT (Advanced Imaging Technology) &lt;sup&gt;[meaning needed]&lt;/sup&gt; scanners now in use at 160 United States airports &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140903061725/http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/advanced-imaging-technology-ait Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT)]. tsa.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Government also hinted in 2010 at the possibility of deploying the full body scanners at train stations and subways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/now-body-scanners-could-be-deployed-at-us-train-stations-subways-other-mass-transits-news-international-kl0rkpdbgja.html|title='Now 'body scanners' could be deployed at US train stations, subways, other mass transits'|publisher=sify|date=November 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian government had planned to install full-body scanners at all airport and train stations throughout the country, but announced in September 2010 plans to remove the scanners from airports, calling them "slow and ineffective."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/italy-to-abandon-airport-body-scanners-20100924-15pgu.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Italy to abandon airport body scanners | date=September 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has stated in 2010 they "[have] not, will not and the machines cannot store images of passengers at airports".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.tsa.gov/2010/08/tsa-response-to-feds-admit-storing.html |title=The TSA Blog: TSA Response to “Feds admit storing checkpoint body scan images” |publisher=Blog.tsa.gov |date=August 6, 2010 |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the TSA later disclosed, in a response to the house chair on homeland security, that its procurement of airport scanners requires manufacturers to include image storage and transmission features but that these features should be disabled before being placed in an airport. The TSA shows 45 individuals have the ability to turn these machines into 'test mode' which enables recording images, but states that they would never do this on a production system.&lt;ref&gt;Rossides, Gale D. (February 24, 2010) [https://epic.org/privacy/airtravel/backscatter/TSA_Reply_House.pdf Letter to Bennie G. Thompson]. &lt;/ref&gt; The US Marshal Service did operate a backscatter machine in a courthouse which records images. However, in a statement they noted that only individuals involved in a test were recorded. A sample of these images was received and disseminated by Gizmodo in 2010, using a Freedom Of Information Request.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40218074/ns/technology_and_science-security|title=Leaked U.S. Marshal body scan images revealed|author=Rothman, Wilson |publisher=MSN|date=November 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear if the US Marshal service has put these new scanning machines, that have recording capabilities, into production.

The analyst is in a different room and is not supposed to be able to see the person being scanned by the Backscatter X-Ray AIT, but is in contact with other officials who can halt the scanned person if anything suspicious shows up on the scan.

In the U.S. TSA currently uses Millimeter Wave AIT scanners exclusively, which show no identifying characteristics of the person being scanned. Instead, a generic outline of a person is used.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150503061337/http://www.tsa.gov/ait-how-it-works AIT: How it Works]. U.S. Transportation Security Administration &lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2015, "While passengers may generally decline AIT screening in favor of physical screening, TSA may direct mandatory AIT screening for some passengers as warranted by security considerations in order to safeguard transportation security."&lt;ref name=Vaughan&gt;Vaughan, Jill (December 18, 2015) [https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-tsa-pia-32-d-ait.pdf Privacy Impact Assessment: Update for TSA Advanced Imaging Technology]. U.S. Department of Homeland Security&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]] currently allows member states to decide whether to implement full body scanners in their countries:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/aviation-security.56u/ Member States must decide on airport body scanners: EC – EU business news].

In Australia the Government has decided a no opt-out policy will be enforced in relation to screening at airports. Persons with medical or physical conditions that prevent them from undertaking a body scan will be offered alternative screening methods suitable to their circumstances. Infants and young children under 140&amp;nbsp;cm will not be selected to undergo a body scan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160709151224/http://travelsecure.infrastructure.gov.au/bodyscanners/faq.aspx Airport Body Scanners—Frequently Asked Questions].

==Controversies==
{{criticism section|date=February 2015}}

The implementation of widespread full-body scanners has raised a public controversy.

===Privacy===
Some argue that the use of full-body scanners is equivalent to a strip search, and that if used without probable cause this violate basic human rights.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/aclu-backgrounder-body-scanners-and-virtual-strip-searches "ACLU Backgrounder on Body Scanners and 'Virtual Strip Searches'"], American Civil Liberties Union.

===Health concerns===
There have been health concerns relating to the use of full body scanning technology, especially the use of x-ray scanners.

====Millimeter wave scanners====
{{Main article|Millimeter wave scanner}}
Currently adopted millimeter wave scanners operate in the millimeter or sub-terahertz band, using [[non-ionizing radiation]], and have no proven adverse health effects, though no long term studies have been done.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com" /&gt; Thomas S. Tenforde, president of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, said in 2010 that millimeter wave scanners are probably within bounds [of standards for safe operation], but there should be an effort to verify that they are safe for frequent use.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes |first=John C. |url=http://www.diagnosticimaging.com/safety/content/article/113619/1509059 |title=Whole-body airport scanners are basically safe—or are they? |publisher=Diagnosticimaging.com |date=January 8, 2010 |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHO (World Health Organization) in 2011 categorized RF (radio frequency) radiation as a possible carcinogen,&lt;ref name=Wall Street Journal,10-3-14.

Numerical simulations of [[terahertz radiation]], which active millimeter wave scanners do not operate at, have produced mixed results. Researchers at the Center for Nonlinear Studies at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in New Mexico have used simulations to show a way that terahertz radiation may affect DNA
,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alexandrov|first1=B.S.|title= DNA Breathing Dynamics in the Presence of a Terahertz Field|journal=Physics Letters A|date=October 29, 2009|volume=374|issue=10|pages=1214|doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2009.12.077|pmid=20174451|pmc=2822276|arxiv=0910.5294 |bibcode=2010PhLA..374.1214A}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this has not been verified.

====Backscatter X-ray scanners====
In the United States, the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 required that all full-body scanners operated in airports by the [[Transportation Security Administration]] use "Automated Target Recognition" software, which replaces the picture of a nude body with the cartoon-like representation.&lt;ref name="abandons"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/01/tsa-abandons-nude-scanners/|title=TSA Pulls Plug on Airport Nude Body Scanners |date= 2013-01-18| first=David | last=Kravets}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this law, all backscatter X-ray machines formerly in use by the Transportation Security Administration were removed from airports by May 2013, since the agency said the vendor (Rapiscan) did not meet their contractual deadline to implement the software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Rapiscan backscatter contract | date=Jan 2013 | publisher=TSA | format= [[World wide Web]] log | url= http://blog.tsa.gov/2013/01/rapiscan-backscatter-contract.html}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The health effects of the more common millimeter wave scanner are largely unknown, and at least one expert believes a safety study is warranted. "I am very interested in performing a National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements study on the use of millimeter-wave security screening systems," said Thomas S. Tenforde, council president. However, no long-term studies have been done on the health effects of millimeter wave scanners.

Perhaps the most notable and debated professional opinion in regard to the safety of scanners is the so-called "Holdren Letter" from a number of world-renowned biochemists and biophysics researchers from the University of California to the Assistant to the US President for Science and Technology, Dr. John P. Holdren (Co-author of EcoSolutions). The opening paragraph of their letter of concern reads: "We, a number of University of California, San Francisco faculty, are writing—see attached memo—to call your attention to our concerns about the potential serious health risks of the recently adopted whole body back scatter X-ray airport security scanners. This is an urgent situation as these X-ray scanners are rapidly being implemented as a primary screening step for all air travel passengers."&lt;ref&gt;[https://shadowproof.com/letter-from-john-w-sedat-et-al-on-the-dangers-of-tsa-backscatter-scanners/ Letter from John W.

Critics of backscatter x-ray scanners, including the head of the [[Center for Radiological Research]] at [[Columbia University]], say that the radiation emitted by some full-body scanners is as much as 20 times stronger than officially reported and is not safe to use on large numbers of persons because of an increased risk of cancer to children and at-risk populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/7862265/Airport-body-scanners-could-give-you-cancer.html|title=Airport body scanners 'could give you cancer'|author=Bloxham, Andy |publisher=The Telegraph|location=London|date=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/health/Some |title=Some full-body scanners not without cancer risk: Experts |publisher=Canwest News Service |author=Tam, Pauline |date=January 22, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115144315/http://www.canada.com/health/Some+full+body+scanners+without+cancer+risk+Experts/2472370/story.html |archivedate=November 15, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/292414|date=May 23, 2010 |title=Radiation from airport scanners may increase cancer risk|author=Lindner, Bill |publisher=Digital Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Researchers at the [[University of California, San Francisco]], (UCSF) have argued that the amount of radiation is higher than claimed by the TSA and body scanner manufacturers because the doses were calculated as if distributed throughout the whole body, but the radiation from backscatter x-ray scanners is focused on just the skin and surrounding tissues:&lt;ref name="scribd.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, Scott. (May 18, 2010) [http://www.gadling.com/2010/05/18/scientists-question-safety-of-airport-full-body-scanners/ Scientists question safety of airport full body scanners]. Gadling.com. Retrieved on 2010-09-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiology.ucsf.edu/patient-care/patient-safety/radiation The risk of 'low dose radiation is controversial']. Radiology.ucsf.edu (February 14, 2010). Retrieved on 2011-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The majority of [the scanners'] energy is delivered to the skin and the underlying tissue. Thus, while the dose would be safe if it were distributed throughout the volume of the entire body, the dose to the skin may be dangerously high.

The X-ray dose from these devices has often been compared in the media to the cosmic ray exposure inherent to airplane travel or that of a chest X-ray. However, this comparison is very misleading: both the air travel cosmic ray exposure and chest X- rays have much higher X-ray energies and the health consequences are appropriately understood in terms of the whole body volume dose. In contrast, these new airport scanners are largely depositing their energy into the skin and immediately adjacent tissue, and since this is such a small fraction of body weight/vol, possibly by one to two orders of magnitude, the real dose to the skin is now high.

In addition, it appears that real independent safety data do not exist. A search, ultimately finding top FDA radiation physics staff, suggests that the relevant radiation quantity, the Flux [photons per unit area and time (because this is a scanning device)] has not been characterized. Instead an indirect test (Air Kerma) was made that emphasized the whole body exposure value, and thus it appears that the danger is low when compared to cosmic rays during airplane travel and a chest X-ray dose.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However other professors in the UCSF radiology department disagree, saying that the radiation dose is low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2010/11/tsa_scanner_controversy_ucsf_r.php|title=TSA Scanners: U.C.

"People who are totally unrelated to radiation wrote it. ... It was senior faculty at UCSF. They're smart people and well-intended, but their conclusions, I think, were off-base. They don't understand how radiation translates to an actual dose in the human body".

Dr. Steve Smith, inventor of the body scanner in 1991, and president of Tek84, one of the companies that produces the machines, has stated that the concerns of Dr. Brenner and UCSF Scientists regarding the skin dose of backscatter scanners are incorrect. He states the values used for X-ray penetration were incorrectly based on the description of the imaging depth which describes what the instrument sees and is a few mm into the skin and the dosage depth which is deeper. He describes experimental proof that the X-rays have the same properties as any other X-Rays and the penetration is correct to be averaged over the whole body. Dr. Smith has provided measured data from an operating body scanner to explain his position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tek84.com/downloads/Holt-Letter2010-12-2.pdf re: Misinformation on airport body scanner radiation safety] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716203604/http://www.tek84.com/downloads/Holt-Letter2010-12-2.pdf |date=July 16, 2011 }}.

Scanners also concentrate the dose in time, because they deliver a high dose-rate at the moment of exposure. High dose-rate exposure has been shown to cause greater damage than the same radiation dose delivered at lower rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0167-8140(86)80181-5|title=Dose-rate effects and the repair of radiation damage|year=1986|last1=Gordonsteel|first1=G|last2=Down|first2=J|last3=Peacock|first3=J|last4=Stephens|first4=T|journal=Radiotherapy and Oncology|volume=5|issue=4|pages=321–31|pmid=3726169}}&lt;/ref&gt; This raises further questions about comparisons to background radiation.

The FDA report states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since general-use x-ray systems emit ionizing radiation, the societal benefit of reliably detecting threats must be sufficient to outweigh the potential radiation risk, if any, to the individual screened. The dose from one screening with a general-use x-ray security screening system is so low that it presents an extremely small risk to any individual. To put the radiation dose received into perspective:
* Naturally occurring ionizing radiation is all around us. We are continuously exposed to this background radiation during ordinary living. In 42 minutes of ordinary living, a person receives more radiation from naturally occurring sources than from screening with any general-use x-ray security system.
* The national radiation safety standard (see below) sets a dose per screening limit for the general-use category. To meet the requirements of the general-use category a full-body x-ray security system must deliver less than the dose a person receives during 4 minutes of airline flight. TSA has set their dose limit to ensure a person receives less radiation from one scan with a TSA general-use x-ray security system than from 2 minutes of airline flight.

Dr. David Brenner, head of Columbia University's center for radiological research, said although the danger posed to the individual passenger is "very low", he is urging researchers to carry out more tests on the device to look at the way it affects specific groups who could be more sensitive to radiation. 

Dr. Andrew J. Einstein, director of cardiac CT research at Columbia University, has made the following statements in support of the safety of body scanners:&lt;ref name="businessweek.com" /&gt;: "A passenger would need to be scanned using a backscatter scanner, from both the front and the back, about 200,000 times to receive the amount of radiation equal to one typical CT scan," said Dr. Andrew J. Einstein, director of cardiac CT research at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. "Another way to look at this is that if you were scanned with a backscatter scanner every day of your life, you would still only receive a tenth of the dose of a typical CT scan," he said. "By comparison, the amount of radiation from a backscatter scanner is equivalent to about 10 minutes of natural background radiation in the United States", Einstein said. "I believe that the general public has nothing to worry about in terms of the radiation from airline scanning," he added. "For moms-to-be, no evidence supports an increased risk of miscarriage or fetal abnormalities from these scanners", Einstein added. "A pregnant woman will receive much more radiation from cosmic rays she is exposed to while flying than from passing through a scanner in the airport," he claimed.

In May 2010 the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements issued a press release in response to the health risk claims from UCSF and Columbia University (claims of excessive skin dose and risks to large populations vs. individuals). The NCRP claims that cancer risks cited by opponents are completely inaccurate, stating that:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncrponline.org/Press_Rel/Commentaries/Comm_16_Press_Release.pdf Structural Shielding Design and Evaluation for Megavoltage Radiotherapy Facilities].

&lt;blockquote&gt; the summation of trivial average risks over very large populations or time periods into a single value produces a distorted image of risk, completely out of perspective with risks accepted every day, both voluntarily and involuntarily.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and that

&lt;blockquote&gt;general-use systems should adhere to an effective dose of 0.1 microsievert (μSv) (0.01 millirem) or less per scan, and can be used mostly without regard to the number of individuals scanned or the number of scans per individual in a year. An effective dose of 0.1 μSv (0.01 mrem) per scan would allow 2,500 scans of an individual annually [i.e., if each scan required 0.1 μSv (0.01 mrem)] without exceeding the administrative control of 0.25 mSv (25 mrem) to a member of the general public for a single source or set of sources under one control. Assuming 250 workdays per year, this would correspond to an average of 10 scans each day, a frequency that is unlikely to be encountered.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All the same the [[Inter-Agency Committee on Radiation Safety]] which includes the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], [[Nuclear Energy Agency]] and the [[World Health Organization]], reported that, "Pregnant women and children should not be subject to scanning, even though the radiation dose from body scanners is 'extremely small'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aoG.YbbvnkzU&amp;pos=11|title=Airport Body Scanning Raises Radiation Exposure, Committee Says|author=Tirone, Jonathan |publisher=Bloomberg|date=February 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that defects in the machines, damage from normal wear-and-tear, or software errors could focus an intense dose of radiation on just one spot of the body. The researchers write:&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/35498347/UCSF-letter-to-Holdren-concerning-health-risks-of-full-body-scanner-TSA-screenings-4-6-2010 UCSF letter to Holdren concerning health risks of full body scanner TSA screenings 4-6-2010]. Scribd.com. Retrieved on September 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Moreover, there are a number of 'red flags' related to the hardware itself. Because this device can scan a human in a few seconds, the X-ray beam is very intense. Any glitch in power at any point in the hardware (or more importantly in software) that stops the device could cause an intense radiation dose to a single spot on the skin. Who will oversee problems with overall dose after repair or software problems? The TSA is already complaining about resolution limitations; who will keep the manufacturers and/or TSA from just raising the dose, an easy way to improve signal-to-noise and get higher resolution? Lastly, given the recent incident (on December 25th), how do we know whether the manufacturer or TSA, seeking higher resolution, will scan the groin area more slowly leading to a much higher total dose?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proponents of backscatter X-ray scanners argue that the [[ANSI N43.17 standard]] addresses safety requirements and engineering design of the systems to prevent the occurrence of accidental high radiation due to defects and errors in hardware and software. Safety requirements include "fail-safe" controls, multiple overlapping interlocks and engineering design to ensure that failure of any systems result in safe or non-operation of the system to reduce the chance of accidental exposures. Furthermore, TSA requires that certification to the ANSI N43.17 standard is performed by a third party and not by the manufacturer themselves.&lt;ref&gt;ANSI N43.17 (2009) section 7.2.1 and 7.2.2&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} But there are cases where types of medical scanning machines, operated by trained medical personnel, have malfunctioned, causing serious injury to patients that were scanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/01/health/01radiation.html|title=After Stroke Scans, Patients Face Serious Health Risks|author=Bogdanich, Walt |publisher=New York Times|date=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of full-body scanners cite these incidents as examples of how radiation-based scanning machines can overdose people with radiation despite all safety precautions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jay-stanley/full-body-scanners-from-a_b_694466.html Jay Stanley: Full Body Scanners: From Airports to the Streets?].

However, the European Commission's report provides no data substantiating the claim that "all other conditions are equal".

Forbes magazine reported, in March 2011, that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2011/03/02/docs-reveal-tsa-plan-to-body-scan-pedestrians-train-passengers|title=Documents Reveal TSA Research Proposal To Body-Scan Pedestrians, Train Passengers|author=Greenberg, Andy |date=March 2, 2011|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.forbes.com/andygreenberg/2011/03/09/tsa-never-tested-full-body-scans-for-mass-transit-except-when-it-did|title=TSA Never Tested Full-Body Scans For Mass Transit, Except When It Did|author=Greenberg, Andy |publisher=Forbes|date=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Newly uncovered documents show that as early as 2006, the Department of Homeland Security has been planning pilot programs to deploy mobile scanning units that can be set up at public events and in train stations, along with mobile x-ray vans capable of scanning pedestrians on city streets.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and that the TSA had research proposals to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;bring full-body scanners to train stations, mass transit, and public events. Contracts included in the EPIC release showed plans to develop long-range scans that could assess what a subject carried from 30 feet away, along with studies that involved systems for x-ray scanners mounted in vans and "covert" scans of pedestrians.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==="No nudity" full-body scanner===
The new software for scanners has been applied by US Aviation Security, so the new full-body scanner will not give image of nudity of the person who is scanned to the operators of the scanner, but only give the image as a generic male or female figure with no features. Opponents of full body scanners still consider this to be an unconstitutional strip search, because even though the operators see an edited version of the image, a naked image is still captured by the machine, and there is no guarantee that the Government or private companies won't store the images in the case that a terrorist attack were successful.

This type of software has been applied at Washington, Atlanta and Las Vegas airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Halsey |first=Ashley |url=http://seattletimes.com/html/travel/2015670654_nudescanners21.html |title=New airport software to end naked scanner images |publisher=Seattletimes.com |date= |accessdate=December 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Our top priority is the safety of the traveling public, and TSA constantly strives to explore and implement new technologies that enhance security and strengthen privacy protections for the traveling public," TSA Administrator John Pistole stated. "This software upgrade enables us to continue providing a high level of security through advanced imaging technology screening, while improving the passenger experience at checkpoints." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hachman|first=Mark|title=No more 'naked' full body airport scans after TSA upgrade|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2388855,00.asp|publisher=PCMAG|accessdate=April 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical countermeasures==
Some people wish to prevent either the loss of privacy or the possibility of health problems or genetic damage that might be associated with being subjected to a backscatter X-ray scan. One company sells X-ray absorbing underwear which is said to have X-ray absorption equivalent to 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm of lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rockyflatsgear.com/ |title=Rocky Flats Gear X-ray protection |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130901143535/http://www.rockyflatsgear.com/ |archivedate=September 1, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another product, Flying Pasties, is "...&amp;nbsp;designed to obscure the most private parts of the human body when entering full body airport scanners", but its description does not seem to claim any protection from the X-ray beam penetrating the body of the person being scanned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyingpasties.com/ |title=Flying Pasties |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601134012/http://flyingpasties.com/ |archivedate=June 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2998">'''Grounding''' is a common discipline technique used with children and teenagers, in which the child or teen is not allowed to leave their place of residence ''or'' [[bedroom]] except for required activities such as [[school]] or [[Employment|work]]. Children and teenagers are generally not allowed to leave the house for [[leisure]] during this time.

Other possible consequences can also include removing [[reinforcement#positive reinforcement|positive reinforcement]]s, privileges and [[freedom]] such as [[video game]]s, [[toy]]s, [[television]], [[computer]]s, [[mobile device]]s, [[Internet]], [[fidget spinner]]s, [[shopping mall]]s and hanging out with or having friends over.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

{{Christian mysticism}}
'''Henosis''' ({{lang-grc|[[wikt:ἕνωσις|ἕνωσις]]}}) is the classical Greek word for mystical "oneness", "union" or "unity." In [[Platonism]], and especially [[Neoplatonism]], the goal of henosis is union with what is fundamental in reality: the One ([[wikt:εἷς|Τὸ  Ἕν]]), the Source, or [[Monism|Monad]].{{sfn|Stamatellos|2007|p=37}} The Neoplatonic concept has precedents in the Greek [[mystery religions]]{{sfn|Angus|1975|p=52}} as well as parallels in [[Eastern philosophy]].{{sfn|Gregorios|2002}} It is further developed in the [[Corpus Hermeticum]], in [[Christian theology]], [[Alevism]], [[soteriology]] and [[mysticism]], and is an important factor in the historical development of [[monotheism]] during [[Late Antiquity]].

==Etymology==
The term is relatively common in classical texts, and has the meaning of "union" or "unity".{{refn|group=note|LSJ entry for enosis: ἕνωσις, -εως, ἡ, (from ἑνόω "Ι unite") A. combination into one, union, Philol.10, Archyt. ap.Stob.1.41.2, Arist.Ph.222a20, GC328b22, Phld.Po.2.17, Ph.1.45, al.; “τοῦ συμφραζομένου” A.D.Synt.175.16, cf. Hermog.Id.2.11: pl., Procl.Inst.63.

==Process of unification==
{{see also|Nepsis|Theoria}}

Henosis, or [[primordial unity]], is rational and deterministic, emanating from [[indeterminism]] an uncaused cause. Each individual as a [[Macrocosm and microcosm|microcosm]] reflects the gradual ordering of the universe referred to as the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]]. In mimicking the demiurge ([[Nous|divine mind]]), one unites with The One or Monad. Thus the process of unification, of "The Being" and "The One," is called henosis, the culmination of which is [[Apotheosis|deification]].{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==Plotinus==
{{Main|Plotinus}}

Henosis for Plotinus (204/5–270 CE) was defined in his works as a reversing of the ontological process of consciousness via [[meditation]] (in the Western mind to un[[Contemplation|contemplate]]) toward no thought ([[nous]] or [[demiurge]]) and no division ([[Dyad (symbol)|dyad]]) within the individual (being). As is specified in the writings of [[Plotinus]] on [[Henology]],{{refn|group=note|Plotinus:&lt;br&gt;* "Our thought cannot grasp the One as long as any other image remains active in the soul. To this end, you must set free your soul from all outward things and turn wholly within yourself, with no more leaning to what lies outside, and lay your mind bare of ideal forms, as before of the objects of sense, and forget even yourself, and so come within sight of that One. [6.9.7]&lt;br&gt;* "If he remembers who he became when he merged with the One, he will bear its image in himself. He was himself one, with no diversity in himself or his outward relations; for no movement was in him, no passion, no desire for another, once the ascent was accomplished. Nor indeed was there any reason or though, nor, if we dare say it, any trace of himself." [6.9.11.]}} one can reach a [[tabula rasa]], a blank state where the individual may grasp or merge with The One. This absolute simplicity means that the nous or the person is then dissolved, completely absorbed back into the Monad. 

Within the [[Enneads]] of Plotinus the Monad can be referred to as the Good above the demiurge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]] By Richard T. Wallis, Jay Bregman, [[International Society for Neoplatonic Studies]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSbrLPup7wYC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Anti-Gnostic+Polemic+Francisco+Garcia+Bazan+translated+from+Spanish+by+Winifred+T.+Slater+Nous+as+a+%22Second+God%22+According+to+Plotinus+In+Enneads&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rSxQIFc5YE&amp;sig=EgX8IOF26MK-n7CoWUpDONI1sFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA55,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M.

All division is reconciled in the one, the final stage before reaching singularity, called duality (dyad), is completely reconciled in the Monad, Source or One (see [[monism]]). As the one, source or substance of all things the Monad is all encompassing. As infinite and indeterminate all is reconciled in the dunamis or one. It is the demiurge or second emanation that is the nous in Plotinus. It is the demiurge (creator, action, energy) or nous that "perceives" and therefore causes the force (potential or One) to manifest as energy, or the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]] called the material world. Nous as being, being and perception (intellect) manifest what is called soul ([[Anima mundi|World Soul]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]] By Richard T. Wallis, Jay Bregman, [[International Society for Neoplatonic Studies]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=WSbrLPup7wYC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Anti-Gnostic+Polemic+Francisco+Garcia+Bazan+translated+from+Spanish+by+Winifred+T.+Slater+Nous+as+a+%22Second+God%22+According+to+Plotinus+In+Enneads&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rSxQIFc5YE&amp;sig=EgX8IOF26MK-n7CoWUpDONI1sFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA55,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Plotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with Aristotle but also various World religions that he had personal contact with during his various travels. Plotinus' works have an [[ascetic]] character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent). Matter was strictly treated as [[immanent]], with matter as essential to its being, having no true or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendential]] character or essence, substance or ousia. This approach is called philosophical [[Idealism]].{{refn|group=note|[[Schopenhauer]] wrote of this [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher: "With [[Plotinus]] there even appears, probably for the first time in [[Western philosophy]], ''idealism'' that had long been current in the [[East]] even at that time, for it taught ([[Enneads]], iii, lib. vii, c.10) that the [[soul]] has made the [[world]] by stepping from [[eternity]] into [[time]], with the explanation: 'For there is for this [[universe]] no other place than the soul or [[mind]]' (neque est alter hujus universi locus quam anima), indeed the ideality of time is expressed in the words: 'We should not accept time outside the soul or mind' (oportet autem nequaquam extra animam tempus accipere)."&lt;ref&gt;(''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy," § 7)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Iamblichus of Chalcis==
{{see also|Greek hero cult}}

Within the works of [[Iamblichus of Chalcis]] (c. 245 – c. 325 AD), The One and reconciliation of division can be obtained through the process of [[theurgy]]. By mimicking the demiurge, the individual is returned to the cosmos to implement the will of the divine mind. One goes through a series of theurgy or [[ritual]]s that unites the initiate to the Monad. These rituals mimic the ordering of the chaos of the Universe into the material world or [[cosmos]]. They also mimic the actions of the [[demiurge]] as the creator of the material world. Iamblichus used the rituals of the mystery religions to perform rituals on the individual to unite their outer and inner person. Thus one without conflict internal or external is united (henosis) and is The One (hen).

==Eastern Orthodox Christianity==
In [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]], but also in western mysticism, ''henosis''  can be acquired by [[theoria]], [[hesychasm]] and [[Christian contemplation|contemplative prayer]]. Yet, the concept of [[Theosis (Eastern Christian theology)|theosis]], or deification, differs from henosis, since created beings cannot become God in His transcendent essence, or [[ousia]].

In [[computer science]], a '''holographic algorithm''' is an algorithm that uses a holographic reduction. A holographic reduction is a constant-time [[Reduction (complexity)|reduction]] that maps solution fragments many-to-many such that the sum of the solution fragments remains unchanged. These concepts were introduced by [[Leslie Valiant]], who called them ''holographic'' because "their effect can be viewed as that of producing interference patterns among the solution fragments".&lt;ref name="valiant"&gt;{{cite conference

&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithms are unrelated to laser [[holography]], except metaphorically. Their power comes from the mutual cancellation of many contributions to a sum, analogous to the interference patterns in a hologram.&lt;ref name="americanscientist"/&gt;

Holographic algorithms have been used to find [[P (complexity)|polynomial-time]] solutions to problems without such previously known solutions for special cases of [[Boolean satisfiability problem|satisfiability]], [[vertex cover]], and other [[graph theory|graph problems]].&lt;ref name="art"/&gt; They have received notable coverage due to speculation that they are relevant to the [[P versus NP problem]]&lt;ref name="americanscientist"&gt;{{cite journal

Although some of the general problems are [[Sharp-P|#P-hard]] problems, the special cases solved are not themselves #P-hard, and thus do not prove FP = #P.

Holographic algorithms have some similarities with [[quantum computation]], but are completely classical.&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;{{cite journal

==Holant problems==
Holographic algorithms exist in the context of Holant problems, which generalize counting [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s (#CSP). A #CSP instance is a [[hypergraph]] ''G''=(''V'',''E'') called the [[constraint graph]]. Each hyperedge represents a variable and each vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is assigned a constraint &lt;math&gt;f_v.&lt;/math&gt; A vertex is connected to an hyperedge if the constraint on the vertex involves the variable on the hyperedge. The counting problem is to compute
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\sigma : E \to \{0,1\}} \prod_{v \in V} f_v(\sigma|_{E(v)}),~~~~~~~~~~(1)&lt;/math&gt;
which is a sum over all variable assignments, the product of every constraint, where the inputs to the constrain &lt;math&gt;f_v&lt;/math&gt; are the variables on the incident hyperedges of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.

A Holant problem is like a #CSP except the input must be a graph, not a hypergraph. Restricting the class of input graphs in this way is indeed a generalization. Given a #CSP instance, replace each hyperedge ''e'' of size ''s'' with a vertex ''v'' of degree ''s'' with edges incident to the vertices contained in ''e''. The constraint on ''v'' is the equality function of arity ''s''.  This identifies all of the variables on the edges incident to ''v'', which is the same effect as the single variable on the hyperedge ''e''.

In the context of Holant problems, the expression in (1) is called the Holant after a related exponential sum introduced by Valiant.&lt;ref name="fibonacci"&gt;{{cite conference

==Holographic reduction==
A standard technique in complexity theory is a [[many-one reduction]], where an instance of one problem is reduced to an instance of another (hopefully simpler) problem.
However, holographic reductions between two computational problems preserve the sum of solutions without necessarily preserving correspondences between solutions.&lt;ref name="valiant"/&gt;  For instance, the total number of solutions in both sets can be preserved, even though individual problems do not have matching solutions. The sum can also be weighted, rather than simply counting the number of solutions, using [[Basis (linear algebra)|linear basis vectors]].&lt;ref name="art"&gt;{{cite journal

===General example===
It is convenient to consider holographic reductions on bipartite graphs. A general graph can always be transformed it into a bipartite graph while preserving the Holant value. This is done by replacing each edge in the graph by a path of length 2, which is also known as the 2-stretch of the graph. To keep the same Holant value, each new vertex is assigned the binary equality constraint.

Consider a bipartite graph ''G''=(''U'',''V'',''E'') where the constraint assigned to every vertex &lt;math&gt;u \in U&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f_u&lt;/math&gt; and the constraint assigned to every vertex &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f_v&lt;/math&gt;. Denote this counting problem by &lt;math&gt;\text{Holant}(G, f_u, f_v).&lt;/math&gt; If the vertices in ''U'' are viewed as one large vertex of degree |''E''|, then the constraint of this vertex is the [[tensor product]] of &lt;math&gt;f_u&lt;/math&gt; with itself |''U''| times, which is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f_u^{\otimes |U|}.&lt;/math&gt; Likewise, if the vertices in ''V'' are viewed as one large vertex of degree |''E''|, then the constraint of this vertex is &lt;math&gt;f_v^{\otimes |V|}.&lt;/math&gt; Let the constraint &lt;math&gt;f_u&lt;/math&gt; be represented by its weighted [[truth table]] as a row vector and the constraint &lt;math&gt;f_v&lt;/math&gt; be represented by its weighted truth table as a column vector. Then the Holant of this constraint graph is simply &lt;math&gt;f_u^{\otimes |U|} f_v^{\otimes |V|}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now for any complex 2-by-2 [[invertible matrix]] ''T'' (the columns of which are the linear basis vectors mentioned above), there is a holographic reduction between &lt;math&gt;\text{Holant}(G, f_u, f_v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{Holant}(G, f_u T^{\otimes (\deg u)}, (T^{-1})^{\otimes (\deg v)} f_v).&lt;/math&gt; To see this, insert the identity matrix &lt;math&gt;T^{\otimes |E|} (T^{-1})^{\otimes |E|}&lt;/math&gt; in between &lt;math&gt;f_u^{\otimes |U|} f_v^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt; to get
:&lt;math&gt;f_u^{\otimes |U|} f_v^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= f_u^{\otimes |U|} T^{\otimes |E|} (T^{-1})^{\otimes |E|} f_v^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \left(f_u T^{\otimes (\deg u)}\right)^{\otimes |U|} \left(f_v (T^{-1})^{\otimes (\deg v)}\right)^{\otimes |V|}.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, &lt;math&gt;\text{Holant}(G, f_u, f_v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{Holant}(G, f_u T^{\otimes (\deg u)}, (T^{-1})^{\otimes (\deg v)} f_v)&lt;/math&gt; have exactly the same Holant value for every constraint graph. They essentially define the same counting problem.

===Specific examples===

====Vertex covers and independent sets====
Let ''G'' be a graph. There is a 1-to-1 correspondence between the [[vertex cover]]s of ''G'' and the [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]]s of ''G''. For any set ''S'' of vertices of ''G'', ''S'' is a vertex cover in ''G'' if and only if the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''S'' is an independent set in ''G''. Thus, the number of vertex covers in ''G'' is exactly the same as the number of independent sets in ''G''.

The equivalence of these two counting problems can also be proved using a holographic reduction. For simplicity, let ''G'' be a 3-[[regular graph]]. The 2-stretch of ''G'' gives a bipartite graph ''H''=(''U'',''V'',''E''), where ''U'' corresponds to the edges in ''G'' and ''V'' corresponds to the vertices in ''G''. The Holant problem that naturally corresponds to counting the number of vertex covers in ''G'' is &lt;math&gt;\text{Holant}(H, \text{OR}_2, \text{EQUAL}_3).&lt;/math&gt; The truth table of OR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a row vector is (0,1,1,1). The truth table of EQUAL&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a column vector is &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1)^T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3}&lt;/math&gt;. Then under a holographic transformation by &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{OR}_2^{\otimes |U|} \text{EQUAL}_3^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= (0,1,1,1)^{\otimes |U|} \left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3}\right)^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= (0,1,1,1)^{\otimes |U|} \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes |E|} \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes |E|} \left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3}\right)^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \left((0,1,1,1) \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 2}\right)^{\otimes |U|} \left(\left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\right)^{\otimes 3} + \left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\right)^{\otimes 3}\right)^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= (1,1,1,0)^{\otimes |U|} \left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3} + \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3}\right)^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \text{NAND}_2^{\otimes |U|} \text{EQUAL}_3^{\otimes |V|},&lt;/math&gt;
which is &lt;math&gt;\text{Holant}(H, \text{NAND}_2, \text{EQUAL}_3),&lt;/math&gt; the Holant problem that naturally corresponds to counting the number of independent sets in ''G''.

==History==
As with any type of reduction, a holographic reduction does not, by itself, yield a polynomial time algorithm. In order to get a polynomial time algorithm, the problem being reduced to must also have a polynomial time algorithm. Valiant's original application of holographic algorithms used a holographic reduction to a problem where every constraint is realizable by [[matchgates]],&lt;ref name="valiant"/&gt; which he had just proved is tractable by a further reduction to counting the number of [[perfect matching]]s in a [[planar graph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter problem is tractable by the [[FKT algorithm]], which dates to the 1960s.

Soon after, Valiant found holographic algorithms with reductions to matchgates for #[[modulo operation|&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]][[Planar graph|Pl]]-Rtw-[[Monotonic function#Boolean functions|Mon]]-3[[Conjunctive normal form|CNF]] and #&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Pl-3/2[[bipartite graph|Bip]]-[[vertex cover|VC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These problems may appear somewhat contrived, especially with respect to the [[Modular arithmetic|modulus]]. Both problems were already known to be #P-hard when ignoring the modulus and Valiant supplied proofs of #P-hardness modulo 2, which also used holographic reductions. Valiant found these two problems by a computer search that looked for problems with holographic reductions to matchgates. He called their algorithms ''accidental algorithms'', saying "when applying the term accidental to an algorithm we intend to point out that the algorithm arises from satisfying an apparently onerous set of constraints." The "onerous" set of constraints in question are polynomial equations that, if satisfied, imply the existence of a holographic reduction to matchgate realizable constraints.

After several years of developing (what is known as) matchgate signature theory, Jin-Yi Cai and Pinyan Lu were able to explain the existence of Valiant's two accidental algorithms.&lt;ref name="art"/&gt;  These two problems are just special cases of two much larger families of problems: #&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;Pl-Rtw-Mon-kCNF and #&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;Pl-k/2Bip-VC for any positive integer ''k''. The modulus 7 is just the third [[Mersenne number]] and Cai and Lu showed that these types of problems with parameter ''k'' can be solved in polynomial time exactly when the modulus is the ''k''th Mersenne number by using holographic reductions to matchgates and the [[Chinese remainder theorem]].

Around the same time, Jin-Yi Cai, Pinyan Lu and Mingji Xia gave the first holographic algorithm that did not reduce to a problem that is tractable by matchgates.&lt;ref name="fibonacci"/&gt; Instead, they reduced to a problem that is tractable by Fibonacci gates, which are [[symmetric function|symmetric]] constraints whose truth tables satisfy a [[recurrence relation]] similar to one that defines the [[Fibonacci number]]s. They also used holographic reductions to prove that certain counting problems are #P-hard. Since then, holographic reductions have been used extensively as ingredients in both polynomial time algorithms and proofs of #P-hardness.

The '''Hong Kong 1956 riots''' were the result of escalating provocations between pro-[[Chinese Nationalist|Nationalist]] and pro-[[Communist Party of China|Communist]] factions in Hong Kong during [[Double Ten Day]], 10 October 1956.&lt;ref name="hkh1"&gt;HKheadline.com.

Most violence took place in the town of [[Tsuen Wan]], five miles from central Kowloon. A mob stormed and ransacked a clinic and welfare centre, killing four people. Some foreigners became involved, including a Swiss national who lost his life while travelling in a taxi on [[Nathan Road]].&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,824497,00.html "Hong Kong: Trouble on the Double Ten"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' Monday, 22 Oct. 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

To quell the rioting, [[Chief Secretary for Administration|Colonial Secretary]] [[Edgeworth B. David]] ordered extra manpower from the [[British Forces Overseas Hong Kong|British Forces Hong Kong]], including armoured troops of  [[The Queen's Royal Hussars|7th Hussars]], to reinforce the [[Hong Kong Police]] and disperse the rioters.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;  In total, there were 59 deaths and approximately 500 injuries.

In the subsequent trials four people were convicted of murder and given death penalties.

[[Andreas Cellarius]], German mathematician and cartographer (1596–1665), conceived an Atlas of the Universe, published in 1660, under the title of ''[[Harmonia Macrocosmica]]''. Numerous illustrations of the solar system appear in this atlas by different authors known at that time. Referring to Ptolemy, Cellarius called the representation of this Ptolemaic conception of heaven as "Imago universi secundum Ptolaeum"

''Imago'' is a word in [[Latin]] which means'' 'image''' or even "representation". Therefore, the title expresses the "Picture of the Universe according to Ptolemy." The Latin expression was used in the Middle Ages to express the representation and size of the known world at that time.

''Imago Universi'' is also the title, in Latin, of a [[cosmography|cosmographic]] treatise, written in 2013 by the Spanish scientist Gabriel Barceló.

After analyzing the history of cosmology, the treatise delves into the prevailing scientific lack of explanation of the rotation of the heavenly bodies in the laws of dynamic behaviour of the sidereal system. The author proposes the application of the [[Theory of Dynamic Interactions]] (TID) to astrophysics, in particular, the dynamics of stellar systems and galaxies. This theory allows new comprehension of the dynamics of nature and understands the dynamic equilibrium of the universe, always subjected to rotational accelerations, but repetitive and persistent. The author also highlights that the orbiting always coincides with the intrinsic rotation of celestial bodies. Paradox incorporating the book, noting that this had not been found to date.

'''Intentism''' is an [[art movement]] founded by Vittorio Pelosi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vittoriopelosi.webs.com/biography.htm www.vittoriopelosi.webs.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intentists have staged various exhibitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1stangel.co.uk/|title=1stAngel Arts – Life in and around the arts today|website=1stangel.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have spoken at Universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.ac.uk/alumni/bulletin09/mar/March%202009.html|title=University of the Arts London Alumni Bulletin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[University of the Arts London]]. In 2009 their [[manifesto]] was published in ''Intentism - The Resurrection of the author''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ACXBVG|title=www.amazon.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and origin==
Intentists come from a variety of backgrounds but are all questioning ideas related to the meaning of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intentismcommunity.webs.com/alumniinterview.htm|title=Intentism|website=Intentism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Intentism is a response to the debate around [[authorial intent]].&lt;ref name="culturewars.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturewars.org.uk/index.php/site/article/intentism_the_resurrection_of_the_author/|title=Culture Wars - Intentism – the Resurrection of the Author|website=www.culturewars.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the public debates that launched intentism, Vittorio Pelosi cited four key schools that the new movement sought to challenge. These include the so-called "[[Authorial intent|The Intentional Fallacy]]" published by [[Monroe Beardsley|Monroe Beardley]] and [[William K. Wimsatt|William Wimsatt]], which maintained that "The design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Intentism: Public Debates 2009- 2011|last=Pelosi|first=Vittorio|publisher=Intentism Publishing House|year=2011|isbn=9781326730598|location=|pages=15-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the case of the French philosopher [[Roland Barthes]], who, in 1967, declared that the author is dead and that his work is nothing but a "tissue of quotations" and that the impression of the reader is more important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also cited [[Jacques Derrida]]'s [[Deconstruction|deconstruction theory]], which critiques the relationship of text and meaning, and exposes meaning that run counter to what was intended by the author. Finally, Pelosi identified [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]'s theory that a text's meaning can change over time due to the changes that transpire in society. According to the thinker, these theories are outdated and that there is an imperative to identify, celebrate, and recognize the relationship between the artist and his creation because "all meaning is the imperfect outworking of intention."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Manifesto==
Intentists believe that art can convey an artist's intended message to his or her intended audience. As a movement it both recognizes and celebrates the relationship between an artist's creation and its creator.&lt;ref name="intentism.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intentism.com/manifesto.htm|title=Intentism|website=Intentism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Intentists believe three principles:&lt;ref name="intentism.com"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
::#Intentists believe that the artist is free to convey his or her intended message. The meaning of the work is found in the artist's intention and not the interpretation of the viewer. All meaning is simply the imperfect outworking of intention.&lt;ref name="culturewars.org.uk"/&gt;
::#Intentists believe a confused, hidden or denied intention leads to zero accountability.
::#Intentists believe that an omission of artist intention can lead to enforced restrictions on the artist and even censorship.

==Public debates and lectures==
Intentism has been the subject of several public debates. In 2009 The [[University of the Arts London]] held a Panel Discussion around Intentism entitled 'Intentism: Is an artist free to convey his or her intended message?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.ac.uk/alumni/bulletin09/mar/March%202009.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, The [[Royal College of Art]], held a debate on Intentism named 'Rebirth of the Author?'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.battleofideas.org.uk/index.php/2011/session_detail/5750/]&lt;/ref&gt; Intentists have also given several Lectures at various art institutions including The [[University of East London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intentism.com/news.htm|title=Intentism|website=Intentism}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the University of Kent.

Intentist artists work in numerous ways, but at present there appears to be three areas that are of particular interest. Firstly, Intentists often celebrate the artist's intentions in the work by including the entire process of creating art in the final piece. Consequently, elements of every editing decision is left in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1stangel.co.uk/|title=1stAngel Arts – Life in and around the arts today|website=1stangel.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intentists call this process ''Palimpsestism'' and the ''Intentional Trail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intentismcommunity.webs.com/advertiserint2.htm|title=Intentism|website=Intentism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Secondly, since authorial irony can only be understood by comparing what is said (the work), and what is meant (author intent), it is a common subject for Intentist artists. An example here would be Luciano Pelosi’s Big Breakfast. Thirdly, much art theory finds its origin in [[Literary theory]]. It is a claim of the Intentists that in certain fundamental areas this cross over is not valid. In literature the author has a linear order expectation for the text since the viewer will normally start at the beginning and read letters sequentially until the end. However, this approach is not appropriate for the static arts. Most paintings and sculptures are anarrative as viewers can approach the work in multiple orders. Therefore, this basis for ignoring the artist’s intentions is not relevant. An example of an Intentist artist creating work to demonstrate these anarrative properties is Govinda Sah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://govindasah.com|title=Govinda 'Sah' Azad|website=govindasah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The School of Postmodernism==
[[File:School of pomo.jpg|thumb|The School of Postmodernism by Vittorio Pelosi]]
Vittorio Pelosi's painting The School of [[Postmodernism]], inspired by [[Raphael]]'s [[The School of Athens]], is one of the best known paintings to come out of the Intentist movement and replaces all of Raphael's Athenian philosophers with [[Postmodern]] icons. Each figure is attempting an objective depiction of the life model, but their work is subjected to their postmodernist ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intentismcommunity.webs.com/schoolofpomo.htm|title=Intentism|website=Intentism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Intentists regularly exhibit their work, both in solo Intentist exhibitions and Intentist group shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intentism.com/exhibitions.htm|title=Intentism|website=Intentism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''kishka''' is a type of [[prison]] cell used in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] prisons.  The cell was named after the gut ({{lang-ru|[[wikt:кишка|кишка]]}}, ''[[Intestine|kíshka]]''), in that it was tall and narrow, like an [[intestine]], but more like a chimney.  The prisoner had room to stand, but could not sit or kneel, let alone lie down.  In some Soviet prisons there was no drainage and the prisoner was forced to excrete standing up and to stand in his own urine and feces.  In some cases the cells were never cleaned. Prisoners could be held in these cells for days at a time.

{{quote|[[Sławomir Rawicz|Rawicz]] was transferred to an immense fortress prison in [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]], Ukraine, where he became the personal project of a huge, muscular – and inventively sadistic – NKVD major known as "The Bull." "He ran his interrogation sessions like an eminent surgeon, always showing off his skill before a changing crowd of junior officers," reflected Rawicz. "His methods were despicably ingenious."

One of'' The Bull's ''preferred methods of breaking his subjects' will was to insert them in a kishka. No provision was made for the inmates' bodily functions and the kishkas were never cleaned. Each day, Rawicz would be hauled out of his tiny cell, hosed off, and sent to The Bull for interrogation and torture.&lt;ref&gt;''Freedom Trek'' Grigg, William Norman

The '''[[Causses|Causse]] du Larzac''' is a [[limestone]] [[karst]] [[plateau]] in the south of the [[Massif Central]], [[France]], situated between [[Millau]] ([[Aveyron]]) and [[Lodève]] ([[Hérault]]). It is an agricultural area, where [[Lacaune (sheep)|sheep]] produce milk for [[Roquefort cheese]].

==Geography==
The [[communes of France|communes]] of the Larzac are:
*[[Cornus, Aveyron|Cornus]]
*[[Creissels]]
*[[La Cavalerie]]
*[[La Couvertoirade]]
*[[La Roque-Sainte-Marguerite]]
*[[L'Hospitalet-du-Larzac]]
*[[Le Caylar]]
*[[Le Cros]]
*[[Les Rives]]
*[[Millau]]
*[[Nant, Aveyron|Nant]]
*[[Saint-Félix-de-l'Héras]]
*[[Saint-Georges-de-Luzençon]]
*[[Saint-Maurice-Navacelles]]
*[[Saint-Michel-d'Alajou]]
*[[Saint-Pierre-de-la-Fage]]
*[[Sainte-Eulalie-de-Cernon]]
*[[Sorbs, Hérault|Sorbs]]
*[[La Vacquerie-et-Saint-Martin-de-Castries]]
*[[Vissec]]

The Larzac is served by junctions 46 to 51 of the [[A75 autoroute]].

==History==
{{Main| Fight for the Larzac}}
In October 1970, [[Michel Debré]],  the French Minister of Defense, decided for strategic purposes to expand a military camp outside the village of La Cavalerie in the French ''[[Departments of France|département]]'' of [[Aveyron]], from 30&amp;nbsp;km² to 170&amp;nbsp;km², without consulting the local population. Local farmers objected and decided to fight against the project, through actions such as occupation of empty farms purchased by the Army in anticipation of this expansion. French syndicalist and peasant activist [[José Bové]] moved there during this period in support of the protests. Communards from the nearby Community of the Ark, led by the pacifist [[Lanza del Vasto]], were also very active in opposition to the camp. The workers of the occupied and self-managed [[Lip factory]] also took part in the movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/jean-paul-margnac/sets/72157594436265379/ Lip Larzac 1973 - photos]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ten years of [[nonviolent resistance]], the plan was cancelled by President [[François Mitterrand]] after his election in 1981.

Because of its history it was chosen as the site of a massive meeting against the [[World Trade Organization]] which took place in August 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monde-solidaire.org/larzac-2003/uk/ “The World Is Not For Sale” Gathering on the Larzac against the world trade organization (8-10 August 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Bové]] currently resides in Larzac - he secured nearly 500,000 votes in the 2007 presidential elections.

==Sights==
Five medieval fortified villages, related to the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] are located on the Larzac plateau: 
* [[La Cavalerie]]
* [[La Couvertoirade]]
* Saint-Jean-d'Alcas,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aveyron.com/english/tourism/templar-alcas.html Saint-Jean-d'Alcas]&lt;/ref&gt; part of the [[Saint-Jean-et-Saint-Paul]] [[commune in France|commune]]
* [[Sainte-Eulalie-de-Cernon]]
* [[Viala-du-Pas-de-Jaux]]

==History==
The English expression "a [[Birmingham]] [[screwdriver]]" meaning a hammer, references the habit of using the one tool for all purposes, and predates both Kaplan and Maslow by at least a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Jonathon|title=Dictionary of Slang|year=1998|publisher=Cassell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1868, a London periodical, ''[[Once A Week (magazine)|Once a Week]]'', contained this observation: "Give a boy a hammer and chisel; show him how to use them; at once he begins to hack the doorposts, to take off the corners of shutter and window frames, until you teach him a better use for them, and how to keep his activity within bounds."&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator"/&gt;

==Abraham Kaplan==
The first recorded statement of the concept was [[Abraham Kaplan]]'s, in 1964: "I call it ''the law of the instrument,'' and it may be formulated as follows: Give a small boy a hammer, and he will find that everything he encounters needs pounding."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science
 | author = Abraham Kaplan
 | publisher = San Francisco: Chandler Publishing Co
 | year = 1964
 | page = 28
 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OYe6fsXSP3IC&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1962, [[Abraham Kaplan]], then a Professor of Philosophy, gave a banquet speech at a conference of the [[American Educational Research Association]] that was being held at [[UCLA]]. An article in the June 1962 issue of the ''Journal of Medical Education'' stated that "the highlight of the 3-day meeting ... was to be found in Kaplan's comment on the choice of methods for research. He urged that scientists exercise good judgment in the selection of appropriate methods for their research. Because certain methods happen to be handy, or a given individual has been trained to use a specific method, is no assurance that the method is appropriate for all problems. He cited Kaplan’s Law of the Instrument: 'Give a boy a hammer and everything he meets has to be pounded.{{'"}}

In ''The Conduct of Inquiry: Methodology for Behavioral Science'' (1964), Kaplan again mentioned the law of the instrument saying, "It comes as no particular surprise to discover that a scientist formulates problems in a way which requires for their solution just those techniques in which he himself is especially skilled." And in a 1964 article for ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'', he again cited the law and commented: "We tend to formulate our problems in such a way as to make it seem that the solutions to those problems demand precisely what we already happen to have at hand."&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator"&gt;{{cite web|title=If Your Only Tool Is a Hammer Then Every Problem Looks Like a Nail|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/05/08/hammer-nail/|website=Quote Investigator|publisher=Quote Investigator|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tomkins and Colby==

In a 1963 essay collection, ''Computer Simulation of Personality: Frontier of Psychological Theory'', [[Silvan Tomkins]] wrote about "the tendency of jobs to be adapted to tools, rather than adapting tools to jobs". He wrote: "If one has a hammer one tends to look for nails, and if one has a computer with a storage capacity, but no feelings, one is more likely to concern oneself with remembering and with problem solving than with loving and hating." In the same book, [[Kenneth Mark Colby]] explicitly cited the law, writing: "The First Law of the Instrument states that if you give a boy a hammer, he suddenly finds that everything needs pounding. The computer program may be our current hammer, but it must be tried. One cannot decide from purely armchair considerations whether or not it will be of any value."&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator"/&gt;

==Abraham Maslow==

''Maslow's hammer,'' popularly phrased as "[[wikt:if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail|if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail]]" and variants thereof, is from Abraham Maslow's ''The Psychology of Science'', published in 1966. [[Abraham Maslow]] wrote: "I remember seeing an elaborate and complicated automatic washing machine for automobiles that did a beautiful job of washing them. But it could do only that, and everything else that got into its clutches was treated as if it were an automobile to be washed. I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail."&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator"/&gt;&lt;ref name=maslow66&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Robert Kagan==
In his 2003 book, ''[[Of Paradise and Power]]'', historian [[Robert Kagan]] suggested a corollary to the law: "When you don't have a hammer, you don't want anything to look like a nail." According to Kagan, the corollary explains the difference in views on the use of military force the United States and Europe have held since the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Robert Kagan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kagan|first1=Robert|title=Of Paradise and Power: America and Europe in the New World Order|date=January 2004|publisher=Vintage Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75GLDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Robert%20Kagan%22%20%22When%20you%20don't%20have%20a%20hammer%2C%20you%20don't%20want%20anything%20to%20look%20like%20a%20nail.%22|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lee Loevinger==
In 1967, [[Lee Loevinger]] of the [[Federal Communications Commission]] dubbed the law "Loevinger's law of irresistible use", and applied it to government: "The political science analogue is that if there is a government agency, this proves something needs regulating."

In 1984, investor [[Warren Buffett]] criticized academic studies of financial markets that made use of inappropriate mathematical approaches: "It isn't necessarily because such studies have any utility; it's simply that the data are there and academicians have worked hard to learn the mathematical skills needed to manipulate them. Once these skills are acquired, it seems sinful not to use them, even if the usage has no utility or negative utility. As a friend said, to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail."&lt;ref name="Quote Investigator"/&gt;

==Manifestations==
===Psychiatry===

One application the law of the instrument has been observed in is the prescribing usage of [[anti-psychotic]] drugs. During Maslow's era, the only medicines available for psychiatric patients were the anti-psychotics [[stelazine]] and [[thorazine]], so it was often the case that other  mental illnesses were treated as if they were [[psychoses]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Computer programming===
The notion of a ''golden hammer,'' "a familiar technology or concept applied obsessively to many software problems", was introduced into [[information technology]] literature in 1998 as an [[anti-pattern]]: a programming practice to be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | title = AntiPatterns: Refactoring Software, Architectures, and Projects in Crisis
 |author1=William J. Brown |author2=Raphael C. Malveau |author3=Hays W. "Skip" McCormick |author4=Thomas J. Mowbray | publisher = Wiley
 | year = 1998
 | isbn = 978-0-471-19713-3
 | page = 111
 | url = https://www.amazon.com/AntiPatterns-Refactoring-Software-Architectures-Projects/dp/0471197130/
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software developer José M. Gilgado has written that the law is still relevant in the 21st century and is highly applicable to software development. Many times software developers, he observed, "tend to use the same known tools to do a completely new different project with new constraints". He blamed this on "the [[comfort zone]] state where you don't change anything to avoid risk. The problem with using the same tools every time you can is that you don't have enough arguments to make a choice because you have nothing to compare to and is limiting your knowledge." The solution is "to keep looking for the best possible choice, even if we aren't very familiar with it". This includes using a computer language with which one is unfamiliar. He noted that the product [[RubyMotion]] enables developers to "wrap" unknown computer languages in a familiar computer language and thus avoid having to learn them. But Gilgado found this approach inadvisable, because it reinforces the habit of avoiding new tools.&lt;ref name="Jose M Dev"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gilgado|first1=José|title=Avoiding the law of the instrument|url=http://josemdev.com/articles/avoiding-the-law-of-the-instrument/|website=Jose M Dev|publisher=Jose M Dev|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
One observer stated in 2016 that the law of the instrument may be "the least discussed law when talking about education", but is "the most important to warn for in educational discussions". He asked: "How many times do you read: this tool will change everything in education? We know that it won’t, but most of the time the person expressing this is really convinced of his hammer." Some educators say: "let’s teach all children how to code".&lt;ref name="The Economy of Meaning"&gt;{{cite web|title=The "Law of the instrument"|url=https://theeconomyofmeaning.com/2016/12/18/the-law-of-the-instrument/|website=The Economy of Meaning|publisher=The Economy of Meaning|accessdate=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several authors have put forth arguments concerning the '''[[legality]] of the [[War on Drugs]]'''. In his essay ''The Drug War and the Constitution'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulhager.org/libertarian/drug_con.html |title=The Drug War and the Constitution |last=Hager |first=Paul |year=1991 |work=The Libertarian Corner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian philosopher Paul Hager makes the case that the War on Drugs in the United States is an illegal form of prohibition, which violates the principles of a limited government embodied in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].

==Federalism argument==
In her dissent in ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' (a case argued by [[Randy Barnett]]), [[Supreme Court of the United States|Justice]] [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] argued that drug prohibition is an improper usurpation of the [[commerce clause|power to regulate interstate commerce]], and the power to prohibit should be [[states rights|reserved by the states]]. In the same case, Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] wrote a stronger dissent expressing a similar idea. Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]] joined O'Connor's dissent.

==Substantive due process==
Another argument against drug prohibition is based on the notion that its practice violates implicit rights within the [[substantive due process]] doctrine. It has been suggested that anti-drug laws do not achieve enough reasonable benefit to State interests to justify arbitrarily restricting basic individual liberties that are supposed to be guaranteed by the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the US Constitution. One proponent of this notion is attorney [[Warren Redlich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.redlichlaw.com/crim/substantive-due-process-drug-war.pdf |title=A Substantive Due Process Challenge to the War on Drugs |last=Redlich |first=Warren |authorlink=Warren Redlich |date=2005-02-05 |format=PDF |quote=It is true that the approach suggested in this paper would limit police power. Constitutional protection of individual rights exists for that very purpose. We face coercive government action, carried out in a corrupt and racist manner, with military and paramilitary assaults on our homes, leading to mass incarceration and innocent deaths. We can never forget the tyranny of a government unrestrained by an independent judiciary. Our courts must end the War on Drugs. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217035034/http://www.redlichlaw.com/crim/substantive-due-process-drug-war.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the U.S. State of Florida attempted to eliminate criminal intent as an element of the crime of drug possession. On July 27, 2011, U.S. District Judge Mary S. Scriven ruled that the Florida law was unconstitutional, saying that the elimination of the element of intent was "atavistic and repugnant to the common law". Nellie King, president of the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, explained the ruling in terms of due process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/federal-judge-rules-floridas-drug-law-unconstitutional-1665859.html |title=Federal judge rules Florida's drug law unconstitutional |last=Spencer-Wendel |first=Susan |date=July 28, 2011 |work=Palm Beach Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling is subject to appeal.

The substantive due process argument is sometimes used in [[medical marijuana]] cases. [[NORML]] once wrote in an [[amicus brief]] on ''[[United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Cooperative]]'' that the right to use [[medical marijuana]] to save one's life is within the rights established by the substantive due process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norml.org/index.cfm?Group_ID=4950 Amicus brief] NORML&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] found against the medical [[marijuana dispensary]] and for the United States in the aforementioned case. Some&lt;!--as in some Wikipedia editors--&gt; apparently believe that this invalidates the substantive due process argument against the [[Controlled Substances Act]].

However, the Supreme Court expressly ''declined'' to rule on the issue of substantive due process in the aforementioned case, ruling against the medical [[marijuana dispensary]] in question on grounds of statutory construction, as the Court found that there was no standalone medical necessity defense in the Controlled Substances Act. Justice Clarence Thomas' majority opinion clearly explains that the Court did not consider any Constitutional arguments in coming to the conclusion that it reached. As Justice Thomas expressly states in his majority opinion: "Finally, the Cooperative contends that we should construe the Controlled Substances Act to include a medical necessity defense in order to avoid what it considers to be difficult constitutional questions. In particular, the Cooperative asserts that, shorn of a medical necessity defense, the statute exceeds Congress’ Commerce Clause powers, violates the substantive due process rights of patients, and offends the fundamental liberties of the people under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth]], [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth]], and [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth]] Amendments. As the Cooperative acknowledges, however, the canon of constitutional avoidance has no application in the absence of statutory ambiguity. Because we have no doubt that the Controlled Substances Act cannot bear a medical necessity defense to distributions of marijuana, we do not find guidance in this avoidance principle. Nor do we consider the underlying constitutional issues today. Because the Court of Appeals did not address these claims, we decline to do so in the first instance."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-151.ZO.html United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyer's Cooperative, Majority Opinion of Justice Thomas] United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyer's Cooperative&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the question of the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act under the doctrine of substantive due process remains an open one, undecided by the Supreme Court, and debated by the citizens of the United States. Even some opponents of the substantive due process argument who support the War on Drugs have noted that the doctrine could potentially lead to the invalidation of anti-drug laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boalt.org/bjcl/v8/v8tennenprint.htm Is the Constitution in Harm's Way? Substantive Due Process and Criminal Law] Eric Tennen&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rule of law==

It is argued that the reverse [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] in drug-possession cases is incompatible with the [[rule of law]] in that the power to convict is effectively taken from the courts and given to those who are willing to plant evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlanta.indymedia.org/local/universally-unconstitutional-war-drugs-3rd-ed |title=The universally unconstitutional war on drugs (3rd Ed.) |last=Anon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freedom of religion and conscience==

{{further|Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal|Cognitive liberty}}

A special problem is created by government prohibition of [[psychedelic drug]]s such as [[LSD]], [[peyote]], [[magic mushrooms|psilocybin mushrooms]], [[cannabis]], and [[ayahuasca]].  Some people use such substances with definite cognitive, spiritual or religious motives. Use of [[peyote]] and [[ayahuasca]] is currently legal in the US for members of certain recognized religions (e.g., [[Native American Church]]).  However nothing in the [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|Free Exercise clause of the First Amendment]] implies that sincere and responsible exercise of freedom of religion or conscience requires formal affiliation with an established religious denomination.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2844">The '''Mansion of Many Apartments''' is a metaphor that the [[poetry|poet]] [[John Keats]] expressed in a letter to [[John Hamilton Reynolds]] dated Sunday, 3 May 1818.&lt;blockquote&gt;

: I compare human life to a large Mansion of Many Apartments, two of which I can only describe, the doors of the rest being as yet shut upon me - The first we step into we call the infant or thoughtless Chamber, in which we remain as long as we do not think - We remain there a long while, and notwithstanding the doors of the second Chamber remain wide open, showing a bright appearance, we care not to hasten to it; but are at length imperceptibly impelled by awakening of the thinking principle - within us - we no sooner get into the second Chamber, which I shall call the Chamber of Maiden-Thought, than we become intoxicated with the light and the atmosphere, we see nothing but pleasant wonders, and think of delaying there for ever in delight: However among the effects this breathing is father of is that tremendous one of sharpening one's vision into the nature and heart of Man — of convincing one's nerves that the World is full of misery and Heartbreak, Pain, sickness and oppression — whereby This Chamber of Maiden Thought becomes gradually darken'd and at the same time on all sides of it many doors are set open - but all dark - all leading to dark passages — We see not the balance of good and evil. We are in a Mist - We are now in that state — We feel the burden of the Mystery.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://google.com/search?q=cache:F3KC-Gtbg_EJ:englishhistory.net/keats/letters/reynolds3May1818.html+keats+%22mansion+of+many+apartments%22&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk&amp;client=firefox-a John Keats, letter To J H Reynolds, 3 May 1818. see]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colvin, Sidney''John Keats: His Life and Poetry, His Friends, Critics and After-Fame'', Admant Media Corp 2006, p267   {{ISBN|1-113-43548-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here Keats suggests that people were capable of different levels of thought. Those who did not consider the [[world]] around them remained in the thoughtless chamber. Even though the door to move on to the next "[[apartment]]" was open, they had no desire to think any deeper and to go into that next apartment.

When you did move on into the next chamber, you would for the first time have a [[choice]] of direction, as from this apartment there were several different dark passages. Keats believed that he was at this point when he wrote the letter, as was [[William Wordsworth]] when he wrote ''[[Tintern Abbey (poem)|Tintern Abbey]]''.

Keats expressed this idea in [[The Fall of Hyperion: A Dream]] (1819).

A '''mass shooting''' is an incident involving multiple participants of firearms-related violence.

A mass shooting may be committed by individuals or organizations in public or non-public places. [[Terrorist groups]] in recent times have used the tactic of mass shootings to fulfill their political aims. Individuals who commit mass shootings may fall into any of a number of categories, including [[Familicide|killers of family]], of [[Workplace violence|coworkers]], of [[School shooting|students]], and of random strangers. Individuals' motives for shooting vary.

Responses to mass shootings take a variety of forms, depending on the context: number of casualties, the country, political climate, and other factors. The [[News media|media]] cover mass shootings extensively and often sensationally, and the effect of that coverage has been examined. Countries such as the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]] have changed their gun laws in the wake of mass shootings. In contrast, the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|United States' constitution]] prohibits laws which disallow firearm ownership outright and owns about half of the world's guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/world/americas/mass-shootings-us-international.html|title=What Explains U.S. Mass Shootings?

In Australia, a 2006 paper defined a mass shooting as "one in which ⩾5 firearm‐related homicides are committed by one or two perpetrators in proximate events in a civilian setting, not counting any perpetrators".&lt;ref name=PMC&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Chapman|first1=S.|title=Australia's 1996 gun law reforms: faster falls in firearm deaths, firearm suicides, and a decade without mass shootings|pmc=2704353|pmid=17170183|doi=10.1136/ip.2006.013714|volume=12|date=December 2006|pages=365–72|journal=Injury Prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crime violence research group [[Gun Violence Archive]], whose research is used by all major American media outlets defines Mass Shooting as "FOUR or more shot and/or killed in a single event [incident], at the same general time and location not including the shooter" differentiating between Mass Shooting and Mass Murder [Killing] and not counting shooters as victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/methodology|title=General Methodology - Gun Violence Archive|website=www.gunviolencearchive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An act is typically defined as terrorist if it "appears to have been intended" to intimidate or to coerce people;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/03/when-should-a-shooting-really-be-called-terrorism/ |title=When should a shooting really be called ‘terrorism'? |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=3 December 2015|author=Ana Swanson|accessdate= 27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mass shooting is not, in itself, an act of terrorism. A U.S. [[Congressional Research Service]] report explicitly excluded from its definition of public mass shootings those in which the violence is a means to an end, for example where the gunmen "pursue criminal profit or kill in the name of terrorist ideologies".&lt;ref name="CRS"/&gt;

Mass shootings have occurred on the African continent, including the [[2015 Sousse attacks]], the [[2015 Bamako hotel attack]], the 2013 [[Westgate shopping mall attack]] in [[Nairobi, Kenya]], and the 1994 [[Kampala wedding massacre]]. Most mass shootings in Africa have stemmed from [[terrorism]], with tourists and diplomats frequently being the targets. Workplace violence and prejudice against ethnic minorities have less-frequently been involved in such spontaneous acts of mass violence.

===Asia===
Several mass shootings have occurred in Asia, including the 1938 [[Tsuyama massacre]], the 1948 [[Babrra massacre]], the 1983 [[Pashupatinath Temple shooting]], the 1993 [[Chongqing shooting]], and the 1994 [[Tian Mingjian incident]].

====India====
The single deadliest event was the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]] in which 164 people were killed and a further 308 people were wounded by terrorists.

====South Korea====
South Korea has suffered multiple mass shootings in the [[South Korean Army]], mainly due to soldier's stress and conflicts from its violence and detention from society.

====Japan====
Japan has as few as two gun-related homicides per year. These numbers include all homicides in the country, not just mass shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/07/a-land-without-guns-how-japan-has-virtually-eliminated-shooting-deaths/260189/|title=A Land Without Guns: How Japan Has Virtually Eliminated Shooting Deaths|work=The Atlantic|date=July 23, 2012|accessdate=December 16, 2015|first=Max|last=Fisher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when adjusting for different population sizes, analysing data between 2009 and 2015 (therefore excluding shootings like the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting and the 2017 Las Vegas shooting), the US falls to 12th in a comparison between the US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://crimeresearch.org/2015/06/comparing-death-rates-from-mass-public-shootings-in-the-us-and-europe |title= UPDATED: Comparing Death Rates from Mass Public Shootings and Mass Public Violence in the US and Europe |agency= Crime Prevention Research Center |first=John |last=Lott |date= January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study by criminologist Adam Lankford, it was estimated that 31% of public mass shootings occur in the U.S., although it has only 5% of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/4007909/gun-violence-mass-shootings/ Why the U.S. Has 31% of the World's Mass Shootings.] ''TIME.''

==Motives==
Mass shootings can be motivated by [[misanthropy]]&lt;ref&gt;De Freitas, Julian, and Mina Cikara. "Deep down my enemy is good: Thinking about the true self reduces intergroup bias." (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[terrorism]] and caused by [[mental illness]], [[inceldom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rabble.ca/blogs/bloggers/other-hand/2018/02/high-school-students-demand-action-gun-control-following-parkland|title=High school students demand action on gun control following Parkland shooting - rabble.ca|website=rabble.ca|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Brunt, Brian, and W.

Likewise, mass shooting expert and former FBI profiler Mary O'Toole also uses the phrase "injustice collector" in characterizing motives of some mass shooting perpetrators.&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bekiempis|first1=Victoria|title=Meet Mass-Shooting Expert Mary Ellen O'Toole|url=http://www.newsweek.com/serial-killer-mass-shooter-school-shootings-federal-bureau-investigation-367374|date=September 4, 2015|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=September 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation, criminologist [[James Alan Fox]] contends that mass murderers are "enabled by social isolation" and typically experience "years of disappointment and failure that produce a mix of profound hopelessness and deep-seated resentment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=James Alan |last=Fox |date=January 16, 2011 |url= http://www.boston.com/community/blogs/crime_punishment/2011/01/the_real_causes_of_mass_murder.html |title= The real causes of mass murder |work= Boston.com |accessdate= November 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2015/12/03/james-alan-fox-san-bernardino-focus-murderous-partnership/76725342/|title=James Alan Fox: In San Bernardino, focus on the murderous partnership|work=USA Today|date=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jillian Peterson]], an assistant professor of criminology at [[Hamline University]] who is participating in the construction of a database on mass shooters, noted that two phenomena surface repeatedly in the statistics: hopelessness and a need for notoriety in life or in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wanamaker |first=John |date=October 8, 2017|title='This shooter is a little different': Hamline professor studies mass shootings|url=https://www.mprnews.org/story/2017/10/08/this-shooter-is-a-little-different-hamline-professor-studies-mass-shootings|work= [[Minnesota Public Radio|MPR]] News |location= |access-date=October 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Notoriety was first suggested as a possible motive and researched by Justin Nutt.  Nutt stated in a 2013 article, "those who feel nameless and as though no one will care or remember them when they are gone may feel doing something such as a school shooting will make sure they are remembered and listed in the history books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialjusticesolutions.org/2013/12/14/school-shootings-possible-causes/|title=School Shootings and Possible Causes|date=14 December 2013|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In considering the frequency of mass shootings in the United States, criminologist Peter Squires says that the individualistic culture in the United States puts the country at greater risk for mass shootings than other countries, noting that "many other countries where gun ownership is high, such as Norway, Finland, Switzerland and Israel . . . tend to have more tight-knit societies where a strong social bond supports people through crises, and mass killings are fewer." He is an advocate of gun control, but contends there is more to mass shootings than the prevalence of guns.&lt;ref name=europe&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dorell|first1=Oren|title=In Europe, fewer mass killings due to culture not guns|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/12/17/guns-mass-killings-worldwide/1776191/|publisher=USA Today|date=December 18, 2012|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social science and family structure==

According to Michael Cook and Carolyn Moynihan of Mercatornet,&lt;ref name="mercatornet.com"&gt;https://www.mercatornet.com/features/articles/21046/&lt;/ref&gt; an angle that is missed by mainstream media is the findings of important social scientists such as eminent Harvard sociologist [[Robert J. Sampson]] who wrote: “Family structure is one of the strongest, if not the strongest, predictor of variations in urban violence across cities in the United States. The close empirical connection between family breakdown and crime suggests that increased spending on crime-fighting, imprisonment, and criminal justice in the United States over the last 40 years is largely the direct or indirect consequence of marital breakdown.” His views are echoed by the eminent criminologists [[Michael Gottfredson]] and [[Travis Hirschi]], who have written that “such family measures as the percentage of the population divorced, the percentage of households headed by women, and the percentage of unattached individuals in the community are among the most powerful predictors of crime rates.”&lt;ref name="aei.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aei.org/publication/sons-of-divorce-school-shooters/|title=Sons of divorce, school shooters|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the research of another social scientist who was himself raised by a single mother, Bradford Wilcox, "boys living in single mother homes are almost twice as likely to end up delinquent compared to boys who enjoy good relationships with their father."&lt;ref name="aei.org"/&gt;

Moynihan said that "almost all school shooters come from families where the parents are either divorced or alienated",&lt;ref name="mercatornet.com"/&gt; and Cook argued that "perhaps they wouldn’t need more gun control if they had better divorce control.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mercatornet.com/features/view/an-act-of-pure-evil/20506|title=MercatorNet: ‘An act of pure evil’|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News|date=July 27, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, some in law enforcement have decided against naming mass shooting suspects in media-related events to avoid giving them notoriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elinson|first1=Zusha|last2=Lazo|first2=Alejandro|title=More Police Decide Against Naming Mass-Shooting Suspects|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/more-police-decide-against-naming-mass-shooting-suspects-1443985970|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=October 4, 2015|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of messages used in the coverage of mass shootings has been studied. Researchers studied the role the coverage plays in shaping attitudes toward persons with serious mental illness and public support for [[gun control]] policies.&lt;ref name=emma&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=McGinty|first1=Emma|title=Effects of News Media Messages About Mass Shootings on Attitudes Toward Persons With Serious Mental Illness and Public Support for Gun Control Policies|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=170|issue=5|pages=494–501|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13010014|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|accessdate=11 August 2015|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13010014|pmid=23511486|date=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a paper written by a physicist and statistician, [[Sherry Towers]], along with four colleagues was published, which proved that there is indeed mass shooting contagion using [[mathematical modeling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Towers|first1=Sherry|last2=Gomez-Lievano|first2=Andres|last3=Khan|first3=Maryam|last4=Mubayi|first4=Anuj|last5=Castillo-Chavez|first5=Carlos|date=2 July 2015|editor-last=Yukich|editor-first=Joshua|editor-link=Joshua Yukich|title=Contagion in Mass Killings and School Shootings|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0117259|access-date=17 June 2018|journal=[[PLOS ONE]]|publisher=[[Public Library of Science]]|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0117259|layurl=https://www.livescience.com/51429-mass-shootings-are-contagious.html|laysource=Live Science|laydate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in 2017 Towers said in an interview that she prefers [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]] to [[censorship]] to address this issue, just like years ago major news outlets successfully prevent [[copycat suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Towers |first=Sherry |interviewer= John Hook|title= Newsmaker Sunday: Sherry Towers|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sQKZcpolAY |publisher=[[Fox 10 Phoenix]] |location=Phoenix, Arizona, United States |date=6 December 2017|work=Newsmaker Sunday |access-date=14 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the [[American Psychological Association]] published a [[press release]], claiming that mass shooting contagion does exist and news media and social media enthusiasts should withhold the name(s) and face(s) of the victimizer(s) when reporting a mass shooting to deny the fame the shooter(s) want to curb contagion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last= Johnston|first= Jennifer|authorlink=Jennifer Johnston|date= 4 August 2016|title= "Media Contagion" Is Factor in Mass Shootings, Study Says|url=http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2016/08/media-contagion.aspx |location= |publisher= American Psychological Association |access-date=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some news media have weighed in on the gun control debate. After the [[2015 San Bernardino attack]], the ''[[New York Daily News]]''{{'}} front-page headline, "God isn't fixing this", was accompanied by "images of tweets from leading Republicans who shared their [[thoughts and prayers|'thoughts' and 'prayers']] for the shooting victims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/daily-news-cover-san-bernardino-shooting-2015-12|title=Hard-hitting Daily News cover blasts Republicans for offering only 'prayers' after latest shooting|author=Colin Campbell|publisher=Business Insider|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Marina|last=Fang|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-daily-news-cover_565fa492e4b08e945fee15ce|title=New York Daily News Skewers Politicians Refusing to Act on Gun Violence: 'God Isn't Fixing This'|work=Huffington Post|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[2014 Isla Vista killings]], satirical news website ''[[The Onion]]'' has republished the story "'No Way To Prevent This', Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens" with minor edits after major mass shootings, to satirise the popular consensus that there is a lack of political power in the United States to prevent mass shootings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2017/10/03/why-this-onion-article-goes-viral-after-every-mass-shooting/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gun law reform===
{{See also|Overview of gun laws by nation}}
Responses to mass shootings take a variety of forms, depending on the country and political climate.

====Australia====
After the 1996 [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]] in [[Australia]], the government changed [[Gun laws in Australia#The Port Arthur massacre and its consequences|gun laws in Australia]]. As in the United States, figures vary according to the definition of "mass shooting"; a 2006 paper used a definition "one in which ⩾5 firearm‐related homicides are committed by one or two perpetrators in proximate events in a civilian setting, not counting any perpetrators",&lt;ref name=PMC/&gt; compared to the usual U.S. definition of an indiscriminate rampage in public places resulting in four or more victims killed. Between 1981 and the passing of the law in 1996 there were 13 mass shootings with five or more deaths; in the following decade, while the new law was in place, there were no such mass shootings.&lt;ref name=PMC/&gt; Overall gun deaths have continued to decline for two decades since the law was passed,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dewan|first1=Angela|last2=Tarabay|first2=Jamie|title=What the UK and Australia did differently after mass shootings|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/04/world/gun-control-uk-australia/index.html|accessdate=31 January 2018|publisher=CNN|date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, however there have been several shootings with three or more deaths since 1996 where the victims were related to the shooter.

There were five significant shootings, though not meeting the "mass shooting" definition of the 2006 paper, between 1996 {{As of|2016|6|alt=and June 2018}}:
* the [[Monash University shooting]] in 2002 in which Huan Yun Xiang shot and killed two and injured five
* the [[2011 Hectorville siege|Hectorville Siege]] in 2011 where 39-year-old man Donato Anthony Corbo shot four people on a neighbouring property (three of whom died), and also wounded two police officers, before being arrested by Special Operations police after an eight-hour siege
* the Logan family shooting in 2014 of a neighbour family (Greg Holmes, 48, his mother Mary Lockhart, 75, and her husband Peter Lockhart, 78) by Ian Francis Jamieson
* the Hunt family murders, in October 2014 when Geoff Hunt murdered four relatives before killing himself
* The Osmington shooting in May 2018, involving the death of 7 when a grandfather shot and killed his four grandchildren, his daughter, his wife and then himself.

====United Kingdom====
As a result of the 1987 [[Hungerford massacre]] and 1996 [[Dunblane school massacre]] mass shootings, the [[United Kingdom]] enacted tough gun laws and a buyback program to remove guns from private ownership.&lt;ref name=hart&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hartmann|first1=Margaret|title=How Australia and Britain Tackled Gun Violence|url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/10/how-australia-and-britain-tackled-gun-violence.html#|publisher=Daily Intelligencer|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been two mass shootings since the laws were restricted, the [[Cumbria shootings]] in 2010 which killed 13 people&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and the [[Moss Side mass shooting]] in 2018, in which no-one was killed.

====United States====
{{See also|Gun law in the United States|Gun laws in the United States by state|Gun politics in the United States}}
In the [[United States]], support for gun law reform [[gun politics in the United States|varies considerably by political party]], with Democrats generally more supportive and Republicans generally more opposed. Some in the U.S. believe that tightening gun laws would prevent future mass shootings.&lt;ref name=progress&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collins|first1=Sam|title=One Change To Our Gun Laws That Could Have Prevented The Last Mass Shooting|url=http://thinkprogress.org/health/2015/07/28/3685169/gun-laws-mental-health-lafayette/|publisher=Think Progress|date=July 28, 2015|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some politicians in the U.S. introduced legislation to reform the background check system for purchasing a gun.&lt;ref name=ali&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinberg|first1=Ali|title=These 6 Stalled Bills Aimed at Mass Shootings Like Umpqua Flounder in Congress|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/stalled-bills-aimed-mass-shootings-umpqua-flounder-congress/story?id=34208798|publisher=ABC News|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vast majority of Americans support tighter background checks. "According to a poll [Made by CNN] by Quinnipiac University in Connecticut, 93 percent of registered voters said they would support universal background checks for all gun buyers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2015/10/americans-support-universal-background-checks|title=An Overwhelming Majority of Americans Still Support Universal Background Checks|work=Mother Jones|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015|first=Becca|last=Andrews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others contend that mass shootings should not be the main focus in the gun law reform debate because these shootings account for less than one percent of the U.S. homicide rate and believe that these shootings are hard to stop. They often argue that civilians with concealed guns will be able to stop shootings.&lt;ref name=volokh&gt;{{cite web|last1=Volokh|first1=Eugene|title=Do civilians with guns ever stop mass shootings?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/10/03/do-civilians-with-guns-ever-stop-mass-shootings/|publisher=Washington Post|date=October 3, 2015|accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gun control policies may cause a lot of controversy due to divided opinions on who should be able to carry a weapon.  An opinion survey was conducted by the firm GfK Knowledge Networks to differentiate between the different attitudes towards gun control. There was a gun policy survey and a mental illness survey. Studies showed that over 85% of those questioned supported national background checks into the mental health records of citizens attempting to purchase a gun. More than 50% of people felt that those suffering with mental health issues were more deviant and threatening than those who had good mental health. The study also proved that there is large interest in contributing to mental health awareness as well as simply prohibiting those suffering from purchasing guns. Nearly two thirds of respondents supported greater government spending on mental health, with more than 60% of people believing this would reduce gun violence in the USA. (Colleen L. Barry, 2013)

===Leaders===
As of June 2016, U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] had spoken in the aftermath of fourteen mass shootings during his nearly eight-year presidency, repeatedly calling for more gun safety laws in the United States.&lt;ref name=korte&gt;{{cite web|last1=Korte|first1=Gregory|title=11 mass shootings, 11 speeches: How Obama has responded|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/10/02/11-mass-shootings-11-speeches-how-obama-has-responded/73177526/|publisher=USA Today|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Charleston church shooting]], U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] said, "At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn't happen in other places with this kind of frequency."&lt;ref name=benen&gt;{{cite web|last1=Benen|first1=Steve|title=Comparing U.S. mass shootings to the rest of the world|url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/comparing-us-mass-shootings-the-rest-the-world|publisher=MSNBC|date=June 23, 2015|accessdate=August 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the December [[2015 San Bernardino attack]], Obama renewed his call for reforming gun-safety laws and also said that the frequency of mass shootings in the United States has "no parallel in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/obama-san-bernardino-shooting-2015-12|title=OBAMA: 'We have a pattern now of mass shootings ... that has no parallel'|work=Business Insider|date=December 2, 2015|accessdate=December 16, 2015|first=Maxwell|last=Tani}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the February 2018 attack at Florida's [[Parkland school shooting]] at [[Stoneman Douglas High School]], the school's student survivors, teachers, and parents became strong leaders in the effort to ban [[assault weapon]] sales and easy accessibility to [[military weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Witt|first1=Emily|title=How the Survivors of Parkland Began the Never Again Movement|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-the-survivors-of-parkland-began-the-never-again-movement?CNDID=30462369&amp;spMailingID=12971483&amp;spUserID=MTMzMTgzMTA1MjA0S0&amp;spJobID=1341843325&amp;spReportId=MTM0MTg0MzMyNQS2|website=The New Yorker|accessdate=20 February 2018|language=en|date=19 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India's '''National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business (NVGs)'''&lt;ref name="NVG"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/latestnews/National_Voluntary_Guidelines_2011_12jul2011.pdf|title= National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business (NVGs)|publisher=Ministry of Corporate Affairs|year=2011|accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; were released by the [[Ministry of Corporate Affairs (India)|Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mca.gov.in/ |title=Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India |publisher=mca.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in July 2011 by Mr. Murli Deora, the former Honourable Minister for Corporate Affairs. The national framework on Business Responsibility is essentially a set of nine principles that offer businesses an Indian understanding and approach to inculcating '''responsible business''' conduct.

“Responsible Business” conduct refers to the commitment of businesses to operating in an economically, socially and environmentally sustainable manner while balancing the demands of shareholders and other interest groups. It’s about managing risks and impacts, which affect business’ ability to meet its objectives. The NVGs are formulated with the objective of creating positive framework conditions to advance the role of business in economic growth which is socially and environmentally sustainable, while also ensuring enhanced competitiveness and integration into the global markets.

The NVGs serves as a guidance document for businesses of all size, ownership, sector, and geography to achieve the [[triple bottom line]]. In 2012, subsequent to the release of the NVGs the [[Securities and Exchange Board of India| Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI)]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sebi.gov.in/sebiweb/ |title=Securities and Exchange Board of India |publisher=sebi.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; a market regulator, mandated the Annual Business Responsibility Reporting (ABRR), a reporting framework based on the NVGs.

The NVGs are unique, not just in what they represent, which is “an India specific comprehensive understanding of business responsibility”, but also in the way they have been formulated. The “process” was premised on widespread intensive stakeholder consultations to bring out the commonly agreed elements of business responsibility in keeping with India’s unique developmental challenges and priorities.

==Background==

{{Empty section|date=May 2014}}

==Drafting process==

The NVGs are the revised version of the CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) Voluntary Guidelines 2009, released in December, 2009 by the Honourable President of India, Smt. Pratibha Patil at the India Corporate Week organised by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). The CSR Voluntary Guidelines served as a statement of intent by the Government of India to encourage businesses to adopt responsible business practices. The CSR Guidelines provided for review and elaboration which was undertaken by the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs, a think-tank and capacity development institution set up by the MCA.

The Guidelines Drafting Committee (GDC), appointed by the MCA in 2009, started its work on the new mandate for review and elaboration of the 2009 Guidelines. The process was completed in October 2010 and the final draft was presented to the MCA on 3 November 2010. The revised guidelines were the National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business. Stakeholders consulted during the period recommended that since the Guidelines look at a comprehensive framework of responsible business action the title of the Guideline must depict the understanding and hence they were called the NVGs. These were released by the MCA on 8 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=73107 |title=National Voluntary Guidelines on Social, Environmental &amp; Economic Responsibilities of Business Released - Press Information Bureau, Government of India - Press Release |publisher=pib.nic.in |date=2011-07-08 |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drafting committee ===
The GDC comprised experts and practitioners from diverse stakeholder groups such as industry associations, regulatory bodies, sector experts, government, financial institutions, etc. It consisted of eleven members who were supported by an anchor team. The drafting process involved extensive consultations, conducted across cities and regions in India: Bangalore (South), New Delhi (North), Kolkata (East) and Mumbai (West). In addition to consultations, written feedback was also solicited. The Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs (IICA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iica.in/ |title=Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs - Partners in Knowledge, Governance, Transformation |publisher=Iica.in |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india-briefing.com/news/india-releases-voluntary-national-responsibility-guidelines-4925.html/ |title=India Releases Voluntary National Responsibility Guidelines - India Briefing News |publisher=India-briefing.com |date=2011-07-21 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; led the entire process. It worked towards developing a consensus on various ideas and perspectives that emerged from various stakeholder groups. The Guidelines were also published on the MCA website for public comments.

The brief before the GDC was to develop these guidelines to provide a distinctively 'Indian'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://india.carbon-outlook.com/content/national-voluntary-guidelines-india-inc-csr-responsible-business |title=National Voluntary Guidelines for India Inc.: from CSR to Responsible Business &amp;#124; India Carbon Outlook &amp;#124; Tracking Actions Towards a Low Carbon Economy |publisher=India Carbon Outlook |date=2011-05-19 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  approach on business responsibility (BR), which is also aligned with international norms and frameworks.

== Business responsibility ==

Since the 1990s, liberalisation and deregulation have boosted the development of the private sector making it the forerunner of economic growth. Frenetic expansion and growth of the private sector has also therefore thrown up challenges necessitating proactive action towards making it sustainable and equitable. Encouraged by the Prime Minister’s ten Point Charter, the MCA, in the recent past, has sharpened its focus on encouraging businesses to play a proactive role in ensuring sustainable and inclusive growth.

While Indian business traditionally stuck to corporate philanthropy, today business leaders understand that practicing responsible business is of strategic importance to their growth, longevity and competitiveness. The NVGs are an embodiment of an integrated and comprehensive understanding of responsible business. The Guidelines encourage and enable businesses to go beyond compliance and embrace sustainability as part of their business ethos. The nine principles and the corresponding indicators encompass all the elements of what constitutes responsible business conduct. It also delineates the fundamentals of implementing the NVGs.

These are:

#Leadership: the commitment and role of leadership, 
#Integration: the weaving in of the principles and core elements into the very DNA of the business, 
#Engagement: continuous engagement with relevant stakeholders,
#Reporting: measuring the impact of business activities on all the nine principles and communicating these to their  stakeholders.

==Corporate social responsibility in India==

Traditionally, [[Corporate Social Responsibility|Corporate Social Responsility (CSR)]] has been widely practiced by Indian corporates - taking the form of philanthropic activities. The new CSR legislation under section 135 of the [[Companies Act, 2013|Companies Act 2013]] requires companies of a certain size to spend 2% of their net profit &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/08/13/companies-bill-csr-idINDEE97C02Q20130813 |title=Companies bill would require firms to spend 2 percent profits on poor |publisher=reuters.com |date=2013-08-13 |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; on activities as prescribed under schedule VII, which are primarily aimed at community development. The canvas of CSR remains narrow and de-linked from the core-business activities of a company. However, the more progressive businesses view the legislation as opportunity to address the developmental challenges of India through sustainable innovations and creation of shared value. Principle 8 of the NVGs expounds on this very concept, while also acknowledging the need for community development as articulated under the new CSR law. Principle 8 of the NVGs on “inclusive and equitable growth” focuses on encouraging business action on national development priorities, including community development initiatives and strategic CSR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greencleanguide.com/2011/10/02/csr-voluntary-guidelines/ |title=CSR Voluntary Guidelines by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India &amp;#124; For the Changing Planet |publisher=Greencleanguide.com |date=2011-10-02 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the shared value concept.

==Principles on responsible business==

The NVGs are an aspirational and comprehensive guideline to encourage responsible business behaviour in India. The NVGs, a set of 9 principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.sustainabilityoutlook.in/content/library/national-voluntary-guidelines-social-environmental-and-economic-responsibilities-bus |title=National Voluntary Guidelines for the Social, Environmental and Economic Responsibilities of Business (NVG-SEE) 2011 |publisher=sustainabilityoutlook.in |date=2012-01-24 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; cover a broad array of social, economic, environmental and governance issues and developmental priorities. To actualise the principles a corresponding set of core elements have also been developed. The NVGs also offer guidance on implementation, through its four integral actions – leadership, integration, engagement and reporting. The annexes articulate the business case for adopting the NVGs, existing legislation relevant to the various principles and a set of resources. A special section has been dedicated on the applicability of the principles for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs), to ensure inclusivity irrespective of scale.

=== The nine principles ===
[[File:The NVG Package.png|thumbnail|right|The NVG Package]]

:: '''Principle 1:''' ''Businesses should conduct and govern themselves with ethics, transparency and accountability
:: '''Principle 2:''' ''Businesses should provide goods and services that are safe and contribute to sustainability throughout their life cycle
:: '''Principle 3:''' ''Businesses should promote the wellbeing of all employees
:: '''Principle 4:''' ''Businesses should respect the interests of, and be responsive towards all stakeholders, especially those who are disadvantaged, vulnerable and marginalised
:: '''Principle 5:''' ''Businesses should respect and promote human rights
:: '''Principle 6:''' ''Businesses should respect, protect, and make efforts to restore the environment
:: '''Principle 7:''' ''Businesses, when engaged in influencing public and regulatory policy, should do so in a responsible manner
:: '''Principle 8:''' ''Businesses should support inclusive growth and equitable development
:: '''Principle 9:''' ''Businesses should engage with and provide value to their customers and consumers in a responsible manner

==Adopting the guidelines==

The NVGs help Indian businesses at multiple levels. They enable businesses to create value, encourage healthy labour practices, minimise operational risks, attract and retain customers, motivate investments and financial markets and stimulate growth. Overall, the NVGs enable companies to leave a positive footprint on the environment and society while remaining competitive. The private sector is the economic engine of India. Poverty alleviation, job-creation, innovation at grassroots, protection of scarce resources are not only impacts of sustainable businesses but cater to nation building. With globalisation and a varied range of stakeholders demanding answers, responsible business action is gaining traction.

While the business case was considered to be the biggest motivation for adoption of the guidelines, the guidelines also underscore the importance of ‘values/ethics’ in business conduct as a driver to pursue sustainable management practices as a means to reaching sustainable development goals.

== Annual Business Responsibility Report ==

Following the release of the NVGs, the MCA reconstituted the GDC as the Disclosures Framework Committee with two additional members and tasked it with develop a disclosure framework based on the NVGs. The disclosure framework, 'Annual Business Responsibility Report' (ABRR), was formulated by the Disclosure Framework Committee to ensure wider evidence based uptake of the NVGs. The ABRR is a reporting format that requires principle-wise (NVGs) disclosure by businesses. This reporting framework helps Indian companies implement the NVGs and communicate the same to its stakeholders. It is designed on an ‘Apply or Explain’ methodology and aims at assisting companies to re-examine their processes and align them with the ethos of the NVGs.

The ‘Apply-or-Explain’ principle is an enabling measure that encourages companies to do three things:
#Disclose the current status of sustainability driven performance at whatever stage that may be.
#Disclose reasons for non-adoption of any of the principles, which may include non-applicability as per their understanding, or future plans of implementation.
#Ideally undertake a process of review to identify and manage sustainability gaps and risks in line with the future outlook of the company.

The ABRR reports can be accessed on the website of the National Stock Exchange and the Bombay Stock Exchange. The 100 companies that report are currently the top listed companies based on market capitalization at BSE and NSE. 98 companies have filed their Business Responsibility Reports (BRRs) on the websites of the National and Bombay Stock Exchanges. A linkage document was also developed and launched internationally at the GRI ([[Global Reporting Initiative]]) Conference on Sustainability in Amsterdam 2013.  The document serves as a tool for businesses to map their performance against the NVGs, ABRR and GRI G3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalreporting.org/network/regional-networks/gri-focal-points/focal-point-india/Pages/default.aspx |title=GRI Focal Point India |publisher=globalreporting.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csridentity.com/india/gri.asp |title=GRI in India |publisher=csridentity.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Securities and Exchange Board Of India directive==

The Guidelines were released by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India on 8 July 2011. Soon after, on 24 November 2011, a Board resolution was passed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), wherein they mandated the top 100 listed companies to report on their Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) performance through a Business Responsibility Report (BRR),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/sebi-asks-for-business-responsibility-reports/ |title=Sebi asks for business responsibility reports |publisher=The Indian Express |date=2012-08-15 |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}&lt;ref name="SEBI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ckinetics.com/publications/Preparedness_of_India_inc_for_NVG.pdf |title=Preparedness of Indian Public Equities for Business Sustainability (Environmental, Social and Governance) Disclosure and Reporting |publisher=Ckinetics.com |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-09-14/news/33844340_1_business-responsibility-annual-reports-national-voluntary-guidelines |title=Thanks to SEBI, shareholders will have access to critical information from the next fiscal - Economic Times |publisher=Articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would then form a part of their annual report/filings.

==Future plans==
SEBI encourages all companies to adopt the ABRR.

'''Negligence''' (Lat. ''negligentia'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negligence|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/negligence|website=Oxford Living Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a failure to exercise appropriate and or ethical ruled care expected to be exercised amongst specified circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Negligence|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/negligence|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of [[tort]] law known as ''negligence'' involves harm caused by failing to act as a form of ''carelessness'' possibly with extenuating circumstances. The core concept of negligence is that people should exercise reasonable care in their actions, by taking account of the potential harm that they might foreseeably cause to other people or property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Feinman|first=Jay|title=Law 101|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539513-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone who suffers loss caused by another's negligence may be able to sue for [[damages]] to compensate for their harm. Such loss may include physical injury, harm to property, psychiatric illness, or economic loss. The law on negligence may be assessed in general terms according to a five-part model which includes the assessment of duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause, and damages.&lt;ref&gt;Deakin, Tort Law, 218&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of negligence claims==
Some things must be established by anyone who wants to sue in negligence. These are what are called the [[Element (criminal law)|"elements"]] of negligence.

Most jurisdictions say that there are four elements to a negligence action:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehm|first1=Theodore R.|title=A Tangled Webb - Reexamining the Role of Duty in Indiana Negligence Actions|journal=Indiana Law Review|date=2003|volume=37|issue=1|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/indilr37&amp;div=8&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#duty: the [[defendant]] has a duty to others, including the [[plaintiff]], to exercise reasonable care,
#breach: the defendant breaches that duty through an act or culpable omission,
#damages: as a result of that act or omission, the plaintiff suffers an injury, and
#causation: the injury to the plaintiff is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant's act or omission.

Some jurisdictions narrow the definition down to three elements: duty, breach and proximately caused harm.&lt;ref name="owen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owen|first1=David G.|title=The Five Elements of Negligence|journal=Hofstra Law Review|date=Summer 2007|volume=35|issue=4|page=1671|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2282&amp;context=hlr|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions recognize five elements, duty, breach, actual cause, proximate cause, and damages.&lt;ref name="owen"/&gt; However, at their heart, the various definitions of what constitutes negligent conduct are very similar.

===Duty of care===
{{Main|Duty of care}}
[[Image:Grapevinesnail 01.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A decomposed snail in Scotland was the humble beginning of the modern English law of negligence]]

The legal liability of a defendant to a plaintiff is based on the defendant's failure to fulfil a responsibility, recognised by law, of which the plaintiff is the intended beneficiary. The first step in determining the existence of a legally recognised responsibility is the concept of an obligation or duty. In the tort of negligence the term used is duty of care &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Torts In Ireland|last=Quill|first=Eoin|publisher=Gill &amp; Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=|location=Dublin 12|pages=19|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case of ''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Donoghue v Stevenson]]'' [1932] AC 532&lt;/ref&gt; [1932] established the modern law of negligence, laying the foundations of the duty of care and the [[fault (legal)|fault]] principle which, (through the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]]), have been adopted throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. May Donoghue and her friend were in a café in Paisley. The friend bought Mrs Donoghue a [[Ice cream float|ginger beer float]].  She drank some of the beer and later poured the remainder over her ice-cream and was horrified to see the decomposed remains of a snail exit the bottle. Donoghue suffered nervous shock and gastro-enteritis, but did not sue the cafe owner, instead suing the manufacturer, Stevenson. (As Mrs Donoghue had not herself bought the ginger beer, the doctrine of [[privity]] precluded a [[law of contract|contractual]] action against Stevenson).

The Scottish judge, Lord MacMillan, considered the case to fall within a new category of delict (the Scots law nearest equivalent of tort). The case proceeded to the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]], where [[Lord Atkin]] interpreted the biblical ordinance to 'love thy neighbour' as a legal requirement to 'not harm thy neighbour.' He then went on to define neighbour as "persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions that are called in question."

In England the more recent case of ''[[Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman]]'' [1990] introduced a 'threefold test' for a duty of care. Harm must be (1) reasonably foreseeable (2) there must be a relationship of proximity between the plaintiff and defendant and (3) it must be 'fair, just and reasonable' to impose liability. However, these act as guidelines for the courts in establishing a duty of care; much of the principle is still at the discretion of judges.

In Australia, ''Donoghue v Stevenson'' was used as a persuasive precedent in the case of ''[[Grant v Australian Knitting Mills]]'' (AKR) (1936).&lt;ref name=PC&gt;{{Cite Bailii|litigants=[[Grant v Australian Knitting Mills]] |year=1935 |court=UKPC |num=62 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1936] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 85}}; {{cite AustLII|UKPCHCA|1|1935|parallelcite= (1935) 54 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 49 |date=21 October 1935 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a landmark case in the development of negligence law in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law.uwa.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/1838186/Example_Development-of-law-negligence.pdf |title=Example of the Development of the Law of Negligence |website=law.uwa.edu.au}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a duty of care is owed for psychiatric, as opposed to physical, harm was discussed in the Australian case of ''Tame v State of New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd'' (2002).&lt;ref name="Tame HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|35|2002|litigants=Tame v State of New South Wales; Annetts v Australian Stations Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(2002) 211 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 317 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jaensch v Coffey"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|52|1984|litigants=[[Jaensch v Coffey]] |parallelcite=(1984) 155 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 549 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Determining a duty for mental harm has now been subsumed into the ''Civil Liability Act 2002'' in New South Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|cla2002161|Civil Liability Act 2002|32}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The application of Part 3 of the ''Civil Liability Act 2002'' (NSW) was demonstrated in ''Wicks v SRA (NSW); Sheehan v SRA (NSW)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|22|2010|litigants=Wicks v State Rail Authority of New South Wales; Sheehan v State Rail Authority of New South Wales |parallelcite=(2010) 241 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 60 |courtname=auto |date=}};&lt;br&gt;see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|15|2005|litigants=Koehler v Cerebos (Australia) Ltd |parallelcite=(2005) 222 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 44 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breach of duty===
{{See also|Breach of duty in English law}}
[[Image:Cricket Scene Sarhad..jpg|thumb|150px|right|In ''Bolton v Stone'', the English [[Lords of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lords]] were sympathetic to cricket players]]
Once it is established that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff/claimant, the matter of whether or not that duty was breached must be settled.  The test is both subjective and objective.  The defendant who knowingly (subjective,Which is totally based on observation and personal prejudice or view) exposes the plaintiff/claimant to a substantial risk of loss, breaches that duty.  The defendant who fails to realize the substantial risk of loss to the plaintiff/claimant, which any [[reasonable person]] [objective,Which is totally based on ground facts and reality without any personal prejudice or point of view.] in the same situation would clearly have realized, also breaches that duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1980|litigants=Wyong Shire Council v Shirt |parallelcite=(1980) 146 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 40 |courtname=auto |date=1 May 1980}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|151|2005|litigants=Doubleday v Kelly |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}; see also {{cite AustLII|NSWCA|222|2006|litigants=Drinkwater v Howart |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whether the test is objective or subjective may depend upon the particular case involved.

There is a reduced threshold for the standard of care owed by children. In the Australian case of McHale v Watson,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AustLII|HCA|13|1966|litigants=McHale  v Watson |date=7 March 1966 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; McHale, a 9-year-old girl was blinded in one eye after being hit by the ricochet of a sharp metal rod thrown by a 12-year-old boy, Watson. The defendant child was held not to have the level of care to the standard of an adult, but of a  12-year-old child with similar experience and intelligence. Kitto J explained that a child's lack of foresight is a characteristic they share with others at that stage of development.

Certain jurisdictions, also provide for breaches where professionals, such as doctors, fail to warn of risks associated with medical treatments or procedures. Doctors owe both objective and subjective duties to warn; and breach of either is sufficient to satisfy this element in a court of law. For example, the Civil Liability Act in Queensland outlines a statutory test incorporating both objective and subjective elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Qld|act|cla2003161|Civil Liability Act 2003|21}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an obstetrician who fails to warn a mother of complications arising from childbirth may be held to have breached their professional duty of care.

In ''Donoghue v Stevenson'', Lord Atkin declared that "the categories of negligence are never closed"; and in ''[[Dorset Yacht Co Ltd v Home Office|Dorset Yacht v Home Office]]'' it was held that the government had no immunity from suit when they negligently failed to prevent the escape of juvenile offenders who subsequently vandalise a boatyard.  In other words, all members of society have a duty to exercise reasonable care toward others and their property.  In ''[[Bolton v. Stone]]'' (1951),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Bolton v. Stone]],'' [1951] A.C. 850 see also {{cite AustLII|HCA|42|2007|litigants=Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] held that a defendant was not negligent if the damage to the plaintiff were not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of his conduct. In the case, a Miss Stone was struck on the head by a cricket ball while standing outside a cricket ground. Finding that no batsman would normally be able hit a cricket ball far enough to reach a person standing as far away as was Miss Stone, the court held her claim would fail because the danger was not reasonably or sufficiently foreseeable. As stated in the opinion, 'reasonable risk' cannot be judged with the benefit of hindsight.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}  In ''[[Roe v Minister of Health]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''[[Roe v Minister of Health]]'' (1954) 2 AER 131; see also ''Glasgow Corporation v Muir'' (1943) 2 AER 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Denning said the past should not be viewed through rose coloured spectacles, finding no negligence on the part of medical professionals accused of using contaminated medical jars, since contemporary standards would have indicated only a low possibility of medical jar contamination.

===Causation===
{{Main|Causation (law)}}

In order for liability to result from a negligent act or omission, it is necessary to prove not only that the injury was caused by that negligence, but also that there is a legally sufficient connection between the act and the negligence.

====Factual causation (actual cause)====
{{See also|Causation in English law|Breaking the chain}}

For a defendant to be held [[Legal liability|liable]], it must be shown that the particular acts or omissions were the cause of the loss or damage sustained.&lt;ref name="Tubemakers of Australia Ltd v Fernandez"&gt;''Tubemakers of Australia Ltd v Fernandez'' (1976) 10 [[Australian Law Reports|ALR]] 303; (1976) 50 [[Australian Law Journal Reports|ALJR]] 720 [http://www.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/LawCite?cit=10+alr+303 LawCite records].&lt;/ref&gt; Although the notion sounds simple, the causation between one's breach of duty and the harm that results to another can at times be very complicated. The basic test is to ask whether the injury would have occurred 'but for', or without, the accused party's breach of the duty owed to the injured party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|48|2009|litigants=Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Moubarak; Adeels Palace Pty Ltd v Bou Najem |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}; {{cite AustLII|HCA|5|2012|litigants=Strong v Woolworths |parallelcite=(2012) 246 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 182 |courtname=auto |date=}};&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="March v Stramare"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1991|litigants=March v Stramare (E &amp; MH) Pty Ltd |link=March v Stramare |parallelcite=(1991) 171 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 506 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wallace v Kam"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|19|2013|litigants=Wallace v Kam |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the High Court has held that the 'but for' test is not the exclusive test of causation because it cannot address a situation where there is more than one cause of damage.&lt;ref name="March v Stramare"/&gt; When 'but for' test is not satisfied and the case is an exceptional one, a commonsense test ('Whether and Why' test) will be applied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|NSW|act|cla2002161|Civil Liability Act 2005|5d}}(2).&lt;/ref&gt;
Even more precisely, if a breaching party materially increases the risk of harm to another, then the breaching party can be sued to the value of harm that he caused.

Asbestos litigations which have been ongoing for decades revolve around the issue of causation. Interwoven with the simple idea of a party causing harm to another are issues on [[insurance]] bills and compensations, which sometimes drove compensating companies out of business.

====Legal causation (proximate cause)====
[[Image:Train wreck at Montparnasse 1895.jpg|thumb|150px|Negligence can lead to [[Montparnasse derailment|this sort of collision]]: a train wreck at [[Gare Montparnasse]] in 1895.]]
Sometimes factual causation is distinguished from 'legal causation' to avert the danger of defendants being exposed to, in the words of [[Benjamin Cardozo|Cardozo, J.]], "liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class."&lt;ref&gt;''Ultramares Corp. v. Touche''(1931) 255 N.Y. 170, 174 N.E. 441&lt;/ref&gt; It is said a new question arises of how remote a consequence a person's harm is from another's negligence. We say that one's negligence is 'too remote' (in England) or not a '[[proximate cause]]' (in the U.S.) of another's harm if one would 'never' reasonably foresee it happening. Note that a 'proximate cause' in U.S. terminology (to do with the chain of events between the action and the injury) should not be confused with the 'proximity test' under the English duty of care (to do with closeness of relationship). The idea of legal causation is that if no one can foresee something bad happening, and therefore take care to avoid it, how could anyone be responsible? For instance, in ''[[Palsgraf v. Long Island Rail Road Co.]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Palsgraf v. Long Island Rail Road Co.'' (1928) 162 N.E. 99&lt;/ref&gt; the judge decided that the defendant, a [[railway]], was not liable for an injury suffered by a distant bystander.  The plaintiff, Palsgraf, was hit by coin-operated scale which toppled because of fireworks explosion that fell on her as she waited on a train platform. The scales fell because of a far-away commotion but it was not clear that what type of commotion caused the scale to fall,either it was the explosion's effect or the confused movement of the terrified people. A train [[Conductor (transportation)|conductor]] had run to help a man into a departing train. The man was carrying a package as he jogged to jump in the train door. The package had fireworks in it. The conductor mishandled the passenger or his package, causing the package to fall. The fireworks slipped and exploded on the ground causing shockwaves to travel through the platform.Which became the cause of commotion on platform &amp; As a consequence, the scales fell.&lt;ref&gt;The plaintiff's physical injuries were minor and more likely caused by a stampede of travelers on the platform rather than the concussion of the exploding fireworks.  These details have not, however, stopped the case from becoming the source of extensive debate in [[United States|American]] tort law.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Palsgraf was hurt by the falling scales, she sued the [[train]] company who employed the conductor for negligence.&lt;ref&gt;She could have sued the man or the conductor himself, but they did not have as much money as the company. Often, in litigation, where two defendants are equally liable but one is more able to satisfy a judgment, he will be the preferred defendant and is referred to as the "deep pocket."&lt;/ref&gt;

The defendant train company argued it should not be liable as a matter of law, because despite the fact that they employed the employee, who was negligent, his negligence was too remote from the plaintiff's injury. On appeal, the majority of the court agreed, with four judges adopting the reasons, written by Judge Cardozo, that the defendant owed no duty of care to the plaintiff, because a duty was owed only to foreseeable plaintiffs. Three judges dissented, arguing, as written by Judge Andrews, that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff, regardless of foreseeability, because all men owe one another a duty not to act negligently.

Such disparity of views on the element of remoteness continues to trouble the judiciary. Courts that follow Cardozo's view have greater control in negligence cases. If the court can find that, as a matter of law, the defendant owed no duty of care to the plaintiff, the plaintiff will lose his case for negligence before having a chance to present to the jury. Cardozo's view is the majority view. However, some courts follow the position put forth by Judge Andrews. In jurisdictions following the minority rule, defendants must phrase their remoteness arguments in terms of proximate cause if they wish the court to take the case away from the jury.

Remoteness takes another form, seen in ''[[The Wagon Mound (No. 2)]]''.&lt;ref name= "Wagon Mound #2 PC"&gt;{{cite bailii|litigants=[[Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v The Miller Steamship Co]] (Wagon Mound No. 2) |year=1966 |court=UKPC |num=10 |format=1 |parallelcite=[1967] [[Appeal Cases Law Reports|AC]] 617; [1967] 2 [[All England Law Reports|All ER]] 709 |courtname=auto |juris=NSW |date=25 May 1966}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Wagon Mound was a ship in [[Sydney]] harbour. The ship leaked oil creating a slick in part of the harbour.  The wharf owner asked the ship owner about the danger and was told he could continue his work because the slick would not burn.  The wharf owner allowed work to continue on the wharf, which sent sparks onto a rag in the water which ignited and created a fire which burnt down the wharf. The Privy Council determined that the wharf owner 'intervened' in the causal chain, creating a responsibility for the fire which canceled out the liability of the ship owner.

In Australia the concept of remoteness, or proximity, was tested with the case of ''Jaensch v Coffey''.&lt;ref name="Jaensch v Coffey"/&gt; The wife of a policeman, Mrs Coffey suffered a nervous shock injury from the aftermath of a motor vehicle collision although she was not actually at the scene at the time of the collision. The court upheld that, in addition to it being reasonably foreseeable that his wife might suffer such an injury, it required that there be sufficient proximity between the plaintiff and the defendant who caused the collision. Here there was sufficient causal proximity. See also ''Kavanagh v Akhtar'',&lt;ref name="Kavanagh v Akhtar"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWSC|779|1998|litigants=Kavanagh v Akhtar |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Imbree v McNeilly'',&lt;ref name="Imbree v McNeilly"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|2008|litigants=Imbree v McNeilly |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Tame v NSW''.&lt;ref name="Tame HCA"/&gt;

===Injury===
Even though there is breach of duty, and the cause of some injury to the defendant, a plaintiff may not recover unless he can prove that the defendant's breach caused a pecuniary injury. This should not be mistaken with the requirements that a plaintiff prove harm to recover. As a general rule, a plaintiff can only rely on a legal remedy to the point that he proves that he suffered a loss; it was reasonably foreseeable. It means something more than pecuniary loss is a necessary element of the plaintiff's case in negligence. When damages are not a necessary element, a plaintiff can win his case without showing that he suffered any loss; he would be entitled to [[nominal damages]] and any other damages according to proof. (See ''[[Constantine v Imperial Hotels Ltd]]'' [1944] KB]).

Negligence is different in that the plaintiff must prove his loss, and a particular kind of loss, to recover. In some cases, a defendant may not dispute the loss, but the requirement is significant in cases where a defendant cannot deny his negligence, but the plaintiff suffered no pecuniary loss as a result even though he had suffered emotional injury or damage but he cannot be compensated for these kind of losses.The plaintiff can be compensated for emotional or non-pecuniary losses on the condition that If the plaintiff can prove pecuniary loss, then he can also obtain damages for non-pecuniary injuries, such as emotional distress.

The requirement of pecuniary loss can be shown in a number of ways. A plaintiff who is physically injured by allegedly negligent conduct may show that he had to pay a medical bill. If his property is damaged, he could show the income lost because he could not use it, the cost to repair it, although he could only recover for one of these things.

The damage may be physical, purely economic, both physical and economic (loss of earnings following a personal injury,&lt;ref&gt;See, eg, {{cite AustLII|HCA|8|1977|litigants=Sharman v Evans |parallelcite=(1977) 138 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 563 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) or reputational (in a [[defamation]] case).

In English law, the right to claim for purely [[economic loss]] is limited to a number of 'special' and clearly defined circumstances, often related to the nature of the duty to the plaintiff as between clients and lawyers, financial advisers, and other professions where money is central to the consultative services.

[[Negligent infliction of emotional distress|Emotional distress]] has been recognized as an actionable tort. Generally, emotional distress damages had to be parasitic. That is, the plaintiff could recover for emotional distress caused by injury, but only if it accompanied a physical or pecuniary injury.

A claimant who has suffered only emotional distress and no pecuniary loss would not recover for negligence. However, courts have recently allowed recovery for a plaintiff to recover for purely emotional distress under certain circumstances. The state courts of [[California]] allowed recovery for emotional distress alone{{spaced ndash}}even in the absence of any physical injury, when the defendant physically injures a relative of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff witnesses it.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Dillon v. Legg]]'', 68 Cal. 2d 728 (1968) and ''[[Molien]] v. [[Kaiser Foundation|Kaiser Foundation Hospitals]]'', 27 Cal. 3d 916 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

The eggshell skull rule is a legal doctrine upheld in some tort law systems, which holds that a tortfeasor is liable for the full extent of damage caused, even where the extent of the damage is due to the unforeseen frailty of the claimant. The eggshell skull rule was recently maintained in Australia in the case of ''Kavanagh v Akhtar''.&lt;ref name="Kavanagh v Akhtar"/&gt;

==Damages==
{{Main|Damages}}
Damages place a monetary value on the harm done, following the principle of ''[[restitutio in integrum]]'' ([[Latin]] for "restoration to the original condition"). Thus, for most purposes connected with the quantification of damages, the degree of [[culpability]] in the breach of the duty of care is irrelevant. Once the breach of the duty is established, the only requirement is to compensate the victim.

One of the main tests that is posed when deliberating whether a claimant is entitled to compensation for a tort, is the "[[reasonable person]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Blyth v Birmingham Waterworks Co'' (1856) Ex Ch 781&lt;/ref&gt; The test is self-explanatory: would a reasonable person (as determined by a judge or jury), under the given circumstances, have done what the defendant did to cause the injury in question; or, in other words, would a reasonable person, acting reasonably, have engaged in similar conduct when compared to the one whose actions caused the injury in question? Simple as the "reasonable person" test sounds, it is very complicated. It is a risky test because it involves the opinion of either the judge or the jury that can be based on limited facts. However, as vague as the "reasonable person" test seems, it is extremely important in deciding whether or not a plaintiff is entitled to compensation for a negligence tort.

Damages are compensatory in nature.  Compensatory damages addresses a plaintiff/claimant's losses (in cases involving physical or mental injury the amount awarded also compensates for pain and suffering). The award should make the plaintiff whole, sufficient to put the plaintiff back in the position he or she was before Defendant's negligent act.  Anything more would unlawfully permit a plaintiff to profit from the tort.

There are also two other general principles relating to damages. Firstly, the award of damages should take place in the form of a single lump sum payment. Therefore, a defendant should not be required to make periodic payments (however some statutes give exceptions for this). Secondly, the Court is not concerned with how the plaintiff uses the award of damages. For example, if a plaintiff is awarded $100,000 for physical harm, the plaintiff is not required to spend this money on medical bills to restore them to their original position - they can spend this money any way they want.&lt;ref name="'Todorovic v Waller"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|72|1981|litigants=Todorovic v Waller |parallelcite=(1981) 150 [[COmmonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 402 |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Types of damage
* [[Special damages]] - quantifiable dollar losses suffered from the date of defendant's negligent act (the tort) up to a specified time (proven at trial).  Special damage examples include lost wages, medical bills, and damage to property such as one's car.
* [[General damages]] - these are damages that are not quantified in monetary terms (e.g., there's no invoice or receipt as there would be to prove special damages).  A general damage example is an amount for the pain and suffering one experiences from a car collision. Lastly, where the plaintiff proves only minimal loss or damage, or the court or jury is unable to quantify the losses, the court or jury may award [[nominal damages]].
* [[Punitive damages]] - Punitive damages are to punish a defendant, rather than to compensate plaintiffs, in negligence cases. In most jurisdictions punitive damages are recoverable in a negligence action, but only if the plaintiff shows that the defendant’s conduct was more than ordinary negligence (i.e., wanton and willful or reckless).
* Aggravated damages - In contrast to exemplary damages, compensation are given to the plaintiff when the harm is aggravated by the defendant's conduct. For example, the manner of this wrongful act increased the injury by subjecting the plaintiff to humiliation, insult.&lt;ref name="NSW v Riley"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWCA|208|2003|litigants=State of NSW v Riley |parallelcite= |courtname=auto |date=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure in the United States==
The United States generally recognizes four elements to a negligence action: duty, breach, proximate causation and injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Negligence and Tort Law|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/personal_injury/negligence.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=22 September 2017|date=21 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[plaintiff]] who makes a negligence claim must prove all four elements of negligence in order to win his or her case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Healey|first1=Paul D.|title=Chicken Little at the Reference Desk: The Myth of Librarian Liability|journal=Law Library Journal|date=1995|volume=87|page=515|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/llj87&amp;div=38&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if it is highly unlikely that the plaintiff can prove one of the elements, the defendant may request judicial resolution early on, to prevent the case from going to a jury. This can be by way of a [[demurrer]], motion to dismiss, or motion for [[summary judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Currie|first1=David P.|title=Thoughts on Directed Verdicts and Summary Judgments|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|date=Autumn 1977|volume=45|issue=1|pages=72–79|jstor=1599201|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elements allow a defendant to test a plaintiff's accusations before trial, as well as providing a guide to the [[finder of fact]] at trial (the judge in a bench trial, or jury in a jury trial) to decide whether the defendant is or is not liable. Whether the case is resolved with or without trial again depends heavily on the particular facts of the case, and the ability of the parties to frame the issues to the court. The duty and causation elements in particular give the court the greatest opportunity to take the case from the jury, because they directly involve questions of policy.&lt;ref name="mclauchlan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McLauchlan|first1=William P.|title=An Empirical Study of the Federal Summary Judgment Rule|journal=The Journal of Legal Studies|date=June 1977|volume=6|issue=2|pages=427–459|doi=10.1086/467581}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court can find that regardless of any disputed facts, the case may be resolved as a matter of law from undisputed facts because as a matter of law the defendant cannot be legally responsible for the plaintiff's injury under a theory of negligence.&lt;ref name="mclauchlan"/&gt;

On appeal, depending on the disposition of the case and the question on appeal, the court reviewing a trial court's determination that the defendant was negligent will analyze at least one of the elements of the cause of action to determine if it is properly supported by the facts and law. For example, in an appeal from a final judgment after a jury verdict, the appellate court will review the record to verify that the jury was properly instructed on each contested element, and that the record shows sufficient evidence for the jury's findings. On an appeal from a dismissal or judgment against the plaintiff without trial, the court will review ''[[De novo review|de novo]]'' whether the court below properly found that the plaintiff could not prove any or all of his or her case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hofer|first1=Ronald R.|title=Standards of Review - Looking beyond the Labels|journal=Marquette Law Review|date=1990|volume=74|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/marqlr74&amp;div=14&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=22 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Nothing'''", used as a pronoun subject, denotes the absence of a [[Something (concept)|something]] or particular thing that one might expect or desire to be present ("We found nothing," "Nothing was there") or the inactivity of a thing or things that are usually or could be active ("Nothing moved," "Nothing happened").  As a predicate or complement "nothing" denotes the absence of meaning, value, worth, relevance, standing, or [[importance|significance]] ("It is a tale/ Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,/ Signifying nothing"; "The affair meant nothing"; "I'm nothing in their eyes").&lt;ref name=MWD&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nothing "Nothing"], ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt;  "'''Nothingness'''" is a philosophical term that denotes the general state of [[nonexistence]], sometimes reified as a domain or dimension into which things pass when they cease to exist or out of which they may come to exist, e.g., God is understood to have created the universe ''ex nihilo'', "out of nothing."&lt;ref name=MWD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;definition of suffix "-ness" - ''"the state of being"'', Yourdictionary.com, [www.yourdictionary.com/ness-suffix]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
===Western philosophy===
Some would consider the study of "nothing" to be foolish. A typical response of this type is voiced by [[Giacomo Casanova]] (1725–1798) in conversation with his landlord, one Dr. Gozzi, who also happens to be a priest:

{{cquote|As everything, for him, was an article of faith, nothing, to his mind, was difficult to understand: the Great Flood had covered the entire world; before, men had the misfortune of living a thousand years; God conversed with them; Noah had taken one hundred years to build the ark; while the earth, suspended in air, stood firmly at the center of the universe that God had created out of nothingness.  When I said to him, and proved to him, that the existence of nothingness was absurd, he cut me short, calling me silly.&lt;ref&gt;Giacomo Casanova, ''The Story of My Life'', p. 29, translators: Stephen Sartarelli, Sophie Hawkes, Penguin Classics, 2001 {{ISBN|0-14-043915-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, "nothingness" has been treated as a serious subject for a very long time.  In philosophy, to avoid linguistic traps over the meaning of "nothing",  a phrase such as ''not-being'' is often employed to make clear what is being discussed.

====Parmenides====
One of the earliest Western philosophers to consider nothing as a concept was [[Parmenides]] (5th century BC), who was a Greek philosopher of the [[monist]] school.  He argued that "nothing" cannot exist by the following line of reasoning: To speak of a thing, one has to speak of a thing that exists.  Since we can speak of a thing in the past, this thing must still exist (in some sense) now, and from this he concludes that there is no such thing as change.  As a corollary, there can be no such things as ''coming-into-being'', ''passing-out-of-being'', or ''not-being''.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 66–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parmenides was taken seriously by other philosophers, influencing, for instance, [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Aristotle gives Parmenides serious consideration but concludes; "Although these opinions seem to follow logically in a dialectical discussion, yet to believe them seems next door to madness when one considers the facts."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''On Generation and Corruption'', '''I''':8, 350 BC, translator H. H. Joachim, The Internet Classics Archive, [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/gener_corr.1.i.html retrieved] 24 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, [[Albert Einstein]]'s concept of [[spacetime]] has led many scientists, including Einstein himself, to adopt a position remarkably similar to Parmenides.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Popper]], ''The World of Parmenides: Essays on the Presocratic Enlightenment'', p. 172, Routledge, 2013 {{ISBN|1317835018}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the death of his friend [[Michele Besso]], Einstein consoled his widow with the words "Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me.  That signifies nothing.  For those of us that believe in physics, the distinction between past, present and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion." &lt;ref&gt;[[Gary R. Mar|Gary Mar]], "Gödel's ontological dream", ch. 36 in Shyam Wuppuluri, Giancarlo Ghirardi (eds), ''Space, Time and the Limits of Human Understanding'', p. 469, Springer, 2016 {{ISBN|3319444182}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Leucippus=====
[[Leucippus]] (early 5th century BC), one of the [[atomists]], along with other philosophers of his time, made attempts to reconcile this monism with the everyday observation of motion and change.  He accepted the [[monist]] position that there could be no motion without a void.  The void is the opposite of being. It is ''not-being''.  On the other hand, there exists [[Something_(concept)|something]] known as an absolute [[wikt:plenum|plenum]], a space filled with matter, and there can be no motion in a plenum because it is completely full.  But, there is not just one monolithic plenum, for existence consists of a multiplicity of plenums.  These are the invisibly small "atoms" of Greek atomist theory, later expanded by [[Democritus]] (circa 460 BC – 370 BC), which allows the void to "exist" between them.  In this scenario, macroscopic objects can ''come-into-being'', move through space, and pass into ''not-being'' by means of the coming together and moving apart of their constituent atoms.  The void must exist to allow this to happen, or else the "frozen world" of Parmenides must be accepted.

[[Bertrand Russell]] points out that this does not exactly defeat the argument of Parmenides but, rather, ignores it by taking the rather modern scientific position of starting with the observed data (motion, etc.) and constructing a theory based on the data, as opposed to Parmenides' attempts to work from pure logic.  Russell also observes that both sides were mistaken in believing that there can be no motion in a plenum, but arguably motion cannot ''start'' in a plenum.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cyril Bailey notes that Leucippus is the first to say that a "thing" (the void) might be real without being a body and points out the irony that this comes from a materialistic atomist.  Leucippus is  therefore the first to say that "nothing" has a reality attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Bailey, ''The Greek Atomists and Epicurus: A Study'', pp. 75–76, The Clarendon Press, 1928.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aristotle, Newton, Descartes====
[[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) provided the classic escape from the logical problem posed by Parmenides by distinguishing things that are ''matter'' and things that are ''space''.  In this scenario, space is not "nothing" but, rather, a receptacle in which objects of matter can be placed.  The true void (as "nothing") is different from "space" and is removed from consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Categories'', '''I''':6, 350 BC, translator, E. M. Edghill, The Internet Classics Archive [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/categories.1.1.html retrieved] 24 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Categories'', '''III''':7, 350 BC, translator, J. L. Stocks, The Internet Classics Archive [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.3.iii.html retrieved] 24 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This characterisation of space reached its pinnacle with [[Isaac Newton]] who asserted the existence of absolute space.

[[René Descartes]], on the other hand, returned to a Parmenides-like argument of denying the existence of space.  For Descartes, there was matter, and there was extension of matter leaving no room for the existence of "nothing".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that space can actually be empty was generally still not accepted by philosophers who invoked arguments similar to the plenum reasoning.  Although Descartes views on this were challenged by [[Blaise Pascal]], he declined to overturn the traditional belief, ''[[Horror vacui (physics)|horror vacui]]'', commonly stated as "nature abhors a vacuum".  This remained so until [[Evangelista Torricelli]] invented the [[barometer]] in 1643 and showed that an empty space appeared if the mercury tube was turned upside down.  This phenomenon being known as the Torricelli vacuum and the unit of vacuum pressure, the [[torr]], being named after him.  Even Torricelli's teacher, the famous [[Galileo Galilei]] had previously been unable to adequately explain the sucking action of a pump.&lt;ref&gt;Pieper, pp. 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

====John the Scot====
John the Scot, or [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]] (c. 815–877) held many surprisingly heretical beliefs for the time he lived in for which no action appears ever to have been taken against him.  His ideas mostly stem from, or are based on his work of translating [[pseudo-Dionysius]].  His beliefs are essentially [[pantheist]] and he classifies evil, amongst many other things, into ''not-being''.  This is done on the grounds that evil is the opposite of good, a quality of God, but God can have no opposite, since God is everything in the pantheist view of the world.  Similarly, the idea that God created the world out of "nothing" is to be interpreted as meaning that the "nothing" here is synonymous with God.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 396–401.&lt;/ref&gt;

====G. W. F. Hegel====
[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) is the philosopher who brought the [[dialectic]]al method to a new pinnacle of development.  According to Hegel in ''[[Science of Logic]]'', the dialectical methods consists of three steps.  First, a thesis is given, which can be any [[proposition]] in [[logic]].  Second, the antithesis of the thesis is formed and, finally, a synthesis incorporating both thesis and antithesis.  Hegel believed that no proposition taken by itself can be completely true.  Only the whole can be true, and the dialectical synthesis was the means by which the whole could be examined in relation to a specific proposition.  Truth consists of the whole process. Separating out thesis, antithesis, or synthesis as a stand-alone statement results in something that is in some way or other untrue.  The concept of "nothing" arises in Hegel right at the beginning of his ''Logic''.  The whole is called by Hegel the "Absolute" and is to be viewed as something spiritual.  Hegel then has:&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 701–704.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thesis]]: The Absolute is Pure Being
* [[Antithesis]]: The Absolute is Nothing
* [[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|Synthesis]]: The Absolute is Becoming

====Existentialists====
The most prominent figure among the [[existentialism|existentialists]] is [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], whose ideas in his book ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (''L'être et le néant'') are heavily influenced by ''[[Being and Time]]'' (''Sein und Zeit'') of [[Martin Heidegger]], although Heidegger later stated that he was misunderstood by Sartre.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, "Letter on 'Humanism'," ''Pathmarks'' (Cambridge &amp; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 250–251.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sartre defines two kinds of "being" (être).  One kind is ''être-en-soi'', the brute existence of things such as a tree.  The other kind is ''être-pour-soi'' which is consciousness.  Sartre claims that this second kind of being is "nothing" since consciousness cannot be an object of consciousness and can possess no essence.&lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Solomon, ''From Hegel to Existentialism'', pp. 286-287, Oxford University Press US, 1989, {{ISBN|0-19-506182-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sartre, and even more so, [[Jaques Lacan]], use this conception of nothing as the foundation of their atheist philosophy. Equating nothingness with being leads to creation from nothing and hence God is no longer needed for there to be existence.&lt;ref&gt;Conor Cunningham, ''A Genealogy of Nihilism: Philosophies of Nothing and the Difference of Theology'', pp. 251–255, Routledge, 2002 {{ISBN|0-415-27694-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern philosophy===
{{Expand section|date=May 2009}}
The understanding of 'nothing' varies widely between cultures, especially between Western and Eastern cultures and philosophical traditions. For instance, ''[[Śūnyatā]]'' (emptiness), unlike "nothingness", is considered to be a [[Philosophy of mind|state of mind]] in some forms of [[Buddhism]] (see [[Nirvana]], [[mu (negative)|mu]], and [[Bodhi]]). Achieving 'nothing' as a state of mind in this tradition allows one to be totally focused on a thought or activity at a level of intensity that they would not be able to achieve if they were [[consciousness|consciously]] thinking. A classic example of this is an archer attempting to erase the mind and clear the thoughts to better focus on the shot. Some authors have pointed to similarities between the Buddhist conception of nothingness and the ideas of Martin Heidegger and existentialists like Sartre,&lt;ref&gt;Steven William Laycock, ''Nothingness and Emptiness: A Buddhist Engagement with the Ontology of Jean-Paul Sartre'', SUNY Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0-7914-4909-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles B. Guignon, ''The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger'', pp. 293–325, Cambridge University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-521-82136-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although this connection has not been explicitly made by the philosophers themselves.

In some [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophies]], the concept of "nothingness" is characterized by an [[Egolessness|egoless]] state of being in which one fully realizes one's own small part in the cosmos.

The [[Kyoto School]] handles the concept of nothingness as well.

==Computing==
{{See also|Ternary logic}}

In [[computing]], "nothing" can be a [[Keyword (computer programming)|keyword]] (in [[VB.Net]]) used in place of something unassigned, a [[data abstraction]]. Although a computer's storage hardware always contains numbers, "nothing" symbolizes a number skipped by the system when the programmer desires. Many systems have similar capabilities but different keywords, such as "[[Nullable type|null]]" (e.g. [[SQL]]), "[[Null character|NUL]]", "[[nil (disambiguation)#Computer programming|nil]]", and "None" ([[Python (programming language)|Python]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/c-api/none.html |title=The None Object — Python v2.7.1 documentation |publisher=Docs.python.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To instruct a computer [[Central processing unit|processor]] to do nothing, a keyword such as "[[NOP (code)|NOP]]" may be available. This is a [[control abstraction]]; a processor that executes NOP will behave identically to a processor that does not process this directive.&lt;ref name=arm-manual&gt;[http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.dui0041c/Caccegih.html NOP - ARM Software Developer Toolkit Reference Guide].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''observer''' has a number of non-equivalent uses in science.

==Special relativity==
{{main|Observer (special relativity)}}
The term observer in [[special relativity]] refers most commonly to an [[inertial reference frame]].
In such cases an inertial reference frame may be called an "inertial observer" to avoid ambiguity. Note that these uses differ significantly from the ordinary English meaning of "observer". Reference frames are inherently nonlocal constructs, covering all of space and time or a nontrivial part of it; thus it does not make sense to speak of an observer (in the special relativistic sense) having a location, except for denoting the [[Origin_(mathematics)|origin]] of his reference frame. Also, an inertial observer cannot accelerate at a later time, nor can an accelerating observer stop accelerating.

==General relativity==
In [[general relativity]] the term "observer" refers more commonly to a person (or a machine) making passive{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;!--Before removing this template please consider also removing the term "passive". How can a "local measurement" be considered "passive"?--&gt; local measurements, a usage much closer to the ordinary English meaning of the word. Commonly used are FIDO (fiducial observer,  stationary), FFO (free falling observer), ZAMO (zero angular momentum observer, corotating). 

==Quantum mechanics==
{{Main|Observer (quantum physics)}}
{{See also|Schrödinger's cat}}
In [[quantum mechanics]], "observation" is synonymous with [[measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurement]] and "observer" with a measurement apparatus and [[observable]] with what can be measured.

==Thermodynamics and information theory==
See for example [[Maxwell's demon]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to thought (thinking):

'''[[Thought]]''' (also called '''thinking''') &amp;ndash; the [[mental process]] in which beings form psychological associations and [[model (abstract)|models]] of the world.  Thinking is manipulating [[information]], as when we form [[concept]]s, engage in [[problem solving]], [[reason]] and make [[choice|decision]]s.  Thought, the act of thinking, produces thoughts.  A thought may be an idea, an image, a sound or even an emotional feeling that arises from the brain.

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== Nature of thought ==

Thought (or thinking) can be described as all of the following:

* An activity taking place in a:
** [[brain]] &amp;ndash; organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals (only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain). It is the physical structure associated with the mind.
*** [[mind]] &amp;ndash; abstract entity with the [[cognition|cognitive]] faculties of [[consciousness]], [[perception]], [[thought|thinking]], [[judgement]], and [[memory]]. Having a mind is a characteristic of living creatures.&lt;ref name="dict"&gt;Dictionary.com, "mind": "1. (in a human or other &lt;u&gt;conscious being&lt;/u&gt;) the element, part, substance, or process that reasons, thinks, feels, wills, perceives, judges, etc.: &lt;u&gt;the processes of the mind&lt;/u&gt;. 2. Psychology. the totality of &lt;u&gt;conscious and unconscious mental processes&lt;/u&gt; and activities. 3. intellect or understanding, as distinguished from the faculties of feeling and willing; &lt;u&gt;intelligence&lt;/u&gt;."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Google definition, "mind": "The &lt;u&gt;element&lt;/u&gt; of a person that enables them to be aware of the world and their experiences, to think, and to feel; the faculty of consciousness." [https://www.google.com/search?q=Mind#hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=definition+of+mind&amp;oq=definition+of+mind]&lt;/ref&gt; Activities taking place in a mind are called [[mental process]]es or [[cognitive function]]s.
** [[computer]] (see {{section link||Machine thought}} below) &amp;ndash; general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. Since a sequence of operations (an [[algorithm]]) can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem.
* An activity of [[intelligence]] &amp;ndash; intelligence is the [[intellect]]ual prowess of  which is marked by [[cognition]], [[motivation]], and [[self-awareness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tirri, Nokelainen|title=Measuring Multiple Intelligences and Moral Sensitivities in Education|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-94-6091-758-5|url=https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9789460917585}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intelligence, living creatures possess the cognitive abilities to learn, form concepts, understand, apply logic, and reason, including the capacities to recognize patterns, comprehend ideas, plan, problem solve, make decisions, retaining, and use language to communicate. Intelligence enables living creatures to experience and think.
** A type of [[mental process]] &amp;ndash; something that individuals can do with their minds. Mental processes include perception, memory, thinking, volition, and emotion. Sometimes the term ''[[cognitive function]]'' is used instead.
* Thought as a biological adaptation mechanism&lt;ref name=Nikolic2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.danko-nikolic.com/?smd_process_download=1&amp;download_id=724|title=Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. arXiv:1402.5332 [q-bio.NC].|author=Danko Nikolić|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Problem-solving strategy &amp;ndash; steps one would use to find the problem(s) that are in the way to getting to one’s own goal. Some would refer to this as the ‘problem-solving cycle’ (Bransford &amp; Stein, 1993). In this cycle one will recognize the problem, define the problem, develop a strategy to fix the problem, organize the knowledge of the problem cycle, figure-out the resources at the user's disposal, monitor one's progress, and evaluate the solution for accuracy.
** [[Abstraction]] &amp;ndash;  solving the problem in a model of the system before applying it to the real system
** [[Analogy]] &amp;ndash;  using a solution that solves an analogous problem
** [[Brainstorming]] &amp;ndash;  (especially among groups of people) suggesting a large number of solutions or ideas and combining and developing them until an optimum solution is found
** [[Analysis|Divide and conquer]] &amp;ndash;  breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable problems
** [[Hypothesis testing]] &amp;ndash;  assuming a possible explanation to the problem and trying to prove (or, in some contexts, disprove) the assumption
** [[Lateral thinking]] &amp;ndash;  approaching solutions indirectly and creatively
** [[Means-ends analysis]] &amp;ndash;  choosing an action at each step to move closer to the goal
** [[Method of focal objects]] &amp;ndash;  synthesizing seemingly non-matching characteristics of different objects into something new
** [[Morphological analysis (problem-solving)|Morphological analysis]] &amp;ndash;  assessing the output and interactions of an entire system
** [[Proof (truth)|Proof]] &amp;ndash;  try to prove that the problem cannot be solved. The point where the proof fails will be the starting point for solving it
** [[Reduction (complexity)|Reduction]] &amp;ndash;  transforming the problem into another problem for which solutions exist
** [[Research]] &amp;ndash;  employing existing ideas or adapting existing solutions to similar problems
** [[Root cause analysis]] &amp;ndash;  identifying the cause of a problem
** [[Trial-and-error]] &amp;ndash;  testing possible solutions until the right one is found

* [[Heuristic]]s
* [[Historical thinking]]
* [[Intuitive reasoning]]
* [[Lateral thinking]]

** [[Deductive reasoning]] &amp;ndash; from meaning postulate, axiom, or contingent assertion: if ''p'' then ''q'' (i.e., ''q'' or ''not-p'')
** [[Inductive reasoning]] &amp;ndash; theory formation; from data, coherence, simplicity, and confirmation: (inducibly) "if ''p'' then ''q''"; hence, if ''p'' then (deducibly-but-revisably) ''q''
** [[Inference]]
* [[Moral reasoning]] &amp;ndash; process in which an individual tries to determine the difference between what is right and what is wrong in a personal situation by using logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of: Moral Reasoning|url=http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Moral%20Reasoning|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an important and often daily process that people use in an attempt to do the right thing.  Every day for instance, people are faced with the dilemma of whether or not to lie in a given situation.  People make this decision by reasoning the morality of the action and weighing that against its consequences.
* [[Probabilistic reasoning]] &amp;ndash; from combinatorics and indifference: if ''p'' then (probably) ''q''
* [[Proportional reasoning]] &amp;ndash; using "the concept of proportions when analyzing and solving a mathematical situation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quizlet.com/dictionary/proportional-reasoning/|title=Dictionary Search › proportional reasoning - Quizlet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rational thinking]]
* [[Semiosis]]
* [[Statistical reasoning]] &amp;ndash; from data and presumption:  the frequency of ''q''s among ''p''s is high (or inference from a model fit to data); hence, (in the right context) if ''p'' then (probably) ''q''
* [[Synthetic reasoning]]
* [[Verbal reasoning]] &amp;ndash; understanding and reasoning using concepts framed in words
* [[Visual reasoning]] &amp;ndash; process of manipulating one's mental image of an object in order to reach a certain conclusion – for example, mentally constructing a piece of machinery to experiment with different mechanisms

'''Pattern theory''', formulated by [[Ulf Grenander]], is a mathematical [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] to describe knowledge of the world as patterns. It differs from other approaches to [[artificial intelligence]] in that it does not begin by prescribing [[algorithm]]s and machinery to recognize and classify patterns; rather, it prescribes a vocabulary to articulate and recast the pattern concepts in precise language.

In addition to the new algebraic vocabulary, its [[Statistics|statistical]] approach is novel in its aim to:
* Identify the [[Latent variable|hidden variables]] of a [[data set]] using real world data rather than artificial stimuli, which was previously commonplace.
* Formulate prior distributions for hidden variables and models for the observed variables that form the vertices of a [[Gibbs sampling|Gibbs]]-like graph.
* Study the randomness and variability of these graphs.
* Create the basic classes of [[stochastic]] models applied by listing the deformations of the patterns.
* Synthesize (sample) from the models, not just analyze signals with them.
Broad in its mathematical coverage, Pattern Theory spans algebra and statistics, as well as local topological and global entropic properties.

The [[Brown University]] Pattern Theory Group was formed in 1972 by [https://web.archive.org/web/20090122102751/http://www.dam.brown.edu/pattern/ug.html Ulf Grenander]. Many mathematicians are currently working in this group, noteworthy among them being the [[Fields Medal]]ist [[David Mumford]].  Mumford regards Grenander as his "guru" in this subject.

==Example: Natural Language Grammar==
[[File:grammar automaton.png|right|thumb|200px|Grammar automaton]]
[[File:generator list.png|right|frame|Grammar generators]]

We begin with an example to motivate the algebraic definitions that follow. If we want to represent language patterns, the most immediate candidate for primitives might be words.  However, [[set phrase]]s, such as “in order to”, immediately indicate the inappropriateness of words as atoms.  In searching for other primitives, we might try the rules of [[grammar]].  We can represent grammars as [[finite state automata]] or [[context-free grammar]]s.  Below is a sample finite state grammar automaton.

The following phrases are generated from a few simple rules of the [[automaton]] and programming code in pattern theory:
:: ''the boy who owned the small cottage went to the deep forest''
:: ''the prince walked to the lake''
:: ''the girl walked to the lake and the princess went to the lake''
:: ''the pretty prince walked to the dark forest''
To create such sentences, rewriting rules in finite state automata act as [[generator (mathematics)|generators]] to create the sentences as follows: if a machine starts in state 1, it goes to state 2 and writes the word “the”.  From state 2, it writes one of 4 words:  prince, boy, princess, girl, chosen at random. The probability of choosing any given word is given by the [[Markov chain]] corresponding to the automaton.  Such a simplistic automaton occasionally generates more awkward sentences
:: ''the evil evil prince walked to the lake''
:: ''the prince walked to the dark forest and the prince walked to a forest and the princess who lived in some big small big cottage who owned the small big small house went to a forest''

From the finite state diagram we can infer the following generators (shown at right) that creates the  signal.  A generator is a 4-tuple:  current state, next state, word written, probability of written word when there are multiple choices.  That is, each generator is a [[state transition]] arrow of [[state diagram]] for a Markov chain.

Imagine that a configuration of generators are strung together linearly so its output forms a sentence, so each generator "bonds" to the generators before and after it.  Denote these bonds as 1a,1b,2a,2b,…12a,12b.  Each numerical label corresponds to the automaton's state and each letter "a" and "b" corresponds to the inbound and outbound bonds.  Then the following bond table (left) is equivalent to the automaton diagram. For the sake of simplicity, only half of the bond table is shown—the table is actually [[Symmetry|symmetric]].

As one can tell from this example, and typical of signals that are studied, identifying the primitives and bond tables requires some thought.  The example highlights another important fact not readily apparent in other signals problems: that a configuration is not the signal that is observed; rather, its image as a sentence is observed.  Herein lies a significant justification for distinguishing an observable from a non-observable construct.  Additionally, it provides an algebraic structure to associate with [[hidden Markov model]]s.  In sensory examples such as the vision example below, the hidden configurations and observed images are much more similar, and such a distinction may not seem justified.  Fortunately, the grammar example reminds us of this distinction.

A more sophisticated example can be found in the [[link grammar]] theory of [[natural language]].

==Algebraic foundations==
Motivated by the example, we have the following definitions:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A '''generator''' &lt;math&gt;g{\in}G&lt;/math&gt;, drawn as
:[[File:Generators 1.jpg|300px|1 and 2 dimensional generators]]
is the primitive of Pattern Theory that generates the observed signal.   Structurally, it is a value with interfaces, called bonds &lt;math&gt;b{\in}B&lt;/math&gt;, which connects the &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;'s to form a signal generator.  2 neighboring generators are connected when their bond values are the same.  Similarity self-maps &lt;math&gt;s{\in}S&lt;/math&gt; s: G -&gt; G express the invariances of the world we are looking at, such as rigid body transformations, or scaling.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Bonds glue generators into a '''configuration''', c, which creates the signal against a backdrop '''Σ''', with global features described locally by a bond coupling table called &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.  The boolean function &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the principal component of the regularity 4-tuple &lt;G,S, &amp;rho;,Σ&gt;, which is defined as

: &lt;math&gt; \rho(c) = \prod_{ \text{neighboring bonds }b',b'' \in c } \rho(b',b'' ). &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; seems to capture the notion of allowable generator neighbors.  That is, Regularity is the law of the stimulus domain defining, via a bond table, what neighbors are acceptable for a generator.  It is the laws of the stimulus domain.  Later, we will relax regularity from a boolean function to a probability value, it would capture what stimulus neighbors are probable.

'''Σ''' is the physical arrangement of the generators.  In vision, it could be a 2-dimensional lattice.  In language, it is a linear arrangement.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  An '''image''' (C mod R) captures the notion of an observed Configuration, as opposed to one which exists independently from any perceptual apparatus.  Images are configurations distinguished only by their external bonds, inheriting the configuration’s composition and similarities transformations.  Formally, images are equivalence classes partitioned by an Identification Rule "~" with 3 properties:
# ext(c) = ext(c') whenever c~c'
# sc~sc' whenever c~c'
# sigma(c1,c2) ~ sigma(c1',c2') whenever c1~c1', c2~c2' are all regular.
A configuration corresponding to a physical stimulus may have many images, corresponding to many observer perception's identification rule.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A '''pattern'''  is the repeatable components of an image, defined as the S-invariant subset of an image.  Similarities are reference transformations we use to define patterns, e.g. rigid body transformations.  At first glance, this definition seems suited for only texture patterns where the minimal sub-image is repeated over and over again.  If we were to view an image of an object such as a dog, it is not repeated, yet seem like it seems familiar and should be a pattern.  (Help needed here).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A '''deformation''' is a transformation of the original image that accounts for the noise in the environment and error in the perceptual apparatus.  Grenander identifies 4 types of deformations:  noise and blur, multi-scale superposition, domain warping, and interruptions.

:'''Example 2'''  Directed boundary
[[File:directed boundary configuration.jpg|right|thumb|Configuration]]
[[File:directed boundary image.jpg|right|thumb|Image]]
[[File:directed boundary generators.jpg|right|thumb|Generators]]
:This configuration of generators generating the image is created by primitives woven together by the bonding table, and perceived by an observer with the identification rule that maps non "0" &amp; "1" generators to a single boundary element.  Nine other undepicted generators are created by rotating each of the non-"0"&amp;"1" generators by 90 degrees.  Keeping the feature of "directed boundaries" in mind, the generators are cooked with some thought and is interpreted as follows:  the "0" generator corresponds to interior elements, "1" to the exterior, "2" and its rotations are straight elements, and the remainder are the turning elements.

:With Boolean regularity defined as Product (all nbr bonds), any configurations with even a single generator violating the bond table is discarded from consideration.  Thus only features in its purest form with all neighboring generators adhering to the bond table are allowed.  This stringent condition can be relaxed using probability measures instead of Boolean bond tables.

::&lt;math&gt;p(c) = \prod_{ \text{neighboring bonds }b',b'' \in c } A(b',b'' ) &lt;/math&gt;

:The new regularity no longer dictates a perfect directed boundary, but it defines a probability of a configuration in terms of the Acceptor function A().  Such configurations are allowed to have impurities and imperfections with respect to the feature of interest.

With the benefit of being given generators and complete bond tables, a difficult part of pattern analysis is done.  In tackling a new class of signals and features, the task of devising the generators and bond table is much more difficult

Again, just as in grammars, identifying the generators and bond tables require some thought.  Just as subtle is the fact that a configuration is not the signal we observe. Rather, we observe its image as silhouette projections of the identification rule.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Pattern Theory defines order in terms of the feature of interest given by ''p''(''c'').

: Energy(''c'') = &amp;minus;log ''P''(''c'')

==Statistics==

Grenander’s Pattern Theory treatment of [[Bayesian inference]] in seems to be skewed towards on image reconstruction (e.g. content addressable memory).  That is given image I-deformed, find I.  However, Mumford’s interpretation of Pattern Theory is broader and he defines PT to include many more well-known statistical methods.  Mumford’s criteria for inclusion of a topic as Pattern Theory are those methods "characterized by common techniques and motivations", such as the [[Hidden Markov model|HMM]], [[Expectation Maximization|EM algorithm]], [[dynamic programming]] circle of ideas.  Topics in this section will reflect Mumford's treatment of Pattern Theory.  His principle of statistical Pattern Theory are the following:
* Use real world signals rather than constructed ones to infer the hidden states of interest.
* Such signals contain too much complexity and artifacts to succumb to a purely deterministic analysis, so employ stochastic methods too.
* Respect the natural structure of the signal, including any symmetries, independence of parts, marginals on key statistics.  Validate by sampling from the derived models by and infer hidden states with Bayes’ rule.
* Across all modalities, a limited family of deformations distort the ''pure patterns'' into real world signals.
* Stochastic factors affecting an observation show strong conditional independence.

Statistical PT makes ubiquitous use of conditional probability in the form of [[Bayes theorem]] and [[Hidden Markov models|Markov]] Models.  Both these concepts are used to express the relation between hidden states (configurations) and observed states (images).  Markov Models also captures the local properties of the stimulus, reminiscent of the purpose of bond table for regularity.

The generic set up is the following:
Let ''s'' = the hidden state of the data that we wish to know.  ''i'' = observed image.  Bayes theorem gives

:: ''p'' (''s'' | ''i'' ) ''p''(''i'') = ''p'' (''s'', ''i'' ) = ''p'' (''i''|''s'' ) ''p''(''s'')

:To analyze the signal (recognition):  fix i, maximize p, infer s.
:To synthesize signals (sampling): fix s, generate i's, compare w/ real world images

The following conditional probability examples illustrates these methods in action:

===Conditional probability for hidden-observed states===
====Bayes Theorem for Machine translation====
Supposing we want to translate French sentences to English. Here, the hidden configurations are English sentences and the observed signal they generate are French sentences. Bayes theorem gives ''p''(''e''|''f'')''p''(''f'') = ''p''(''e'', ''f'') = ''p''(''f''|''e'')''p''(''e'') and reduces to the fundamental equation of machine translation: maximize ''p''(''e''|''f'') = ''p''(''f''|''e'')''p''(''e'') over the appropriate ''e'' (note that ''p''(''f'') is independent of ''e'', and so drops out when we maximize over ''e'').  This reduces the problem to three main calculations for:
# ''p''(''e'') for any given ''e'', using the ''N''-gram method and dynamic programming
# ''p''(''f''|''e'') for any given ''e'' and ''f'', using alignments and an [[EM algorithm|expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm]]
# ''e'' that maximizes the product of 1 and 2, again, using dynamic programming
The analysis seems to be symmetric with respect to the two languages, and if we think can calculate ''p''(''f''|''e''), why not turn the analysis around and calculate ''p''(''e''|''f'') directly?  The reason is that during the calculation of ''p''(''f''|''e'') the asymmetric assumption is made that source sentence be well formed and we cannot make any such assumption about the target translation because we do not know what it will translate into.

We now focus on ''p''(''f''|''e'') in the three-part decomposition above.  The other two parts, ''p''(''e'') and maximizing ''e'', uses similar techniques as the ''N''-gram model.  Given a French-English translation from a large training data set (such data sets exists from the Canadian parliament),
        NULL   And    the    program      has    been    implemented
                      Le     programme    a ete     mis en application
the sentence pair can be encoded as an ''alignment'' (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6) that reads as follows: the first word in French comes from the second English word, the second word in French comes from the 3rd English word, and so forth.  Although an alignment is a straightforward encoding of the translation, a more computationally convenient approach to an alignment is to break it down into four parameters:
# ''Fertility'':  the number of words in the French string that will be connected to it.  E.g. ''n''( 3 | implemented ) = probability that “implemented” translates into three words – the word’s fertility
# ''Spuriousness'':  we introduce the artifact NULL as a word to represent the probability of tossing in a spurious French word.  E.g. {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and its complement will be {{math|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
# ''Translation'':  the translated version of each word.  E.g. ''t''(''a'' | has ) = translation probability that the English "has" translates into the French "a".
# ''Distortion'':  the actual positions in the French string that these words will occupy.  E.g.  ''d''( 5 | 2, 4, 6 ) = distortion of second position French word moving into the fifth position English word for a four-word English sentence and a six-word French sentence.  We encode the alignments this way to  easily represent and extract priors from our training data and the new formula becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
p(f|e) &amp; = \text{Sum over all possible alignments an of } p(a, f | e ) \\
&amp; = n_0(v_0 | \sum_{j=1}^{l}{v_j} )
\cdot \prod_{j=1}^{l} n(v_j | e_j)v_j! 
\cdot \prod_{j=1}^{m} t(f_j | e_{a_j}) 
\cdot \prod_{j:a_j\not =0}^{m} d(j | a_j,l,m)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For the sake of simplicity in demonstrating an EM algorithm, we shall go through a simple calculation involving only translation probabilities ''t''(), but needless to say that it the method applies to all parameters in their full glory.  Consider the simplified case (1) without the NULL word (2) where  every word has fertility 1 and (3) there are no distortion probabilities.  Our training data corpus will contain two-sentence pairs: ''bc''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''xy'' and ''b''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''y''.  The translation of a two-word English sentence “b c” into the French sentence “''x y''” has two possible alignments, and including the one-sentence words, the alignments are:
                          b c   b c   b
                          | |    x    |
                          x y   x y   y
called Parallel, Crossed, and Singleton respectively.

To illustrate an EM algorithm, first set the desired parameter uniformly, that is

: ''t''(''x'' | ''b'' ) = ''t''(''y'' | ''b'' ) = ''t''(''x'' | ''c'' ) = ''t''(''y'' | ''c'' ) = {{frac|1|2}}

Then EM iterates as follows
[[File:em iterations.jpg|frame|center|Iterations of an EM algorithm]]

The alignment probability for the “crossing alignment” (where ''b'' connects to ''y'') got a boost from the second sentence pair ''b''/''y''.  That further solidified ''t''(''y'' | ''b''), but as a side effect also boosted ''t''(''x'' | ''c''), because ''x'' connects to ''c'' in that same “crossing alignment.”  The effect of boosting ''t''(''x'' | ''c'') necessarily means downgrading ''t''(''y'' | ''c'') because they sum to one.  So, even though ''y'' and ''c'' co-occur, analysis reveals that they are not translations of each other.  With real data, EM also is subject to the usual local extremum traps.

====HMMs for speech recognition====
[[File:ski recording.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Vibrational breakdown of "ski"]]
For decades, speech recognition seemed to hit an impasse as scientists sought descriptive and analytic solution.  The [[sound wave]] p(t) below is produced by speaking the word “ski”.

Its four distinct segments has very different characteristics.   One can choose from many levels of generators (hidden variables): the intention of the speaker’s brain, the state of the mouth and vocal cords, or the ‘phones’ themselves.  Phones are the generator of choice to be inferred and it encodes the word in a noisy, highly variable way.  Early work on speech recognition attempted to make this inference deterministically using logical rules based on binary features extracted from p(t).  For instance, the table below shows some of the features used to distinguish [[English consonants]].

In real situations, the signal is further complicated by background noises such as cars driving by or artifacts such as a cough in mid sentence (Mumford’s 2nd underpinning).  The deterministic rule-based approach failed and the state of the art (e.g. Dragon Naturally Speaking) is to use  a family of precisely tuned HMMs and Bayesian MAP estimators to do better.  Similar stories played out in vision, and other stimulus categories.

A '''punishment''' is the imposition of an undesirable or [[unpleasant]] outcome upon a group or individual, meted out by an [[authority]]—in contexts ranging from [[child discipline]] to [[criminal law]]—as a response and deterrent to a particular action or [[behavior|behaviour]] that is deemed undesirable or unacceptable. The reasoning may be to condition a child to avoid self-endangerment, to impose social [[conformity]] (in particular, in the contexts of [[compulsory education]] or [[military discipline]]), to defend [[norm (social)|norm]]s, to protect against future harms (in particular, those from [[violent crime]]), and to maintain the [[law]]—and respect for [[rule of law]]—under which the social group is governed.&lt;ref name=stanford-crimeState&gt;

 |quote=Punishment under law... is the authorized imposition of deprivations—of freedom or privacy or other goods to which the person otherwise has a right, or the imposition of special burdens—because the person has been found guilty of some criminal violation, typically (though not invariably) involving harm to the innocent.

 |quote=Punishment... involves the intentional infliction of pain or of something unpleasant on someone who has committed a breach of rules... by someone who is in authority, who has a right to act in this way. Otherwise, it would be impossible to distinguish 'punishment' from 'revenge'. People in authority can, of course, inflict pain on people at whim. But this would be called 'spite' unless it were inflicted as a consequence of a breach of rules on the part of the sufferer. Similarly a person in authority might give a person £5 as a consequence of his breaking a rule. But unless this were regarded as painful or at least unpleasant for the recipient it could not be counted as a case of 'punishment'. In other words at least three criteria of (i) intentional infliction of pain (ii) by someone in authority (iii) on a person as a consequence of a breach of rules on his part, must be satisfied if we are to call something a case of 'punishment'. There are, as is usual in such cases, examples that can be produced which do not satisfy all criteria. For instance there is a colloquialism which is used about boxers taking a lot of punishment from their opponents, in which only the first condition is present. But this is a metaphorical use which is peripheral to the central use of the term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In so far as the different 'theories' of punishment are answers to questions about the meaning of 'punishment', only the retributive theory is a possible one. There is no conceptual connection between 'punishment' and notions like those of 'deterrence', 'prevention' and 'reform'. For people can be punished without being prevented from repeating the offence, and without being made any better. It is also a further question whether they themselves or anyone else is deterred from committing the offence by punishment. But 'punishment' ''must'' involve 'retribution', for 'retribution' implies doing something to someone in return for what he has done.... Punishment, therefore, must be retributive—by definition.}}

&lt;/ref&gt;  Punishment may be self-inflicted as with [[self-flagellation]] and [[mortification of the flesh]] in the religious setting, but is most often a form of social [[coercion]]. 

The unpleasant imposition may include a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]], [[Sanctions (law)|penalty]], or [[Imprisonment|confinement]], or be the removal or denial of something pleasant or desirable.  The individual may be a person, or even an animal.

&lt;/ref&gt; Research into punishment often includes similar research into prevention.

Justifications for punishment include [[Retributive justice|retribution]], [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrence]], [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]], and [[incapacitation (penology)|incapacitation]].

&lt;/ref&gt; Of the four justifications, only retribution is part of the definition of punishment and none of the other justifications is a guaranteed outcome, aside from obvious exceptions such as an executed man being incapacitated with regard to further crimes.&lt;ref name=Peters1966 /&gt;

If only some of the conditions included in the definition of punishment are present, descriptions other than "punishment" may be considered more accurate. Inflicting something negative, or unpleasant, on a person or animal, without authority is considered [[revenge]] or [[spite]] rather than punishment.&lt;ref name=Peters1966/&gt; In addition, the word "punishment" is used as a metaphor, as when a boxer experiences "''punishment''" during a fight. In other situations, breaking a rule may be rewarded, and so receiving such a reward naturally does not constitute punishment. Finally the condition of breaking (or breaching) the rules must be satisfied for consequences to be considered punishment.&lt;ref name=Peters1966/&gt;

Punishments differ in their degree of severity, and may include [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] such as [[reprimands]], deprivations of privileges or [[liberty]], fines, [[incarceration]]s, [[ostracism]], the infliction of [[pain]], [[amputation]] and the [[death penalty]].

===In philosophy===
Various philosophers have presented definitions of punishment.&lt;ref name=stanford-crimeState/&gt;&lt;ref name=punGR/&gt;&lt;ref name=stanford-theoryOf/&gt;&lt;ref name=Peters1966/&gt;&lt;ref name=j-kleining/&gt; Conditions commonly considered necessary properly to describe an action as punishment are that 
# it is imposed by an authority, 
# it involves some loss to the supposed offender, 
# it is in response to an offence and 
# the person (or animal) to whom the loss is imposed should be deemed at least somewhat responsible for the offence.

===In psychology===
{{Main article|Punishment (psychology)}}
Introduced by [[B.F. Skinner]], punishment has a more restrictive and technical definition.  Along with [[reinforcement]] it belongs under the [[operant conditioning]] category.  Operant conditioning refers to learning with either punishment (often confused as negative reinforcement) or a reward that serves as a positive reinforcement of the lesson to be learned. In psychology, punishment is the reduction of a behavior via application of an unpleasant stimulus ("''positive'' punishment") or removal of a pleasant stimulus ("''negative'' punishment"). Extra chores or [[spanking]] are examples of positive punishment, while removing an offending student's recess or play privileges are examples of negative punishment. The definition requires that punishment is only determined after the fact by the reduction in behavior; if the offending behavior of the subject does not decrease, it is not considered punishment.  There is some [[conflation]] of punishment and [[aversives]], though an aversion that does not decrease behavior is not considered punishment in psychology. Additionally, "aversive stimulus" is a label behaviorists generally apply to negative reinforcers (as in avoidance learning), rather than punishers.

===In socio-biology===
Punishment is sometimes called ''[[revenge|retaliatory]]'' or ''[[moralistic aggression]]'';{{Citation needed|date=October 2010|reason= 1. Why the focus on cheating? 2.

====Examples against sociobiological use====
One criticism of the claim of all social animals being evolutionarily hardwired for punishment comes from studies of animals, such as the [[octopus]]es near [[Capri]], Italy that suddenly formed communal cultures from having, until then lived solitary lives.  During a period of heavy fishing and tourism that encroached on their territory, they started to live in groups, learning from each other, especially hunting techniques.  Small, younger octopuses could be near the fully grown octopuses without being eaten by them, even though they, like other Octopus vulgaris, were [[cannibalism|cannibals]] until just before the group formation{{Citation needed|reason=The source paper is missing and can not be found with a cursory google search|date=February 2017}}. The authors stress that this behavior change happened too fast to be a genetic characteristic in the octopuses, and that there were certainly no mammals or other "naturally" social animals punishing octopuses for cannibalism involved. The authors also note that the octopuses adopted [[observational learning]] without any [[evolution]]ary history of specialized adaptation for it.&lt;ref&gt;"Observational Learning in Octopus vulgaris." Graziano Fiorito, Pietro Scotto. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aliens of the deep sea, documentary. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also arguments against the notion of punishment requiring intelligence, based on studies of punishment in very small-brained animals such as [[insect]]s. There is proof of [[honey bee]] workers with mutations that makes them fertile laying eggs only when other honey bees are not observing them, and that the few that are caught in the act are killed{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}. This is corroborated by [[computer simulation]]s proving that a few simple reactions well within mainstream views of the extremely limited intelligence of insects are sufficient to emulate the "political" behavior observed in [[great ape]]s. The authors argue that this [[falsifiability|falsifies]] the claim that punishment evolved as a strategy to deal with individuals capable of knowing what they are doing.&lt;ref&gt;How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence, Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard, foreword by Rodney Brooks. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of more complex brains, the notion of evolution selecting for specific punishment of intentionally chosen breaches of rules and/or wrongdoers capable of intentional choices (for example, punishing [[human]]s for murder while not punishing lethal [[virus]]es) is subject to criticism from [[coevolution]] issues. That punishment of individuals with certain characteristics (including but, in principle, not restricted to mental abilities) selects against those characteristics, making evolution of any mental abilities considered to be the basis for penal responsibility impossible in populations subject to such selective punishment. Certain scientists argue that this disproves the notion of humans having a biological feeling of intentional transgressions deserving to be punished.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche (1886) Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Elizabeth, et al. (1975). "Against 'Sociobiology'". [letter] New York Review of Books 22 (Nov. 13).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1979). Twelve misunderstandings of kin selection&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of application==
Punishments are applied for various purposes, most generally, to encourage and enforce proper behavior as defined by society or family. [[Criminal]]s are punished judicially, by [[Fine (penalty)|fines]], [[corporal punishment]] or [[custodial sentence]]s such as [[prison]]; detainees risk further punishments for breaches of internal rules. [[Child]]ren, pupils and other trainees may be punished by their educators or instructors (mainly [[parent]]s, [[legal guardian|guardian]]s, or [[teacher]]s, tutors and [[coach (sport)|coach]]es) – see [[Child discipline]].

[[Slaves]], domestic and other servants are subject to punishment by their [[Slave master|masters]]. Employees can still be subject to a contractual form of fine or [[demotion]]. Most hierarchical organizations, such as military and police forces, or even churches, still apply quite rigid internal discipline, even with a judicial system of their own ([[court martial]], [[canonical court]]s).

Punishment may also be applied on moral, especially religious, grounds, as in [[penance]] (which is voluntary) or imposed in a [[theocracy]] with a religious police (as in a strict [[Islamic state]] like [[Iran]] or under the [[Taliban]]) or (though not a true theocracy) by [[Inquisition]].

==Hell as punishment==
Belief that an individual's ultimate punishment is being sent by God, the highest authority, to an existence in Hell, a place believed to exist in the after-life, typically corresponds to [[sin]]s committed during their life. Sometimes these distinctions are specific, with [[Damnation#Christianity|damned souls]] suffering for each sin committed (see for example Plato's [[myth of Er]] or Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]''), but sometimes they are general, with condemned sinners relegated to one or more chamber of Hell or to a level of suffering.

In many religious cultures, including Christianity and Islam, Hell is traditionally depicted as fiery and painful, inflicting guilt and suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous verses in the Qu'ran and New Testament.&lt;/ref&gt;{{specify|date=January 2011}} Despite these common depictions of Hell as a place of fire, some other traditions portray Hell as cold. Buddhist – and particularly Tibetan Buddhist – descriptions of hell feature an equal number of hot and cold hells. Among Christian descriptions [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' portrays the innermost (9th) circle of Hell as a frozen lake of blood and guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==History and rationale==

=== Seriousness of a crime; Punishment fits the crime ===
{{main article|Retributive justice|Eye for an eye}}
{{see also|Felony|Misdemeanor}}
A principle often mentioned with respect to the degree of punishment to be meted out is that the punishment should match the crime.&lt;ref&gt;''Doing Justice – The Choice of Punishments'', A VONHIRSCH'', 1976, p. 220
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1372651 An Economic Analysis of the Criminal Law as Preference-Shaping Policy], Duke Law Journal, Feb 1990, Vol. 1, Kenneth Dau-Schmidt
&lt;/ref&gt;
One standard for measurement is the degree to which a crime affects others or society. Measurements of the [[degree of seriousness]] of a crime have been developed.&lt;ref name=OSS&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lynch | first1 = James P. | last2 = Danner | first2 = Mona J.

A [[felony]] is generally considered to be a crime of "high [[seriousness]]", while a [[misdemeanor]] is not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dagger|first=Richard|date=April 1993|title=Playing Fair with Punishment|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2381750?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=The University Chicago Press|volume=103|pages=473-488|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible reasons for punishment==
{{See also|Criminal justice}}
There are many possible reasons that might be given to justify or explain why someone ought to be punished; here follows a broad outline of typical, possibly conflicting, justifications.

=== Deterrence (prevention) ===
One reason given to justify punishment&lt;ref name=justify/&gt; is that it is a measure to prevent people from committing an offence - deterring previous offenders from re-offending, and preventing those who may be contemplating an offence they have not committed from actually committing it.  This punishment is intended to be sufficient that people would choose not to commit the crime rather than experience the punishment.  The aim is to deter everyone in the community from committing offences.

Some criminologists state that the number of people convicted for crime does not decrease as a result of more severe punishment and conclude that deterrence is ineffective.&lt;ref&gt; reference | J. Mitchell Miller | 2009 | 21st Century Criminology: A Reference Handbook &lt;/ref&gt; Other criminologists object to said conclusion, citing that while most people do not know the exact severity of punishment such as whether the sentence for murder is 40 years or life, most people still know the rough outlines such as the punishments for armed robbery or statutory rape being more severe than the punishments for driving too fast or misparking a car. These criminologists therefore argue that lack of deterring effect of increasing the sentences for already severely punished crimes say nothing about the significance of the existence of punishment as a deterring factor.&lt;ref&gt; reference | Gennaro F. Vito, Jeffrey R. Maahs | 2015 | Criminology &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; reference | Frank E. Hagan | 2010 | Introduction to Criminology: Theories, Methods, and Criminal Behavior &lt;/ref&gt;

Some criminologists argue that increasing the sentences for crimes can cause criminal investigators to give higher priority to said crimes so that a higher percentage of those committing them are convicted for them, causing statistics to give a false appearance of such crimes increasing. These criminologists argue that the use of statistics to gauge the efficiency of crime fighting methods are a danger of creating a reward hack that makes the least efficient criminal justice systems appear to be best at fighting crime, and that the appearance of deterrance being ineffective may be an example of this.&lt;ref&gt; reference | Anthony Walsh, Craig Hemmens | 2008 | Introduction to Criminology: A Text/Reader &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; reference | Ronald L. Akers | 2013 | Criminological Theories: Introduction and Evaluation &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rehabilitation ===
{{Main article|Rehabilitation (penology)}}
Some punishment includes work to reform and [[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitate]] the culprit so that they will not commit the offence again.&lt;ref name=justify/&gt; This is distinguished from deterrence, in that the goal here is to change the offender's attitude to what they have done, and make them come to see that their behavior was wrong.

=== Incapacitation and societal protection ===
Incapacitation as a justification of punishment&lt;ref name=justify/&gt; refers to the offender’s ability to commit further offences being removed. Imprisonment separates offenders from the community, removing or reducing their ability to carry out certain crimes. The death penalty does this in a permanent (and irrevocable) way. In some societies, people who stole have been punished by having their hands amputated.

=== Retribution ===
{{Main article|Retributive justice}}
Criminal activities typically give a benefit to the offender and a loss to the victim. Punishment has been justified as a measure of [[retributive justice]],&lt;ref name=justify/&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falls|first=Margaret|date=1987|title=Retribution, Reciprocity, and Respect for Persons|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3504678?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Law and Philosophy|volume=6|pages=25-51|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;in which the goal is to try to rebalance any unjust advantage gained by ensuring that the offender also suffers a loss. Sometimes viewed as a way of "getting even" with a wrongdoer—the suffering of the wrongdoer is seen as a desired goal in itself, even if it has no restorative benefits for the victim. One reason [[society|societies]] have administered punishments is to diminish the perceived need for retaliatory "street justice", [[blood feud]], and [[vigilante|vigilantism]].

=== Restoration ===
{{Main article|Restorative justice}}
For minor offenses, punishment may take the form of the offender "righting the wrong", or making restitution to the victim. [[Community service]] or compensation orders are examples of this sort of penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-articles.org.uk/libertarian_restitution.htm |title=restitution |publisher=La-articles.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In models of [[restorative justice]], victims take an ''active'' role in a process with their offenders who are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions, "to repair the harm they've done – by apologizing, returning stolen money, or community service."&lt;ref&gt;"A New Kind of Criminal Justice", ''Parade'', October 25, 2009, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  The restorative justice approach aims to help the offender want to avoid future offences.

=== Education and denunciation ===
[[File:Schwaebisch Hall pillory.jpg|thumb|upright|Gothic [[pillory]] (early 16th century) in [[Schwäbisch Hall]], Germany]]
Punishment can be explained by positive prevention theory to use the criminal justice system to teach people what are the social norms for what is correct, and acts as a reinforcement.

Punishment can serve as a means for society to publicly express denunciation of an action as being criminal. Besides educating people regarding what is not acceptable behavior, it serves the dual function of preventing vigilante justice by acknowledging public anger, while concurrently deterring future criminal activity by stigmatizing the offender.
This is sometimes called the "Expressive Theory" of denunciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/crim/crim01.htm |title=Theory, Sources, and Limitations of Criminal Law |accessdate=2011-09-26}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[pillory]] was a method for carrying out public denunciation.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
  | title =Theories Of Punishment
  | quote =Theories of punishment can be divided into two general philosophies: utilitarian and retributive.
  | publisher =Free Legal Encyclopedia
  | accessdate =2011-09-26
  | url =http://law.jrank.org/pages/9576/Punishment-THEORIES-PUNISHMENT.html
  }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics of the education and denunciation model cite [[evolution]]ary problems with the notion that a feeling for punishment as a social signal system evolved if punishment was not effective. The critics argue that some individuals spending time and energy and taking risks in punishing others, and the possible loss of the punished group members, would have been selected against if punishment served no function other than signals that could evolve to work by less risky means.&lt;ref&gt; reference | J. Robert Lilly, Francis T. Cullen, Richard A. Ball | 2014 | Criminological Theory: Context and Consequences &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; reference | Tim Newburn | 2017 | Criminology &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unified theory ===
A unified theory of punishment brings together multiple penal purposes — such as retribution, deterrence and rehabilitation — in a single, coherent framework. Instead of punishment requiring we choose between them, unified theorists argue that they work together as part of some wider goal such as the protection of rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195396577/obo-9780195396577-0094.xml |title=Thom Brooks on Unified Theory of Punishment |date= |accessdate=2014-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some people think that punishment as a whole is unhelpful and even harmful to the people that it is used against. Detractors argue that punishment is simply wrong, of the same design as "[[two wrongs make a right]]". Critics argue that punishment is simply [[revenge]]. Professor Deirdre Golash, [[author]] of the book, ''The Case against Punishment: Retribution, Crime Prevention, and the Law'', states in her book that,
{{quote|We ought not to impose such harm on anyone unless we have a very good reason for doing so. This remark may seem trivially true, but the history of humankind is littered with examples of the deliberate infliction of harm by well-intentioned persons in the vain pursuit of ends which that harm did not further, or in the successful pursuit of questionable ends. These benefactors of humanity sacrificed their fellows to appease mythical gods and tortured them to save their souls from a mythical hell, broke and bound the feet of children to promote their eventual marriageability, beat slow schoolchildren to promote learning and respect for teachers, subjected the sick to leeches to rid them of excess blood, and put suspects to the rack and the thumbscrew in the service of truth. They schooled themselves to feel no pity—to renounce human compassion in the service of a higher end. The deliberate doing of harm in the mistaken belief that it promotes some greater good is the essence of tragedy. We would do well to ask whether the goods we seek in harming offenders are worthwhile, and whether the means we choose will indeed secure them.&lt;ref name="golash"&gt;https://www.questia.com/read/117883311/the-case-against-punishment-retribution-crime-prevention&lt;/ref&gt;}} Golash also makes statements about [[imprisonment]], {{quote|Imprisonment means, at minimum, the loss of liberty and autonomy, as well as many material comforts, personal security, and access to heterosexual relations. These deprivations, according to Gresham Sykes (who first identified them) “together dealt 'a profound hurt' that went to 'the very foundations of the prisoner's being.}} {{quote|But these are only the minimum harms, suffered by the least vulnerable inmates in the best-run prisons. Most prisons are run badly, and in some, conditions are more squalid than in the worst of slums. In the District of Columbia jail, for example, inmates must wash their clothes and sheets in cell toilets because the laundry machines are broken. Vermin and insects infest the building, in which air vents are clogged with decades' accumulation of dust and grime. But even inmates in prisons where conditions are sanitary must still face the numbing boredom and emptiness of prison life—a vast desert of wasted days in which little in the way of meaningful activity is possible.&lt;ref name="golash" /&gt;}}

=== Destructiveness to thinking and betterment ===
There are critics of punishment who argue that punishment aimed at intentional actions forces people to suppress their ability to act on intent. Advocates of this viewpoint argue that such suppression of intention causes the harmful behaviors to remain, making punishment counterproductive. These people suggest that the ability to make intentional choices should instead be treasured as a source of possibilities of betterment, citing that complex cognition would have been an evolutionarily useless waste of energy if it led to justifications of fixed actions and no change as simple inability to understand arguments would have been the most thrifty protection from being misled by them if arguments were for social manipulation, and reject condemnation of people who intentionally did bad things.&lt;ref&gt;Mind, Brain and Education, Kurt Fischer, Christina Hinton&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment can be effective in stopping undesirable employee behaviors such as tardiness, absenteeism or substandard work performance. However, punishment does not necessarily cause an employee to demonstrate a desirable behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/wichita/stories/1996/11/18/focus3.html|title=Punishment in the workplace creates undesirable side effects|last=Milbourn Jr|first=Gene|date=November 1996|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 21 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The "Rats Dungeon", or "Dungeon of the Rats", was a feature of the [[Tower of London]] alleged by [[Roman Catholic]] writers from the [[Elizabethan era]]. "A cell below high-water mark and totally dark" would draw in rats from the [[River Thames]] as the tide flowed in. Prisoners would have their "alarm excited", and in some instances have "flesh ... torn from the arms and legs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During the [[Dutch Revolt]], [[Diederik Sonoy]], an ally of [[William the Silent]], is documented to have used a method where a [[pottery]] bowl filled with rats was placed open side down on the naked body of a prisoner. When hot [[charcoal]] was piled on the bowl, the rats would "gnaw into the very bowels of the victim" in an attempt to escape the heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Rat torture appears in the famous case study of a patient of [[Sigmund Freud]]. The [[Rat Man]] obsessed that his father and lady friend would be subjected to this torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=More about Rats and Rat People|journal=International Journal of Psycho-Analysis|volume=52|pages=277–288|author=Leonard Shengold|year=1971|pmid=5106163|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rat torture was allegedly used in [[Brazil]] during the [[Brazilian military government|military regime]] of 1964-1985,{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} in [[Chile]] during the [[Military dictatorship of Chile (1973–90)|regime of Augusto Pinochet]] (1973–1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Simmons|first=Elizabeth|title=Torture Under Pinochet's Regime|year=2009|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Argentina]] during the period of the [[National Reorganization Process]] (1976–1983).&lt;ref name="CONADEP"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nunca Más (Never Again); Report of CONADEP|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report of [[National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons|CONADEP]] in Argentina detailed the use of a torture method known as "the recto-scope" (reserved primarily for Jewish prisoners) which consisted of inserting living rats into a victim's [[rectum]] or [[vagina]] through a tube.&lt;ref name="CONADEP"/&gt; [[Amnesty International]] documented the case of a woman tortured by the Chilean CNI (National Intelligence Agency) in 1981, who described being kept in a room full of live rats during interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;Chile: Evidence of torture: an Amnesty International Report.

On October 16, 2010, in [[Lakewood Township, New Jersey]], [[David Wax]] was alleged to have threatened kidnap victim Yisrael Bryskman with rat torture unless he agreed to give his wife a [[get (divorce document)|get]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaer, Matthew (September 2, 2014) [https://www.gq.com/story/epstein-orthodox-hit-squad "Epstein Orthodox Hit Squad"], ''GQ''&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to 7 years imprisonment for assisting in a kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;(January 13, 2016) [http://www.timesofisrael.com/nj-couple-sentenced-for-helping-jewish-divorce-ring/ "NJ Couple Sentenced For Helping Jewish Divorce Ring"], ''The Times of Israel''&lt;/ref&gt;

== In fiction ==
[[File:Bizarre Museum 04.jpg|thumb|An erotic comic by [[Eric Stanton]] depicting rat torture]]
Rats are featured in the [[Edgar Allan Poe]] story ''[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]''. The narrator lies on [[the rack]], and can only watch as a [[scythe]] swings back and forth, approaching closer each time, as rats swarm over his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

An account similar to the Sonoy torture appears in the 1899 [[Octave Mirbeau]] novel ''[[The Torture Garden (novel)|The Torture Garden]]'', and psychologist Leonard Shengold has identified this as the possible source of the story that the Rat Man told Freud. Part of the book, an imaginary dialog between a torturer and a beautiful woman who is sexually excited by the accounts, is set in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The ministry imprisons him in [[Room 101]]. Here Winston must face his greatest fear: rats. A cage filled with hungry rats is placed over his head, their only source of food or escape being by eating their way through Winston's face. At this point Winston breaks and begs that the method actually be used on his lover Julia, a sign that he has finally been broken.

A '''repair kit''' or '''service kit''' is a set of items used to repair a device, commonly comprising both tools and spare parts. Many kits are designed for vehicles, such as cars, boats, airplanes, motorbikes, and bicycles, and may be kept with the vehicle in order to make on-the-spot repairs. Some are considered essential safety equipment, and may be included [[survival kit]]s. In the military, personnel crossing large water bodies in aircraft may be equipped with a raft and raft repair kit. Other kits, such as those for watch repair or specific engine components, are used by professionals. Depending on the type, a repair kits may be included when buying a product, or may be purchased separately.

==Examples==
[[File:STS-135 crew training Tool-Repair Kits with instructor Jeff Stone.jpg|thumb|left|[[NASA]] astronauts [[Chris Ferguson]] (left), [[STS-135]] commander; [[Doug Hurley]] (right), pilot, and [[Rex Walheim]], [[mission specialist]], participate in a tools and repair kits training session in the [[Space Vehicle Mockup Facility]] at NASA's [[Johnson Space Center]].]]

Road vehicles often include basic tools and spare parts which commonly fail. A bicycle repair kit, for example, normally contains tools as well as patches and glue to repair a punctured tire. Other kits that include patches and glue are used to fix holes in fabric items such as inflatable boats and tents.

Watercraft normally contain both safety equipment and repair kits as part of their emergency equipment.

Some automobiles, such as the [[Mitsubishi i-MiEV]], have an optional repair kit available. The [[Mercedes-Benz OM604 engine]] has an optional repair kit to help replace seals. The 1905 [[Western Tool Works (automobile company)|Gale Model A]] came with a repair kit.

In aerospace, kits have been developed for repairing the thermal protection tiles on the [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system#Early tile repair plans|Space Shuttle]] and to fix space suits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/22144-russian-progress-launch-spacesuit-repair.html|title=Russian Cargo Ship Launches Spacesuit Repair Kit to Space Station|work=Space.com|accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professionals who repair and maintain electronic equipment may have a kit containing a soldering iron, wire, and components such as transistors and resistors.

In medicine, a repair kit consisting of a plug and plastic mesh may be used during [[inguinal hernia surgery]].

A particular trade may use a repair kit as part of normal work, such as in watch repair and at automobile repair shops.

==Components==
[[File:HK HKCEC Wan Chai 蘇富比 Sotheby's Preview 拍賣 預展 Watch making repairs tools kit box.JPG|thumb|left|A watch repair kit]]
A wide variety of tools and replacement parts may be included in a repair kit. Some common examples include  [[screwdriver]], [[spare tire]], [[jumper cable]], and [[duct tape]].

==Development==
It is an offspring of the [[RepRap]],{{fact|date=October 2014}} the open-source self-replicating 3D printer project, and derringer, the Reprringer is a 5-shot, single-action, manually-indexed 6mm Flobert [[pistol]] developed by Hexen.&lt;ref name="D-printed Reprringer Pepperbox 2013"/&gt;

==Design==
Unlike the many early 3D-printed firearm designs, which are usually massively overbuilt in order to withstand the pressures and strain on the material from modern gunpowder cartridges, the Reprringer is small and only slightly larger than a gun made from steel.&lt;ref name="D-printed Reprringer Pepperbox 2013"/&gt; Two factors contribute to its small stature. First reason is that it is chambered for what is considered the least powerful commercially-produced cartridge on the market.&lt;ref name="D-printed Reprringer Pepperbox 2013"/&gt;

According to Guns.com the ".22 CB aka 6mm Flobert is made from a cut-down .22 rimfire case loaded with just a primer or the primer and very little powder and a lightweight bullet". This makes the cartridge roughly on par with some [[air rifle]]s in terms of muzzle energy. This therefore means that the Reprringer does not require as much barrel. The design is improved over early completely 3D-printed guns as it uses unrifled steel inserts in the cylinder. This makes the gun safer and more reliable, it also provides a more consistent seal around the projectile; the all-polymer barrels have the ability to flex, thus letting much of the propellant escape, and are inefficient.&lt;ref name="D-printed Reprringer Pepperbox 2013"/&gt;

Although the barrels are not rifled, the lack of theoretical accuracy therefrom is considered a relative non-issue in a small gun with no sights.&lt;ref name="D-printed Reprringer Pepperbox 2013"/&gt;

[[Image:JIE_Sankey_V5_Fig1.png|thumb|400px|Sankey's original 1898 diagram showing energy efficiency of a steam engine.]]

'''Sankey diagrams''' are a specific type of [[flow diagram]], in which the width of the arrows is shown proportionally to the flow quantity.

The illustration shows a Sankey diagram which represents all the primary energy flows into a factory. The widths of the bands are directly proportional to energy production, utilization and losses. The primary energy sources are gas, electricity and coal/oil and represent energy inputs at the left hand side of the Sankey diagram. They can also visualize the energy accounts, material flow accounts on a regional or national level, and also the breakdown of cost of item or services.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Sankey diagrams put a visual emphasis on the major transfers or flows within a system. They are helpful in locating dominant contributions to an overall flow. Often, Sankey diagrams show conserved quantities within defined system boundaries.

== History ==
Sankey diagrams are named after Irish Captain [[Matthew Henry Phineas Riall Sankey]], who used this type of [[diagram]] in 1898 in a classic figure (see panel on the right) showing the [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] of a [[steam engine]]. While the first charts in black and white were merely used to display one type of flow (e.g. steam), using colors for different types of flows has added more degrees of freedom to Sankey diagrams.

One of the most famous Sankey diagrams is [[Charles Minard]]'s Map of Napoleon's Russian Campaign of 1812. It is a [[flow map]], overlaying a Sankey diagram onto a geographical map. It was created in 1869, so it actually predates Sankey's 'first' Sankey diagram of 1898.

[[File:Minard.png|thumb|none|400px|Minard's classic diagram of [[Napoleon]]'s [[French invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]], using the feature now named after Sankey.]]

== Science == 
[[File:Earth_heat_balance_Sankey_diagram.svg|thumb|250px|[[Earth's energy budget]] &amp;ndash; line thickness is linearly proportional to relative amount of energy]]
Sankey diagrams are often used in fields of science, especially physics. They are used to represent energy inputs, useful output, and wasted output.

== Active examples ==
The United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) produces numerous Sankey diagrams annually in its ''Annual Energy Review''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Energy Review|url=http://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/annual/|website=Energy Information Administration|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which illustrate the production and consumption of various forms of energy. 

[[Eurostat]], the Statistical Office of the European Union, has developed an interactive Sankey web tool to visualise energy data by means of flow diagrams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy balance flow for European Union (28 countries) 2015|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/sankey/sankey.html?geo=EU28&amp;year=2015&amp;unit=KTOE&amp;fuels=0000&amp;highlight=&amp;nodeDisagg=0101000000&amp;flowDisagg=false|website=Eurostat|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool allows the building and customisation of diagrams by playing with different options (country, year, fuel, level of detail).

The [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) created an interactive Sankey web application] that details the flow of energy for the entire planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Balance (2015)|url=http://www.iea.org/Sankey/#?c=World&amp;s=Balance|website=International Energy Agency (IEA)|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can select specific countries, points of time back to 1973, and modify the arrangement of various flows within the Sankey diagram.

The US Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory maintains a site of Sankey diagrams, including US energy flow and carbon flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LLNL Flow Charts|url=https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/|website=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Schmidt, an assistant professor of history at Northeastern University, created a Sankey diagram relating majors in college to eventual careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schmidt|first1=Ben|title=What are you going to do with that degree?|url=http://benschmidt.org/jobs/|website=Ben Schmidt|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6600">{{See also|Single-elimination tournament}}

A '''seed''' is a competitor or team in a sport or other tournament who is given a preliminary ranking for the purposes of the draw. Players/teams are "planted" into the [[bracket (tournament)|bracket]] in a manner that is typically intended so that the best do not meet until later in the competition.  The term was first used in [[tennis]],&lt;ref&gt;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (2002), Fifth Edition, Oxford University Press, Oxford, Page 2737, {{ISBN|0-19-860457-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the idea of laying out a tournament ladder by arranging slips of paper with the names of players on them the way seeds or seedlings are arranged in a garden: smaller plants up front, larger ones behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Beard|first=Robert|title=seed|url=http://www.alphadictionary.com/goodword/word/seed|work=AlphaDictionary.com|publisher=Lexiteria|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the remaining competitors in a [[single-elimination tournament]] will be "re-seeded" so that the highest surviving seed is made to play the lowest surviving seed in the next round, the second-highest plays the second-lowest, etc.  This may be done after each round, or only at selected intervals.{{Citation needed|reason=Would be great to cite sports or tournaments that use this practice|date=July 2018}}

==Tennis==

Professional tennis tournaments seed players based on their rankings. The number of seeds varies from tournament to tournament. Generally the bigger the event the more seeds there tend to be relative to lesser events. The 4 major (Grand Slam) tournaments progressively expanded from 8-seed format to 16-seed, then to the current 32-seed format, which was adopted in the middle of the 2001 season, after French Open champion [[Gustavo Kuerten]] had complained that clay-court specialists were at a disadvantage with just 16 seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tennis.life/2018/09/13/grand-slams-vote-to-keep-32-seeds/|title=Grand Slams vote to keep 32 seeds - Tennis.life|date=2018-09-13|work=Tennis.life|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a tennis event, one version of seeding is where brackets are set up so that the quarterfinal pairings (barring any [[Upset (competition)|upset]]s) would be the 1 seed vs. the 8 seed, 2 vs. 7, 3 vs. 6 and 4 vs. 5; however, this is not the procedure that is followed in most tennis tournaments, where the 1 and 2 seeds are placed in separate brackets, but then the 3 and 4 seeds are assigned to their brackets randomly, and so too are seeds 5 through 8, and so on. This may result in some brackets consisting of stronger players than other brackets, and since only the top 32 players are seeded in [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Tennis Grand Slam]] tournaments, it is conceivable that the 33rd best player in a 128-player field could end up playing the top seed in the first round. A good example of this occurring was when World No. 33 [[Florian Mayer]] was drawn against (and eventually defeated by) then-World No. 1 [[Novak Djokovic]] in the first round of the [[2013 Wimbledon Championships &amp;ndash; Men's Singles|2013 Wimbledon Championships]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://novakdjokovic.com/en/news/tennis/wimbledon-novak-vs-mayer-in-r1-andy-roger-and-rafa-all-in-bottom-half/ Wimbledon: Novak vs Mayer in R1; Andy, Roger, Rafa all in bottom half], ''[[Novak Djokovic]] official website'', 21 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; in what was also a rematch of [[2012 Wimbledon Championships &amp;ndash; Gentlemen's Singles#Finals|a quarter-final from the previous year]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theroar.com.au/2013/06/22/wimbledon-2013-possible-mens-matches-to-watch-out-for/ Wimbledon 2013: Men's matches to watch out for], ''The Roar'', 22 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Rankings of tennis players, based on a history of performance, tend to change positions gradually, and so a more "equitable" method of determining the pairings might result in many of the same head-to-head match-ups being repeated in successive tournaments. An example of a seeded 16-team bracket:
{{16TeamBracket
| RD2=Quarterfinals
| RD2-seed01=1
| RD2-seed02=8
| RD2-seed03=5
| RD2-seed04=4
| RD2-seed05=6
| RD2-seed06=3
| RD2-seed07=7
| RD2-seed08=2
| RD3-seed01=1
| RD3-seed02=4
| RD3-seed03=3
| RD3-seed04=2
| RD4-seed01=1
| RD4-seed02=2
}}

==Other sports==
In American team sports, [[Major League Soccer|MLS]], [[National Football League|NFL]] and [[WNBA]] employ re-seeding in [[MLS Cup Playoffs]], [[NFL playoffs]] &amp; [[WNBA Playoffs]], respectively, while the [[NBA playoffs]] and the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] do not; the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[Stanley Cup Playoffs]] formerly used re-seeding between [[1994 Stanley Cup Playoffs|1994]] and [[2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2013]]. [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] does not have enough teams in its playoff tournament where re-seeding would make a difference in the matchups. (The MLS and NFL are at the minimum, which is 6 from each conference (or league in MLB) for a total of 12.) The NBA's format calls for the winner of the conference quarterfinal series between the first and eighth seeds (within each of the two conferences the league has) to face the winner of the other series between the fourth and fifth seeds in the next round, even if one or more of the top three seeds had been upset in their first-round series; critics have claimed that this gives a team fighting for the fifth and sixth seeding positions near the end of the regular season an incentive to [[match fixing|tank]] (deliberately lose) games, so as to finish sixth and thus avoid a possible matchup with the top seed until one round later. So will the winner of the second and seventh seeds to take on the winner of the third and sixth seeds.

In some situations, a seeding restriction will be implemented;  from 1975 until 1989 in the [[National Football League|NFL]] and from 1998 until 2011 in [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] there was a rule where at the conference or league semifinal, should the top seed and last seed (wild card) be from the same division, they may not play each other;  in that case, the top seed plays the worst division champion;  the second-best division champion plays the wild card team.

In international [[fencing]] competitions, it is common to have a [[group stage]]. Participants are divided in groups of 6–7 fencers who play a round-robin tournament, and a ranking is calculated from the consolidated group results. Single elimination is seeded from this ranking.

In [[mathematics]], a '''tensor''' is an arbitrarily complex [[geometry|geometric]] object that maps in a [[linear relation|(multi-)linear]] manner [[geometric vector]]s, [[Scalar (mathematics)|scalars]], and other tensors to a resulting tensor. Thereby, vectors and scalars themselves, often used already in elementary physics and engineering applications, are considered as the simplest tensors. Additionally, vectors from the [[dual space]] of the vector space, which supplies the geometric vectors, are also included as tensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Geometric'' in this context is chiefly meant to emphasize independence of any selection of a coordinate system.

Elementary examples of such relations include the [[dot product]], mapping two vectors to a tensor, which is a simple scalar. A more complex example is the [[Cauchy stress tensor]] '''T''', which takes a directional unit vector '''v''' as input and maps it to the stress vector '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;('''v''')&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the force (per unit area) exerted by material on the negative side of the plane orthogonal to '''v''' against the material on the positive side of the plane, thus expressing a relationship between these two vectors, shown in the figure (right). The [[cross product]], where two vectors are mapped to a third one, is strictly speaking not a tensor, because it changes its sign under those transformations that change the orientation of the coordinate system. The [[Levi-Civita symbol|totally anti-symmetric symbol]] &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; allows nevertheless a convenient handling of the cross product in equally oriented three dimensional coordinate systems.

Assuming a [[basis of a vector space|basis]] of a real vector space, e.g., a coordinate frame in the ambient space, a tensor can be represented as an organized [[Array data structure#Multidimensional arrays|multidimensional array]] of numerical values with respect to this specific basis. Changing the basis transforms the values in the array in a characteristic way that allows to ''define'' tensors as objects adhering to this transformational behavior. For example, there are invariants of tensors that must be preserved under any change of the basis, thereby making only certain multidimensional arrays of numbers a [[Tensor#Holors|tensor.]] Compare this to the array representing &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; not being a tensor, for the sign change under transformations changing the orientation.

Because the components of vectors and their duals transform differently under the change of their dual bases, there is a [[covariant transformation|covariant and/or contravariant transformation law]] that relates the arrays, which represent the tensor with respect to one basis and that with respect to the other one. The numbers of, respectively, {{nowrap|vectors: {{mvar|n}}}} ([[covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] indices) and dual {{nowrap|vectors: {{mvar|m}}}} ([[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] indices) in the input and output of a tensor determine the ''type'' (or ''valence'') of the tensor, a pair of natural numbers {{nowrap|{{math|(''n'', ''m'')}}}}, which determine the precise form of the transformation law. The ''{{vanchor|order}}'' of a tensor is the sum of these two numbers.

The order (also ''degree'' or ''{{vanchor|rank}}'') of a tensor is thus the sum of the orders of its arguments plus the order of the resulting tensor. This is also the dimensionality of the array of numbers needed to represent the tensor with respect to a specific basis, or equivalently, the number of indices needed to label each component in that array.  For example in a fixed basis, a standard linear map that maps a vector to a vector, is represented by a matrix (a 2-dimensional array), and therefore is a 2nd-order tensor.  A simple vector can be represented as a 1-dimensional array, and is therefore a 1st-order tensor.  Scalars are simple numbers and are thus 0th-order tensors. This way the tensor representing the scalar product, taking two vectors and resulting in a scalar has order {{math|2 + 0 {{=}} 2}}, equal to the stress tensor, taking one vector and returning another {{math|1 + 1 {{=}} 2}}. The {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt; \varepsilon_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt;-symbol,}} mapping two vectors to one vector, would have order {{math|2 + 1 {{=}} 3.}}    

The collection of tensors on a vector space and its dual forms a [[tensor algebra]], which allows products of arbitrary tensors. Simple applications of tensors of order {{math|2}}, which can be represented as a square matrix, can be solved by clever arrangement of transposed vectors and by applying the rules of matrix multiplication, but the tensor product should not be confused with this.

Tensors are important in physics because they provide a concise mathematical framework for formulating and solving physics problems in areas such as [[mechanics]] ([[Stress (mechanics)|stress]], [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[fluid mechanics]], [[moment of inertia]], ...), [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]] ([[electromagnetic tensor]], [[Maxwell stress tensor|Maxwell tensor]], [[permittivity]], [[magnetic susceptibility]], ...), or [[general relativity]] ([[stress–energy tensor]], [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature tensor]], ... ) and others.  In applications, it is common to study situations in which a different tensor can occur at each point of an object; for example the stress within an object may vary from one location to another. This leads to the concept of a [[tensor field]]. In some areas, tensor fields are so ubiquitous that they are simply called "tensors". 

Tensors were conceived in 1900 by [[Tullio Levi-Civita]] and [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]], who continued the earlier work of [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[Elwin Bruno Christoffel]] and others, as part of the ''[[absolute differential calculus]]''.  The concept enabled an alternative formulation of the intrinsic [[differential geometry]] of a [[manifold]] in the form of the [[Riemann curvature tensor]].&lt;ref name="Kline"&gt;{{cite book|first=Morris |last=Kline|title=Mathematical Thought From Ancient to Modern Times: Volume 3|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-OsRDAAAQBAJ}}|date=March 1990|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-506137-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Although seemingly different, the various approaches to defining tensors describe the same geometric concept using different language and at different levels of abstraction.

===As multidimensional arrays===

A tensor may be represented as a (potentially multidimensional) array (although a multidimensional array is not necessarily a representation of a tensor, as [[Tensor#Holors|discussed below]] with regard to holors).  Just as a [[Vector space|vector]] in an {{mvar|n}}-[[dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] space is represented by a one-dimensional array of length {{mvar|n}} with respect to a given [[Basis (linear algebra)#Ordered bases and coordinates|basis]], any tensor with respect to a basis is represented by a multidimensional array.  For example, a [[linear operator]] is represented in a basis as a two-dimensional square {{math|''n'' × ''n''}} array.  The numbers in the multidimensional array are known as the ''scalar components'' of the tensor or simply its ''components''.  They are denoted by indices giving their position in the array, as [[subscript and superscript|subscripts and superscripts]], following the symbolic name of the tensor.  For example, the components of an order {{math|2}} tensor {{mvar|T}} could be denoted {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}}&amp;#8239;, where {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} are indices running from {{math|1}} to {{mvar|n}}, or also by {{math|''T''&amp;thinsp;{{su|b=''i''|p=''j''}}}}.  Whether an index is displayed as a superscript or subscript depends on the transformation properties of the tensor, described below. Thus while {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''T''&amp;thinsp;{{su|b=''i''|p=''j''}}}} can both be expressed as ''n'' by ''n'' matrices, and are numerically related via [[Raising_and_lowering_indices| index juggling]], the difference in their transformation laws indicates it would be improper to add them together. The total number of indices required to identify each component uniquely is equal to the [[Array data structure#Dimension|dimension]] of the array, and is called the ''order'', ''degree'' or ''rank'' of the tensor.  However, the term "rank" generally has [[tensor rank|another meaning]] in the context of matrices and tensors.

Just as the components of a vector change when we change the [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of the vector space, the components of a tensor also change under such a transformation.  Each type of tensor comes equipped with a ''transformation law'' that details how the components of the tensor respond to a [[change of basis]].  The components of a vector can respond in two distinct ways to a [[change of basis]] (see [[covariance and contravariance of vectors]]), where the new [[basis vectors]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{e}}_i&lt;/math&gt; are expressed in terms of the old basis vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}_j&lt;/math&gt; as,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{e}}_i = \sum_{j=1}^n \mathbf{e}_j R^j_i = \mathbf{e}_j R^j_i .&lt;/math&gt;

Here ''R''&lt;sup&gt;'' j''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are the entries of the change of basis matrix, and in the rightmost expression the summation sign was suppressed: this is the [[Einstein summation convention]], which will be used throughout this article.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The Einstein summation convention, in brief, requires the sum to be taken over all values of the index whenever the same symbol appears as a subscript and superscript in the same term.  For example, under this convention &lt;math&gt;B_iC^i = B_1C^1 + B_2C^2 + \cdots B_nC^n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The components ''v''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt; of a column vector '''v''' transform with the [[matrix inverse|inverse]] of the matrix ''R'',
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{v}^i = \left(R^{-1}\right)^i_j v^j,&lt;/math&gt;
where the hat denotes the components in the new basis.  This is called a ''contravariant'' transformation law, because the vector transforms by the ''inverse'' of the change of basis.  In contrast, the components, ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, of a covector (or row vector), '''w''' transform with the matrix ''R'' itself,
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{w}_i = w_j R^j_i .&lt;/math&gt;

This is called a ''covariant'' transformation law, because the covector transforms by the ''same matrix'' as the change of basis matrix.  The components of a more general tensor transform by some combination of covariant and contravariant transformations, with one transformation law for each index.  If the transformation matrix of an index is the inverse matrix of the basis transformation, then the index is called ''contravariant'' and is conventionally denoted with an upper index (superscript).  If the transformation matrix of an index is the basis transformation itself, then the index is called ''covariant'' and is denoted with a lower index (subscript). 

As a simple example, the matrix of a linear operator with respect to a basis is a rectangular array &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; that transforms under a change of basis matrix  &lt;math&gt;R = \left(R^j_i\right)&lt;/math&gt;  by  &lt;math&gt;\hat{T} = R^{-1}TR&lt;/math&gt;.  For the individual matrix entries, this transformation law has the form  &lt;math&gt;\hat{T}^{i'}_{j'} = \left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'}_i T^i_j R^j_{j'}&lt;/math&gt;  so the tensor corresponding to the matrix of a linear operator has one covariant and one contravariant index: it is of type (1,1). 

Combinations of covariant and contravariant components with the same index allow us to express geometric invariants. For example, the fact that a vector is the same object in different coordinate systems can be captured by the following equations, using the formulas defined above:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=\hat{v}^i \,\mathbf{\hat{e}}_i  = \left( \left(R^{-1}\right)^i_j  {v}^j \right)  \left( \mathbf{{e}}_k R^k_i \right) =\left( \left(R^{-1}\right)^i_j R^k_i \right) {v}^j   \mathbf{{e}}_k  = \delta_j^k {v}^j  \mathbf{{e}}_k  ={v}^k \,\mathbf{{e}}_k =
 {v}^i \,\mathbf{{e}}_i&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\delta^k_j&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]], which functions similarly to the [[identity matrix]], and has the effect of renaming indices (''j'' into ''k'' in this example). This shows several features of the component notation- the ability to re-arrange terms at will ([[commutativity]]), the need to use different indices when working with multiple objects in the same expression, the ability to rename indices, and the manner in which contravariant and covariant tensors combine so that all instances of the transformation matrix and its inverse cancel, so that expressions like &lt;math&gt;{v}^i \,\mathbf{{e}}_i&lt;/math&gt; can immediately be seen to be geometrically identical in all coordinate systems.

Similarly, a linear operator, viewed as a geometric object, does not actually depend on a basis: it is just a linear map that accepts a vector as an argument and produces another vector.  The transformation law for how the matrix of components of a linear operator changes with the basis is consistent with the transformation law for a contravariant vector, so that the action of a linear operator on a contravariant vector is represented in coordinates as the matrix product of their respective coordinate representations.  That is, the components  &lt;math&gt;(Tv)^i&lt;/math&gt;  are given by  &lt;math&gt;(Tv)^i = T^i_j v^j&lt;/math&gt;.  These components transform contravariantly, since
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\widehat{Tv}\right)^{i'} = \hat{T}^{i'}_{j'} \hat{v}^{j'} = \left[ \left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'}_i T^i_j R^j_{j'} \right] \left[ \left(R^{-1}\right)^{j'}_j v^j \right] = \left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'}_i (Tv)^i .&lt;/math&gt;

The transformation law for an order {{math|''p'' + ''q''}} tensor with ''p'' contravariant indices and ''q'' covariant indices is thus given as,
:&lt;math&gt;
  \hat{T}^{i'_1, \ldots, i'_p}_{j'_1, \ldots, j'_q} = \left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'_1}_{i_1} \cdots \left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'_p}_{i_p}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;
  T^{i_1, \ldots, i_p}_{j_1, \ldots, j_q}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;
  R^{j_1}_{j'_1}\cdots R^{j_q}_{j'_q}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Here the primed indices denote components in the new coordinates, and the unprimed indices denote the components in the old coordinates.  Such a tensor is said to be of order or ''type'' {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}}.  The terms "order", "type", "rank", "valence", and "degree" are all sometimes used for the same concept.  Here, the term "order" or "total order" will be used for the total dimension of the array (or its generalisation in other definitions), {{math|''p'' + ''q''}} in the preceding example, and the term "type" for the pair giving the number of contravariant and covariant indices.  A tensor of type {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} is also called a {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}}-tensor for short.

This discussion motivates the following formal definition:&lt;ref name="Sharpe2000"&gt;{{cite book|first=R.W. |last=Sharpe|title=Differential Geometry: Cartan's Generalization of Klein's Erlangen Program|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Ytqs4xU5QKAC| page=194}}|date=21 November 2000|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-387-94732-7| page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=WROiC9st58gC}}|first=Jan Arnoldus|last=Schouten|authorlink=Jan Arnoldus Schouten|title=Tensor analysis for physicists|year=1954|publisher = Courier Corporation|isbn = 9780486655826|chapter =Chapter II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|'''Definition.'''  A tensor of type (''p'', ''q'') is an assignment of a multidimensional array
:&lt;math&gt;T^{i_1\dots i_p}_{j_{1}\dots j_{q}}[\mathbf{f}]&lt;/math&gt;
to each basis {{math|'''f''' {{=}} ('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)}} of an ''n''-dimensional vector space such that, if we apply the change of basis
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f}\mapsto \mathbf{f}\cdot R = \left( \mathbf{e}_i R^i_1, \dots, \mathbf{e}_i R^i_n \right)&lt;/math&gt;
then the multidimensional array obeys the transformation law
:&lt;math&gt;
  T^{i'_1\dots i'_p}_{j'_1\dots j'_q}[\mathbf{f} \cdot R] = \left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'_1}_{i_1} \cdots \left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'_p}_{i_p}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;
  T^{i_1, \ldots, i_p}_{j_1, \ldots, j_q}[\mathbf{f}]
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;
  R^{j_1}_{j'_1}\cdots R^{j_q}_{j'_q} .
&lt;/math&gt;
}}

The definition of a tensor as a multidimensional array satisfying a transformation law traces back to the work of Ricci.&lt;ref name="Kline"/&gt;

An equivalent definition of a tensor uses the [[representation theory|representations]] of the [[general linear group]].  There is an [[group action|action]] of the general linear group on the set of all [[ordered basis|ordered bases]] of an ''n''-dimensional vector space.   If &lt;math&gt;\mathbf f=(\mathbf f_1,\dots,\mathbf f_n)&lt;/math&gt; is an ordered basis, and &lt;math&gt;R=(R^i_j)&lt;/math&gt; is an invertible &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix, then  the action is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf fR = (\mathbf f_iR^i_1,\dots,\mathbf f_iR^i_n).&lt;/math&gt;
Let ''F'' be the set of all ordered bases.  Then ''F'' is a [[principal homogeneous space]] for GL(''n'').  Let ''W'' be a vector space and let &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; be a representation of GL(''n'') on ''W'' (that is, a [[group homomorphism]] &lt;math&gt;\rho:\text{GL}(n)\to \text{GL}(W)&lt;/math&gt;).  Then a tensor of type &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equivariant map]] &lt;math&gt;T:F\to W&lt;/math&gt;.  Equivariance here means that
:&lt;math&gt;T(FR) = \rho(R^{-1})T(F).&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a [[tensor representation]] of the general linear group, this gives the usual definition of tensors as multidimensional arrays.  This definition is often used to describe tensors on manifolds,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1=Kobayashi|first1=Shoshichi|last2=Nomizu|first2=Katsumi | title = Foundations of Differential Geometry|volume=Vol. 1| publisher=[[Wiley Interscience]] | year=1996|edition=New|isbn=978-0-471-15733-5|title-link=Foundations of Differential Geometry}}&lt;/ref&gt; and readily generalizes to other groups.&lt;ref name="Sharpe2000"/&gt;

===As multilinear maps===
{{Main|Multilinear map}}
A downside to the definition of a tensor using the multidimensional array approach is that it is not apparent from the definition that the defined object is indeed basis independent, as is expected from an intrinsically geometric object.  Although it is possible to show that transformation laws indeed ensure independence from the basis, sometimes a more intrinsic definition is preferred.  One approach that is common in [[differential geometry]] is to define tensors relative to a fixed (finite-dimensional) vector space ''V'', which is usually taken to be a particular vector space of some geometrical significance like the [[tangent space]] to a manifold.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lee|first=John|title=Introduction to smooth manifolds|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4sGuQgAACAAJ|page=173}}|volume=|page=173|year=2000|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-387-95495-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this approach, a type {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}} tensor ''T'' is defined as a [[multilinear map]],
:&lt;math&gt; T: \underbrace{ V^* \times\dots\times V^*}_{p \text{ copies}} \times \underbrace{ V \times\dots\times V}_{q \text{ copies}} \rightarrow \mathbf{R}, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; is the corresponding [[dual space]] of covectors, which is linear in each of its arguments. The above assumes ''V'' is a vector space over the [[real number]]s, '''R'''. More generally, ''V'' can be taken over an arbitrary field of numbers, ''F'' (e.g. the [[complex number]]s) with a one-dimensional vector space over ''F'' replacing '''R''' as the codomain of the multilinear maps.

By applying a multilinear map ''T'' of type {{nowrap|(''p'', ''q'')}} to a basis {'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;} for ''V'' and a canonical cobasis {'''ε'''&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;} for ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;T^{i_1\dots i_p}_{j_1\dots j_q} \equiv T\left(\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{i_1}, \ldots,\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{i_p}, \mathbf{e}_{j_1}, \ldots, \mathbf{e}_{j_q}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
a {{nowrap|(''p'' + ''q'')}}-dimensional array of components can be obtained.  A different choice of basis will yield different components.  But, because ''T'' is linear in all of its arguments, the components satisfy the tensor transformation law used in the multilinear array definition.  The multidimensional array of components of ''T'' thus form a tensor according to that definition.  Moreover, such an array can be realized as the components of some multilinear map ''T''.  This motivates viewing multilinear maps as the intrinsic objects underlying tensors.

In viewing a tensor as a multilinear map, it is conventional to identify the [[double dual]] ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗∗&lt;/sup&gt; of the vector space ''V'', i.e., the space of linear functionals on the dual  vector space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;, with the vector space ''V''.  There is always a [[Dual space#Injection into the double-dual|natural linear map]] from ''V'' to its double dual, given by evaluating a linear form in ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; against a vector in ''V''.  This linear mapping is an isomorphism in finite dimensions, and it is often then expedient to identify ''V'' with its double dual.

===Using tensor products===
{{Main|Tensor (intrinsic definition)}}
For some mathematical applications, a more abstract approach is sometimes useful.  This can be achieved by defining tensors in terms of elements of [[tensor product]]s of vector spaces, which in turn are defined through a [[universal property]].  A type {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} tensor is defined in this context as an element of the tensor product of vector spaces,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dodson|first=CTJ|title=Tensor geometry|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/344640179/Dodson-Poston-Tensor-Geometry-pdf|volume=130|year=1991|series=GTM|publisher=Springer|last2=Poston |first2=T |p= 105}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Springer|id=a/a011120|title=Affine tensor}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T\in \underbrace{V \otimes\dots\otimes V}_{p\text{ copies}} \otimes \underbrace{V^* \otimes\dots\otimes V^*}_{q \text{ copies}}.&lt;/math&gt;

A basis {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{math|''V''}} and basis {{math|''w''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{math|''W''}} naturally induce a basis {{math|''v''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊗ ''w''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;}} of the tensor product {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}}.  The components of a tensor {{math|''T''}} are the coefficients of the tensor with respect to the basis obtained from a basis {{math|&lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} for {{math|''V''}} and its dual basis {{math|&lt;nowiki&gt;{&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''ε'''&lt;sup&gt;''j''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;T = T^{i_1\dots i_p}_{j_1\dots j_q}\; \mathbf{e}_{i_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes \mathbf{e}_{i_p}\otimes \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{j_1}\otimes\cdots\otimes \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}^{j_q}.&lt;/math&gt;
Using the properties of the tensor product, it can be shown that these components satisfy the transformation law for a type {{math|(''p'', ''q'')}} tensor.  Moreover, the universal property of the tensor product gives a [[bijection|{{math|1}}-to-{{math|1}} correspondence]] between tensors defined in this way and tensors defined as multilinear maps.

Tensor products can be defined in great generality&amp;nbsp;– for example, [[tensor product of modules|involving arbitrary modules]] over a ring.  In principle, one could define a "tensor" simply to be an element of any tensor product.  However, the mathematics literature usually reserves the term ''tensor'' for an element of a tensor product of any number of copies of a single vector space {{math|''V''}} and its dual, as above.

===Tensors in infinite dimensions===
This discussion of tensors so far assumes finite dimensionality of the spaces involved, where the spaces of tensors obtained by each of these constructions are [[naturally isomorphic]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The [[Dual space#Injection into the double-dual|double duality isomorphism]], for instance, is used to identify ''V'' with the double dual space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗∗&lt;/sup&gt;, which consists of multilinear forms of degree one on ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;.  It is typical in linear algebra to identify spaces that are naturally isomorphic, treating them as the same space.&lt;/ref&gt;  Constructions of spaces of tensors based on the tensor product and multilinear mappings can be generalized, essentially without modification, to [[vector bundle]]s or [[coherent sheaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=N. |last=Bourbaki|title=Algebra I: Chapters 1-3|chapter=3|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=STS9aZ6F204C}}|date=3 August 1998|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-540-64243-5}} where the case of finitely generated projective modules is treated.  The global sections of sections of a vector bundle over a compact space form a projective module over the ring of smooth functions.  All statements for coherent sheaves are true locally.&lt;/ref&gt;  For infinite-dimensional vector spaces, inequivalent topologies lead to inequivalent notions of tensor, and these various isomorphisms may or may not hold depending on what exactly is meant by a tensor (see [[topological tensor product]]).  In some applications, it is the [[tensor product of Hilbert spaces]] that is intended, whose properties are the most similar to the finite-dimensional case. A more modern view is that it is the tensors' structure as a [[symmetric monoidal category]] that encodes their most important properties, rather than the specific models of those categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S0001870883710558/1-s2.0-S0001870883710558-main.pdf?_tid=7ce22fc2-ba5b-11e7-ac12-00000aab0f6b&amp;acdnat=1509028956_4fe3288701e5c7983c40dd029aaf0385 |title= Braided tensor categories |first1= A |last1=Joyal |first2= Ross |last2=Street |journal= Advances in Mathematics |year=1993 |volume=102 |pages= 20–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tensor fields===
{{Main|Tensor field}}
In many applications, especially in differential geometry and physics, it is natural to consider a tensor with components that are functions of the point in a space.  This was the setting of Ricci's original work.  In modern mathematical terminology such an object is called a [[tensor field]], often referred to simply as a tensor.&lt;ref name="Kline"/&gt;

In this context, a [[coordinate basis]] is often chosen for the [[tangent space|tangent vector space]].  The transformation law may then be expressed in terms of [[partial derivative]]s of the coordinate functions,
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{x}^i\left(x^1, \ldots, x^n\right),&lt;/math&gt;
defining a coordinate transformation,&lt;ref name="Kline"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  \hat{T}^{i'_1\dots i'_p}_{j'_1\dots j'_q}\left(\bar{x}^1, \ldots, \bar{x}^n\right) =
  \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{i'_1}}{\partial x^{i_1}}
  \cdots
  \frac{\partial \bar{x}^{i'_p}}{\partial x^{i_p}}
  \frac{\partial x^{j_1}}{\partial \bar{x}^{j'_1}}
  \cdots
  \frac{\partial x^{j_q}}{\partial \bar{x}^{j'_q}}
  T^{i_1\dots i_p}_{j_1\dots j_q}\left(x^1, \ldots, x^n\right).
&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
{{see also|Dyadic tensor}}
&lt;!--NOTE: "Dyadic" is old terminology for matrix representations of rank-2 tensors which could be any of {{math|(2, 0)}}, {{math|(1, 1)}} or {{math|(0, 2)}} (which clashes with bilinear forms, inner products, metric etc.)&amp;nbsp;– its meaning is vague, unclear and confusing, and they aren't really used anymore.  Please do not add "dyadic tensor" to the table.  Thanks. --&gt;

This table shows important examples of tensors on vector spaces and tensor fields on manifolds.  The tensors are classified according to their type {{math|(''n'', ''m'')}}, where ''n'' is the number of contravariant indices, ''m'' is the number of covariant indices, and {{math|''n'' + ''m''}} gives the total order of the tensor.  For example, a [[bilinear form]] is the same thing as a {{math|(0, 2)}}-tensor; an [[inner product]] is an example of a {{math|(0, 2)}}-tensor, but not all {{math|(0, 2)}}-tensors are inner products.  In the {{math|(0, ''M'')}}-entry of the table, ''M'' denotes the dimensionality of the underlying vector space or manifold because for each dimension of the space, a separate index is needed to select that dimension to get a maximally covariant antisymmetric tensor.

Raising an index on an {{math|(''n'', ''m'')}}-tensor produces an {{math|(''n'' + 1, ''m'' − 1)}}-tensor; this corresponds to moving diagonally down and to the left on the table.  Symmetrically, lowering an index corresponds to moving diagonally up and to the right on the table.  [[#Contraction|Contraction]] of an upper with a lower index of an {{math|(''n'', ''m'')}}-tensor produces an {{math|(''n'' − 1, ''m'' − 1)}}-tensor; this corresponds to moving diagonally up and to the left on the table.

==Notation==

There are several notational systems that are used to describe tensors and perform calculations involving them. 

===Ricci calculus===

[[Ricci calculus]] is the modern formalism and notation for tensor indices: indicating [[inner product|inner]] and [[outer product]]s, [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariance and contravariance]], [[summation]]s of tensor components, [[symmetric tensor|symmetry]] and [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetry]], and [[partial derivative|partial]] and [[covariant derivative]]s.

===Einstein summation convention===

The [[Einstein summation convention]] dispenses with writing [[summation sign]]s, leaving the summation implicit.  Any repeated index symbol is summed over: if the index {{mvar|i}} is used twice in a given term of a tensor expression, it means that the term is to be summed for all {{mvar|i}}.  Several distinct pairs of indices may be summed this way.

===Penrose graphical notation===

[[Penrose graphical notation]] is a diagrammatic notation which replaces the symbols for tensors with shapes, and their indices by lines and curves.  It is independent of basis elements, and requires no symbols for the indices.

===Abstract index notation===

The [[abstract index notation]] is a way to write tensors such that the indices are no longer thought of as numerical, but rather are [[Indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]]s.  This notation captures the expressiveness of indices and the basis-independence of index-free notation.

===Component-free notation===

A [[component-free treatment of tensors]] uses notation that emphasises that tensors do not rely on any basis, and is defined in terms of the [[Tensor product#Tensor product of vector spaces|tensor product of vector spaces]].

==Operations==
There are several operations on tensors that again produce a tensor.  The linear nature of tensor implies that two tensors of the same type may be added together, and that tensors may be multiplied by a scalar with results analogous to the [[Scalar multiplication|scaling of a vector]].  On components, these operations are simply performed component-wise.  These operations do not change the type of the tensor; but there are also operations that produce a tensor of different type.

===Tensor product===
{{Main|Tensor product}}

The [[tensor product]] takes two tensors, ''S'' and ''T'', and produces a new tensor, {{nowrap|{{math|''S'' ⊗ ''T''}}}}, whose order is the sum of the orders of the original tensors.  When described as multilinear maps, the tensor product simply multiplies the two tensors, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;(S\otimes T)(v_1,\ldots, v_n, v_{n+1},\ldots, v_{n+m}) = S(v_1,\ldots, v_n)T( v_{n+1},\ldots, v_{n+m}),&lt;/math&gt;

which again produces a map that is linear in all its arguments.  On components, the effect is to multiply the components of the two input tensors pairwise, i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;(S\otimes T)^{i_1\ldots i_l i_{l+1}\ldots i_{l+n}}_{j_1\ldots j_k j_{k+1}\ldots j_{k+m}} =
S^{i_1\ldots i_l}_{j_1\ldots j_k} T^{i_{l+1}\ldots i_{l+n}}_{j_{k+1}\ldots j_{k+m}},&lt;/math&gt;

If {{mvar|S}} is of type {{math|(''l'', ''k'')}} and {{mvar|T}} is of type {{math|(''n'', ''m'')}}, then the tensor product {{nowrap|{{math|''S'' ⊗ ''T''}}}} has type {{nowrap|{{math|(''l'' + ''n'', ''k'' + ''m'')}}}}.

===Contraction===
{{Main|Tensor contraction}}

[[Tensor contraction]] is an operation that reduces a type {{nowrap|(''n'', ''m'')}} tensor to a type {{nowrap|(''n'' − 1, ''m'' − 1)}} tensor, of which the [[trace (mathematics)|trace]] is a special case. It thereby reduces the total order of a tensor by two. The operation is achieved by summing components for which one specified contravariant index is the same as one specified covariant index to produce a new component. Components for which those two indices are different are discarded. For example, a {{nowrap|(1, 1)}}-tensor &lt;math&gt;T_i^j&lt;/math&gt; can be contracted to a scalar through
:&lt;math&gt;T_i^i&lt;/math&gt;.
Where the summation is again implied.  When the {{nowrap|(1, 1)}}-tensor is interpreted as a linear map, this operation is known as the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]].

The contraction is often used in conjunction with the tensor product to contract an index from each tensor.

The contraction can also be understood using the definition of a tensor as an element of a tensor product of copies of the space ''V'' with the space ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; by first decomposing the tensor into a linear combination of simple tensors, and then applying a factor from ''V''&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; to a factor from ''V''.  For example, a tensor
:&lt;math&gt;T \in V\otimes V\otimes V^*&lt;/math&gt;
can be written as a linear combination
:&lt;math&gt;T=v_1\otimes w_1\otimes \alpha_1 + v_2\otimes w_2\otimes \alpha_2 +\cdots + v_N\otimes w_N\otimes \alpha_N.&lt;/math&gt;
The contraction of ''T'' on the first and last slots is then the vector
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha_1(v_1)w_1 + \alpha_2(v_2)w_2+\cdots+\alpha_N(v_N)w_N.&lt;/math&gt;

In a vector space with an [[inner product]] (also known as a [[Metric tensor|metric]]) ''g'', the term [[Tensor contraction#Metric contraction|contraction]] is used for removing two contravariant or two covariant indices by forming a trace with the metric tensor or its inverse.  For example, a {{nowrap|(2, 0)}}-tensor &lt;math&gt;T^{ij} &lt;/math&gt; can be contracted to a scalar through
:&lt;math&gt;T^{ij} g_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;
(yet again assuming the summation convention).

===Raising or lowering an index===
{{Main|Raising and lowering indices}}
When a vector space is equipped with a [[nondegenerate bilinear form]] (or ''[[metric tensor]]'' as it is often called in this context), operations can be defined that convert a contravariant (upper) index into a covariant (lower) index and vice versa.  A metric tensor is a (symmetric) ({{nowrap|0, 2)}}-tensor; it is thus possible to contract an upper index of a tensor with one of the lower indices of the metric tensor in the product.  This produces a new tensor with the same index structure as the previous tensor, but with lower index generally shown in the same position of the contracted upper index.  This operation is quite graphically known as ''lowering an index''.

Conversely, the inverse operation can be defined, and is called ''raising an index''.  This is equivalent to a similar contraction on the product with a {{nowrap|(2, 0)}}-tensor.  This ''inverse metric tensor'' has components that are the matrix inverse of those of the metric tensor.

==Applications==

===Continuum mechanics===

Important examples are provided by [[continuum mechanics]].  The stresses inside a [[solid body]] or [[fluid]] are described by a tensor field.  The [[Stress (mechanics)|stress tensor]] and [[strain tensor]] are both second-order tensor fields, and are related in a general linear elastic material by a fourth-order [[elasticity tensor|elasticity tensor field]].  In detail, the tensor quantifying stress in a 3-dimensional solid object has components that can be conveniently represented as a 3 × 3 array.  The three faces of a cube-shaped infinitesimal volume segment of the solid are each subject to some given force.  The force's vector components are also three in number.  Thus, 3 × 3, or 9 components are required to describe the stress at this cube-shaped infinitesimal segment.  Within the bounds of this solid is a whole mass of varying stress quantities, each requiring 9 quantities to describe.  Thus, a second-order tensor is needed.

If a particular [[Volume form|surface element]] inside the material is singled out, the material on one side of the surface will apply a force on the other side.  In general, this force will not be orthogonal to the surface, but it will depend on the orientation of the surface in a linear manner.  This is described by a tensor of [[type of a tensor|type {{nowrap|(2, 0)}}]], in [[linear elasticity]], or more precisely by a tensor field of type {{nowrap|(2, 0)}}, since the stresses may vary from point to point.

===Other examples from physics===
Common applications include

* [[Electromagnetic tensor]] (or Faraday tensor) in [[electromagnetism]]
* [[Finite deformation tensors]] for describing deformations and [[strain tensor]] for [[Strain (materials science)|strain]] in [[continuum mechanics]]
* [[Permittivity]] and [[electric susceptibility]] are tensors in [[anisotropic]] media
* [[Four-tensors]] in [[general relativity]] (e.g. [[stress–energy tensor]]), used to represent [[momentum]] [[flux]]es
* Spherical tensor operators are the eigenfunctions of the quantum [[angular momentum operator]] in [[spherical coordinates]]
* Diffusion tensors, the basis of [[diffusion tensor imaging]], represent rates of diffusion in biologic environments
* [[Quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum computing]] utilise tensor products for combination of quantum states

===Applications of tensors of order &gt; 2===
The concept of a tensor of order two is often conflated with that of a matrix.  Tensors of higher order do however capture ideas important in science and engineering, as has been shown successively in numerous areas as they develop.  This happens, for instance, in the field of [[computer vision]], with the [[trifocal tensor]] generalizing the [[fundamental matrix (computer vision)|fundamental matrix]].

The field of [[nonlinear optics]] studies the changes to material [[Polarization density#Relation between P and E in various materials|polarization density]] under extreme electric fields.  The polarization waves generated are related to the generating [[electric field]]s through the nonlinear susceptibility tensor.  If the polarization '''P''' is not linearly proportional to the electric field '''E''', the medium is termed ''nonlinear''.  To a good approximation (for sufficiently weak fields, assuming no permanent dipole moments are present), '''P''' is given by a [[Taylor series]] in '''E''' whose coefficients are the nonlinear susceptibilities:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{P_i}{\varepsilon_0} = \sum_j  \chi^{(1)}_{ij} E_j  +  \sum_{jk} \chi_{ijk}^{(2)} E_j E_k + \sum_{jk\ell} \chi_{ijk\ell}^{(3)} E_j E_k E_\ell  + \cdots. \!&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\chi^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; is the linear susceptibility, &lt;math&gt;\chi^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt; gives the [[Pockels effect]] and  [[second harmonic generation]], and &lt;math&gt;\chi^{(3)}&lt;/math&gt; gives the [[Kerr effect]].  This expansion shows the way higher-order tensors arise naturally in the subject matter.

==Generalizations==

===Holors===

As discussed above, a tensor can be represented as a (potentially multidimensional, multi-indexed) array of quantities. To distinguish tensors (when denoted as tensorial arrays of quantities with respect to a fixed basis) from arbitrary arrays of quantities the term [[Parry_Moon#Holors|''holor'']] was coined for the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Moon
 | first = Parry Hiram
 | author-link1 = Parry Moon
 | last2 = Spencer
 | first2 = Domina Eberle
 | author-link2 = Domina Eberle Spencer 
 | title = Theory of Holors: A Generalization of Tensors
 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]
 | date = 1986
 | isbn = 978-0-521-01900-2
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

So tensors can be analyzed as a particular type of holor, alongside other not strictly tensorial holors, such as neural network (node and/or link) values, indexed inventory tables, and so on. Another group of holors that transform like tensors up to a so called ''weight'', derived from the transformation equations, are the [[tensor density|tensor densities]], e.g. the Levi-Civita Symbol. The [[Christoffel symbols]] also belong to the holors.

The term ''holor'' is not in widespread use, and unfortunately the word "tensor" is often misused when referring to the multidimensional array representation of a holor, causing confusion regarding the strict meaning of ''tensor''. 

The concept of holors and the associated terminology provide an algebra and calculus for holors in a more general setting than what is seen for tensorial arrays.

===Tensor products of vector spaces===
The vector spaces of a [[tensor product]] need not be the same, and sometimes the elements of such a more general tensor product are called "tensors".  For example, an element of the tensor product space {{math|''V'' ⊗ ''W''}} is a second-order "tensor" in this more general sense,&lt;ref name="Maia2011"&gt;{{cite book|first=M. D. |last=Maia|title=Geometry of the Fundamental Interactions: On Riemann's Legacy to High Energy Physics and Cosmology|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=wEWw_vGBDW8C|page=48}}
|year=2011|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-8273-5|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an order-{{math|''d''}} tensor may likewise be defined as an element of a tensor product of {{math|''d''}} different vector spaces.&lt;ref name="Hogben2013"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Er7MBQAAQBAJ|page=7}}|title=Handbook of Linear Algebra, Second Edition|last=|first=|publisher=CRC Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-4665-0729-6|editor-last=Hogben|editor-first=Leslie|edition=2nd|location=|pages=15–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A type {{math|(''n'', ''m'')}} tensor, in the sense defined previously, is also a tensor of order {{math|''n'' + ''m''}} in this more general sense.  The concept of tensor product [[tensor product of modules|can be extended]] to arbitrary [[module over a ring|modules over a ring]].

===Tensors in infinite dimensions===
The notion of a tensor can be generalized in a variety of ways to [[Dimension (vector space)|infinite dimensions]].  One, for instance, is via the [[tensor product of Hilbert spaces|tensor product]] of [[Hilbert space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Segal | first1 = I. E. | last2 =  | first2 =  | date=January 1956 | title = Tensor Algebras Over Hilbert Spaces. I | journal = Transactions of the American Mathematical Society | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 106–134 | jstor = 1992855 | doi = 10.2307/1992855 | url =  | format =  | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another way of generalizing the idea of tensor, common in [[Nonlinear system|nonlinear analysis]], is via the [[#As multilinear maps|multilinear maps definition]] where instead of using finite-dimensional vector spaces and their [[algebraic dual]]s, one uses infinite-dimensional [[Banach space]]s and their [[continuous dual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Tensor densities===
{{main|Tensor density}}
Suppose that a homogeneous medium fills {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, so that the density of the medium is described by a single [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] value {{math|&amp;rho;}} in {{math|kg m&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  The mass, in kg, of a region {{math|&amp;Omega;}} is obtained by multiplying {{math|&amp;rho;}} by the volume of the region {{math|&amp;Omega;}}, or equivalently integrating the constant {{math|&amp;rho;}} over the region:
:&lt;math&gt;m=\int_\Omega \rho\, dx\,dy\,dz&lt;/math&gt;
where the Cartesian coordinates {{math|''xyz''}} are measured in m.  If the units of length are changed into cm, then the numerical values of the coordinate functions must be rescaled by a factor of 100:
:&lt;math&gt;x'=100 x,\quad y'=100y,\quad z'=100z&lt;/math&gt;
The numerical value of the density {{math|&amp;rho;}} must then also transform by &lt;math&gt;100^{-3}m^3/cm^3&lt;/math&gt; to compensate, so that the numerical value of the mass in kg is still given by integral of &lt;math&gt;\rho\, dx\,dy\,dz&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus &lt;math&gt;\rho'=100^{-3}\rho&lt;/math&gt; (in units of {{math|kg cm&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}).

More generally, if the Cartesian coordinates {{math|''xyz''}} undergo a linear transformation, then the numerical value of the density {{math|&amp;rho;}} must change by a factor of the reciprocal of the absolute value of the [[determinant]] of the coordinate transformation, so that the integral remains invariant, by the [[change of variables formula]] for integration. Such a quantity that scales by the reciprocal of the absolute value of the determinant of the coordinate transition map is called a [[scalar density]].  To model a non-constant density, {{math|&amp;rho;}} is a function of the variables {{math|''xyz''}} (a [[scalar field]]), and under a curvilinear change of coordinates, it transforms by the reciprocal of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] of the coordinate change. For more on the intrinsic meaning, see [[Density on a manifold]].

A tensor density transforms like a tensor under a coordinate change, except that it in addition picks up a factor of the absolute value of the determinant of the coordinate transition:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jan Arnoldus|last=Schouten|authorlink=Jan Arnoldus Schouten|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=WROiC9st58gC}}|title=Tensor analysis for physicists}}, §II.8: Densities.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  T^{i'_1\dots i'_p}_{j'_1\dots j'_q}[\mathbf{f} \cdot R] = |\det R|^{-w}\left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'_1}_{i_1} \cdots \left(R^{-1}\right)^{i'_p}_{i_p}
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;
  T^{i_1, \ldots, i_p}_{j_1, \ldots, j_q}[\mathbf{f}]
&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;
  R^{j_1}_{j'_1}\cdots R^{j_q}_{j'_q} .
&lt;/math&gt;
Here ''w'' is called the weight.  In general, any tensor multiplied by a power of this function or its absolute value is called a tensor density, or a weighted tensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Applications of tensor analysis|first=AJ |last=McConnell|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ZCP0AwAAQBAJ}}|publisher=Dover|year=1957|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kay|1988|p=27}} An example of a tensor density is the [[current density]] of [[electromagnetism]].

Under an affine transformation of the coordinates, a tensor transforms by the linear part of the transformation itself (or its inverse) on each index.  These come from the [[rational representation]]s of the general linear group.  But this is not quite the most general linear transformation law that such an object may have: tensor densities are non-rational, but are still [[semisimple]] representations.  A further class of transformations come from the logarithmic representation of the general linear group, a reducible but not semisimple representation,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Peter |last=Olver|title=Equivalence, invariants, and symmetry|url=
{{google books |plainurl=y |id=YuTzf61HILAC|page=77}}|page=77|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of an {{math|(''x'',''y'') &amp;isin; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} with the transformation law
:&lt;math&gt;(x,y)\mapsto (x+y\log|\det R|,y).&lt;/math&gt;

===Geometric objects===
The transformation law for a tensor behaves as a [[functor]] on the category of admissible coordinate systems, under general linear transformations (or, other transformations within some class, such as [[local diffeomorphism]]s.)  This makes a tensor a special case of a geometrical object, in the technical sense that it is a function of the coordinate system transforming functorially under coordinate changes.&lt;ref&gt;Haantjes, J., &amp; [[Gerard Laman|Laman, G.]] (1953). On the definition of geometric objects. I.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of objects obeying more general kinds of transformation laws are [[jet (mathematics)|jets]] and, more generally still, [[natural bundle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Albert|last=Nijenhuis|authorlink=Albert Nijenhuis|url=http://www.mathunion.org/ICM/ICM1958/Main/icm1958.0463.0469.ocr.pdf|chapter=Geometric aspects of formal differential operations on tensor fields|title= Proc.

===Spinors===
{{Main|Spinor}}
When changing from one [[orthonormal basis]] (called a ''frame'') to another by a rotation, the components of a tensor transform by that same rotation.  This transformation does not depend on the path taken through the space of frames.  However, the space of frames is not [[simply connected]] (see [[orientation entanglement]] and [[plate trick]]): there are continuous paths in the space of frames with the same beginning and ending configurations that are not deformable one into the other.  It is possible to attach an additional discrete invariant to each frame that incorporates this path dependence, and which turns out (locally) to have values of ±1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The road to reality: a complete guide to the laws of our universe|url=

Succinctly, spinors are elements of the [[spin representation]] of the rotation group, while tensors are elements of its [[tensor representation]]s.  Other [[classical groups]] have tensor representations, and so also tensors that are compatible with the group, but all non-compact classical groups have infinite-dimensional unitary representations as well.

==History==
The concepts of later tensor analysis arose from the work of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in differential geometry, and the formulation was much influenced by the theory of [[algebraic form]]s and invariants developed during the middle of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[We therefore want [our presentation] to be based only on [the assumption that] conditions of the type described occur during stresses and strains of non-rigid bodies, and therefore call them "tensorial" but call the characteristic physical quantities for them "tensors".]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensor calculus was developed around 1890 by [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] under the title ''absolute differential calculus'', and originally presented by Ricci in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was made accessible to many mathematicians by the publication of Ricci and [[Tullio Levi-Civita]]'s 1900 classic text ''Méthodes de calcul différentiel absolu et leurs applications'' (Methods of absolute differential calculus and their applications).{{sfn|Ricci|Levi-Civita|1900}}

In the 20th century, the subject came to be known as ''tensor analysis'', and achieved broader acceptance with the introduction of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]], around 1915.  General relativity is formulated completely in the language of tensors.  Einstein had learned about them, with great difficulty, from the geometer [[Marcel Grossmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=U2mO4nUunuwC}}
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Levi-Civita then initiated a correspondence with Einstein to correct mistakes Einstein had made in his use of tensor analysis.  The correspondence lasted 1915–17, and was characterized by mutual respect:

Tensors were also found to be useful in other fields such as [[continuum mechanics]].  Some well-known examples of tensors in [[differential geometry]] are [[quadratic form]]s such as [[metric tensor]]s, and the [[Riemann curvature tensor]].  The [[exterior algebra]] of [[Hermann Grassmann]], from the middle of the nineteenth century, is itself a tensor theory, and highly geometric, but it was some time before it was seen, with the theory of [[differential form]]s, as naturally unified with tensor calculus.  The work of [[Élie Cartan]] made differential forms one of the basic kinds of tensors used in mathematics.

From about the 1920s onwards, it was realised that tensors play a basic role in [[algebraic topology]] (for example in the [[Künneth theorem]]).&lt;ref name="Spanier2012"&gt;{{cite book|first=Edwin H. |last=Spanier|title=Algebraic Topology|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=iKx3BQAAQBAJ&amp;|page=227}}|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4684-9322-1|pages=227|quote=the  Künneth formula expressing the homology of the tensor product...}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Correspondingly there are types of tensors at work in many branches of [[abstract algebra]], particularly in [[homological algebra]] and [[representation theory]].  Multilinear algebra can be developed in greater generality than for scalars coming from a [[field (mathematics)|field]].  For example, scalars can come from a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]].  But the theory is then less geometric and computations more technical and less algorithmic.&lt;ref name="Hungerford2003"&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas W. |last=Hungerford|authorlink=Thomas W.

Inmates included [[Mustafa Setmariam Nasar]], and [[Riduan Isamuddin]] was held there before being transferred to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]]. The United Kingdom government, who lease the island to the US, denied any knowledge of the incident, saying that two prisoners had passed through Diego Garcia but the plane they were on had only stopped to refuel. Nasar's location is still unknown since his arrival on Diego Garcia was announced in Spanish newspaper ''[[El Pais]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://elpais.com/diario/2008/05/18/domingo/1211082753_850215.html|title=Reportaje - Un 'yihadista' en el limbo|first=Ediciones El|last=País|date=18 May 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| quote       = Given the weight of evidence proving that Diego Garcia was — at the very least — a key staging post in the U.S. rendition and torture programme, it had been widely expected to feature in the dossier, thus exposing Britain’s involvement beyond doubt. That the island was not mentioned once in almost 500 heavily redacted pages has merely heightened suspicion of an MI6-orchestrated cover-up.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
David Jones, writing in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', expressed surprise that Diego Garcia went entirely unmentioned on every page of the unclassified summary, and speculated that pressure from UK security agencies caused the portions of the report that covered CIA prisoner facilities on the island to remain classified.

{{terrorism|Jihad=muslim affiliated groups}}{{More citations needed|date=May 2018}}
A '''terrorist training camp''' is a facility established to train individuals in the ways of [[terrorism]], often without the consent of the trainees.{{fact|date=July 2018}} By teaching them the methods and tactics of [[terrorism]], those conducting such facilities aim to create an "army" of individuals who will do their bidding. They are often located in, but not confined to, regions where it is intended that acts of terrorism will be carried out, or in traditional areas of extremism, such as [[Pakistan]], [[Afghan training camp|Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="AFGHANISTAN"&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/200207/12/eng20020712_99617.shtml 4000 Britons trained at terror camps in Afghanistan]: Paper The People's Daily, July 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4841170.stm Is Somalia next for 'war on terror'?] BBC News. 7 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Wide-open spaces such as parks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1768396,001302420000.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195944/http://www.hindustantimes.com/news/181_1768396,001302420000.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt; and wilderness areas&lt;ref&gt;CBS News May 26, 2004: [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/27/terror/main620045.shtml U.S.: Cleric Eyed Ore. Terror Camp]&lt;/ref&gt; are common sites for these camps.

== Locations ==
Most camps are located in the Middle East, with the most infamous in [[Syria]] and the Arabian peninsula.{{fact|date=July 2018}} Many camps are located in regions of conflict. The call to [[jihad]] has seen many Muslims enter such camps, followed by US drone strikes.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==Purpose==
These encampments provide recruits with weapons training, protocol training, interaction with skilled veterans, and a secure geographic location for operations. Recruits are regularly indoctrinated in the goals and beliefs of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/terrorist-indoctrination-turning-people-killers-norman |author1=Lihou Dr. Norman T. Lihou |date=25 January 2015 |title=Terrorist Indoctrination Turning People into Killers |website=LinkedIn|accessdate=20 June 2017}}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational leaders attempt to isolate recruits from their outside social connections and force them to establish a new identity.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} This allows the organization to become the “family” of the recruit and generate loyalty to the organization’s goals.

== Psychological traits ==
Depending on the type of organization, the religion and “strength of faith” of the recruit is often an indicator of their status within the organization. Those who are not willing to comply, even after completion of training, are often punished and undergo training to strengthen their observance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Terrorist recruits are tested on knowledge of their religion and of rival groups. Recruiters do this to verify that each recruit has the necessary beliefs, which ensures organizational unification. Religious verification ensures that each member is working towards mutual goals.&lt;ref name="Understanding terrorism"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/11/terrorism.aspx |title=Understanding Terrorism |last=DeAngelis |first=Tori |date=November 2009|website=American Psychological Association |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109122812/http://www.apa.org/monitor/2009/11/terrorism.aspx|archive-date=2010-01-09|deadurl=yes |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recruiters use techniques that exploit or create mental trauma in order to produce a dissociated mindset in recruits — a condition in which the identity and awareness of the recruit is reset.&lt;ref name="Understanding terrorism"/&gt; Typical recruits look to join terrorist organizations because they are angry, alienated and/or disenfranchised.{{fact|date=July 2018}} Common thought processes include: believing that their current political involvement does not give them the power to effect change; identifying with perceived victims of the perceived social injustice they are fighting; feeling the need to take action; believing that violence is not immoral; having friends or family sympathetic to the cause; and craving social and psychological rewards such as adventure, camaraderie, and a heightened sense of identity.{{fact|date=July 2018}} Internet and cyber-skills are sought after as technically knowledgeable recruits can help the organization.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

== Examples of physical demands ==
Many terrorist organizations train recruits in [[guerrilla warfare]]. Recruits must be in shape in order to learn these tactics. An [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] workout video shows that cardiovascular fitness is important.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://domesticity.gawker.com/a-fitness-critique-of-the-isis-terrorist-workout-video-1593208538|title=A Fitness Critique of the ISIS Terrorist Workout Video|last=Nolan|first=Hamilton|date=19 June 2014|website=Domesticity|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recruits often train in full uniform, with weapons in hand. Recruits need to be able to survive in their environment with little nourishment. Recruits learn that if success is not attained, they will not be rescued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Terrorist Training Centers Around the World|last=Forest|first=James|publisher=Praeger Security International|year=2006|isbn=|location=Westport, Conn.|pages=296–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tonya Maxene Price''' (née '''Harding'''; born November 12, 1970) is a retired American [[figure skating|figure skater]].

A native of [[Portland, Oregon]], Harding was raised primarily by her mother, who enrolled her in ice skating lessons beginning at age four. Harding would spend much of her early life training, eventually dropping out of high school to devote her time to the sport. After climbing the ranks in the [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] between 1986 and 1989, Harding won the 1989 [[Skate America]] competition. She was the 1991 and 1994 U.S. champion before being stripped of her 1994 title, and 1991 [[1991 World Figure Skating Championships|World silver medalist]]. In 1991, she earned distinction as being the first American woman to successfully land a triple [[Axel jump|Axel]] in competition, and the second woman to do so in history (behind [[Midori Ito]]). She is also a two-time Olympian and a two-time Skate America Champion.

In January 1994, Harding became embroiled in controversy when her ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, orchestrated an attack on fellow US Olympian [[Nancy Kerrigan]]. After the [[1994 Winter Olympics]], Harding ultimately pleaded guilty to hindering the prosecution on March 16 and was banned for life on June 30, 1994 from the [[U.S. Figure Skating Association]].

In the early 2000s, Harding competed as a [[professional boxer]], and her life has been the subject of numerous films, documentaries, books, and academic studies. In 2014, two [[Television documentary|documentary television films]] about Harding's life and skating career (''Nancy &amp; Tonya'' and ''The Price of Gold'') were aired within two months of each other — inspiring [[Steven Rogers (screenwriter)|Steven Rogers]] to write the [[Black comedy|darkly comedic]] [[biographical film]] ''[[I, Tonya]]'', released in 2017 and starring [[Margot Robbie]] as Harding. In 2018, she was a contestant on [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 26)|season 26]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', finishing in third place.

== Early life ==
[[File:Ice chalet lloyd center portland oregon lec by andrew parodi.jpeg|thumb|Right|Ice Chalet at Portland's [[Lloyd Center]], where Harding began skating at age four]]

Tonya Maxene Harding was born on November 12, 1970, in Portland, Oregon, to LaVona Golden and Albert Gordon Harding (1933–2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tillamookheadlightherald.com/obituaries/albert-gordon-harding/article_fbf7f286-1e22-5e3d-8d4b-3c27f9952c35.html |title=Albert Gordon Harding |newspaper=Headlight-Herald|date=2009-04-14| accessdate=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in [[East Portland, Oregon|East Portland]], and began skating at age three, training with coach Diane Rawlinson. During her youth, Harding also hunted, drag raced, and learned automotive mechanics from her father. LaVona struggled to support the family while working as a waitress, and hand-sewed her daughter's skating costumes as they could not afford to purchase them. Harding's parents divorced after 19 years of marriage in 1987, when she was 16 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dpNODgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=They%20divorced%20in%201987|url-access=subscription|last1=Prouse|first1=Lynda D.|last2=Harding|first2=Tonya|title=The Tonya Tapes|year=2008|page=40|access-date=2018-08-03|quote=[My parents] divorced in 1987. They separated in February, and then their divorce was final sometime in the summer}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later dropped out of [[Milwaukie High School]] during her sophomore year in order to focus on skating, and earned a General Equivalency Diploma.{{sfn|Prouse|Harding|2008|pages=13; 44; 46; 65}}

According to Harding, she was frequently abused by her mother. She stated that by the time she was seven years old, both physical and psychological abuse had become a regular part of her life. LaVona admitted to one instance of hitting Harding at an ice rink.&lt;ref name="Oprah Sk Sc"&gt;{{cite web |website=Oprah.com |url=http://www.oprah.com/world/Tonya-Hardings-Figure-Skating-Scandal/5 |title=Tonya Harding's Skating Scandal |access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, Harding's childhood friend and filmmaker, Sandra Luckow, spoke in defence of Harding's mother because she felt that the 2017 film ''I, Tonya'' stretched some truths about LaVona's character. Luckow said that although Harding's mother could be "egregious" towards her daughter, LaVona actually funded and appreciated Harding's skating lessons – and had "a huge amount of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://people.com/movies/tonya-harding-mother-monster-friend/|first=Ale|last=Russian|title=Was Tonya Harding's Mom Really a Monster?

In Harding's 2008 authorized biography, ''The Tonya Tapes'' (written by Lynda D. Prouse from recorded interviews she had with Harding), she revealed she was the victim of acquaintance rape in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dpNODgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20never%20told%20anybody%20because%20I%20knew%20the%20person|url-access=subscription|last1=Prouse|first1=Lynda D.|last2=Harding|first2=Tonya|title=The Tonya Tapes|year=2008|pages=125; 132|access-date=July 31, 2018|quote=I was separated from Jeff [at the] time in '91.

In 1986, Harding called the police after Davison had been sexually harassing and terrorizing her. He was arrested and spent a short time in prison. Harding claimed that her parents were in denial about Davison's behavior and told her not to press criminal charges against him. Davison was killed in a 1988 unsolved vehicular hit-and-run accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dpNODgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=.And%20my%20mother%20and%20father%20came%20home%20and%20said%20I%20was|url-access=subscription|last1=Prouse|first1=Lynda D.|last2=Harding|first2=Tonya|title=The Tonya Tapes|year=2008|pages=57–62|access-date=July 30, 2018|quote=[The police] ended up arresting [Davison]...And my mother and father came home and said I was [lying about the harassment].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Not Your Average Ice Queen"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1992/01/13/125774/not-your-average-ice-queen-a-troubled-past-hasnt-stopped-tonya-harding-from-becoming-a-figure-skating-champion|title=Not Your Average Ice Queen|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=Jan 13, 1992|accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 3, 1994, during an interview with [[Rolonda Watts]], Harding said that Chris Davison was the lone person in her life unworthy of forgiveness and "the only person I've ever hated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/1994/tv/news/rolonda-first-talker-to-nab-tonya-interview-120020/|title='Rolonda' first talker to nab Tonya interview|last=Flint|first=Joe|magazine=Variety|date=April 8, 1994|accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95rjRhjESUg&amp;t=1012s Rolonda Watts' Interview with Tonya Harding].

== Skating career ==
Harding trained as a figure skater throughout her youth with coach Diane Rawlinson. In the mid-1980s, she began working her way up the competitive skating ladder. She placed sixth at the 1986 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, fifth in 1987 and 1988, and third in 1989. After competing in the February [[1989 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|1989 Nationals Championship]], Harding began training with Dody Teachman as her coach.&lt;ref name="Hersh"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-03-04/sports/9201200938_1_diane-rawlinson-dody-teachman-tonya-harding|title=Skater Changes Coaches, Again|first=Phil|last=Hersh|newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=March 4, 1992|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dpNODgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=snippet&amp;q=%22Who%20was%20your%20coach%22|url-access=subscription|last1=Prouse|first1=Lynda D.|last2=Harding|first2=Tonya|title=The Tonya Tapes|year=2008|page=26|access-date=2018-08-03|quote=Who was your coach...through your amateur years? *'Diane...then Dody Teachman was my other coach - when I came into my 18 year old teenage years thinking I knew everything...'*}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then won the October [[1989 Skate America]] competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|layurl=https://www.statelib.lib.in.us/IndyNews/1848_1991_display.asp?ID=123488|title=Skate America, major international figure skating coming to Indianapolis in October 1989|page=12|via=www.StateLib.lib.In.us (Indiana State Library)|department=Indianapolis Newspapers Database, 1848-1991|newspaper=The Indianapolis Star|date=Aug 20, 1989|postscript= : Section B, column 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered a strong contender at the February [[1990 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]]. However, she was suffering from the [[influenza|flu]] and [[asthma]] and had a poor free skate. After the original program, she dropped from second place and finished seventh overall.{{sfn|Prouse|Harding|2008|pages=96-98}} Harding was a powerful free skater and typically had lower placements in the [[compulsory figures]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/17/sports/figure-skating-harding-takes-singles-title.html|title=Harding Takes Singles Title|first=Micheal|last=Janofsky|newspaper=New York Times|date=Feb 17, 1991|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1988/01/07/Figure-Skating-Results/3923568530000/|title=1988 U.S. Figure Skating Championships Results|department=Senior-level Ladies|agency=United Press International (UPI)|date=Jan 7, 1988|access-date=2018-07-27|quote=Tonya Harding ranked 8th out of 19th in Compulsory Figures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harding's breakthrough year came in 1991 when, at the [[1991 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]], she completed her first [[triple Axel]] in competition on February 16 — the first American woman to execute the jump.&lt;ref name=nyt910312&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/12/sports/figure-skating-a-triple-axel-with-rippling-effects.html |title=A Triple Axel With Rippling Effects |first=Michael |last=Janofsky |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 12, 1991|accessdate=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won the 1991 U.S. Ladies' Singles title with the event's first 6.0 technical merit score since [[Janet Lynn]]'s 1973 performance at the U.S. Championships.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; At the March 1991 World Championships, an international event, she again completed the triple Axel. Harding would finish second behind [[Kristi Yamaguchi]], and in front of Nancy Kerrigan, marking the first time one country swept the ladies medal podium at the [[World Figure Skating Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/17/sports/figure-skating-skating-sweep-for-the-us-women.html|title=Skating Sweep for the U.S. Women|first=Michael|last=Janofsky|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 17, 1991|accessdate=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the September [[1991 Skate America]] competition, Harding recorded three more firsts:
* The first woman to complete a triple Axel in the short program
* The first woman to successfully execute two triple Axels in a single competition
* The first ever to complete a triple Axel in combination (with the double [[toe loop]])

Despite these record-breaking performances, after 1991, Harding was never able to successfully complete the triple Axel in competition again; her competitive results began to decline. She and Dody Teachman had briefly parted ways in April 1991, but had reunited in June;&lt;ref name="Not Your Average Ice Queen" /&gt; Harding was still training under Teachman for the upcoming 1992 season. She placed third in the January [[1992 U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] despite twisting her ankle during practice, and finished fourth in the February [[1992 Winter Olympics]]. On March 1, 1992, Harding gave Teachman a summary dismissal and returned to Diane Rawlinson to be coached by her.&lt;ref name="Hersh"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-03-08/sports/9201220344_1_diane-rawlinson-dody-teachman-tonya-harding|title=Adulation On Hold For Tonya Harding|first=Phil|last=Hersh|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=March 8, 1992|accessdate=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 29 Harding placed sixth in the [[1992 World Figure Skating Championships|1992 World Championships]], although she had a better placement at the November [[1992 Skate Canada International]] event finishing fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.onthisday.com/date/1992/march/29 |title=What Happened on March 29, 1992|website=OnThisDay.com (Today in History Archives)|department=Ladies Figure Skating Championship in Oakland won by Kristi Yamaguchi|editor-last=Graham|editor-first=James|orig-year=2000|accessdate=2018-08-05|postscript= → Kristi Yamaguchi would have won the event on the same day as the other Ladies' Singles free skate}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Haight|Vader|1994|p=35}} In the 1993 season, she skated poorly in the U.S. Championships and failed to qualify for the World Championship team.

== Attack on Nancy Kerrigan and aftermath ==

On {{start date|1994|1|6}}, one day before the [[1994 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Figure Skating Championship]] first Ladies' Singles competition, [[Nancy Kerrigan]] was attacked after a practice session at the Detroit [[Cobo Center|Cobo Arena]]. The assailant was Shane Stant, contracted to break her right leg.&lt;ref name="anatomy of plot"/&gt; Stant and his uncle, Derrick Smith, were hired for this [[assault]] by Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her one-time bodyguard, Shawn Eckardt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sportsworld.nbcsports.com/nancy-tonya/]. ''NBC SportsWorld''. ''Nancy &amp; Tonya'' (2014) documentary. Tonya telling a reporter "Shawn is my bodyguard" while he walks beside her on January 10, 1994 - time code ca 0:29:14&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to find Kerrigan at her Massachusetts training rink, Stant had taken a 20-hour bus trip to Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/sports/figure-skating-traveling-far-and-lying-low-to-get-nancy-kerrigan.html|title=Traveling Far and Lying Low to Get Nancy Kerrigan|work=New York Times|first=Joseph B. |last=Treaster|date=Jan 23, 1994|accessdate=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Kerrigan was walking behind a curtain to a corridor when Stant rushed behind her. Using both hands, he then swung a 21-inch [[ASP, Inc.|ASP]] [[telescopic baton]] at her right leg, striking her above the knee. The intent was preventing her competing in both the National Championships (Kerrigan was the defending [[1993 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|1993 U.S. Ladies' Champion]]) and the Winter Olympics. Kerrigan's leg was not broken but severely bruised, forcing her to withdraw from the Championships and forgo competing to retain the U.S. Ladies' title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/07/sports/figure-skating-kerrigan-attacked-after-practice-assailant-flees.html|title=Kerrigan Attacked After Practice; Assailant Flees

On March 21, 1994, a Portland grand jury issued an indictment stating there was evidence Harding participated in the attack plot. The indictment concluded more than two months of investigation and witness testimonies from Diane Rawlinson, Erika Bakacs (Harding's choreographer), Eckardt's college instructor and classmates, and Vera Marano (a freelance figure skating writer in Philadelphia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/olympics1998/history/timeline/articles/time_012194.htm|title=Bodyguard Says Harding Knew of Plot|newspaper=Washington Post|first=Christine|last=Brennan|date=Jan 21, 1994|access-date=July 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oregonlive.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruscas"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/334609/RECORDS-INDICATE-HARDING-LIED-ABOUT-PHONE-CALLS.html|title=Records Indicate Harding Lied About Phone Calls|date=Feb 4, 1994|first=Angelo|last=Bruscas|accessdate=Aug 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pleads guilty" /&gt; It stated there was evidence Harding fraudulently used USFSA provided skating monies to finance the assault.

He reported that Harding still held to her statement from her press-conference given on January 27, 1994: "I had no prior knowledge of the planned assault on Nancy Kerrigan." Smith then interviewed Kerrigan, asking how she responded to that statement.  Nancy Kerrigan referred to transcripts she had read from Harding's FBI interview on January 18, 1994. After reading through the interrogation of that day, she concluded that "[Tonya] knew more than she admits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1994/03/07/130609/silver-belle-nancy-kerrigan-conquered-her-demons-but-couldnt-overcome-a-pixie-from-ukraine|first=E.

Stone reflected on Harding's position of "limited involvement" in Kerrigan's attack and speculated that a "guilty conscience" still troubled her.

In Harding's 2008 biography, ''The Tonya Tapes'' (transcribed by Lynda D. Prouse from recorded interviews), she stated that she wanted to call the FBI in 1994 to reveal what she knew, but decided not to when Gillooly allegedly threatened her with death following a gunpoint gang rape by him and two other men she did not know. Jeff (Gillooly) Stone responded with surprise that groundless claims against him could be published and specifically contended her gang rape accusation to be "utterly ridiculous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.today.com/news/tonya-harding-reveals-her-side-roller-coaster-life-1C9015579 |title=Tonya Harding reveals her side of 'roller-coaster life'|date=May 15, 2008|first=Mike|last=Celizic |accessdate=July 4, 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901024350/https://www.today.com/news/tonya-harding-reveals-her-side-roller-coaster-life-1C9015579|archivedate=2017-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, ''[[Deadspin]]'' sought Jeff Stone for an interview and he again defended himself from the gunpoint gang rape allegation.

In 2014, Nancy Kerrigan addressed the scandal during a brief interview with sportscaster [[Bob Costas]]: "Whatever apology Tonya has given, I accept it.

In 2002, Harding boxed against [[Paula Jones]] on the [[Fox Network|Fox TV network]] ''[[Celebrity Boxing]]'' event, winning the fight. On February 22, 2003, she made her official [[women's boxing|women's professional boxing]] debut, losing a four-round [[split decision]] against Samantha Browning on the undercard of [[Mike Tyson vs. Clifford Etienne]].

She liked how the play explored issues of class and competition, as well as Raidt's performance – yet thought it lacked Harding's "edgy toughness." Houlihan also admired Kelli Simpkins' performance as "Joanne," Harding's coach. She praised Bordelon's direction for "[steering] the actors away from any broad, [[Camp (style)|campy]] interpretation" and Aibel's writing for "deftly [capturing] the despicable side of the story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/t-stage-drama-revisits-the-still-fascinating-kerrigan-harding-saga/|url-access=limited|last=Houlihan|first=Mary|title='T.' stage drama revisits the still-fascinating Kerrigan-Harding saga|date=May 27, 2017|newspaper=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=Aug 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic assessment ===
Because Harding admitted to obstructing the investigation of Nancy Kerrigan's assault, her name is often first associated with the 1994 scandal. However, numerous academic essays have theorized additional reasons, particularly considering her [[Social class in the United States|national class culture]] and past figure skating membership, for Harding's perceived [[social stigma]]tization.&lt;ref name= believermag.com&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Marshall |first=Sarah |url=https://believermag.com/remote-control/ |title=Remote Control: Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, and the Spectacles of Female Power &amp; Pain |magazine=The Believer|date=Jan 2014|accessdate=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the book ''Women on Ice: Feminist Essays on the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan Spectacle'' was published, containing numerous essays analyzing Harding's public image.{{sfn|Baughman|2013|pages=i–v}} For example, Abigail Feder-Kane wrote that there existed "[[Overdetermination|overdetermined]] [[femininity]] in Ladies' Figure Skating...femininity and [[Women's sports|athleticism]] are mutually exclusive concepts in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oates|first=Thomas P.|editor-last=Burns|editor-first=Gary|year=2016|title=A Companion to Popular Culture (Blackwell Companions in Cultural Studies)|url-access=subscription|pages=275; 282|chapter=Part 5: Pastimes &amp; Practices|department=Sports: Marketing of the Black Style &amp; Containing Gendered Threats|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=P2jWCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=abigail%20feder-kane|isbn=9781405192057|oclc=959326257|ref=harv|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|access-date=Aug 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Stoloff believed that, during the scandal, the media placed a greater emphasis on Harding's [[Working class in the United States|class]] rather than her gender (femininity). He noted how she was subjected to a "litany of vaguely [[pejorative]] or mocking expressions" associated with "low class" cultural attributes, sometimes due to Harding's personal interests and hobbies. Stoloff theorized that Harding represented an American social class that required interpretation ("the class Other") as he referenced the [[Anthropology|anthropological]] tone of [[Susan Orlean]]'s 1994 essay "Figures in a Mall," written for ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoloff|first=Sam|editor1-last=Birrell|editor1-first=Susan|editor2-last=McDonald|editor2-first=Mary G.|year=2000|pages=234–250|title=Reading Sport: Critical Essays on Power and Representation|orig-year=1995|department=Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, &amp; the Bodily Figuration of Social Class|url-access=subscription|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=U4ukmwWWzgEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=sam%20stoloff|oclc=43036842|isbn=1555534309|ref=harv|publisher=Northeastern University Press|access-date=Aug 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orlean" /&gt;

In academic Sarah Marshall's 2014 essay entitled "Remote Control: Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, and the Spectacles of Female Power and Pain," she noted the pervasive role of the media in the 1994 scandal, particularly the manner in which Harding's life outside the realm of skating became publicly scrutinized: "Somehow, in the scandal's aftermath, the form of the Tonya-bash was able to alchemize even the most chilling details of Tonya's life into tabloid gold." Marshall also examined the role of Harding's "[[tomboy]]" persona in the context of figure skating. She theorized that Harding was rejected by the figure skating [[ethos]] because she did not conform – as Marshall believed many figure skaters including Nancy Kerrigan did – to appearing as "beautiful without being sexual, strong without being intimidating, and vulnerable without being weak."&lt;ref name=believermag.com/&gt;

In Tyler Chase Knowles' 2016 honors thesis entitled "Taking Out the Trash: Middle Class Anxieties and The White Trash Menace," he extrapolated on a quotation made by Emma Gray in her 2014 ''[[HuffPost]]'' article. The quotation explored how Gray believed Harding was labelled "the skating world's perfect villain" due to her appearance, [[Dysfunctional family|broken home]], and [[Poverty in the United States|impoverished background]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/emma-gray/nancy-kerrigan-tonya-harding-the-price-of-gold_b_4578036.html|department=The Blog|title=What We Missed About The Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya Harding Scandal 20 Years Ago|first=Emma|last=Gray|newspaper=HuffPost|date=Jan 10, 2014|accessdate=Aug 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowles theorized that there also existed the [[Sociocultural perspective|socio-cultural]] personified "Defender" who also chose to reject Harding. He defined the "Defender" as a person or persons who sympathize(s) with the [[working poor]], a group including the [[Poor white|white underclass]]. The "Defender" would blame the plight of the poor on [[Economic sociology|societal]] and [[Income inequality in the United States|economic]] factors, yet the "Defender" would continue to reinforce [[Normality (behavior)|conventional values]] such as [[Class stratification|distinguishing the class border]]. Knowles argued that Harding did not belong in the "Defender's" approved category of "poor white" because she did not – in the opinion of the "Defender" – make enough effort, given her figure skating membership, to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] towards [[elite culture]]. The "Defender" wanted Tonya Harding to use her USFSA membership for [[social mobility]], caring little whether she could prove herself to be [[High performance sport|among the best Olympic competitors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Knowles|first=Tyler Chase|date=April 2016|publication-place=Connecticut|title=Taking Out the Trash: Middle Class Anxieties and The White Trash Menace|department=The Perfect Woman: A Case Study on Tonya Harding|type=Honors Thesis|chapter=2|publisher=Faculty of Wesleyan University |url=https://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.ca/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2584&amp;context=etd_hon_theses|access-date=Aug 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Triple Modular Redundancy.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Triple Modular Redundancy. Three identical logic circuits (logic gates) are used to compute the specified Boolean function. The set of data at the input of the first circuit are identical to the input of the second and third gates.]]

In [[computing]], '''triple modular redundancy''', sometimes called '''triple-mode redundancy''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xilinx.com/publications/archives/xcell/Xcell50.pdf David Ratter. "FPGAs on Mars"]&lt;/ref&gt; (TMR) is a [[fault-tolerant]] form of [[N-modular redundancy]], in which three systems perform a process and that result is processed by a majority-voting system to produce a single output. If any one of the three systems fails, the other two systems can correct and mask the fault.

The TMR concept can be applied to many forms of [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]], such as software redundancy in the form of [[N-version programming]], and is commonly found in [[fault-tolerant computer system]]s.

Some [[ECC memory]] uses triple modular redundancy hardware (rather than the more common [[Hamming code]]), because triple modular redundancy hardware is faster than Hamming error correction software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some communication systems use N-modular redundancy as a simple form of [[forward error correction]]. For example, 5-modular redundancy communication systems (such as [[FlexRay]]) use the majority of 5 samples &amp;ndash; if any 2 of the 5 results are erroneous, the other 3 results can correct and mask the fault.

Modular redundancy is a basic concept, dating to antiquity, while the first use of TMR in a computer was the Czechoslovak computer [[SAPO (computer)|SAPO]], in the 1950s.

==Chronometers==
To use triple modular redundancy, a ship must have at least three [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]]; two chronometers provided [[dual modular redundancy]], allowing a backup if one should cease to work, but not allowing any [[error correction]] if the two displayed a different time, since in case of contradiction between the  two chronometers, it would be impossible to know which one was wrong (the [[error detection]] obtained would be the same of having only one chronometer and checking it periodically). Three chronometers provided triple modular redundancy, allowing [[error correction]] if one of the three was wrong, so the pilot would take the average of the two with closer reading (vote for average precision).

There is an old adage to this effect, stating: "Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 0-201-83595-9 | title = [[The Mythical Man-Month]] | last = Brooks | first = Frederick J. | authorlink = Fred Brooks | year = 1995 | origyear = 1975 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | page = 64  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainly this means that if two [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]] contradict, how do you know which one is correct? At one time this observation or rule was an expensive one as the cost of three sufficiently accurate chronometers was more than the cost of many types of smaller merchant vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some vessels carried more than three chronometers &amp;ndash; for example, the [[HMS Beagle]] carried [[List of chronometers on HMS Beagle|22 chronometers]].&lt;ref&gt;

In the modern era, ships at sea use GNSS navigation receivers (with [[GPS]], [[GLONASS]] &amp; WAAS etc. support) -- mostly running with WAAS or ENGOS support so as to provide accurate time (and location).

== Majority logic gate ==
In TMR, three identical logic circuits (logic gates) are used to compute the same set of specified Boolean function. If there are no circuit failures, the outputs of the three circuits are identical. But due to circuit failures, the outputs of the three circuits may be different.

A majority logic gate is used to decide which of the circuits’ outputs is the correct output. The majority gate output is 1 if two or more of the inputs of the majority gate are 1; output is 0 if two or more of the majority gate’s inputs are 0.

The majority logic gate is a simple AND–OR circuit: if the inputs to the majority gate are denoted by x, y and z, then the output of the majority gate is 
:&lt;math&gt; xy \lor yz \lor xz &lt;/math&gt;  
Thus, the majority gate is the [[Carry (arithmetic)#Computing|carry output]] of a [[full adder]], i.e., the majority gate is a [[voting machine]].&lt;ref name=DilipSarwate2012/&gt;

==TMR operation==
Assuming the Boolean function computed by the three identical logic gates has value 1, then: (a) if no circuit has failed, all three circuits produce an output of value 1, and the majority gate output has value 1. (b)	 if one circuit fails and produces an output of 0, while the other two are working correctly and produce an output of 1, the majority gate output is 1, i.e., it still has the correct value. And similarly for the case when the Boolean function computed by the three identical circuits has value 0.  Thus, the majority gate output is guaranteed to be correct as long as no more than one of the three identical logic circuits has failed.&lt;ref name=DilipSarwate2012&gt;Professor Dilip V. Sarwate, Lecture Notes for ECE 413 - Probability with Engineering Applications, [[UIUC College of Engineering#Departments|Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)]], [[UIUC College of Engineering]], [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]&lt;/ref&gt;

TMR systems should use [[data scrubbing]]—rewrite flip-flops periodically—in order to avoid accumulation of errors.&lt;ref&gt;

== Voter ==

The majority gate itself could fail.
Is there a way to mask that failure?

In a few TMR systems, such as
the [[Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer]] and
'''functional triple modular redundancy (FTMR)''' systems,
the voters are also triplicated.
Three voters are used &amp;ndash; one for each copy of the next stage of TMR logic. 
In such systems there is no [[single point of failure]].

&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in contrast to the relatively complicated Boolean functions computed in triplicate by the TMR system, the majority gate is a simple circuit, thus its probability of failure is significantly smaller than that of each of the three circuits computing the Boolean function.&lt;ref name=DilipSarwate2012/&gt;
In other systems there is only a single voter—If the voter fails in such a system, then the complete system will fail.
However, in a good TMR system the voter is much more [[Reliability engineering|reliable]] than the other TMR components.

== Triple modular redundancy in popular culture ==
* The three pre-cogs in [[The Minority Report|Minority Report]] lead to a conviction even when one disagrees.
* To rule out that a single win was "a fluke", some competitions use a [[two out of three falls match]]. This isn't true TMR, however, because the three falls are not independent of each other &amp;ndash; each competitor knows who has most falls at any point in the competition, which influences their future actions.
* In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'', the Ramans make heavy use of triple redundancy.

'''Vermicompost''' ('''vermi-compost''', '''vermiculture''') is the product of the [[composting]] process using various species of [[worm]]s, usually [[Eisenia foetida|red wigglers]], [[Enchytraeus buchholzi|white worms]], and other [[earthworm]]s, to create a mixture of decomposing vegetable or food waste, bedding materials, and vermicast. 

Vermicast (also called worm castings, worm humus, worm manure, or worm feces) is the end-product of the breakdown of [[organic matter]] by earthworms.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://southwoodsforestgardens.blogspot.com/2009/01/paper-on-invasive-european-worms.html |title=Paper on Invasive European Worms |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These castings have been shown to contain reduced levels of contaminants and a higher saturation of nutrients than the organic materials before vermicomposting.&lt;ref name="Effects of stocking density and feeding rate on vermicomposting of biosolids"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ndegwa, P.M. |author2=Thompson, S.A. |author3=Das, K.C. | title = Effects of stocking density and feeding rate on vermicomposting of biosolids | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 5–12 | year = 1998 | pmid = | doi =10.1016/S0960-8524(99)00055-3 | url = http://www.earthworm.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/effect-of-stocking-density-feeding-rate-on-vermicomposting-of-biosolids.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:African Night Crawler.jpg|thumb|[[Eudrilus eugeniae|African Night Crawler]] (a type of earthworm) as decomposer]]
Vermicomposting has gained popularity in both industrial and domestic settings because, as compared with conventional composting, it provides a way to treat organic wastes more quickly. It also generates products that have lower [[salinity]] levels that are therefore more beneficial to plant mediums.&lt;ref name="Lacanzo, 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lazcano, Cristina |author2=Gómez-Brandón, María |author3=Domínguez, Jorge | title = Comparison of the effectiveness of composting and vermicomposting for the biological stabilization of cattle manure | journal = Chemosphere | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 1013–1019 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18511100| doi = 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.04.016| url = http://webs.uvigo.es/jdguez/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Comparison-of-the-effectiveness-of-composting-and-vermicomposting.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Compost_with_worms.jpg|thumb|right|Food waste with worms]]
The earthworm species (or composting worms) most often used are red wigglers (''[[Eisenia fetida]]'' or ''[[Eisenia andrei]]''), though European nightcrawlers (''[[Eisenia hortensis]]'' or ''[[Eisenia hortensis|Dendrobaena veneta]]'') could also be used. Red wigglers are recommended by most vermicomposting experts, as they have some of the best appetites and breed very quickly. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including ''dendrobaenas'', ''dendras'', Dutch nightcrawlers, and Belgian nightcrawlers.

Containing water-soluble nutrients, vermicompost is a nutrient-rich [[organic fertilizer]] and soil conditioner in a form that is relatively easy for plants to absorb.&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, Kelly and Erik Knutzen. ''The Urban Homestead: Your Guide to Self-Sufficient Living in the Heart of the City.'' Port Townsend: Process Self Reliance Series, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Worm castings are sometimes used as an organic fertilizer. Because the earthworms grind and uniformly mix minerals in simple forms, plants need only minimal effort to obtain them. The worms' digestive systems create environments that allow certain species of microbes to thrive to help create a "living" soil environment for plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=C.A.|title=Earthworm Ecology|date=1998|publisher=CRC Press LLC|isbn=1-884015-74-3|pages=189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fraction of soil which has gone through the digestive tract of earthworms is called the [[Drilosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Organic Phosphorus in the Environment, Turner, ''et al.'', Page 91. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design considerations==
===Suitable worm species===
One of the species most often used for composting is the red wiggler or tiger worm (''Eisenia fetida'' or ''Eisenia andrei''); ''[[Lumbricus rubellus]]'' (a.k.a. red earthworm or dilong (China)) is another breed of worm that can be used, but it does not adapt as well to the shallow compost bin as does ''Eisenia fetida''. European nightcrawlers (''Eisenia hortensis'') may also be used. Users refer to European nightcrawlers by a variety of other names, including dendrobaenas, dendras, and Belgian nightcrawlers.  African Nightcrawlers (''[[Eudrilus eugeniae]]'') are another set of popular composters. ''[[Lumbricus terrestris]]'' (a.k.a. Canadian nightcrawlers (US) or common earthworm (UK)) are not recommended, since they burrow deeper than most compost bins can accommodate.&lt;ref name="thf"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://herronfarms.webs.com/ | title=Composting with earthworms| publisher=Herron Farms Dawsonville Ga. | accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blueworms (''[[Perionyx excavatus]]'') may be used in the tropics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctahr.hawaii.edu/oc/freepubs/pdf/HG-46.pdf |title=Composting Worms for Hawaii |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These species commonly are found in organic-rich soils throughout Europe and North America and live in rotting [[vegetation]], compost, and [[manure]] piles. They may be an [[invasive species]] in some areas.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrri.umn.edu/worms/ |title=Great Lakes Worm Watch |accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they are shallow-dwelling and feed on decomposing plant matter in the soil, they adapt easily to living on food or plant waste in the confines of a worm bin.

Composting worms are available to order online, from nursery mail-order suppliers or [[angling]] shops where they are sold as [[Bait (luring substance)|bait]]. They can also be collected from compost and manure piles. These species are not the same worms that are found in ordinary soil or on pavement when the soil is flooded by water.

===Large scale===
Large-scale vermicomposting is practiced in Canada, Italy, Japan, India, Malaysia, the Philippines, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.krepublishers4-1-059-08-1636-%20Aalok-A/JHE-24-1-059-08-1636-%20Aalok-A-Tt.pdf |title=Vermicomposting: A Better Option for Organic Solid Waste Management |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.leaffin.com/compost-tea/ | title=Compost Tea|accessdate=2018-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The vermicompost may be used for farming, landscaping, to create [[compost tea]], or for sale. Some of these operations produce worms for bait and/or home vermicomposting.

There are two main methods of large-scale vermiculture. Some systems use a [[windrow]], which consists of bedding materials for the earthworms to live in and acts as a large bin; organic material is added to it. Although the windrow has no physical barriers to prevent worms from escaping, in theory they should not due to an abundance of organic matter for them to feed on. Often windrows are used on a concrete surface to prevent predators from gaining access to the worm population.

The [[Windrow composting|windrow method]] and compost windrow turners were developed by Fletcher Sims Jr. of the Compost Corporation in Canyon, Texas. The Windrow Composting system is noted as a sustainable, cost-efficient way for farmers to manage dairy waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Windrow composting systems can be {{sic|nolink=y|feasable}}, cost effective (Research Brief #20) {{!}} Center for Integrated Agricultural Systems|url = http://www.cias.wisc.edu/windrow-composting-systems-can-be-feasable-cost-effective/|website = www.cias.wisc.edu|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Worm bed wave.svg|thumb|350px|Movement of castings through a worm bed]]

The second type of large-scale vermicomposting system is the raised bed or flow-through system. Here the worms are fed an inch of "worm chow" across the top of the bed, and an inch of castings are harvested from below by pulling a breaker bar across the large mesh screen which forms the base of the bed.

Because red worms are surface dwellers constantly moving towards the new food source, the flow-through system eliminates the need to separate worms from the castings before packaging. Flow-through systems are well suited to indoor facilities, making them the preferred choice for operations in colder climates.

===Small scale===
[[File:Wormbin.sample.jpg|thumb|right|Demonstration home scale worm bin at a community garden site (painted [[plywood]])]]
[[File:Wormbin.jpg|thumb|Diagram of a household-scale worm composting bin]]
For vermicomposting at home, a large variety of bins are commercially available, or a variety of adapted containers may be used. They may be made of old plastic containers, wood, [[Styrofoam]], or metal containers. The design of a small bin usually depends on where an individual wishes to store the bin and how they wish to feed the worms.

Some materials are less desirable than others in worm bin construction. Metal containers often conduct heat too readily, are prone to rusting, and may release [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s into the vermicompost. Styrofoam containers may release chemicals into the organic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Worm Compost Bins - What To Look For and What To Avoid|url = http://www.best-organic-fertilizer.com/worm-compost-bins.html|website = www.best-organic-fertilizer.com|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Cedrus|cedars]], [[Yellow cedar]], and [[Coast Redwood|Redwood]] contain resinous oils that may harm worms,&lt;ref name=raising&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.p2pays.org/ref/35/34577.pdf |title=Raising Earthworms Successfully |accessdate=2009-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Western Red Cedar]] has excellent longevity in composting conditions. [[Tsuga|Hemlock]] is another inexpensive and fairly rot-resistant wood species that may be used to build worm bins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampalandscaping.org/red-wiggler-compost-worm-bin.png] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724023034/http://vermontworms.com/red-wiggler-compost-worm-bin/|date=July 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bins need holes or mesh for aeration. Some people add a spout or holes in the bottom for excess liquid to drain into a tray for collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Build your own Worm Farm|url = http://andreas-heeschen.co.uk/2016/02/02/build-your-own-worm-farm/|website = Growing Organic|access-date = 2016-02-21|last = Andreasheeschen|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160213203115/http://andreas-heeschen.co.uk/2016/02/02/build-your-own-worm-farm/|archive-date = 2016-02-13|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common materials used are plastic: recycled polyethylene and polypropylene and wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Vermiculture|url = http://www.worm-farm.co.za/vermiculture.html|website = www.worm-farm.co.za|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worm compost bins made from plastic are ideal, but require more drainage than wooden ones because they are non-absorbent. However, wooden bins will eventually decay and need to be replaced.

Small-scale vermicomposting is well-suited to turn kitchen waste into high-quality [[soil amendment]]s, where space is limited. Worms can decompose organic matter without the additional human physical effort (turning the bin) that [[composting|bin composting]] requires.

Composting worms which are detritivorous (eaters of trash), such as the red wiggler ''Eisenia fetidae'', are epigeic (surface dwellers) and together with symbiotic associated microbes are the ideal vectors for decomposing food waste. Common earthworms such as ''Lumbricus terrestris'' are anecic (deep burrowing) species and hence unsuitable for use in a closed system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Worm Dictionary and Vermiculture Reference Center|url=http://www.working-worms.com/content/view/43/68/#d|publisher=Working Worms|accessdate=3 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028160939/http://www.working-worms.com/content/view/43/68/#d|archive-date=28 October 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other soil species that contribute include [[insect]]s, other worms and [[mold]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trautmann |first=Nancy |url=http://compost.css.cornell.edu/invertebrates.html |title=Invertebrates of the Compost Pile |publisher=Cornell Center for the Environment |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate and temperature===
There may be differences in vermicomposting methods depending on the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gardeningknowhow.com/composting/vermicomposting/hot-climate-vermiculture.htm|title=High Heat And Worm Bins – Tips For Vermicomposting When It's Hot|website=Gardening Know How|language=en-US|access-date=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary to monitor the temperatures of large-scale bin systems (which can have high [[Heat capacity|heat-retentive]] properties), as the raw materials or [[feedstock]]s used can [[compost]], heating up the worm bins as they decay and killing the worms.

The most common worms used in composting systems, redworms (''[[Eisenia foetida]],'' ''[[Eisenia andrei]],'' and ''[[Lumbricus rubellus]]'') feed most rapidly at temperatures of 15–25&amp;nbsp;°C (59-77&amp;nbsp;°F). They can survive at 10&amp;nbsp;°C (50&amp;nbsp;°F). Temperatures above 30&amp;nbsp;°C (86&amp;nbsp;°F) may harm them.&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This temperature range means that indoor vermicomposting with redworms is possible in all but tropical climates. Other worms like [[Perionyx excavatus]] are suitable for warmer climates.&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; If a worm bin is kept outside, it should be placed in a sheltered position away from direct sunlight and insulated against frost in winter.

==Feedstock==
There are few food wastes that vermicomposting cannot compost, although meat waste and dairy products are likely to putrefy, and in outdoor bins can attract [[vermin]]. [[Green waste]] should be added in moderation to avoid heating the bin.

===Small-scale or home systems===

==Harvesting==
[[File:Worm.bin.jpg|right|thumb|Worms in a bin being harvested]]

Vermicompost is ready for harvest when it contains few-to-no scraps of uneaten food or bedding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are several methods of harvesting from small-scale systems: "dump and hand sort", "let the worms do the sorting", "alternate containers" and "divide and dump."&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, pp. 79-86&lt;/ref&gt; These differ on the amount of time and labor involved and whether the vermicomposter wants to save as many worms as possible from being trapped in the harvested compost.

The pyramid method of harvesting worm compost is commonly used in small-scale vermiculture, and is considered the simplest method for single layer bins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Harvesting - MMSB - Multi-Materials Stewardship Board|url = http://www.mmsb.nl.ca/composting/vermicomposting/harvesting/|website = MMSB - Multi-Materials Stewardship Board|access-date = 2016-02-21|language = en-US|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151028062058/http://www.mmsb.nl.ca/composting/vermicomposting/harvesting/|archive-date = 2015-10-28|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, compost is separated into large clumps, which is placed back into composting for further breakdown, and lighter compost, with which the rest of the process continues. This lighter mix is placed into small piles on a tarp under the sunlight. The worms instinctively burrow to the bottom of the pile. After a few minutes, the top of the pyramid is removed repeatedly, until the worms are again visible. This repeats until the mound is composed mostly of worms.

While harvesting, it's also a good idea to try to pick out as many eggs/cocoons as possible and return them to the bin. Cocoons are small, lemon-shaped yellowish objects that can usually be seen pretty easily with the naked eye and picked out.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://vermontworms.com/tag/red-wiggler-compost-worm-eggs/ |title=Red-wiggler Compost Worm eggs |access-date=2018-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318163515/https://vermontworms.com/tag/red-wiggler-compost-worm-eggs/ |archive-date=2018-03-18 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cocoons can hold up to 20 worms (though 2-3 is most common). Cocoons can lay dormant for as long as two years if conditions are not conducive for hatching. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cals.arizona.edu/yavapai/anr/hort/byg/archive/redwormbiology.html|title=Red Worm Biology|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Vermicompost has been shown to be richer in many [[nutrient]]s than compost produced by other composting methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dickerson |first=George W. |url=http://www.cahe.nmsu.edu/pubs/_h/h-164.pdf |title=Vermicomposting: Guide H-164 |publisher=New Mexico State University |format=PDF |date=June 2001 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also outperformed a commercial plant medium with nutrients added, but levels of [[magnesium]] required adjustment, as did pH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sherman |first=Rhonda |url=http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/topic/vermicomposting/vermiculture/castings.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117155144/http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/topic/vermicomposting/vermiculture/castings.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-01-17 |title=Earthworm Castings as Plant Growth Media |publisher=Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering at NCSU |accessdate=2012-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in one study it has been found that homemade backyard vermicompost was lower in microbial biomass, soil microbial activity, and yield of a species of [[ryegrass]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; than municipal compost.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lazcano|first=Cristina|author2=Gómez-Brandón, María |author3=Domínguez, Jorge |title=Comparison of the effectiveness of composting and vermicomposting for the biological stabilization of cattle manure|journal=Chemosphere|date=July 2008|volume=72|issue=7|pages=1013–1019|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2008.04.016 |url=http://webs.uvigo.es/jdguez/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Comparison-of-the-effectiveness-of-composting-and-vermicomposting.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=18511100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rich in microbial life which converts nutrients already present in the soil into plant-available forms.

Unlike other compost, worm castings also contain [[mucus|worm mucus]] which helps prevent nutrients from washing away with the first watering and holds moisture better than plain soil.&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, Loren; Taylor, Janet Hogan (1998).

Increases in the total nitrogen content in vermicompost, an increase in available nitrogen and phosphorus, as well as the increased removal of heavy metals from sludge and soil have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Comparative Study on Physical and Chemical Characteristics of Sludge Vermicomposted by Eisenia Fetida|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878029612005968|journal = Procedia Environmental Sciences|date = 2012-01-01|pages = 418–423|volume = 16|series = The Seventh International Conference on Waste Management and Technology (ICWMT 7)|doi = 10.1016/j.proenv.2012.10.058|first = Fei|last = Liu|first2 = Pengfei|last2 = Zhu|first3 = Jianping|last3 = Xue}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in the bioavailability of heavy metals has been observed in a number of studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Heavy metal and nutrient changes during vermicomposting animal manure spiked with mushroom residues|journal = Waste Management (New York, N.Y.)|date = 2014-11-01|issn = 1879-2456|pmid = 25128918|pages = 1977–1983|volume = 34|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.wasman.2014.07.013|first = Xiuchao|last = Song|first2 = Manqiang|last2 = Liu|first3 = Di|last3 = Wu|first4 = Lin|last4 = Qi|first5 = Chenglong|last5 = Ye|first6 = Jiaguo|last6 = Jiao|first7 = Feng|last7 = Hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Microbial biodegradation of waste materials for nutrients enrichment and heavy metals removal: An integrated composting-vermicomposting process|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262194513_Microbial_biodegradation_of_waste_materials_for_nutrients_enrichment_and_heavy_metals_removal_An_integrated_composting-vermicomposting_process|journal = International Biodeterioration &amp; Biodegradation|pages = 41–48|volume = 92|doi = 10.1016/j.ibiod.2014.04.011|first = Seyede Maryam|last = Kharrazi|first2 = Habibollah|last2 = Younesi|first3 = Javad|last3 = Abedini-Torghabeh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
'''Soil'''
* Improves soil aeration
* Enriches soil with micro-organisms (adding [[enzymes]] such as [[phosphatase]] and [[cellulase]])
* Microbial activity in worm castings is 10 to 20 times higher than in the soil and organic matter that the worm ingests &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Logsdon|first=Gene|title=Worldwide progress in vermicomposting|journal=BioCycle|date=October 1994|volume=35|issue=10|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=3324953|page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Attracts deep-burrowing earthworms already present in the soil
* Improves water holding capacity&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plant growth'''
* Enhances germination, plant growth, and crop yield
* Improves root growth and structure
* Enriches soil with micro-organisms (adding [[plant hormone]]s such as [[auxins]] and [[gibberellic acid]]){{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

'''Economic'''
* Biowastes conversion reduces waste flow to [[landfill]]s
* Elimination of biowastes from the waste stream reduces contamination of other recyclables collected in a single bin (a common problem in communities practicing [[Single-stream recycling]])
* Creates low-skill jobs at local level
* Low capital investment and relatively simple technologies make vermicomposting practical for less-developed agricultural regions

'''Environmental'''
* Helps to close the "[[metabolic rift|metabolic gap]]" through recycling waste on-site
* Large systems often use temperature control and mechanized harvesting, however other equipment is relatively simple and does not wear out quickly{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}
* Production reduces [[greenhouse gas]] emissions such as [[methane]] and [[nitric oxide]] (produced in landfills or [[incinerator]]s when not composted or through [[methane harvest]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19459535/ |title=Waste Management to tap landfill methane |publisher=MSNBC |date=June 27, 2007 |accessdate=2012-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Wormbin.bedding.jpg|thumb|right|Mid-scale worm bin (1&amp;nbsp;m X 2.5&amp;nbsp;m up to 1&amp;nbsp;m deep), freshly refilled with bedding]]

=== Soil conditioner ===
Vermicompost can be mixed directly into the soil.

The dark brown waste liquid, or [[leachate]], that drains into the bottom of some vermicomposting systems as water-rich foods break down, is best applied back to the bin when added moisture is needed due to the possibility of [[phytotoxin]] content and organic acids that may be toxic to plants.&lt;ref name=raising/&gt;

The pH, nutrient, and microbial content of these fertilizers varies upon the inputs fed to worms. Pulverized limestone, or calcium carbonate can be added to the system to raise the pH.

==Operation and maintenance==
[[File:Worms and fruit fly eggs.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Worms and fruit fly pupas under the lid of a home worm bin.]]

===Smells===
When closed, a well-maintained bin is odorless; when opened, it should have little smell—if any smell is present, it is earthy.&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; Worms require gaseous oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;Appelhof, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygen can be provided by airholes in the bin, occasional stirring of bin contents, and removal of some bin contents if they become too deep or too wet. If decomposition becomes anaerobic from excess wet feedstock added to the bin, or the layers of food waste have become too deep, the bin will begin to smell of [[ammonia]].

===Moisture===
Moisture must be maintained above 50%, as lower moisture content will not support worm respiration and can increase worm mortality. Operating moisture-content range should be between 70-90%, with a suggested content of 70-80% for vermicomposting-oriented vermiculture operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/faculty/agriculture/oacc/en/soil/Vermiculture_FarmersManual_gm.pdf|title=Manual of On-Farm Vermicomposting and Vermiculture|last=|first=|date=|website=|page=14|access-date=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; If decomposition has become anaerobic, to restore healthy conditions and prevent the worms from dying, excess waste water must be reduced and the bin returned to a normal moisture level. To do this, first reduce addition of food scraps with a high moisture content and second, add fresh, dry bedding such as shredded newspaper to your bin, mixing it in well.&lt;ref&gt;Nancarrow, Loren; Taylor, Janet Hogan (1998).

===Pest species===
Pests such as rodents and flies are attracted by certain materials and odors, usually from large amounts of kitchen waste, particularly meat. Eliminating the use of meat or dairy product in a worm bin decreases the possibility of pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cdn.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/faculty/agriculture/oacc/en/soil/Vermiculture_FarmersManual_gm.pdf|title=Manual of On-Farm Vermicomposting and Vermiculture|last=|first=|date=|website=|page=8|accessdate=2017-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Predatory ants can be a problem in African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David Watako, Koslengar Mougabe, and Thomas Heathfirst=|year=April 2016|title=Tiger worm toilets: lessons learned from constructing household vermicomposting toilets in Liberia|url=|journal=Waterlines|volume=35| issue =  2|pages=136–147|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In warm weather, fruit and vinegar flies breed in the bins if fruit and vegetable waste is not thoroughly covered with bedding. This problem can be avoided by thoroughly covering the waste by at least {{convert|5|cm|in}} of bedding. Maintaining the correct pH (close to neutral) and water content of the bin (just enough water where squeezed bedding drips a couple of drops) can help avoid these pests as well.

===Worms escaping===
Worms generally stay in the bin, but may try to leave the bin when first introduced, or often after a rainstorm when outside humidity is high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vermontworms.com/compost-worm-escape/ Compost Worm Escape]{{dead link|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining adequate conditions in the worm bin and putting a light over the bin when first introducing worms should eliminate this problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coldclimategarden.com/en/can-you-do-vermicomposting-in-an-apartment/ Can you do vermicomposting in an apartment?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005065728/http://www.coldclimategarden.com/en/can-you-do-vermicomposting-in-an-apartment/ |date=October 5, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nutrient levels===
Commercial vermicomposters test, and may amend their products to produce consistent quality and results. Because the small-scale and home systems use a varied mix of feedstocks, the nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus content of the resulting vermicompost will also be inconsistent. NPK testing may be helpful before the vermicompost or tea is applied to the garden.

In order to avoid over-fertilization issues, such as [[nitrogen burn]], vermicompost can be diluted as a tea 50:50 with water, or as a solid can be mixed in 50:50 with [[potting soil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grant|first=Tim|last2=Littlejohn|first2=Gail|title=Teaching Green, The Middle Years |year=2004|publisher=New Society Publishers|location=Gabriola Island, B.C.|isbn=978-0-86571-501-1 |page=121 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v46QjUMYuxkC&amp;pg=PT114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the mucous layer created by worms which surrounds their castings allows for a "time release" effect, meaning not all nutrients are released at once. This also reduces the risk of burning the plants, as is common with the use and overuse of commercial fertilizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigredworms.com/compost-or-worm-castings/ |title=Compost or Worm Castings? |publisher=Big Red Worms |accessdate=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application examples==

Vermicomposting (also known as vermiculture) is widely used in North America for on-site institutional processing of food scraps, such as in hospitals, universities, shopping malls, and correctional facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Clive A.|title=Vermiculture Technology|date=2010|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-0987-7|pages=392–406}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vermicomposting is used for medium-scale on-site institutional organic material recycling, such as for food scraps from universities and shopping malls. It is selected either as a more environmentally friendly choice than conventional disposal, or to reduce the cost of commercial waste removal.

Researchers from the [[Pondicherry University]] discovered that worm composts can also be used to clean up heavy metals. The researchers found substantial reductions in heavy metals when the worms were released into the garbage and they are effective at removing [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[cadmium]], [[copper]] and [[manganese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

{{Art and video games}}
The concept of '''video games as a form of art''' is a controversial topic within the [[entertainment industry]]. Though [[video game]]s have been afforded legal protection as creative works by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], the philosophical proposition that video games are works of [[art]] remains in question, even when considering the contribution of expressive elements such as graphics, storytelling and music. Even [[art game]]s, games purposely designed to be a work of creative expression, have been challenged as works of art by some critics.&lt;ref name="Parker"&gt;{{cite journal| title=An Art World for Artgames| author=Felan Parker| url=http://journals.sfu.ca/loading/index.php/loading/article/view/119| journal=Loading...| volume=7| issue=11| pages= 54–55| year=2013| publisher=[[Simon Fraser University]]| issn=1923-2691}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest institutional consideration of the video game as an art form came in the late 1980s when art museums began retrospective displays of then outdated [[History of video games (first-generation systems)|first]] and [[History of video games (second generation)|second generation]] games. In exhibitions such as the [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]]'s 1989 "Hot Circuits: A Video Arcade", video games were showcased as preformed works whose quality as art came from the intent of the curator to display them as art.&lt;ref name=stalker&gt;Stalker, Phillipa Jane. ''[http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/handle/10539/1749 Gaming In Art: A Case Study Of Two Examples Of The Artistic Appropriation Of Computer Games And The Mapping Of Historical Trajectories Of 'Art Games' Versus Mainstream Computer Games]''. [[University of the Witwatersrand]], Johannesburg. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Further explorations of this theme were set up in the late 1990s and early 2000s with exhibitions like the [[Walker Art Center]]'s "Beyond Interface" (1998),&lt;ref name=holmes2002&gt;Holmes, Tiffany.

The concept of the video game as a [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]]-style [[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]] or as [[found object]] resonated with early developers of the [[art game]]. In her 2003 [[Digital Arts and Culture]] paper, "Arcade Classics Span Art? Current Trends in the Art Game Genre", professor Tiffany Holmes noted that a significant emerging trend within the [[digital art]] community was the development of playable video game pieces referencing or paying homage to earlier classic works like ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'', ''[[Pac-Man]]'', and ''[[Burgertime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Tiffany.

[[Digital Arts and Culture|Melbourne DAC 2003]]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In modifying the code of simplistic early games or by creating [[art mod]]s for more complex games like ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', the art game genre emerged from the intersection of commercial games and contemporary digital art.&lt;ref name=stalker/&gt;

At the 2010 Art History of Games conference in Atlanta, Georgia, professor [[Celia Pearce]] further noted that alongside Duchamp's art productions, the [[Fluxus]] movement of the 1960s, and most immediately the [[New Games|New Games Movement]] had paved the way for more modern "art games". Works such as Lantz' ''[[Pac-Manhattan|Pac Manhattan]]'', according to Pearce, have become something like performance art pieces.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; Most recently, a strong overlap has developed between art games and [[indie game]]s. This meeting of the art game movement and the indie game movement is important according to Professor Pearce, insofar as it brings art games to more eyes and allows for greater potential to explore in indie games.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

In March 2006, the French [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]] first characterized video games as cultural goods and as "a form of artistic expression," granting the industry a tax subsidy&lt;ref&gt;Crampton, Thomas. ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/06/business/worldbusiness/06game.html For France, Video Games Are as Artful as Cinema]''. [[New York Times]]. 2 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and inducting two French game designers ([[Michel Ancel]], [[Frédérick Raynal]]) and one Japanese game designer ([[Shigeru Miyamoto]]) into the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]]. In May 2011, the United States [[National Endowment for the Arts]], in accepting grants for art projects for 2012, expanded the allowable projects to include "interactive games", furthering the recognition of video games as an art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/109835-Games-Now-Legally-Considered-an-Art-Form-in-the-USA | title= Games Now Legally Considered an Art Form (in the USA) | first = John | last = Funk | date = 2011-05-06 | accessdate = 2011-05-06 | publisher = [[Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that video games were protected speech like other forms of art in the June 2011 decision for ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]''. In Germany, prior to August 2018, the [[Unterhaltungssoftware Selbstkontrolle]] (USK) software ratings body enforced [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|''Strafgesetzbuch'' (German code) section 86a]] as outlined by the German government, which banned the sale of games that contained imagery of extremist groups such as Nazis; while Section 86a allowed for use of these images in artistic and scientific works, video games were not seen to fall within an artistic use. On August 9, 2018, the German government agreed to recognize some of the artistic nature of video games and softened the restriction on Section 86a, allowing the USK to consider games with such imagery as long as they fell within the social adequacy clause of Section 86a.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-08-09-germany-relaxes-stance-on-nazi-symbols-in-video-games | title= Germany relaxes stance on Nazi symbols in video games | first = Matthew | last = Handrahan | date = August 9, 2018 | accessdate = August 9, 2018 | work = [[GamesIndustry.biz]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars tech ban"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/german-ratings-board-starts-allowing-nazi-symbols-in-video-games/ | title = Germany says games with Nazi symbols can get “artistic” exception to ban | first=  Kyle | last= Orland | date = August 10, 2018 | accessdate = August 10, 2018 | work = [[Ars Technica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=dd44ce45-d5cf-4189-a1b6-7bcc7e31605f | title = German Attorney General: Video game with Swastika does not violate the law; constitutes art | first=  Baker | last=McKinsey | date = May 8, 2018 | accessdate = August 10, 2018 | work = [[Lexology]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines between video games and art become blurred when exhibitions fit the labels of both [[game]] and [[interactive art]]. The [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] held an exhibit in 2012, entitled "[[The Art of Video Games]]", which was designed to demonstrate the artistic nature of video games, including the impact of older works and the subsequent influence of video games on creative culture.&lt;ref name="smithsonian exhibit"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/ | title = Exhibitions: The Art of Video Games | publisher = [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] | accessdate = 2011-02-16 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110806051435/http://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/archive/2012/games/ | archive-date = 2011-08-06 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Smithsonian later added ''Flower'' and ''[[Halo 2600]]'', games from this collection, as permanent exhibits within the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/12/17/5222078/smithsonian-acquires-flower-halo-2600-for-its-permanent-collection | title = Smithsonian acquires Flower, Halo 2600 for its permanent collection | publisher = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | first = Michael | last = McWhertor | date = 2013-12-17 | accessdate = 2013-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City [[List of video games in the Museum of Modern Art|aims to collect]] forty historically important video games in their original format to exhibit, showcasing video game interaction design as part of a broader effort to "celebrate gaming as an artistic medium".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/11/moma-videogames/ | title = MoMA to Exhibit Videogames, From Pong to Minecraft | first = Olivia | last = Solon | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | date  = 2012-11-29 | accessdate = 2012-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The annual "[[Into the Pixel]]" art exhibit held at the time of the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] highlights [[video game art]] selected by a panel of both video game and art industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/arts/video-games/pixels-floating-on-the-art-worlds-margins.html | title = Pixels Floating on the Art World’s Margins | first = Harold | last=  Goldberg | date = 2013-06-12 | accessdate = 2013-06-15 | work = [[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empathy games===
{{anchor|Empathy game}}
While many video games are recognized as art for their visual imagery and storytelling, another class of games has gained attention for creating an emotional experience for the player, generally by having the user role-play as a character under a stress-inducing situation, covering topics associated with poverty, sexuality, and physical and mental illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2013/5/9/4313246/gamings-new-frontier-cancer-depression-suicide | title = Gaming's New Frontier: Cancer, Depression, Suicide | first = Colin | last =Campbell | date = May 9, 2013 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324769704579010641205335768 | title = Videogames About Alcoholism, Depression and Cancer | first = Conon | last = Dougherty | date = August 15, 2013 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such games are considered to be examples of an empathy game, loosely described by Patrick Begley of the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' as a game that "asks players to inhabit their character's emotional worlds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/games/empathy-gaming-focuses-on-emotions-and-moral-decisions-20140904-10ch4z.html | title = 'Empathy gaming' focuses on emotions and moral decisions | first = Patrick | last = Begley | date = November 1, 2014 | accessdate = November 15, 2016 | work = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The characterization of games as works of art has been controversial. While recognizing that games may contain artistic elements in their traditional forms such as graphic art, music, and story, several notable figures have advanced the position that games are not artworks, and may never be capable of being called art.

===Legal status===
American courts first began examining the question of whether video games were entitled to constitutional guarantees of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] as under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], in March 1982 in the case of ''America's Best Family Showplace Corp. v. City of New York, Dept. of Bldgs.''&lt;ref&gt;''America's Best Family Showplace Corp. v. City of New York, Dept. of Bldgs.'', 536 F.Supp. 170, D.C.N.Y., 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; In a brace of similarly decided lawsuits in 1982 and 1983, [[precedent]] began to be established for finding that video games were no more expressive than pinball, chess, board- or card-games, or organized sports. This began to change in 2000 as some courts began to make rulings in distinction and carving out narrow exceptions for some ''elements'' of video games.&lt;ref&gt;''American Amusement Mach. Ass'n v. Kendrick'', 115 F.Supp.2d 943 (S.D.Ind.2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 2002, controversy over the topic was still a legal reality as Judge [[Stephen N. Limbaugh, Sr.]], upon reviewing gameplay from "'[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|The Resident of Evil Creek]]'{{sic}}, '[[Mortal Combat]]'{{sic}}, '[[Doom (1993 video game)|DOOM]],' and '[[Fear Effect]]'" ruled in ''Interactive Digital Software Association v. St. Louis County'' that "just like [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]], the Court fails to see how video games express ideas, impressions, feelings, or information unrelated to the game itself".&lt;ref&gt;''Interactive Digital Software Ass'n v. St. Louis County, Mo.'', 200 F.Supp.2d 1126, E.D.Mo.,2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, James. "[http://www.salon.com/2002/05/06/games_as_speech/ Playing games with free speech]". ''Salon''. 6 May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011's ''[[Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n|Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Association]]'' the United States Supreme Court ruled that games are entitled to First Amendment protection, with the majority opinion reading, "Like the protected books, plays, and movies that preceded them, video games communicate ideas—and even social messages—through many familiar literary devices (such as characters, dialogue, plot, and music) and through features distinctive to the medium (such as the player's interaction with the virtual world). That suffices to confer First Amendment protection."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/gaming.gadgets/06/27/supreme.court.video.game.art/|work=CNN|last=Sutter|first=John D.|title=Supreme Court sees video games as art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of legitimation===
Emerging art forms depend upon existing communities for recognition and legitimation, even as they compete with those incumbents for ideological and material support.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; Games have faced suspicion from critics of established media, just as film, television, and comics were once doubted.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; Keith Stewart, games editor for ''[[The Guardian]]'', sees mainstream media as preferring to approach games from the angle of the human stories surrounding them – making indie games with identifiable creators attractive to journalists.&lt;ref name="bizStewart"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2013-03-13-the-first-guardian-keith-stuart-on-getting-games-into-culture|work=gamesindustry.biz|last=Pearson|first=Dan|title=The First Guardian: Keith Stuart on getting games into Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical communities devoted to games have likewise embraced [[auteur theory]] of games' artistic potential as underpinned by the creative visions of sole creators.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; John Lanchester of the ''[[London Review of Books]]'' noted that even as video games become a larger market by revenues compared to films and books, the amount of attention given to video games is generally delegated to a limited set of sources and do not readily enter the "cultural discourse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= John |first=Lanchester |date=January 1, 2009 |title=Is It Art? |url= http://www.lrb.co.uk/v31/n01/john-lanchester/is-it-art  |journal= [[London Review of Books]] |publisher=Nicholas Spice |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=18–20 |doi= |access-date= October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Auteur theory has led to some overlap between indie status and artistic cachet, with critics praising stylistic choices in indie games, when those same choices would be deplored in a commercial game.&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/why-games-matter-indie-movie-fez-meat-427544|work=International Business Times|last=Smith|first=Edward|title=Indie Games Aren't Art Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than defending the medium as a whole, proponents of [[art game]]s attempt to create a separate milieu opposed to video games they accept to be [[low culture]].&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"/&gt; In practice, indie auteurs often receive commercial backing, while mainstream creators such as Shigeru Miyamoto and Peter Molyneux are increasingly viewed as auteurs as well.&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; The conflation of indieness and artistry has been criticized by some, including [[Anna Anthropy]],&lt;ref name="Parker"/&gt; [[Lucy Kellaway]],&lt;ref name="ibtimesArtGames"/&gt; and [[Jim Munroe]],&lt;ref name="sparkMunroe"/&gt; who argue the characteristics that distinguish indie games from the mainstream are not inherently artistic.

Munroe suggested that video games often face a double standard in that if they conform to traditional notions of the game as a toy for children then they are flippantly dismissed as trivial and non-artistic, but if they push the envelope by introducing serious adult themes into games then they face negative criticism and controversy for failing to conform to the very standards of non-artistic triviality demanded by these traditional notions. He further explained games as a type of art more akin to architecture, in which the artist creates a space for the audience to experience on their own terms, than to a non-interactive presentation as in cinema.&lt;ref name="sparkMunroe"&gt;Young, Nora &amp; Misener, Dan. ''[http://www.cbc.ca/spark/2011/10/repeat-of-spark-126-october-16-19-2011 Repeat of Spark 126 – October 16 &amp; 19, 2011: Games as Art]'' (Podcast available: [http://podcast.cbc.ca/spark/plus-spark_20101107_spark126c.mp3 Games as Art] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029074320/http://podcast.cbc.ca/spark/plus-spark_20101107_spark126c.mp3 |date=October 29, 2014 }}). ''[[Spark (radio show)|Spark]]''. 7 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Video game designer [[Kim Swift]] believes games can be artistic but denies that they need to be art in order to have cultural value. She feels video games should aspire to be toys through which adults can exercise their imaginations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/06/kim-swift-interview/|work=WIRED|last=Rigney|first=Ryan|title=Portal Designer Kim Swift Won't Let You Take Her Toys Away}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roger Ebert on video games as art===
The question rose to wide public attention in the mid-2000s when film critic [[Roger Ebert]] participated in a series of controversial debates and published colloquies. In 2005, following an online discussion concerning whether or not knowledge of the game ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' was essential to a proper appreciation of the film ''[[Doom (film)|Doom]]'' (which Ebert had awarded one star) as a commentary on the game,&lt;ref name=moriarty&gt;Moriarty, Brian; Caoili, Eric (ed.). ''[http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2011/03/opinion_brian_moriartys_apolog.php Opinion: Brian Moriarty's Apology For Roger Ebert]''. [[GameSetWatch]]. 15 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert described video games as a non-artistic medium incomparable to the more established art forms:

{{quote|text=To my knowledge, no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with the great dramatists, poets, filmmakers, novelists and composers. That a game can aspire to artistic importance as a visual experience, I accept. But for most gamers, video games represent a loss of those precious hours we have available to make ourselves more cultured, civilized and empathetic.|sign=[[Roger Ebert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/why-did-the-chicken-cross-the-genders | title = Why did the chicken cross the genders? | date = 2005-11-27 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | work =[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | first = Roger | last = Ebert }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2006, Ebert took part in a panel discussion at the [[Conference on World Affairs]] entitled "An Epic Debate: Are Video Games an Art Form?" in which he stated that video games don't explore the meaning of being human as other art forms do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url  = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060418/SCANNERS/60418001 | title = Video games: The 'epic debate' | first  =Jim | last =Emerson | date = 2006-04-16 | accessdate =2010-08-31 | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | title = An Epic Debate: Are Video Games an Art Form? | conference = 62nd Annual Conference on World Affairs | conferenceurl = http://www.colorado.edu/cwa/search_results.html?date=7&amp;year=2006 | date = 2006-04-13 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | first = Roger | last = Ebert }}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, in response to comments from [[Clive Barker]] on the panel discussion, Ebert further noted that video games present a malleability that would otherwise ruin other forms of art. As an example, Ebert posed the idea of a version of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' that would allow for an optional happy ending. Such an option, according to Ebert, would weaken the artistic expression of the original work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070721/COMMENTARY/70721001 | title=  Games vs. Art: Ebert vs. Barker  | date = 2007-07-21 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | first = Roger | last = Ebert | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2010, Ebert published an essay, dissecting a presentation made by [[Kellee Santiago]] of [[thatgamecompany]] at the 2009 [[TED (conference)|Technology Entertainment Design Conference]], where he again claimed that games can never be art, due to their rules and goal-based interactivity.&lt;ref name="ebert gamesart"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html | title = Video games can never be art | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | first = Roger | last = Ebert | date = 2010-04-16 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111010001841/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html | archive-date = 2011-10-10 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=One obvious difference between art and games is that you can win a game. It has rules, points, objectives, and an outcome. Santiago might cite a [''[[sic]]''] immersive game without points or rules, but I would say then it ceases to be a game and becomes a representation of a story, a novel, a play, dance, a film. Those are things you cannot win; you can only experience them.|sign=[[Roger Ebert]]&lt;ref name="ebert gamesart"/&gt;}}

Ebert's essay was strongly criticized by the gaming community,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.fastcompany.com/1621426/game-designer-kellee-santiago-responds-to-roger-eberts-video-games-are-not-art-rant | title= Game Designer Kellee Santiago Responds to Roger Ebert's "Video Games Are Not Art" Rant  | first = Dan | last = Nosowitz | date = 2010-04-20 | accessdate =2010-08-31 | publisher = [[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/underwire/2010/04/alt-text-videogames-as-art/ | title = Alt Text: Are Videogames Art?

Moving On… [My Response to Ebert] | first = Kellee | last = Santiago | date =2010-04-19 | accessdate = 2010-08-31 | publisher = [[thatgamecompany]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert later amended his comments in 2010, conceding that games may indeed be art in a non-traditional sense, that he had enjoyed playing ''[[Cosmology of Kyoto]]'', and addressing some replies to his original arguments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/okay_kids_play_on_my_lawn.html |title=Okay, kids, play on my lawn |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2010-08-31 |work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |first=Roger |last=Ebert |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811003526/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/okay_kids_play_on_my_lawn.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ebert did not engage with the issue again and his view remains mired in controversy, the notion that video games are ineligible to be considered [[fine art]] due to their commercial appeal and structure as choice-driven narratives has proved persuasive for many including video game luminary [[Brian Moriarty]] who in March 2011 gave a lecture on the topic entitled ''An [[Apologetics|Apology]] For Roger Ebert''.&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; In this lecture Moriarty emphasized that video games are merely an extension of traditional rule-based games and that there has been no call to declare games like [[Chess]] and [[Go (game)|Go]] to be art. He went on to argue that art in the sense that [[Romanticism|Romantics]] like Ebert, [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], and he were concerned with (i.e. fine art or sublime art) is exceptionally rare and that Ebert was being consistent by declaring video games to be without artistic merit inasmuch as Ebert had previously claimed that "Hardly any movies are art."&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; Moriarty decried the modern expansion of the definition of "art" to include [[low art]], comparing video games to [[kitsch]] and describing aesthetic appreciation of video games as [[Camp (style)|camp]]. After addressing the corrupting influence of commercial forces in [[indie games]] and the difficulty of setting out to create art given the "slippery" tools that game designers must work with, Moriarty concluded that ultimately it was the fact that player choices were presented in games that structurally invalidated the application of the term "art" to video games as the audience's interaction with the work wrests control from the author and thereby negates the expression of art.&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt; This lecture was in turn criticized sharply by noted video game designer, [[Zach Gage]].&lt;ref name=moriarty/&gt;

===Other notable critics===
In a 2006 interview with ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine|US Official PlayStation 2 Magazine]]'', game designer [[Hideo Kojima]] agreed with Ebert's assessment that video games are not art. Kojima acknowledged that games may contain artwork, but he stressed the intrinsically popular nature of video games in contrast to the niche interests served by art. Since the highest ideal of all video games is to achieve 100% player satisfaction whereas art is targeted to at least one person, Kojima argued that video game creation is more of a service than an artistic endeavor.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Ellie. ''[http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news240106kojimaart Games aren't art, says Kojima]''. Eurogamer. 24 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2010 Art History of Games conference, Michael Samyn and Auriea Harvey (founding members of indie studio [[Tale of Tales (developer)|Tale of Tales]]), argued in no uncertain terms that games "are not art" and that they are by and large "a waste of time." Central to Tale of Tales' distinction between games and art is the purposive nature of games as opposed to art: Whereas humans possess a biological need that is only satisfied by [[Play (activity)|play]], argues Samyn, and as play has manifested itself in the form of [[game]]s, games represent nothing more than a physiological necessity. Art, on the other hand, is not created out of a physical need but rather it represents a search for higher purposes. Thus the fact that a game acts to fulfill the physical needs of the player is sufficient, according to Samyn, to disqualify it as art.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

Gamers were surprised by this controversial stance due to the frequency of prior third-party characterizations of Tale of Tales' productions as "art games," however Tale of Tales clarified that the games they were making simply expanded the conception of games. The characterization of their games as "art games," noted Samyn, was merely a byproduct of the imaginative stagnation and lack of progressivism in the video game industry. While Tale of Tales acknowledged that old media featuring one-way communication was not enough, and that two-way communication via computers offers the way forward for art, the studio argued that such communication today is being held hostage by the [[video game industry]].&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; To enable and foment this futuristic two-way art, suggests Tale of Tales, the concept of "the game" must be eviscerated by games that do not fit within the current paradigm and then "life must be breathed into the carcass" through the creation of artworks Samyn and Harvey refer to as "not games."&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

In 2011, Samyn further refined his argument that games are not art by emphasizing the fact that games are systematic and rule-based. Samyn identified an industry emphasis on [[gameplay mechanics]] as directly responsible for the marginalization of artistic narrative in games and he described modern video games as little more than digital sport. Pointing to systemic problems, Samyn criticized the current model whereby the putative artist must work through a large and highly efficient [[Video game development|development team]] who may not share the artist's vision. However, Samyn does not reject the idea that games, as a medium, can be used to create art. To create art using the medium of the video game Samyn suggests that the artistic message must precede the means of its expression in the guidance of gameplay mechanics, the development of "[[fun]]ness" or economic considerations must cease to guide the work's creation, and the development process must embrace a model wherein a single artist-author's vision gains central primacy.&lt;ref&gt;Samyn, Michael.

In 2012, ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' art critic [[Jonathan Jones (journalist)|Jonathan Jones]] published an article arguing that games are more like a playground and not art. Jones also notes that the nature of creating video games robs "one person’s reaction to life" and that "no one owns the game, so there is no artist, and therefore no work of art."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2012/nov/30/moma-video-games-art|title=Sorry MoMA, video games are not art|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|date=2012-11-30|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, video game journalist Patricia Hernandez described a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]] in the [[interactive fiction]] game ''[[Photopia]]''. The solution of the puzzle involves a [[Reveal (narrative)|reveal]] regarding the player's controlled [[Player character|playable character]], prompting experiences which Hernandez argues could not be made "as powerful as they are" in any other art form without interactivity. Hernandez says that narrations in the interactive medium happen in the [[First-person narrative|first person]] and the [[present tense]], which are "fundamental (and often misunderstood) elements of the interactive medium".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nightmaremode.thegamerstrust.com/2013/01/19/a-moment-of-perfect-beauty/|title=A Moment of Perfect Beauty|date=2013-01-19|work=Nightmare Mode [Archived]|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8972">The '''Vipassanā-ñāṇas''' ([[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]]: Vipaśyanā-jñāna) or  '''insight knowledges''' are various stages that a practitioner of Buddhist [[Vipassanā]] ("insight", "clear-seeing") meditation is said to pass through on the way to [[nibbana]].&lt;ref&gt;Mahasi Sayadaw, the Progress of insight&lt;/ref&gt; This "progress of insight" (''Visuddhiñana-katha'') is outlined in various traditional [[Theravada Buddhist]] commentary texts such as the [[Patisambhidamagga]], the [[Vimuttimagga]] and the [[Visuddhimagga]]. In [[Sarvastivadin]] [[abhidharma]] texts, the "path of insight" (darśana-mārga) one of the [[Bh%C5%ABmi_(Buddhism)#Five_Paths|five paths]] of progress in the dharma and is made up of several ''jñānas'' also called "thought moments".

==Vimuttimagga==
The [[Vimuttimagga]] (Path to liberation, 解脫道論) is an early meditation manual by the [[arahant]] Upatissa preserved only in a sixth century Chinese translation. The stages of insight outlined by the Vimuttimagga are:&lt;ref&gt;Analayo, The Dynamics of Theravāda Insight Meditation.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Comprehension (廣觀)
#Rise and fall (起滅)
#Dissolution (滅)
#Fear &amp; disadvantage &amp; disenchantment (畏 &amp; 過患 &amp; 厭離)
#Delight in deliverance &amp; equanimity (樂解脫 &amp; 捨)
#Conformity (相似)

A similar presentation of these stages can be found in the [[Patisambhidamagga]] (dated between the 3rd century BCE to the 2nd century CE), an [[Abhidhamma]] work included in the fifth Nikāya of the [[Pāli Canon]]. In the [[Patisambhidamagga]], there are only 5 stages presented. The first three stages are the same and the last two are "fear &amp; disadvantage" (bhaya &amp; ādīnava) and "wish for deliverance &amp; equanimity towards formations" (muñcitukamyatā &amp; saṅkhārupekkhā).&lt;ref&gt;Analayo, The Dynamics of Theravāda Insight Meditation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visuddhimagga==
[[Buddhagosa]]'s [[Visuddhimagga]] (Path of purification) (ca. 430 CE), while seemingly influenced by the [[Vimuttimagga]], divides the insight knowledges further into sixteen stages:&lt;ref&gt;Vipassanadhura meditation society http://www.vipassanadhura.com/sixteen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

#''Namarupa pariccheda ñana'' - Knowledge of mental and physical states, analytical knowledge of body and mind.
#''Paccaya pariggaha ñana'' - Discerning Conditionality, knowledge of cause and effect between mental and physical states.
#''Sammasana ñana'' - Knowledge of the [[three characteristics]] of mental and physical processes.
#''Udayabbaya ñana'' - Knowledge of arising and passing away. Accompanied by possible mental images/lights, [[Pīti|rapture]], [[sukha|happiness]], tranquility and strong [[mindfulness]] so that "there is no body-and-mind process in which mindfulness fails to engage."  &lt;ref&gt;Mahasi Sayadaw, the Progress of insight&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Bhanga ñana'' - Knowledge of the dissolution of formations, only the "vanishing," or "passing away" is discernible.
#''Bhaya ñana'' - Knowledge of the fearful nature of mental and physical states. The meditator's mind "is gripped by fear and seems helpless."&lt;ref&gt;Mahasi Sayadaw, the Progress of insight&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Adinava ñana'' - Knowledge of mental and physical states as [[dukkha]]. "So he sees, at that time, only suffering, only unsatisfactoriness, only misery." &lt;ref&gt;Mahasi Sayadaw, the Progress of insight&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Nibbida ñana'' - Knowledge of disenchantment/disgust with conditioned states.
#''Muncitukamayata ñana'' - Knowledge of Desire for Deliverance, the desire to abandon the worldly state (for nibbana) arises.
#''Patisankha ñana'' - Knowledge of re-investigation of the path. This instills a decision to practice further.
#''Sankharupekha ñana'' - Knowledge which regards mental and physical states with [[upekkha|equanimity]].
#''Anuloma ñana'' - Knowledge in conformity with the [[Four Noble Truths]].
#''Gotrabhu ñana''- Knowledge which is void of [[sankhara|conditioned formations]], "maturity Knowledge".
#''Magga ñana'' - Knowledge by which [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements]] are abandoned and are overcome by destruction.
#''Phala ñana'' - Knowledge which realizes the fruit of the path ([[nibbana]]).
#''Paccavekkhana ñana'' - Knowledge which reviews the [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|defilements]] still remaining.

==Abhidhammattha-sangaha==
In the [[Abhidhammattha-sangaha]] (11th to 12th century), another widely used Buddhist commentarial text, there are only ten insight knowledges.&lt;ref&gt;Analayo, The Dynamics of Theravāda Insight Meditation.&lt;/ref&gt;

#Comprehension - ''sammasana''
#Rise and fall - ''udayabbaya''
#Dissolution - ''bhaṅga''
#Fear - ''bhaya''
#Disadvantage - ''ādīnava''
#Disenchantment - ''nibbidā''
#Wish for deliverance - ''muñcitukamyatā''
#Reflection - ''paṭisaṅkhā''
#Equanimity towards formations - ''saṅkhārupekkhā''
#Conformity - ''anuloma

==Sarvastivadin Abhidharma texts==
The Abhidharma-mahā-vibhāṣa-śāstra presents 'the process of the direct insight into the four truths' as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Yiu-wing;An English translation of the Dharmatrta-Dhyna Sutra, http://ibc.ac.th/faqing/files/English_Translation_ofBuddhabhadra_Meditation_Sutra.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Visual Privacy''' is the relationship between collection and dissemination of visual information, the public [[expectation of privacy]], and the legal issues surrounding them.  In particular, large-scale camera networks have created increasing interest in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of such deployments.  It is estimated that over 4 Million Cameras Deployed in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;McCahill, M. and Norris, C. 2004, From cameras to control rooms: the mediation of the image by cctv operatives, CCTV  and Social Control: The politics and practice of video surveillance-European and global perspectives, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to increasing security concerns, camera networks have continued to proliferate across other countries such as the United States.  While the impact of such systems continues to be evaluated, in parallel, tools for controlling how these camera networks are used and modifications to the images or video sent to end-users have been explored.

==Technologies==

To combat surveillance, a number of different technologies have been suggested.

===Forms of Visual Data===
Visual Privacy is often typically applied to particular technologies including
* [[Closed-circuit television]] (CCTVs)
* [[Visual sensor network]] (Also referred to as Camera Networks)
* [[Camera phone]]

===Systems===
Many different forms of technologies are explored to preserve privacy while providing information collected from camera networks:
* [http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jschiff/RespectfulCameras/index.html Respectful Cameras] is a solution that automatically obscures the faces of observed people in video by overlaying a colored dot over the face of the individual.  This technology tracks colored markers, worn by individuals, and then infers the location of a face by an offset from the marker.&lt;ref&gt;Respectful Cameras: Detecting Visual Markers in Real-Time to Address Privacy Concerns.

==Differences from other load-carrying bicycles==
While the Xtracycle is based on a standard [[Bicycle suspension|hardtail]] [[diamond frame]] with 26-inch or 622&amp;nbsp;mm (700c) wheels, the Xtracycle differs from other load-carrying bicycles in that it does not employ a [[Bicycle handlebar|handlebar]] basket, [[pannier]]s, or a [[bicycle trailer]]. Baskets are easy to attach and allow stowing of cargo in plain view. Panniers are often watertight or water resistant, and can be easily removed from their racks and carried as luggage. While trailers come in many designs and allow a bicycle to pull a significant amount of cargo, an Xtracycle allows for more stowage of large containers directly on the extended frame of the bicycle itself. Xtracycles are also called "sport utility bicycles" for their ability to carry larger loads than a normal bicycles having baskets or panniers, while also maintaining the "sporty" maneuverability of conventional "short" bikes.

==History and spin-offs==
The FreeRadical was conceived by Ross Evans at [[Stanford University]] and developed during his work in the mid-1990s managing a "[[Bikes Not Bombs]]" project in [[Nicaragua]], where having a bicycle enhances a person's employment opportunities. In 1998 Evans and his friend Kipchoge Spencer created Xtracycle Inc to manufacture and market the invention, as well as a nonprofit organization, Worldbike, devoted to encourage a bicycle-centric lifestyle and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Retherford, Brittany. [http://www.theunion.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006101120147 One step at a time: Duo's film, innovations geared to a healthier world] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030509/http://www.theunion.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006101120147 |date=September 27, 2007 }}. ''The Union'', (January 12, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that the FreeRadical qualifies as an aftermarket bike accessory, its growing acceptance has sparked an Xtracycle aftermarket not formally connected with Xtracycle Inc: varieties of [https://web.archive.org/web/20060902052655/http://www.rideyourbike.com/xtracycle.html specialized kickstands], [http://clevercycles.com/cleverchimp-stokemonkey-human-electric-hybrid-drive electric-assist motors], and even bike-mounted blenders have come to market, even though each requires the prior purchase of a FreeRadical or other Xtracycle-compatible frame to function properly.

===Big Dummy===
[[File:Surly Big Dummy.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Surly Big Dummy]] with handlebars and foot rests for a second rider]]
Xtracycle Inc has worked with various bicycle manufacturers to build purpose-built extended bicycles compatible with their accessories.  The first to actually produce and market an integrated Xtracycle frameset was [[Surly Bikes]] with the Big Dummy.&lt;ref name="startrib"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; XInc continues to form similar covenants with manufacturers in all price ranges, with the goal of making the Xtracycle less of a niche product and more mainstream. XInc is also working on FreeRadical attachments sized for children's and youths' bicycles on the theory of "catch 'em young and train 'em right."

Other applications for the FreeRadical have included linking two Xtracycles to support a mobile stage for use in parades and street fairs, and a computerized chalkpowder-printer device mounted on an Xtracycle that leaves a dot-matrix trail of messages on the street.&lt;ref&gt;Kinberg, Joshua. [http://www.bikesagainstbush.com/blog/video.html Bikes Against Bush "Maiden Voyage" Video] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323112349/http://www.bikesagainstbush.com/blog/video.html |date=March 23, 2007 }}, (August 1, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open source===
In 2008, Xtracycle put their longtail bike frame specifications online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.commutebybike.com/2008/10/01/xtracycle-open-source-specs-now-online/

| date = August 1, 2008
| accessdate = 2013-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of their project to open source their longtail frame design. They’ve created a Longtail Standard and logoing to allow vendors to design their products to fit in the Xtracycle FreeRadical ecosystem. The "Longtail Technology" logo can be used on bikes, accessories or packaging. The [[open source|open sourcing]] of the patented technology was meant to stimulate the cargo bike movement, while developing a standard for "longtail" frames and accessories. Several frame and accessory makers have adopted the standards, while others have developed competing and incompatible long-frame cargo bike designs.
However, the documents are no longer freely available, and now require an agreement with Xtracycle first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
