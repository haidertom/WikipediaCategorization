The '''Alphabet Synthesis Machine''' (2002) is a work of [[interactive art]] which makes use of [[genetic algorithm]]s to "evolve" a set of glyphs similar in appearance to a real-world alphabet. Users create initial glyphs and the program takes over. As the creators of the project put it, their goal was "to bring about the specific feeling of semi-sense one experiences when one recognizes—- but cannot read—- the unfamiliar writing of another culture."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alphabetsynthesis.com/#background&lt;/ref&gt; The project was developed by [[Golan Levin]], a new-media artist, in collaboration with [[Cassidy Curtis]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2003/12/61720?currentPage=2&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jonathan Feinberg]].

'''An Honest Thief''' ({{lang-ru|Честный вор}}, ''Chestny vor'') is an 1848 short story by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]. The story recounts the tale of the tragic [[drunkard]],  Emelyan Ilyitch.

== Synopsis ==
The story opens with the narrator taking on a lodger in his apartment, an old soldier named Astafy Ivanovich. One day, a thief steals the narrator's coat, and Astafy tries to pursue him unsuccessfully. Astafy is dismayed by the theft and goes over the scenario over and over again. The narrator and Astafy share a distinct contempt for thieves, and one night Astafy tells the narrator a story of an honest thief that he had once run across.

One night in a pub, Astafy Ivanovich happened upon Emelyan Ilyitch. The two knew each other on beforehand, but now Emelyan was obviously poor from the look of his tattered coat. He was aching for a drink but had not the money. Astafy was moved by Emelyan's acutely pathetic position, and he bought him a drink. From then on, Emelyan followed Astafy everywhere, eventually moving into his apartment. Astafy did not have much money himself, but he allowed Emelyan's imposition because he was very aware that his drinking was a terrible problem. Emelyan would not stop his drinking, however, and even though he was quiet and not disruptive when he was drunk, Astafy could see that Emelyan would never be able to support himself with such a habit. Astafy urged him to quit drinking, but to no avail.  Eventually, Astafy effectively gave up on him and moved, never expecting to see Emelyan again.

Very soon after Astafy had moved Emelyan appears at his new apartment, and the two continue to go on as they had before. Astafy would support Emelyan with food and lodging, and Emelyan would always go out and come back drunk. Sometimes he would disappear for days only to return drunk and almost frozen.

Astafy, now working as a tailor, was short on money. One of his projects, a pair of riding breeches for a wealthy customer, were never claimed. He thought he could sell the breeches to get money for more useful clothes and some food, but when he decided to sell the breeches, they were nowhere to be found. Emelyan was drunk as usual, and denied the theft. Astafy was terribly vexed by the theft, and kept looking for the breeches while still suspicious of Emelyan.  Emelyan always denied the theft.

One day, Astafy and Emelyan had a terrible fight over the breeches and Emelyan's drinking, and Emelyan left the apartment and did not return for days. Astafy even went to look for him one day with no luck. Eventually, after a couple of days, Emelyan returned, almost starved and frozen.  Astafy took him back in, but it was clear that Emelyan's days were numbered. Days later, after Emelyan's health had deteriorated terribly, Emelyan wanted to tell Astafy something about the breeches. With his last words, Emelyan admitted to stealing the breeches.

'''Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait''' (February 5, 1819{{snd}}April 28, 1905) was a British-American artist who is known mostly for his paintings of wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CkUAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=American Art Annual, Volume 5 | publisher=MacMillan Company | year=1905 | pages=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; During most of his career, he was associated with the [[New York City]] art scene.

==Life and career==
[[File:Rabbits on a Log MET DT4921.jpg|thumb|right|''Rabbits on a Log'', Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]
Tait was born in [[Livesey|Livesey Hall]] near [[Liverpool]], [[England]]. 
At eight years old, because his father went bankrupt he was sent to live with relatives in [[City of Lancaster|Lancaster]]. It is during that time that he became attached to animals. Later on, in [[Manchester|Manchester, England]], Agnew &amp; Zanetti Repository of Art acquired Arthur Tait who began self-learning to paint, as a twelve-year-old boy.&lt;ref name=Heritage&gt;Chisholm, Nan, Noelle DeSantis &amp; James L. Halperin. ''Heritage Galleries &amp; Auctioneers American Art Signature Auction #604'', Heritage Capital Corporation. p. 11. {{ISBN|1-932899-31-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His work consisted mostly of reproduced lithography that were exposed for Agnew's exhibitions. In 1838, he left the Agnew lithography reproduction business to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait | work=Russell Fink Gallery | url=http://store.russellfinkgallery.com/taarfi.html | accessdate=2006-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1840s he became aware of the Americas while attending a [[George Catlin]] exhibition in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait |work=The National Museum of Wildlife Art |url=http://www.wildlifeart.org/Collections/ArtistBio.cfm?tArtistid=271&amp;tUrl=/events/index.cfm&amp;UrlName=Main_Events_Page |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927232605/http://www.wildlifeart.org/Collections/ArtistBio.cfm?tArtistid=271&amp;tUrl=%2Fevents%2Findex.cfm&amp;UrlName=Main_Events_Page |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-09-27 |accessdate=2006-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He immigrated to the [[United States]] in 1850, where he established a small painting camp in the [[Adirondacks]] to paint during summer. Starting in 1852, Currier &amp; Ives reproduced [[lithographies]] of his works to publicize him. What also promoted his talent was exhibitions held at the [[National Academy of Design]], New York during the late 19th century showing more than 200 paintings of his. 
In 1858 he was elected to full membership of the Academy.&lt;ref name=Heritage /&gt;

He was identified with the art life of New York until his death at [[Yonkers, New York]] in 1905. He painted barnyard [[fowl]] and wild [[bird]]s as well as [[sheep]] and [[deer]], with great dexterity, and reproductions of his minute panels of chickens had an enormous vogue.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle= Tait, Arthur Fitzwilliam|volume=26|page=364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Tait's painting ''Good Hunting Ground: The Home of the Deer'' was auctioned for $167,300.

He is interred at [[Woodlawn Cemetery (Bronx)|Woodlawn Cemetery]] in [[the Bronx]], [[New York City]].

The '''Assumption of the Virgin''' ({{lang-it|L'Assunzione della Vergine}}) by [[Annibale Carracci]] is the altarpiece of the famous [[Cerasi Chapel]] in the church of [[Santa Maria del Popolo]] in [[Rome]]. The large [[panel painting]] was created in 1600-1601.&lt;ref&gt;Fondazione Federico Zeri - Catalogo Fototeca [http://catalogo.fondazionezeri.unibo.it/scheda.v2.jsp?tipo_scheda=OA&amp;id=57279&amp;titolo=Carracci%20Annibale,%20Assunzione%20della%20Madonna&amp;locale=it&amp;decorator=layout_resp&amp;apply=true]&lt;/ref&gt; The artwork is somewhat overshadowed by the two more famous paintings of [[Caravaggio]] on the side walls of the chapel: ''[[Conversion on the Way to Damascus|The Conversion of Saint Paul on the Road to Damascus]]'' and ''[[Crucifixion of St. Peter (Caravaggio)|The Crucifixion of Saint Peter]]''. Both painters were important in the development of [[Baroque]] art but the contrast is striking: Carracci's Virgin glows with even light and radiates harmony, while the paintings of Caravaggio are dramatically lit and foreshortened.

== History ==
The chapel in the left transept of the basilica was built by Monsignor [[Tiberio Cerasi]], [[Advocates of Roman Congregations|Consistorial Advocate]] and Treasurer-General to [[Pope Clement VIII]]. He purchased a chapel on the same spot from the Augustinian friars on 8 July 1600 and commissioned [[Carlo Maderno]] to rebuild the small edifice in Baroque style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hibbard | first = Howard | coauthors = | title = Caravaggio | publisher = [[Westview Press]] | date = 1983 | month = | isbn = 0-06-430128-1 | page = 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September Cerasi contracted Caravaggio to paint two panels for the side walls. Presumably another contract was signed at an early stage in the proceedings with Carracci for the altarpiece but this document has not been preserved.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mahon: Egregius in Urbe Pictor: Caravaggio revised, The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 93, No. 580 (Jul., 1951), p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Preparatory studies and sketches by Carracci are preserved in the [[Royal Collection]]. 

The commissions went to the leading artists in Rome at the time: during these years Carracci was busy working on the famous [[The Loves of the Gods|fresco cycle]] of the [[Palazzo Farnese]] for Cardinal [[Odoardo Farnese (cardinal)|Odoardo Farnese]]. Probably due to his increased workload in the palace, the three ceiling frescos in the chapel were executed by his assistant, [[Innocenzo Tacconi]] following Carracci's design. In these circumstances there was little reason for Carracci and Caravaggio to regard each other as business rivals, states [[Denis Mahon]].&lt;ref&gt;Denis Mahon op. cit. p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiberio Cerasi died on 3 May 1601 and was buried in the chapel. In his will he named the Fathers of the Hospital of the Madonna della Consolazione as his heirs with the responsibility to complete the still unfinished chapel.&lt;ref name="Witcombe"&gt;Christopher L. C. E. Witcombe, Two "Avvisi", Caravaggio, and Giulio Mancini, in: Source: Notes in the History of Art, Vol. 12, No. 3 (Spring 1993), pp. 22–29, pag. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Annibale's altarpiece was probably already complete as deduced from an ''avviso'' written perhaps by [[Giulio Mancini]] and dated to 2 June:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The principal painting in the chapel [is] by the said Carracci, those three paintings being, on the whole, of great excellence and beauty."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is also confirmed by the fact that there are no recordings of payments in favor of Carracci in the documents concerning the management of the assets of Tiberio Cerasi drawn up after his death. The chapel was finally consecrated on 11 November 1606.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Nolin, "Non piacquero al Padrone: A Reexamination of Caravaggio's Cerasi Crucifixion of St. Peter, in:Rutgers Art Review 24 (2008), pag. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; It was dedicated to the [[Assumption of Mary]].

== Description ==

[[File:Annibale Carracci e Caravaggio, Cappella Cerasi.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The painting was designed to be looked at as part of a larger ensemble]]The altarpiece is the fulcrum of the decorative program of the chapel due to its subject and spatial position. There is a strong thematic connection with the scene of the ''Coronation of the Virgin'' in the central medaillon of the barrel-vault that shows the final episode in the [[Life of the Virgin]] after the [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]. The painting also establishes a dialog with the two Caravaggio canvasses on the lateral walls: the most important figures among the apostles are [[Saint Peter]] (the older man on the left) and [[Saint Paul]] (on the right) in the foreground whose life story is told by Caravaggio (and also by the side paintings on the vault). The thematic and compositional connections prove that the altarpiece was designed to be looked at as part of a larger ensemble and not as a standalone object.

The rather crowded composition is organized around a triad of figures: the Virgin rising from the empty tomb (surrounded by a retinue of angels) and the two apostles gazing upwards in awe. All three wear robes in bright primary colours: blue over red (Mary), yellow over blue (Peter) and pink over green (Paul). The remaining space around the sarcophagus is filled with nine other apostles, bringing their overall number to eleven. "The stiffened forms and crowded composition [...] have been interpreted as a conscious shift to a 'hyper-idealized' manner that rejects the warmth and painterly qualities of his Bolognese period for a style indebted to ancient sculpture and to [[Raphael]]. Still neither ancient reliefs nor Raphael crowded their pictorial fields in this way", says [[Ann Sutherland Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann Sutherland Harris: Seventeenth-century Art and Architecture, Laurence King Publishing, London, 2005, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting largely follows the iconographic tradition concerning the depiction of the Assumption in [[Western painting|Western art]]. John the Evangelist (on the left) is portrayed as a beardless young man among the older and bearded apostles. One member of the angelic retinue can be identified as [[Archangel Michael]] who lifted up Mary's body to heaven. An apostle on the right is looking at the grave linens and the roses that were found in the empty sarcophagus.&lt;ref&gt;Peter and Linda Murray: The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture, Oxford University Press, 1996, p. 38
&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand the prominent position of the ''principes apostolorum'' is a nod to local sensitivities.

Mary seems to be projecting forward rather than upwards. It is a device that compensates for the confined environment and the rather low position of the altar. In this way, the Assumption meets the observer far beyond the narrow space of the Cerasi Chapel, ensuring its visibility from the transept, an ideal space for the continuation of Mary's motion. The dynamism, the emotional charge and the integration of the painting into real space are strongly innovative elements which make the panel unequaled among the contemporary altarpieces produced in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Tomaso Montanari, Il Barocco, Torino, 2012, pp. 34-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==

[[File:Tizian 041.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Titian's Assumption]]A supposed model for the central figure is the Virgin of the ''Assumption'' by [[Giuseppe Valeriano]] and [[Scipione Pulzone]] in the [[Church of the Gesù]].&lt;ref&gt;Claudio Strinati, L'Assunzione della Vergine di Annibale Carracci, in Maria Grazia Bernardini (a cura di), Caravaggio Carracci Maderno. La cappella Cerasi in Santa Maria del Popolo a Roma, Cinisello Balsamo, 2001, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; An even more important antecedent for the panel is the [[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]] of [[Raphael]], a masterpiece that Carracci much loved and studied. That Carracci took inspiration for the lighting - a strong spotlight effect giving a sculptural look to the forms -  from Raphael, becomes clear if compare the figure of Saint Peter with the Saint Peter in the same location on the Transfiguration.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine E. Kopp: “The Carracci and Venice: Annibale Carracci's stylistic response to Venetian art, and the intermediate roles of Ludovico and Agostino Carracci, thesis, Queen's University, 2014, p.237&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|Assumption of the Virgin]] by [[Titian]] was another great Renaissance painting that may have influenced Carracci while working on the same subject, especially regarding the heads of some of the apostles in deep shadow and in ''profil perdu''.

The relationship between the paintings of Caravaggio and Carracci in the chapel is a perpetual subject of discussion in art history. It seems probable that each artist "subtly altered his style of painting as a result of this direct confrontation with the other", and "Annibale's monumental saints, whose
hands and feet seem to pierce the picture plane" may have influenced Caravaggio.&lt;ref&gt;Kate Ganz: Annibale's Rome: Art and Life in the Eternal City, in The Drawings of Annibale Carracci, National Gallery of Art, Washington, 1999, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cerasi Assumption was a turning point in Annibale's painting style as his compositions became darker, the figures larger and more monumental during the last phase of his career. Donald Posner termed his style in this period 'hyper-idealized'.

The painting was not regarded among Carracci's best works by his two 17th-century biographers. [[Giovanni Pietro Bellori]] only mentions it shortly when listing the late works of the artist while [[Carlo Cesare Malvasia]] is even more dismissive.&lt;ref&gt;Malvasia's Life of the Carracci: Commentary and Translation, trans. by Anne Summerscale, The Pennsylvania State University Press, 2000, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Modern art history showed more appreciation. "The visual effects ensured that the spectators in the chapel space experienced for themselves the onrush of divine energy as the Virgin soared from the tomb, outward and over their heads into the painted vault of the crossing, where the actual Coronation was painted", says Rosemary Muir Wright. "The Virgin herself had become an icon of ideal beauty in a form which owed much of its perfection to the model of Raphael. This idealization provided the necessary reminder of the supernatural nature of the event, despite the obvious visual conviction of natural form and three-dimensional space."&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Muir Wright: Sacred Distance: Representing the Virgin Mary in Italian Altarpieces, 1300-1630, Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life &amp; Musical Training==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=May 2016}}
Atul Sharma started his musical education at early age, and received vocal training in Indian Classical Music from Mr. P.D. Chandan in Kalka (Haryana, India) at the age of 11.

After finishing his masters, he taught Indian classical music at the Panjab University for seven years, before becoming a full-time music composer.

==Career==

===Punjabi Music===

He started composing music in the early 1980s, and his first Punjabi album was of the singer [[Hakam Sufi]], titled "Mela Yaaran Da". From there he went on to compose music for numerous albums for artistes like [[Hans Raj Hans]], [[Sardool Sikander]], [[Kuldip Manak]], [[Gurdas Maan]], as well as Punjabi movies like "Jatt Jeaona Mour" (1991)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ravi|first1=Ravinder|title=Jatt Jeona Mor (1991)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316054/|website=imdb.com|publisher=imdb.com|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Badla Jatti Da" (1991), delivering many multi platinum selling albums on the way.

====Surjit Bindrakhia====

During this time, he mentored a then young and raw singer [[Surjit Bindrakhia]]. Along with the lyricist Samsher Singh Sandhu, the three formed perhaps one of most legendary and finest team in Punjabi music. Starting from Bindrakhia's first album "Munda Ki Mangda", which became widely popular in Punjab, the trio delivered some of Punjabi music's most popular music ever. The Success of the first album carried forward with the massive hit "Bas Kar Bas Kar" in 1992, and then "Dupatta Tera Satt Rang Da" in 1994 which established Bindrakhia as the global superstar of Punjabi Music. The single "Dupatta Tera Satt Rang Da" went on to top the UK music Charts for numerous weeks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dhillon|first1=Noor|title=Tribute to Surjit Bindrakhia|url=http://www.punjabiportal.com/articles/tribute-to-surjit-bindrakhia|website=punjabiportal.com|publisher=Punjabi Portal|accessdate=11 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610040201/http://www.punjabiportal.com/articles/tribute-to-surjit-bindrakhia|archive-date=10 June 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became one of the first Punjabi songs to sell a million copies in the UK. For the same album, Atul Sharma was presented a platinum record at the Wembley Arena in the honour of the albums record breaking success. This success was followed by further hits like "Lakk tunu tunu", "Mukhda deke ke", "Billiyan Akhiyan", "Saanu tedi tedi takhdi tun", "Peke hunde maawan naal" and "Yaar Bolda", a song that has reached a cult status in Punjabi folk music the world over.

Almost all the albums produced by this trio, went on to achieve commercial success in India as well as the Western markets of the UK, Canada, and the US. Their hugely successful trio, delivered record sales of over 250 million copies in total, out of which over 100 million came from outside India.

====Harjit Harman====

Similar to his success with Bindrakhia, Atul Sharma mentored [[Harjit Harman]] and their partnership with lyricist Pargat Singh has yielded some of the biggest hits in recent history. The album "Punjebaan" received great commercial as well as well critical success, with the Title track "Punjebaan" and "Mitran da naa chalda" becoming super-hits all over the world. His further albums were also highly acclaimed and commercially successful with "Hoor", "Mundri", "Jhanjhar", and the most recent single "Jatti" being the stand out records. He received the award for the "Best Music Director" at [[PTC Music Awards]] for the song "Mitran da naa chalda" in 2005, and then for the song "Jatti" in 2015. "Jatti" was also given the award for the "Best Folk Oriented Song".

====Other Artistes====

Apart from his association with Bindrakhia and Harjit Harman, Atul Sharma has composed music for nearly all the eminent artistes like:

* [[Kuldip Manak]]
* [[Surinder Shinda]]
* [[Gurdas Maan]]
* [[Hans Raj Hans]]

'''Baibakov Art Projects''' is a non-profit organization that aims to provide platforms for cultural production primarily within [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="The Daily Telegraph 4-11-08"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/artsales/3562621/Art-sales-the-heiress-and-the-chocolate-factory.html| title= Art sales: the heiress and the chocolate factory| publisher=The Daily Telegraph| date=28 October 2008 | location=London | first=Colin | last=Gleadell | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Founded in 2008, the initiative was the first to make use of the former Red October Chocolate Factory in the center of Moscow. Baibakov Art Projects inaugurated its 3000m2 space with an exhibition called [[invasion : evasion]],&lt;ref name="Baibakov Art Projects Opens an Exhibition of Young Russian Artists"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.artdaily.com/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=27853&amp;int_modo=2| title= Baibakov Art Projects Opens an Exhibition of Young Russian Artist| publisher=ArtDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt; which challenged 22 Russian artists and collectives (including Gosha Ostretsov, Ira Korina, Dmitry Teselkin and Alina Gutkina) to launch a creative invasion of the exhibition space.  It followed this exhibition with "Natural Wonders: New Art from London," a show which likewise featured a showcase of 22 artists and collectives based in London (among them Idris Khan, Conrad Shawcross, Ryan Gander and Shezad Dawood.) Later, Baibakov Art Projects would go on to host exhibitions of artists like [[Luc Tuymans]], Paul Pfeiffer, and [[Olga Chernysheva]] as well as group shows like FIVE, which featured Walead Beshty, Matthew Brannon, Wade Guyton, Sterling Ruby and Kelley Walker.

In April 2010, Baibakov Art Projects relocated to a former House of Culture at Paveletskaya Naberezhnaya 2/18, where it hosted the exhibition [[Perpetual Battles]],&lt;ref name="48 Hours in Moscow"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.openingceremony.us/entry.asp?pid=856| title= I'll Take You There: 48 Hours in Moscow| publisher=Opening Ceremony| date=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; curated by Baibakova with Kate Sutton and Jean-Max Colard.&lt;ref&gt;Chou, Kimberly.

Accessed August 1, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The show featured work by artists including Thomas Hirschhorn, Cyprien Gaillard, Latifa Echakhch and Saadane Afif. Concurrently, Baibakov Art Projects hosted [[032c's Workshop Report]]&lt;ref name="Dazed Digital"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/7978/1/baibakov-art-projects-x-032c-workshop| title= Baibakov Art Projects x 032c Workshop | publisher=Dazed Digital}}&lt;/ref&gt; an exhibition that displayed works by Cyprien Gaillard, Andro Wekua, Gosha Rubchinskiy and Carsten Holler on Konstatin Grcic tables, set up on a Missoni carpet.  Following the exhibition, Baibakov Art Projects began to operate using pop-up spaces, such as Dom Spiridonov, where they hosted a launch for [[Visionaire's Fairy Tales]]&lt;ref name="V Magazine"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vmagazine.com/2010/10/visionaire-59-fairytale-launch-in-moscow |title=Visionaire 59 Fairytale Launch in Moscow |publisher=V Magazine |date=1 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024185936/http://www.vmagazine.com/2010/10/visionaire-59-fairytale-launch-in-moscow/ |archivedate=24 October 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; in October 2010.

{{Communist Romania}}

'''Ceaușescu's speech of 21 August 1968''' was a public address by [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]], [[General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party|General Secretary]] of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] and [[President of Romania|President]] of the [[State Council of Romania|State Council]] of [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]], strongly condemning the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]]. On the night of 20–21 August 1968, five [[Warsaw Pact]] nations - the [[Soviet Union]], [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]], [[East Germany]], and [[People's Republic of Poland|Poland]] - invaded [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] in an effort to quell the [[Socialism with a human face|reformist ideology]] of [[Alexander Dubček]], the First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia]].

On 21 August, in what became his most famous speech,&lt;ref&gt;Conflicted Memories: Europeanizing Contemporary Histories, edited by Konrad H. Jarausch, Thomas Lindenberger, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Ceaușescu boldly denounced the invasion in a public address before 100,000 people in [[Revolution Square, Bucharest|Palace Square]] in [[Bucharest]], and declared that it was a "grave error and constituted a serious danger to peace in Europe and for the prospects of world socialism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://adevarul.ro/cultura/istorie/apoteoza-ceausescu-21-august-1968-1_50dc9b51596d72009141826b/index.html Apoteoza lui Ceaușescu – 21 august 1968]&lt;/ref&gt; His address was perceived as a bold gesture of disobedience to the Soviet Union both at home and abroad. The speech was part of the post-1956 efforts of the communist elite in Bucharest to emancipate their Party from [[Moscow]].

Ceaușescu's response consolidated Romania's independent voice in the next two decades, especially after Ceaușescu encouraged the population to take up arms in order to meet any similar maneuver in the country: he received an enthusiastic initial response, with many people, who were by no means communist, willing to enroll in the newly formed paramilitary [[Patriotic Guards (Romania)|Patriotic Guards]].

The events are exhibitions and reviews of contemporary [[fine art]], [[poetry]] readings, and conference presentations of books including poetry, essays, and novels. A lecture series offers debate and discussion on literary themes, contemporary history, art criticism and art history.

These activities are predominantly organized in Scandicci, Florence and in other Tuscan towns, but have been held in other Italian regions as well as internationally.

'''''Desilets v. Clearview Regional Board of Education''''', 137 N.J. 585 (1994),&lt;ref name=Desilets&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Desilets v. Clearview Regional Board of Education |vol=137 |reporter=N.J. |opinion=585 |pinpoint= |court= |date=1994 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/supreme-court/1994/a-133-93-opn.html |accessdate=2018-02-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] decision that held that public school curricular student newspapers that have not been established as forums for student expression are subject to a lower level of First Amendment protection than independent student expression or newspapers established (by policy or practice) as forums for student expression.

== Background ==
The [[Clearview Regional High School District]] had an extracurricular club that produced the ''Pioneer Press'' student newspaper. Brien Desilents, a student member of the club, submitted movie reviews  for ''[[Mississippi Burning]]'' and ''[[Rain Man]]'' but the school principal blocked them from being printed, not because the reviews themselves were problematic, but because the underlying movies were [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]]. The student's mother then filed suit in state court claiming violations of both the federal and state constitution. The New Jersey Supreme Court did find that the school paper was not a public forum. However, because they held that the school did not have a consistent policy related to "pedagogical concerns" they felt that in this circumstance censorship was not warranted. The Student Press Law Center explains it best. "in Desilets v. Clearview Regional Board of Education the New Jersey Supreme Court rejected school officials’ justifications
for censoring reviews of R-rated
movies from a student newspaper under the Hazelwood standard as “equivocal and inconsistent.”34 The court noted that there was nothing offensive in the reviews, that R-rated movies were discussed in class by teachers, that such reviews were available in the school
library and that the student newspaper had,
in fact, reviewed such movies in the past." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.getsnworks.com/spl/pdf/HazelwoodGuide.pdf|title = Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier A complete guide to the Supreme Court decision|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Student Press Law Center|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also another source states, " HELD: The judgment of the Appellate Division is affirmed, substantially for the reasons expressed in the majority opinion below. The Court also determines that the school, as a non-public forum, failed to prove that it had established a policy related to legitimate pedagogical concerns."&lt;ref name=Desilets/&gt;

==Basis==
The First Amendment Freedom of Speech clause was not violated by the school district because the First Amendment protection for student expression described in ''[[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District|volume=393|page=503|pin=|year=1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt; does not compel a public school to affirmatively sponsor speech that conflicts with its educational goals. The school-funded newspaper at issue was also not considered to be a public forum under the totality of circumstances present in the case, and therefore, its editors were entitled to a lower level of First Amendment protection than is applicable to independent student newspapers or those newspapers that have, by policy or practice, opened their pages to student opinion.  "The trial court ruled that the school principal's decision to delete the pupil's movie reviews from the school newspaper did not violate his expressional rights under the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution because such action was reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns, as required by the United States Supreme Court in ''[[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier]]''."&lt;ref&gt;''Desilets'', 137 N.J. at 588, citing {{ussc|name=Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|volume=484|page=260|pin=|year=1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the trial court determined that the student's rights had been violated under the State Constitution, which, it found, provided broader protection of free expression than the First Amendment.&lt;ref name=Desilets/&gt;

==Precedent==
Under the First Amendment, school officials can censor curricular, non-forum student newspapers when they can justify their decision with a legitimate pedagogical (i.e., educational) justification. Subsequent decisions, such as the decision in ''[[Dean v. Utica Community Schools]]'', 345 F.Supp.2d 799 (E.D. Mich. 2004), have made clear that this is not carte blanche for school officials to censor articles wantonly or based on personal opinion.

Note also that some states have passed laws guaranteeing that curricular, non-forum newspapers (those at issue in ''[[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier|Hazelwood]]'') have greater rights than the First Amendment requires.

[[File:Turn-of-the-tide.jpg|thumb|right|1869 programme featuring Hodson]]

'''Henrietta Hodson''' (26 March 1841 – 30 October 1910) was an English actress and theatre manager best known for her portrayal of comedy roles in the [[Victorian era]].  She had a long affair with the journalist-turned-politician [[Henry Labouchère]], later marrying him.

==Biography==
Hodson was born at Upper Marsh in St Mary's parish, [[Westminster]], London. She was the eldest daughter of George Alfred Hodson (1822–1869), an Irish-born comedian, singer and innkeeper, and Henrietta Elizabeth Noel, an actress and singer. Her two sisters, Kate (later Mrs Charles Henry Fenton, but known on stage as Kate Gordon) and Sylvia (Mrs J. Stripling Blythe), were also actresses. Hodson's cousin was the theatre producer [[George Musgrove]].&lt;ref&gt;Gittins, Jean. [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks15/1500721h/0-dict-biogMu-My.html#musgrove1 "Musgrove, George (1854–1916)"], Australian Dictionary of Biography, 1974, accessed 26 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early career ===
Hodson made her first professional stage appearance at the Theatre Royal, [[Glasgow]], in 1858. In 1860, she and [[Henry Irving]] worked together in [[Manchester]] in ''The Spy, or, A Government Appointment''.  She joined J. H. Chute's Bath and Bristol companies in 1861 and built a reputation as a popular soubrette and [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] actress.  An 1883 ''[[New York Times]]'' article calls her "the cleverest [[Aladdin]] in [[H. J. Byron]]'s piece I remember to have seen."&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1883/01/17/106245396.pdf "London Facts and Gossips"], ''The New York Times'', 17 January 1883&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, at the Theatre Royal in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, she played the role of [[Oberon]] in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' under the management of [[Madge Kendal|Madge Robertson]] (later Mrs Kendal), who also starred in the play, and [[Ellen Terry]].  There she also played the title role in the burlesque ''Endymion''.  In 1864, she married Richard Walter Pigeon, a solicitor and widower from [[Bristol]], England, who had several children, and left the stage.  They had one child, George Walter Noel Pigeon, born in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k104/samesizedfeet/Picture2-1.png Baptisim record from International Genealogical Index v. 5.0, British Isles], FamilySearch&lt;/ref&gt; Hodson left her husband, amid rumours of abuse, and returned to acting, using her maiden name.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://i86.photobucket.com/albums/k104/samesizedfeet/freemandsDecember191871.png Information from the ''Freeman's Journal and Daily Commercial Advertiser'' (Dublin, Ireland, December 19, 1871, p. 4, col. 5) about an 1870 lawsuit in which Hodson's husband attempted to wrest control from her of the Royalty Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1866, Hodson made her London début at the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] under the management of [[Marie Wilton]] (later Lady Bancroft) and H. J. Byron, as Prometheus in Byron's Christmas show, ''Pandora's Box, or, The Young Spark and the Old Flame''.&lt;ref name=Pascoe&gt;Pascoe, Charles E. (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=jm0BAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA181 "Hodson, Henrietta."], ''Our actors and actresses. The dramatic list'' (1880), pp. 180–81, David Bogue, London, accessed 25 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1867, with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]], Irving, [[J. L. Toole]], [[Lionel Brough]] and Terry, Hodson joined a new company at [[Queen's Theatre, Long Acre]], and opened with [[Charles Reade]]'s ''The Double Marriage'', in which Hodson played the small role of Jacintha.  About 1868, she moved in with [[Henry Labouchère]],&lt;ref name=Genealogy&gt;[http://www.labouchere.co.uk/linkpages/labbyanddora.htm "Labby and Dora"]. labouchere.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; a member of parliament and later a journalist and playwright, who was one of the founders of Queen's Theatre, but they could not marry until years later when her first husband died.&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt; Other roles that season included Arabella Fotheringay in ''The First Night'', Lucy in Byron's ''Dearer than Life'' and in the same author's ''The Lancashire Lass'', and the title role in ''Oliver Twist''.  In addition to roles in other Byron pieces, she acted at Queen's in various [[extravaganza]]s and burlesques, including ''[[La Vivandière (Gilbert)|La Vivandière]]'' by [[W. S. Gilbert]], ''The Stranger'' by [[Robert Reece]], ''The Gnome King'' by William Brough, the successful ''The Turn of the Tide'' by [[F. C. Burnand]], and ''Twixt Axe and Crown'' by [[Tom Taylor]].  She stayed with that company for three years.&lt;ref name=Pascoe/&gt;

=== Later years ===
In 1870, she managed the [[Royalty Theatre]] for a season, playing in many of its pieces.  She starred in Reece's ''Whittington Junior and his Sensation Cat'' and other burlesques.  Back at Queen's Theatre, she played [[Ariel (Shakespeare)|Ariel]] in ''[[The Tempest]]'' and Imogen in ''[[Cymbeline]]''.  In 1871 she began to manage the Royalty again, starring there in ''The Honeymoon'' as Juliana.  She instituted the innovation of using a hidden orchestra below the stage.  Also in 1871, she played Lady Amaranth in [[John O'Keeffe (Irish writer)|John O'Keefe's]] ''Wild Oats'', followed by such roles as Nydia the blind girl in [[John Oxenford]]'s version of [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Lord Lytton's]] ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1872), Dick Wastrell in ''Old London'', adapted from ''Les Chevaliers du Brouillard'' (1873; a French dramatisation of ''[[Jack Sheppard]]''), and Jane Theobald in Gilbert's ''Ought We to Visit Her?'' (1874).&lt;ref name=Pascoe/&gt; During that play, she quarrelled with Gilbert, threatened him with legal action when he described the quarrel to others, and demanded a written apology, which she then made public.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 104–05&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875 in [[Liverpool]], Hodson created the title character of Clytie in [[Joseph Hatton]]'s dramatisation of his novel of the same name.  That year she also created the lead role of Eliza Smith in [[Arthur Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Zoo]]'' in London.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/gas/zoo/html/zoo_home.html G&amp;S Archive page on ''The Zoo'']&lt;/ref&gt; She repeated the role at the [[Olympic Theatre]] in 1876.  In 1877, she became the leading actress with the [[Haymarket Theatre]], then managed by [[John Baldwin Buckstone]].  There she played Cynisca in a revival of Gilbert's ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]''.  Gilbert did not wish to cast her, but under her contract with the Haymarket, she insisted on taking the role and again threatened legal action.&lt;ref name=Ainger125&gt;Ainger, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; The next Gilbert piece at the theatre was a revival of ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'', and Hodson insisted on playing a different role than the one Gilbert and Buckstone wished.&lt;ref name=Ainger125/&gt; Buckstone gave the actress notice that she would not be needed the next season.  Hodson blamed Gilbert and consulted her solicitor.  When he told her that she had no case, she instead complained of Gilbert's "persecution" of her and criticised his demanding directing methods in a pamphlet-letter circulated among theatre professionals.  Gilbert responded quickly with an open letter, setting forth a series of letters and references that showed inaccuracies in Hodson's statements.  This was published on 27 May 1877 in ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', along with Hodson's rebuttal.  In the end, she did not appear in ''The Palace of Truth''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 126–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html Vorder Bruegge, Andrew "W. S. Gilbert: Antiquarian Authenticity and Artistic Autocracy"]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPic5kyJ?url=http://faculty.winthrop.edu/vorderbruegg/winthropweb/vitaindex/gilbert.html |date=3 May 2011 }}, Retrieved on 12 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, Hodson returned to Queen's Theatre as Dolores, Countess Rysoor, in Labouchère's ''Fatherland'', an adaptation of [[Victorien Sardou]]'s ''Patrie!''.  She retired from acting soon afterwards and lived in comfort at [[Alexander Pope]]'s Villa at Cross Deep [[Twickenham]], near London, with Labouchère.  However, in 1881, she tutored and mentored [[Lillie Langtry]] in her early stage work, accompanying Langtry to America the next year, although the two soon fell out, and Hodson returned to England.

In 1887, she finally married Labouchère, with whom she already had a daughter, Mary Dorothea (1884–1944).  In 1903 Hodson and her husband moved to Villa Christina, near [[Florence, Italy]].  She died there at the age of 69.  Her daughter, Mary Dorothea, married Carlo Emanuele Starabba, 2nd Marchese di Rudinì (the son of [[Antonio Starabba, Marchese di Rudinì]], prime minister of Italy) in 1903, then the Prince Gyalma Odescalchi De Szerem, and finally Don Eugenio [[Ruspoli]].&lt;ref&gt;Princess Eugene Ruspoli Obituary, ''[[The Times]]'', 4 December 1944; p. 6, col. G&lt;/ref&gt; Hodson and Labouchère are buried at the cemetery of San Miniato al Monte, Florence.&lt;ref name=Genealogy/&gt;

[[File:L'Ermatena.jpg|thumb|An [[engraving]] of Hermathena published in ''L'Ermatena'' by [[Michele Arditi]] (1816)]]
'''Hermathena''' or '''Hermathene''' ({{lang-grc|Ἑρμαθήνη}}) was a composite statue, or rather a [[herma|herm]], which may have been a [[Term (architecture)|terminal bust]] or a [[Janus]]-like bust, representing the Greek gods [[Hermes]] and [[Athena]], or their Roman counterparts [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Minerva]].

==Symbolism==
It was natural to see these two deities unified or fused as one form: the Greek god Hermes presided over [[eloquence]], the goddess Athena over crafts and the sciences. The reverse of a medal of the [[Hadrian|Roman Emperor Hadrian]], who prided himself on his learning and eloquence, depicts Hermathena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Bell|title=Bell's New Pantheon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nypdAAAAMAAJ|year=1790|page=394}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early Greek poetry and myth, Hermes and Athena share or 'double' each other's functions, and some of their powers are alternate and related versions of the same quality. For example, each god embodies the kind of clever intelligence or ''[[wiktionary:metis#Etymology 2|metis]]'' that manifests itself in the clever ruse and the winning strategy. For Hermes this quality leans toward the 'night-time' realm of stealth and theft, cunning deception, and successful guidance to the underworld; while for Athena it leans toward the 'day-time' realm of good judgement, quick thinking, and successful guidance on the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Russo|date=2000|title=Athena and Hermes in Early Greek Poetry: Doubling and Complementarity|url=http://www.yale.edu/classics/downloads/parry/Athena_and_Hermes.pdf|page=596}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hermes and Athena were also described as half-siblings because [[Zeus]] was the father of both gods.

==Literature==
The only literary sources concerning Hermathena are found in letters by [[Cicero]] to [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]]. Atticus had obtained a rare herm of Athena from Athens for Cicero's Tusculanum ([[Tusculum]] [[Roman villa|villa]]) in 67–65 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/hermathena-hermeracles-e509980?s.num=1&amp;s.start=120|title=Hermathena, Hermeracles|publisher=[[Brill's New Pauly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jérôme Carcopino|title=Cicero|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PlUVAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Hermathena#v=snippet&amp;q=Hermathena&amp;f=false|volume=1|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=1969|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cicero writes to Atticus: ''"Your Hermathena pleases me greatly. It stands so prettily that the whole lecture-room looks like a votive chapel of the deity. I am greatly obliged to you".''&lt;ref name="Cicero"&gt;[[Cicero]]. ''[[Writings_of_Marcus_Tullius_Cicero#Letters|Letters to Atticus]]'' 1, 1, 5; 1, 4, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

He returns to the subject in another letter. Atticus had probably purchased for him another sculpture of the same kind.

''"What you write about the  Hermathena pleases me greatly. It is a most appropriate ornament for my own little 'seat of learning.' Hermes is suitable every where, and Minerva is the special emblem of a lecture-room. I should be glad if you would, as you suggest, find as many more ornaments of the same kind for the place".''&lt;ref name="Cicero"/&gt;

It was common during the [[Roman period]] for the elite to collect herms and terminal figures as [[Roman gardens|garden ornaments]] and interior decorations for their villas and palaces. Having a statue of Hermathena may have also been believed to give [[artistic inspiration|divine inspiration]].

One of the few surviving Hermathenas is on display at the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]. A bust of Athena from the 1st century BC (circa 49–25 BC), that had once topped a terminal pillar, was found at the [[Villa of the Papyri]] at [[Herculaneum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cir.campania.beniculturali.it/museoarcheologiconazionale/itinerari-tematici/nel-museo/collezioni-pompeiane/RIT_RA411|title=Erma di Atena (6322)|publisher=Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Napoli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Renaissance]], a number of artists, for example [[Rubens]] and [[Vincenzo Cartari]], portrayed Hermathena in art either as two gods acting in conjunction, or as a single deity with the attributes of the other, for example Athene holding the [[caduceus]], which was a symbol of Hermes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Gordon|title=The Renaissance Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0520040929|year=1980|pages=47–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the ceiling at the [[Farnese Palace]] is a late-16th-century fresco of Hermathena, called the ''Gabinetto dell'Ermatena'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Graziella Frezza|title=The Palazzo Farnese at Caprarola|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=8880164481|year=2001|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Federico Zuccari]]; the fresco depicts an androgynous fusion of the deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-lune.com/v6/index?domain=labinf&amp;nodes=website&amp;author=Giulia%20Spina&amp;title=Palazzo%20Farnese%20di%20Caprarola|title=Il Palazzo Farnese di Caprarola}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hudson, New York, Sesquicentennial half dollar''', sometimes called the '''Hudson Sesquicentennial  half dollar''', is a [[Early United States commemorative coins|commemorative]] [[Half dollar (United States coin)|fifty-cent piece]] struck by the [[United States Mint|United States Bureau of the Mint]] in 1935. The coin was designed by [[Chester Beach]]. Its [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] depicts the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', flagship of [[Henry Hudson]], after whom the city of [[Hudson, New York|Hudson]] is named. In addition to showing the ship, the coin displays a version of the Hudson city seal, with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] riding a whale, a design that has drawn commentary over the years.

Although the city of Hudson was a relatively small municipality, legislation to issue a coin in honor of its 150th anniversary went through Congress without opposition and was signed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], becoming the Act of May 2, 1935. In June 1935, 10,000 Hudson half dollars were distributed to civic authorities for sale to the public.

Most of the coins were likely bought by coin dealers, leaving few for collectors, with the result that prices spiked from the $1 cost at the time of issue. This caused anger among coin collectors, but did not lower the coin's value, which has continued to increase in the 80-plus years since it was struck.

== Background and legislation ==

[[Hudson, New York]], the seat of [[Columbia County, New York|Columbia County]], lies on the east bank of the [[Hudson River]], south of [[Albany, New York|Albany]]. It was founded in 1662 under the name Claverack Landing.{{sfn|Slabaugh|p=103}} Originally a trading post for the [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaer family]], it saw considerable expansion in the early 1780s, and was incorporated under the name Hudson in 1785. During the 1930s, it had about 14,000 residents.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=293–294}}

In 1935, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at face value and vend them to the public at a premium.{{sfn|Slabaugh|pp=3–5}} In the case of the Hudson half dollar, the responsible official or group was to be designated by the Mayor of Hudson.{{sfn|Flynn|p=352}}

A bill for a half dollar to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the incorporation of Hudson was introduced in the House of Representatives by New York Congressman [[Philip A. Goodwin]] on April 6, 1935, and provided for 6,000 pieces. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures.&lt;ref name = "history"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://congressional.proquest.com/legisinsight?id=PL74-48&amp;type=LEG_HIST|title=Hudson, New York and Providence Rhode Island Anniversary Commemorative 50-Cent Pieces)|publisher=ProQuest Congressional|accessdate=August 8, 2017|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goodwin was the longtime president of the [[Greene County, New York|Greene County]] Historical Society, and introduced the bill as a favor for friends in nearby Hudson.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=102}} A report was issued by Missouri's [[John J. Cochran]], acting chairman of the committee, on April 2, 1935, recommending that the bill pass with an amendment increasing the mintage to 10,000, and noting that Goodwin had appeared before the committee to pledge that the entire quantity struck would be taken up by the city authorities, and thus there would be no coins left on the Mint's hands.{{sfn|House report|pp=1–2}} On April 3, immediately after the House passed a bill for the [[Old Spanish Trail half dollar]], it passed the bill for the Hudson piece on Cochran's motion, without debate or opposition. The Missouri congressman also included his report in the ''[[Congressional Record]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1935|4951–4952|date=April 3, 1935}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill thus passed to the Senate, where it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. On April 11, 1935, New York Senator [[Robert F. Wagner]] issued a report, recommending that the bill pass unamended.{{sfn|Senate report|p=1–2}} When the bill was considered in the Senate on April 15, Rhode Island's [[Jesse H. Metcalf]] moved to amend it so that the bill would also provide for the issuance of a [[Rhode Island Tercentenary half dollar]]. There was no objection or debate concerning either the amendment or the bill as a whole, and it passed the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1935|5643–5644|date=April 15, 1935}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the two chambers of Congress had passed different versions of the bill, it returned to the House of Representatives. There, on April 18, on motion of Cochran, the House agreed to the Senate amendments,&lt;ref&gt;{{USCongRec|1935|5995|date=April 18, 1935}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was enacted on May 2 by the signature of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].{{sfn|Swiatek|p=249}} Anthony Swiatek and [[Walter Breen]], in their 1988 volume on commemoratives, suggested that the bill passed because of "probably the usual 'you vote for my bill and I'll vote for yours' arrangement".{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|pp=101–102}}

== Preparation ==

On the day Roosevelt signed the legislation, Congressman Goodwin wrote to [[Charles Moore (city planner)|Charles Moore]], chairman of the [[Commission of Fine Arts]], requesting the names of suitable artists to design the coin. The commission was charged by a 1921 [[executive order]] by President [[Warren G. Harding]] with rendering advisory opinions regarding public artworks, including coins.  Moore suggested [[Laura Gardin Fraser]] as standing in the first rank of medallists, with other possibilities to include Mint Chief Engraver [[John R. Sinnock]], [[Paul Manship]], [[Francis H. Packer]] and [[Chester Beach]]. Mayor Frank Wise of Hudson asked if [[John Flanagan (sculptor)|John Flanagan]], who had recently designed the [[Washington quarter]], would do; Moore agreed by telegram. However, the commission went to Beach for $1,000; the sculptor also agreed to guide the city through the coin approval process.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=v–vi, 161}}

Wise and his officials had tentatively decided to have a head of [[Henry Hudson]] on one side of the coin, with the city seal on the other.  Beach quickly prepared sketches and met with Wise on May 13, but convinced the mayor that instead of the explorer (no actual portrait of him is known) his ship, the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', would be a better choice. Working at speed unusual for a commemorative coin of that era, Beach completed plaster models in one week, adding a crescent moon to the left of the ship. The models were converted to coinage dies by the [[Medallic Art Company]] of New York, who could accomplish the task faster than the [[Philadelphia Mint]]. Though records are not complete, the company apparently contacted the Mint for advice; Chief Engraver Sinnock sent it a letter on May 23. While unfamiliar with the Hudson legislation, Sinnock had confidence in Beach's ability because his previous designs were easy for the Mint to strike into coins. Beach quoted this praise in reporting to Moore on May 27 that [[Lee Lawrie]], the sculptor-member of the Commission of Fine Arts, had approved the designs. Approval by the full commission followed on May 28, and by Secretary of the Treasury [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] a week later.{{sfn|Taxay|pp=161–166}}

== Design ==

The [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the coin shows the ''[[Halve Maen|Half Moon]]'', Henry Hudson's flagship, sailing to the right. To the left of the [[Cargo ship|merchantman]]'s rigging is a stylized crescent moon. The ship is surrounded with two rings of lettering, the inner reading "[[In God We Trust|{{small|IN GOD WE TRUST}}]]" and {{small|HUDSON}}, and the outer the name of the country and the coin's denomination. The designer's monogram, {{small|CB}}, may be found at the waterline on the left side of the coin. The reverse is a rendition of the city of Hudson's seal, with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] holding a trident, riding backward on a whale. A mermaid or [[Triton (mythology)|triton]] in the background blows into a conch shell.{{sfn|Swiatek|pp=249–250}} The seal design reflects Hudson's heritage as a whaling port, although it is some distance up the [[Hudson River]] from the ocean.{{sfn|Taxay|p=166}} The motto {{small|ED DECUS ET PRETIUM RECTI}} (''Both the honor and the reward of the righteous'') is copied from the city seal; the name of the city and the anniversary dates surround the seal, with [[E pluribus unum|{{small|E PLURIBUS UNUM}}]] above the dates.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=250}}

[[Don Taxay]], in his book on commemorative coins, described the seal as "a rather whimsical composition";{{sfn|Taxay|p=161}} Beach had deemed it "rather amusing" and had hoped the new coins "will be a little more interesting than the others I have done".{{sfn|Taxay|p=165}} Swiatek and Breen referenced "the quaint device of King Neptune riding backwards on a spouting whale, whose eye is represented as being about where its blowhole should be. Neptune is briefly clad in a wisp of cloth 'blowing in the wind'."{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=101}} They suggested that the position of the moon meant, if it was waxing, that the ship was sailing west toward America, but if waning, was sailing east to Europe.{{sfn|Swiatek &amp; Breen|p=101}}

Art historian [[Cornelius Vermeule]], in his volume about U.S. coins and medals, considered the ship on the obverse "straightforward fare for commemorative half-dollars", though he found the name "{{small|HUDSON}}"  beneath the waves unneeded given the legend on the reverse.{{sfn|Vermeule|p=189}} The reverse based on the city seal was to him "a harming throwback to colonial days, and in American numismatics to the quasi–federal and state issues of the period 1780 to 1792".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=189}} Vermeule noted "the baroque motto above Neptune and his group [that] makes it evident that this subject, appealing and amusing in itself, appears here because it is the singular characteristic of the City of Hudson on the river of the same name".{{sfn|Vermeule|p=190}}

== Production, distribution, and collecting ==
{{quote box | align = right | width = 30em | salign = right
| quote =  So far as known, this piece is the first ever dedicated to the coin collector. Everything about it shows the purpose for which it was issued. Behold, on the obverse, the ship of Hudson homeward bound in all its triumph. Is it not laden, oh, my friends, with the catch of a most profitable expedition to the Sea of Suckers, where the proverbial one is born every minute? &amp;nbsp;... But, ah! the reverse — can it really be the devil himself? Be still, my troubled heart, 'tis only the captain of the great ''Half Moon'' jauntily sporting his workaday clothes! Caught, too, in the very act of administering the coup-de-grace to the poor sucker that was snared into his trap. Another unsuspecting sucker may be seen nearby awaiting his turn and blowing his trumpet in anticipation of what he believes to be his great moment. 
| source = "A. Shornlamb", ''[[The Numismatist]]'', February 1936, p. 109.{{sfn|Bowers|p=297}}}}

On June 12, 1935, John Evans, vice president of the First National Bank of Hudson, wrote to [[Mary M. O'Reilly]], the acting Director of the Mint, asking on behalf of Mayor Wise that only 6,000 coins be struck at that time, with the remainder to be coined later if demand justified it.{{sfn|Flynn|pp=282–283}} But the Mint delivered the entire authorization of 10,000 on June 28. Reservations for coins had been taken since early May (at $1 per coin, plus postage of $.03 per two coins and [[registered mail]] fee of $.18 per order), and on July 2, Evans, who was in charge of distribution, began informing what Swiatek called "[i]nfuriated collectors" that the coins were sold out.{{sfn|Swiatek|p=250}} Coin dealer Julius Gruttag, of New York City's Gruttag Brothers, is believed to have bought 7,500 coins at $.95 each, with Hubert W. Carcaba, of Saint Augustine, Florida, believed to have bought 1,000.{{sfn|Bowers|p=295}} In addition to the 10,000 pieces distributed, eight coins were struck at Philadelphia and retained there to be available for inspection and testing at the 1936 meeting of the annual [[Assay Commission]].{{sfn|Swiatek|p=249}}

The uproar in the coin-collecting community resulted in bad publicity for the city of Hudson. Although the specifics of how the coins came to be so quickly sold out were not immediately known, collectors intuited a trick, especially when coins proved plentiful on the market at between $5 and $7 each. Many of these sold, helping set off a commemorative coin boom that would continue later in 1935 when low-mintage varieties of the [[Daniel Boone Bicentennial half dollar]] came on the market after a similar immediate sellout. But collectors wrote angry letters to numismatic societies and periodicals, and the Hudson piece was among those that future [[American Numismatic Association]] president L. W. Hoffecker complained about to Congress when he testified in March 1936. By 1940, the price on the secondary market had dropped back to $5.50, but thereafter rose steadily and reached $1,700 during the commemorative coin boom of 1980.{{sfn|Bowers|pp=295–299}} The 2017 edition of [[R. S. Yeoman]]'s ''[[A Guide Book of United States Coins]]'' lists the coin for between $700 and $1,500, depending on condition.{{sfn|Yeoman 2017|p=305}} A near-pristine specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $15,275.{{sfn|Yeoman 2015|p=1147}}

[[Image:Santa Maria del Naranco.jpg|right|thumbnail|140px|Church of Santa María del Naranco. Eastern façade. This is probably the finest example of Asturian architecture.]]

The '''[[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture]]''' of the '''[[Iberian Peninsula]]''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''arte prerrománico''; in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], ''arte pré-românica'') refers to the art of Spain and Portugal after the [[Classical Antiquity|Classical Age]] and before [[Romanesque art]] and [[Romanesque architecture|architecture]]; hence the term ''Pre''-Romanesque.

[[Visigothic art and architecture|Visigothic art]], the art of the [[Visigoths]] to 711, is usually classified as [[Migration Period art]] by art historians to emphasis its Germanic connections and origins; but can also classified as Pre-Romanesque, particularly in Spain, to emphasis its lineage in Spanish history.

==Styles==
The main styles (based on chronological and geographic considerations) of the Iberian Pre-Romanesque were:

*[[Visigothic art]]
*[[Asturian art]], the art of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]] from 718 through the 10th century
*[[Mozarabic art]], art of mixed Arab-Spanish heritage made by the [[Mozarabs]], the Christians under the Islamic rule.
*[[Repoblación art and architecture]] (Spanish, ''arte de [[repoblación]]''), art on the increasing Christian frontierlands. Most of the formerly called Mozarabic buildings receive nowadays also this denomination.

In [[Catalonia]] and [[Aragon]], a style ancestral to the Romanesque developed early in parallel with the region of [[Lombardy]] and it has become common to refer the formerly called late Catalan Pre-Romanesque as "[[first Romanesque]]" after the suggestions of [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]].

The '''Kasta Tomb''', also known as the '''Amphipolis Tomb''' ({{lang-el|Τάφος της Αμφίπολης}}), is an [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient Macedonian]] [[tomb]] that was discovered inside the Kasta mound (or [[tumulus]]) near [[Amphipolis]], [[Central Macedonia]], in northern [[Greece]] in 2012 and first entered in August 2014.&lt;ref name="telegraph 1" /&gt; The first excavations at the mound in 1964 led to exposure of the perimeter wall, and further excavations in the 1970s uncovered many other ancient remains.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Amphipolis", Ministry of Culture: {{ISBN|960-214-126-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recently discovered tomb is dated to the last quarter of the 4th century B.C. The tumulus is the largest ever discovered in Greece and by comparison dwarfs that supposedly of [[Philip II of Macedon]], father of [[Alexander the Great]], in [[Vergina]].&lt;ref name="telegraph 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dw 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dw.de/greeces-largest-ancient-tomb-amphipolis/g-17909472 |title=Greece's largest ancient tomb: Amphipolis |author=Kate Müser |date=9 September 2014 |website=www.dw.de |publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]] |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation team, based on findings unearthed at the site, argued that the tomb was a memorial dedicated to the close friend of [[Alexander the Great]], [[Hephaestion]].&lt;ref name="usnews.com"&gt;https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2015/09/30/excavator-ancient-grave-in-greece-honored-alexanders-pal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greece.greekreporter.com"&gt;http://greece.greekreporter.com/2015/09/30/hephaestions-monogram-found-at-amphipolis-tomb/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identity==
It is not yet known who is buried in the tomb. Initial public speculation that it could be the [[tomb of Alexander the Great]], due to its size and the estimated cost of construction, was dismissed by experts when commenting on the published findings, as the available historical records mention [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]] as the final resting place of [[Tomb of Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's body]]; it has been suggested instead that the occupant could either be a wealthy [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]] noble or a late member of [[Argead dynasty|the Macedonian royal family]].&lt;ref name="telegraph 1" /&gt;

In November 2014, the skeletal remains of five people were unearthed inside a corresponding tomb located in the lower levels of the third chamber. The bodies interred within are those of a woman aged older than 60, two men aged between 35–45, a newborn infant, and a fifth person consisting of only a few cremated bone fragments.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Πέντε οι σκελετοί στην Αμφίπολη: 3 άντρες, 1 γυναίκα και 1 νεογέννητο |trans-title=Five skeletons in Amphipolis: 3 men, 1 woman and 1 newborn |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.gr/2015/01/19/culture-nees-apokalipseis-gia-tin-amphipoli-_n_6495220.html |language=Greek |date=19 January 2015 |accessdate=25 September 2017 |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further examination is underway with regard to dating the bodies, while a DNA cross examination is being conducted in order to compare them with those buried in neighboring tombs in the area.

During a press conference at the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]], lead archaeologist Katerina Peristeri and head architect Michalis Lefantzis revealed the existence of three inscriptions which apparently link the tomb to [[Hephaestion]], a Macedonian nobleman, general and close friend of [[Alexander the Great]]. The ancient Greek word "ΠΑΡΕΛΑΒΟΝ" (meaning "received") is written in the inscriptions, and next to it the monogram of [[Hephaestion]].&lt;ref name="usnews.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="greece.greekreporter.com"/&gt;

==Discovery==

[[File:Kasta tumulus and Lion of Amphipolis location map en.jpg|thumb|Kasta tumulus and Amphipolis location map]]

In the 1970s a building of {{cvt|10|m}} width was found on top of the centre of the mound, and is thought to have been a grave marker. This, together with other evidence, supported the likelihood of a large funerary complex within. The tumulus was also found to have covered earlier cemeteries with at least 70 graves from the nearby "Hill 133" settlement predating Amphipolis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Finds==
Archaeologists have made a number of important discoveries on the site since August 2014. Apart from the sheer size of the monument, which experts say bears the handprint of [[Dinocrates of Rhodes]], the chief architect of [[Alexander the Great]],&lt;ref name="dw 1" /&gt; archaeologists have so far unearthed: 
*Two [[marble]] [[sphinx]]es approximately {{convert|2|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall that guard the main entrance to the tomb&lt;ref name="minculture 1" /&gt; (one head and wing fragments later found in third chamber).
*A [[fresco]], paint still visible, that mimics an [[Ionian order|Ionian]] [[peristyle]], on top of which the sphinxes sit.&lt;ref name="minculture 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yppo.gr/2/g22.jsp?obj_id=58074 |title=Συνέχιση ανασκαφικών εργασιών στον Τύμβο Καστά στην Αμφίπολη |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=21 August 2014 |website=www.yppo.gr |publisher=[[Ministry of Culture and Sport (Greece)|Ministry of Culture and Sport]] |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="minculture 3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yppo.gr/2/g22.jsp?obj_id=58112 |title=Συνέχιση ανασκαφικών εργασιών στην Αμφίπολη |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=24 August 2014 |website=www.yppo.gr |publisher=[[Ministry of Culture and Sport (Greece)|Ministry of Culture and Sport]] |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Two female statues of the [[Caryatid]] type in the [[antechamber]], which support the entrance to the second compartment of the tomb.&lt;ref name="minculture 4"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yppo.gr/2/g22.jsp?obj_id=58312 |title=Συνέχιση ανασκαφικών εργασιών στον Τύμβο Καστά στην Αμφίπολη |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=7 September 2014 |website=www.yppo.gr |publisher=[[Ministry of Culture and Sport (Greece)|Ministry of Culture and Sport]] |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The height of each Caryatid is {{convert|2.27|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="minculture 5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yppo.gr/2/g22.jsp?obj_id=58512 |title=Συνέχιση ανασκαφικών εργασιών στον Τύμβο Καστά στην Αμφίπολη|date=21 September 2014 |website=www.yppo.gr |publisher=[[Ministry of Culture and Sport (Greece)|Ministry of Culture and Sport]] |accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caryatids are on a pedestal {{convert|1.40|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, making the total height of the statues {{convert|3.67|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="minculture 6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yppo.gr/2/g22.jsp?obj_id=58633 |title=Συνέχιση ανασκαφικών εργασιών στον Τύμβο Καστά στην Αμφίπολη|date=21 September 2014 |website=www.yppo.gr |publisher=[[Ministry of Culture and Sport (Greece)|Ministry of Culture and Sport]] |accessdate=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A marble door, typical of Macedonian tomb doors, broken into pieces in front of the doorway to the third chamber.&lt;ref name="minculture 7"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yppo.gr/2/g22.jsp?obj_id=58672 |title=Συνέχιση ανασκαφικών εργασιών στον Τύμβο Καστά στην Αμφίπολη |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2 October 2014 |website=www.yppo.gr |publisher=[[Ministry of Culture and Sport (Greece)|Ministry of Culture and Sport]] |accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A mosaic—{{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|4.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long—in the second chamber, which seems to depict [[Persephone]] abducted by the god [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] ({{lang-gr|Πλούτων}}, ''{{transl|el|Ploutōn}}''), ruler of the underworld, wearing a laurel wreath and driving a chariot drawn by horses led by the god [[Hermes]], the [[psychopomp|conductor of souls]] to the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29589427|title=Greece archaeologists uncover Amphipolis floor mosaic|date=12 October 2014|website=www.bbc.com|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=641774|title=Amphipolis tomb: Archeologists reveal figure of Persephone in mosaic – The discovery also suggests that the bearded man is the god Pluto, ruler of the underworld|date=16 October 2014|website=www.tovima.gr|publisher=TO BHMA|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction of the abduction of Persephone in the mosaic floor implies links with the cluster of royal tombs in [[Vergina]] (Aigai), as a mural representing the same scene decorates one of the tombs where King Philip II, Alexander the Great's father, is buried.&lt;ref&gt;http://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/amphipolis-mosaic-portrays-abduction-of.html#.Vayr_M6ARBw&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Burials==
The skeletal remains of 5 individuals were found:
* a woman over 60 years of age
* two adult men, an elder and younger, between 35 and 45 years of age
* a newborn infant
* fragments of a cremated adult

The younger male showed signs of unhealed, possibly fatal wounds. Analysis of the skeletal remains is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;Hellenic Republic, Ministry of Culture and Sports, January 19, 2015 Press Release (in Greek)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precautions==
In response to the magnitude of the finds, the authorities of [[Central Macedonia]] have requested and were granted a heavy 24-hour police guard of the dig site, and have also begun procedures to have the Kasta Tomb included in [[UNESCO]]'s list of [[World Heritage Site]]s as a "top priority".&lt;ref name="euronews 1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gr.euronews.com/2014/09/03/amphipolis-candidacy-for-unesco-s-list-of-world-heritage-sites-/ |title=Αμφίπολη: Προς ένταξη στα μνημεία της UNESCO – Εντυπωσιακό βίντεο από ελικόπτερο |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=3 September 2014 |website=www.euronews.com |publisher=[[Euronews]] |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opening of Kasta Tomb to the public==

In November 2017, the Greek Minister of Culture, Lydia Koniordou, announced that the grave should be accessible to the public in about three years. The financing for the necessary construction project should amount to around €2.8 million. €1.5 million is to be spent by the Region of Central Macedonia, €1.3 million is to be taken from the INTERREG Fund of the European Union. In the course of this measure, building materials of the grave site, which were later used by the Romans elsewhere, will be rebuilt in their original location. The work should begin in 2018 or 2019 and last for around one year.&lt;ref&gt;''Griechenland Zeitung'', Edition 605, November 29. 2017, page 7 (German language)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The book investigates a series of murders of wealthy [[Osage people]] that took place in [[Osage County, Oklahoma]] in the early 1920s—after big oil deposits were discovered beneath their land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Killers Of The Flower Moon The Osage Murders And The Birth Of The FBI by DAVID GRANN|url=https://www.npr.org/books/titles/523348082/killers-of-the-flower-moon-the-osage-murders-and-the-birth-of-the-fbi|website=NPR|publisher=[[npr.org]]|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Killers of the Flower Moon THE OSAGE MURDERS AND THE BIRTH OF THE FBI By DAVID GRANN|url=https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/208562/killers-of-the-flower-moon-by-david-grann/9780385534246/|publisher=penguinrandomhouse.com|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officially, the count of the murdered full-blood wealthy Osage native Americans reaches at least 20, but Grann suspects that hundreds more may have been killed because of their ties to oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whaley|first1=Monte|title="Killers of the Flower Moon": Murdering the Osage for ill-gotten gains|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/07/13/killers-of-the-flower-moon-the-osage-murders-and-the-birth-of-the-fbi-book-review/|website=[[The Denver Post]]|publisher=denverpost.com|accessdate=6 October 2017|date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book reports cattleman [[William Hale (cattleman)|William Hale]] as the mastermind standing behind the murders and presents detailed evidence.

==Reception==
Sean Woods of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote: "In his masterful new book Killers of the Flower Moon: the Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI, which comes out this week, Grann chronicles a tale of murder, betrayal, heroism and a nation's struggle to leave its frontier culture behind and enter the modern world... Filled with almost mythic characters from our past – stoic Texas Rangers, corrupt robber barons, private detectives, and murderous desperadoes like the Al Spencer gang – Grann's story amounts to a secret history of the American frontier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woods|first1=Sean|title='Killers of the Flower Moon': Inside David Grann's New True-Crime Epic|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/killers-of-the-flower-moon-inside-new-true-crime-epic-w476689|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=rollingstone.com|date=April 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer of ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' stated "New Yorker staff writer Grann (The Lost City of Z) burnishes his reputation as a brilliant storyteller in this gripping true-crime narrative, which revisits a baffling and frightening—and relatively unknown—spree of murders occurring mostly in Oklahoma during the 1920s."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI|url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-385-53424-6|website=[[Publishers Weekly]]|publisher=publishersweekly.com|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ed Vulliamy of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said "The genocide by white America against Native nations during the century leading up to Grann’s period is a metaphor for humanity’s decimation of the natural world which the Natives saw as sacred. Grann’s book is a timely and disturbing chapter in the original, terrible atrocity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vulliamy|first1=Ed|title=Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/may/01/killers-of-the-flower-moon-david-grann-review|website=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=6 October 2017|date=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15504">LED [[wallpaper]] is an expression encompassing a range of different technologies developed since the beginning of the 21st century, aimed at integrating [[light-emitting diodes]] into flat substrates suitable to be applied to walls for [[interior decoration]] purposes.
The experimentation on the combination of light sources and wall covering surfaces has been largely fostered by the progressive miniaturisation of low-voltage lighting technology, such as [[LEDs]] and [[OLEDs]], suitable to be incorporated into low-thickness materials to be applied onto interior walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schubert |first=E. Fred |date=2003 |title=Light-emitting Diodes |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521823307}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The new possibilities offered by these developments have prompted some designers and companies to research and develop proprietary LED wallpaper technologies, some of which are currently available for commercial purchase. Other solutions mainly exist as prototypes or are in the process of being further refined.
The first model of LED wallpaper is attested in the book ''Wallpaper'' by Lachlan Blackley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackely |first=Lachlan |date=2006 |title=Wallpaper |location=London |publisher=Laurence King Ltd |page=187 |isbn=1-85669-502-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; dating 2006 in the work of textile designer Maria Yaschuk, who designed a flexible solution to incorporate LEDs into digitally printed wall covering material as part of her graduation project for the MA degree in Textile Futures at [[Central Saint Martins]] college of art and design [[London]] back in 2004.&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Central Saint Martins Post-graduate Directory 2005/6 |location= London |publisher=University of the Arts London |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackley's book is also the first known published attestation of the term ''LED wallpaper'' used in relation to LED-incorporated wall coverings. This definition is currently used by companies such as [[Meystyle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meystyle.com/about/about.html |title=Winner of Maison &amp; Objet Projects award 2014 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Meystyle.com |publisher=Meystyle |access-date=31 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329164250/http://meystyle.com/about/about.html |archivedate=29 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and designer [[Ingo Maurer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ingo-maurer.com/en/products/led-wallpaper |title=LED Wallpaper |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Ingo-maurer.com |publisher=Ingo Maurer |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in relation to LED wall covering solutions included in their current catalogues. Other attested expressions to indicate similar concepts are Light-emitting wallpaper used by Lomox&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lomox.co.uk/articles/technology |title=LOMOX OLED Innovation |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Lomox.co.uk |publisher=Lomox |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and luminous textile used by [[Philips]].&lt;ref name="Philips"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newscenter.philips.com/main/standard/news/press/2011/20110704_luminous_textile.wpd#.Vvunp3qwV_o |title=Philips Announces Partnership with Kvadrat Soft Cells to Bring Spaces Alive with luminous textile |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2011 |website=Philips.com |publisher=Philips |access-date=31 March 2016 |df= }}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LED wallpaper by Meystyle==
[[Meystyle]] claim to have been the first company to pioneer the technology to fully integrate light-emitting diodes into the material of the wallpaper so that it can be hanged like a traditional wall covering. Maria Yaschuk, co-founder of the company together with sister Ekaterina Yaschuk, presented the first prototype of LED wallpaper as part of her graduation project for the MA degree in Textile Futures at CSM already in 2004.&lt;ref name="CSM" /&gt; The concept was successively developed with her sister Ekaterina into a series of designs exhibited in 2007 under the name Wire Geometrics at the National Glass Centre in Sunderland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Brownlee |first=S. |date=2008 |title=Paper Chase |magazine=Spaces |location=Chester |publisher=Jazz Publishing |issue=20 |pages=114–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalglasscentre.com/about/whatson/details/?id=279&amp;to=2008-03-24%20&amp;from=2007-12-01 |title=Maria Yaschuk: Wire Geometrics |publisher=National Glass Centre |access-date=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year Maria and Ekaterina went on to commercialise their product under the company name Meystyle LED Wallpaper &amp; Fabric.&lt;ref name="eyesin"&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Wallpaper design by Maria &amp; Ekaterina Yaschuk |magazine=Eyes in |publisher=Eyes in America Corp. |date=2011 |issue=3 |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Meystyle uses digital printing to transfer their designs on a variety of non-woven substrates suitable for wall covering. The LEDs are then incorporated by hand with a special technique that avoids adding any thickness to the material. Meystyle claim their LED wallpaper can be hanged like any standard wall covering with the additional requirement of a power socket or a light switch.&lt;ref name="eyesin" /&gt;

==Living Wall by High-Low Tech==
Living Wall is a project developed by [[MIT Media Lab]] research group High-Low Tech in 2009 as an experiment on interactive wallpaper that can be programmed to monitor its environment, control lighting and sound, and generally serve as an unobtrusive way to enrich environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inhabitat.com/living-wallpaper-by-high-low-tech-monitors-your-environment/ |title="Living" Wallpaper by High-Low Tech Monitors Your Environment |last1=Malik Chua |first1=Jasmine |date=2010 |website=Inhabitat.com |publisher=Inhabitat |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wallpaper is flat, made entirely from paper and paint and is paired with a computing kit whose pieces can be customized with all manner of sensors, LED lamps, network interfaces, and interactive embellishments. The designers claim the pieces can be controlled by running the hand across the surface of the wallpaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://highlowtech.org/?p=27 |title=Living Wall |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Highlowtech.org |publisher=High-Low Tech |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Living Wall project was displayed at the [[Fuller Craft Museum]] in [[Brockton, Massachusetts]] from June to September 2010 as part of the exhibition New Materiality: Digital Dialogues at the Boundaries of Contemporary Craft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/en_uk/blog/mit-media-labs-interactive-living-wall |title=MIT Media Lab's Interactive Living Wall |last1=Kaganskiy |first1=Julia |date=2010 |website=Vice.com |publisher=Vice |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2010 the [[Carbon Trust]] awarded a £454,000 grant to Welsh company LOMOX to develop a light emitting wallpaper using an ultra-efficient organic LED ([[OLED]]) technology that can be used as an even natural-looking light source for interior spaces in place of the more energy-demanding traditional lighting systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.go-green.ae/greenstory_view.php?storyid=1038 |title=LOMOX - Eco-friendly light emitting wallpaper |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Go-gree.ae |publisher=Go Green |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digsdigs.com/cool-light-emitting-wallpaper-from-lomox |title=Cool Light Emitting Wallpaper from Lomox |date=2010 |website=DigsDigs.com |publisher=DigsDigs |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new technology was due for commercial release in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/light-emitting-wallpaper |title=Light-Emitting Wallpaper |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2010 |website=TheEngineer.co.uk |publisher=The Engineer |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LED wallpaper by Ingo Maurer and Team==
Together with [[Meystyle]]'s, [[Ingo Maurer]]'s LED wallpaper is the only one currently available for commercial purchase. The LED wallpaper was designed by Ingo Maurer in partnership with Architects Paper in 2011 and is produced and distributed by Architects Paper.&lt;ref name="AS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.as-creation.com/uploads/media/Architects_Paper_LuminousWalls_en.pdf |title=LED Wallpaper - Ingo Maurer by Architects Paper |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=ASCreation.com |publisher=AS Creation |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maurer's wallpaper presents itself as a large electronic circuit board printed on paper and can be affixed to the wall with normal wallpaper adhesive. The conducting paths printed on the matte non-woven substrate become part of the design, on top of which are distributed white, red and blue LEDs. The red and blue diodes form optical cuboids with the white lights loosely and irregularly spread around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inhabitat.com/ingo-maurer-unveils-innovative-geometric-led-wallpaper |title=Ingo Maurer Unveils Innovative Geometric LED Wallpaper |last1=Lisa |first1=Ana |date=2012 |website=Inhabitat.com |publisher=Inhabitat |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LEDs are controlled by a series of connection units which enables the individual regulation of the colours and the degrees of brightness of the LEDs. Silver-coloured skirting boards join the wallpaper to the floor and hide the technical equipment behind them.&lt;ref name="AS" /&gt;

==Luminous wallpaper by Philips==
In 2011 [[Philips]] announced a partnership with Kvadrat Soft Cells to create a luminous textile which would combine Philips' experience in LED-based ambient lighting with Kvadrat Soft Cells' sound-absorbing textiles.&lt;ref name="Philips" /&gt; The aim of the project is to enhance interior space through light and texture making full use of the broad spectrum of colours in Philips’ LED range. The textile is held in place with a lightweight [[aluminum]] frame that keeps it taut with the right amount of surface tension. The LED lights can be customised in a wide palette of colours that allow the final user to change the mood of the room whenever desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inhabitat.com/luminous-led-wallpaper-lends-a-low-energy-glow-to-any-room/ |title=Luminous LED Wallpaper Lends a Low-Energy Glow to Any Room |last1=Zimmer |first1=Lori |date=2011 |website=Inhabitat.com |publisher=Inhabitat |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative light-emitting wall covering solutions==
There are some other examples of wall covering developments aimed at incorporating light-emitting technologies onto the surface of the walls that do not necessarily make use of light-emitting diodes.

In 2007 [[Dutch people|Dutch]] designer Jonas Samson created a wall covering system with integrated lighting. The product appears to be regular wallpaper when the light is off and when illuminated can display light in any pattern or design. The design enables a room to be lit entirely by the walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.designboom.com/technology/light-emitting-wallpaper-by-jonas-samson |title=Light emitting wallpaper by jonas samson |last1=Archer |first1=Nate |date=2007 |website=Designboom.com |publisher=Designboom |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turning the wallpaper on can be performed as a single action or can be set up in an elaborate sequence to make a space more dynamic and engaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dornob.com/on-and-off-light-up-wallpaper-illuminates-interior-spaces/?ref=search |title=Light-Up Wallpaper Illuminates Interior Spaces |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Dornob.com |publisher=Dornob Design Ideas Daily |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designer has used phosphorescent pigments, transparent layers and a light switch to create a patterned wall with a botanical print powered by external light sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avso.org/interior-design-ideas/as-if-from-beyond-the-grave-here-emitting-light-wallpaper-by-jonas-samson |date=2015 |title=As if from beyond the grave here: emitting light wallpaper by Jonas Samson |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Avso.org |publisher=AVSO |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 [[Swedish people|Swedish]] designer Camilla Diedrich created a line of luminescent wallpaper that is lit by [[fiber optics]]. The line is called Nature Ray Charles Wallpaper and consists of an assortment of floral motifs in eight colour variations. The floral patterns are made with the fiber optic itself and produce a soft energy-efficient ambient light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inhabitat.com/fiber-optic-wallpaper-by-camilla-diedrich |title=Luminescent Fiber Optic Wallpaper by Camilla Diedrich |last1=Flahiff |first1=Daniel |date=2008 |website=Inhabitat.com |publisher=Inhabitat |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 [[Brooklyn]]-based design company Flat Vernacular launched a line of wallpaper that can glow in the dark. Each glowing paper is printed using glow in the dark ink. The inks get charged by typical room lighting or sunlight and release a soft glow when the lights are turned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brit.co/our-newest-interior-design-crush-glow-in-the-dark-wallpaper-by-flat-vernacular |title=Our Newest Interior Design Crush? Glow in the Dark Wallpaper by Flat Vernacular |last1=Temple |first1=Anjelika |date=2012 |website=Brit.co |publisher=BRIT+CO |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, designer Debra Courtenay launched a project on the invention platform [[Quirky]] called ''Wallbrights''. The concept combines the idea of LED wallpaper and customisable [[wall decal]] and consists of a series of individual hexagonal shapes containing an [[RGB]] LED light with an adhesive backing that can be easily attached to the wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trendhunter.com/trends/quirky-wallbrights |title=Wallbrights Provide Customizable Illumination and Decoration |last1=Roblin |first1=Amelia |date=2012 |website=Trendhunter.com |publisher=Trend Hunter |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LED hexagonal decals can be composed into different patterns and shapes. Each component needs to be continuously connected to an adjacent one through their male/female connectors. The whole configuration can then be powered through a wall socket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.homecrux.com/2012/09/27/1217/wallbrights-smartphone-controlled-wall-decal-to-spruce-up-your-room.html |date=2015 |title=Wallbrights: Smartphone-controlled wall decal to spruce up your room |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Homecrux.com |publisher=Homecrux |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brightness and the colour of the lighting scheme can be adjusted through a [[mobile app]] that communicates with the units via [[Bluetooth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/light-up-your-walls-with-led-decals-177978 |date=2015 |title=ED Decals: The Future of Wall Decor? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=apartmenttherapy.com |publisher=Apartment Therapy |access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="45337">{{more citations needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;!-- If not a direct adaptation, the connection with source work(s) is original research/editor POV without citations. --&gt;
Sometimes, an author will write a story that is consciously based on an older story (typically in the [[public domain]]) but with a modernized [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] and [[fictional character|characters]]. Sometimes the original work is still [[copyrighted]], but the writer includes the minimum quota of differences to avoid being a direct [[plagiarism]] while using [[Copyright Law of the United States#Parodies|an immediately recognizable story template]].

==Film==
&lt;!--
This list only includes films that are an adaptation of an OLDER work (typically public domain, pre-1923) with a significant change in time period. Only films that are (1) credited on-screen or (2) reliable sources state the film is an adaptation of (NOT just bearing a passing resemblance) an older work.

Listing format:
Name of film - (Name of author)'s (type of work) (year) (name of work) set in (brief description of location and time period)

Example: Apocalypse Now - Joseph Conrad's 1899 novella Heart of Darkness set in 1969 during the Vietnam War

Entries may be deleted if:
(1) Work is not modernized, i.e. set roughly around the same time period as the source material (2) Work is not cited by reliable sources as a direct adaptation, but more vaguely as "inspired by", "bears some resemblance to" (3) The source material is post-copyright era

'''Membrane structures''' are spatial structures made out of tensioned membranes. The structural use of membranes can be divided into [[pneumatic structure]]s, [[tensile membrane structure]]s, and cable domes. In these three kinds of structure, membranes work together with cables, columns and other construction members to find a form. Membranes are also used as non-structural cladding, as at the [[Beijing National Stadium]] where the spaces between the massive steel structural members are infilled with PTFE coated glass fiber fabric and ETFE foil. The other major building on the site, built for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], is the [[Beijing National Aquatics Center]], also known as the Water Cube. It is entirely clad in 100,000 square metres of inflated ETFE foil cushions arranged as an apparently random cellular structure.

==Materials==

The common membranes used in membrane structures include:
* [[PVC]] coated [[polyester]] fabric
* Translucent [[Polyethylene]] fabric
* PVC coated [[glass fiber]] fabric
* [[PTFE]] coated glass fiber fabric; foils like 
* [[ETFE]] foil
* PVC foil.

[[File:Felino Rampante Mochica.jpg|thumb|250px|The Moche Crawling Feline]]
The '''Moche Crawling Feline''' is a specific [[stirrup spout vessel]] dating from 100—800 CE. This [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] ceramic effigy is currently in the collection of [[Larco Museum]], in [[Lima, Peru]]. It comes from the North Coast of Peru. It represents a zoomorphic character: a lunar dog, or a crawling feline.

==Background==
In the Northern cultures of Peru, ceramic is the main support to pass on the religious concepts, and was used for the principal funerary, sacrificial and fertility rituals. This type of piece was found in the funerary context of a Moche ruler and was one of the most important ways to honour him and to accompany him in his journey to the underworld.

[[Pre-Columbian]] societies were agricultural societies, their knowledge was therefore principally based on the observation of the sky (of the stars, the rain, the climate changes …), of the earth (for the agriculture), and of the subterranean world (for the medicinal plants and roots). Their way of thinking the world was therefore organized according to those three levels of the world. As a matter of fact, they adored the animals that represented those three levels: the bird for the sky and the upper world, the world of the gods, the feline for the earth and the world of here, the human world, and the reptiles (that are snakes most of the time) for the subterranean world, the underworld, the world of death.

Pre-Columbian societies were the masters of ceramic; they reached an exceptional level of sculptural quality. This comes from a precise and patient observation of nature and of their environment and from the methodic study of animals and their morphology.

The perfection of their sculptural and pictorial techniques in their ceramics allowed them to increase the details in the representation of their religious subjects. The feline was one of the most important symbolic religious animals. It appears a lot in the Northern cultures and it became a major source of inspiration for Peruvian artists. 
It is a strong and brave animal, and it is linked to fertility and water, as it comes from the wet and fertile Amazonian grounds.

==Interpretation==
Ultimately the species of the animal portrayed in unknown. This piece could represent a mystical animal, half feline, and half bird, decorated with nacre incrustations. The eye of this mystical character is made of turquoise. If we look at the object to the right, we can see a feline; while if we look at it to the left, we can see a bird. The eye is the link between the two. This object corresponds to the concept of the creative duality, which is very important for pre-Columbian societies. The feline’s snout is disproportionate, and the animal is seated with his paws up, in a fighting position. The nacre triangles represent the crest of the bird, which is a symbol of importance and power. The crests are at the same time a symbol for the union between the upper world and the underworld. This is very important because it explains one of the major concepts of Ancient Peru: the fact that the upper world (the world of the Earth) receives the water and the light coming from the sky, creating life.

This piece has various names: the dragon, the lunar dog, the lunar monster, or the crawling feline. We can see, for example, that the animal’s ears are not typical of those of a feline but are more those of a fox, an animal that connects the different worlds together. This piece is the expression of complementarity, of two worlds that are meeting, uniting their power. 
It intrigues and attracts the curiosity of the tourists of the Larco Museum because of its mysterious aspect and the obvious spirituality it carries.

== History ==
Early Native American culture was rich with ceremonies, rituals and storytelling. These ceremonies had theatrical elements, but whether or not these traditions are early forms of modern-day theatre or are independent cultural practices is not clear. According to Henry Schafer, “A variety of rituals and ceremonies could be considered early forms of theatre….Others see this interpretation as a devaluation of sacred rituals as simply a pre-form of secular theatre.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"&gt;{{cite book | last=Däwes | first=Birgit | title=Indigenous North American drama : a multivocal history | publisher=SUNY Press | publication-place=Albany | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-4384-4660-8 | language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first practitioners of Native Theatre was a [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; poet named [[E. Pauline Johnson|Emily Pauline Johnson]], who performed dramatic readings of her poems in the late nineteenth century. Other early contributors to the Native Canadian Theatre scene included a non-native named Anthony Walsh who directed the “Can-Oos-Sez Skay-loo Drama Group,” from 1934 to 1942, and Emily General (Cayuga), who established a series of annual plays to be performed at the Great Pine Forest Theatre on the Six Nations Reserve in 1949.&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; In 1950, two non-Natives, Frank Morrison and Cecil West wrote and directed the opera ''Tzinquaw: The Thunderbird and the Killer Whale'', which premiered in Duncan, BC, performed by purely Native people. In Canada, playwrights James Reaney, John Herbert, and George Ryga made their contribution to Native theatre with ''The Ecstasy of Rita Joe'' (1970). Margo Kane (Saulteaux/Cree/Blackfoot) joined the production of ''The Ecstasy of Rita Joe'' in 1978 and became the first Native American actor to play the part of Rita Joe in 1981.

According to Henry Schafer, 1985-1995 was the “Golden Age” of Native Theatre.&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; Many Native Theatre companies and playwrights emerged during this period. Tomson Highway (Cree) joined the Native Earth Performing Arts (NEPA), starting as a musical director and performer.  In 1985, Ondinnok Mythological Theatre was founded in Montreal by French-speaking Native playwright Yves Sioui Durand. Other Native Theatre companies that emerged during this period were: Tunooniq Theater, Awasikan Theatre, Urban Shaman and Native Youth Theatre R-Street Vision. In 1987, on the Hobbema Reserve, Four Winds Theatre Group was founded by Darrel and Lori Wildcat (Cree), along with cofounders Rosa and Melvin John. After the Four Winds Theatre Group closed in 1991, the Johns went on to form Kehewin Native Performance Resource Network (KNPRN). “KNPRN concentrates on traditional theatre, storytelling, and dance and works with young people, touring all over Canada and internationally.” (1) In 1992, Margo Kane founded Full Circle: First Nations Performance in British Columbia. Two of the most recent Native Theatre companies to emerge are Saskatchewan Native Theatre Company (1999) and Red Sky Performance in Toronto (2000). From 1995 to present day Native Theatre has struggled to maintain its size and popularity. One major issue the Native Theatre scene faced was lack of funding. Although some of the theatre companies closed and some still struggle to survive, the Native Theatre scene is continuing to develop and mature. “Even though Native theatre is a relatively recent phenomenon in Canada, it is by now an integral part of the Canadian cultural landscape. It takes on many forms and draws from various traditions like storytelling, European theatre, traditional dance, and multimedia. It resists any clear-cut definition and is constantly exploring new forms of expression.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt;

The stories that inspire Native American Theatre have been around for hundreds of years, but did not gain formal recognition by colonial America.&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; This lack of recognition lasted until the 1930s when [[Lynn Riggs]], a playwright of [[Cherokee]] descent, brought Native Theatre into the spotlight through the Six Nations Reserve Forest Theatre in Ontario. Through these events, Native Theatre has been introduced to mainstream society and contemporary Native American Theater was born. Canadian playwright Drew Hayden Taylor explains how Native American theatre has been around for centuries, but has only recently been highlighted in North American mainstream media: “Native Theatre is much older than the scant few years. It is as old as this country, as old as the people who have been here for thousands of years, as old as the stories that are still told today. It is merely the presentation that has changed.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt;

Since the creation of contemporary Native American Theater, there have been plays available for publishing: “There are currently over 250 published and far over 600 unpublished plays by some 250 Native American and [[First Nations]] playwrights and theatre groups on the North American market.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; These numbers do not include the plays inside the ''North American Indian Drama'' collection as of 2006. Even though there is a large amount of plays available for production or analysis, the Native American drama genre is often overlooked by not only the general public, but also by universities. Shari Huhndorf states “drama remains the most overlooked genre in Native American literature.”&lt;ref name="Däwes 2013"/&gt; There needs to be more research and appreciation for Native American drama and its background. The lack of connection between plays from reservations and urban areas needs to improve in order for there to be more information from different angles and perspectives presented through dramatic literature. This can provide increased appreciation for Native American Theatre.

Contemporary Native American theater began in the 20th century and developed from oral culture and literature. These stories were used to “educate, entertain, and preserve” the new generations of the Native Americans. “However, indigenous theater was absent in Native writing during this period and the multiple reasons given for this nonexistence usually reflect a long history of silencing, discrimination, oppression, and displacement exercised in the genre.”&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SIDONÍ LÓPEZ and HANANE BENALI|first=|date=2016|title=NATIVE AMERICAN THEATER: A CONCISE HISTORY|url=|journal=miscelánea: a journal of english and american studies|volume=54|pages=93–111|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stories were usually told orally in a way accompanied by dancing, music, and other performances while the storyteller gets close to the audience to give them an immersive encounter of the story and the storyteller. These stories were usually exaggerated to give more drama for the audience. “This existence of this vibrant oral literature contrasts with the traditional Western conception that Native American cultures did not have history.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A non-Western historical record gave the misconception of Native Americans having no history before the arrival of European immigrants. Many Native American traditions and customs were suppressed due to colonization which prevented many from being able to tell their stories while they were oppressed. “The rise of the [[African-American civil rights movement (1954–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] during the 1960s and the 1970s also contributed to this reawakening of Native cultures since it appeared as a movement in which minorities demanded an end to discrimination and the right to speak for themselves.”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This gave pride and encouraged many to seek inspiration from history and ancestral roots. Today there are many theater productions performing Native American works.

== Characteristics ==
According to Rolland Meinholtz, who is an “instructor and artistic director of drama and dance at the Institute of American Indian Arts,” youth must understand the struggles of Native American culture through contemporary plays.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenous North American Drama|last=Meinholtz|first=Rolland|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=77–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; “They needed to know it, understand it, deal with it, struggle with it, hopefully integrate it, and lastly, build upon it.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In order to produce a play to convey a Native American themed message, you need dance, verse, drums, masks, facial painting. Even when the play consisted of non-Native Americans, Native American drama is all about the story and presentation, not about those who play the roles. “Nevertheless, there could be absolutely no question whose theatre we were witnessing. The spare setting, the drumming, the chanting and singing, the dancing, its episodic nature, and its wry point of view all proudly proclaimed this was Indian Theatre.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Coyote is a metaphor to describe the character of Native American theater. Native American Theater production that does not fit into western conventions cannot easily be categorized as comedy or tragedy. Thus, the coyote trickster represents the shape shifting nature of Native Theater itself. “For Indian theatre, there is no clear division of comedy and tragedy as found, for example, in ancient Greek drama. Comedy and tragedy are one: one extreme transforming into the other. Everything humans perceive as fixed is actually transitory and subject to transformation.” According to Meinholtz Japanese Noh drama is a guide to achieving the spiritual goals he intended for Native American drama. Meinholtz is inspired by ancient Native American architecture to create contemporary theater spaces. “The Great Kivas were not the only examples of theatrical structures among Native Americans. The Zuni people build specifically designed rooms onto their houses in which to house the annual Shalako Ceremony.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Challenging Stereotypes ==
[[Geraldine Keams]] (Navajo Nation TV and film actress) disrupts Native American stereotypes in her work. Keams has challenges stereotypes through writing and creating plays that include Native American history, such as ''Flight of The Army Worm'', first performed in 1976 at [[Navajo Community College]]. ''Flight of the Army Worm'' is one of the first contemporary published plays that was done by a Native American Woman. Through ''Flight of The Army'' ''Worm'' Keams was able to educate others about the Navajo Nation. “The character of the announcer gives the audience factual information about historical events, while through song, the Guitar Player urges revolution. This combination of modes of presentation aims to sharpen spectator’s analysis of the historical events they see and hear about. Keams combines Western and Indigenous pedagogies by moving the story from the intellectual account by the announcer to the personal account of Grandmother.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Drama by Contemporary Native American Women|last=Sullivan|first=Sharon|publisher=ProQuest|year=2004|isbn=|location=Ann Arbor|pages=34–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Native Theater Movement was built from several theaters, like the American Indian theatre Ensemble, Thunderbird Theater, and [[Spiderwoman Theater]].&lt;ref name="Haugo pp. 334–351"&gt;{{cite book | last=Haugo | first=Ann | title=A Companion to Twentieth-Century American Drama | chapter=Native American Drama | publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd | publication-place=Oxford, UK | date=November 21, 2007 | isbn=978-0-470-99680-5 | doi=10.1002/9780470996805.ch21 | pages=334–351}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theater companies helped consolidate a nationwide Native Theatre movement across the United States and Canada. Native American drama had to fight against indifference and lack of knowledge on the part of some mainstream audiences. Native American playwrights write for a larger audiences who may not be aware that Native Americans are a significant demographic. This creates a double burden on the need to educate as well as to create drama. The “Three Miguel sisters" founded the Spiderwoman Theater (1975); their drama has raised the public profile of figures and themes of traditional Native American stories. As more anthologies of contemporary Native American drama are published, the variety and creativity of the contemporary scene has become more apparent. “Just the fact that you’re on the stage telling these stories is political, just the fact that you’re there…it is a public act claiming one's native identity is a political act.”&lt;ref name="Haugo pp. 334–351"/&gt; The Native American Theatre Ensemble (1973) presented Native Americans on their own terms to combat stereotypical Indian misrepresentations.

Native American playwrights challenge centuries of stereotypes to create realistic characters conceived from their own personal experiences. The American Indian Theater Ensemble resolved to not only to rectify the cultural image of the Native American, but also to produce a body of drama intended primarily for the Indian community. “The purpose of making the company pan-tribal was to deconstruct stereotypes.”&lt;ref name="Haugo pp. 334–351"/&gt; [[Hanay Geiogamah]] was active in the founding years of the American Indian Theatre Ensemble, which produced his one-act play ''Body Indian''. ''Body Indian'' is pan-tribal work that demonstrates the problems Native American playwrights face in creating realistic drama based on contemporary Native American life. While Native people have been performing on the stages of the American theatre since the nineteenth century, at the turn of the twenty-first century, only a handful of articles on Native Theatre have been published, and most appeared in magazines rather than academic journals. Scholars in Canada embraced First Nations theatre more quickly, with much of the scholarship during the 1990s appearing in Canadian journals and published by Canadian presses. Now, twenty years later, Native and non-Native scholars seek to redefine the place of Indigenous theatre within the history of "American" theatre or, more accurately, the theatre of the Americas.&lt;ref name="Haugo pp. 334–351"/&gt;

== Influence ==
Indigenous American cultures have been a major aspect of Chicano drama.&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"&gt;{{cite book | last=Wilmer | first=S. E. | title=Native American performance and representation | publisher=University of Arizona Press | publication-place=Tucson | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-8165-0240-0 | pages=155–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicano/playwrights have been inspired by [[Native American mythology]] and history through the use of symbolism and characters to represent Chicano/as, who are considered to be descendants of indigenous Mexico. Before the end of the Mexican War (1848), Mexico consisted of both Texas and California. The use of symbols in Chicano/a plays range from the use of characters being in the play on stage or “at other times the Indio is imagined through the use of Indigenous music, flutes, and drums.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt; These symbols provide information that is not easily seen and influence the action of the play and were influenced by the Chicano/an’s indigenous roots.

In the play Day of the Swallows, Estela Portillo Trambley uses an Indigenous male character to represent the protagonist’s Native American roots. The main character appears as the “noble savage” who represents the Indio in the play and Eduardo is paired with a contrasting character, Josefa, who is connected to her heritage and is traditionally feminine. Josefa’s connection to her heritage in this play “is through images that only she can see and feel.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt; This play uses these visions as symbols that are influenced by their indigenous heritage. “Eduardo symbolizes the best and the worst of humanity in Josefa’s world, for he is Nature personified as Man.” ''Mummified Deer'' was written in 1984 by Luis Valdez. His character Cajeme, a deer dancer named after a famous Yaqui who fought against the Mexican government, is portrayed through different elements in the play. “Cajeme represents her inner thoughts, her fears, her Yaqui blood and being.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt; These plays were written to reconnect Chicanos with their Native American roots.

Estela Portillo Trambley and Luis Valdez were the most well-known authors of the Indigenous Chicano drama. They were the early proponents of bringing indigenous roots into Chicano/a plays. Trambley stated in an interview, “I hope…[Chicanos] still relate to seasons and to plants and to colors and to the wind, and to the Indian in them, or the element that is closest to the Earth.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt; Trambley is “regarded by most Chicano/critics and scholars as the author who inspired and opened the doors for all the Chicana writers who followed her.” Both of these playwrights used their own style while writing their individual plays. Trambley focused more on writing in the style of realism, which was more general with no indication of specific indigenous people, while Valdez wrote and produced in more specifics communities as well as by using “a surreal vision of the Chicano’s distorted postmodern, internally colonized condition.” Trambley stated in an interview, “I hope…[Chicanos] still relate to seasons and to plants and to colors and to the wind, and to the Indian in them, or the element that is closest to the Earth.”&lt;ref name="Wilmer 2011"/&gt;

'''Nut art''' was an artistic consciousness movement centered in northern California that flourished primarily in the late 60s and early 70s.

The term "Nut art" was coined by artist [[Roy De Forest]] (in conversation with writer David Zack) to describe an approach to art making which embraced humor along with the phantasmagorical. According to De Forest, Nut artists sought to create fantasy worlds reflective of their own quirks and eccentricities. As such, Nut art placed a high degree of emphasis on evolving visions, of which specific artworks were produced as part of the ongoing process of self-definition, or in service to creating new personas and personal mythologies.&lt;ref name=Daniels&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L. Daniels ; with essays by Philip E.|title=Clayton Bailey's world of wonders|year=2011|publisher=Crocker Art Museum|location=Sacramento, CA|isbn=978-1-8840-3822-8|pages=8, 24|author2=Frank, Patrick }}&lt;/ref&gt;(Among these personas was that of Ralph "Doggy" Dinsmore, which was used by De Forest.)

As with [[Conceptual art]], the idea or underlying concept with Nut art was paramount. As a result, the creation of the Nut artist was not restricted by style or medium, allowing the movement to embrace emerging formats such as performance, text pieces, and appropriation, in addition to more traditional two and three dimensional mediums such as drawing, photography, and sculpture. Because of the emphasis on concept and satire, Nut art welcomed contributions from participants without formal artistic backgrounds as well as those with advanced technical skill and training. Nut art also reflected the importance of process over product, which had been a central tenet of the Action painters a generation previous.

Besides De Forest, other key practitioners of Nut art included [[Robert Arneson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fineberg|first=Jonathan|title=A troublesome subject : the art of Robert Arneson|year=2013|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-27383-2|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clayton Bailey]] (as well as Bailey's alter-ego Dr. Gladstone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Albright|first=Thomas|title=Art in the San Francisco Bay area, 1945-1980 : an illustrated history|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=0-520-05193-9|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Victor Cicansky (alter-ego Victor Ceramski), Robert Cumming, [[Lowell Darling]], Jack Ford, [[David Gilhooly]], Jerry Gooch, Linda Renner, [[Peter Saul]], Harold Schlotzhauer, Richard Shaw, Irv Tepper, Chris Unterseher, Peter VandenBerge, Franklin Williams, Maija Zack (alter-ego Maija Woof), and David Zack.&lt;ref name=DePaoli /&gt;

David Zack, who was also a poet and art critic, reviewed many of the group's exhibitions.&lt;ref name=Daniels /&gt; Zack also participated in the movement as an exhibiting artist.

The first major exhibition of Nut art took place in 1972 at the University Art Gallery of [[California State University, Hayward]].

{{Culture of Pakistan}}
[[File:Mohatta Palace Renovated.JPG|250px|right|thumb|The Mohatta Palace, Karachi]]

'''Pakistani architecture''' refers to the various structures built during different time periods in what is now [[Pakistan]]. With the beginning of the [[Indus civilization]] around the middle of the 3rd millennium BC,&lt;ref name="indus"&gt;Guisepi, R.A. [http://history-world.org/indus_valley.htm The Indus Valley And The Genesis Of South Asian Civilization]. Retrieved on February 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; for the first time in the area which encompasses today's Pakistan an advanced [[urban culture]] developed with large structural facilities, some of which survive to this day. This was followed by the [[Gandhara]] style of [[Buddhist architecture]] that borrowed elements from [[Architecture of ancient Greece|Ancient Greece]]. These remnants are visible in the Gandhara capital of [[Taxila]].&lt;ref&gt;Meister, M.W. (1997). Gandhara-Nagara Temples of the Salt Range and the Indus. ''Kala'', the Journal of Indian Art History Congress. Vol 4 (1997-98), pp. 45-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indus Valley civilization ==
{{main|Indus Valley Civilization}}
[[Archaeologist]]s excavated numerous ancient cities, among them [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]], [[Harrappa]] and [[Kot Diji]], which have a uniform, appropriate structure with broad roads as well as well thought out [[sanitary]] and drainage facilities. The majority of the discovered brick constructions are public buildings such as bath houses and workshops. [[Wood]] and [[loam]] served as construction materials. Large scale temples, such as those found in other ancient cities are missing. With the collapse of the [[Indus Valley civilization]] the architecture also suffered considerable damage.&lt;ref&gt;Meister, M.W. (1996). [http://130.91.80.97:591/PDFs/38-3/Temples.pdf Temples Along the Indus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060527134429/http://130.91.80.97:591/PDFs/38-3/Temples.pdf |date=2006-05-27 }}. ''Expedition'', the Magazine of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. Vol 38, Issue 3. pp. 41-54&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately little is known about this civilization, often called Harappan, partly because it disappeared about 1700 BC for reasons unknown and because its language remains undeciphered; its existence was revealed only in the midst of the 19th century (your text says the 1920s), and excavations have been limited.  Surviving evidence indicates a sophisticated civilization.  Cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro (the "City of the Dead") had populations of some 35,000, they were laid out according to grid system.  Inhabitants lived in windowless baked brick houses built around a central courtyard. These cities also had a citadel, where the public and religious buildings were located, large pools for ritual bathing, granaries for the storage of food, and a complex system of covered drains and sewers.  The latter rivaled the engineering skill of the Romans some 2,000 years later.

With the rise of [[Buddhism]] outstanding architectural monuments were again developed, which have lasted into the present.&lt;ref name="indus" /&gt; In addition, the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Greece|Greek]] influence led to the development of the [[Greco-Buddhism|Greco-Buddhist]] style, starting from the 1st century AD. The high point of this era was reached with the culmination of the [[Gandhara]] style. Important remnants of Buddhist construction are stupas and other buildings with clearly recognizable Greek statues and style elements like support columns which, beside ruins from other epochs, are found in the Gandhara capital [[Taxila]] in the extreme north of the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]]. A particularly beautiful example of Buddhist architecture is the ruins of the Buddhist monastery [[Takht Bhai|Takht-i-Bahi]]  in the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|northwest province]].

}}
The arrival of [[Islam]] in today's Pakistan - first in [[Sindh]] - during the 8th century AD meant a sudden end of Buddhist architecture. However, a smooth transition to predominantly pictureless [[Islamic architecture]] occurred. The way early mosques were built with decorations oriented them strongly to the Arab style. The earliest example of a mosque from the days of infancy of [[Islam]] in [[South Asia]] is the Mihrablose mosque of Banbhore, from the year 727, the first Muslim place of worship in South Asia. Under the Delhi Sultan the Persian-centralasiatic style ascended over Arab influences. Most important characteristic of this style is the [[Iwan]], walled on three sides, with one end entirely open. Further characteristics are wide prayer halls, round domes with mosaics and geometrical samples and the use of painted tiles. The most important of the few completely discovered buildings of Persian style is the [[Rukn-e-Alam|tomb of the Shah Rukn-i-Alam]] (built 1320 to 1324) in [[Multan]].

At the start of the 16th century, the Indo-Islamic architecture was at its zenith. During the [[Mughal era]] design elements of Islamic-Persian architecture were fused with and often produced playful forms of the Hindustani art. [[Lahore]], occasional residence of Mughal rulers, exhibits a multiplicity of important buildings from the empire, among them the [[Badshahi mosque]] (built 1673-1674), the [[Lahore Fort|fortress of Lahore]] (16th and 17th centuries) with the famous [[Alamgiri Gate]], the colourful [[Wazir Khan Mosque]],&lt;ref&gt;Simon Ross Valentine. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MdRth02Q6nAC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=wazir+khan+mosque+mughal+architecture&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwCWoVChMIpO7m7LGLxgIVxbLbCh0RyAAL#v=onepage&amp;q=wazir%20khan%20mosque%20mughal%20architecture&amp;f=false 'Islam and the Ahmadiyya Jama'at: History, Belief, Practice] Hurst Publishers, 2008 {{ISBN|1850659168}} p 63&lt;/ref&gt; (1634-1635) as well as numerous other mosques and mausoleums. Also the [[Shahjahan Mosque]] of [[Thatta]] in Sindh originates from the epoch of the Mughals. However, it exhibits partially different stylistic characteristics. Singularly, the innumerable tombs of the Chaukhandi are of eastern influence. Although constructed between 16th and 18th centuries, they do not possess any similarity to Mughal architecture. The stonemason works show rather typical Sindhi workmanship, probably from before Islamic times. The building activity of the Mughals came close to succumbing by the late 18th century. Afterwards hardly any special native architectural projects were undertaken.

==British Colonial Architecture==
[[File:Mohatta Palace Khi.jpg|thumb|The [[Mohatta Palace]] in Karachi is a fine example of a blend of Islamic and British architecture]]
In the British colonial age predominantly representative buildings of the [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture|Indo-Saracenic revival]] style developed, from a mixture of European and Indo-Islamic components. Amongst the more prominent works are [[Mohatta Palace]] and [[Frere Hall]] in [[Karachi]], [[Lahore Museum]], [[University of the Punjab]] and [[King Edward Medical University]] in [[Lahore]]

==Post - Independence Architecture==

After independence Pakistan strove to express its newly found national identity through architecture. This reflects itself particularly in modern structures like the [[Faisal Mosque]] in Islamabad. In addition, buildings of monumental importance such as the [[Minar-e-Pakistan]] in Lahore or the mausoleum established with white marble known as [[Mazar-e-Quaid]] for the founder of the state expressed the self-confidence of the nascent state. The [[National Monument, Islamabad|National Monument]] in Islamabad is one of the latest examples of integrating culture, independence and modern architecture.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8373">'''Photozincography''', sometimes referred to as '''heliozincography''' but essentially the same process, known commercially as '''zinco''', is the photographic process developed by Sir [[Henry James (Ordnance Survey)|Henry James]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (1803&amp;ndash;1877) in the mid-nineteenth century.

This method enabled the accurate reproduction of images, manuscript text and outline engravings, which proved invaluable when originally used to create maps during the [[Ordnance Survey]] of Great Britain during the 1850s, carried out by the government's Topographical Department, headed by Colonel Sir Henry James.&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of London, 1859&amp;ndash;1860; Vol IV, Session IV: Earl De Grey’s Address; pages 109&amp;ndash;210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basis==
The foundation of this method is the insolubility of [[Potassium dichromate|bichromate of potash]] upon exposure to light, allowing the printing of images on to [[zinc]] from [[photographic negative]]s.

==Method==
At this time, high-contrast negatives were made using the wet plate [[collodion]] method (a solution of [[nitrocellulose]] in ether or acetone on glass). Once the negative had been made, a sheet of thin [[tracing paper]] was coated in a mixture of saturated potassium bichromate solution and gum water, and dried. This was then placed under the photographic negative and exposed to light for 2–3 minutes. The bichromate/gum mixture remained soluble on the parts of the tracing paper that were shielded from light by the opaque areas of the negative, allowing it to be removed, leaving an insoluble ‘positive’ image. This bichromate positive was then placed on a sheet of zinc covered in lithographic ink, and put through a [[printing press]] three or four times. After removal of the paper, the zinc plate was washed in a tray of hot water (containing a small amount of gum), using a [[camel-hair brush]] to remove all the soluble bichromate combined with ink. What remained on the zinc plate was a perfect representation in ink of the original composition, by virtue of the ink binding to the insoluble potassium bichromate.

The main advantage and innovation of this process over lithography was the use of zinc plates rather than stone ones. Zinc plates were lighter and easier to transport, could produce more prints, and were far less brittle than the stone plates originally used.&lt;ref&gt;T. Owen &amp; E. Pilbeam, ''Ordnance Survey: Map Makers to Britain since 1791'', (Southampton: Ordnance Survey; London: H.M.S.O., 1992), p.58&lt;/ref&gt; The use of zinc plates was also the origin of the name ''photozincography,'' which Sir Henry James claims to have invented.

==History==
[[File:Domesday zinco Somerset Glastonbury.jpg|thumb|right|A page from the photozincographic edition of Domesday Book for ''[[Somerset|Somersetshire]]'' (published by the Ordnance Survey in 1862), showing entries for some of the landholdings of [[Glastonbury Abbey]]]]
Zinco or photozincography developed at the Ordnance Survey out of a need to reduce large-scale maps more effectively. The original method using a [[pantograph]], was overcomplicated, time consuming and, due to the number of moving parts, inaccurate. While there was some concern that photography would distort the image, Sir Henry set out to explore the possibility of using photography, setting up a photography department at the Ordnance Survey in 1855 and also securing funds to build the "glasshouse", a photography building with an all glass roof to allow as much natural light in as possible for photography.&lt;ref&gt;T. Owen &amp; E. Pilbeam, ''Ordnance Survey: Map Makers to Britain since 1791'' (Southampton: Ordnance Survey; London: H.M.S.O., 1992), pp. 57&amp;ndash;60&lt;/ref&gt; The development and discovery of photozincography or zinco came about four years later, being first mentioned in Sir Henry's report to [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in 1859.

While Sir Henry James claimed to have invented the process, a similar system of document copying had been developed in Australia. [[John Walter Osborne]] (1828–1902) developed a similar process and for the same reasons as Sir Henry, to avoid using the tracing system of the pantagraph.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Wakeman, ''Aspects of Victorian Lithography'' (Wymondham: Brewhouse press, 1970), pp. 46&amp;ndash;49&lt;/ref&gt; While developed at the same time Sir Henry’s process, however as Sir Henry explained to a representative of Mr. Osborne in the quote below, he publicized it first.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I therefore handed this gentleman a copy of my Report, and desired him to read the account given of our process at page 6 of that Report, and to examine the copy of the Deed bound up with it, and not to show me the description of Mr. Osborne's process if it was differed from ours. After reading it, he said at once it was the same process, and I then told him it was useless for him to attempt to take out a patent as my printed Report had everywhere been circulated&lt;ref&gt;Capt. A. de C. Scott: On Photozincography and other photographic processes employed at the ordnance survey office, Southampton. Cited in Wakeman, ''Aspect of Victorian Lithography,'' p. 46&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sir Henry, despite being the person who oversaw and set up the photography department, was not the actual inventor. The head of the photography department at Southampton, Captain A. de C. Scott, did much of the ground work and basic development on photozincography. Sir Henry did acknowledge the work of Scott in the development and use of the system in the introduction to the [[Photozincography of Domesday Book|photozincographied Domesday Book]].&lt;ref&gt;H. James, ''Domesday Book, or the Great Survey of England of  William the Conqueror… Fac-Simile of the part relating to Cornwall'', (Southampton: By HM Command, 1861), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this it was Sir Henry who gained most of the public attention through his pamphlet on photozincography. He was knighted in 1861 for services to science.&lt;ref&gt;James, Sir Henry (1803&amp;ndash;1877) surveyor, ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of photozincography at the Ordnance Survey was a great success, with Sir Henry claiming it saved over £2000 a year, from the invention of photo-zincography; the cost of producing a map of a rural district was reduced from 4 to 1 and maps of towns were reduced from 9 to 1.&lt;ref name="The Photographic News Vol 3 1860, p360"&gt;The Photographic News Vol 3, 82, 30 March 1860, p360&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also claimed that up to 2000 or 3000 impressions could be taken from a single plate. Despite this, the process was not perfect: it did not reproduce a full colour picture, and until 1875 boys were employed to colour in the maps produced by this method. The process, while better than the pantagraph, still required a large amount of labour to prepare the zinc plates for pressing. However, photozincography began to be used fairly rapidly in [[Europe]]. Sir Henry was even honoured by the Queen of [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Wakeman, ''Aspects of Victorian Lithography'', pp. 45, 49, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Though originally developed to reproduce maps, the process was eventually to be used on a whole series of manuscripts, to preserve them and make them more available to the public. This included a [[Photozincography of Domesday Book|reproduction of Domesday Book]] in 1861&amp;ndash;64 and several volumes of historical manuscripts.  Whilst the process of photo-zincography was invented mostly for use the Ordnance Survey, The Photographic News stated that the process could also be used in the Patent office and would save vast amounts of time and money.&lt;ref name="The Photographic News Vol 3 1860, p360"/&gt; The use of photozincography began to decline in the 1880s as better methods of reproductions were made available and in the 1900s the glasshouse was pulled down to make way for new printing presses.

The '''Pompeian Styles''' are four periods which are distinguished in [[Roman art#Painting|ancient Roman mural painting]].  They were originally delineated and described by the German archaeologist [[August Mau]], 1840–1909, from the excavation of wall paintings at [[Pompeii]], which is one of the largest group of surviving examples of Roman frescoes.

The wall painting styles have allowed art historians to delineate the various phases of interior decoration in the centuries leading up to the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in 79 AD, which both destroyed the city and preserved the paintings, and between stylistic shifts in [[Roman art]].  In the succession of styles, there is a reiteration of stylistic themes. The paintings also tell a great deal about the prosperity of the area and specific tastes during the times.

The main purpose of these frescoes was to reduce the claustrophobic interiors of Roman rooms, which were windowless and dark{{Cn|date=October 2018}}. The paintings, full of color and life, brightened up the interior and made the room feel more spacious.

== First style ==
[[Image:Herculaneum Wall 1.Style.jpg|thumb|right|Fresco in the First style, from [[Ercolano]]]]
The ''First style'', also referred to as ''structural'', ''incrustation'' or ''masonry style'', was most popular from 200 BC until 80 BC.  It is characterized by the [[trompe l'oeil|simulation]] of marble (marble veneering), with other simulated elements (e.g. suspended [[alabaster]] discs in vertical lines, 'wooden' beams in yellow and 'pillars' and 'cornices' in white), and the use of vivid color, both being a sign of wealth. This style was a replica of that found in the [[History of Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic]] palaces of the near east, where the walls were inset with real stones and marbles, and also reflects the spread of [[Hellenistic]] culture as Rome interacted and conquered other Greek and Hellenistic states in this period.  Mural reproductions of Greek paintings are also found. This style divided the wall into various, multi-colored patterns that took the place of extremely expensive cut stone. The First Style was also used with other styles for decorating the lower sections of walls that were not seen as much as the higher levels.

An example would be the [[wall painting]] in the [[Ercolano#Casa Sannitica|Samnite House]] in Herculaneum (late 2nd  century BC).

== Second style ==
[[Image:Pompejanischer Maler um 70 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Still life]] in the Second style. Fresco from the home of Julia Felix, [[Pompeii]]]]
The ''Second style'', ''architectural style'', or 'illusionism' dominated the 1st century BC, where walls were decorated with architectural features and [[trompe l'oeil]] (trick of the eye) compositions. Early on, elements of this style are reminiscent of the First Style, but this slowly starts to be substituted element by element. This technique consists of highlighting elements to pass them off as three-dimensional realities – columns for example, dividing the wall-space into zones – and was a method widely used by the Romans.

It is characterized by use of [[relative perspective]] (not precise [[linear perspective]] because this style involves mathematical concepts and scientific proportions like that of the Renaissance) to create trompe l'oeil in wall paintings. The picture plane was pushed farther back into the wall by painted architectonic features such as [[Ionic column]]s or stage platforms. These wall paintings counteracted the claustrophobic nature of the small, windowless rooms of Roman houses.

Images and landscapes began to be introduced to the first style around 90 BC, and gained ground from 70 BC onwards, along with illusionistic and architectonic motives. Decoration had to give the greatest possible impression of depth. Imitations of images appeared, at first in the higher section, then (after 50 BC) in the background of landscapes which provided a stage for mythological stories, theatrical masks, or decorations.

During the reign of [[Augustus]], the style evolved. False architectural elements opened up wide expanses with which to paint artistic compositions. A structure inspired by stage sets developed, whereby one large central [[wikt:tableau|tableau]] is flanked by two smaller ones. In this style, the illusionistic tendency continued, with a 'breaking up' of walls with painted architectural elements or scenes.  The landscape elements eventually took over to cover the entire wall, with no framing device, so it looked to the viewer as if he or she was merely looking out of a room onto a real scene. Basically, the more developed Second Style was the antithesis of the First Style. Instead of confining and strengthening the walls, the goal was to break down the wall to show scenes of nature and the outside world. Much of the depth of the mature Second Style comes from the use of aerial (atmospheric) perspective that blurred the appearance of objects further away. Thus, the foreground is rather precise while the background is somewhat indistinctly purple, blue, and gray.

One of the most recognized and unique pieces representing the Second Style is the [[Dionysian Mysteries|Dionysiac mystery]] frieze in the [[Villa of the Mysteries]]. This work depicts the Dionysian Cult that was made up of mostly women. In the scene, however, one boy is depicted.

Fashionable particularly from the 40s BC onwards, it began to wane in the final decades BC.

An example is the architectural painting at the [[Villa Boscoreale]] at [[Boscoreale]] (c. 40 BC).

== Third style ==
[[Image:Villa-Farnesina22.jpg|thumb|right|Fresco in the Third style, from Casa della Farnesina in [[Trastevere]]]]
The ''Third style'', or ''ornate style'', was popular around 20–10 BC as a reaction to the austerity of the previous period. It leaves room for more figurative and colorful decoration, with an overall more ornamental feeling, and often presents great finesse in execution. This style is typically noted as simplistically elegant.

Its main characteristic was a departure from illusionistic devices, although these (along with figural representation) later crept back into this style. It obeyed strict rules of symmetry dictated by the central element, dividing the wall into 3 horizontal and 3 to 5 vertical zones. The vertical zones would be divided up by geometric motifs or bases, or slender columns of foliage hung around [[candelabra]].  Delicate motifs of birds or semi-fantastical animals appeared in the background. Plants and characteristically Egyptian animals were often introduced, part of the ''Egyptomania'' in Roman art after Augustus' defeat of [[Cleopatra]] and annexation of Egypt in 30 BC.

These paintings were decorated with delicate linear fantasies, predominantly [[monochromatic]], that replaced the three-dimensional worlds of the Second Style. An example is the [[Villa of Livia]] in [[Prima Porta]] outside of Rome (c. 30–20 BC). Also included in this style are paintings similar to the one found in Cubiculum 15 of the Villa of [[Agrippa Postumus]] in [[Boscotrecase]] (c. 10 BC). These involve a delicate architectural frame over a blank, monochromatic background with only a small scene located in the middle, like a tiny floating landscape.

It was found in [[Rome]] until 40 AD and in the Pompeii area until 60 AD.

==Fourth style==
[[File:Casa dei vettii - pannel fresco.jpg|thumb|right|Fresco in the Fourth style, from [[House of the Vettii]]]]
Characterized as a [[baroque]] reaction to the Third Style's mannerism, the Fourth Style in Roman wall painting (c. 60–79 AD) is generally less ornamented than its predecessor. The style was, however, much more complex. It revives large-scale narrative painting and panoramic vistas while retaining the architectural details of the Second and First Styles. In the Julio-Claudian phase (c. 20–54 AD), a textile-like quality dominates and tendrils seem to connect all the elements on the wall. The colors warm up once again, and they are used to advantage in the depiction of scenes drawn from mythology.

The overall feeling of the walls typically formed a mosaic of ''framed'' pictures that took up entire walls. The lower zones of these walls tended to be composed of the First Style. Panels were also used with floral designs on the walls. A prime example of the Fourth Style is the Ixion Room in the [[House of the Vettii]] in Pompeii. One of the largest contributions seen in the Fourth Style is the advancement of still life with intense space and light. Shading was very important in the Roman still life. This style was never truly seen again until 17th and 18th centuries with the Dutch. It was also used in the 17th and 18th centuries with the English.

'''''Promises! Promises!''''' (presented as '''''Promises... Promises!''''' on screen) is a 1963 unrated [[sex comedy]] film produced by [[Tommy Noonan]], released toward the end of the [[Hays code]]'s existence and before the [[MPAA film rating system]] became effective. It was the first [[Hollywood]] motion picture release of the sound era to feature a [[Mainstream#In film|mainstream]] star—[[Jayne Mansfield]]—in the [[nude]], though had the [[Unfinished creative work|unfinished]] ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'', which starred [[Marilyn Monroe]], been released in 1962 as planned, it would have been entitled to claim that distinction.

==Production==
Made on a modest budget, the film's publicity centered on Mansfield's nude scenes as the main attraction. She also sings two songs in the film{{spaced ndash}}"I'm in Love" (also known as the "Lullaby of Love") and "Promise Her Anything".&lt;ref name="faris-94"&gt;{{cite book | first = Jocelyn | last = Faris | title = Jayne Mansfield: a bio-bibliography | page = 94 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-313-28544-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production went through so much bickering between producer/actor Tommy Noonan and Mansfield that Noonan had to fly in Jet Fore, a publicist from [[20th Century Fox]], to keep peace on the set.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Strait, ''Here They Are Jayne Mansfield'', page 146, SP Books, 1992, {{ISBN|1-56171-146-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mansfield's husband, [[Mickey Hargitay]], also had a lead role in the film.

[[Tommy Noonan]] had offered the role of Claire to [[Mamie Van Doren]], but she declined and was replaced with [[Marie McDonald]]. [[Ceil Chapman]] worked on McDonald’s wardrobe for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filmography by type for Ceil Chapman|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152320/filmotype|work=IMDB|publisher=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It turned out to be McDonald's final screen appearance.

The film was presented for the first time on television in its uncut form in 1984 on the [[Playboy Channel]]. The film was one of several dozen sound films to have been released in full-length form on [[Super 8mm]] in the 1970s. The film was released on VHS and Beta videotape in the 1980s. On February 14, 2006, [[VCI Home Video]] released the film on DVD with extras such as original trailers and a gallery of stills from the ''Playboy'' issue along with previously unreleased [[lobby card]]s.

==Plot==
Sandy Brooks (Mansfield) is desperate to get pregnant, but her husband Jeff (Tommy Noonan), a television script writer, is too stressed out to make love to her. In an attempt at a sea change, they go on a pleasure cruise and meet another couple, Claire and King Banner ([[Marie McDonald]] and [[Mickey Hargitay]]).&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news | last = Brennan | first = Sandra | title = Promises! Promises! | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2006-11-25 | url = http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=39496 | accessdate = 2006-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both couples set out on a drunken spree. They end up changing partners when retiring to their rooms. Later both women discover that they're pregnant, and set out to find whether the fathers are their own or the other's husband.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Nude scenes==
[[File:Jayne Mansfield and Tommy Noonan in Promises Promises.jpg|thumb|left|Mansfield and [[Tommy Noonan]] in the most repeated nude scene of the movie]]
It was the first [[Hollywood]] motion picture release of the sound era to feature a [[mainstream]] star—[[Jayne Mansfield]]—in the [[nude]].&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{cite book | last = Black | first = Gregory D. | title = Hollywood Censored: Morality Codes, Catholics, and the Movies (Cambridge Studies in the History of Mass Communication) | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | date = January 26, 1996 | location = | pages = | isbn = 0-521-56592-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; That distinction was to have gone to [[Marilyn Monroe]], who shot a nude scene for director [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' in 1962, but the film went unfinished after Monroe's death. The first movie featuring a mainstream star fully nude was ''[[A Daughter of the Gods]]'' (1916) featuring [[Annette Kellerman]], but the [[Hays code]] had brought an end to nudity in mainstream American films.&lt;ref name="black"/&gt;

Mansfield appears undressed in three scenes in ''Promises! Promises!''. These three scenes are repeated a few times in the movie as [[dream sequence]]s. The first and longest (59 seconds) in a part of the scene where she sings "I'm In Love" semi-nude in a foam filled bathtub, then bends over with her back to the camera.&lt;ref name="faris-94"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hosoda&gt;Craig Hosoda, ''The Bare Facts Video Guide'', page 137, Bare Facts, 1991, {{ISBN|0-9625474-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second when she towels herself off (4 seconds), and the most repeated (4 times) third when she writhes around on a bed (6 seconds).&lt;ref name=hosoda/&gt; Mansfield reportedly drank some champagne in order to give her the will to get undressed in front of the camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Promises! Promises! (1963) | publisher = IMDB | date = | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057428/ | accessdate = 2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the film actually showed her only [[Toplessness|topless]], a photo in [[Kenneth Anger]]'s book ''[[Hollywood Babylon]]'' shows Mansfield on the set completely nude with [[pubic hair]] visible.&lt;ref name="babylon"&gt;{{cite book | last = Anger | first = Kenneth | authorlink = Kenneth Anger | title = [[Hollywood Babylon|Hollywood Babylon: The Legendary Underground Classic of Hollywood's Darkest and Best Kept Secrets]] | publisher = Dell (Reissue edition) | date = November 15, 1981 | location = USA | pages = | isbn = 0-440-15325-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, [[8 mm film]] mail order companies sold the nude footage.&lt;ref name="faris-94"/&gt; After Mansfield's death, the documentary ''[[The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield]]'' (1968) included nude scenes from this film and pages from the ''Playboy'' pictorial, along with scenes from her other films including ''[[Too Hot to Handle (1960 film)|Too Hot to Handle]]'' (1960), ''[[The Loves of Hercules]]'' (1960) and ''[[L'Amore Primitivo]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Mike | last = Quarles | title = Down and Dirty: Hollywood's Exploitation Filmmakers and Their Movies | page = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a set of photographs published in a ''[[Playboy]]'' pictorial (titled ''The Nudest Jayne Mansfield''), Mansfield stares at her breast, as does [[T. C.

'''''Seattle Fishermen's Memorial''''', or '''''Fisherman's Memorial''''', is an outdoor sculpture by Ronald Petty, installed at [[Fishermen's Terminal]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], in the United States.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|title=Seattle Fishermen's Memorial, (sculpture).|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!317189~!0#focus|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=February 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument was designed in 1987 and dedicated in October 1988. It commemorates Seattle fisherman who died since 1900.

==Description==
[[File:Seattle Fishermen's Memorial 02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Corner of the memorial's base and the adjacent wall]]

Ronald Petty's ''Seattle Fishermen's Memorial'' is installed at Docks 8 and 9 at Seattle's [[Fishermen's Terminal]]. The monument features a {{Convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} cast stone column supporting a [[Bronze sculpture|bronze]] standing male figure, who holds a fishing line in his proper right hand. A fish is attached to the end of the line. The column's base is a bronze relief depicting 32 "sea creatures", including fish. Adjacent to the column is a concrete wall with bronze plaques displaying the names of around 460 Seattle fishermen who died since 1900.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Seattle Fishermen's Memorial 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Wreath in memory of the dead of the ''Arctic Rose'', 2007]]

The memorial was designed in 1987 to "honor commercial fishermen from the Seattle area who have been lost at sea". It was dedicated on October 8, 1988. The sculpture was surveyed and deemed "well maintained" by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s "[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]" program in January 1994. It is administered by the Seattle Fishermen's Memorial Foundation.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

[[File:Society of Western Artists Poster.jpg|thumb|A 1909 poster for an exhibit by the society in Indianapolis.]]
The '''Society of Western Artists''' was founded by [[William Forsyth (artist)|William Forsyth]], [[T. C. Steele]], [[J. Ottis Adams]], [[John Elwood Bundy]] and fourteen other artists in 1896.

== Objective of Society ==

The Society of Western Artists "was organized in 1896 for the purpose of uniting artists in fellowship and of combining their efforts in the advancement of Art. As one of the means to this end the Society gathers together, annually, a collection of representative works, chiefly done in the middle west, and exhibits the collection in various cities."&lt;ref&gt;"Catalogue of the Eleventh Annual Exhibition of the Society of Western Artists", ''The Art Institute of Chicago'', December 6 to December 26, 1906, page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Area of Activity ==

These painters most of whom were impressionists were active primarily in the American Midwest.

== Other Members ==

Other members included [[Frank J. Girardin]], [[Frank Reaugh]] and [[Mathias Alten]], and the miniature portraitist [[Edward William Carlson]].

== Development as a Society ==

"The Society of Western Artists feels that it has passed beyond its first youth, and that it can afford to take upon itself a more critical and dignified attitude."—Edmund H. Wuerpel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author= | title =The Fourth Annual Exhibition of the Society of Western Artists | journal =Brush &amp; Pencil | volume =5 | issue =4 | page=165 | publisher = | location = | date =January 1900| jstor =25505502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Perry, Rachel Berenson, ''T. C. Steele and the Society of Western Artists, 1896–1914'',  Indiana University Press,  June 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Magdalen Reading''''' is one of three surviving fragments of a large mid-15th-century [[Panel painting|oil-on-panel]] [[altarpiece]] by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. The panel, originally [[oak]], was completed some time between 1435 and 1438 and has been in the [[National Gallery]], London since 1860. It shows a woman with the pale skin, high cheek bones and oval eyelids typical of the idealised portraits of noble women of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky pp.&amp;nbsp;258–9 (writing before the painting had been cleaned of its overpaint): "Soon after the completion of the 'Descent from the Cross,' that is to say, in 1436–1437, Roger would seem to have produced two works in which the youthful feminine types of the Escorial picture, still vaguely Flémallesque, appear refined to greater spirituality: a major composition, apparently a ''Virgo inter Virgines,'' of which only a fragment, the 'Magdalen Reading' in the National Gallery at London, survives; and the beautiful "Madonna Duran" or "Madonna in Red" in the Prado".&lt;/ref&gt; She is identifiable as the [[Mary Magdalene|Magdalen]] from the jar of ointment placed in the foreground, which is her traditional attribute in Christian art. She is presented as completely absorbed in her reading, a model of the contemplative life, repentant and absolved of past sins. In Catholic tradition the [[Mary of Bethany#Catholic identification with Mary Magdalene|Magdalen was conflated]] with both [[Mary of Bethany]] who anointed the feet of Jesus with oil&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|12:3–8}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:36–48}} is also relevant.&lt;/ref&gt; and the unnamed "sinner" of {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:36–50}}. [[Iconography]] of the Magdalen commonly shows her with a book, in a moment of reflection, in tears, or with eyes averted.

The background of the painting had been [[overpainting|overpainted]] with a thick layer of brown paint. A cleaning between 1955 and 1956 revealed the figure standing behind the Magdalene and the kneeling figure with its bare foot protruding in front of her, with a landscape visible through a window. The two partially seen figures are both cut off at the edges of the London panel. The figure above her has been identified as belonging to a fragment in the [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]], Lisbon, which shows the head of [[Saint Joseph]], while another Lisbon fragment, showing what is believed to be [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], is thought to be from the same larger work.&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/rogier-van-der-weyden-the-magdalen-reading The Magdalen Reading]".

The drawing shows that ''The Magdalen'' occupied the lower right-hand corner of the altarpiece. The Lisbon fragments are each a third of the size of ''The Magdalen'', which measures {{convert|62.2|x|54.4|cm|abbr=on}}.

Although internationally successful in his lifetime, van der Weyden fell from view during the 17th century, and was not rediscovered until the early 19th century. ''The Magdalen Reading'' can first be traced to an 1811 sale. After passing through the hands of a number of dealers in the Netherlands, the panel was purchased by the [[National Gallery]], London, in 1860 from a collector in Paris. It is described by art historian [[Lorne Campbell (Art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] as "one of the great masterpieces of 15th-century art and among van der Weyden's most important early works."&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998, 405"&gt;Campbell (1998), 405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:M Reading Detail2.jpg|thumb|240px|Detail showing the face and veil of Mary Magdalene painted in pure whites. The eyebrows and eyelids have been plucked in accordance with conventional ideals of beauty at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Plucked-Shaved-Braided-Renaissance-Practices/dp/193006408X Turudich] (2004), 198&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Mary Magdalene]] as depicted in early [[Renaissance art|Renaissance painting]] is a composite of various biblical figures. Here, she is based on [[Mary of Bethany]], who is identified as the Magdalene in the Roman Catholic tradition. Mary of Bethany sat at Jesus' feet and "listened to His Word", and thus is seen as a contemplative figure. The counterpoint is Mary's sister [[Martha]] who, representative of the active life, wished that Mary would help her serve.&lt;ref name="jj54"&gt;Jones (2011), 54&lt;/ref&gt; Mary is shown by van der Weyden as youthful, sitting in quiet piety with her head tilted and eyes modestly averted from the viewer. She is absorbed in her reading of a holy book, the covers of which include a ''chemise'' of white cloth, a common form of protective binding. Four coloured cloth bookmarks are tied to a gold bar near the top of the spine. According to Lorne Campbell, the manuscript "looks rather like a 13th-century French Bible" and is "clearly a devotional text".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 395–396, 398; quotes 396, 398.&lt;/ref&gt; It was rare for contemporary portraits to show women reading, and if the model herself could read then she was likely from a noble family.&lt;ref name="B58"&gt;Belloli (2001), 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Weyden often linked form and meaning, and in this fragment the semicircular outline of the Magdalene reinforces her quiet detachment from her surroundings.&lt;ref name="jj54"/&gt;  She is seated on a red cushion and rests her back against a wooden [[sideboard]]. By her feet is her usual [[emblem|attribute]] of an [[alabaster]] jar; in the [[Gospel]]s she brought spices to the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998),398; {{Bibleref2|Mark|16:1}} and {{Bibleref2|Luke|24:1}}. Another passage, taken in the [[Middle Ages]] to refer to the Magdalene, {{Bibleref2|John|12:3–8}} is the source of the [[alabaster]] jar.&lt;/ref&gt; The view through the window is of a distant canal, with an [[Archery|archer]] atop the garden wall and a figure walking on the other side of the water, whose reflection shows in the water.&lt;ref name="P54"&gt;Potterton (1977), 54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M Reading Detail.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Detail showing the prayer book, likely a [[book of hours]], decorated with white cloth and gold clasps.]]
Van der Weyden's pose for the Magdalene is similar to a number of female religious figures painted by his master [[Robert Campin]] or his workshop.&lt;ref name="KC" /&gt;  It closely resembles, in theme and tone, the figure of [[Saint Barbara]] in Campin's ''[[The Werl Triptych|Werl Altarpiece]]'',&lt;ref name="KC"&gt;Clark (1960), 45&lt;/ref&gt; and also the Virgin in an ''[[Annunciation]]'' attributed to Campin in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 400; the ''[[Merode Altarpiece]]'' is another version of this composition, though the Virgin's figure there is less similar.&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically for a van der Weyden, the Magdalen's face has an almost sculpted look, and the elements of her clothes are conveyed in minute detail. She wears a green robe; in medieval art the Magdalene is usually depicted naked (sometimes clad only in her long hair) or in richly coloured dress, typically red, blue or green, almost never in white.&lt;ref&gt;Salih (2002), 130&lt;/ref&gt; Her robe is tightly pulled below her bust by a blue [[sash]], while the gold [[brocade]] of her [[Petticoat|underskirt]] is adorned by a jewelled hem.&lt;ref name="B58" /&gt; Art critic Charles Darwent observed that the Magdalen's past as a "[[Prostitution|fallen woman]]" is hinted at by the [[Nap (textile)|nap]] in the [[fur]] lining of her dress and the few strands of hair loose from her veil.  Darwent wrote, "Even her fingers, absent-mindedly circled, suggest completeness. In her mix of purity and eroticism, van der Weyden's Magdalen feels whole; but she isn't."&lt;ref name="Darw"&gt;Darwent, Charles. "[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/rogier-van-der-weyden-master-of-passions-museum-leuven-belgium-1793708.html Rogier van der Weyden: Master of Passions, Museum Leuven, Belgium]". ''[[The Independent]]'', 27 September 2009. Retrieved 1 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval period, fur symbolized female sexuality and was commonly associated with the Magdalene. Medieval historian Philip Crispin explains that artists such as [[Hans Memling|Memling]] and [[Quentin Matsys|Matsys]] often portrayed the Magdalen in furs and notes that she "is noticeably dressed in fur-lined garments in ''The Magdalen Reading'' by Rogier van der Weyden".&lt;ref&gt;Crispin (2008), 157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M Reading Detail3.jpg|thumb|240px|Detail showing the jar and row of nails on the timber floor at the lower right corner of the panel. Note the attention paid to the gilded clasp and fall of the shadow.]]

The level of detail used in portraying the Magdalene has been described by Campbell as "far exceed[ing]" [[Jan van Eyck|van Eyck]]. Her lips are painted with a shades of [[vermilion]], white and red which are mixed into each other to give a transparent look at the edges. The fur lining of her dress is painted in a range of greys running from almost pure white to pure black. Rogier gave the fur a textured look by painting stripes parallel to the line of the dress and then feathering the paint before it dried. The gold on the cloth is rendered with a variety of [[impasto]], grid and dots of varying colour and size.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998 402"&gt;Campbell (1998), 402&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the objects around her are also closely detailed, in particular the wooden floor and nails, the folds of the Magdalene's dress, the costume of the figures in the exterior and the beads of Joseph's rosary.&lt;ref name="jj54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P54"/&gt; The effect of falling light is closely studied; Joseph's crystal [[Rosary#Rosary beads|rosary beads]] have bright highlights, while subtle delineations of light and shade can be seen in the sideboard's tracery and in the clasps of her book. Mary is absorbed in her reading and seemingly unaware of her surroundings. Van der Weyden has given her a quiet dignity although he is generally seen as the more emotional of the master Netherlandish painters of the era, in particular when contrasted with [[Jan van Eyck]].&lt;ref name="P54"/&gt;

Lorne Campbell describes the tiny figure of the woman seen through the window and her reflection in the water as "small miracles of painting", and says that "the attention to detail far exceeds that of Jan van Eyck and the skill of execution is astounding". He notes that these tiny details would have been impossible for a viewer to observe when the altarpiece was in its intended position.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 396 and 402&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas of the panel, however, have been described as dull and uninspired. One critic wrote that the areas of the floor and most of the cupboard behind her seem unfinished and "much too narrow and papery in effect".&lt;ref name="Darw" /&gt; A number of objects placed on the cupboard are now barely visible save for their bases.&lt;ref&gt;These objects are often cut off in reproduction.&lt;/ref&gt; The object on the right seated on legs alongside a box is likely a small [[pitcher (container)|pitcher]], possibly a [[reliquary]]. A moulding to the left of the cupboard may represent a doorway.&lt;ref name="JW35"&gt;Ward (1971), 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Altarpiece fragment==
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - St Joseph - WGA25722.jpg|thumb|220px|''Head of Saint Joseph'' (fragment). {{convert|21|x|18|cm|abbr=on}}. [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]], Lisbon. This panel is thought to show [[Saint Joseph]], whose body is visible to his upper arm in ''The Magdalen Reading''.]]

''Virgin and Child with Saints'',&lt;ref name="C49"&gt;Campbell (2004), 49&lt;/ref&gt; a drawing in Stockholm's [[Nationalmuseum]], is believed to be a study of a portion of the original altarpiece by a follower of van der Weyden,&lt;ref name="C398-400"&gt;Campbell (1998), 398–400&lt;/ref&gt; who possibly may have been the [[Master of the Drapery Studies|Master of the Coburger Rundblätter]]. The drawing has a loosely sketched background and shows, from left to right: an unidentified bishop saint with [[mitre]] and [[crosier]] making a blessing gesture; a narrow gap with a few wavy vertical lines suggesting a start at the outline of a further kneeling figure; a barefoot bearded figure in a rough robe identified as Saint [[John the Baptist]]; a seated Virgin holding on her lap the Christ Child who leans to the right, looking at a book; and holding the book, a kneeling beardless male identified as [[John the Evangelist]]. The drawing stops at the end of John's robe, at about the point on the London panel where Joseph's walking stick meets John and the Magdalene's robes.&lt;ref name="C398-400" /&gt; This suggests that the Magdalene panel was the first to be cut from the larger work.

A possible representation of [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], it is of lower quality than the other two known fragments, indicating that it was probably completed by members of van der Weyden's workshop.]]

At an unknown point before 1811, the original altarpiece was broken into at least three pieces,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 394, 398&lt;/ref&gt; possibly due to damage, although ''The Magdalen'' fragment is in good condition. The black overpaint was likely added after the early 17th century when Netherlandish painting had fallen from favour and was unfashionable. Campbell believes that after the removal of the background detail "it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch seventeenth-century paintings".&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998, 405"/&gt; From the size of three surviving panels in relation to the drawing, it is estimated that the original was at least 1&amp;nbsp;m high by 1.5&amp;nbsp;m wide; the bishop and the Magdalene seem to clearly mark the horizontal extremities, but the extent of the picture above and below the surviving elements and the drawing cannot be judged. Such a size is comparable with smaller altarpieces of the period.&lt;ref name="C398-400"/&gt; The background was overpainted with a thick layer of black/brown pigment until it was cleaned in 1955; it was only after the layer's removal that it was linked to the upper body and head of Joseph from the Lisbon piece. These two works were not recorded in inventory until 1907, when they appear in the collection of Léo Lardus in [[Suresnes]], France.&lt;ref name="C49"/&gt;

The London panel shows much of the clothing of two other figures from the original altarpiece. To the left of the Magdalene is the red robe of what appears to be a kneeling figure. The figure and robe, and less precisely the background, match a kneeling Saint John the Evangelist.&lt;ref name="C49"/&gt; Behind the Magdalen is a standing figure in blue and red robes, with linear [[rosary]] beads in one hand&lt;ref&gt;Joseph's beads closely resemble those in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', which was painted around the same time and is on permanent display in the National Gallery alongside ''The Magdalen Reading''. See Jones, 46, 54&lt;/ref&gt; and a walking stick in the other. A panel at the [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]] in [[Lisbon]] shows the head of a figure believed to be the [[Saint Joseph]]; the background and clothes match with those of the figure behind the Magdalen on the London panel.&lt;ref name="C49"/&gt;

[[File:The Magdalen Reading uncleaned.jpg|thumb|260px|Cropped 1930s black and white photograph of the panel before it was cleaned of the overpaint.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Davies (museum director)|Davies, Martin]] (1937), 140, 142–145&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the overpainting and the breaking up of the altarpiece are unknown.]]

There is a further small panel in Lisbon of a female head, richly or royally dressed, which first appeared in 1907 with the Joseph panel when it was recorded in the inventory of Leo Nardus at [[Suresnes]]. The figure may represent [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], and from both the angle of her cloth and the fact that the river behind her would be parallel to that in the exterior of the London panel it can be assumed that she was kneeling.&lt;ref name="Campell49"&gt;Campell (2009), 49&lt;/ref&gt; In the Stockholm drawing she is omitted, or only traces of her dress shown. The Joseph panel has a sliver of a view through a window to an exterior scene; if the other female is presumed to be kneeling, the trees above the waterway aligns with those in the London panel.&lt;ref name="C398-400" /&gt;  Some art historians, including [[Martin Davies (museum director)|Martin Davies]] and John Ward,&lt;ref&gt;Davies and Ward have published, in 1957 and 1971 respectively, diagrammatic reconstructions of the altarpiece based on evidence available of the time. Campbell is responsible for much of the scholarship since.&lt;/ref&gt; have been slow to allow the Catherine panel as part of the altarpiece, though it is undoubtedly by van der Weyden or a near-contemporary follower. Evidence against this link includes the fact that the moulding of the window to the left of the Gulbenkian female saint is plain, while that next to Saint Joseph is [[chamfer]]ed. Such an inconsistency in a single van der Weyden work is unusual. The panels are of equal thickness (1.3&amp;nbsp;cm) and of near-identical size; the Saint Catherine panel measures {{convert|18.6|x|21.7|cm|abbr=on}}, the Saint Joseph {{convert|18.2|x|21|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = "W32"&gt;Ward (1971), 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorne Campbell thinks that though the Catherine head is "obviously less well drawn and less successfully painted than the ''Magdalen''",&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998 402"/&gt; it "seems likely" that all three fragments came from the same original work; he points out that "about half way up the right edge of this fragment ["Catherine"] is a small triangle of red, outlined by a continuous underdrawn brushstroke&amp;nbsp;... It is likely that the red is part of the contour of the missing figure of the Baptist".&lt;ref name="C398-400" /&gt;  The small piece is on the outermost edge of the panel, and only visible when it was removed from the frame. Ward believes the piece corresponds directly with the folds of John's robes.&lt;!-- Campbell says J the Baptist &amp; Ward says J the Evangelist? Is this a mistake? --&gt;&lt;ref name = "W32"/&gt;

The Stockholm drawing contains a narrow blank gap to the right of the bishop with a few indistinct lines that could represent the lower profile of the kneeling figure of Saint Catherine. Although none of the faces in the three surviving panels match any in the drawing, a 1971 reconstruction by art historian John Ward—which combined all of the works into a composition of a central Virgin and Child flanked by six saints—is widely accepted. The Stockholm drawing's original location or history before the 19th century is unknown, except that the ''[[recto and verso|verso]]'' shows a surviving carving of the Virgin and Child attributed to a [[Brussels]] workshop from about 1440. This carving is also now in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 398–400, illustrating the drawing, and with a drawing of a full reconstruction.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Weyden, Rogier van der - Descent from the Cross - Detail women (left).jpg|260px|thumb|Detail from ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'',  c. 1435. Here van der Weyden portrays the tears and partially visible eyes of [[Mary of Clopas]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 34&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Van der Weyden's depiction of the Magdalen is based on Mary of Bethany,&lt;ref name="jj54"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Described as "This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair".{{Bibleref2|John|11:1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified by the time of [[Pope Gregory I]] as the repentant prostitute of {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:36–50}}.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara (1994), 24&lt;/ref&gt; She then became associated with weeping and reading: Christ's mercy causes the eyes of the sinner to be contrite or tearful. Early Renaissance artists often conveyed this idea by portraying contemplative eyes, associating tears with words, and in turn weeping with reading. Examples can be seen in 16th-century works by [[Tintoretto]] and [[Titian]] which show the Magdalen reading, often with her eyes averted towards her book (and presumably away from a [[Gaze|male gaze]]), or looking up to the heavens or, sometimes, glancing coyly towards the viewer.&lt;ref name = McMullan212/&gt; Writing in "The Crying Face", Mosche Barasch explains that in van der Weyden's time the gesture of averting or concealing the eyes became a "pictorial formula for crying".&lt;ref&gt;Barasch (1987), 23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Campin Annunciation triptych.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''[[Mérode Altarpiece|Annunciation]]'', attributed to Robert Campin, [[Brussels]], c. 1427–1432, where the figure of the Virgin is close to van der Weyden's London Magdalen.]]

By the medieval period, reading became synonymous with devotion, which involved withdrawal from public view. Van der Weyden's placement of the Magdalen in an interior scene reflects the increasing literacy of domestic or laywomen in the mid-15th century. The increased production of devotional texts showed that noble women of the period routinely read texts such as a [[psalter]] or [[book of hours]] in the privacy of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Green (2007), 10–12, 119&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the Magdalen herself was a reader, by the 17th century she was firmly established as such in the visual arts. Because the Magdalen was present at Christ's death and subsequent resurrection, she was seen as the bearer of news—a witness—and hence directly associated with the text.&lt;ref&gt;Jagodzinski (1999), 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

The Magdalen imagery further draws on the idea of Christ as the word, represented by a book, with the Magdalen as the reader learning of her own life story in a moment of reflection and repentance.  Her devotion to reading reflects her traditional status as the piously repentant harlot, as well as a prophetess or seer.&lt;ref name = McMullan212&gt;Badir (2007), 212&lt;/ref&gt;  According to legend, the Magdalen lived the last 30 years of her life as a hermit in [[Sainte-Baume]] and is often shown with a book, reading or writing, symbolizing her later years of contemplation and repentance.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (2009), 174&lt;/ref&gt; By the 13th century she acquired the imagery of a once-shamed woman who, clothed in long hair, now hid her nakedness in exile and "borne by angels, floats between heaven and earth".&lt;ref&gt;Maisch (1998), 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The Magdalen's ointment jar was common in the lexicon of art in van der Weyden's period. Mary of Bethany may have used a jar when she repented of her sins at Christ's feet in her home; by the Renaissance, the image of the Magdalen was of the woman who bathed Christ's feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1996), 170&lt;/ref&gt; She signified the "sacrament of anointing ([[Chrism]] and [[Anointing|Unction]])" by pouring precious [[spikenard]] on Christ's feet at his tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolos-Cappadona (2005), 215&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and provenance==

The altarpiece's date is uncertain but believed to be between 1435 and 1438. Van der Weyden was made painter to the city of Brussels in 1435, and it is believed to have been painted after this appointment. The National Gallery gives "before 1438".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/rogier-van-der-weyden Rogier van der Weyden]". [[National Gallery]], London. Retrieved 24 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian John Ward notes that the altarpiece was one of van der Weyden's first masterpieces, created early in his career when he was still heavily influenced by [[Robert Campin]].&lt;ref name="JW35"/&gt; He proposes a c. 1437 date based on similarities to Campin's ''[[The Werl Triptych|Werl Altarpiece]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1971), 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Madonna and Child with Saints Master of the Koberger.JPG|thumb|280px|The Stockholm drawing, attributed to the Master of the Coburger Rundblätter, likely shows the portion of the altarpiece to the left of the Magdalen. The kneeling figure to the far right is probably Saint [[John the Evangelist]], some of whose red drapery can be seen in the London fragment.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1971), 27&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's position on the lower right hand corner (out of view) is guessed at by Ward from van der Weyden's positioning of similar figures in other works.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1971), 29&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Because van der Weyden, like most of the [[Early Netherlandish painting|early Netherlandish painters]], was not rediscovered until the early 19th century, many of his works were wrongly attributed or dated, and major pieces such as the Berlin ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' continue to emerge. Conversely, when a number of pieces considered either by van der Weyden or assistants under his supervision were cleaned in the mid- to late 20th century, his hand or direct influence was disproved,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 7, 126, 127&lt;/ref&gt; or in the case of the Magdalen, associated with other images whose attribution had been uncertain.

''The Magdalen Reading'' can first be traced to an 1811 sale of the estate of Cassino, a little-known collector in [[Haarlem]],&lt;ref&gt;Campbell; Stock (2009), 441&lt;/ref&gt; when the work was already cut down.&lt;ref name="Darw"/&gt; The painting is recorded in the inventory of Demoiselles Hoofman, also of Haarlem.&lt;ref name="C50"&gt;Campbell (2004), 50&lt;/ref&gt; After passing to the Nieuwenhuys brothers, who were leading dealers in art of the early Netherlandish period, it moved to the collector Edmond Beaucousin&lt;ref name="C50" /&gt; in Paris, whose "small but choice" collection of early Netherlandish paintings was purchased for the [[National Gallery]], London by [[Charles Lock Eastlake]] in 1860; an acquisition that also included two [[Robert Campin]] portraits and panels by [[Simon Marmion]] (1425–1489).&lt;ref name ="R203"&gt;Borchert (2005), 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 13–14, 394&lt;/ref&gt; This was during a period of acquisition intended to establish the international prestige of the gallery.&lt;ref name ="R203"/&gt; Probably before 1811, all the background except the red robe on the left and the alabaster jar and floorboards was overpainted in plain brown, which was not removed until the cleaning begun in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 394, with photo on 395&lt;/ref&gt;  In general the "painted surface is in very good condition", although better in the parts that were not overpainted, and there are a few small losses.&lt;ref name="C394"&gt;Campbell (1998), 394&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Magdalen Reading'' was transferred from its original oak to a [[mahogany]] panel (West Indian [[swietenia]])&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 395&lt;/ref&gt; by unknown craftsmen sometime between 1828 and when the National Gallery acquired it in 1860. Campbell states that the transfer was "Certainly after 1828, probably after 1845, and certainly before 1860", the year it was acquired by the National Gallery.&lt;ref name="C394"/&gt; Artificial [[ultramarine]]-coloured paint found in the transfer ground indicates that the change of panel took place after 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1997), 85&lt;/ref&gt; The heads in Lisbon are still on their original oak panels.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 398&lt;/ref&gt; The Stockholm drawing was discovered in a German inventory c. 1916 and is likely of Swedish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Bjurström (1985), 166&lt;/ref&gt; It was bequeathed by a Norwegian collector, Christian Langaad, to the Swedish [[Nationalmuseum|National Museum of Fine Arts]] in 1918.&lt;ref name="C49" /&gt;

'''The Magic Castle,''' located in the [[Hollywood]] district of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], is a [[nightclub]] for [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]] and magic enthusiasts, as well as the clubhouse for the [[#Academy of Magical Arts|Academy of Magical Arts]]. It bills itself as "the most unusual private club in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9GqMCwAAQBAJ&amp;dq|title=101 Magic Tricks|last=Miles|first=Bryan|date=|publisher=Quarry Books|year=2016|isbn=9781631590726|location=|pages=127|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only members and their guests are allowed entrance, though courtesy invitations can be obtained. During a typical evening there are numerous magic shows and historic displays, as well as a full service dining room and numerous bars. The atmosphere is reminiscent of classic night club days, and a strict [[dress code]] is enforced.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magiccastle.com/about/|title=About|website=The Magic Castle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many celebrities have performed at the Magic Castle, including [[Orson Welles]], [[Johnny Carson]],  [[Steve Martin]] and [[Neil Patrick Harris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/scene/news/neil-patrick-harris-knows-all-the-magic-tricks-at-nothing-to-hide-opening-1200803610/|title=Neil Patrick Harris Knows All the Magic Tricks at ‘Nothing to Hide’ Opening|date=November 7, 2013|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. One of the Castle's most famous performers was the late [[Dai Vernon]], an expert in [[sleight of hand]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= Lee A.|last= Daniels|authorlink= |title= Dai Vernon, 98; An Expert Magician Who Taught Others |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DB1730F93AA1575BC0A964958260 |quote= Dai Vernon, a sleight of hand artist who was a mentor to many of the most accomplished magicians of the last half-century, died Aug. 21 at the home of a son, Edward Wingfield Verner, in Ramona, Calif., where he had lived for the last two years.

==Country Club of Magic==
[[Image:MagicCastle03.jpg|thumb|left|Magic Castle entrance]]
The Magic Castle is a performance venue, restaurant and private club. A typical evening features several magic and sometimes variety arts performances, as well as a full service dining room and several bars in a country club atmosphere. A dress code of formal party attire is strictly enforced.&lt;ref&gt;"Magic Castle After Dark," December 16, 2006 documentary on [[A&amp;E Network]]&lt;/ref&gt; Entry is only allowed to members and their guests.

The lobby of the Castle has no visible doors to the interior, and visitors must say a secret phrase to a sculpture of an owl to gain access, exposing the entrance to the club. Magicians perform in several different theaters, including the intimate Close-up Gallery, a larger Parlour of Prestidigitation, and the large stage in the Palace of Mystery. Nightly, five different magic performances are showcased in these three different theaters, and on weekends additional performances are added in the Peller theatre as well as Hat and Hare Pub and W.C. Fields Bar. Informal performance areas near the five bars give magician members the space for impromptu magic for guests and other patrons. In the music room, a piano is played by invisible "Irma," the Castle's "resident ghost," who takes musical requests.

In addition, there are regular Houdini Séances at the castle in the Houdini Seance room, conducted by Leo Kostka, [[Rob Zabrecky]], or [[Misty Lee]].

Those under 21 years of age are not permitted during evening performances. However, on Saturdays and Sundays, the Castle hosts an "all-ages" brunch and performances which are open to members and their guests, including those under the age of 21. During brunch, the Castle's "Junior Members" (ranging in age from 13 to 20 years old) perform in the Close-up Gallery.

==Magic Castle Junior Group==
The Magic Castle is also known for its Junior Program (the Magic Castle Junior Group). The Junior Group comprises highly skilled young magicians, many of whom have gone on to professional careers in magic. One week a year, billed as "Future Stars Week," performers from the Junior Group are showcased in evening performances in the Castle's showrooms.

==History==
The principal building of the Magic Castle is a Chateau-style or [[Chateauesque]] residence built in 1909 by real estate investor, lawyer, banker, newspaper editor, and philanthropist, Rollin B. Lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trigenic.com/html/rollin_b__lane.html|title=The True History of Rollin B. Lane, His Family and His Castle}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house was designed by architects Lyman Farwell and Oliver Dennis&lt;ref&gt;McGrew and Julian, ''Landmarks of Los Angeles'', Harry N. Abrams, Inc., NY, 1994 pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; and constructed as a near duplicate of the 1897 [[Kimberly Crest (Redlands, CA)|Kimberly Crest House and Gardens]] in [[Redlands, California]] that the architects had designed over a decade earlier. Ownership of the building remained in the Lane family until 1955 when it was sold to Thomas O. Glover, whose family still owns the property. In September 1961, the building was leased to [[Milt Larsen]], [[Bill Larsen]], and [[Irene Larsen]], who began converting it to its present state. The Magic Castle opened for business on January 2, 1963.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; Over the years several additions have been made to the original structure, allowing for the inclusion of several theaters, bars, a library and other meeting spaces. The Magic Castle was declared a [[Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="LAHCM_list"&gt;{{cite web |author=Department of City Planning |title=Designated Historic-Cultural Monuments |publisher=City of Los Angeles |url=http://www.preservation.lacity.org/monuments/ |accessdate=2012-10-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609160708/http://www.preservation.lacity.org/monuments |archivedate=2010-06-09 |df= }}&lt;!-- do not link to the PDF, it goes dead on every update --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the Castle's most famous performers was the late [[Dai Vernon]], an expert in [[sleight of hand]], who often sat in the bar area entertaining and teaching. Vernon was the Magician-in-Residence at the Castle for many years, up until his death in 1992.&lt;ref name=cremated&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = Karl | title = The Magician and the Cardsharp | year = 2005 | page = 282 | quote = He was cremated, and after the box with his ashes was brought to the Magic Castle, it was placed for display on a ledge at the top of a wall filled with photos and other memorabilia from his long life in magic.

On October 31, 2011, the Magic Castle suffered damage from a fire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/11/magic-castle-fire-reopen-friday.html|title=After fire, Magic Castle hopes to reopen Friday|first=Andrew|last=Blankstein|date=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that started in the attic.

The Academy of Magical Arts is a nonprofit [[mutual benefit corporation]] organized and devoted to the promotion and development of the art of [[magic (illusion)|magic]].

The Academy of Magical Arts was started in 1952 by William Larsen, Sr. as a loose association of magicians, although it was not officially incorporated and its organization formalized until 1962, when Larsen's sons, William Larsen, Jr. and Milt Larsen, built the Academy into an international organization. The Academy's headquarters has been the Magic Castle since 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://results.factiva.com/index/index.aspx?ref=VARTY00020060918e29e000e3 | title=Castle casts spell on Larsen clan; Founder tells his and club's history | publisher=[[Daily Variety]] | date= September 14, 2006 | first= | last= | accessdate =2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

The Academy of Magical Arts was created by William Larsen and announced in the April 1952 issue of his independent magazine of magic, [[Genii (magazine)|''Genii'']]; of which all the subscribers were automatically accorded membership. "Academy Awards" were presented by Larsen over the next several months for outstanding contributions in various areas of the magic arts. William Larsen, Sr. died at the age of 48 in July 1953. His wife and his eldest son, Bill Jr. continued the publication of the magazine but the "Academy" lacked any formal structure and the organization became dormant. In 1962, William Larsen's younger son, Milt, undertook the job of leasing and restoring an ornately styled, 1909 mansion in Hollywood, California and turning it into a meeting place for magicians which he called the "Magic Castle." As part of their plan to revive the Academy and locate it in the "Magic Castle," William Larsen, Jr. filed articles of incorporation and created a nonprofit corporation, in 1962. The Magic Castle opened its doors on January 2, 1963 as the home of the Academy of Magical Arts, Inc. From an initial membership of 50, the Academy has grown to a worldwide membership of over 5,000 today.

===Membership===

There are nearly 2,500 magician members in the Academy today.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} To become a regular member, one must first be actively practicing or involved with magic as a career or hobby and audition before the Academy's membership reviewing committee. Associate members are people who love magic and the academy. Most of the members are in the entertainment business, law, finance, and medical fields. Some of these associate members are friends of magician members who enjoy the atmosphere of the Academy. Associate Member applications must be approved by the Board of Directors. Honorary members and VIP members are presented by the Board of Directors to magicians, celebrities and individual members of the Academy who have contributed to the advancement of the art of magic. It is also possible to become a junior magician if you are between the age of 13 and 20. Membership in the Junior Group is open to anyone seriously interested in magic who is from 13 to 19 years of age. One may apply if 20 years old, but must be able to be a member in the Group for one full year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.magiccastle.com/membership/|title=Membership|last=|first=|date=|website=The Academy of Magical Arts|access-date=2017-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These junior magicians are only allowed limited use of the facilities.

===Education===
The Academy of Magic offers classes that are available to the public. The Basic Magic class is designed to provide the skills and knowledge necessary to perform basic magic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/RDFB/lib00679,103BB36A906CA633.html | title=Magic at the Castle this weekend | publisher=[[Redlands Daily Facts]] | date= July 1, 2004 | first= | last= | accessdate =2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The class combines instructor presentation, step-by-step explanation, hands-on instruction, group practice sessions and individual performance. Classes are held one night per week for six weeks, from 7:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. to 9:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. During the six weeks, the students receive a temporary six week pass that grants the privileges of a regular member, excluding magician member's lectures. They are allowed to bring one friend to stay at the castle on a Tuesday, Wednesday or Saturday brunch, but not to the classes. Men must wear a jacket and tie and women must wear a dress or skirt; no casual wear is permitted.

===Awards===

Performing awards are given in different categories at the annual "Academy of the Magical Arts Awards" event. Nominees for the performing awards are chosen from among that year's performers at The Magic Castle.

Other awards include various ''Fellowship'', ''Merit'', and ''Achievement'' awards which go to individuals who, in the view of the Academy, have made significant contributions to the field of magic.

'''''The Merry Drinker''''' is a painting by [[Frans Hals]], from 1628-1630.
==Description==
The painting has dimensions  81 x 66.5 centimeters. It is in the collection of the [[Rijksmuseum]], [[Amsterdam]].

==Analysis==
The painting shows a man wearing a leather jerkin, lace collar and cuffs, and a floppy hat tipped at an angle. He is gesturing with his right hand and holding a glass of white wine in his left hand. He seems caught in a moment of discussion with the viewer. A medallion dangles from his neck chain, which [[Hofstede de Groot]] claimed was a likeness of Prince [[Maurice of Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn03hofsuoft#page/18/mode/1up Catalog nr. 63], ''A Catalogue Raisonné of the Works of the Most Eminent Dutch Painters of the Seventeenth century Based on the work of John Smith'', Volume III (Frans Hals and Adriaen &amp; Isaac van Ostade), by Cornelis Hofstede de Groot, with the assistance of Kurt Freise and Dr. Kurt Erasmus, translated by Edward G. Hawke, Macmillan &amp; Co., London, 1910&lt;/ref&gt;  Various experts have claimed the painting represents the sense of taste. In old Dutch inventories, the theme of a "merry drinker" or "jolly toper" occurs often, and this was probably not a portrait but meant as a genre piece.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3267">"'''The Oldest Systematic Program of German Idealism'''" ({{lang-de|Das älteste Systemprogramm des deutschen Idealismus}}) is a 1796/97 essay of [[Anonymous work|unknown authorship]]. The document was first published (in German) by [[Franz Rosenzweig]] in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Richards, ''The Romantic Conception of Life: Science and Philosophy in the Age of Goethe'', University of Chicago Press, 2002, p. 124 n. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
Although the document is in [[G. W. F. Hegel]]'s handwriting, it is thought it has been written by either Hegel, [[F. W. J. Schelling]], [[Friedrich Hölderlin]], or an unknown fourth person.&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"&gt;Kai Hammermeister, ''The German Aesthetic Tradition'', Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yves Bonnefoy]] writes that it was "certainly inspired by Hölderlin."&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy, "Fable and Mythology in Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Literature and Theoretical Reflection" in ''Roman and European Mythologies'' edited by [[Wendy Doniger]], University of Chicago Press, 1992, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Glenn Magee, most Hegel scholars assume that Hegel is the author of the document.&lt;ref name="magee"&gt;Glenn Magee, ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', Cornell University Press, 2001, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Schelling, Hegel, and Hölderlin were classmates and roommates at Tübinger Stift, the seminary of the [[University of Tübingen]] at the time, and are collectively known as the "Tübingen Three". Hegel and Hölderlin were 27, and Schelling was 22.

==Content==
Raffaele Milani writes that in the essay, "...the idea of Beauty unifies all others in a fusion of the self and nature."&lt;ref&gt;Raffaele Milani, ''Art of the Landscape'', McGill-Queen's University Press, 2009, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dieter Henrich]] called the document a "program for agitation." It called for a new mythology to mediate between the present state and the future envisioned poeticized state, in which poetry will function for the arts and sciences, including philosophy.&lt;ref name="Hammermeister"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Josephson-Storm has interpreted the essay as a source on Hegel's view of [[myth]], especially Hegel's perception (in line with other eighteenth- and nineteenth-century German philosophers) that myth has disappeared and left a cultural vacuum, which Josephson-Storm argues anticipates the idea of [[disenchantment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 63-4 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Strand Magazine''''' was a monthly [[magazine]] founded by [[George Newnes]], composed of short fiction and general interest articles. It was published in the United Kingdom from January 1891&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Howard Cox|author2=Simon Mowatt|title=Technology, Organisation and Innovation: The Historical Development of the UK Magazine Industry|url=http://aut.researchgateway.ac.nz/bitstream/handle/10292/1129/Technology_organisation.pdf?sequence=1&amp;origin=publication_detail|work=Auckland University of Technology|accessdate=25 June 2016|format=Research paper|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; to March 1950, running to 711 issues,&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Mike. ''The Age of the Storytellers'', The British Library and Oak Knoll Press, p. 196. 2006. {{ISBN|0-7123-0698-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the first issue was on sale well before Christmas 1890.
Its immediate popularity is evidenced by an initial sale of nearly 300,000. Sales increased in the early months, before settling down to a circulation of almost 500,000 copies a month which lasted well into the 1930s. It was edited by [[Herbert Greenhough Smith]] from 1891 to 1930.
The magazine's original offices were in Burleigh Street off [[Strand, London|The Strand]], London. It was revived in 1998 as a quarterly magazine.

It was normally bound as six-monthly volumes, from January to June and July to December, but from the mid-1930s this varied, and the final volumes in the late 1940s ran from October to March and April to September, the final volume CXVIII (118) running from October 1949 to March 1950. 

==Fiction==
The [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories by [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] were first published in ''The Strand'' with illustrations by [[Sidney Paget]]. With the serialisation of Doyle's ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'', sales reached their peak. Readers lined up outside the magazine's offices, waiting to get the next instalment. [[E. W. Hornung]]'s stories about [[A. J. Raffles]], the "gentleman thief", first appeared in ''The Strand'' in the 1890s. Other contributors included [[Grant Allen]], [[Margery Allingham]], [[J. E. Preston Muddock]], [[H. G. Wells]], [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|E. C. Bentley]], [[Agatha Christie]], [[Mary Angela Dickens]], [[C. B. Fry]], [[Walter Goodman]], [[E. Nesbit]], [[W. W. Jacobs]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Arthur Morrison]], [[Dorothy L. Sayers]], [[Georges Simenon]], [[Edgar Wallace]], [[Max Beerbohm]], [[P. G. Wodehouse]], [[Dornford Yates]] and [[Winston Churchill]]. Once a sketch drawn by [[Queen Victoria]] of one of her children appeared with her permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/StrandMagazine3/Strand3#page/n1/mode/2up |title=''The Strand Magazine'', Volume 1, Issue 3 (March 1891), pp. 226ff |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puzzles==
In addition to the many fiction pieces and illustrations, ''The Strand'' was also known for some time as the source of ground-breaking brain teasers, under a column called "Perplexities", first written by [[Henry Dudeney]]. Dudeney introduced many new concepts to the puzzle world, including the first known [[cross-figure|crossnumber]] puzzle, in 1926. In that same year, Dudeney produced an article, "The Psychology of Puzzle Crazes", reflecting and analysing the demand for such works. He edited Perplexities from 1910 until he died in 1930. G.H. Savage became the column's editor, soon to be joined by [[W. T. Williams|William Thomas Williams]] (as W.T. Williams), who in 1935 authored the best-known [[cross-figure]] puzzle of today. The puzzle goes by many names, the original being "The Little Pigley Farm". It has also been known as "Dog's Mead", "Little Pigley", "Little Piggly Farm", "Little Pigsby", "Pilgrims’ Plot", and "Dog Days".

==Cover==
The magazine's iconic cover, an illustration looking eastwards down London's [[Strand, London|Strand]] towards [[St Mary-le-Strand]], with the title suspended on telegraph wires, was the work of Victorian artist and designer [[George Charles Haité]]. The initial cover featured a corner plaque showing the name of Burleigh Street, home to the magazine's original offices. The lettering on the plaque in Haité's design was later changed when Newnes moved to the adjacent address of Southampton Street. A variation of the same design was featured on the cover of a sister title, ''The Strand Musical Magazine''.

==Final days==
The magazine format changed to the smaller [[digest size]] in October 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Strand Magazine'' ceased publication in March 1950, forced out of the market by declining circulation and rising costs. Its last editor was [[Macdonald Hastings]], distinguished [[war correspondent]] and later TV reporter and contributor to the ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'' boys' comic.

==United States edition==

The magazine also published a United States edition from February 1891 through February 1916. In its early years, the contents of the U.S. edition were identical with those of the U.K. edition, though usually with a one-month time lag. As the years went on there were some differences in the contents of the two editions, reflecting fiction for which ''The Strand'' did not hold the U.S. rights (such as ''The Return of Sherlock Holmes'', which was commissioned by ''Collier's'') and non-fiction that would not interest most U.S. readers (such as articles about personalities in the House of Commons). The circulation of the U.S. edition was minimal in the early 1890s but was reported at 150,000 by 1898. The U.S. edition was discontinued in 1916 due to logistical difficulties arising from World War I.&lt;ref&gt;See Philip G. Bergem, A Sherlockian and Doylean Checklist of ''The Strand Magazine'', pp. 1, 5, 8-10; Frederick Faxon, "Magazine Perplexities I. ''Strand Magazine,'' 1 Bulletin of Bibliography 8, at 122 (Jan. 1899); Bliss Austin, "Wanderings on a Foreign Strand", Baker Street Miscellanea, No. 17, p. 1 (Mar. 1979); "American Strand Magazine Quits," ''The Fourth Estate'' 17 (Jan. 22, 1916).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vilcek Prizes===
The Vilcek Prizes are awarded to [[Foreign born|foreign-born]] individuals residing permanently in the [[United States]], with a legacy of outstanding achievement in the [[The arts|arts]] and sciences. The Foundation awards two Vilcek Prizes annually, one in [[Healthcare science|biomedical science]] and the other in the [[The arts|arts]] and [[humanities]]; the latter in a field designated annually by the Foundation, such as [[fine art]]s, [[architecture]], [[music]], [[filmmaking]], [[culinary art]], [[literature]], [[dance]], contemporary music, [[design]], and [[fashion]]. Each prize consists of a $100,000 cash award and a commemorative sculpture designed by Austrian-born [[Stefan Sagmeister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vilcek Prize Trophy|url=http://designarchives.aiga.org/#/entries/vilcek%20prize/_/detail/relevance/asc/0/7/8969/vilcek-prize-trophy/1|work=AIGA Design Archives|author=Sagmeister, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vilcek Prizes for Creative Promise===
The Vilcek Prizes for Creative Promise are awarded to [[Foreign born|foreign-born]] individuals who have demonstrated outstanding achievement during the early stages of their careers. Like the Vilcek Prize, the Vilcek Prizes for Creative Promise are awarded each year in the field of [[Healthcare science|biomedical science]] and a selected [[The arts|art]] field. Creative Promise applicants are required to submit [[essay]]s, personal statements, and examples of their work. To be eligible for the prize, applicants must have been born abroad, reside permanently in the [[United States]], and be within the specified age limit. As of 2013, three prizes each will be awarded in biomedical science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vilcek Foundation scholarships for foreign-born medical scientists|journal=Scope|date=July 2012|volume=16|issue=28|url=http://scope.medicine.iu.edu/archives/2012/Vol-16-No-28.htm#Opportunities-1|author=IU School of Medicine|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a designated art field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Con Edison Immigrant Artist Project Newsletter|url=http://www.nyfa.org/level3.asp?id=659&amp;fid=1&amp;sid=145&amp;print=true|publisher=New York Foundation for the Arts|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each recipient is awarded a $50,000 cash prize and a commemorative plaque.

===Masterpieces of American Modernism: From the Vilcek Collection===

''Masterpieces of American Modernism: From the Vilcek Collection'', features ninety-eight paintings, works on paper and sculptures by twenty artists - including [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Arthur Dove]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]] and [[Max Weber]].  William C. Agee contributed the book's introduction and Lewis Kachur wrote individual entries on each work.  In addition to tracing the evolution of individual artists and the movement as a whole, the book explores developments within [[American Modernism]], such as [[Synchromism]] and Color Abstraction, American [[Cubism]], and the influence of the landscape and culture of the Southwest (an issue that is explored in depth in the book's Illustrated Timeline). The Collection also highlights the contributions of immigrant artists – eight of the twenty artists were born outside the United States.  The book is prefaced by a collector's statement from [[Ján Vilček]] and Marica Vilcek and has contributions by The Vilcek Foundation's President, Rick Kinsel, and Associate Curator, Emily Schuchardt Navratil.

His main topic becomes the images of the artist's childhood and youth, the northern village and the peasant way of life, landscapes of the native land and the central Russia.
