'''''A Colour Symphony''''', Op. 24, F. 106, was written by [[Arthur Bliss]] in 1921&amp;ndash;22.&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite book|last=Randel|first=Don Michael|title=The Harvard dictionary of music|year=2003|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01163-2|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was his first major work for [[orchestra]]&lt;ref name=class/&gt; and remains one of his best known compositions. 

== Orchestration ==
The symphony is scored for 3 flutes (one doubling on piccolo), 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, double bassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, 2 tympanists, cymbals, 2 harps and strings.

==History==

''A Colour Symphony'' was written to be performed at the [[Three Choirs Festival]], held in 1922 in [[Gloucester]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The concise Oxford dictionary of music|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-860884-4|author=Bourne, Joyce|author2=Michael Kennedy|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the invitation of Sir [[Edward Elgar]], who also invited [[Herbert Howells]] and [[Eugene Aynsley Goossens|Eugene Goossens]] to write a piece each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=9.80004&amp;catNum=9.80004&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English Bliss: Colour Symphony]&lt;/ref&gt; Howells wrote ''Sine Nomine'' for wordless chorus,&lt;ref name=mwi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classRev/2003/Apr03/british_choral_music.htm|last=Culot|first=Hubert|title=Review: British Choral Music|publisher=MusicWeb International|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was not given its second performance until his centenary year 70 years later, in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simonlindley.org.uk/howells.html Romanticism in Retrospect]&lt;/ref&gt; Goossens wrote a piece called ''Silence'' for chorus and orchestra.&lt;ref name=mwi/&gt; Elgar's own contribution was his orchestration of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''Fantasia and Fugue in C minor''.

Bliss decided to write a symphony, but was at first undecided what the theme or character of the work would be. He could not get started for some weeks. One day, by chance, he came across a book on [[heraldry]] in which he read of the symbolic meanings attached to certain colours; this gave him the notion of writing a work about colours. He attempted to give each movement a character corresponding to these meanings, but without attempting to depict the colours themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emusic.com/lists/showlist.html?lid=16782048 The eMusic Dozen: British Composers]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bliss dedicated the symphony to the conductor [[Adrian Boult]].&lt;ref name=class/&gt;

The first performance, with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], in [[Gloucester Cathedral]] on 7 September 1922, was conducted by the composer.  It was not well received at first, due to poor preparation.  The work uses a large orchestra, but the platform was so taken up with the chorus required for other works also being performed, that several instruments had to be omitted.&lt;ref name=greene&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=m3S7PIxe0mwC&amp;pg=PA1199&amp;lpg=PA1199&amp;dq=bliss+colour+symphony+gloucester&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KT7QuTP2Va&amp;sig=7HENnXAqSA-G0UcegzQHMFAQ0Oc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VZ3RSb_iL6Xg6gPx_6yaBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Greene's Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers]&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar attended, but found it "disconcertingly modern".&lt;ref name=class&gt;[http://www.classicalarchives.com/work/92969.html#about Classical Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;  It nevertheless entered the repertoire and has been recorded various times, although it is now an infrequent visitor to concert platforms.

==Analysis==

The four movements are:

{| Class="wikitable" 
| style="background:purple"|{{fontcolor|white|'''Purple'''}}
| rowspan="2"|{{nowrap|'''''Andante maestoso'''''}}
| rowspan="2"|slow and majestic in pace and ceremonial in character
|-

|-
| style="background:red"|{{fontcolor|white|'''Red'''}}
| rowspan="2"| '''''Allegro vivace'''''
| rowspan="2"|a glittering, spiky and percussive scherzo, reminiscent of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/a-colour-symphony-for-orchestra-op-24-f-106 Answers.com: A Colour Symphony]&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| The colour of [[Emerald]]s, [[Hope]], [[Youth]], [[Joy]], [[Spring (season)|Spring]] and [[Victory]]'''
|-
|}

A theme from towards the end of the ''Red'' movement was used as the signature tune of the televised "[[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Serotsky|first=Paul|url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/Programme_Notes/bliss_colour.htm|title=Programme Notes: Bliss - A Colour Symphony|publisher=MusicWeb International|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revision==

In 1932, Bliss revised the [[coda (music)|coda]]s of the first two movements.&lt;ref name=Harvard/&gt;  He conducted the revised work himself in a recording with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Rec/rec.music.classical.recordings/2005-09/msg05493.html derkeiler.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Bliss made a stereo recording with the [[BBC Welsh Symphony Orchestra]].

The last movement, "Green", was separately published as ''Pyonepsion''.

==Other uses==
In 1977, a [[ballet]] called ''Royal Offering'' was created, with music based on ''A Colour Symphony''.

A short extract from the 'Red' movement was used as the opening music to [[BBC]] TV coverage of [[The Proms]] until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2010/about/questions.shtml BBC Proms 2010] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402173527/http://www.bbc.co.uk/proms/2010/about/questions.shtml |date=April 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British artist Kevin Laycock created a visual piece called ''Four Movements in Colour'', in which he attempted to portray, in colour, the sounds created by Arthur Bliss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drumcroon.org.uk/Arch1/klaycock/LaycockTeacherNotes.doc Four Movements in Colour: Recent Paintings by Kevin Laycock] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060930050504/http://www.drumcroon.org.uk/Arch1/klaycock/LaycockTeacherNotes.doc |date=September 30, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, Laycock created a series of paintings called ''Tectonics'' as a direct response to Bliss's ''A Colour Symphony'' using parallel compositional structures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colour-journal.org/2007/1/10/07110gallery.pdf Uncertain Harmonies]&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

"'''A Streetcar Named Marge'''" is the second episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 4)|fourth season]]. It first aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on October 1, 1992. In the episode, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] wins the role of [[Blanche DuBois]] in a [[community theatre]] [[musical theatre|musical]] version of [[Tennessee Williams]]' ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] offers little support for his wife's acting pursuits, and Marge begins to see parallels between him and [[Stanley Kowalski]], the play's boorish lead male character. The episode contains a [[subplot]] in which [[Maggie Simpson]] attempts to retrieve her [[pacifier]] from a strict [[day care|daycare]] owner.

[[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]] wrote the episode, and [[Rich Moore]] served as director. [[Jon Lovitz]] made his fourth guest appearance on ''The Simpsons'', this time as musical director [[Llewellyn Sinclair]], as well as Llewellyn's sister, who runs the daycare. The episode generated controversy for its original song about [[New Orleans]], which contains several unflattering lyrics about the city. One New Orleans newspaper published the lyrics before the episode aired, prompting numerous complaints to the local Fox affiliate; in response, the president of Fox Broadcasting issued an apology to anyone who was offended. Despite the controversial song, the episode was well received by many fans, and show creator [[Matt Groening]] has named it one of his favorite episodes.

==Plot==
While [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] and [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] are watching television, [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] announces that she is going to audition for a local musical production of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', and she wants to meet new people because she usually spends all day caring for [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. The rest of the family pay no attention and continue to watch television.

The musical, ''Oh, Streetcar!'', is directed by Llewellyn Sinclair. After [[Ned Flanders|Ned]] is cast as Stanley Kowalski, Marge auditions for Blanche DuBois. Llewellyn immediately rejects Marge, explaining that Blanche is supposed to be a "delicate flower being trampled by an uncouth lout". However, as a dejected Marge calls home and takes Homer's dinner order, Llewellyn realizes that she is perfect for the role.

The next day, Maggie causes distractions when Marge brings her to rehearsal, so Llewellyn tells Marge to enroll the baby at the daycare center, The [[Ayn Rand]] School for Tots, which is run by his sister Ms. Sinclair, who immediately confiscates Maggie's pacifier. Maggie and the other babies later engage in an attempt to retrieve their pacifiers, but Ms. Sinclair thwarts their efforts and sends Maggie to a [[playpen]].

During rehearsal, Marge struggles with a scene in which Blanche is supposed to break a glass bottle and attack Stanley, but she cannot muster enough anger towards Stanley to break the bottle. After coming home, Marge asks Homer to help her learn her lines, but Homer is uninterested. The day before the performance, Marge and Ned are again practising the bottle scene as Homer arrives to drive Marge home. Homer repeatedly interrupts the rehearsal. Imagining that Stanley is Homer, Marge finally smashes the bottle and lunges at Ned.

The next day at the daycare center, Maggie again attempts to regain her pacifier. With assistance from her fellow babies, following a complicated plan, she succeeds and wildly distributes pacifiers to all the small children. Homer retrieves her, and he and his children go to attend the musical. Homer immediately falls into boredom, but he perks up when Marge appears on stage. While Homer slowly learns the show's plot, he appears sad.  At the end of the musical, Marge receives a warm reaction from the crowd, but she misinterprets Homer's sadness for boredom. She confronts him with frustration and hostility, but Homer is able to explain that he was genuinely moved by the play. He feels for Blanche's situation, and he realizes Marge's feelings along with it. He expresses his intentions to be the husband that she deserves—someone to have in her life who loves her—not like Stanley who neglects and mistreats his wife. Marge realizes that Homer really did watch the musical, and the two happily leave the theater.{{sfn|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997|p=93}}&lt;ref name="officialsite"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==Production==
===Writing and music===
[[File:Jameslbrooks.jpg|thumb|upright|Producer [[James L. Brooks]] pitched the idea of Marge playing Blanche DuBois.]]
"A Streetcar Named Marge" was conceived about two years before it aired on television.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;Martin, Jeff. (2004). Commentary for "A Streetcar Named Marge", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Martin first pitched the idea of Homer being in a theatrical production of ''[[1776 (play)|1776]]''; producer [[James L. Brooks]] then suggested that Marge could play Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire''. Brooks saw that Marge's relationship with Homer was similar to Blanche's relationship with Stanley, and he wanted to use that fact to build the emotional arc for an episode. The estate of [[Tennessee Williams]] would not let the show use large excerpts from the actual play, since the work was copyrighted.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; However, Fox lawyer Anatole Klebanow said that original songs based on the play were acceptable. According to producer [[Mike Reiss]], Klebanow even promised to "take [their] case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] to get [the] episode aired."&lt;ref name="Reiss"&gt;Reiss, Mike. (2004). Commentary for "A Streetcar Named Marge", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin later explained that while the songs made the episode funnier, they also made it harder to write.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

The Maggie subplot was present in Martin's episode pitch.&lt;ref name="Jean"&gt;Jean, Al. (2004). Commentary for "A Streetcar Named Marge", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; The music in the sequence is [[Elmer Bernstein]]'s [[march (music)|march]] theme from ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]''. ''Simpsons'' composer [[Alf Clausen]] secured the rights to the score, along with the original orchestra charts. ''The Great Escape'' had been Martin's favorite film as a child, and he said "it was so exciting and so stirring" to hear the music being performed by the ''Simpsons''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; studio orchestra.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

===Animation===
"A Streetcar Named Marge" posed a challenge to the show's [[animation director]]s. The episode contains many long [[set piece]]s, especially during the third and final act, which includes the end of the Maggie subplot and the performance of the musical.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Several scenes required the animators to draw dozens of background characters.&lt;ref name="Groening"/&gt; [[Rich Moore]], the head director, initially feared the episode would not be completed in time.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]], the supervising director, also had doubts;&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; according to Martin, Moore sent back a cartoon of himself reading the script with his eyes popping out and his jaw dropped.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt; Producer [[Al Jean]] said that Moore "worked himself to death" to produce the episode's most elaborate sequences.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt;

A number of scenes that appeared in the [[storyboard]] and [[animatic]] were reordered or dropped altogether in the final version of the episode. Much of the Maggie subplot, for example, was modified before the episode aired. A scene in which the babies lock Ms. Sinclair in her office is missing from the final version of the episode.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;Moore, Rich. (2004). Commentary for "A Streetcar Named Marge", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voice acting===
All the main ''Simpsons'' [[List of The Simpsons cast members#Regular cast|cast members]] lent their voices to the episode, along with semi-regulars [[Maggie Roswell]] and [[Phil Hartman]]. Assistant producer [[Lona Williams]] also had a minor speaking role.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; 

Comedian [[Jon Lovitz]], who played Llewellyn Sinclair and Ms. Sinclair, made his fourth guest appearance on ''The Simpsons''; he had previously voiced characters in "[[The Way We Was]]", "[[Brush with Greatness]]", and "[[Homer Defined]]". Lovitz later worked with Al Jean and Mike Reiss in the animated sitcom ''[[The Critic]]'', and returned to ''The Simpsons'' for the episodes "[[A Star Is Burns]]", "[[Hurricane Neddy]]", "[[Half-Decent Proposal]]", "[[The Ziff Who Came to Dinner]]" and "[[Homerazzi]]". In 2006, Lovitz was named the eighth-best ''Simpsons'' guest star by [[IGN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/730/730566p4.html |title=Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances |accessdate=2007-03-25 |last1=Goldman |first1= Eric |last2=Iverson |first2= Dan  |last3=Zoromski |first3= Brian |date= January 4, 2010|publisher= IGN |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070306095518/http://tv.ign.com/articles/730/730566p4.html |archivedate=6 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
[[File:Simpsons Hitchcock.png|left|200px|thumb|Alfred Hitchcock walking his dogs, a reference to his [[List of Alfred Hitchcock cameo appearances|cameo]] in ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'']]
Though ''Oh, Streetcar!'' is based on ''A Streetcar Named Desire'', the title of the musical alludes to the theatrical [[revue]] ''[[Oh! Calcutta!]]''. Besides Blanche and Stanley, characters from ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' who appear in ''Oh, Streetcar!'' include Stella (played by [[Helen Lovejoy]]), the Young Collector (played by [[Apu Nahasapeemapetilon]]), Mitch (played by [[Lionel Hutz]]), the Doctor (played by [[Chief Wiggum]]), Steve (played by [[Jasper Beardley]], although Apu originally said he was playing Steve), and Pablo (originally played by [[Otto Mann]] but taken over by Llewellyn prior to curtain). The musical's closing song, "Kindness of Strangers", is a reference to Blanche's last line in the original play: "I have always depended on the kindness of strangers." However, the song is very cheery in tone, intentionally missing the point of Blanche's line, which is meant by the playwright Tennessee Williams to be ironic.&lt;ref name="Martin"/&gt;

The episode contains multiple references to [[Ayn Rand]]'s novels and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivist philosophy]]. Maggie's daycare center is called the "Ayn Rand School for Tots", and Ms. Sinclair can be seen reading a book called ''The Fountainhead Diet'', a reference to Rand's novel ''[[The Fountainhead]]''. On the wall of the daycare is a poster that reads "Helping is Futile", an allusion to Rand's rejection of the ethical doctrine of [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]]. Another wall sign reads "A is A", the [[law of identity]], which plays a central role in Rand's novel ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]''.{{sfn|Turner|2004|pp=64–65}} The Ayn Rand School for Tots is seen again in the 2012 [[short film]] "[[The Longest Daycare]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Snierson |first=Dan |title='The Simpsons': Exclusive details on the next big-screen adventure (it's short, silent, and in 3-D)! |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/05/22/the-simpsons-short-film/ |accessdate= 2012-07-05 |work= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maggie subplot uses the musical score of ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' and contains several other allusions to the film. At one point, Ms. Sinclair punishes Maggie by sending her to a playpen called "the box", a play on the solitary confinement facility called "the cooler" from the 1963 film. Maggie even bounces a ball against the wall of the playpen, as [[Steve McQueen]]'s character Virgil Hilts does throughout the film while he is in confinement.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

In the scene when Homer, Bart and Lisa pick up Maggie from the daycare center, babies are perched all over the building, staring at the family and quietly sucking on pacifiers. This is a spoof of the final shot of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]''. Indeed, a cartoon-version of Hitchcock can be seen walking his dogs past the daycare, a reference to his own [[List of Hitchcock cameo appearances|cameo appearance]] in the film.&lt;ref name="Reiss"/&gt; The episode also contains an allusion to the opera scene in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', in which Homer plays with a shredded playbill while he watches his wife in the musical.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Merchandise==
All the songs from "A Streetcar Named Marge" were released on [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]]' 2000 album ''[[Songs in the Key of Springfield]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Songs in the Key of Springfield |date=1997-03-27 |page=F4 |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |author =Kloer, Phil}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was included in the 2005 [[VHS]] set ''The Simpsons Go Hollywood''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Home Video |date=2000-01-14 |page=51 |work=[[The Star-Ledger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Another Homer for the Simpsons |date=2000-01-14 |page=11J |work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] |author =Maurstad, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released on [[DVD]] in 2004 as part of [[The Simpsons (season 4)#DVD release|''The Simpsons Complete Fourth Season'']].

==Reception==
[[File:Matt_Groening_by_Gage_Skidmore_2.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] includes the episode among his favorites.]]
In its original broadcast, "A Streetcar Named Marge" finished 32nd in ratings for the week of September 27&amp;nbsp;– October 4, 1992, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 11.8, equivalent to approximately 11.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following ''[[Married... with Children]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New romantic comedies give CBS boost |work=Sun-Sentinel |author =Hastings, Deborah |page=6E |date=October 9, 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since airing, it has received many positive reviews from fans and television critics.

In 1993, "A Streetcar Named Marge" and "[[Mr. Plow]]" were submitted for the [[Primetime Emmy Award]] for "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series|Outstanding Comedy Series]]". Before this season, the series had only been allowed to compete in the "[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming less than One Hour)|Outstanding Animated Program]]" category, winning twice, but in early 1993 the rules were changed so that animated television shows would be able to submit nominations for "Outstanding Comedy Series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=`Simpsons' get Emmy 's respect&amp;nbsp;— Academy lets series drop cartoon status to compete as sitcom |date=1993-02-02 |page=B4 |work=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |author =Holloway, Diane}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Emmy voters were hesitant to pit cartoons against live action programs, and ''The Simpsons'' did not receive a nomination. The ''Simpsons''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; crew submitted episodes for Outstanding Comedy Series the next season, but again these were not nominated.&lt;ref name="Mr. Plow"&gt;{{cite video |people=Jean, Al |year=2004 |title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode "[[Mr. Plow]]" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the show has submitted episodes in the animation category and has won seven times.&lt;ref name="Emmy"&gt;[http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php Emmy Awards official site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014192522/http://www.emmys.org/awards/awardsearch.php |date=October 14, 2008 }} "The Simpsons" ''emmys.org''.

===Controversy===
[[File:Jeff Martin.jpg|alt=Martin smiling|thumb|Writer Jeff Martin (pictured here in 1994) received criticism for satirizing New Orleans]]
The musical within the episode contains a controversial song about New Orleans, which describes the city as a "home of pirates, drunks and whores", among other things. Jeff Martin, the writer of the episode, had meant the song to be a parody of a song in ''[[Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street|Sweeney Todd]]'', which speaks of London in unflattering terms ("There's No Place Like London").&lt;ref name="Martin2"&gt;Martin, Jeff (2004). "The Cajun Controversy", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; Al Jean later explained that two [[Cajun]] characters were supposed to walk out of the theater in disgust, but none of the voice actors could provide a convincing Cajun accent.&lt;ref name=Lorando&gt;{{cite news |title='Simpsons' takes a shot at Crescent City |date=1992-10-01 |page=A1 |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |author =Lorando, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early version of the scene can be seen in an animatic included in the DVD boxset.&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;Moore, Rich. (2004). Animatic for the episode "A Streetcar Named Marge", in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the premiere of the fourth season, the producers sent two episodes to critics: "[[Kamp Krusty]]" and "A Streetcar Named Marge".&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; A New Orleans critic viewed "A Streetcar Named Marge" and published the song lyrics in his newspaper before the episode aired.&lt;ref name=Lorando/&gt; Many readers took the lyrics out of context, and New Orleans' then-Fox affiliate, [[WNOL-TV]] (then-owned by musician [[Quincy Jones]]; the Fox affiliation for the area later moved to [[WVUE-DT|WVUE]]), received about one hundred complaints on the day the episode aired. Several local radio stations also held on-air protests in response to the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fox apologizes for 'Simpsons' |date=1992-10-02 |page=B1 |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |author =Lorando, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the urging of WNOL, Fox president [[Jamie Kellner]] released a statement on October 1, 1992:

{{cquote|It has come to our attention that a comedic song about New Orleans in tonight's episode of "The Simpsons" has offended some city residents and officials. Viewers who watch the episode will realize that the song is in fact a parody of the opening numbers of countless Broadway musicals, which are designed to set the stage for the story that follows. That is the only purpose of this song. We regret that the song, taken out of context, has caused offense. This was certainly not the intention of "The Simpsons" production staff or Fox Broadcasting Company.&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;"The Cajun Controversy" (2004), in ''The Simpsons: The Complete Fourth Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Simpsons''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; producers rushed out a [[chalkboard gag]] for "[[Homer the Heretic]]", which aired a week after "A Streetcar Named Marge". It read, "I will not defame New Orleans." The gag was their attempt to apologize for the song and hopefully bring the controversy to an end.&lt;ref name="Martin2"/&gt; "We didn't realize people would get so mad", said Al Jean. "It was the best apology we could come up with in eight words or less."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bart chalks up apology for New Orleans song |date=1992-10-08 |page=A1 |work=[[The Times-Picayune]] |author =Lorando, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue passed quickly, and a person in a Bart Simpson costume even served as [[Krewe of Tucks]] Grand Marshal at the 1993 [[New Orleans Mardi Gras]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=For Silver Celebration, Tucks 'Lov-A-Da Music |date=1993-02-21 |page=D7 |work=[[The Times-Picayune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode generated further controversy in September 2005, when [[Channel 4]] in the United Kingdom decided to air the episode a week after [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck New Orleans. Arguing that the episode was an insensitive choice, given recent events, several viewers filed complaints with [[Ofcom]]. Two days later, Channel 4 apologized on-air and directly contacted all those who had complained. Channel 4 had screened the episode for offensive content, but the reviews focused on the main content of the episode, and the song was not considered a key part of the plot. Channel 4 promised to update their review process to ensure that similar incidents would not occur.&lt;ref name="Ofcom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/pcb49/#skip |title=Issue number 46 |accessdate=2007-08-24 |year=2005 |publisher=Ofcom |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813150912/http://www.ofcom.org.uk/tv/obb/prog_cb/pcb49/ |archivedate=13 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''album-equivalent unit''' is a measurement unit in [[music industry]] to define the consumption of music that equals the purchase of one [[album]] copy.&lt;ref name="pitchfork"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BillboardRule"/&gt; This consumption includes [[streaming media|streaming]] and [[music download|song downloads]] in addition to traditional [[album sales]]. The album-equivalent unit was introduced in the mid-[[2010s]] as an answer to the drop of album sales in the 21st century. Album sales more than halved from 1999 to 2009, declining from a $14.6 to $6.3 billion industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Album Sales Are Down|url=http://www.speeli.com/articles/view/Why-album-sales-are-down|website=Speeli|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the only albums that [[Music_recording_certification|went platinum]] in the United States in 2014 were the ''[[Frozen (soundtrack)|Frozen]]'' soundtrack and [[Taylor Swift]]'s [[1989 (Taylor Swift album)|''1989'']], whereas several artists did in 2013.&lt;ref name="noplat"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2014/10/16/not-one-artists-album-has-gone-platinum-in-2014/ |title=Not One Artist's Album Has Gone Platinum In 2014 |last=McIntyre |first=Hugh |date=October 16, 2014 |work=[[Forbes]] |publisher=Forbes, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Sam|title=Taylor Swift, Platinum Party of One|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2014/11/05/361577726/taylor-swift-platinum-party-of-one|website=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the album-equivalent units revolutionized the charts from the "best-selling albums" ranking into the "most popular albums" ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7393605/drakes-views-no-1-fifth-week-billboard-200|title=Drake's 'Views' Rules at No. 1 for Fifth Week on Billboard 200 Chart|first=Keith|last=Caulfield|work=Billboard|date=May 22, 2016|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) have used album-equivalent unit to measure their [[Global Recording Artist of the Year]] since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.org/global-artist-chart.php|title=Global Recording Artist of the Year|publisher=[[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses on record charts==
=== United States ===
Beginning with the December 13, 2014 issue, the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart revised its ranking methodology with album-equivalent unit instead of pure album sales. With this overhaul, the ''Billboard'' 200 includes on-demand streaming and digital track sales (as measured by [[Nielsen SoundScan]]) by way of a new algorithm, utilizing data from all of the major on-demand audio subscription services including [[Spotify]], [[Apple Music]], [[Google Play]] and [[Xbox Music]]. Known as TEA (track equivalent album) and SEA (streaming equivalent album) when originally implemented, 10 song sales or 1,500 song streams from an album were treated as equivalent to one purchase of the album. ''Billboard'' continues to publish a pure album sales chart, called [[Top Album Sales]], that maintains the traditional ''Billboard'' 200 methodology, based exclusively on Nielsen SoundScan's sales data.&lt;ref name="BillboardRule"&gt;{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Trust|title=Billboard 200 Makeover: Album Chart to Incorporate Streams &amp; Track Sales|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6320099/billboard-200-makeover-streams-digital-tracks|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=2014-11-20|accessdate=2014-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taylor Swift's ''1989'' was the first album to top the chart with this methodology, generating 339,000 album-equivalent units (281,000 units came from pure album sales).&lt;ref name="pitchfork"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6334866/taylor-swift-1989-returns-no-1-billboard-200 |title=Taylor Swift's '1989' Returns to No. 1 on Revamped Billboard 200|work=billboard.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/589-why-is-taylor-swift-still-1-interpreting-the-revamped-billboard-200-album-chart/ |title=Why Is Taylor Swift Still #1?|work=pitchfork.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the February 8, 2015 issue, ''[[Now That's What I Call Music! 53 (U.S. series)|Now That's What I Call Music! 53]]'' became the first album in history to miss the top position of the ''Billboard'' 200 despite being the best-selling album of the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/28306/20150212/now-53-outsells-taylor-swift-becomes-first-record-top-albums-kid-ink.htm|title=Now 53 Outsells Taylor Swift, Becomes First Record to Top Albums Chart but Not Billboard 200; Kid Ink Cracks Top 10|first=Ryan|last=Book|date=February 12, 2015|work=The Music Times|accessdate=July 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In July 2018, Billboard and Nielsen revised the ratios used for streaming equivalent album units to account for the relative value of streams on paid music services like Apple Music or Amazon Music Unlimited versus ad-supported music and video platforms such as Spotify's free tier and YouTube. Under the updated album equivalent ratios, 1,250 premium audio streams, 3,750 ad-supported streams, or 3,750 video streams are equal to one album unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/arts/music/drake-scorpion-streams-billboard-chart.html|title=The Music Industry’s Math Changes, but the Outcome Doesn’t: Drake Is No. 1|first=Ben|last=Sisario|date=July 9, 2018|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, the [[Official Charts Company]] has included streaming into the [[UK Albums Chart]] since March 2015.&lt;ref name="Sam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6487512/sam-smiths-in-the-lonely-hour-tops-historic-uk-albums-chart |title=Sam Smith's 'In the Lonely Hour' Tops Historic U.K. Albums Chart|work=billboard.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change was decided after the massive growth of streaming; the number of tracks streamed in the UK in a year doubled from 7.5 billion in 2013 to just under 15 billion in 2014. Under the new methodology, Official Charts Company takes the 12 most-streamed tracks from an album, with the top two songs being given lesser weight so that the figure will reflect the popularity of the album as a whole rather than of one or two successful [[single (music)|singles]]. The adjusted total is divided by 1000 and added to the album sales figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/uk-s-official-albums-chart-to-include-streaming-data-for-first-time__8012/ |title=Official Albums Chart to include streaming data for first time|work=officialcharts.com|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Smith (singer)|Sam Smith]]'s ''[[In the Lonely Hour]]'' was the first album to top the chart with this rule. Out of its 41,000 album-equivalent units, 2,900 units came from streaming and the rest were pure sales.&lt;ref name="Sam"/&gt; By the end of 2017, The BPI reported that streaming now accounts for over half of music consumption in the UK (50.4%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/drakes-official-top-40-most-streamed-songs__21625/|title=Drake's Official Top 40 most streamed songs|access-date=2018-01-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Germany ===
In Germany, streaming began to be included on the albums chart since February 2016. Nevertheless, [[German Albums Chart]] is used to ranking the albums based on weekly [[revenue]], instead of units. Hence, only paid streaming is counted and should be played at least 30 seconds. At least 6 tracks of one album have to be streamed to make streams count for the album, with 12 tracks being the maximum counted. Similar to the UK chart rule, the actual streams of the top-two songs are not counted, but instead the average of the following tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musikmarkt.de/Aktuell/News/Deutsche-Album-Charts-integrieren-Premium-Streaming|archive-url=https://archive.is/20160201142531/http://www.musikmarkt.de/Aktuell/News/Deutsche-Album-Charts-integrieren-Premium-Streaming|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 1, 2016|publisher=Musikmarkt.de|language=German|title=Deutsche Album-Charts integrieren Premium-Streaming|date=February 1, 2016|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Deutsche-Album-Charts-jetzt-auch-mit-Streaming-Zahlen-3089360.html|title=Deutsche Album-Charts jetzt auch mit Streaming-Zahlen|first=Volker|last=Briegleb|date=February 1, 2016|publisher=[[Heinz Heise]]|accessdate=1 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes.com]], Hugh McIntyre noted that the usage of album equivalent units has made artists release albums with excessive track lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2017/08/17/how-longer-albums-and-streaming-giants-are-manipulating-the-charts/2/#69d2965051b3|title=How Longer Albums And Streaming Giants Are Manipulating The Charts|publisher=Forbes|date=2017-08-17|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Josephs from ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' said: "If you’re a thirsty pop artist of note, you can theoretically game the system by packing as many as 20 tracks into an album, in the process rolling up more album-equivalent units—and thus album "sales"—as listeners check the album out." He also criticized [[Chris Brown]]'s album ''[[Heartbreak on a Full Moon]]'' which contains over 40 songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/05/chris-brown-new-album-40-song-tracklist-heartbreak-on-a-full-moon/|title=Why Does Chris Brown’s New Album Have 40 Songs?|date=2017-05-02|publisher=Spin|accessdate=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3602">In the context of [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) collaborations, '''background, foreground, sideground and postground intellectual property''' (IP) are four distinct forms of [[intellectual property]] assets. These are included in the broader and more general categories of knowledge in R&amp;D collaborations or [[open innovation]]. While background and foreground IP and knowledge are fairly established concepts, sideground and postground IP and knowledge have more recently been added to the conceptual vocabulary. This set of four concepts was first introduced by Prof. Ove Granstrand in a European Commission report in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Ove Granstrand|author-link= |authors= |date=2001 |title=IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) Aspects of Internet Collaborations |url=http://bookshop.europa.eu/nl/workshop-report-on-ipr-intellectual-property-rights-aspects-of-pbKI3601855/downloads/KI-36-01-855-EN-C/KI3601855ENC_001.pdf;pgid=y8dIS7GUWMdSR0EAlMEUUsWb0000DlRJYbDw;sid=Yr4L-CxbP5AL9H7qxKuVX05-L90ViiuIZG0=?FileName=KI3601855ENC_001.pdf&amp;SKU=KI3601855ENC_PDF&amp;CatalogueNumber=KI-36-01-855-EN-C |publisher=European Commission |page= |docket= |access-date=16 February 2017 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four knowledge/IP types are defined by Granstrand and Holgersson (2014):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Granstrand |first=Ove |last2=Holgersson |first2=Marcus |date=2014 |title=The challenge of closing open innovation: The intellectual property disassembly problem |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.5437/08956308X5705258 |journal=Research-Technology Management |volume=57 |issue=5 |pages=19–25 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Background knowledge/IP is knowledge/IP that is relevant to a collaborative venture or open innovation project that is supplied by the partners '''at the start of the project'''.
*Foreground knowledge/IP is all the knowledge/IP produced within the collaborative venture or  open innovation project '''during the project'''’s tenure.
*Sideground knowledge/IP is knowledge/IP that is relevant to a collaborative venture or open innovation project, but produced '''outside the project''' by any of the partners '''during the project'''’s tenure.
*Postground knowledge/IP is knowledge/IP that is relevant to a collaborative venture or open innovation project that is produced by any of the partners '''after the project''' ends.

[[File:Massachusetts State House Red Sox Banner.JPG|thumb|The [[Massachusetts State House]] displays a Boston Strong banner during the [[2013 World Series]].]]
"'''Boston Strong'''" is a slogan that was created as part of the reaction to the [[Boston Marathon bombing]] in April 2013. It is a variation on the term [[Livestrong]], which was created in 2004. It has been placed on various kinds of merchandise after the phrase became popular, as well as gained criticism from various entities.&lt;ref name=Zimmer&gt;{{cite news|last=Zimmer|first=Ben|title="Boston Strong," the phrase that rallied a city|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2013/05/11/boston-strong-phrase-that-rallied-city/uNPFaI8Mv4QxsWqpjXBOQO/story.html|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=12 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of the term in Boston has led to similar phrases entering public discourse, such as America Strong.

==History==
In the hours after the [[Boston Marathon bombing]] on April 15, 2013, the slogan "Boston Strong" appeared as a highly popular hashtag on [[Twitter]] and rapidly spread around the world. It was a [[T-shirt]] campaign created by Christopher Dobens and Nicholas Reynolds, students at [[Emerson College]].  An expression of [[Boston]]'s unity after the bombings, the slogan showed up on T-shirts and other products, and was emblazoned on the "Green Monster" wall at Boston's [[Fenway Park]].&lt;ref name=NBCNewsApril21&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/21/17850375-boston-strong-emerges-as-rallying-cry-from-stadiums-to-tweets |title='Boston Strong' emerges as rallying cry, from stadiums to tweets |publisher=NBC News |date=April 21, 2013 |first=Lou |last=Dubois}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dicker/&gt; The [[Boston Bruins]] displayed the slogan on their helmets at their game two days after the bombings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prohockeytalk.nbcsports.com/2013/04/17/video-bruins-honor-victims-first-responders-of-boston-marathon-tragedy/ |title=Bruins honor victims, first responders of Boston Marathon tragedy |first=Mike |last=Halford |date=April 17, 2013 |publisher=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the first [[baseball]] game in Fenway Park after the bombings, the stadium announcer told the crowd: "We are one. We are strong. We are Boston. We are Boston strong."&lt;ref name=NBCNewsApril21/&gt;

On April 17, two days after the bombings, a T-shirt vendor and another private individual submitted separate [[trademark]] registration applications to the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]], seeking to obtain ownership of the "Boston Strong" slogan for use on commercial products.&lt;ref name=Dicker/&gt; One of the applicants said he wanted the trademark in order to prevent people from outside the Boston area from benefiting from it. A [[trademark attorney]] was quoted in ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' as predicting that the government office would deny the registration on the grounds that the slogan was already in the public domain and could not be linked to any specific entity.&lt;ref name=Dicker&gt;{{cite news|last=Dicker|first=Rick|title=Boston Strong' Trademark Race Begins; Two File Just Days After Boston Marathon Bombing|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/22/boston-strong-trademark_n_3131857.html|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 17, 2013, Boston Strong Bostonstrong.com LLC submitted [[trademark]] application to the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]], the first for "Charitable Fundraising to Support Disaster Relief", and failed to receive registration in April 2014. Boston Strong bostonstrong.com was created 11/29/2012, well before anyone was interested in the mark, and was used as a man-made and natural disaster safety awareness advertising and disaster news campaign created by a North East and New England documentary news journalist reporting on the Appalachian Thrust and Lower Atlantic Region. VTstrong.com "Don't Drive into Water" campaign began in 2011 when Hurricane Irene's five-inch rain  caused historic downhill water rapids and valley flooding that devastated Vermont. The goods manufactured by the micro–small business inventor sold via bostonstrong.com to create Boston Strong Disaster Relief, Inc., bostonstrong.org, a MA non-profit, on March 17, 2015. The non-profit is an IRS 501c3 approved charity and is administrating the MassDOT MA State Boston Strong license plate. Boston Strong Disaster Relief, Inc. is a registered service mark trademark in the State of MA as of 4/13/2015. The organization is 100% volunteer and benefits Boston bombing survivors' long term medical needs not covered by insurance.

The One Fund Boston, a trademark that received registration, collected and distributed over $80 million, is closed in 2015.

In late May, a concert, Boston Strong: An Evening of Support and Celebration, was held at [[TD Garden]] with performances by [[Aerosmith]], [[James Taylor]], [[Bell Biv Devoe]], [[New Kids on the Block]] [[J. Geils Band]], [[Boston (band)|Boston]], [[Godsmack]], [[Extreme (band)|Extreme]], [[Jason Aldean]], [[Jimmy Buffett]], [[Carole King]], [[Dane Cook]] and [[Steven Wright]].&lt;ref name=WCVB&gt;{{cite news|title=Boston Marathon concert to feature music icons Aerosmith, James Taylor, NKOTB concert benefits One Fund|url=http://www.wcvb.com/entertainment/boston-marathon-concert-to-feature-music-icons/20314190#ixzz2vbBOd3YT|accessdate=10 March 2014|newspaper=[[WCVB]]|date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boston Strong entertainment industry concert videos online and money they generate is not associated with the bostonstrong.org charity. 

The term has also made its way into many publications since the bombings, as well.&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Judith|title=Boston Strong—In Books|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/61330-boston-strong-in-books.html|publisher=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=10 March 2014|date=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The roots of Boston Strong can be traced back to the Livestrong bracelets marketed by the [[Livestrong Foundation]] in 2003. The phrase can also be traced back to the [[United States Army]]'s Army Strong motto, as well as Jersey Strong (Work Out World gym), which became popular in [[New Jersey]] following the destruction of [[Hurricane Sandy]].&lt;ref name=Zimmer /&gt;
Man-Made and Natural disaster non-entertainment news affiliates Boston Strong bostonstrong.com was created 11/29/2012, 15 months after affiliate VTstrong.com was created in 2011 following Hurricane Irene mountain floods. NewJerseyStrong.com was created 10/2012 as Hurricane Sandy struck the lower Atlantic.

==Criticism==
[[Wesley Lowery]], then a reporter at ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', tweeted in October 2013 that he thought the phrase had become overly commercialized, a view which drew criticism though Lowery's tweet specified he was "still inspired by the resilience of so many of those wounded in the marathon bombings."&lt;ref name=Klonoski&gt;{{cite news|last=Klonoski|first=Brian|title=Boston Globe Reporter Wesley Lowery Is 'So Tired of Boston Strong'|url=http://www.ryot.org/boston-globe-reporter-wesley-lowery-tired-boston-strong/443245|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=RYOT|date=26 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027081456/http://www.ryot.org/boston-globe-reporter-wesley-lowery-tired-boston-strong/443245#|archive-date=2013-10-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.boston.com/blogs/news/local/chartgirl/2013/10/_view_the_story_thou.html|title=Thou shall not tweet anything negative about "Boston Strong"|last=Sargent|first=Hillary|date=October 25, 2013|work=Boston.com|access-date=September 13, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, [[Bill Maher]] criticized the term, referring to a moment when he said: "You know again it was a bad day. Three people died that's terrible, more were maimed that's horrible, but unfortunately that happens every day in car accidents and everything else. I mean your city was not leveled by [[Godzilla]]." The remarks came in response to the [[2013 World Series]] celebration, when [[Boston Red Sox]] players [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]] and [[Jonny Gomes]] walked to the finish line of the [[Boston Marathon]] and placed the World Series Trophy on the line, while the crowd sang "[[God Bless America]]". Former Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] later called Maher's comments "irresponsible."&lt;ref name=WBZ&gt;{{cite news|title=Menino Says Bill Maher's Boston Bombing Comments Were "Irresponsible"|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2013/11/14/menino-calls-bill-mahers-boston-bombing-comments-irresponsible/|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=[[WBZ-TV|WBZ]]|date=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, a charitable organization in [[El Paso, Texas]] considered taking possible legal action against the Red Sox due to their using a variation of the slogan, "B Strong", which it started using seven years earlier.&lt;ref name=WBZ3&gt;{{cite news|title=Report: Red Sox May Be Sued By Charitable Foundation Over Use Of 'B Strong' Logo|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2014/02/28/report-red-sox-may-be-sued-by-charitable-foundation-over-use-of-b-strong-logo/|accessdate=3 March 2014|newspaper=WBZ|date=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This secondary sense is more precisely and commonly expressed with the term [[enunciation]], or with its synonym [[Manner of articulation|articulation]].&lt;ref name="Crannell97p84"&gt;Crannell (1997) Part II, Speech, p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

Diction has multiple concerns, of which [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] is foremost—another way of saying this is whether words are either [[formality|formal]] or [[colloquialism|informal]] in the social context. Literary diction analysis reveals how a passage establishes [[setting tone|tone]] and characterization, e.g. a preponderance of verbs relating physical movement suggests an active character, while a preponderance of verbs relating states of mind portrays an introspective character. Diction also has an impact upon word choice and syntax.

[[Aristotle]], in [[Poetics (Aristotle)|The Poetics]] (20) states that "Diction comprises eight elements: [[Phoneme]], [[Syllable]], [[Grammatical conjunction|Conjunction]], [[Logical connective|Connective]], [[Noun]], [[Verb]], [[Inflection]], and [[Utterance]]. However, Epps states&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that in this passage "the text is so confused and some of the words have such a variety of meanings that one cannot always be certain what the Greek says, much less what Aristotle means."

==In literature==
Diction is usually judged with reference to the prevailing standards of proper writing and speech and is seen as the mark of quality of the writing. It is also understood as the selection of certain words or phrases that become peculiar to a writer.

;Example : Certain writers in the modern day and age use archaic terms such as "thy", "thee", and "wherefore" to imbue a Shakespearean mood to their work.

Forms of diction include: Archaic Diction (diction that is antique, that is rarely used), High Diction (lofty sounding language), and Low Diction (everyday language). Each of these forms are to enhance the meaning or artistry of an author's work.

==Plot introduction==
Fancy Nancy is a young girl with a larger than life personality, who adores all things fancy.  She always dresses extravagantly, wearing [[Feather boa|boas]], [[Ballet tutu|tutus]], [[ruby slippers]], fairy wings, and fuzzy slippers.  Nancy loves using big fancy words such as "iridescent", "ecstatic", and "extraordinary" and anything in French.&lt;ref name="OCReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HC-Berkowitz"&gt;{{Cite news|title=BOOKS – Don't forget your tiara: It's a "Fancy" soiree – Celebration toasts author and illustrator |last=Berkowitz|first=Lana|date=March 27, 2007|publisher=Houston Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has redecorated her bedroom with everyday items, such as feather boas, Christmas lights, paper flowers, and hats. Her favorite doll is named Marabelle Lavinia Chandelier.&lt;ref name="NYTReview"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Jenkins| first = Emily| author2 = | title ='Fancy Nancy,' by Jane O'Connor.

In Nancy's opinion, her family is ordinary and dresses rather plainly, so Nancy decides to hold a class in the art of fanciness for her family. They oblige, and Nancy helps to dress them in bows, ornaments, top hats, and gaudy scarves. "Ooo-la-la!" Nancy cries in delight. "My family is posh! That's a fancy word for fancy."&lt;ref name="NYTReview"/&gt;

==Jane O'Connor==
Jane O'Connor is vice-president and editor-at-large for Penguin Books for Young Readers!&lt;ref name="Sparkles"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lodge | first = Sally| title = From Sparkles to Sales, Nancy Is Fancy Indeed | publisher = [[Publishers Weekly]]| date = January 31, 2007| url = http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-book-news/article/16091-from-sparkles-to-sales-nancy-is-fancy-indeed.html |accessdate = January 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written more than thirty children's books.  Her first adult novel, ''Dangerous Admissions: Secrets of a Closet Sleuth'' came out in July 2007.&lt;ref name="Sparkles"/&gt;

O'Connor came up with Fancy Nancy on a summer evening.  As she describes it, "It was after dinner one evening that the title just came to me," she recalls. "I sat down and wrote the first and last paragraphs. The rest of the story took me awhile, but the beginning and the end just flew into my head."&lt;ref name="Playthings"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sparkles"/&gt;  O'Connor is quick to point out that much of the book's success is Glasser's artwork.  She wrote the book in 2002, but it did not come out until 2005, because her editor, Margaret Anastas, insisted on Glasser as the illustrator who was busy with other projects.&lt;ref name="HC-Berkowitz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sparkles"/&gt;

==Robin Preiss Glasser==
{{main article|Robin Preiss Glasser}}

In 2013 Glasser was named 2013 Illustrator of the Year by the Children's Book Council for ''Fancy Nancy and the Mermaid Ballet'' after more than 1 million young people cast their votes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbcbooks.org/sub-news.php?id=1005 |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808192138/http://www.cbcbooks.org/sub-news.php?id=1005#.UcCSU1oo6bg |archive-date=August 8, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 6th annual Children's Choice Book Awards.

==Marketing==
''Fancy Nancy'' has spawned a line of toys and games focusing on dress-up and role play targeted towards preschoolers and children aged 5 to 7.  In addition, the Fancy Nancy brand includes licenses for clothing, paper party goods, crafts, and more. Numerous bookstores and libraries around the United States have hosted events including readings by both Jane O'Connor and Robin Preiss Glasser, costume contests, “Fancy Nancy” days and tea parties.&lt;ref name="Playthings"/&gt;

A Fancy Nancy game called ''Fancy Nancy: Tea Party Time!'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] systems was released on September 14, 2010.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The '''''Feast of Herod with the Beheading of St John the Baptist''''' is an extremely large painting by the  German-[[Silesia]]n artist [[Bartholomeus Strobel]] the Younger (1591 &amp;ndash; about 1650) which is now displayed in the [[Museo del Prado]] in [[Madrid]].  In oils on canvas, it measures 2.80 x 9.52 metres, and is variously dated between about 1630 and 1643.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Guide, 409; Harosimowicz; variant titles include:  "The Beheading of St John the Baptist", "Herod's Feast" (see Fresco), "The Banquet of Herod and the Decapitation of John the Baptist" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=I2tCAjijsKQC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90] etc. The Prado's Spanish title is ''' ''La Degollación de San Juan Bautista y el banquete de Herodes''''' and their English one (in the Prado Guide) is '''''The Beheading of St John the Baptist and the Banquet of Herod'''''&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows two scenes from the biblical account of the death of [[John the Baptist]].  The main part of the painting, on the left, shows the banquet of [[Herod Antipas]] at which his daughter [[Salome]] produced the head of John the Baptist.  The much smaller execution scene is shown on the right hand side, to the right of the column dividing the picture space.&lt;ref&gt;Ossowski, 13&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Beheading of John the Baptist]] had often been  combined with the [[Feast of Herod (disambiguation)|Feast of Herod]] in this way, with the execution relegated to a different space at the side of the image, a pattern Strobel takes to an extreme.

The figures include many portraits of leading figures of the [[Thirty Years' War]], and probably other less well known court figures, not all so far identified, or with agreed identifications.  It has been interpreted as an [[allegory|allegorical]] "appeal to the Christian world to save [Strobel's] doomed home country" of Silesia, which had suffered greatly from the wars.&lt;ref name="Harosimowicz"&gt;Harosimowicz&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Strobel-bautista.jpg|thumb|850px|''Feast of Herod with the Beheading of St John the Baptist'', [[Prado]], almost 10 metres wide, this enormous work is probably the masterpiece of Bartholomeus Strobel the Younger]]

==Allegory of Europe==
[[File:Strobel-bautista crop left.jpg|left|thumb|The military group at the left]]
The painting includes many portraits of leading political and military figures from around Europe, relying on prints for the likenesses of those not known to Strobel. It is probably central to the allegory that the coat of arms of Strobel's home city, now [[Wrocław]], Poland, which he would have known by its German name of Breslau, includes the image of the head of John the Baptist on a platter. Strobel was forced to leave Breslau by the Thirty Years' War in 1634, finally settling in Poland. Only Herod himself, dressed in oriental costume, reacts strongly to the head produced at the dining table; the other figures seem unconcerned, which may be the point of the allegory.&lt;ref&gt;Harosimowicz; Ossowski, 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

Identifications of the figures shown vary.&lt;ref&gt;Ossowski, 14–15; he avoids endorsing any identifications&lt;/ref&gt; One set, predicated on a date in the early 1640s for the work, is as follows: the figure holding a trumpet at the centre, looking out at the viewer, is the Dutch [[Admiral Tromp]], whose victory at the [[Battle of the Downs]] in 1639 had decisively ended Spanish naval power. To his left [[Henry IV of France]] (who had died in 1610) pulls at a cloth over a table laid with fruit (so presenting "the fruits of victory").  The group of men standing in the foreground on the left are the Imperial generalissimo [[Albrecht von Wallenstein|Wallenstein]], with the long staff, with behind him his subordinate generals Count [[Vilém Kinský]], Christian Freiherr von Ilow and Count Adam Erdmann Trcka von Lipa as well as one of their assassins in 1634, the Irish colonel of [[dragoon]]s [[Walter Butler of Roscrea]].&lt;ref name="Harosimowicz" /&gt;

Among the diners at the table are [[John George I, Elector of Saxony]], [[Charles I of England]], the [[Infanta]] and from 1637 Empress [[Maria Anna of Spain]] (wife of [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor]]), [[Marie de' Medici]], [[Dowager]] Queen of France, her favourite [[Concino Concini]] (d. 1617), [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] ([[favourite]] of Charles I until assassinated in 1637), and [[Marie de Rohan]], duchesse de Chevreuse.&lt;ref name="Harosimowicz" /&gt;
[[File:Strobel-bautista crop ladies.jpg|thumb|Herod and the group of ladies]]

The head of John the Baptist on the platter has the features of Duke [[John Christian of Brieg]] (d. 1639), the staunch [[Calvinist]] champion of Silesian Protestantism.  Salome holds the plate, and since her elaborate dress still leaves her implausibly high breasts completely uncovered, she is unlikely to be a portrait of an important figure.&lt;ref name="Harosimowicz" /&gt;

To the right of Herod, the group of ladies includes: [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia]], Queen [[Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg]], widow of [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] (died 1632), with her daughter [[Christina, Queen of Sweden]] (only born in 1626) and sister [[Catherine of Brandenburg]], briefly ruler of [[Transylvania]] after her husband [[Gabriel Bethlen]], King of Hungary, died in 1629.  The boy with the torch in the foreground may be the exiled [[Charles I Louis, Elector Palatine]] (born 1617, son of Elizabeth Stuart), who inherited in 1632, and the somewhat lion-like dog in a sitting-up posture may be an illusion to the lions in the arms of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] as well as those of the [[Dutch Republic]].  The lady in the large turban in the row behind may be [[Amalia of Solms-Braunfels]], wife of [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange]], the Dutch [[stadtholder]], who gave the Palatine family refuge in exile.&lt;ref name="Harosimowicz" /&gt;

Alternative identifications find a portrait of [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor]], and identify the features of John the Baptist as those of Charles I of England, although he was not beheaded until 1649, which is probably well after Strobel painted the work.&lt;ref&gt;Prado Catalogo, 377&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:Strobel-bautista crop table.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of the left end of the table. The depiction of the standing figures at front varies, and the two boys wear Polish styles of costume.]]
The style of the figures in the Prado painting varies between realistic portraiture, generalized and idealized faces, especially among the females, and expressive caricature, with the three types often mixed in a single group.  The costumes of many figures are painted in great detail and with precision, but the fashions shown vary from French styles of the 1630s to those of Poland, with some purely fanciful elements.  The two boys with candles in front of the left end of the table wear Polish styles, from the distinctive ''szkofia'' three-plumed hat badge of the right-hand one (held at his waist) to the boots of the one at left, who looks to be a portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Ossowski, 13–14, 17, 19; Prado Guide, 409&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wears a curved Polish or Hungarian type of ''[[szabla]]'' ([[sabre]]). Behind the two boys is a figure of uncertain gender wearing the modified Roman military uniform typically worn by goddesses and allegorical figures in Northern Mannerism; there is a similar figure at the front of the Munich ''Feast''.  

This mixture, both as to the depiction of faces and of clothing, is reminiscent of many northern religious paintings of the 15th and 16th centuries, especially those showing the [[Passion of Jesus]].  There are reminiscences of the fantastical style of the printmaker [[Jacques Bellange]], another artist whose homeland of Lorraine was to be ravaged by the war.  One critic finds the "blurred edges, eclecticism, mixed registers and parodic deflation of late Renaissance poetry are mirrored in [[Mannerist]] painting, from Jacques Bellange to Bartholomeus Strobel".&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Hoyt, ''The poetics of inconstancy: Etienne Durand and the end of Renaissance verse'', p. 221, 1998, University of North Carolina, {{ISBN|0807892602}}, 9780807892602&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite its late date, Strobel's work remains rooted in the Rudolfine [[Northern Mannerism]] of [[Prague]] which he had absorbed in his youth.&lt;ref&gt;Ossowski, 22&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The date of the painting and the circumstances of its commission remain unclear. To some extent these questions are tied to the identification of the portrait figures, in particular those of the boys or youths, as their appearances relate to a narrow time period. According to Harosimowicz, the source used for identifying the figures above, the painting "was probably created in Elbing under the patronage of Gerhard and Margaretha von Dönhoff in the period from 1640 to 1642". The [[Dönhoff]] family were wealthy German Protestant aristocrats in Silesia, who were also becoming integrated into the Polish nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Harosimowicz; for [[Gerhard Dönhoff]] (1590–1648), [[Pomerania during the Early Modern Age|Governor of Pomerania]] and administrator of [[Malbork|Marienburg]] for the Polish crown, see [[:pl:Gerard Denhoff (syn)]] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=68Y0pJRcTV4C&amp;pg=PA48 ''Schlesien in der Frühmoderne'', by Norbert Conrads].  He was the brother of [[Kasper Doenhoff]] and [[Ernst Magnus Dönhoff]], of a Baltic German family who had joined the Polish nobility.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1637 Dönhoff married Margaretha, the daughter of Duke John Christian of Brieg, whose features may be depicted on the head of John the Baptist.

Another suggestion for the patron (but with similar dating) is King [[Władysław IV Vasa]] of Poland (r. 1632–1649), who had appointed Strobel court artist in 1639.&lt;ref&gt;Jagiello&lt;/ref&gt;  The king's half-brother [[Karol Ferdynand Vasa]], [[Prince-Bishop of Wrocław]] (Breslau), whose court painter Strobel had previously been before he left Breslau in about 1633, has also been suggested, with an earlier dating to 1630–33, as used by the Prado (thus preceding Wallenstein's assassination).  Only the Prince-Bishop's coat of arms are shown in the painting, and it may have been at his palace at [[Nysa, Poland|Nysa]].&lt;ref&gt;Ossowski, 21; Prado biography; Prado Guide, 409&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bartholomaeus-strobel-dj-das-gastmahl-des-herodes-223579.jpg|thumb|The [[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]] ''Feast of Herod'', now attributed to Strobel]]

By 1746 the painting was in the Spanish Royal Collection, belonging to [[Elisabeth Farnese]], Queen to [[Philip V of Spain]], and hung in "the room where their Majesties eat" in the [[Royal Palace of La Granja de San Ildefonso]], which Philip had built in the 1720s as a summer palace in the mountains near Madrid.  Philip had died that year, and his successor [[Ferdinand VI of Spain]] had granted the palace and its contents to his step-mother. In the year of her death in 1766 it was still inventoried at La Granja, but in 1794 and 1818 it was recorded at the newer [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]].&lt;ref&gt;Prado page&lt;/ref&gt; Once in the Prado with the rest of the Spanish royal collection it was for long not on public display.  In the 2000s, with the remodelling around the construction of a new wing to the rear, gallery space was found for the painting, which now greets visitors who entered by the new wing as they emerge from the lifts on the main floor in the old building.&lt;ref&gt;The space (room 11b) is not numbered on the museum plan, but is between rooms 11 and 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was long vaguely attributed to an unknown Flemish artist, with suggestions that [[Joachim von Sandrart]], [[Hendrik Goltzius]] or [[Bartholomeus Spranger]] might be responsible, or an unknown artist from [[Lorraine (duchy)|Lorraine]] or [[Augsburg]].  The first attribution to Strobel was made in 1970 by Jaromir Neumann, which was confirmed by Lode Seghers in 1987, on stylistic comparison with a ''David and [[Bathsheba]]'' signed by Strobel, now in Wallenstein's former castle at [[Mnichovo Hradiště]], [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Ossowski, 14–16; Prado Catalogo, 377; Fresco&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequent comparisons with other documented works by Strobel have confirmed the attribution, which now seems generally accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Ossowski, 16–19&lt;/ref&gt;

==Munich version==
On the basis of the Prado identification another ''Feast of Herod'' in the [[Alte Pinakothek]], [[Munich]], far smaller at 95 x 73&amp;nbsp;cm, was also attributed to Strobel, probably with an earlier date. This "extremely fascinating, involved and mysterious picture" shares many characteristics with the Prado's work, also containing portraits of political and military leaders, mixture of styles, and a complex picture space, with in this case the main feast in the upper background seen through columns.  It had previously been attributed to [[Jacques Bellange]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;Alte Pinakotek, 523-524, 523 quoted; rather oddly Ossowski does not mention this work.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suggested subjects for portraits in the work include [[Johann Tserclaes, Count of Tilly]], who from 1610 until he died of his wounds in 1632 was the Imperial and [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]] field marshal before Wallenstein, and commander at the notorious [[Sack of Magdeburg]] in 1631.  He may be the figure to the left behind the balustrade.  The man reading to his right may also be a portrait.  The "richly attired man with a pointed beard" at the right hand side of the dining table above may be [[Gabor Bethlen]] (d 1629), the Calvinist [[Prince of Transylvania]] and Protestant claimant to be [[King of Hungary]], leader of the Hungarian anti-Habsburg forces in the war.  His widow [[Catherine of Brandenburg]] may be one of the ladies portrayed in the Prado version.&lt;ref&gt;Alte Pinakotek, 524&lt;/ref&gt;

Stroebel's ''Daniel and Cyrus before the Idol Bel'' (1636–1637) in the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]], [[Warsaw]] is a similar composition, with the figures in eclectic and extravagant costumes, and a feast seen in progress at a lower level in the background.  It is still smaller at 39.5 × 30 cm (15.6 × 11.8 in), and in oil on copper.

'''''Finding Dawn''''' is a 2006 [[documentary film]] by [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] filmmaker [[Christine Welsh]] looking into the fate of an estimated 500 [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian Aboriginal]] women who have been [[Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women|murdered or have gone missing]] over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name="CSWS"/&gt;

==Subject==
The film begins with the story of Dawn Crey: one of 60 women, a third of them Aboriginal, who have disappeared from [[Vancouver]]'s [[Downtown Eastside]] over a 20-year period. Crey's remains were among those found on the property of British Columbia serial killer [[Robert Pickton]].&lt;ref name="Herizons"&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'CONNOR |first=JENNIFER|date=Winter 2009 |title=FINDING DAWN|journal=Herizons|publisher=Bnet|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7554/is_200901/ai_n32313401/?tag=content;col1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Georgia Straight"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.straight.com/article/metis-filmmaker-christine-welsh-can-be-proud-of-her-showing-at-the-amnesty-international-film-festival|title=Métis filmmaker Christine Welsh can be proud of her showing at the Amnesty International Film Festival|date=November 9, 2006|work=[[Georgia Straight]]|accessdate=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not enough of Dawn's DNA was found to list her as one of the murder victims at the trial. The film introduces viewers to Dawn sister and brother, and their involvement in the annual [[Women’s Memorial March]] in Vancouver.&lt;ref name="CM"&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Vos|first=Gail |date=January 11, 2008 |title=FINDING DAWN|journal=Canadian Materials|publisher=Manitoba Library Association|volume= XIV |issue= 10|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/outreach/cm/vol14/no10/findingdawn.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film then focuses on BC's Highway 16, known as the [[Highway of Tears murders|Highway of Tears]], which runs between [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]] and [[Prince George, British Columbia]], looking at the fate of Ramona Wilson.&lt;ref name="CM"/&gt; Wilson was one of nine women&amp;nbsp;– all but one of them Native&amp;nbsp;– who have gone missing or been murdered on that stretch of road since the 1990s.

Welsh also filmed in [[Saskatoon]], where a woman named Daleen Kay Bosse disappeared in 2004. She went missing in May but a criminal investigation didn't begin until the following January.&lt;ref name="Herizons"/&gt; In the film, Daleen’s parents and friends talk about their difficulty in getting Saskatoon police to take Daleen’s disappearance seriously.&lt;ref name="CM"/&gt;

Native rights activists [[Janice Acoose]] and [[Fay Blaney]] are interviewed in the film.&lt;ref name="Herizons"/&gt;

Christine Welsh has produced, written and directed films for more than 30 years. She is an associate professor at the [[University of Victoria]], where she teaches courses in indigenous women’s studies and [[indigenous cinema]].&lt;ref name="CSWS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csws.uoregon.edu/?p=1097 |title=Acclaimed Feminist Filmmaker To Screen "Finding Dawn" |last= |first= |date= |publisher=[[University of Oregon]] |work=[[Center for the Study of Women in Society]] |accessdate=26 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508140428/http://csws.uoregon.edu/?p=1097 |archivedate=8 May 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--If the artwork has a proper title, then it should be italicized here and in the title of the article above--&gt;'''''Free Basket''''' is a public artwork by the [[Cuba]]n artist group [[Los Carpinteros]], located in the [[100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art and Nature Park]], in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. The artwork is in the form of an international basketball court with twenty-four red or blue steel arches that travel throughout the court, mimicking the trajectory of two bouncing basketballs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art &amp; Nature Park|year=2010|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-936260-88-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the arches terminate with their own regulation size basketball hoop, netting, and backboard.

==Description==
''Free Basket'' is located outside the boundary of the 100 Acres park on city property.  The parking loop surrounding the artwork is situated just south of the Lake and west of the museum.  The artwork can be accessed by means of the IWC Canal Greenway (Central Canal Trail), W 38th Street, and the 100 Acres Park walkway.  ''Free Basket'' is a site-specific work consisting of twenty-four red- or blue-painted steel tubular arches that mimic the trajectory of two bouncing basketballs.  The arches travel throughout the court and are of varying heights and span widths.  Two of the arches (one red and one blue) are capped at midpoint, each with their own basketball backboard fashioned with: backboard, metal rim, and nylon net.  The steel arches have been mounted on a level, rectangular concrete surface that is size of an international basketball court, where they have been filled and secured with concrete cement.  The concrete court has been surfaced with Rhino Guard colored plastic and has been painted to the standards of an international basketball court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=100 Acres: The Virginia B. Fairbanks Art &amp; Nature Park|year=2010|publisher=Indianapolis Museum of Art|isbn=978-0-936260-88-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary court color is yellow, the “goal lines” are painted white, and sections of black and green flank both sides of the court, and a black border surrounds entire court.  There are also built-in lighting systems that have been sunk into the court to illuminate the sculpture.

==Historical information==
Los Carpinteros sought to portray the juxtaposition of the practical and the imaginary with ''Free Basket'', and drew on the history of sports in Indianapolis to merge art, sports, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ArtBabble: Play Art Loud|title=Los Carpinteros: In the Factory|url=http://www.artbabble.org/video/ima/los-carpinteros-factory|accessdate=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location history===
This artwork was installed at the IMA in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheets.|first=Hilarie M.|title=100 Acres to Roam, No Restrictions|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/13/arts/design/13park.html|accessdate=2011-08-28|date=June 29, 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition===
''Free Basket'' has been acquired by the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].

'''Friedrich Horst Winkler''' (5 March 1888 - 23 February 1965)&lt;ref name=kalliope&gt;{{cite web|title=Winkler, Friedrich (1888-1965)|url=http://kalliope.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/de/eac?eac.id=118769340|website=Kalliope|publisher=Staatsbibliothek Berlin|accessdate=17 February 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a German art historian specialised in German art, especially the works of [[Albrecht Dürer]], and [[Early Netherlandish painting]] from the 15th and 16th century.

==Biography==
Friedrich Winkler was born at his family's farm in Prehna, a hamlet of [[Lumpzig]], Germany, in 1888.&lt;ref name="DAH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistorians.info/winklerf|title=Winkler, Friedrich|last=|first=|date=|website=Dictionary of Art Historians|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied art history at the [[University of Vienna]], the [[University of Berlin]], and the [[University of Freiburg]], where he studied under [[Wilhelm Vöge]]. His [[thesis]] ''Der [[Robert Campin|Meister von Flemalle]] und [[Rogier van der Weyden]]'', written in 1912, was published in 1913.&lt;ref name=DAH/&gt;

He then started working as the editor of the ''[[Thieme-Becker|Lexikon der bildenden Künstler]]'' by [[Ulrich Thieme]] and [[Felix Becker (art historian)|Felix Becker]], for which he wrote 34 entries. He also worked as a volunteer at the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] in [[Dresden]], but then joined the army during [[World War I]]. He left the army in 1915 to become the director of the [[Kunstbibliothek Berlin]]. he wrote a work on Early Netherlandish [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]], and in 1924 reworked ''Die Altniederländisch Malerei von 1400-1600'', originally written by [[Max Jacob Friedländer]]. In 1925 appeared ''Die Flämische Buchmalerei'', about Flemish miniature painting. In this period he married Hermina Christina Schützinger.&lt;ref name=DAH/&gt;

Winkler then started working on the ''[[Catalogue raisonné]]'' of the drawings by [[Albrecht Dürer]], which was started by [[Friedrich Lippmann]] (1838-1903). Winkler wrote the final two volumes of the catalog and a book about Dûrer, which were published in the late 1920s. In 1933 he succeeded the deceased [[Elfried Bock]] as Keeper of the [[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin]]. Between 1936 and 1939 he published a new catalogue of the drawings of Dürer in 4 volumes.&lt;ref name=DAH/&gt;

In 1942 he published a work on the drawings of [[Hans von Kulmbach]] and [[Hans Leonhard Schäufelein]], both pupils of Dürer. In 1947 he became a lecturer at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] and in 1951 he switched to Western Germany and the [[Free University of Berlin]], until he retired in 1957. That year he wrote ''Leben und Werke'', a biography of Dürer. After another work on Hans von Kulmbach, he published his final major work in 1964, ''Das Werk des [[Hugo van der Goes]]''.&lt;ref name=DAH/&gt; In 1950 he was made a corresponding member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]].&lt;ref name=Muller/&gt;

A heart attack late in 1964 led to his death in February 1965.&lt;ref name=DAH/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15894">The following is a '''list of unproduced George Miller projects''' in roughly chronological order. During a career that has spanned over 40 years, [[George Miller (director)|George Miller]] has worked on projects which never progressed beyond the [[pre-production]] stage under his direction. A few of the projects were made after he left production.

==1990s==

===''Contact''===
* In 1993, Miller was hired to direct ''[[Contact (1997 American film)|Contact]]'' based on the story by [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Ann Druyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Head|first=Tom|url=https://www.amazon.com/Conversations-Sagan-University-Mississippi-Paperback/dp/B00DWWC4HA|title=Conversations with Carl Sagan|date=5 January 2006|publisher=[[University Press of Mississippi]]|location=[[Jackson, Mississippi]]|page=89|access-date=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Contact'' commenced pre-production. Miller cast [[Jodie Foster]] in the lead role, approached [[Ralph Fiennes]] to play Palmer Joss and also considered casting [[Linda Hunt]] as the [[President of the United States]]. In addition to having aliens put on a [[laser lighting display]] around Earth, another version of the Goldenberg scripts had an alien wormhole swallow up the planet, transporting Earth to the center of the galaxy. Miller also asked Goldenberg to rewrite ''Contact'' in an attempt to portray the [[Pope]] as a key supporting character. Warner Bros. was hoping to have the film ready for release by Christmas 1996, but under Miller's direction pre-production lasted longer than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Benjamin Svetkey | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,288672,00.html | title = Making Contact | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | date = 1997-07-18 | accessdate = 2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The studio  fired the director, blaming pushed-back start dates, budget concerns, and Miller's insistence that the script needed five more weeks of rewriting after working on the film for over a year. [[Robert Zemeckis]] was eventually brought on to direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chitwood|first1=Adam|title=George Miller Talks His Version of CONTACT; Likens It to INTERSTELLAR|url=http://collider.com/contact-george-miller-reveals-his-version-of-movie-was-like-interstellar/|website=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000s==

===''Justice League: Mortal''===
* In 2007, Miller signed on to direct a [[Justice League]] film titled ''[[Justice League in other media#Film|Justice League: Mortal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garrett|first1=Diane|title=George Miller to lead ‘Justice League’|url=https://variety.com/2007/film/features/george-miller-to-lead-justice-league-2-1117972369/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|accessdate=8 May 2015|date=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month roughly 40 actors and actresses were auditioning for the ensemble superhero roles, among them were [[Joseph Cross (actor)|Joseph Cross]], [[Michael Angarano]], [[Max Thieriot]], [[Minka Kelly]], [[Adrianne Palicki]] and [[Scott Porter]]. Miller intended to cast younger actors as he wanted them to "grow" into their roles over the course of several films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Borys| last = Kit | title = The Vine: Young actors seek ''Justice'' | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/vine-young-actors-seek-justice-152538| date = 2007-10-15 | accessdate = 2008-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[D.

[[Aquaman]] had yet to be cast.

==2010s==

===''Happy Feet 3''===
* In a 2011 interview, Miller was asked if he had any plans for ''[[Happy Feet Two#Possible_sequel|Happy Feet Three]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://collider.com/george-miller-happy-feet-2-mad-max-interview/126581/ |title=Director George Miller Talks HAPPY FEET TWO, MAD MAX, and JUSTICE LEAGUE |accessdate=January 21, 2012 |work=collider.com |date=November 16, 2011 |author=Christina Radish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"If you put a gun to my head and said, 'You have to come up with a story for ''Happy Feet 3'',' I’d say shoot me. I would have no idea. I really would have no idea. The stories creep up on you. You just have to allow the stories to come, and then they get in like little ear worms in your head and they won’t go away. If that happens and we’ve got the energy, we’ll do a third one. If it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen. That’s the only way you can do it. It has to be authentic. I really wanted to make this film better than the first one. Otherwise, at my age, what’s the point? You really want to make it better. If something comes up that’s really exciting and I can convey that enthusiasm to other people, then there would be a third one."|George Miller}}

===''Mad Max: Fury Road'' (sequels and spinoffs)===
* In 2011, Miller and McCarthy found during the writing process for ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]'' that they had enough story material for two additional scripts. One of these, entitled ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road#Sequels|Mad Max: Furiosa]]'', had already been completed, and Miller hoped to film it after the release of ''Fury Road''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Turner|first1=Brook|title=George Miller's new script|url=http://www.afr.com/p/george_miller_new_script_q1wYu1EFjLM0cyZa4s97fI|website=[[The Australian Financial Review]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|access-date=8 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407192950/http://www.afr.com/p/george_miller_new_script_q1wYu1EFjLM0cyZa4s97fI|archivedate=7 April 2014|date=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, during an interview with ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', Hardy revealed that he was attached to star in three more ''Mad Max'' films following ''Fury Road''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/film-tv/8074/tom-hardy-esquire-interview/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331190806/http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/film-tv/8074/tom-hardy-esquire-interview/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=31 March 2015|title=Tom Hardy Is Esquire's May Cover Star|first=Miranda|last=Collinge|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=30 March 2015|access-date=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, Miller told ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'': "Should ''Fury Road'' be successful, I've got two other stories to tell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/05/mad-max-fury-road/|title=Mad Max: What it takes to make the most intense movie ever |first=Logan|last=Hill|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|publisher=([[Condé Nast]])|date=11 May 2015|access-date=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in May, Miller revealed that plans for the sequel had changed and the fifth film in the franchise will instead be titled ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road#Sequel|Mad Max: The Wasteland]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lussier|first1=Germain|title=George Miller Gives 'Mad Max: Fury Road' Sequel a Title|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/george-miller-mad-max-fury-road-sequel/|website=[[/Film]]|access-date=19 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519013857/http://www.slashfilm.com/george-miller-mad-max-fury-road-sequel/|archivedate=19 May 2015|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=George Miller Promises 'More Max,' Starting With 'Mad Max: The Wasteland'|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/mad-max-george-miller-announces-more-movies-mad-max-the-wasteland-1201499904/|website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|access-date=19 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519013352/http://variety.com/2015/film/news/mad-max-george-miller-announces-more-movies-mad-max-the-wasteland-1201499904/|archivedate=19 May 2015|date=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, Miller's team had two scripts for sequels which they ended up with during the writing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/mad-max-the-wasteland-director-george-miller-confirms-fury-road-will-have-two-sequels-a6679756.html|title= Mad Max: The Wasteland: Director George Miller confirms Fury Road will have two sequels|author= Jack Shepherd|work= [[The Independent]]|publisher= Independent Print Limited|date= 5 October 2015|access-date= 11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, he clarified that ''Mad Max: The Wasteland'' was a [[working title]] for the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.digitalspy.com/movies/news/a673073/mad-max-fury-road-sequel-wont-star-charlize-therons-imperator-furiosa/#~pr3amDojvbH6bH|title= Mad Max Fury Road sequel won't star Charlize Theron's Imperator Furiosa|author= Simon Reynolds|work= [[Digital Spy]]|publisher= [[Hearst Corporation]]|date= 12 October 2015|access-date= 11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller reaffirmed his intent to continue the franchise after reports to the contrary surfaced following an interview in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/george-miller-new-mad-max-movies/|title=George Miller Will Be Involved with Mad Max Sequels|date=14 January 2016|work=Collider}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2017, it was reported that a lawsuit filed by Miller's production company against Warner Bros. over a disputed $7 million bonus was likely to delay the production of any sequels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://amp.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/george-miller-sues-warner-bros-over-mad-max-fury-road-earnings-20171109-gziinh.html|title=Director George Miller sues Warner Bros over Mad Max: Fury Road earnings|date=2017-11-11|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2018-01-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller also wants a Furiosa spin-off starring [[Charlize Theron]] as the one-armed female warrior.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/apr/18/mad-max-fury-road-sequel-george-miller?subid=5542353&amp;CMP=ema_861a&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the sequels and spinoffs have been delayed indefinitely until after the lawsuit is settled.

In [[music]], '''harmony''' considers the process by which the composition of individual sounds, or superpositions of sounds, is analysed by hearing. Usually, this means simultaneously occurring [[frequencies]], [[pitch (music)|pitches]] ([[timbre|tones]], [[note (music)|notes]]), or [[chord (music)|chords]].&lt;ref&gt;Malm, William P. (1996). ''Music Cultures of the Pacific, the Near East, and Asia'', p.15. {{ISBN|0-13-182387-6}}. Third edition. "Homophonic texture...is more common in Western music, where tunes are often built on chords (harmonies) that move in progressions. Indeed this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music."&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of harmony involves chords and their construction and [[chord progression]]s and the principles of connection that govern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Harmony|author=Dahlhaus, Car|access-date=24 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harmony is often said to refer to the "vertical" aspect of music, as distinguished from [[melody|melodic line]], or the "horizontal" aspect.&lt;ref name=Jamini&gt;Jamini, Deborah (2005). ''Harmony and Composition: Basics to Intermediate'', p.147. {{ISBN|1-4120-3333-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Counterpoint]], which refers to the relationship between melodic lines, and [[polyphony]], which refers to the simultaneous sounding of separate independent voices, are thus sometimes distinguished from harmony.

In [[popular harmony|popular]] and [[jazz harmony]], chords are named by their [[root (chord)|root]] plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities.  In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern, and jazz, chords are often augmented with "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant interval]] in relation to the bass.

Typically, in the classical [[common practice period]] a dissonant chord (chord with tension) "resolves" to a consonant chord. [[Harmonization]] usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments.

== Etymology and definitions ==
The term ''harmony'' derives from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἁρμονία}} ''harmonia'', meaning "joint, agreement, concord",&lt;ref&gt;'1. Harmony' ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Etymology in English Language Reference'' accessed via [http://www.oxfordreference.com/ Oxford Reference Online] (24 February 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(rmoni/a|ἁρμονία|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; from the verb {{lang|grc|ἁρμόζω}} ''harmozō'', "(Ι) fit together, join".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(rmo/zw|ἁρμόζω|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, ''harmony'' often referred to the whole field of music, while ''music'' referred to the arts in general.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} In Ancient Greece, the term defined the combination of contrasted elements: a higher and lower note.&lt;ref name="grovelead"&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Harmony|author=Dahlhaus, Carl|access-date=24 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is unclear whether the simultaneous sounding of notes was part of ancient Greek musical practice; ''harmonía'' may have merely provided a system of classification of the relationships between different pitches.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} In the Middle Ages the term was used to describe two pitches sounding in combination, and in the Renaissance the concept was expanded to denote three pitches sounding together.&lt;ref name = "grovelead" /&gt; [[Aristoxenus]] wrote a work entitled ''[[Elementa harmonica|Harmonika Stoicheia]]'', which is thought the first work in European history written on the subject of harmony.&lt;ref name="Aristoxenus, Henry Stewart Macran"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3TseQjV_wogC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;lpg=PA165&amp;dq=translations+of+Aristoxenus+Elements+of+Harmony&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aDzoOJl1aD&amp;sig=n4ldPcu--zEZ_Kzxv_8MuCe73oY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dL5GVcH6JdjiasmTgPgM&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=translations%20of%20Aristoxenus%20Elements%20of%20Harmony&amp;f=false|author=Aristoxenus, Henry Stewart Macran|title=Harmonika Stoicheia (The Harmonics of Aristoxenus)|publisher=Georg Olms Verlag 1902 {{ISBN|3487405105}}|accessdate=2015-05-04}}(and [http://www.worldcat.org/title/aristoxenoy-armonika-stoicheia-the-harmonics-of-aristoxenus/oclc/123175755 World Cat])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rameau Traite de l’harmonie.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Rameau]]'s ''Traité de l'harmonie'' (''Treatise on Harmony''), 1722]]
It was not until the publication of [[Rameau]]'s ''Traité de l'harmonie'' (''Treatise on Harmony'') in 1722 that any text discussing musical practice made use of the term in the title, although that work is not the earliest record of theoretical discussion of the topic. The underlying principle behind these texts is that harmony sanctions harmoniousness (sounds that please) by conforming to certain pre-established compositional principles.&lt;ref name = "oxfordcompanion"&gt;Arnold Whittall, ''The Oxford Companion to Music'', ed. Alison Latham, (Oxford University Press, 2002) (accessed via [Oxford Reference Online], 16 November 2007  [http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?this is gayubview=Main&amp;entry=t114.e3144] )&lt;/ref&gt;

Current dictionary definitions, while attempting to give concise descriptions, often highlight the ambiguity of the term in modern use. Ambiguities tend to arise from either aesthetic considerations (for example the view that only pleasing concords may be harmonious) or from the point of view of musical texture (distinguishing between harmonic (simultaneously sounding pitches) and "contrapuntal" (successively sounding tones).&lt;ref name = "oxfordcompanion" /&gt; In the words of [[Arnold Whittall]]:

{{quote|While the entire history of music theory appears to depend on just such a distinction between harmony and counterpoint, it is no less evident that developments in the nature of musical composition down the centuries have presumed the interdependence—at times amounting to integration, at other times a source of sustained tension—between the vertical and horizontal dimensions of musical space.&lt;ref name = "oxfordcompanion" /&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}}}

The view that modern [[tonality|tonal]] harmony in Western music began in about 1600 is commonplace in music theory. This is usually accounted for by the replacement of horizontal (or [[contrapuntal]]) composition, common in the music of the [[Renaissance]], with a new emphasis on the vertical element of composed music. Modern theorists, however, tend to see this as an unsatisfactory generalisation. According to [[Carl Dahlhaus]]:

{{quote|It was not that counterpoint was supplanted by harmony (Bach’s tonal counterpoint is surely no less polyphonic than Palestrina’s modal writing) but that an older type both of counterpoint and of vertical technique was succeeded by a newer type. And harmony comprises not only the ("vertical") structure of chords but also their ("horizontal") movement. Like music as a whole, harmony is a process.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|author=Carl Dahlhaus|title=Harmony, §3: Historical development|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see also Whittall 'Harmony: 4. Practice and Principle', ''Oxford Companion to Music''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}}}

Descriptions and definitions of harmony and harmonic practice may show bias towards [[Europe]]an (or [[Western culture|Western]]) musical traditions.  For example, South Asian art music ([[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] and [[Carnatic music]]) is frequently cited as placing little emphasis on what is perceived in western practice as conventional harmony; the underlying harmonic foundation for most South Asian music is the [[drone (music)|drone]], a held open [[fifth interval]] (or fourth interval) that does not alter in pitch throughout the course of a composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=India, §I, 2(ii): Music and musicians: Art music|author=Regula Qureshi|access-date=16 November 2007}} and Catherine Schmidt Jones, 'Listening to Indian Classical Music', Connexions, (accessed 16 November 2007) [http://cnx.org/content/m12502/latest/]&lt;/ref&gt; Pitch simultaneity in particular is rarely a major consideration. Nevertheless, many other considerations of pitch are relevant to the music, its theory and its structure, such as the complex system of [[Rāga]]s, which combines both melodic and modal considerations and codifications within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=India, §III, 2: Theory and practice of classical music: Rāga|author=Harold S. Powers|author2=Richard Widdess|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, intricate pitch combinations that sound simultaneously do occur in [[Indian classical music]]—but they are rarely studied as [[teleological]] harmonic or [[contrapuntal]] progressions—as with notated Western music. This contrasting emphasis (with regard to Indian music in particular) manifests itself in the different methods of performance adopted: in Indian Music improvisation takes a major role in the structural framework of a piece,&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=India, §III, 3(ii): Theory and practice of classical music: Melodic elaboration|author=Harold S. Powers|author2=Richard Widdess|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Western Music improvisation has been uncommon since the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Improvisation, §II: Western art music|author=Rob C. Wegman|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where it does occur in Western music (or has in the past), the improvisation either embellishes pre-notated music or draws from musical models previously established in notated compositions, and therefore uses familiar harmonic schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Improvisation, §II, 4(i): The Classical period in Western art music: Instrumental music|author=Robert D Levin|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, emphasis on the precomposed in European art music and the written theory surrounding it shows considerable cultural bias. The ''Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' (Oxford University Press) identifies this clearly:

{{quote|In Western culture the musics that are most dependent on improvisation, such as jazz, have traditionally been regarded as inferior to art music, in which pre-composition is considered paramount. The conception of musics that live in oral traditions as something composed with the use of improvisatory techniques separates them from the higher-standing works that use notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Improvisation, §I, 2: Concepts and practices: Improvisation in musical cultures|author=Bruno Nettl|access-date=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet the evolution of harmonic practice and language itself, in Western art music, is and was facilitated by this process of prior composition, which permitted the study and analysis by theorists and composers of individual pre-constructed works in which pitches (and to some extent rhythms) remained unchanged regardless of the nature of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;See Whittall, 'Harmony'&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical rules ==
Some traditions of Western music performance, [[Musical composition|composition]], and [[music theory|theory]] have specific rules of harmony.  These rules are often described as based on natural properties such as [[Pythagorean tuning]]'s law whole number ratios ("harmoniousness" being inherent in the ratios either perceptually or in themselves) or [[harmonic]]s and [[Acoustic resonance|resonances]] ("harmoniousness" being inherent in the quality of sound), with the allowable pitches and harmonies gaining their beauty or simplicity from their closeness to those properties. This model provides that the minor seventh and (major) ninth are not dissonant (i.e., are consonant).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Early Western religious music often features parallel perfect intervals; these intervals would preserve the clarity of the original [[plainsong]]. These works were created and performed in cathedrals, and made use of the resonant modes of their respective cathedrals to create harmonies. As polyphony developed, however, the use of parallel intervals was slowly replaced by the English style of consonance that used thirds and sixths.{{when|date=September 2014}} The English style was considered to have a sweeter sound, and was better suited to polyphony in that it offered greater linear flexibility in part-writing. Early music also forbade usage of the [[tritone]], due to its dissonance, and composers often went to considerable lengths, via [[musica ficta]], to avoid using it. In the newer triadic harmonic system, however, the tritone became permissible, as the standardization of [[Consonance and dissonance#Dissonance|functional dissonance]] made its use in dominant chords desirable.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Most harmony comes from two or more notes sounding simultaneously—but a work can imply harmony with only one melodic line by using [[arpeggio]]s or [[hocket]]. Many pieces from the [[baroque music|baroque]] period for solo [[string instrument]]s—such as Bach's [[Sonatas and partitas for solo violin]] and cello—convey subtle harmony through inference rather than full chordal structures. These works create a sense of harmonies by using arpeggiated chords and implied bass lines. The implied basslines are created with low notes of short duration that many listeners perceive as being the bass note of a chord.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

[[File:Bach cello harmony.JPG|center|thumb|400px|Example of implied harmonies in [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.S. Bach's]] [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Cello Suite]] no. 1 in G, BWV 1007, bars 1–2. {{audio|Bach cello harmony.mid|Play}} or {{audio|Bach cello harmony chords.mid|Play harmony}}]]

== Types ==
[[File:C triad.svg|thumb|right|Close position C major triad. {{audio|Major triad on C.mid|Play}}]]
[[File:C triad open position.svg|thumb|right|Open position C major triad. {{audio|C triad open position.mid|Play}}]]

[[Carl Dahlhaus]] (1990) distinguishes between ''coordinate'' and ''subordinate harmony''. ''Subordinate harmony'' is the [[hierarchical]] [[tonality]] or tonal harmony well known today. ''Coordinate harmony'' is the older [[Medieval music|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] ''tonalité ancienne'', "The term is meant to signify that sonorities are linked one after the other without giving rise to the impression of a goal-directed development. A first chord forms a 'progression' with a second chord, and a second with a third. But the former chord progression is independent of the later one and vice versa." Coordinate harmony follows direct (adjacent) relationships rather than indirect as in subordinate. [[Interval cycle]]s create symmetrical harmonies, which have been extensively used by the composers [[Alban Berg]], [[George Perle]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Béla Bartók]], and [[Edgard Varèse]]'s ''[[Density 21.5]]''.

Close harmony and open harmony use close position and open position chords, respectively. See: [[voicing (music)]] and [[close and open harmony]].

Other types of harmony are based upon the intervals of the chords used in that harmony. Most chords in western music are based on "tertian" harmony, or chords built with the interval of thirds. In the chord C Major7, C–E is a major third; E–G is a minor third; and G to B is a major third. Other types of harmony consist of [[quartal and quintal harmony]].

A [[unison]] is considered a harmonic interval, just like a fifth or a third, but is unique in that it is two identical notes produced together. The unison, as a component of harmony, is important, especially in orchestration.&lt;ref name="grovelead" /&gt; In pop music, unison singing is usually called ''doubling'', a technique [[The Beatles]] used in many of their earlier recordings. As a type of harmony, singing in unison or playing the same notes, often using different musical instruments, at the same time is commonly called [[monophony|monophonic]] [[harmonization]].

== Intervals ==
An [[interval (music)|interval]] is the relationship between two separate musical pitches. For example, in the melody ''[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]'', the first two notes (the first "twinkle") and the second two notes (the second "twinkle") are at the interval of one fifth. What this means is that if the first two notes were the pitch '''C''', the second two notes would be the pitch "G"—four scale notes, or seven chromatic notes (a perfect fifth), above it.

The following are common intervals:

|-
| B{{music|b}}
| D
| D{{music|b}}
| F
|-
| B
| D{{music|#}}
| D
| F{{music|#}}
|}

Therefore, the combination of notes with their specific intervals—a chord—creates harmony. For example, in a C chord, there are three notes: C, E, and G. The note '''C''' is the root. The notes '''E''' and '''G''' provide harmony, and in a G7 (G dominant 7th) chord, the root G with each subsequent note (in this case B, D and F) provide the harmony.

&lt;!-- I will leave the following below for the moment, but is it really relevant to this article?? (Please see talk page)--&gt;
In the musical scale, there are twelve pitches. Each pitch is referred to as a "degree" of the scale. The names A, B, C, D, E, F, and G are insignificant. The intervals, however, are not. Here is an example:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 1°
! 2°
! 3°
! 4°
! 5°
! 6°
! 7°
! 8°
|-
| C

| E

| G
| A
| B
| C
|-
| D
| E
| F{{music|sharp}}
| G
| A
| B
| C{{music|sharp}}
| D
|}

As can be seen, no note always corresponds to a certain degree of the scale. The ''tonic'', or 1st-degree note, can be any of the 12 notes (pitch classes) of the chromatic scale. All the other notes fall into place. For example, when C is the tonic, the fourth degree or subdominant is F. When D is the tonic, the fourth degree is G. While the note names remain constant, they may refer to different scale degrees, implying different intervals with respect to the tonic. The great power of this fact is that any musical work can be played or sung in any key. It is the same piece of music, as long as the intervals are the same—thus transposing the melody into the corresponding key. When the intervals surpass the perfect Octave (12 semitones), these intervals are called ''compound intervals'', which include particularly the 9th, 11th, and 13th Intervals—widely used in [[jazz]] and [[blues]] Music.

Compound Intervals are formed and named as follows:
*2nd + Octave = 9th
*3rd + octave = 10th
*4th + Octave = 11th
*5th + octave = 12th
*6th + Octave = 13th
*7th + octave = 14th

The reason the two numbers don't "add" correctly is that one note is counted twice. Apart from this categorization, intervals can also be divided into consonant and dissonant. As explained in the following paragraphs, consonant intervals produce a sensation of relaxation and dissonant intervals a sensation of tension. In tonal music, the term consonant also means "brings resolution" (to some degree at least, whereas dissonance "requires resolution").

The consonant intervals are considered the perfect [[unison]], [[octave]], [[Perfect fifth|fifth]], [[Perfect fourth|fourth]] and major and minor third and sixth, and their compound forms. An interval is referred to as "perfect" when the harmonic relationship is found in the natural overtone series (namely, the unison 1:1, octave 2:1, fifth 3:2, and fourth 4:3). The other basic intervals (second, third, sixth, and seventh) are called "imperfect" because the harmonic relationships are not found mathematically exact in the overtone series. In classical music the perfect fourth above the bass may be considered dissonant when its function is [[contrapuntal]]. Other intervals, the second and the seventh (and their compound forms) are considered Dissonant and require resolution (of the produced tension) and usually preparation (depending on the music style).

Note that the effect of dissonance is perceived relatively within musical context: for example, a major seventh interval alone (i.e., C up to B) may be perceived as dissonant, but the same interval as part of a major seventh chord may sound relatively consonant. A tritone (the interval of the fourth step to the seventh step of the major scale, i.e., F to B) sounds very dissonant alone, but less so within the context of a dominant seventh chord (G7 or D{{music|b}}7 in that example).

== Chords and tension ==
{{Main article|Chord (music)|Consonance and dissonance}}
In the Western tradition, in music after the seventeenth century, harmony is manipulated using [[chord (music)|chord]]s, which are combinations of [[pitch class]]es. In [[tertian]] harmony, so named after the interval of a third, the members of chords are found and named by stacking intervals of the third, starting with the "root", then the "third" above the root, and the "fifth" above the root (which is a third above the third), etc. (Note that chord members are named after their interval above the root.) [[dyad (music)|Dyad]]s, the simplest chords, contain only two members (see [[power chord]]s).

A chord with three members is called a [[Triad (music)|triad]] because it has three members, not because it is necessarily built in thirds (see [[Quartal and quintal harmony]] for chords built with other intervals). Depending on the size of the intervals being stacked, different qualities of chords are formed. In popular and jazz harmony, chords are named by their root plus various terms and characters indicating their qualities. To keep the nomenclature as simple as possible, some defaults are accepted (not tabulated here). For example, the chord members C, E, and G, form a C Major triad, called by default simply a C chord. In an A{{music|b}} chord (pronounced A-flat), the members are A{{music|b}}, C, and E{{music|b}}.

In many types of music, notably baroque, romantic, modern and jazz, chords are often augmented with "tensions". A tension is an additional chord member that creates a relatively dissonant interval in relation to the bass. Following the tertian practice of building chords by stacking thirds, the simplest first tension is added to a triad by stacking on top of the existing root, third, and fifth, another third above the fifth, giving a new, potentially dissonant member the interval of a seventh away from the root and therefore called the "seventh" of the chord, and producing a four-note chord, called a "[[seventh chord]]".

Depending on the widths of the individual thirds stacked to build the chord, the interval between the root and the seventh of the chord may be major, minor, or diminished. (The interval of an augmented seventh reproduces the root, and is therefore left out of the chordal nomenclature.) The nomenclature allows that, by default, "C7" indicates a chord with a root, third, fifth, and seventh spelled C, E, G, and B{{music|b}}. Other types of seventh chords must be named more explicitly, such as "C Major 7" (spelled C, E, G, B), "C augmented 7" (here the word augmented applies to the fifth, not the seventh, spelled C, E, G{{music|#}}, B{{music|b}}), etc. (For a more complete exposition of nomenclature see [[Chord (music)]].)

Continuing to stack thirds on top of a seventh chord produces extensions, and brings in the "extended tensions" or "upper tensions" (those more than an octave above the root when stacked in thirds), the ninths, elevenths, and thirteenths. This creates the chords named after them. (Note that except for dyads and triads, tertian chord types are named for the interval of the largest size and magnitude in use in the stack, not for the number of chord members : thus a ninth chord has five members ''[tonic, 3rd, 5th, 7th, '''9'''th]'', not nine.) Extensions beyond the thirteenth reproduce existing chord members and are (usually) left out of the nomenclature. Complex harmonies based on [[extended chord]]s are found in abundance in jazz, late-romantic music, modern orchestral works, film music, etc.

Typically, in the classical [[Common practice period]] a dissonant chord (chord with tension) ''resolves'' to a consonant chord. [[Harmonization]] usually sounds pleasant to the ear when there is a balance between the consonant and dissonant sounds. In simple words, that occurs when there is a balance between "tense" and "relaxed" moments. For this reason, usually tension is 'prepared' and then 'resolved',&lt;ref name=Schejtman&gt;Schejtman, Rod (2008). ''The Piano Encyclopedia's "Music Fundamentals eBook"'', p.20-43 (accessed 10 March 2009) [http://PianoEncyclopedia.com PianoEncyclopedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; where preparing tension means to place a series of consonant chords that lead smoothly to the dissonant chord. In this way the composer ensures introducing tension smoothly, without disturbing the listener.&lt;!--this is a contradiction--&gt; Once the piece reaches its sub-climax, the listener needs a moment of relaxation to clear up the tension, which is obtained by playing a consonant chord that resolves the tension of the previous chords. The clearing of this tension usually sounds pleasant to the listener, though this is not always the case in late-nineteenth century music, such as Tristan und Isolde by Richard Wagner.&lt;ref name="Schejtman"/&gt;

== Perception ==

Harmony is based on consonance, a concept whose definition has changed various times during the history of Western music. In a psychological approach, consonance is a continuous variable. Consonance can vary across a wide range. A chord may sound consonant for various reasons.

One is lack of perceptual roughness. Roughness happens when partials (frequency components) lie within a critical bandwidth, which is a measure of the ear's ability to separate different frequencies. Critical bandwidth lies between 2 and 3 semitones at high frequencies and becomes larger at lower frequencies. The roughness of two simultaneous harmonic complex tones depends on the amplitudes of the harmonics and the interval between the tones. The roughest interval in the chromatic scale is the minor second and its inversion the major seventh. For typical spectral envelopes in the central range, the second roughest interval is the major second and minor seventh, followed by the tritone, the minor third ([[major sixth]]), the major third ([[minor sixth]]) and the perfect fourth (fifth).

[[Image:Major triad.svg|250px|thumb|The harmonious [[Major chord|major triad]] is composed of three tones. Their frequency ratio corresponds approximately 6:5:4. In real performances, however, the third is often larger than 5:4. The ratio 5:4 corresponds to an interval of 386 [[Cent (music)|cents]], but an equally tempered major third is 400 cents and a Pythagorean third with a ratio of 81:64 is 408 cents. Measurements of frequencies in good performances confirm that the size of the major third varies across this range and can even lie outside it without sounding out of tune. Thus, there is no simple connection between frequency ratios and harmonic function.]]

The second reason is perceptual fusion. A chord fuses in perception if its overall spectrum is similar to a [[harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]]. According to this definition a major triad fuses better than a minor triad and a major-minor seventh chord fuses better than a major-major seventh or minor-minor seventh. These differences may not be readily apparent in tempered contexts but can explain why major triads are generally more prevalent than minor triads and major-minor sevenths generally more prevalent than other sevenths (in spite of the dissonance of the tritone interval) in mainstream tonal music. Of course these comparisons depend on style.

The third reason is familiarity. Chords that have often been heard in musical contexts tend to sound more consonant. This principle explains the gradual historical increase in harmonic complexity of Western music. For example, around 1600 unprepared seventh chords gradually became familiar and were therefore gradually perceived as more consonant.

Western music is based on major and minor triads. The reason why these chords are so central is that they are consonant in terms of both fusion and lack of roughness. They fuse because they include the perfect fourth/fifth interval. They lack roughness because they lack major and minor second intervals. No other combination of three tones in the chromatic scale satisfies these criteria.

== Consonance and dissonance in balance ==
Post-nineteenth century music has evolved in the way that tension may be less often prepared and less formally structured than in [[Baroque Music|Baroque]] or [[Classical Music|Classical]] periods, thus producing new styles such as post-Romantic harmony, [[Impressionist music|impressionism]], pantonality, [[jazz]] and [[blues]], where dissonance may not be prepared in the way seen in "common practice era" harmony. In a jazz or blues song, the tonic chord that opens a tune may be a dominant seventh chord. A jazz song may end on what in Classical music is a quite dissonant chord, such as an [[altered dominant]] chord with a sharpened eleventh note.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

'''id - Identity of the Soul''' is a work of performance art produced by 
Martine Rød and directed by [[Thomas Hoegh]]. The first version of this work, Terje, was performed in [[Yokohama]], Japan in 2006 with [[Paal Ritter Schjerven]] as Co-Director and Director of Cinematography. 
and the latest version premiered in Palestine in 2008.  In 2009 the show then toured to [[Doha]], Qatar in May and to the [http://www.teateribsen.no/show_details.asp?ID=1046 Teater Ibsen] in [[Skien]], Norway in June.  The Studio version of id (a smaller, more portable version of the production) had its English premiere at the [[Cambridge Film Festival]] on 17 September 2009 and is currently touring the UK.

Based on Norwegian playwright [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s poem '[[Terje Vigen]]' 
and [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] poet [[Mahmoud Darwish]]'s "A Soldier 
Dreams Of White Lilies"&lt;ref name="alltimeisunredeemable"&gt;[http://alltimeisunredeemable.blogspot.com/2008/11/identity-of-soul.html All Time Is Unredeemable blog]&lt;/ref&gt; 
id is a combination of music and poetry along
with film projected onto five separate screens. The 
soundtrack was composed by Paul Noble and Dan Berridge, and is a fusion 
of traditional Scandinavian and Arabic music with contemporary 
electronic 
rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paulnoble.co.uk/Paul%20Noble%20-%20Radio%20Production,%20Music%20Consultancy,%20Sound%20Engineering./Current%20Projects.html Paul Noble's website, current projects]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56066">There are 230 [[Space group#Table of space groups in 3 dimensions|space groups]] in three dimensions, given by a number index, and a full name in [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]], and a short name (international short symbol). The long names are given with spaces for readability. The groups each have a [[point groups]] of the unit cell.

== Symbols==
In [[Hermann–Mauguin notation]], space groups are named by a symbol combining the [[point group]] identifier with the uppercase letters describing the [[Bravais lattice#Bravais lattices in 3 dimensions|lattice type]]. Translations within the lattice in the form of [[screw axes]] and [[glide planes]] are also noted, giving a complete crystallographic space group.

These are the [[Bravais lattices]] in three dimensions:
*'''P''' primitive
*'''I''' body centered (from the German "Innenzentriert")
*'''F''' face centered (from the German "Flächenzentriert")
*'''A''' centered on A faces only
*'''B''' centered on B faces only
*'''C''' centered on C faces only
*'''R''' rhombohedral

A reflection plane '''m''' within the point groups can be replaced by a [[glide plane]], labeled as '''a''', '''b''', or '''c''' depending on which axis the glide is along. There is also the '''n''' glide, which is a glide along the half of a diagonal of '''a''' face, and the '''d''' glide, which is along a quarter of either a face or space diagonal of the unit cell. The '''d''' glide is often called the diamond glide plane as it features in the [[diamond]] structure.
*&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; glide translation along half the lattice vector of this face
*&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; glide translation along with half a face diagonal
*&lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; glide planes with translation along a quarter of a face diagonal.
*&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; two glides with the same glide plane and translation along two (different) half-lattice vectors.

A gyration point can be replaced by a [[screw axis]] denoted by a number, ''n'', where the angle of rotation is  &lt;math&gt;\color{Black}\tfrac{360^\circ}{n}&lt;/math&gt;. The degree of translation is then added as a subscript showing how far along the axis the translation is, as a portion of the parallel lattice vector.  For example, 2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a 180° (twofold) rotation followed by a translation of ½ of the lattice vector. 3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a 120° (threefold) rotation followed by a translation of ⅓ of the lattice vector.

The possible screw axes are: 2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 3&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 3&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 4&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 4&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 4&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 6&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, and 6&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.

In '''Schoenflies notation''', the symbol of a space group is represented by the symbol of corresponding point group with additional superscript. The superscript doesn't give any additional information about symmetry elements of the space group, but is instead related to the order in which Schoenflies derived the space groups.

In '''Fedorov symbol''', the type of space group is denoted as ''s'' (''symmorphic'' ), ''h'' (''hemisymmorphic''), or ''a'' (''asymmorphic''). The number is related to the order in which Fedorov derived space groups. There are 73 symmorphic, 54 hemisymmorphic, and 103 asymmorphic space groups. Symmorphic space groups can be obtained as combination of Bravais lattices with corresponding point group. These groups contain the same symmetry elements as the corresponding point groups. Hemisymmorphic space groups contain only axial combination of symmetry elements from the corresponding point groups. All the other space groups are asymmorphic. Example for point group 4/mmm (&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{4}{m}\tfrac{2}{m}\tfrac{2}{m}&lt;/math&gt;): the symmorphic space groups are P4/mmm (&lt;math&gt;P\tfrac{4}{m}\tfrac{2}{m}\tfrac{2}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, ''36s'') and I4/mmm (&lt;math&gt;I\tfrac{4}{m}\tfrac{2}{m}\tfrac{2}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, ''37s''); hemisymmorphic space groups should contain axial combination 422, these are P4/mcc (&lt;math&gt;P\tfrac{4}{m}\tfrac{2}{c}\tfrac{2}{c}&lt;/math&gt;, ''35h''), P4/nbm (&lt;math&gt;P\tfrac{4}{n}\tfrac{2}{b}\tfrac{2}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, ''36h''), P4/nnc (&lt;math&gt;P\tfrac{4}{n}\tfrac{2}{n}\tfrac{2}{c}&lt;/math&gt;, ''37h''), and I4/mcm (&lt;math&gt;I\tfrac{4}{m}\tfrac{2}{c}\tfrac{2}{m}&lt;/math&gt;, ''38h'').

'''The Mask and Wig Club''', a [[gentlemen's club|private club]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], founded in 1889, is the oldest all-male collegiate musical comedy troupe in the [[United States]]. Created as an alternative to the existing theatrical and dramatic outlets at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], Mask and Wig has presented comedy, music, and dancing to the University of Pennsylvania, [[Philadelphia]], and audiences across the country. Its credo is "Justice to the stage; credit to the University."&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt;

The club's performers, or "The Cast," put on two all-original shows each year in collaboration with the Club's own Stage Crew, Band, and Business Staff. Many Mask and Wig originals were made famous on the radio by mid 20th century luminaries. The well-known "Route 66" was composed by club member [[Bobby Troup]]&lt;ref&gt;http://media.www.dailypennsylvanian.com/media/storage/paper882/news/1994/02/24/Resources/Still.Laughing-2180040.shtml{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},&lt;/ref&gt; and launched to the height of popularity by [[Frank Sinatra]]. Troup's song "Daddy" was written for a Mask and Wig show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secondhandsongs.com/work/60718|title=Original versions of Daddy written by Bobby Troup -  SecondHandSongs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Mask and Wig songs, such as "[[The Gypsy in My Soul]]," written by [[Clay Boland]] and [[Moe Jaffe]], have been performed by the likes of [[Benny Goodman]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], and [[Ella Fitzgerald]].  The first electrically recorded album ever released was Mask and Wig's "Joan of Arkansas," in April 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philadelphiaencyclopedia.org/archive/recording-industry/|title=Recording Industry - Encyclopedia of Greater Philadelphia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Mask and Wig Club of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] was first conceived of in 1888 by a small group of undergraduates, led by Clayton Fotterall McMichael, who were interested in the stage and desired something the University did not offer: a troupe that would produce original humorous theatrical pieces.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt; In 1889, therefore, McMichael and the other original founders sent out a call for undergraduate men to audition for the group and participate in the creation and production of its first performance.&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/2908635/Some-Fifty-Odd-Years-of-The-Mask-and-Wig-Club-1889-1941|title=Some Fifty Odd Years of The Mask and Wig Club (1889-1941)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMichael and his peers envisioned a group that involved dressing up in frocks and performing spoofs and parodies.  Because colleges at the time were open only to young gentlemen, any production was limited to an all–male cast. These organizations naturally saw burlesque, which was quite popular in that era, as the perfect genre. The overblown characterizations, loose plotting, musical interludes, and parody of high art made the style perfect for a group of young, well-educated, amateur men, especially since the drag tradition came "built-in".&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt;

Founder McMichael combed the local bookstores for a story to produce and found it in Henry Byron's The Nymphs of the Lurleyburg. A substantially altered version, "Lurline", the Club's first production, hit the boards at the Chestnut Street Opera House on June 4, 1889, for one night only. Backed financially by the ladies of Philadelphia high society, the Club enjoyed great success in its early years. With increasingly reliable audience turnout and revenue from ticket sales, the runs were extended and the Club established a fine tradition among Philadelphia's theater–going society.  Moreover, the club made a very strong impression on campus and it achieved great notoriety within its first year of existence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archives.upenn.edu/primdocs/upm/upm7100/1890record.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mask and Wig rehearsal (1930).jpg|thumb|200px|left|Company members rehearsing at the clubhouse in 1930.]]
In 1894 the Club purchased a property at 310 South Quince Street to serve as a gathering place and rehearsal hall, [[the Mask and Wig Clubhouse]].  The building had been erected by the first African-American Lutheran congregation in America as St. Paul's Lutheran Church in 1834, but had been sold in 1839&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/1998-02-22/news/25754844_1_storefront-church-evangelical-lutheran-church-pastor-jones|title=Archives - Philly.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and converted into a coachhouse and stable, and later into a dissecting room for medical students. Prominent Philadelphia architect [[Wilson Eyre]] was commissioned to remodel the building, and hired the young [[Maxfield Parrish]], who would later become one of the greatest illustrators of the 20th century, to decorate the interior. The Grille Room was decorated with caricatures of members, a tradition that continues today, with the second century of members' caricatures continued upstairs at the entrance to the auditorium. Eyre expanded the clubhouse to its present size, 1901-1903.

The Club prospered throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The middle of this century was a heady time for the Club.  Mask and Wig songs were the rage of the big band orchestras, radio shows, and solo acts of the day. The likes of [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Count Basie]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], and [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]] all covered Mask and Wig tunes. Between 1952 and 1958, the club appeared four times on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040053/fullcredits#cast|title=The Ed Sullivan Show|date=20 June 1948|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1961 production, ''Wry on the Rocks'', introduced a satirical revue format in a cabaret atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.maskandwig.com/Annual%20Productions/1961%20Wry%20on%20the%20Rocks/Wry%20on%20the%20Rocks%20-%20Program.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, with ''Myth America'', Mask and Wig returned the student–written book musical to its stage, a practice which continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.maskandwig.com/Annual%20Productions/1992%20Myth%20America/Myth%20America%20-%20Progam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Important in the show's success are the traditional high standards in the caliber of performers and excellence of the material performed. The Club's primary purpose has always been and continues to be, "Justice to the stage; credit to the University."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maskandwig.com/about/|title=About - The Mask and Wig Club|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the end of World War II the Mask and Wig dormitory on the residence quadrangle was used to house a U.S. Army unit assigned to quickly learn the Japanese language.  Upon the completion of the study the soldiers were to be commissioned in the U.S. Army and serve in the Counterintelligence Corps (CIC) of the Army in Japan.  This army unit had classes in the University in the Egyptian Antiquities room while being scrutinized by several mummies.  Classes were also held in the Wharton School of Business.  Jerry Epple, a member of the [[Army Specialized Training Program]], says he remembers to this day the stone carving of a mask and wig near the dormitory entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astpww2.org/main/memoirs_2.htm|title=生理前のオリモノが白いのは異常ですか？意外と知らないオリモノについて|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305040708/http://www.astpww2.org/main/memoirs_2.htm|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Mask and Wig maintains its position as one of the premier extracurricular activities on the Penn campus. Its yearly tour over spring break brings the show to alumni clubs across the nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maskandwig.com/about/tour/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
===Club organization===
The Mask and Wig Club has two components: the Undergraduate Company and the Graduate Club.  The Undergraduate Company is composed of current undergrads at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], who are the performers in and creators of each year's productions.  They are the public face of the organization.

The Graduate Club is composed of Mask and Wig Alumni. The Graduate Club is responsible for many of the decisions that guide the Undergraduate Club, including overseeing many aspects of the production of the Spring Show, and the maintenance of the Clubhouse. They provide much of the funding for the maintenance of the Clubhouse and were responsible for raising the funds for its renovation. The Graduate Club and the Undergraduate Club interface through regular Board of Governors meetings, which feature both Undergraduate and Graduate club members.

===Undergraduate sections===
The Mask and Wig Club is made up of four distinct sections: the cast, the band, the crew, and the business staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perücke – so alt wie die Zivilisation|url=http://www.perücke.biz/peruecke-so-alt-wie-die-zivilisation/|website=Perücke.biz|language=de-DE}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast writes and performs all of its own material during the Fall and Spring Shows.  The band often functions as a pit orchestra, playing original, self-arranged pieces for the Fall show, and professionally arranged pieces for the Spring production.  The band also holds the headliner spot at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s annual Spring Fling festival in the Quad. The crew builds elaborate, ornate, and completely original sets for both the Fall and Spring Shows.  The business staff is responsible for advertising and selling tickets for the club's shows.

==Performances==

===Free Show===
Free Show is the first Mask and Wig show of the academic year.  The show is held during the first week of the academic year and is free of charge to all new freshmen. The cast performs classic bits that are tried and true. Free Show serves a few purposes: it introduces the new freshmen of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] to one of Penn's oldest institutions, and hopes to recruit new members by displaying what membership in the group entails. In 2018, for the first time the Free Show was performed in collaboration with Penn's all-female musical sketch comedy troupe, Bloomers.

===Fall Show===
Each fall, the undergraduates produce their own sketch comedy show that runs for one week in a theater on Penn's campus.  The upperclassmen handle all aspects of production from acting direction to choreography to musical production.  A notable highlight of the show is the Second Act Opener, which consists of a medley of songs from a famous musician or group, but with parodied lyrics that often follow a Penn-centered plot. Past parodied musicians include [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Billy Joel]], [[The Beatles]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Disney]], and [[Queen (band)|Queen]].

===ComFest===
In 1999, Mask and Wig established an annual Intercollegiate Comedy Festival to showcase the talent of the nation's best collegiate sketch comedy troupes. The mission of the festival is not just to put on a hilarious show that cultivates new talent, but also to honor and showcase a well-known comedian. Each host does a stand-up routine for the audience and participates in sketches with Mask and Wig.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maskandwig.org/comfest/history.html{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Past college sketch troupes include:
*[[Princeton Triangle Club]]

===Spring Show===
The Spring Show, historically known as the Annual Production, is the theatrical centerpiece of Mask and Wig.  Performed at [[The Mask and Wig Clubhouse]], the production is an original show that runs from late January to early April.  While the format of the Spring Show has evolved over the years, the show currently runs as a full "book" musical comedy, complete with singing and tap dancing.

Unlike the Fall Show, the Annual Production is professionally composed, directed, and choreographed by some of the best talents in the industry.  The script, however, is written by the Club's cast.

===Tour===
During spring break the troupe takes their show around the country as they road trip across the United States, usually performing in areas with a high Penn alumni concentration.  The trip usually includes about four to six stops.  In recent years the tour has taken Wig to cities like London, [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Chicago]], and [[Toronto]].

The tour is yet another one of the group's many traditions.  In Mask and Wig's heyday, the group had its own train car that it would use to do a similar tour around the nation.

===Spring Fling===
The Mask and Wig Band traditionally headlines the last day of Spring Fling performances, which was historically a Saturday, at the stage in the Lower Quad. In 2018 the festival was moved to [[Penn Park]] along with the Mask and Wig performance.  They generally perform an hour-long set of covers of popular music.  Members of the cast generally sing for the band, along with female vocalists from other Penn performing arts groups.  The other members of the company join the band on stage for the duration of the performance, and the show concludes with the singing of the Mask and Wig hallmark musical number, Tradition, by the senior members of the company.

==The Clubhouse==
===Clubhouse art===
Working in his studio just a few blocks away at Thirteenth and Walnut Streets, [[Maxfield Parrish]] received one of his first commissions in 1894 from Mask and Wig.  This first job came as he was finishing his studies at the [[Pennsylvania Academy]]; it was for decoration of the stage [[proscenium]] and ticket window, illustration of a number of caricatures on the wall of the Grille Room, and most notably the [[Old King Cole]] mural.  This was the start of his professional career; shortly after seeing the mural, the editor of “Harper's” Magazine invited Parrish to do some of their covers for which he became famous.  He would continue working for the Club to finish a total of 35 caricatures and illustrate the earliest program covers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=1077023|title=Christies - Page Not Found|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson Eyre was older and more established than Parrish when he began working on the Clubhouse, and was good friends with Parrish's father, [[Stephen Parrish|Stephen]].  Eyre was the architect in charge of renovating the Club's new home and transforming it from a stable into a “[[Bavaria]]n” themed Clubhouse.  His first remodel in 1894 transformed the space from the stable by adding an entry hall with stairs, designing and decorating the Grille Room, and turning the second floor into a theater.  Eyre designed most of the furniture in the Grille Room; three of the original tables still exist and will be returned to the Clubhouse upon its reopening.  Eyre also oversaw the second major change.  The building was enlarged in 1903 by adding 10 feet to the front creating the façade that still exists there today.  Eyre's original drawing of the front design, created in 1902, is shown to the right.  Eyre's design has endured for over a century with few changes aside from the ongoing addition of paneling for caricatures in the Grille Room and Theater.  Though Eyre's career included several projects like the Clubhouse, he is best known for his design of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]’s Museum.

===Clubhouse renovations===
Immediately following the close of the 2007 Spring show, the clubhouse began to undergo an extensive renovation.  In addition to bringing the building up to modern code, the club also installed an elevator and central air conditioning unit.  The construction, originally projected to be complete in time for a normal Spring show run, experienced a number of delays and setbacks.  On the morning of March 15, 2008, a fire broke out in the attic of the clubhouse, setting back the completion date indefinitely.  While nothing of historical significance was critically damaged, the 2008 Spring show, "West Wing Story", could not go on in the club's signature theater.

Luckily, the club had a contingency plan in case of such an emergency, and was able to put on their show.  "West Wing Story" played for two weekends in April, 2008 at the Prince Music Theater in downtown Philadelphia, marking the first annual production to be performed at a venue other than the clubhouse since 1960.  The generosity of Mask and Wig's Graduate Club made it financially possible to perform in a professional theater.  With renovations still behind schedule in 2009, the annual production "Oh, the Humanities!" was also performed at the Prince Music Theater for three weekends, selling a record number of tickets due to the large theater capacity.

The clubhouse renovation was completed in the fall of 2009, allowing the club to once again return to its own stage for the 2010 Annual Production, "A Cheshire Catastrophe".

[[Image:NOMAD logo.jpg|right|250px]]
'''NOMAD''' was founded in 2002 as an independent formation and registered as association in 2006. It targets to produce and experiment new patterns in the digital art sphere by using various lenses of other disciplines. The core of the formation consists of designers, engineers, architects, curators and writers. The infrastructure is based on technical and theoretical levels to provide collaborations with affiliations of artists. NOMAD's production network aims to build strong connections across territorial borders through digital culture oriented projects. The main goal of these projects is to establish a productive communication channel that enables access to new resources of information. The core development team consists of [[Basak Senova]], Emre Erkal, Erhan Muratoglu.

[[Image:Ctrl_alt_del_logo.jpg|right|250px]]
Project '''[[Project ctrl alt del|ctrl_alt_del]]''' was the first [[sound art]] festival realized in Turkey, in September 2003. It was a collaboration between NOMAD, Marres, Hedah, and [[Istanbul Technical University]] Center for Advanced Musical Studies (MIAM). All through the month of September 2003, several events were realized in two cities, [[Istanbul]] and [[Maastricht]]: (i) an introductory presentation, a CD launch, performances by two artists from the Netherlands and Turkey in Marres (Maastricht); (ii) a panel and workshop series at Istanbul Technical University, Faculty of Architecture and MIAM; (iii) a series of performances in Babylon, Istanbul during the opening of the 8th International [[Istanbul Biennial]]; (iv) a panel, and performance series at Marres; (v) an exhibition at Marres; (vi) an audio CD which was distributed in Europe through Lowlands, and the international distribution of  the CD-ROM was carried out by NOMAD. ctrl_alt_del aimed at introducing Turkey to sound-art via sound-art’s pioneering names, together with panels and workshops. More than 30 people from 16 different countries contributed to the project in 2003.

In 2005, ctrl_alt_del took place in the “positionings” section of the 9th International Istanbul Biennial. The project launched on September 16, 2005 with an opening night performance at Balans Music hall, then continued on the [[Bosphorus]], the [[Golden Horn]], Istanbul Technical University’s MIAM studios, laboratories, library and concert hall till September 22. The 2005 programme for the ctrl_alt_del project has been developed by Basak Senova, Emre Erkal, Erhan Muratoglu, Pieter Snapper, and Paul Devens. Can Karadogan was responsible for the logistics of ITU activities as the project coordinator and Nusin Odelli was in charge of editing of the printed material. 57 people from 12 countries participated in the project.

In 2007, ctrl_alt_del will be realized by NOMAD in coorporation with Istanbul Technical University – MIAM. This year, ctrl_alt_del will include Opening Concert, Performance Series (live), Workshops, Panels, Presentations, Open Call, Field Studies/Workshops, Exhibition, Radio Programmes, Publication and CD release. The theme of ctrl_alt_del 2007 will be “remote [[orienteering]]”. The theme is not only connected to the navigational systems but it is also about positioning oneself within interconnected social and political realities. The theme will also be processed with the issues of control. It will take place parallel to the 10th International Istanbul Biennial in September. The development team consist of Paul Devens (NL), Can Karadogan (TR), Basak Senova (TR), Eran Sachs (DE/IL), Erhan Muratoglu (TR), and Emre Erkal (TR).

'''''O'Flaherty V.C., A Recruiting Pamphlet''''' (1915) is a comic one-act play written during [[World War I]] by [[George Bernard Shaw]]. The plot is about an Irish soldier in the British army returning home after winning the [[Victoria Cross]]. The play was written at a time when the British government was attempting to promote recruitment in Ireland, while many [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]] expressed opposition to a war to defend the British Empire.

==Characters==
*Dennis O'Flaherty, Irish soldier
*Teresa Driscoll, his girlfriend
*Mrs O'Flaherty, his mother
*General Sir Pearce Madigan, his commanding officer

==Plot==
Dennis O'Flaherty, winner of the Victoria Cross for his outstanding bravery, has returned home to his local village to take part in a recruitment campaign. In conversation with General Pearce Madigan, the local squire, O'Flaherty admits that he had not told his Fenian mother that he would be fighting for the British side in the war, not against it. Madigan says he must explain to her why the war is being fought, and that even Republicans should help in the struggle against German oppression. O'Flaherty says he's no idea why the war is being fought, he just joined up to get away from home, but one thing he's become convinced of is that patriotism is part of the problem: "You'll never have a quiet world till you knock the patriotism out of the human race". His mother appears, horrified to discover he's being fighting ''for'' the British. But she's even more horrified when Dennis' girlfriend, Teresa, arrives, expecting that the V.C. comes with a large payout in cash. She's dismayed to learn that the government may only give him a pension if he is wounded first. Still, she thinks it will be worth it, even if he does have to be badly wounded. Dennis says he's sick of life in provincial Ireland. Since he's experienced France, he never wants to come back. He hopes he can get a French wife. Teresa is outraged. When Mrs O'Flaherty discovers that her son gave Teresa a valuable gold watch, she launches into a tirade and the two women berate each other mercilessly. O'Flaherty says he can't wait to get back to the peace and quiet of the trenches. General Madigan sympathises, commenting, "Do you think that we should have got an army without conscription if domestic life had been as happy as people say it is?"

==Preface==
In the preface Shaw argues that most soldiers do not enlist for patriotic reasons, but through a desire for adventure, or to get away from a restricted life. This is especially true of the Irish, since an Irishman's hopes and opportunities depend on "getting out of Ireland". He adds that recruitment was nevertheless at a low ebb in 1915, as it had been "badly bungled... The Irish were for the most part Roman Catholics and loyal Irishmen, which means that from the English point of view they were heretics and rebels." Shaw said that he gave his character a self-serving girlfriend and a harridan of a mother ("a [[Volumnia]] of the potato-patch") in order to emphasise the kind of petty oppression from which poor youths fled to join up.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard, ''Complete Plays: With Prefaces'', Volume: 5., "Dodd, Mead", New York, 1963, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context and productions==
[[File:Michael O'Leary WWI poster.jpg|thumb|150px|A recruiting poster depicting Irish war hero Michael John O'Leary]]
O'Flaherty's exploits in the war and role in recruiting drives are based on those of Irish Catholic Victoria Cross winner [[Michael John O'Leary]].&lt;ref name = bat&gt;Batchelor, Peter F. &amp; Matson, Christopher (1997). ''VCs of the First World War – The Western Front 1915''. Sutton Publishing, pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1915 O'Leary had captured two German barricades, killing the gun crew of the first and capturing the second after running out of ammunition. O'Leary been given a grand reception attended by thousands of Londoners in Hyde Park on 10 July 1915. Recruitment was a highly divisive subject in Ireland at the time. O'Leary was also greeted by cheering crowds in his home town of Macroom, but he was jeered by [[Ulster Volunteers]] at a recruitment drive in Ballaghaderrin during the autumn of 1915. This treatment caused such a scandal that it was raised in the [[Houses of Parliament]] in December.&lt;ref name = bat/&gt; Like O'Flaherty's mother, O'Leary's father was a fervent Irish nationalist.

The play was intended for the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, which was suffering financially in the war, but the play's anti-war message led to a wartime ban on performance by the military authorities in Ireland.&lt;ref name =dic&gt;Broad, Violet &amp; Broad C. Lewis, ''Dictionary to the Plays and Novels of Bernard Shaw'', A. &amp; C. Black, London, 1929, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Bernard Shaw's Suppressed Play," ''Current Opinion'', New York, August, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw later wrote to Yeats that he was not sure that the play would work there anyway, and that [[St John Ervine]], who was to have played the lead role, was not suited to the part.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Welch, ''The Abbey Theatre, 1899–1999: Form and Pressure'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1999, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; The first production was an amateur performance put on by officers of the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in Belgium.&lt;ref name = mrr/&gt; The first professional production was by the [[Incorporated Stage Society]] at the [[Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith]], 20 December 1920. It was paired with [[H. O. Meredith]]'s ''Forerunners''. On 20 November (what year? can't be 1920) Shaw himself gave a radio broadcast version of the play.&lt;ref name = arc&gt;Henderson, Archibald, ''George Bernard Shaw: Man of the Century'', Appleton-Century-Crofts, New York, 1956, p. 572&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical views==
[[Beatrice Webb]] wrote in her diary that "O'Flaherty V.C. is a brilliant but serious piece of work—a jewel of a one-act play."&lt;ref&gt;Margaret I. Cole (ed), ''Beatrice Webb's Diaries, 1912–1924'', Longmans, Green and Co, London, 1952, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Stephen Murray in ''English War Plays of the First World War'', says that "Shaw tackles the issues of the war in a juxtaposition of serious and inconsequential subject-matter and tones which in many ways do take away from the important points he wishes to disclose. These fragment the unity of theme and mood."&lt;ref name = mrr&gt;Murray, Stephen, ''English War Plays of the First World War''&lt;/ref&gt; Shaw's friend [[Archibald Henderson (professor)|Archibald Henderson]] says that "The Irish peasants are portrayed as hopelessly insular and sadly benighted. Their prejudice against the British is bitter and incorrigible."&lt;ref name = arc/&gt; Bernard Dukore notes that the play "vividly contrasts as background the poverty of the lower-class Irish with the prosperity of the landed Anglo-Irish ascendancy. Because O'Flaherty's mother nursed the son of Sir Pearce, she had to bring up her own daughter on the bottle. When Sir Pearce mentions a citizen's obligation to king and country, O'Flaherty comments, 'Well, sir, to you that have an estate in it, it would feel like your country. But the devil a [[Rod (unit)|perch]] of it ever I owned.'"&lt;ref&gt;Bernard F. Dukore, ''Bernard Shaw, Playwright: Aspects of Shavian Drama'', University of Missouri Press, Columbia, MO., 1973, p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Paths of Glory''''' is a 1917 painting by British artist [[Christopher Nevinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27903827|title=The faceless men|date=23 June 2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|author=Allan Little|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title quotes from a line from [[Thomas Gray]]'s poem ''[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]'': "The paths of glory lead but to the grave". It is held by the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London, which describes it as "one of Nevinson's most famous paintings".&lt;ref name=IWMPaths&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/20211|title=Search the Collection;- ''Paths of Glory'' |year=|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=[[Imperial War Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCHistoryPaths&gt;{{cite web |author=Imperial War Museum|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/trail/wars_conflict/art/art_daily_life_04.shtml |title=''Paths of Glory'' by CRW Nevinson |date=4 April 2005|accessdate=3 February 2015|work=BBC History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Nevinson had served as a volunteer ambulance driver with the [[Friends' Ambulance Service]] on the Western Front in the early months of the First World War, from November 1914 to January 1915, and then returned to England.  He served as an orderly in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] in London but was invalided out in late 1915 due to [[rheumatic fever]]. During this period he painted several paintings such as ''[[La Mitrailleuse]]'' (1915) and ''The Doctor'' (1916).

He was commissioned as a [[war artist]] in 1917 and was sent to France by the British [[War Propaganda Bureau]].  He adopted a [[Realism (arts)|Realist]] style to depict the horror of the war, moved decisively away from his earlier [[Modernist]] and [[Vorticist]] styles.  

==Painting==
The painting measures {{convert|45.7|xx|60.9|cm|in}}. It depicts two dead British soldiers, face down in a battlefield on the Western Front.  They lie unburied in a muddy landscape that is bare save for barriers of barbed wire and the detritus of war.  

The painting was censored by the official censor of paintings and drawings in France, Lieutenant Colonel [[A N Lee]], on the grounds that displaying dead bodies would hinder the war effort. Nonetheless, Nevinson included the painting in his official exhibition at the [[Leicester Galleries]] in March 1918, but the work was displayed with a brown paper strip across the bodies bearing the word "censored".&lt;ref name="DBHcrisis"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David Boyd Haycock]]|publisher=Old Street Publishing (London)|year=2009|title=A Crisis of Brilliance: Five Young British Artists and the Great War|ISBN=978-1-905847-84-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevinson was reprimanded by the [[War Office]] for exhibiting a censored image, and for using the word "censored" in public without authorisation, but obtained significant publicity, particularly as the first exhibition of official colour tinted photographs from the front (including images of actual dead bodies) opened on 4 March.  The painting was bought by the Imperial War Museum direct from the exhibition, as the work had been commissioned by the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].

The same title was used for several books and the [[Paths of Glory|1957 war film]] directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]].

'''Patina''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|æ|t|ᵻ|n|ə}} or {{IPAc-en|p|ə|ˈ|t|iː|n|ə}}) is a thin layer that variously forms on the surface of [[copper]], [[bronze]] and similar [[metals]] ([[tarnish]] produced by oxidation or other chemical processes), or certain [[stone|stones]], &lt;ref name="AssemblyPřikryl2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=European Geosciences Union.

Additionally, leather aficionados use the term to describe the ageing of high quality leather. The patina on leather goods are unique to the type of leather, frequency of use, and exposure. 

Patinas can provide a protective covering to materials that would otherwise be damaged by corrosion or weathering. They may also be aesthetically appealing.

==Usage==
On metal, patina is a coating of various chemical compounds such as [[oxide]]s, [[carbonate]]s, [[sulfide]]s, or [[sulfate]]s formed on the surface during exposure to atmospheric elements ([[oxygen]], [[rain]], [[acid rain]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[sulfur]]-bearing compounds), a common example of which is rust which forms on iron or steel when exposed to oxygen. Patina also refers to accumulated changes in surface texture and colour that result from normal use of an object such as a [[coin]] or a piece of furniture over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aboutcoppersinks.org/ |title= Finish issues with regard to copper sinks |date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Archaeologist]]s also use the term ''"patina''" to refer to a [[corticate]]d layer that develops over time that is due to a range of complex factors on [[flint]] tools and ancient stone monuments.&lt;ref name="AssemblyPřikryl2007"/&gt; This has led stone tool analysts in recent times to generally prefer the term ''"cortification"'' as a better term to describe the process than ''"patination"''.&lt;ref name="Edmonds1997"&gt;{{cite book |last=Edmonds |first=Mark |title=Stone Tools and Society: Working Stone in Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFxCq5Ez77UC&amp;pg=PA192 |accessdate=26 September 2012 |date=2 June 1997 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-21449-0 |pages=192–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[geology]] and [[geomorphology]], the term ''"patina''" is used to refer to discolored film or thin outer layer produced either on or within the surface of a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] or other material by either the development of a [[weathering rind]] within the surface of a rock, the formation of  [[desert varnish]] on the surface of a rock, or combination of both. It also refers to development as the result of weathering of a case-hardened layer, called ''"cortex''" by geologists, within the surface of either a flint or [[chert]] [[Nodule (geology)|nodule]].&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"&gt;Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P.

==Etymology==
The word "patina" comes from the Latin for "shallow dish". Figuratively, ''patina'' can refer to any fading, darkening or other signs of age, which are felt to be natural or unavoidable (or both).

The chemical process by which a patina forms or is deliberately induced is called patination, and a work of art coated by a patina is said to be patinated.

In industrial and urban air environments containing sulfurous [[acid rain]] from coal-fired power plants or industrial processes, the final patina is primarily composed of sulphide or sulphate compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Berg |first=Jan |title=Why did we paint the library's roof? |url=http://www.deforest.lib.wi.us/FAQS.htm |accessdate=2007-09-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625065039/http://www.deforest.lib.wi.us/FAQS.htm |archivedate=2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Architectural considerations; Copper in Architecture Design Handbook, http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/fundamentals/arch_considerations.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Larry E.

A patina layer takes many years to develop under natural weathering. Buildings in damp coastal/marine environments will develop patina layers faster than ones in dry inland areas.

Facade cladding ([[copper cladding]]; [[Copper in architecture#Wall cladding|copper wall cladding]]) with alloys of copper, e.g. brass or bronze, will weather differently from "pure" copper cladding. Even a lasting gold colour is possible with copper-alloy cladding, for example [[Colston Hall]] in Bristol, or the [[Novotel]] at Paddington Central, London.

Often, antique and well-used firearms will develop a patina on the steel after the [[bluing (steel)|bluing]], [[parkerizing]], or other finish has worn. Firearms in this state are generally considered more valuable than ones that have been re-blued or parkerized. The patina protects the firearm from the more damaging rust that would occur were the patina to be polished off.

==Applied patina==
{{See also|Copper in architecture#Finishes}}
Artists and metalworkers often deliberately add patinas as a part of the original design and decoration of art and furniture, or to simulate antiquity in newly made objects.  The process is often called [[distressing]].

A wide range of chemicals, both household and commercial, can give a variety of patinas. They are often used by artists as surface embellishments either for color, texture, or both. Patination composition varies with the reacted elements and these will determine the color of the patina. For copper alloys, such as bronze, exposure to chlorides leads to green, while sulfur compounds (such as "[[liver of sulfur]]") tend to brown. The basic palette for patinas on copper alloys includes chemicals like [[ammonium sulfide]] (blue-black), liver of sulfur (brown-black), [[cupric nitrate]] (blue-green) and [[ferric nitrate]] (yellow-brown). For artworks, patination is often deliberately accelerated by applying chemicals with heat. Colors range from matte sandstone yellow to deep blues, greens, whites, reds and various blacks. Some patina colors are achieved by the mixing of colors from the reaction with the metal surface with pigments added to the chemicals.  Sometimes the surface is enhanced by waxing, oiling, or other types of lacquers or clear-coats.  More simply, the French sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] used to instruct assistants at his studio to urinate over bronzes stored in the outside yard.  A patina can be produced on copper by the application of vinegar ([[acetic acid]]). This patina is water-soluble and will not last on the outside of a building like a "true" patina. It is usually used as pigment.

Patina is also found on [[slip ring]]s and [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]]s. This type of patina is formed by corrosion, what elements the air might hold, residue from the wear of the carbon brush and moisture; thus, the patina needs special conditions to work as intended.

Patinas can also be found in woks or other metal baking dishes, which form when properly seasoned. The patina on a wok is a dark coating of oils that have been burned onto it to prevent food sticking and to enhance the flavor of the foods cooked in it. Steaming foods or using soap on a wok or other dishware could damage the patina and possibly allow rust.

Knife collectors that own carbon steel blades sometimes force a patina onto the blade to help protect it and give it a more personalized look. This can be done using various chemicals and substances such as muriatic acid, apple cider vinegar, or mustard. It can also be done by sticking the blade into any acidic vegetable or fruit such as an orange or an apple.

==Repatination==
In the case of antiques, a range of views are held on the value of patination and its replacement if damaged, known as repatination.

Preserving a piece's look and character is important and removal or reduction may dramatically reduce its value. If patination has flaked off, repatination may be recommended.&lt;ref name="Gaffney"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/fts/lasvegas_200706A35.html |title=What "Patina" Really Means |last=Gaffney |first=Dennis |date=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appraiser Reyne Haines notes that a repatinated metal piece will be worth more than one with major imperfections in the patina, but less than a piece still with its original finish.&lt;ref name=Gaffney/&gt;

'''''The Piano Lesson''''' depicts the living room of [[Henri Matisse]]{{'}}s home in [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]], with his elder son, [[Pierre Matisse|Pierre]], at the piano, the artist's sculpture ''Decorative Figure'' (1908), at bottom left, and, at upper right, his painting ''[[Woman on a High Stool]]''. Matisse began with a naturalistic drawing, but he eliminated detail as he worked, scraping down areas and rebuilding them broad fields of color. The painting evokes a specific moment in time—light suddenly turned on in a darkening interior—by the triangle of shadow on the boy's face and the rhyming green triangle of light falling on the garden. The artist's incising on the window frame and stippling on the left side produce a pitted quality that suggests the eroding effects of light or time, a theme reiterated by the presence of the metronome and burning candle on the piano.&lt;ref&gt;"MoMA | The Collection | Henri Matisse.

The '''PostClassical Ensemble''' is a [[classical music]] [[musical ensemble]] from [[Washington, D.C.]]. The organization was founded by conductor [[Angel Gil-Ordoñez]] and music historian [[Joseph Horowitz]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=BaltimoreSun&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/bs-mtblog-2011-01-innovation_rewarded_postclassi-story.html |title=Innovation rewarded: Post-Classical Ensemble receives $200,000 Mellon grant | work=Baltimore Sun | author= Tim Smith|date=4 January 2011 | accessdate=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
For the first period of its history, the PCE performed in a variety of locations in the Washington, D.C. area. The ensemble debuted in 2005 with a performance of “Celebrating Don Quixote,” featuring a commissioned production of [[Manuel de Falla]]’s puppet opera Master Peter’s Puppet Show, along with rarely heard works by [[Oscar Espla]] and [[Roberto Gerhard]]. In the 2000s, the ensemble received a $200,000 grant from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]].

In 2016, PCE's presentation of three American documentaries;  “The Plow that Broke the Plains,” “The River,” and “The City,” with original scores by [[Virgil Thomson]] generated two [[Naxos Records|Naxos]] DVDs. Its release of a newly recorded score for the Mexican docu-film Redes received a strongly positive view from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-kenny-20160505-snap-story.html |title=Newly recorded score is highlight of Mexican neo-doc 'Redes' | work=Los Angeles Times | author=Kenneth Turan | date=2016-05-05 | accessdate=2016-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its festival honoring the works of [[Bernard Hermann]] was praised by several U.S. music critics for highlighting Hermann's works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://wamu.org/news/16/04/15/herrmann_festival|title='Psycho' And So Much More: Composer Bernard Herrmann Gets A D.C.

'''Read with Me''' is a reading promotion project in [[Iran]] for disadvantaged children in marginal areas of big cities and those living in remote and deprived areas of the country. The project is designed and implemented by the Institute for Research on the History of Children’s Literature in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Page|first=Liz|date=2016-06-28|title=Focus IBBY|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/621993|journal=Bookbird: A Journal of International Children's Literature|volume=54|issue=3|pages=83–92|doi=10.1353/bkb.2016.0099|issn=1918-6983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Read with Me was started as a pilot project in 2010 in a marginal area of south-east [[Tehran]] close to brick kilns where some 120 Afghan families lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibby.org/awards-activities/activities/sharjah-ibby-fund/iran-sharjahibby-fund/?L=3|title=Iran - Sharjah / IBBY Fund: IBBY official website|website=www.ibby.org|language=es|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since, the project has been expanded to 19 provinces in Iran covering over 60,000 children and young adults and more than 2500 teachers, preschool tutors or volunteers. The project is funded by donations and mainly run by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usbby.org/list_asahi.html|title=USBBY - IBBY-Asahi Reading Promotion Award|website=www.usbby.org|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a group of tutors from [[Mazar-i-Sharif|Mazar-e-Sharif]], [[Afghanistan]] joined the project covering about 1000 children in this city and nearby villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://khanak.org/en/read-with-me-second-phase-in-mazar-e-sharif/|title="Read with Me" starts the new school year in Mazar-e-Sharif with motivation! {{!}} Read with Me|website=khanak.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Course of Action ==
Quality books suitable for children, based on their age-group, literacy level, cultural and social condition, are selected and packed in book-bags. In every package or bag, there are handbooks for the teachers or interested parents to guide them. Two-day training workshops are organized every 3 months for teachers, librarians, and volunteers.

Reading aloud sessions are held in classes. Teachers encourage discussion and exchange of views about the story, aiming to develop critical thinking. Reading sessions are accompanied by related art and craft activities, with an emphasis on role-playing and drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://publishingperspectives.com/2016/04/winners-hans-christian-andersen-asahi-reading|title=At Bologna: Winners in the Hans Christian Andersen &amp; Asahi Awards|date=2016-04-05|work=Publishing Perspectives|access-date=2017-05-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; To monitor and improve the implementation, all activities are documented for further evaluation of the project.

The project has achieved to establish a system that motivates children to read&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/shimbun/award/ibby/2016e.html#RWM|title=IBBY-Asahi Reading Promotion Award: The Asahi Shimbun|last=Company|first=The Asahi Shimbun|website=www.asahi.com|language=ja|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of '''Roman sculpture''' is complicated by its relation to [[Sculpture of Ancient Greece|Greek sculpture]]. Many examples of even the most famous Greek sculptures, such as the [[Apollo Belvedere]] and [[Barberini Faun]], are known only from [[Roman Empire|Roman Imperial]] or [[Hellenistic]] "copies". At one time, this imitation was taken by [[art historian]]s as indicating a narrowness of the Roman artistic imagination, but, in the late 20th century, Roman art began to be reevaluated on its own terms: some impressions of the nature of Greek sculpture may in fact be based on Roman artistry.

The strengths of Roman sculpture are in portraiture, where they were less concerned with the ideal than the Greeks or Ancient Egyptians, and produced very characterful works, and in narrative relief scenes.  Examples of Roman sculpture are abundantly preserved, in total contrast to Roman painting, which was very widely practiced but has almost all been lost. [[Latin literature|Latin]] and some [[ancient Greek literature|Greek authors]], particularly [[Pliny the Elder]] in Book 34 of his ''[[Naturalis Historia|Natural History]]'', describe statues, and a few of these descriptions match extant works. While a great deal of Roman sculpture, especially in stone, survives more or less intact, it is often damaged or fragmentary; life-size [[bronze]] statues are much more rare as most have been recycled for their metal.&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, 94–95&lt;/ref&gt;

Most statues were actually far more lifelike and often brightly colored when originally created; the raw stone surfaces found today is due to the pigment being lost over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/true-colors-17888/?all&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

Early Roman art was influenced by the art of Greece and that of the neighbouring [[Etruscan art|Etruscans]], themselves greatly influenced by their Greek trading partners. An Etruscan speciality was near life size tomb effigies in [[terracotta]], usually lying on top of a [[sarcophagus]] lid propped up on one elbow in the pose of a diner in that period. As the expanding [[Roman Republic]] began to conquer Greek territory, at first in Southern Italy and then the entire Hellenistic world except for the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] far east, official and [[Roman patrician|patrician]] sculpture became largely an extension of the Hellenistic style, from which specifically Roman elements are hard to disentangle, especially as so much Greek sculpture survives only in copies of the Roman period.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 58–63; Hennig, 66–69&lt;/ref&gt; By the 2nd century BCE, "most of the sculptors working at Rome" were Greek,&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, 24&lt;/ref&gt; often enslaved in conquests such as that of [[Corinth]] (146 BCE), and sculptors continued to be mostly Greeks, often slaves, whose names are very rarely recorded. Vast numbers of Greek statues were imported to Rome, whether as booty or the result of extortion or commerce, and temples were often decorated with re-used Greek works.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 66–69; Strong, 36–39, 48; At the trial of [[Verres]], former governor of [[Sicily]], [[Cicero]]'s prosecution details his depredations of art collections at great length.&lt;/ref&gt;

A native Italian style can be seen in the tomb monuments of prosperous middle-class Romans, which very often featured portrait busts, and [[Roman portraiture|portraiture]] is arguably the main strength of Roman sculpture. There are no survivals from the tradition of masks of ancestors that were worn in processions at the funerals of the great families and otherwise displayed in the home, but many of the busts that survive must represent ancestral figures, perhaps from the large family tombs like the [[Tomb of the Scipios]] or the later mausolea outside the city. The famous "[[Capitoline Brutus]]", a bronze head supposedly of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] is very variously dated, but taken as a very rare survival of Italic style under the Republic, in the preferred medium of bronze.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 23–24; Strong, 47&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly stern and forceful heads are seen in the coins of the consuls, and in the Imperial period coins as well as busts sent around the Empire to be placed in the [[basilica]]s of provincial cities were the main visual form of imperial propaganda; even [[Londinium]] had a near-colossal statue of [[Nero]], though far smaller than the 30 metre high [[Colossus of Nero]] in Rome, now lost.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 66–71&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker]], a successful [[freedman]] (c. 50–20 BC) has a [[frieze]] that is an unusually large example of the "plebeian" style.&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, 66; Strong, 125&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Luk Konstantyna 6DSCF0032.JPG|thumb|[[Arch of Constantine]], 315: [[Hadrian]] lion-hunting (left) and sacrificing (right), above a section of the Constantinian frieze, showing the contrast of styles.]]

The Romans did not generally attempt to compete with free-standing Greek works of heroic exploits from history or mythology, but from early on produced historical works in [[relief]], culminating in the great [[Roman triumphal column]]s with continuous narrative reliefs winding around them, of which those commemorating [[Trajan's Column|Trajan]] (CE 113) and [[Column of Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius]] (by 193) survive in Rome, where the [[Ara Pacis]] ("Altar of Peace", 13 BCE) represents the official Greco-Roman style at its most classical and refined.  Among other major examples are the earlier re-used reliefs on the [[Arch of Constantine]] and the base of the [[Column of Antoninus Pius]] (161),&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 73–82;Strong, 48–52, 80–83, 108–117, 128–132, 141–159, 177–182, 197–211&lt;/ref&gt; [[Campana relief]]s were cheaper pottery versions of marble reliefs and the taste for relief was from the imperial period expanded to the sarcophagus.

All forms of luxury small sculpture continued to be patronized, and quality could be extremely high, as in the silver [[Warren Cup]], glass [[Lycurgus Cup]], and large cameos like the [[Gemma Augustea]], [[Gonzaga Cameo]] and the "[[Great Cameo of France]]".&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Chapter 6; Strong, 303–315&lt;/ref&gt;  For a much wider section of the population, moulded relief decoration of [[Ancient Roman pottery|pottery vessels]] and small figurines were produced in great quantity and often considerable quality.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving through a late 2nd century "baroque" phase,&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 171–176, 211–214&lt;/ref&gt; in the 3rd century, Roman art largely abandoned, or simply became unable to produce, sculpture in the classical tradition, a change whose causes remain much discussed. Even the most important imperial monuments now showed stumpy, large-eyed figures in a harsh frontal style, in simple compositions emphasizing power at the expense of grace.  The contrast is famously illustrated in the [[Arch of Constantine]] of 315 in Rome, which combines sections in the new style with [[roundel]]s in the earlier full Greco-Roman style taken from elsewhere, and the ''[[Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs|Four Tetrarchs]]'' (c. 305) from the new capital of [[Constantinople]], now in [[Venice]]. [[Ernst Kitzinger]] found in both monuments the same "stubby proportions, angular movements, an ordering of parts through symmetry and repetition and a rendering of features and drapery folds through incisions rather than modelling... The hallmark of the style wherever it appears consists of an emphatic hardness, heaviness and angularity — in short, an almost complete rejection of the classical tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger, 9 (both quotes), more generally his Ch 1; Strong, 250–257, 264–266, 272–280; also on the Arch of Constantine, Elsner, 98–101&lt;/ref&gt;

This revolution in style shortly preceded the period in which [[Christianity]] was adopted by the Roman state and the great majority of the people, leading to the end of large religious sculpture, with large statues now only used for emperors, as in the famous fragments of a colossal [[acrolithic]] [[Colossus of Constantine|statue of Constantine]], and the 4th or 5th century [[Colossus of Barletta]].  However rich Christians continued to commission reliefs for sarcophagi, as in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]], and very small sculpture, especially in ivory, was continued by Christians, building on the style of the [[consular diptych]].&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 287–291, 305–308, 315–318; Henig, 234–240&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Roman portraiture}}
[[Portrait]]ure is a dominant genre of Roman sculpture, growing perhaps from the [[mos maiorum|traditional Roman emphasis]] on family and ancestors; the entrance hall ''([[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]])'' of a [[domus|Roman elite house]] displayed ancestral [[portrait bust]]s. During the [[Roman Republic]], it was considered [[Roman virtues|a sign of character]] not to gloss over physical imperfections, and to depict men in particular as rugged and unconcerned with vanity: the portrait was a map of experience. During the Imperial era, more idealized statues of [[Roman emperor]]s became ubiquitous, particularly in connection with [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|the state religion of Rome]]. [[Tombstone]]s of even the modestly rich middle class sometimes exhibit portraits of the otherwise unknown deceased carved in [[relief]].

Among the many museums with examples of Roman portrait sculpture, the collections of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] and the [[British Museum]] in [[London]] are especially noteworthy.

==Religious and funerary art==
{{further information|Early Christian sarcophagi}}
[[Religious art]] was also a major form of Roman sculpture. A central feature of a [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman temple]] was the cult statue of the deity, who was regarded as "housed" there (see ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#aedes|aedes]]''). Although images of deities were also displayed in private gardens and parks, the most magnificent of the surviving statues appear to have been cult images. [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#ara|Roman altars]] were usually rather modest and plain, but some Imperial examples are modeled after Greek practice with elaborate reliefs, most famously the [[Ara Pacis]], which has been called "the most representative work of [[Augustus|Augustan]] art."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Galinsky, ''Augustan Culture: An Interpretive Introduction'' (Princeton University Press, 1996), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Small bronze statuettes and ceramic figurines, executed with varying degrees of artistic competence, are plentiful in the archaeological record, particularly in the [[Roman province|provinces]], and indicate that these were a continual presence in the lives of Romans, whether for [[votive]]s or for private devotional display at home or in neighborhood shrines.  These typically show more regional variation in style than large and more official works, and also stylistic preferences between different classes.&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, 95–96&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Roman sarcophagi|Roman marble sarcophagi]] mostly date from the 2nd to the 4th century CE,&lt;ref&gt;The [[Sarcophagus of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus]] is a rare example from much earlier&lt;/ref&gt; after a change in [[Roman burial custom]]s from [[cremation]] to [[inhumation]], and were mostly made in a few major cities, including Rome and [[Athens]], which exported them to other cities. Elsewhere the [[stela]] gravestone remained more common.  They were always a very expensive form reserved for the elite, and especially so in the relatively few very elaborately carved examples; most were always relatively plain, with inscriptions, or symbols such as garlands.  Sarcophagi divide into a number of styles, by the producing area. "Roman" ones were made to rest against a wall, and one side was left uncarved, while "Attic" and other types were carved on all four sides; but the short sides were generally less elaborately decorated in both types.&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, 93–94&lt;/ref&gt; 

The time taken to make them encouraged the use of standard subjects, to which inscriptions might be added to personalize them, and portraits of the deceased were slow to appear.  The sarcophagi offer examples of intricate reliefs that depict scenes often based on [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]] or [[mystery religions]] that offered personal salvation, and [[allegory|allegorical]] representations. Roman [[funerary art]] also offers a variety of scenes from everyday life, such as game-playing, hunting, and military endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Early Christian art]] quickly adopted the sarcophagus, and they are the most common form of early Christian sculpture, progressing from simple examples with symbols to elaborate fronts, often with small scenes of the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] in two rows within an architectural framework. The [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] (c. 359) is of this type, asnd the earlier [[Dogmatic Sarcophagus]] rather simpler. The huge [[porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] [[Sarcophagi of Helena and Constantina]] are grand Imperial examples.

==Gardens and baths==
[[Image:0 Galata Morente - Musei Capitolini (1).jpg|thumb|The [[Dying Gaul]], [[Capitoline Museum]], copy of Hellenistic original]]
[[:Category:Hellenistic and Roman sculptural vases|A number of well-known large stone vases]] sculpted in relief from the Imperial period were apparently mostly used as garden ornaments; indeed many statues were also placed in gardens, both public and private.  Sculptures recovered from the site of the [[Gardens of Sallust]], opened to the public by [[Tiberius]], include:

*the ''Obelisco Sallustiano'', a Roman copy of an Egyptian [[obelisk]] which now stands in front of the [[Trinità dei Monti]] church above the [[Piazza di Spagna]] at the top of the [[Spanish Steps]]
*the [[Borghese Vase]], discovered there in the 16th century.
*the sculptures known as the ''[[Dying Gaul]]'' and the ''[[Ludovisi Gaul|Gaul Killing Himself and His Wife]]'', marble copies of parts a famous Hellenistic group in bronze commissioned for [[Pergamon]] in about 228 BC.
*the [[Ludovisi Throne]] (probably an authentic Greek piece in the [[Severe style]]), found in 1887, and the [[Boston Throne]], found in 1894.
*the ''Crouching Amazon'', found in 1888 near the via Boncompagni, about twenty-five meters from the via Quintino Sella (Museo Conservatori).

[[Roman baths]] were another site for sculpture; among the well-known pieces recovered from the [[Baths of Caracalla]] are the ''[[Farnese Bull]]'' and ''[[Farnese Hercules]]'' and over life-size early 3rd century patriotic figures somewhat reminiscent of Soviet [[Social Realist]] works (now in the [[Museo di Capodimonte]], [[Naples]]).

==Technology==
[[File:047 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel XLVII (Ausschnitt 02).jpg|thumb|Detail from [[Trajan's column]] with [[ballista]]]]
[[Image:Roman harvester, Trier.jpg|thumb|Roman harvesting machine from [[Trier]] ([[Germany]]), a city of the Roman province [[Gallia Belgica]]]]

Scenes shown on reliefs such as that of [[Trajan's column]] and those shown on sarcophogi reveal images of Roman technology now long lost, such as [[ballistae]] and the use of waterwheel-driven saws for cutting stone. The latter was only recently discovered at [[Hieropolis]] and commemorates the miller who used the machine. Other reliefs show harvesting machines, much as they were described by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his [[Naturalis Historia]].

==Architecture==
Compared to the Greeks, the Romans made less use of stone sculpture on buildings, apparently having few [[frieze]]s with figures.  Important [[pediment]]s, such as the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] for example, originally had sculpture, but hardly any have survived. [[Terracotta]] [[relief]] panels called [[Campana relief]]s have survived in good numbers.  These were used to decorate interior walls, in strips.

The architectural writer [[Vitruvius]] is oddly reticent on the architectural use of sculpture, mentioning only a few examples, though he says that an architect should be able to explain the meaning of architectural ornament and gives as an example the use of [[caryatid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, ''Prayers in Stone: Greek Architectural Sculpture ca. 600-100 B.C.E.'' (University of California Press, 1999), pp. 13–14 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6TtwF76TmZsC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=%22the+earliest+compilation%22+intitle:Prayers+intitle:in+intitle:stone&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E2nITMKAHoXhnQfNmcCnAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20earliest%20compilation%22%20intitle%3APrayers%20intitle%3Ain%20intitle%3Astone&amp;f=false online] and 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1396">A '''sail switch''', '''vane switch''' or '''flow switch''' is a [[Machine|mechanical]] switch that is switched on or off in response to the flow or non-flow of a [[fluid]] such as air or water. A sail switch typically operates through the use of a [[paddle]] which gets displaced due to the force of fluid moving past it. Sail switches find application in the detection of fluid flow and measurement of [[Mechanical fan|fan]] speeds. A sail switch might be used to protect a central heating system electric heating element from being energized before the air flow from the blower is established.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appliedgmc.com/images/suburban_ntseries_furnace.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Sail switches might also be used to alarm if a ventilation fan in a hazardous location fails and air flow has stopped.   For some HVAC systems, a sail switch can activate an electronic air cleaner, a humidifier, or other equipment in response to airflow from the system fan.&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.electronicaircleaners.com/honeywell_s688_product_data.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electronicaircleaners.com/s688a1007.aspx|title=Honeywell S688A1007 Sail Switch SPDT|author=|date=|work=Bel-Aire|accessdate=20 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sinap Castle''' is a medieval Armenian fortification in [[Çamlıyayla]] district of [[Mersin Province]] in southern [[Turkey]].

==Geography==
The castle is in the [[Toros Mountains]] at {{coord|37|11|N|34|37|E}}. It is situated to the northeast of Çamlıyayla and to the north of [[Mersin]]. The distance to Çamlıyayla is {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} and to Mersin is {{convert|93|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} stabilized road to the castle diverges from the Mersin-Çamlıyayla highway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.camliyayla33.com/sayfa_goster.php?page_id=173 Çamlıyayla page {{tr icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Its altitude is {{convert|1240|m|ft|abbr=on}}. But it is not particularly high with respect to immediate surroundings.

==History==
The castle functioned as both a fortified estate house and a guardian along the strategic route between the Het‛umid castle at [[Lampron]] (''Namrun Kalesi'') and the Cilician Gates.&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.| title=The Fortifications of Armenian Cilicia: Dumbarton Oaks Studies XXIII | date=1987|publisher=Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University| location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=0-88402-163-7|pages=231–233, 285, pls.206a-210b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was one of the many dozens of fortifications within the medieval [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].  The fort of Sinap is located approximately six kilometers northeast of [[Lampron]] on the gentle slope of a partially forested agricultural valley.  The name ''Sinap'' means "corner" in old Turkish.

==Building==
This three-story high structure has a simple rectangular plan with solid cylindrical towers an each corner.  It was built between the 12th and 14th centuries with the typical rusticated ashlar masonry of the Armenians.&lt;ref name=edwards /&gt;  The lower floor, which is covered by a partially collapsed pointed vault, has no openings except for one door in the west wall.  A now missing staircase once led to the second level which also has a partially preserved vault.  Its walls are opened by nine beautifully designed casemates with embrasured loopholes, two windows, and an apse (?) in the east wall.  The third level, which undoubtedly had fighting platforms (perhaps with merlons), is destroyed.

'''Situ Panchen''' (full name '''Situ Panchen Chögyi Jungney''') (1700&amp;ndash;1774), also known as the 8th [[Tai Situ Rinpoche]], was an influential [[Tibet]]an painter, writer and medical innovator as well as a notable figure in the histories of [[Karma Kagyu]] and the [[Kingdom of Dêgê]], where he served as senior court chaplain.&lt;ref name=Rubin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rmanyc.org/programs-events/situ-panchen.xml?context=programs-events/situ-panchen.xml |title=Situ Panchen: Creation and Cultural Engagement in 18th-Century Tibet |publisher=Rubin Museum of Art |accessdate=2009-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131155038/http://rmanyc.org/programs-events/situ-panchen.xml?context=programs-events%2Fsitu-panchen.xml |archivedate=January 31, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The birth of the eighth Situpa, Chokyi Jungne, was recorded in many texts and literatures, and many great masters made the prophecies of his arrival. For example, the 11th [[Karmapa]], Yeshe Dorje, ever predicted the place where Chokyi Jungne was born.

The eighth Kenting Tai Situpa, Chokyi Jungne (1700–1774), was born in the province of A-Lo Shega at Atarong as the prophecy. His father was Ngawang Tsering and his mother Tranguma.

When Chokyi Jungne was born, lama Kunchen, a master of the Treasure Transmission Lineage, performed Dorje Drolo ceremony for him and gave him the name "Gonpo Sun".

At the age of two, lama Kunchen took him to [[Tsurphu monastery]] to see the 11th [[Karmapa]]. The Karmapa gave lama Kunchen a silk bag full of big black pills, a pearl with no eye, and a prophecy letter written "Situ, the golden dragon, born at A-Lo". The 11th Karmapa asked lama Kunchen to offer all these to the incarnation of Kenting Tai Situpa. Chokyi Jungne in consequence was recognized to be the incarnation of the 7th Kenting Tai Situpa.

At the age of five, Chokyi Jungne began to learn to read and write Tibetan from his father, and performed a Vajravarahi (Dorje pagmo, Vajra Yogini) ceremony taught by lama Kunchen.

At the age of seven, the eighth Shamar Chokyi Dondrup conferred a longevity prayer on him, and conferred the name "Situ Chokyi Jungne Trinley Kunkyab Palzangpo".

At the age of eight, Chokyi Jungne visited the 12th Karmapa Changchub Dorje.

At the age of nine, Chokyi Jungne suffered from a serious illness because one relative of his father put poison in his food for sake of jealousy. Two months later, he was on the mend, but he still could not stand or just sit. He lay on the bed and read twice all the literatures in Paljor monastery. At the same time, Chokyi Jungne also learned five knowledge, India local language and Sanskrit. He could communicate with people precisely and fluently in Chinese, Sanskrit, or Mongol. Only a little teaching, he could become skillful in all kind of painting, carving... etc., even better than those who learned these skills for their whole lives. In short, Chokyi Jungne became famous as "thorough knowledge".

At the age of 14, he was recognized according to predictions left by Karmapa Mikyo Dorje, by Terton Sangye Lingpa, Takshampa Mingyur Dorje and by the eighth Shamar Chokyi Dondrup. He was taken to [[Tsurphu monastery]] for his enthronement and he received all the teachings and empowerments and studied philosophy and medicine from Karmapa Jangchub Dorje, Shamar Rinpoche, and Rigzin Tsewang Norbu.

At the age of 22, Chokyi Jungne convened scholars in He-Le to transcribe Tengyur based on the transcript kept in Chiwa-Datse. After completing the transcribing in two months, he traveled west to Nepal on pilgrimage, discussing knowledge with many scholars.

At the age of 23, he visited Ladakh and performed an empowerment for the king and his family. Then, he returned to Paljor monastery. At that period of time, he painted a set of [[thangkha]]s of eight [[mahasiddha]]s using the style of Gadri school of painting, and offered them to the king of Derge (example right).

On the second day of the third month in the female fire sheep year (1727), at the age of 28 years, Chokyi Jungne, under the permission of the king of Derge, he began to found the great Palpung monastery, and accomplished the founding on the tenth day of the eighth month in the year. He also built and restored countless other monasteries throughout his life. Palpung Monastery became the main seat of the Kenting Tai Situpas, and it was the inspiration for the founding of Palpung Sherab Ling Monastery in India by the 12th Kenting Tai Situpa Pema Donyo Nyinjey centuries later.

Chokyi Jungne revised texts of Kagyur, Tengyur of Derge transcript, and many literatures in order to make print plates of them. His disciple, Tenpa Tsering, the King of Derge, established the Derge Printing Press. Chokyi Jungne successively helped the Derge Printing Press to produce over 500,000 wood block prints. These prints are such fine quality that the major ones have been reprinted in modern editions and circulated to Tibetan archives in libraries throughout the world.

Chokyi Jungne painted a series of thangkhas which descript stories of Buddha Shakyamuni. These thangkhas which were painted in Indian style, decorated with imitated China embroideries, were very different form the existed Gadri school in layout, outline and colors, and called the new Gadri school (Karma Gadri). Chokyi Jungne also painted many other thangkhas and made many sculptures, which all enrich the Tibetan art culture.

At the age of 30, Chokyi Jungne went to Tibet for the third time. He visited Tsurphu monastery for the opening of a great statue. Then he stayed in Tibet on pilgrimage and teaching for four years.

In the wood mouse year, Chokyi Jungne completed the famous linguistic literature "Situ's Commentary of Tibetan Grammar". The grammar is still used as senior grammar in Tibet today.

In the wood cow year, Chokyi Jungne went to Tibet for the fourth time. He recognized and enthroned the new Shamarpa. Then he visited Nepal again on pilgrimage and was highly honored there. Once, after a debate with Pandita Jaya Mangola of Kashmir, it was proclaimed by the local Hindus that Kenting Tai Situpa must have been blessed by the Lord Shiva, since that was the only way he could have achieved such insight and learning.

At the age of 50, according to the Tibetan medical texts Chokyi Jungne made the famous medical pill "Moon Nectar Pill". In the fire mouse year, he made one kind of special pills which grew themselves more and more and spilled out of the bottle, and then the pills became all kind of Buddha. Afterwards, Chokyi Jungne performed more experiments and made many special pills. He became a skilled physician and a master of Tibetan medicine. He composed and wrote some medical books, which were deemed as valuable medical guidance still now.

At the age of 60, The Kenting Tai Situpa visited Jangsadam, south of China, for the second time. In there, he lightened the lamp of Buddha Dharma, rebuilt thirteen monasteries of Kagyu school. In the same period of time, he translated many texts from Sanskrit, including prayers to Bodhisattva Tara.

He also visited China at the invitation of the [[Qianlong Emperor]] (1735-1796) and was highly honored.

At the age of 63, he visited Tibet on pilgrimage for the fifth time. He retreated in a Drikung monastery. At that time, when he performed any kind of offering ceremony, a miracle emanation vision of Dorje Drolo showed up. Once in a Tara fire offering ceremony, the tent he slept grew many blue lotuses. In usual time, he kept reciting mantras except short rest time at noon and night. He recited three hundred million times of all kind of mantras. He showed many miracles like just an intention to stop a rainstorm, spreading barley to the sky and the barley straightened on the ground.

He found and recognized the 13th Karmapa Dudul Dorje, and personally taught the Karmapa and imparted the complete lineage to him.

At the age of 72, Chokyi Jungne invited the 13th Karmapa Dudul Dorje to Palpung monastery. He performed Taisho Tripitaka lineage empowerments and teachings for the Karmapa. At that time, the sky was filled of colorful clouds, a sacred sign enhancing people's faith to the 13th Karmapa.

In 1774, at the age of 74, Chokyi Jungne was invited to China. On the way to China, while meditating in the lotus posture of a Buddha, the Kenting Tai Situpa died. It was observed that his heart-region retained heat for seven days and there was a strong smell of incense everywhere. Kenting Tai Situpa predicted his next rebirth before his passing.

The 8th Kenting Tai Situpa was one of the most famous masters in Tibetan history. He was acknowledged as a supreme scholar who had no equal in the five knowledge. He is honored a unique title "Maha Pandita". His fame reached well beyond the borders of Tibet at this time. He also built or rebuilt many monasteries of different lineages. These monasteries became Palpung's satellite monasteries, even in mainland China, exceeding well beyond a hundred.

It is said that his limitless activities were equal to those of Nagajuna's in India. It was also a common saying at the time, that if all of the other Kagyu monasteries came together, their activity wouldn't be equal to that of Situ Chokyi Jungne.

His foremost disciples were the thirteenth Karmapa, the tenth Shamarpa, Gyalwang Drukpa Trinley Shingta, Drikung Chokyi Gyalwa, Pawo Tsuklag Gyalwa, Drubtop Choje Gyal, Khamtrul Chokyi Nyima, and Lotsawa Tsewang Kunchab.

==History==
The Assembly of Russian Writers, as it was originally called, was founded on 28 November 1870 by a group of authors who gathered at the place of the translator Vladimir Rodislavsky, initially to find the means for preventing works from being produced on theatre stage without their authors' permission. By the time it was launched officially on 21 October 1874, the organisation included 81 members, among them [[Alexander Ostrovsky]], [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy|A.K. Tolstoy]], [[Nikolai Nekrasov]], [[Nikolai Leskov]], [[Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Grigory Danilevsky]] and [[Pyotr Boborykin]]. 

Ostrovsky was elected its first chairman, Rodislavsky its secretary. After Ostrovsky's death, he was succeeded by first [[Sergey Yuriev]], then Apollon Maykov (the slavist, not to be confused with the renowned [[Apollon Maykov|poet]]) and [[Ippolit Shpazhinsky]]. In October 1875 a group of composers led by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] joined in, and the organization's name was changed to the Society of Russian Dramatists and Opera Composers. In 1887 [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]] and [[Dmitry Mamin-Sibiryak]] became its members.&lt;ref name="nat_loch"/&gt;

In 1904 the Society split into the Moscow and Petersburg sections. Both functioned separately up until 1925 when, re-organized, they merged again into the Union of the Drama and Music Writers (Союз драматических и музыкальных писателей).&lt;ref&gt;The Russian State Archive of Literature and Arts.

The '''''Statue of the Bear and the Strawberry Tree''''' (in Spanish “El Oso y el Madroño”) is a [[sculpture]] from the second half of the 20th century, situated in the Spanish city of [[Madrid]]. It represents the [[coat of arms of Madrid]] and is found on the east side of the [[Puerta del Sol]], between [[Calle de Alcalá]] and St. Jerónimo run, in the historical centre of the capital.

== History ==
The statue is a work of the sculptor {{Interlanguage link multi|Antonio Navarro Santafé|es}}(1906-1983) and was inaugurated in 1967. It was promoted by the section of Culture of the [[City Council of Madrid|City council of Madrid]], which wanted to represent the main heraldic symbols of the city and of Spain with a monument.

The first appearance of a wild [[bear]] and a [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] on the coat of arms of the city was in the 13th century. Previously, it only incorporated a bear in [[Attitude_(heraldry)#Passant|passant]] [[Attitude_(heraldry)|attitude]], until it was replaced in the aforementioned century by the two current figures. With this change, they wanted to symbolise the resolution adopted by the municipality and the Chapter of Priests and Beneficiaries after a long litigation about the control of Madrilenian pastures and trees. Since this agreement, the former became property of the Chapter and the latter of the council. From here they modified the arms, including a strawberry tree and of a bear in a new posture: leaning on the tree with both paws.

The sculpture has always been in the [[Puerta del Sol]], but in two different locations inside the square. Before 1986, it was situated in the east side of it, in the vicinity of the building between the [[Calle de Alcalá]] and the [[Carrera St. Jerónimo]]. That year, it was moved to the front of Carmen Street for the square's reform and remodeling, promoted by mayor [[Enrique Tierno Galván]]. In September 2009, with the integral renewal of the square promoted by [[Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón]], it has gone back to its original location.

== Description ==
The ''Statue of the Bear and the Strawberry Tree'' is made of stone and [[bronze]]. It weighs approximately 22 tons (20 [[tonne]]s) and stands 13&amp;nbsp;ft (4 m) tall. It rests on a staggered cubic pedestal of [[granite]].

It represents in a real-life form the [[coat of arms of Madrid]], with the tree taller than the bear, who supports his paws on the trunk and directs his attention towards one of the fruits. &lt;gallery&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4441">The '''Symphony No. 3''' (also known as '''''Symphony No. 3 "Silence"''''') is the third [[symphony]] by the Scottish composer [[James MacMillan]].  The piece was first performed on April 17, 2003 in [[NHK Hall]], [[Tokyo]], by the [[NHK Symphony Orchestra]] under the conductor [[Charles Dutoit]].&lt;ref name="Score"&gt;{{cite web |last=MacMillan |first=James |authorlink=James MacMillan |year=2002 |title=MacMillan, James: Symphony No. 3 |publisher=[[Boosey &amp; Hawkes]] |url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/James-MacMillan-Symphony-No-3-Silence/15181 |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
The symphony has a duration of roughly 36 minutes and is composed in one continuous [[Movement (music)|movement]].  The title of the piece comes from the 1966 novel [[Silence (novel)|''Silence'']] by the Japanese author [[Shūsaku Endō]].  MacMillan described this inspiration in the score program notes, writing:{{quote|His book asks profound philosophical questions and resonates with one of the most anguished questions asked 2,000 years ago "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?" Endo's "silence" is the silence of God in the face of terrible events springing from the merciless nature of man: torture, genocide, holocaust. After experiencing one of these events, one of Endo's characters writes: "I cannot bear the monotonous sound of the dark sea gnawing at the shore. Behind the depressing silence of this sea, the silence of God… the feeling that while men raise their voices in anguish, God remains with folded arms, silent." 

For Endo, though, this silence is not absence but presence. It is the silence of accompaniment rather than "nihil". This is a notion that has many musical analogies. Music itself grows out of silence. The emptiness and solitude of a composer's silence is nevertheless pregnant with the promise of possibility and potency. The immateriality of music points to the reality of different types of existence. Music is not a physical reality in the sense that we are, or any other thing is. You cannot see, touch or taste music, but its powerful presence always makes itself felt.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;}}
The composition also includes a musical allusion to the prelude from [[Richard Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Das Rheingold]]''.&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

===Instrumentation===
The work is scored for an orchestra comprising two [[Western concert flute|flutes]], [[alto flute]] (doubling [[piccolo]]), two [[oboe]]s, [[cor anglais]], two [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], [[contrabass clarinet]], two [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]], four [[French horn|horns]], three [[trumpet]]s, three [[trombone]]s, [[tuba]], [[timpani]], four percussionists, [[Pedal harp|harp]], [[piano]], and [[String section|strings]].&lt;ref name="Score" /&gt;

==Reception==
Roger Thomas of ''[[BBC Music Magazine]]'' lauded the symphony, writing, "The work is a hauntingly ambivalent study at both the musical and philosophical levels, with themes and textures arising seemingly from their own absence, interacting and developing, then being allowed to return to their origins."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomas |first=Roger |title=Macmillan: Symphony No. 3, The Confession of Isobel Gowdie |work=[[BBC Music Magazine]] |date=20 January 2012 |url=http://www.classical-music.com/review/macmillan-17 |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  David Nice of ''[[The Arts Desk]]'' was more critical, however, remarking that the work "sounded like an unwieldy impersonation of the monumental."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Nice |first=David |title=Prom 24: BBCSSO, Runnicles |work=[[The Arts Desk]] |date=August 4, 2015 |url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/classical-music/prom-24-bbcsso-runnicles-0 |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WQXR-FM]] included the piece in their list of the "Top Five Sounds of Silence" in classical music, remarking that MacMillan "finds all kinds of potential and promise in silence, dots this work (as well as many of his others) with pregnant pauses, and meditative moments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top Five Sounds of Silence |publisher=[[WQXR-FM]] |date=August 24, 2011 |url=http://www.wqxr.org/#!/story/115523-top-five-sounds-silence/ |accessdate=November 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Colossus and Other Poems.jpg|thumb|First edition, 1960]]
'''''The Colossus and Other Poems''''' is a poetry collection by American poet [[Sylvia Plath]], first published by [[Heinemann (publisher)|Heinemann]], in 1960. It is the only volume of poetry by Plath that was published before her death in 1963.

==Contents==
The 44 poems presented here are in the published order.&lt;ref&gt;Plath, Sylvia (1987) ''The Colossus'' Faber and Faber {{ISBN|0-571-09864-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!---Please do not add to or change the poems on this list. This is the full, referenced contents of the book.---&gt;The list below contains the poems published in the US version of the collection, which omits several poems from the original UK edition, including most of the seven sections of "Poem for a Birthday", only two of which ("Flute Notes from a Reedy Pond" and "The Stones") are included in the US edition. The title ''The Colossus'' comes from "Kolossus" a character who appeared in the [[ouija board]] games of Plath and Ted Hughes directing her to write poems on certain topics.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Plath 1438148445   2013   (Journals, 409) In early July, they brought out their ouija board and spoke with their spirit, Pan, whose god is "Kolossus"; Pan told her to write about the Lorelei. 6 As a result, Plath wrote apoem, "Lorelei," which explored her Germanic roots. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erica Wagner - Ariel's Gift: Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath, and the Story of Birthday ... 2002   0393292673
... she would be told that Prince Otto could not speak to her directly, because he was under orders from the Colossus. And when she pressed for an audience with the Colossus, they would say he was inaccessible. It is easy to see how her effort to come to terms with the meaning this Colossus held for her, in her poetry, became more and more central as the years passed.” Plath wrote to her mother in 1958 that “Pan claims his family god, 'Kolossus,' tells him much of this information.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Prominent journalist, poet and literary critic for ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper, [[Al Alvarez]], called the posthumous re-release of the book, after the success of ''[[Ariel (book)|Ariel]]'', a "major literary event" and wrote of Plath's work:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"She steers clear of feminine charm, deliciousness, gentility, supersensitivity and the act of being a poetess. She simply writes good poetry. And she does so with a seriousness that demands only that she be judged equally seriously... There is an admirable no-nonsense air about this; the language is bare but vivid and precise, with a concentration that implies a good deal of disturbance with proportionately little fuss."&lt;ref&gt;Plath, Sylvia.

'''''The Hot Zone: A Terrifying True Story''''' is a [[best-selling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E3DA1E39F937A35755C0A963958260 | title = Best Sellers|date= June 4, 1995 | accessdate = 2008-09-29|work=[[The New York Times Book Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1995 [[nonfiction]] thriller by [[Richard Preston]] about the origins and incidents involving [[viral hemorrhagic fever]]s, particularly [[ebolavirus]]es and [[marburgvirus]]es. The basis of the book was Preston's 1992 ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article "Crisis in the Hot Zone".&lt;ref name="PrestonCrisis"&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Richard |last=Preston |date=October 26, 1992 |title=Crisis in the Hot Zone |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1992/10/26/crisis-in-the-hot-zone |work=[[The New Yorker]] |accessdate=July 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Filoviridae|filoviruses]], [[Ebola virus]], [[Sudan virus]], [[Marburg virus]], and [[Ravn virus]] are [[Biosafety level#Biosafety level 4|Biosafety Level 4]] agents. Biosafety Level 4 agents are extremely dangerous to humans because they are very infectious, have a high case-fatality rate, and have no known [[prophylactics]], treatments, or cures.

Along with describing the history of the diseases caused by these two [[Central Africa]]n diseases, [[Ebola virus disease]] and [[Marburg virus disease]], Preston described a 1989 incident in which a relative of Ebola virus, named [[Reston virus]], was discovered at a primate quarantine facility in [[Reston, Virginia]], less than 15 miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) away from [[Washington, D.C.]] The virus found at the facility was a mutated form of the original Ebola virus and was initially mistaken for [[Simian hemorrhagic fever virus|Simian hemorrhagic fever]]. The original Reston facility involved in the incident, located at 1946 Isaac Newton Square, was subsequently demolished on 30 May 1995, and a new building was constructed in its place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kindercare.com/our-centers/center-details/303031/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbase.com/eeegi/image/24157826 E.G. Bradshaw, Monkey House in Reston, Va]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
The book is in four sections:

* "The Shadow of Mount Elgon" delves into the history of filoviruses, as well as speculation about the origins of [[AIDS]]. Preston recounts the story of "Charles Monet" (a [[pseudonym]]), who might have caught Marburg virus from visiting [[Kitum Cave]] on [[Mount Elgon]] in [[Kenya]]. The author describes in great detail the progression of the disease, from the initial headache and backache, to the final stage in which Monet's internal organs fail and he "bleeds out" (i.e., hemorrhages extensively) in a waiting room in a Nairobi hospital. This part also introduces a young promising physician who became infected with Marburg virus while treating Monet. Nancy Jaax's story is told. Viruses, [[biosafety level]]s and procedures were described. The Ebola virus disease outbreaks caused by Ebola virus and its cousin, [[Sudan virus]], are mentioned. Preston talks to the man who named the Ebola virus.
* "The Monkey House" chronicles the discovery of [[Reston virus]] among imported monkeys in [[Reston, Virginia]], and the following actions taken by the [[U.S. Army]] and [[Centers for Disease Control]]. It starts with the monkey house receiving a shipment of 100 wild monkeys. After four weeks, 29 of these monkeys have died. This is followed by the veterinarian for the facility, Dan Dalgard, examining the dead monkeys and sending the samples to [[Peter Jahrling]], a virologist at [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]]. After seeing a rope-like virus under the microscope, it is suspected that the monkeys were infected with a hot agent similar to the [[Marburg virus disease|Marburg]] virus. Jahrling then conducts a blood test to find out that the hot agent is the Ebola Zaire virus. This conclusion leads to the Army Medical Research Institute deciding to euthanize all the monkeys in the same room as the infected monkeys.
* "Smashdown" is more on the Reston epizootic, which involved a strain of the virus that does not affect humans but which easily spreads by air, and is very similar to its cousin the [[Ebola virus]].
* "Kitum Cave" tells of the author's visit of the cave that is the suspected home of the natural [[host (biology)|host]] animal that Ebola lives inside of.

The book starts with "Charles Monet" visiting [[Kitum Cave]] during a camping trip to Mount Elgon in Central Africa. Not long after, he begins to suffer from a number of symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea and red eye. He is soon taken to Nairobi Hospital for treatment, but his condition deteriorates further and he goes into a coma while in the waiting room. This particular filovirus is called [[Marburg virus]].

Dr. Nancy Jaax had been promoted to work in the Level 4 Biosafety containment area at the [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]], and is assigned to research [[Ebola virus]]. While preparing food for her family at home, she cuts her right hand. Later, while working on a dead monkey infected with Ebola virus, one of the gloves on the hand with the open wound tears, and she is almost exposed to contaminated blood, but does not get infected. Nurse Mayinga is also infected by a nun and elects to visit Nairobi Hospital for treatment, where she succumbs to the disease.

In Reston, Virginia, less than fifteen miles (24&amp;nbsp;km) away from Washington, D.C., a company called Hazelton Research once operated a [[quarantine]] center for monkeys that were destined for laboratories. In October 1989, when an unusually high number of their monkeys began to die, their veterinarian decided to send some samples to Fort Detrick (USAMRIID) for study.  Early during the testing process in [[Biosafety level#Levels|biosafety level 3]], when one of the flasks appeared to be contaminated with harmless [[pseudomonas]] [[bacterium]], two USAMRIID scientists exposed themselves to the virus by [[waft]]ing the flask. They later determine that, while the virus is terrifyingly lethal to monkeys, humans can be infected with it without any health effects at all. This virus is now known as [[Reston virus]].

Finally, the author himself goes into Africa to explore Kitum Cave. On the way, he discusses the role of [[AIDS]] in the present, as the highway they were on, sometimes called the "[[Kinshasa Highway|AIDS Highway]]", or the "Kinshasa Highway", was where it first appeared. Equipped with a [[hazmat suit]], he enters the cave and finds a large number of animals, one of which might be the virus carrier. At the conclusion of the book, he travels to the quarantine facility in Reston.  He finds the building abandoned and deteriorating. He concludes the book by claiming that Ebola will be back.

== Reston Virus Outbreak ==
The discovery of the [[Reston virus]] was made in November 1989 by Thomas W. Geisbert, an intern at [[United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases]]. Dr. Peter B. Jahrling isolated the filovirus further. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention conducted blood tests of the 178 animal handlers. While 6 tested positive, they did not exhibit any symptoms. The Reston virus was found to have low [[pathogenicity]] in humans. This was further supported later when a handler infected himself during a necroscopy of an infected monkey. However, the handler did not show symptoms of the virus after the incubation period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC|last=McCormick|first=Joseph|publisher=|year=1996|isbn=978-0-7607-1208-5|location=|pages=298–299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
''The Hot Zone'' was listed as one of around 100 books that shaped a century of science by ''[[American Scientist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, P. 100 or so Books that shaped a Century of Science. Retrieved February 17, 2016, from http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/100-or-so-books-that-shaped-a-century-of-science&lt;/ref&gt; Listed as an “Exploration,” the criteria dictate that the book typically “seeks to engage with the context” elucidating the general topic rather than a specific nuance.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Many reviews of ''The Hot Zone'' exemplify the impact the book had on the public’s view of [[Emergent virus|emerging viruses.]] A review in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' captures the paranoia and public panic described in this book. The reviewer was left “wondering when and where this enigmatic agent will appear next and what other disasters may await human primates.”&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith, N. S.. (1994). [Review of The Hot Zone]. BMJ: British Medical Journal, 309(6962), 1168–1169. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/29725319&lt;/ref&gt; This can also be seen in a review in the ''Public Health Reports'' which highlights the “seriousness of our current situation” and “our ability to respond to a major health threat.”&lt;ref&gt;Morse, S. A.. (1995). The Year 2000: Only a Plane Flight Away from Disaster? [Review of The Hot Zone; The Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World out of Balance]. Public Health Reports (1974-), 110(2), 223–225. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/4597805&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hot Zone'' has been criticized for exaggerating the threat of [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] and causing viral panic. In an interview about his book about Ebola, [[David Quammen]] claimed that ''The Hot Zone'' had “vivid, gruesome details” that gave an “exaggerated idea of Ebola over the years” causing “people to view this disease as though it was some sort of preternatural phenomenon.”&lt;ref&gt;Doucleff, M. (2014, November 11). How 'The Hot Zone' Got It Wrong And Other Tales Of Ebola's History. Retrieved March 28, 2016, from https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2014/11/11/362379449/how-the-hot-zone-got-it-wrong-and-other-tales-of-ebolas-history&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hot Zone'' is described as a “romantic account of environmental transgression.” Reactions to this book could be seen not only in the public’s view of emerging viruses, but in the changes in the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. In addition to the funding of public health infrastructure during the early 1970s, there were many public discussions of biodefense. This book continued to fuel the emerging diseases campaign. By connecting international health to [[Bioterrorism|national security]], this campaign used ''The Hot Zone'' as a method of justifying increased intervention in the global phenomena of disease.&lt;ref&gt;King, N. B.. (2004). The Scale Politics of Emerging Diseases. Osiris, 19, 62–76. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/3655232&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hot Zone'' elicited a major response by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] by shedding light on the [[Ebola Zaire|Ebola Zaire outbreak]]. The release of teams of experts was immediate and massive. Many countries tightened their borders, issued warnings to custom officials, quarantined travelers, and issued travel advisories.&lt;ref&gt;Ungar, S.. (1998). Hot Crises and Media Reassurance: A Comparison of Emerging Diseases and Ebola Zaire. The British Journal of Sociology, 49(1), 36–56. http://doi.org/10.2307/591262&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[blurb]], horror writer [[Stephen King]] called the first chapter, "one of the most horrifying things I've read in my whole life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/richardpreston/bookshelf/hz.html | title=About The Hot Zone | publisher=Random House | accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When asked whether any book "scared the pants off you" writer [[Suzanne Collins]] answered, "''The Hot Zone'', by Richard Preston. I just read it a few weeks ago. Still recovering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://shelf-life.ew.com/2010/08/12/suzanne-collins-on-the-books-she-loves/ | title=Suzanne Collins on the books she loves | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=Aug 12, 2010 | accessdate=30 July 2014 | author=Jordan, Tina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Hot Zone'' has received criticism for sensationalizing the effects of Ebola virus.  In their memoir ''Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Level 4: Virus Hunters of the CDC |isbn=978-0760712085 }}&lt;/ref&gt; former CDC scientists [[Joseph B. McCormick]] and [[Susan Fisher-Hoch]] lambasted Preston for claiming that Ebola dissolves organs, stating that although it causes great blood loss in tissues the organs remain structurally intact.  McCormick and Fisher-Hoch also dispute Preston's version of the CDC's actions in the Reston virus incident.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Adaptations==

===Failed film adaptation===
In January 1993, [[20th Century Fox]] and producer [[Lynda Obst]] won a bidding war for the film rights to Preston's 1992 ''New Yorker'' article, which was being transitioned into the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/1993/film/news/fox-obst-contract-virus-pic-103313/ | title=Fox, Obst contract virus pic | publisher=Variety | date=January 24, 1993 | accessdate=March 1, 2015 | author=Eller, Claudia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to being outbid, [[Warner Bros.]] producer [[Arnold Kopelson]] immediately began working on the similarly themed ''[[Outbreak (film)|Outbreak]]'', a competing film which would ultimately be a factor leading to the collapse of ''Crisis in The Hot Zone''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://variety.com/1994/film/news/virus-pic-fever-infects-fox-wb-118266/ | title=Virus pic fever infects Fox, WB | publisher=Variety | date=February 13, 1994 | accessdate=March 1, 2015 | author=O'Steen, Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directors considered for the film adaptation included [[Wolfgang Petersen]] (who would later direct ''Outbreak''), [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]], and [[Ridley Scott]].  Scott eventually signed on to direct the film in February 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=February 14, 1994 |title=Ridley Scott has signed on to direct "Crisis in the Hot Zone" |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-02-14-1994-1 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=February 14, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Screenwriter James V. Hart was also signed to adapt the book.  In late-April 1994, Fox announced they had signed [[Robert Redford]] and [[Jodie Foster]] to star in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 2, 1994 |title=Fox set the deals on "Crisis in the Hot Zone" for Robert Redford and Jodie Foster |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/WV-05-02-1994-13 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=May 2, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this version would ultimately not be made.  Foster dropped out of the film just before filming was to begin and production was delayed with [[Meryl Streep]], [[Sharon Stone]], and [[Robin Wright]] touted as possible replacements. In August 1994, Redford also dropped out of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 15, 1994 |title=Robert Redford has departed 20th Century Fox's "Crisis in the Hot Zone." |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-08-15-1994-1 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=August 15, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few days following Redford's departure, it was announced that pre-production had been shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=August 19, 1994 |title="Crisis" in the Not Zone |url=http://www.varietyultimate.com/archive/issue/DV-08-19-1994-1 |deadurl= |journal= |location=varietyultimate.com |publisher=Variety |archiveurl= |archivedate=August 19, 1994 |accessdate=March 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television series===
On October 16, 2014, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that Ridley Scott again plans to adapt the book, this time as a [[television miniseries]] for [[NatGeo]]. [[Kelly Souders]], [[Brian Wayne Peterson|Brian Peterson]], and [[Jeff Vintar]] wrote the pilot.  [[Julianna Margulies]] is starring as Nancy Jaax.  Filming begins in September 2018.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/ebola-tv-series-works-lynda-741457 | title=Ebola TV Series in the Works From Lynda Obst, Ridley Scott (Exclusive) | work=The Hollywood Reporter | date=Oct 16, 2014 | accessdate=20 October 2014 | author=Siegel, Tatiana}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynda Obst will again produce the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://io9.com/thank-the-ebola-outbreak-ridley-scott-will-finally-mak-1648330513 | title=20 Years Too Late, Ridley Scott's Finally Adapting The Hot Zone | publisher=IO 9 | date=Oct 16, 2014 | accessdate=20 October 2014 | author=Trendacosta, Katharine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:tint-tone-shade.svg|thumb|right]]
[[File:Kleurenovergang van zwart naar blauw.png|right|thumb|Some [[shades of blue]]]]

In [[color theory]], a '''tint''' is a mixture of a color with [[white]], which reduces [[darkness]], while a '''shade''' is a mixture with [[black]], which increases darkness. A '''tone''' is produced either by mixing a color with [[grey]], or by both tinting and shading.&lt;ref&gt;Color Theory: An Essential Guide to Color-from Basic Principles to Practical Applications by Patti Mollica, page 17, {{ISBN|1-60058-302-4}}, 9781600583025&lt;/ref&gt; Mixing a color with any [[neutral color]] (including black, gray and white) reduces the [[Chrominance|chroma]], or [[colorfulness]], while the [[hue]] remains unchanged.

In common language, the term ''shade'' can be generalized to furthermore encompass any varieties of a particular color, whether technically they are shades, tints, tones, or slightly different hues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shade|title=Definition of SHADE|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the term ''tint'' can be generalized to refer to any lighter or darker variation of a color (e.g. [[tinted windows]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tint|title=Definition of TINT|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When mixing colored light (additive color models), the achromatic mixture of spectrally balanced red, green, and blue (RGB) is always white, not gray or black. When we mix colorants, such as the [[pigment]]s in [[paint]] mixtures, a color is produced which is always darker and lower in chroma, or saturation, than the parent colors. This moves the mixed color toward a neutral color—a gray or near-black. Lights are made brighter or dimmer by adjusting their brightness, or energy level; in painting, lightness is adjusted through mixture with white, black or a [[complementary color|color's complement]].

==In art==
It is common among some artistic painters to darken a paint color by adding black paint—producing colors called ''shades''—or to lighten a color by adding white—producing colors called ''tints''. However, this is not always the best way for representational painting, since an unfortunate result is for colors to also shift in their hues. For instance, darkening a color by adding black can cause colors such as yellows, reds and oranges, to shift toward the greenish or bluish part of the spectrum. Lightening a color by adding white can cause a shift towards blue{{clarify|date=November 2012|which route: via green or via purple?}} when mixed with reds and oranges.

Another practice when darkening a color is to use its opposite, or complementary, color (e.g. violet-purple added to yellowish-green) in order to neutralize it without a shift in hue, and darken it if the additive color is darker than the parent color. When lightening a color this hue shift can be corrected with the addition of a small amount of an adjacent color to bring the hue of the mixture back in line with the parent color (e.g. adding a small amount of orange to a mixture of red and white will correct the tendency of this mixture to shift slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum).

[[File:HSLSphere.svg|thumb|600px|center|An extension of the color wheel: the color sphere. Colors nearest the center or the poles are most ''achromatic''. Colors of the same lightness and saturation, but of different hue, are called ''nuances''. Colors of the same hue and saturation, but of different lightness, are called ''tints'' and ''shades''. Colors of the same hue and lightness, but of different saturation, are called ''tones''.]]'''

[[Image:Grabmaljohannes13.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Antipope John XXIII]]
The '''Tomb of Antipope John XXIII''' is the [[marble]]-and-bronze [[tomb]] [[Church monument|monument]] of [[Antipope]] [[Antipope John XXIII|John XXIII]] (Baldassare Cossa, c.&amp;nbsp;1360–1419), created by [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]] for the [[Florence Baptistry]] adjacent to [[Florence Cathedral|the Duomo]]. It was commissioned by the executors of Cossa's will after his death on December 22, 1419 and completed during the 1420s, establishing it as one of the early landmarks of [[History of Florence#Renaissance Florence|Renaissance Florence]]. According to [[Ferdinand Gregorovius]], the tomb is "at once the [[sepulchre]] of the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]] in the church and the last [[list of extant papal tombs|papal tomb]] which is outside Rome itself".&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cossa had a long history of cooperation with Florence, which had viewed him as the legitimate pontiff for a time during the [[Western Schism]]. The tomb monument is often interpreted as an attempt to strengthen the legitimacy of Cossa's pontificate by linking him to the spiritually powerful site of the Baptistry.&lt;ref name="Lightbown 1980, p. 107"&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 16l; Caplow, 1977, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The evocation of papal symbolism on the tomb and the linkage between Cossa and Florence have been interpreted as a snub to Cossa's successor [[Pope Martin V]]&lt;ref name="Lightbown 1980, p. 107"/&gt; or vicarious "[[Medici]] self-promotion", as such a tomb would have been deemed unacceptable for a Florentine citizen.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 156; Strocchia, 1992, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tomb monument's design included figures of the [[Theological virtues|three Virtues]] in [[Niche (architecture)|niche]]s, Cossa's [[Coat of arms|family arms]], a gilded bronze [[effigy|recumbent effigy]] laid out above an inscription-bearing [[sarcophagus]] supported on corbel brackets, and above it a [[Madonna and Child]] in a [[Lunette|half-lunette]], with a [[Baldachin|canopy]] over all. At the time of its completion, the monument was the tallest sculpture in Florence,&lt;ref name="l26"/&gt; and one of very few tombs within the Baptistry or the neighboring Duomo.&lt;ref name="l24"/&gt; The tomb monument was the first of several collaborations between Donatello and Michelozzo, and the attribution of its various elements to each of them has been debated by [[art historian]]s, as have the interpretations of its design and [[iconography]].

==Antipope John XXIII==
[[Image:Johannes XXIII Gegenpapst.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Antipope John XXIII]]
{{main|Antipope John XXIII}}
Antipope John XXIII had a complicated life, legacy, and relationship with the city of Florence. Baldassare Cossa was a [[Naples|Neapolitan]] nobleman who grew up in [[Bologna]]. [[Pope Boniface IX]] elevated Cossa to the [[Archdiocese of Bologna]] in 1396 and made him a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in 1402. After the [[Council of Pisa]] in 1409, Cossa encouraged rebellion against [[Pope Gregory XII]], who refused to resign. Cossa was deprived of his cardinalate, but it was restored by [[Antipope Alexander V]], who had been elected by the council.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 4; Caplow, 1977, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cossa succeeded Alexander V as John XXIII in 1410. John XXIII was acknowledged as pope by France, England, [[Bohemia]], [[Prussia]], [[Portugal]], parts of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and numerous Northern Italian city states, including Florence and [[Venice]]; however, the [[Avignon Pope Benedict XIII]] was regarded as pope by the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Kingdoms of Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], and [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] and Gregory XII was still favored by [[Ladislaus of Naples]], [[Carlo I Malatesta]], the [[List of rulers of Bavaria|princes of Bavaria]], [[Louis III, Elector Palatine|Louis III]], [[Elector of the Palatinate]], and parts of Germany and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ladislaus of Naples conquered Rome in 1413, John XXIII was forced to flee to Florence. He was compelled by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]], to convoke the [[Council of Constance]] in 1414, although when the threat to his pontificate and possibly his person became apparent, he fled in 1415. Although he expected his departure would disperse the council, the members of which he called to join him under the protection of [[Frederick IV, Duke of Austria]], it continued to operate where they were. As John XXIII tried to make his way towards the territory of [[John the Fearless|John II]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], Frederick IV surrendered him to the custody of Sigismund and the Council, and he was imprisoned by Louis III.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, the Council deposed John XXIII on May 29, 1415 and elected [[Pope Martin V]] on November 11, 1417; Martin V proceeded to Florence in February 1419.&lt;ref&gt;Strocchia, 1992, p. 137; Lightbown, 1980, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Cossa was ransomed by the [[Republic of Florence]] in 1419 (Louis III had abandoned the allegiance of Sigismund in 1417), as orchestrated by [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici]].&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; His ransom may have been a reward for past assistance to Florence, or a manoeuvre to put pressure on Martin V (still in Florence; he would arrive in Rome in September 1420), or both.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Cossa had helped Florence conquer [[Pisa]] in 1405 in his capacity as [[Papal legate]] to Bologna and, as pope, had designated the [[Medici bank]] as the depository-general for the papal finances.&lt;ref&gt;Strocchia, 1992, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Florence, Cossa submitted to Martin V on June 14, 1419 and was rewarded with a cardinal's hat on June 26, only to die on December 22.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, pp. 99–100.&lt;/ref&gt; Although given the title of Cardinal Bishop of [[Tusculum]], Cossa called himself "Cardinal of Florence".&lt;ref&gt;Strocchia, 1992, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funeral===
Cossa's body was moved to the Baptistry and the nine-day funeral, as prescribed by the ''Ordo Romanus'', was well-attended by the Florentine elite and the papal court.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Cossa's corpse was crowned with a white [[mitre]] with his cardinal's hat at his feet on the funerary bier during the rituals, which took place entirely within the Baptistry and Duomo.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, pp. 154–5; Strocchia, 1992, p. 138; Lightbown, 1980, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The first three days of ceremonies celebrated in turn Cossa's role as cardinal and pope, his role as an ally of Florence, and his role as a private citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Strocchia, 1992, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; He received a temporary burial until the tomb was complete.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commissioning==
[[Image:Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici]], one of the executors of Cossa's will]]
The commissioning of Cossa's tomb monument was negotiated for about a decade following Cossa's death. Cossa's [[will (law)|last will and testament]]—written on his death bed on December 22, 1419—made several of the customary Florentine civic bequests, acts of charity, and traditional ecclesiastical courtesies, but the bulk of his estate was left to his nephews Michele and Giovanni.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The bequests to his nephews took priority, and his estate remained disputed by various creditors while the tomb was being completed.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cossa designated four prominent Florentines as his [[executor]]s: Bartolommeo di Taldo Valori, Niccolò da Uzzano, [[Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici]], and Vieri Guadagni,&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1963, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing any two of the executors to act on behalf of all four, as Valori and Medici appear to have done.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Valori died on September 2, 1427, by which time Guadagni was also deceased and Uzzano had long lost interest, leaving the remaining work of commissioning entirely to Giovanni, or—more likely—[[Cosimo de' Medici]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The executors claimed that Cossa had revealed his desire for burial in the Baptistry to them but had been too modest to request it in his will.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, pp. 155–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Most later scholars accept this testimony of the executors, attributing Cossa with "tact—and tactics", although at least one has postulated that the executors chose the site of the Baptistry against Cossa's wishes.&lt;ref name="Janson"&gt;Janson, 1963, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:FlorenceMuseodellOperaBaptistFinger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Cossa willed a relic, believed to be the right [[index finger]] of [[John the Baptist]], to the Baptistry (''reliquary pictured'')]]

Documentary records indicate that, on January 9, 1421, [[Palla Strozzi]], on behalf of the [[Arte di Calimala]], the [[guild]] who were responsible for the upkeep of the Baptistry, authorized a "''breve et honestissima''" ("small and inconspicuous") monument in the Baptistry, but not the chapel requested by Cossa's will; present scholarship accepts Strozzi's assertion that burial within the Baptistry was a considerable honor, perhaps beyond the status of Cossa.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1963, p. 59; Caplow, 1977, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; After this meeting, there are no extant records from the Calimala regarding the tomb as the bulk of documents from the 1420s have been lost,&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; although the notes of Senatore [[Carlo Strozzi]], who went through the records, are extant.&lt;ref name="Lightbown"&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Calimala's acquiescence is traditionally explained by Cossa's donation of the [[relic]] of the right [[index finger]] of [[John the Baptist]] (and 200&amp;nbsp;[[Italian coin florin|florins]] for an appropriate [[reliquary]]) to the Baptistry.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, pp. 101–102; Strocchia, 1992, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; With this finger John was believed to have pointed to Jesus, saying "[[Agnus Dei|Ecce Agnus Dei]]" ("Behold the lamb of God") in {{bibleverse||John|1:29|KJV}}. The long and complicated history of the relic would only have increased the legendary status of the finger: [[Patriarch Philotheus I of Constantinople|Philotheus Kokkinos]], [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]] presented it in 1363 to [[Pope Urban V]], who passed it to his successors [[Pope Gregory XI|Gregory XI]] and [[Pope Urban VI|Urban VI]], who was dispossessed of it during the siege of [[Nocera Inferiore|Nocera]], after which John XXIII bought it for 800&amp;nbsp;florins and wore it on his person before hiding it in the monastery of [[Santa Maria degli Angeli, Florence|Santa Maria degli Angeli]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Completion==
[[Image:Sangiovennniinner.jpg|thumb|The Tomb was designed to integrate with the interior of the [[Florence Baptistry]].]]
The chronology of the tomb monument's completion is not precisely known, but portions can be determined from various sources. According to the passing reference of a Florentine [[Civil law notary|notary]], in 1424 (by the [[Florentine calendar]]) part of the tomb was installed.&lt;ref name="Lightbown-1980"&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Michelozzo's ''[[Catasto]]'' from July 1427 indicates that Michelozzo had been Donatello's partner for about two years ("''due anni o incircha''") and that three-fourths of the 800&amp;nbsp;florin budget had been spent.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, pp. 105–108; Grassi, 1964, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; To harmonize these accounts, one must conclude either that Michelozzo's chronology was imprecise, that Donatello received the commission before the partnership was formed, or that the 1424 date in the Florentine calendar falls in 1425 in the modern calendar.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1964, pp. 59–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 1425, Bartolomeo Valori and Cosimo de' Medici requested 400 of the 800&amp;nbsp;florins that had been deposited with the [[Arte dei Mercatanti o di Calimala|Calimala]], likely for work already completed.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; This deposit was insurance in case the executors left the tomb unfinished and the Calimala was forced to pay for its completion, as it had been obliged to with the finger reliquary.&lt;ref name="Lightbown-1980_2"&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; This request is also the most direct piece of evidence for Cosimo's involvement with the commissioning. Despite this document, [[Vasari]]'s claim in his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects|Vite]]'' of 1550 that Cosimo was responsible for the handling of the commission has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, ''Vite'', ed. Milanesi, ii, 1878, p. 399. Cited by Caplow, 1977, p. 106; McHam, 1989, p. 156; Lightbown, 1980, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is probable that the sarcophagus was installed on or shortly before May 2, 1426, when the Calimala contracted for two chaplains to say a daily mass for Cossa's soul.&lt;ref name="Lightbown-1980_2"/&gt; The records of the Duomo workshop indicate that on January 28, 1427 Valori bought four white marble blocks for the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1963, p. 59; Caplow, 1977, pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact date of completion is unknown but an extreme ''[[Terminus post quem|terminus ante quem]]'' is given by the death in 1431 of Pope Martin V, who is known to have visited the completed tomb; other factors may push the ''terminus ante quem'' back significantly into the 1420s.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, pp. 116–119; McHam, 1989, p. 157; Strocchia, 1992, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The most reliable such indication is that in September 1428 [[Jacopo della Quercia]] returned to Bologna and produced a wall tomb with [[Virtues]] reflecting in minute details the Cossa Virtues.&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1963, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasari suggests that the tomb went over budget, costing 1,000&amp;nbsp;florins, although it is unclear who covered the excess.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 116; Lightbown, 1980, p. 23. This claim is also made by Del Migliore, 1684, ''Firenze città nobilissima''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original source for this claim is unknown, it has gained credence with modern scholars as the effigy alone would have cost 500&amp;nbsp;florins,&lt;ref name="Janson-1963"&gt;Janson, 1963, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; yet its exactness may be taken with a [[grain of salt]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[Image:Interior of Santi Giovanni e Paolo (Venice) - Monumento del doge Tommaso Mocenigo - Pietro Lamberti e Giovanni di Martino da Fiesole.jpg|thumb|The closely contemporary Venetian tomb of [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Tommaso Mocenigo]], of 1423.]]
The Baptistry already contained three [[sarcophagi]]: those of Bishop Ranieri (d. 1113) and two reused Roman sarcophagi.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 16, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tomb monument at {{convert|7.32|m|ft|2}} in height was easily the tallest monument in the Baptistry, and—at the time—in Florence.&lt;ref name="l26"&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Florence Cathedral|Duomo]] contains few tombs, with some notable exceptions, such as that of Aldobrandino Ottobuoni.&lt;ref name="l24"&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tomb monument adapted to the conditions imposed by the Calimala and integrated with the interior of the Baptistry. The [[wall tomb]] was required to be placed between two existing [[Corinthian order|Corinthian column]]s—those between [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]]'s North Doors and the western tribune—constituting one-third of one of the octagonal walls, near the altar and facing Ghiberti's East Doors.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 120; Lightbown, 1980, p. 24; McHam, "Donatello's Tomb of Pope John XXIII", p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; The setting starves the tomb monument of light, especially when the Baptistry's doors are closed, which is normally the case.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; It would be even darker were it not for the "screen" back wall protruding {{convert|48.4|cm|in|1}} from the Baptistry wall.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The white and brown (and whitish-brown) marble further integrates the structure with the [[polychromatic]] white and green of the Baptistry interior.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 149; Lightbown, 1980, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars accept the colored sketch of Buonaccorso Ghirberti as evidence that the "original effaced polychromy" of the tomb was more integrated,&lt;ref name="Janson"/&gt; although others contend that the sketch is too inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; The canopy's interaction with the columns and [[conceit]] of being supported by the Baptistry cornice make the tomb monument further "wedded to the architecture" around it, even if the marriage is [[morganatic]].&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the effigy on the sarcophagus, all the other sculpted figures are in [[high relief]].

Although the style of the work is thoroughly classicising, the overall form reflects the grandest type of the medieval Italian wall tomb, in which the vertical piling-up of a series of different elements is characteristic.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 1996, pp. 151–153.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Gothic sculpture always retained considerable elements of classicism, and it was not necessary for Donatello and Michelozzo to adopt a radically original overall scheme from those of [[Tino di Camaino]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1285–1337), the [[Siena|Siennese]] sculptor whose wall-tombs of a century before had been very influential throughout Italy.  A life-size marble effigy lying on top of an elevated protruding sarcophagus is highly typical.  The motif of curtains at the top is often found in monuments using Gothic decorative details, and the shape recalls the triangular [[gable]] tops of monuments in a more thoroughly Gothic style; other monuments have curtains, often held open by angels, around the effigy, and then sculptures above.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Hennessy, pp. 15–19 and 183–186.&lt;/ref&gt; The Cossa monument is often compared to the monument to [[Doge of Venice|Doge]] [[Tommaso Mocenigo]] of Venice, of 1423, which has high relief saints in shell niches on and above the sarcophagus, above which a large pair of curtains sweep up to a single terminal; however the architectural detailing here is Gothic.&lt;ref&gt;Pope-Hennessy, p. 46 and fig. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The design of the Cossa tomb itself was elaborated on, and adapted to local conventions, in the tomb by the same team for Cardinal Brancacci in Naples,&lt;ref&gt;John T. Paoletti, Gary M. Radke; ''Art in Renaissance Italy'', 2005, pp. 242–243, Laurence King Publishing, {{ISBN|1-85669-439-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influenced the monument to [[Leonardo Bruni]] by [[Bernardo Rossellino]], of about 20&amp;nbsp;years later, in the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Levey|Levey, Michael]]; ''Early Renaissance'', p. 57-59, 1967, Penguin&lt;/ref&gt;

===Base===
The base slab, or [[Pylon (architecture)|pylon]], of the tomb monument rests on a {{convert|38|cm|in|0|sing=on}} high [[plinth]], separated by a [[cornice]] and [[wiktionary:Concave|concave]] [[Molding (decorative)|moulding]]s. The pylon is {{convert|1.39|m|ft|2}} high and {{convert|2.02|m|ft|2}} wide, decorated with a [[frieze]] of winged angel heads (perhaps [[seraphim]]) and [[Garland (decoration)|garland]]s and ribbons.&lt;ref name="l26"/&gt;

===Virtues===
[[File:Tomba dell'antipapa giovanni xxiii, 02.JPG|thumb|Virtues by Michelozzo]]
Above the pylon, separated by the cornice, are the [[theological virtues|three Virtues]]—from left to right, [[Faith]], [[Charity (virtue)|Charity]], and [[Hope (virtue)|Hope]]—in shell niches, separated by four [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[pilaster|fluted pilasters]]. Such a motif is unprecedented in [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] funerary sculpture but found at this date in [[Venice]], [[Padua]],&lt;ref name="Janson-1963"/&gt; and especially Cossa's native [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, excursions to Venice have been suggested for both Michelozzo&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; and Donatello.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Janson suggests that one "need not go all the way to Venice" to find such motifs.&lt;ref name="Janson-1963"/&gt; Outside Florence, Virtues were common on tombs, with the [[cardinal Virtues]] used for [[laymen]], and the [[theological virtues]] reserved for ecclesiastics, including the [[Brancaccio]] tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Cossa Virtues, from their hair to their sandals, are more thoroughly antique.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Donatello also produced two similar bronze Virtues for the [[Siena Cathedral#Baptistry|Siena Baptistry]], whose chronological relationship to the Cossa Virtues is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|1.05|m|ft|2|sing=on}} tall Faith, to the right of Charity, is holding a [[Eucharist]]ic [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]]; the {{convert|1.07|m|ft|2|sing=on}} tall Charity is holding a [[cornucopia]] and a [[brazier]] (or flaming vase); and the {{convert|1.06|m|ft|2|sing=on}} tall Hope, to the left of Charity, has hands clasped in prayer.&lt;ref name="Lightbown-1980_3"&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The central figure of Charity is the most antique, assimilating elements of Classical depictions of [[Abundantia]], [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], and [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], all of which were depicted with cornucopias in their left hands.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 133; Lightbown, 1980, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides underscoring the antiquity of the tomb monument, the main purpose of the tall yet poorly finished Virtues is to put additional vertical distance between the viewer and the effigy, which has the cumulative effect of de-emphasizing the peculiarities of Cossa, in favor of a generic pontiff (i.e. a potential line of Florentine popes), by blunting the "immediacy" of the trope of [[lying in state]], which was otherwise dominant on [[Quattrocento]] wall tombs.&lt;ref name="McHam"&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarcophagus and inscription===
Above the Virtues, four classical [[Corbel|consoles]] decorated with [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] leaves support the sarcophagus. In the [[Triptych|tripartite]] space between the consoles—from left to right—are Cossa's family arms with the [[papal tiara]], the papal [[coat of arms]], and Cossa's family arms with the cardinal's hat.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''rilievo schiacciato'' (a type of very shallow [[bas-relief]] pioneered by Donatello) on the [[architrave]] sarcophagus ({{convert|2.12|m|ft|2|sing=on}} wide and {{convert|0.7|m|ft|2|sing=on}} high) depicts two [[putto|putti]] or spiratelli ("little spirits") holding open a large inscribed [[parchment]], perhaps in the style of a [[papal brief]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The putti (or spiratelli) share many characteristics with their ancient counterparts, except for their crossed legs.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{col-start}}
{{col-2}}
The inscription reads:&lt;ref name="Lightbown-1980"/&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
{{lang|la|IOAN''n''ES QVO''n''DAM PAPA&lt;br&gt;
XXIII''us''. OBIIT FLORENTIE A&lt;br&gt;
N''n''O D''omi''NI MCCCCXVIIII XI&lt;br&gt;
KALENDAS IANVARII}}
&lt;/center&gt;
{{col-2}}
Which translates to:
&lt;center&gt;
John the former pope&lt;br&gt;
XXIII. Died in Florence&lt;br&gt;
A.D. 1419, on 11th&lt;br&gt;
day before the Calends of January
&lt;/center&gt;
{{col-end}}
[[Image:Marzocco di donatello.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The ''Marzocco'' was a symbol of Florentine rule.]]
Pope Martin V objected to a portion of the inscription—"{{lang|la|IOAN''n''ES QVO''n''DAM PAPA}}"—because he thought it implied Cossa had died as pope (the [[Latin]] "{{lang|la|quondam}}" could mean either "the former" or "the late"). The use of "olim Papa", as was common in many contemporary documents, instead of "quondam Papa" would probably have removed Martin V's objections.&lt;ref name="Lightbown"/&gt; Martin himself suggested instead that Cossa be identified as a Neapolitan cardinal, thus emphasizing instead his submission.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 105; McHam, 1989, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary sources report that the [[Signoria of Florence|Signoria]] mimicked the reply of [[Pontius Pilate]] regarding the inscription on the cross of Christ: "What is written, is written."&lt;ref name="McHam-1989"&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin V himself was buried underneath an undecorated bronze floor slab,&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; the only known example of a two-dimensional papal monument,&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky, 1964, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; although also the first to be set in the central nave of a major basilica, the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] in Rome,&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, 1992, p. 62; Lightbown, 1980, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and cast in bronze.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, 1904, p. 76; Lightbown, 1980, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Avery, Donatello's ''Ascension of Christ and the Giving of the Keys to St. Peter'' may have been intended to share the front of the sarcophagus,&lt;ref&gt;Avery, 1994, pp. 36–39.&lt;/ref&gt; further strengthening the papal associations, which were created by dating Cossa's death using the ancient Roman [[Calends]] of January, which was uncommon on Florentine tombs, but was used in papal ones.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, pp. 163–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

On top of the sarcophagus, the [[bier]] of the effigy is supported by lions whose shape mimics [[Trecento]] consoles.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The lions may be based on the Florentine ''[[:it:Marzocco (simbolo)|Marzocco]]'', as if to mark John XXIII in the same manner as a conquered city-state. As Donatello's ''Marzocco'' for the papal apartment in [[Santa Maria Novella]] conveyed Florence's ambivalence towards Martin V (as both a source of prestige by visiting, and a potential adversary of the Republic), the lions supporting the bier contextualize the tomb monument's support for John XXIII's claim to the papacy by cementing it as a Florentine claim. Yet, any iconographical interpretation of the lions must be taken with a grain of salt as lions are symbolically promiscuous,&lt;ref name="McHam-1989"/&gt; and are also seen as supports on earlier tombs, such as that of Lapo de' Bardi (d.&amp;nbsp;1342) in the [[Bargello]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tomba dell'antipapa giovanni xxiii, 13.JPG|thumb|The sarcopagus with the antipope ''gisant'']]
The bier and the pall spread over it are tilted towards the viewer with the lion supporting the head standing {{convert|2|cm|in|0|sing=on}} shorter, increasing the visibility of the [[effigy]], especially the head.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, 1904, p. 63; Lightbown, 1980, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[gilding|gilded-bronze]], life-size effigy itself makes no attempt to argue for Cossa's papal status, dressing Cossa clearly in the costume of a cardinal;&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 43; McHam, 1989, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; the bedding it rests on is of un-gilt bronze.  The opening in the 16th century of the sarcophagus confirmed that Cossa's actual burial clothes matched the effigy.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; There was no precedent for a three-dimensional gilded-bronze effigy on an Italian tomb monument; there was, however, a {{convert|6|ft|m|2|sing=on}} gilt bronze statue on the balcony of the Palazzo della Briada in Bologna commissioned by [[Pope Boniface VIII]].&lt;ref name="McHam-1989"/&gt;

Some scholars suggest that Donatello created the effigy with the aid of a [[death mask]],&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 44; Grassi, 1965, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; but others disagree.&lt;ref name="Janson-1963_2"&gt;Janson, 1963, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canopy===
Behind the effigy is a {{convert|1.34|m|ft|2|sing=on}} tripartite pylon with sunk molded borders supporting the cornice and framed by two additional Corinthian pilasters. Above it rests an [[entablature]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] on a [[Lunette|half-lunette]], a typical—symbolizing intercession—motif for a tomb.&lt;ref&gt;McHam, 1989, p. 149, 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Above the effigy and Madonna is a gilt-edged architectonic canopy decorated with patterned stemmed flowers, giving the [[conceit]] of being supported by the ribbed brass ring, an impossibility given its weight. McHam&lt;ref name="McHam"/&gt; suggests that the canopy is based on the "Dome of Heaven", and thus the ''[[Baldachin|baldacchino]]'' of papal enthronement. However, Lightbown&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; is emphatic that the double-summited canopy looped against the pillars is not a baldacchino, but rather a secular bed-canopy.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attribution==
{{main|Donatello|Michelozzo}}
[[Image:Prato, duomo pulpito di donatello e michelozzo.JPG|thumb|upright|The external pulpit for the [[Prato Cathedral|Duomo of Prato]], another collaboration of Donatello and Michelozzo]]
The tomb monument was the first collaboration between [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]], who went on to collaborate on the [[tomb of Cardinal Rainaldo Brancacci]] in the Church of [[Sant'Angelo a Nilo]] in Naples, the tomb of [[Prefecture of the Pontifical Household|Papal Secretary]] Bartolomeo Aragazzi in what is now the [[Duomo]] of [[Montepulciano]], and the external pulpit of the [[Prato Cathedral|Duomo of Prato]].&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, pp. 2–3.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of their partnership, Donatello was already well known for his statues of prophets and saints for the Duomo and [[Orsanmichele]], while Michelozzo was more obscure.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Both had worked for a time for Ghiberti, whose workshop then led Florentine sculpture.

Nearly every element of the tomb monument has been attributed to both Donatello and Michelozzo by different [[art history|art historians]].&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, pp. 122–140; Janson, 1963, pp. 63–64; Lightbown, 1980, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; These characterizations are mostly of [[historiography|historiographical]] interest: attribution to Donatello is more of an indication of what is valued by each commentator than any objective criteria; often, aspects are attributed to Michelozzo explicitly because they are "less well executed".&lt;ref name="Lightbown-1980_3"/&gt;

Descriptions from 1475 to 1568 attribute all of the tomb except for the figure of Faith to Donatello.&lt;ref&gt;Caplow, 1977, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern sources reverse this dichotomy, attributing all of the tomb to Michelozzo with the exception of the gilded bronze effigy.&lt;ref name="McHam"/&gt; Some sources credit Donatello only with the bronze effigy.&lt;ref&gt;Grassi, 1964, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Janson, of the marble work, only the ''[[putto|putti]]'' can be attributed to "Donatello's own hand".&lt;ref name="Janson-1963_2"/&gt; Donatello's alleged deficiencies in casting or in architecture have been proposed as the reason for his partnership with Michelozzo,&lt;ref&gt;Janson, 1963, pp. 50–56, 63.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to his busy schedule.&lt;ref&gt;Lightbown, 1980, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wuthering Heights''''', [[Emily Brontë]]'s only novel, was published in 1847 under the pseudonym "Ellis Bell". It was written between October 1845 and June 1846.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=fN0gOdKQZD4C|title=Wuthering Heights|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wuthering Heights'' and [[Anne Brontë]]'s ''[[Agnes Grey]]'' were accepted by publisher Thomas Newby before the success of their sister [[Charlotte Brontë|Charlotte]]'s novel ''[[Jane Eyre]]''. After Emily's death, Charlotte edited the manuscript of ''Wuthering Heights'' and arranged for the edited version to be published as a posthumous second edition in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/wuthering/charlotte.html |title=Wuthering Heights: Publication &amp; Contemporary CriticalReception |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Wuthering Heights'' is now a classic of English literature, contemporary reviews were deeply polarised; it was controversial because of its unusually stark depiction of mental and physical cruelty, and it challenged strict Victorian ideals of the day regarding religious [[hypocrisy]], [[morality]], [[social class|social classes]] and [[gender inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/wuthering/critics.html |title=Later Critical Response to Wuthering Heights |publisher=Academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/wuthering/contemp_rev.html |title=Excerpts from Contemporary Reviews |publisher=Academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/novel_19c/wuthering/charlotte.html |title='&amp;#39;Wuthering Heights'&amp;#39;: Publication &amp; Contemporary Critical Reception |publisher=Academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English poet and painter [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], although an admirer of the book,  referred to it as "A fiend of a book&amp;nbsp;– an incredible monster&amp;nbsp; [...] The action is laid in hell,&amp;nbsp;– only it seems places and people have English names there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924013541895/cu31924013541895_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Letters of Dante Gabriel Rossetti to William Allingham, 1854–1870" |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Wuthering Heights'' has been seen as having elements of [[gothic fiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/gothic-elements-in-wuthering-heights.html|title=Gothic Elements in Wuthering Heights |website=Study.com|publisher=|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another significant aspect is the moorland setting.  The novel has inspired adaptations, including film, radio and television dramatisations, a musical, a ballet, operas, and a [[Wuthering Heights (song)|song]] by [[Kate Bush]].

==Plot==

===Opening (chapters 1 to 3)===
In 1801, [[Lockwood (Wuthering Heights)|Lockwood]], a wealthy young man from the South of England, who is seeking peace and recuperation, rents Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire. He visits his [[landlord]], [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]], who lives in a remote [[moorland]] farmhouse, [[Wuthering Heights (fictional location)|Wuthering Heights]]. There Lockwood finds an odd assemblage: Heathcliff, who seems to be a gentleman, but his manners are uncouth; the reserved mistress of the house, who is in her mid-teens; and a young man, who seems to be a member of the family, yet dresses and speaks as if he is a servant.

Snowed in, Lockwood is grudgingly allowed to stay and is shown to a bedchamber, where he notices books and graffiti left by a former inhabitant named [[Catherine Earnshaw|Catherine]]. He falls asleep and has a nightmare, in which he sees the ghostly Catherine trying to enter through the window. He cries out in fear, rousing Heathcliff, who rushes into the room. Lockwood is convinced that what he saw was real. Heathcliff, believing Lockwood to be right, examines the window and opens it, hoping to allow Catherine's spirit to enter. When nothing happens, Heathcliff shows Lockwood to his own bedroom and returns to keep watch at the window.

At sunrise, Heathcliff escorts Lockwood back to Thrushcross Grange. After his visit to the Heights, Lockwood becomes ill and is confined to his bed for some length of time. The Grange housekeeper, [[Ellen (Nelly) Dean]], who is looking after him, tells him the story of the family at the Heights during his convalescence.

=== Heathcliff's childhood (chapters 4 to 17) ===
Thirty years earlier, the [[landed property|owner]] of Wuthering Heights was Mr. Earnshaw, who lived with his son [[Hindley Earnshaw|Hindley]] and younger daughter Catherine. On a trip to [[Liverpool]], Earnshaw encounters a homeless boy, described as a "dark-skinned gypsy in aspect". He adopts the boy and names him Heathcliff. Hindley feels that Heathcliff has supplanted him in his father's affections and becomes bitterly [[jealous]]. Catherine and Heathcliff become friends and spend hours each day playing on the moors. They grow close.

Hindley is sent to university/college. Three years later Earnshaw dies, and Hindley becomes the landowner; he is now master of Wuthering Heights. He returns to live there with his new wife, Frances. He allows Heathcliff to stay, but only as a servant, and regularly mistreats him.

[[File:The Climb to Top Withens. - geograph.org.uk - 393405.jpg|thumb|left|The climb to Top Withens, thought to have inspired the Earnshaws' home in ''Wuthering Heights'']]

A few months after Hindley's return, Heathcliff and Catherine walk to Thrushcross Grange to spy on [[Edgar Linton|Edgar]] and Isabella Linton, who live there. After being discovered, they try to run away, but are caught. Catherine is injured by the Lintons' dog and taken into the house to recuperate, while Heathcliff is sent home. Catherine stays with the Lintons. The Lintons are [[landed gentry]], and Catherine is influenced by their elegant appearance and genteel manners. When she returns to Wuthering Heights, her appearance and manners are more ladylike, and she laughs at Heathcliff's unkempt appearance. The next day, knowing that the Lintons are to visit, Heathcliff, upon Nelly's advice, tries to dress up, in an effort to impress Catherine, but he and Edgar get into an argument, and Hindley humiliates Heathcliff by locking him in the attic. Catherine tries to comfort Heathcliff, but he vows revenge on Hindley.

The following year, Frances Earnshaw gives birth to a son, named [[Hareton Earnshaw|Hareton]], but she dies a few months later. Hindley descends into drunkenness. Two more years pass, and Catherine and Edgar Linton become friends, while she becomes more distant from Heathcliff. Edgar visits Catherine while Hindley is away, and they declare themselves lovers soon afterwards.

Catherine confesses to Nelly that Edgar has proposed marriage and she has accepted, although her love for Edgar is not comparable to her love for Heathcliff, whom she cannot marry because of his low social status and lack of education. She hopes to use her position as Edgar's wife to raise Heathcliff's standing. Heathcliff overhears her say that it would "degrade" her to marry him (but not how much she loves him), and he runs away and disappears without a trace. Distraught over Heathcliff's departure, Catherine makes herself ill. Nelly and Edgar begin to pander to her every whim to prevent her from becoming ill again.

Three years pass. Edgar and Catherine marry and go to live together at Thrushcross Grange, where Catherine enjoys being "lady of the manor". Six months later, Heathcliff returns, now a wealthy gentleman. Catherine is delighted, but Edgar is not. Edgar's sister, [[Isabella Linton|Isabella]], soon falls in love with Heathcliff, who despises her, but encourages the infatuation as a means of revenge. This leads to an argument with Catherine at Thrushcross Grange, which Edgar overhears. Finally, enraged by Heathcliff's constant appearance and foul parlance, he forbids Heathcliff from visiting Catherine altogether. Upset, Catherine locks herself in her room and begins to make herself ill again.  She is also now pregnant with Edgar's child.

Heathcliff takes up residence at Wuthering Heights and spends his time gambling with Hindley and teaching Hareton bad habits. Hindley dissipates his wealth and mortgages the farmhouse to Heathcliff to pay his debts. Heathcliff elopes with Isabella Linton. Two months after their elopement, Heathcliff and Isabella return to Wuthering Heights, where Heathcliff discovers that Catherine is dying. With Nelly's help, he visits Catherine secretly. The following day, she gives birth to a daughter, [[Catherine Linton|Cathy]], shortly before dying. While Catherine is lying in her coffin overnight, prior to the funeral, Heathcliff returns and replaces the lock of Edgar's hair in her necklace with a lock of his own.

Shortly after the funeral, Isabella leaves Heathcliff and finds refuge in the South of England. She gives birth to a son, Linton. Hindley dies six months after Catherine, and Heathcliff thus finds himself master of Wuthering Heights.

=== Heathcliff's maturity (chapters 18 to 31) ===
[[File:TopWithensPlaque.jpg|right|thumb|200x|Brontë Society plaque at Top Withens]]

Twelve years pass. Catherine's daughter, Cathy, has become a beautiful, high-spirited girl. Edgar learns that his sister Isabella is dying, so he leaves to retrieve her son Linton in order to adopt and educate him. Cathy, who has rarely left home, takes advantage of her father's absence to venture further afield. She rides over the moors to Wuthering Heights and discovers that she has not one but two cousins: Hareton, in addition to Linton. She also lets it be known that her father has gone to fetch Linton. When Edgar returns with Linton, a weak and sickly boy, Heathcliff insists that he live at Wuthering Heights.

Three years pass. Walking on the moors, Nelly and Cathy encounter Heathcliff, who takes them to Wuthering Heights to see Linton and Hareton. Heathcliff hopes that Linton and Cathy will marry, so that Linton will become the heir to Thrushcross Grange. Linton and Cathy begin a secret friendship, echoing the childhood friendship between their respective parents, Heathcliff and Catherine. Nelly finds out about the letters.

The following year, Edgar becomes very ill and takes a turn for the worse while Nelly and Cathy are out on the moors, where Heathcliff and Linton trick them into entering Wuthering Heights. Heathcliff keeps them captive to enable the marriage of Cathy and Linton to take place. After five days, Nelly is released, and later, with Linton's help, Cathy escapes. She returns to the Grange to see her father shortly before he dies.

Now master of both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange, Cathy's father-in-law, Heathcliff, insists on her returning to live at Wuthering Heights. Soon after she arrives, Linton dies. Hareton tries to be kind to Cathy, but she withdraws from the world.

At this point, Nelly's tale catches up to the present day (1801). Time passes and, after being ill for a period, Lockwood grows tired of the moors and informs Heathcliff that he will be leaving Thrushcross Grange.

=== Ending (chapters 32 to 34) ===
Eight months later, Lockwood returns to the area by chance. Given that his tenancy at Thrushcross Grange is still valid, he decides to stay there again. He finds Nelly living at Wuthering Heights and enquires what has happened since he left. She explains that she moved to Wuthering Heights to replace the housekeeper, Zillah, who had left.

Hareton has an accident and is confined to the farmhouse. During his convalescence, he and Cathy overcome their mutual antipathy and become close. While their friendship develops, Heathcliff begins to act strangely and has visions of Catherine. He stops eating and, after four days of increasingly bad health, is found dead in Catherine's old room. He is buried next to Catherine.

Lockwood learns that Hareton and Cathy plan to marry on New Year's Day. As he gets ready to leave, he passes the graves of Catherine, Edgar, and Heathcliff and pauses to contemplate the quiet of the moors.

== Characters ==
* '''[[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]]''': Found, presumably orphaned, on the streets of Liverpool and taken by Mr. Earnshaw to Wuthering Heights, where he is reluctantly cared for by the family. He and Catherine grow close and their love is the central theme of the first volume. His revenge against the man she chooses to marry and its consequences are the central theme of the second volume. Heathcliff has been considered a [[Byronic hero]], but critics have pointed out that he reinvents himself at various points, making his character hard to fit into any single type. He has an ambiguous position in society, and his lack of status is underlined by the fact that "Heathcliff" is both his given name and his surname.
* '''[[Catherine Earnshaw]]''': First introduced to the reader after her death, through Lockwood's discovery of her diary and carvings. The description of her life is confined almost entirely to the first volume. She seems unsure whether she is, or wants to become, more like Heathcliff, or aspires to be more like Edgar. Some critics have argued that her decision to marry Edgar Linton is allegorically a rejection of nature and a surrender to culture, a choice with unfortunate, fateful consequences for all the other characters.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Sandra M. and Susan Gubar. ''The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Imagination''. New Haven: Yale UP, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Edgar Linton]]''': Introduced as a child in the Linton family, he resides at Thrushcross Grange. Edgar's style and manners are in sharp contrast to those of Heathcliff, who instantly dislikes him, and of Catherine, who is drawn to him. Catherine marries him instead of Heathcliff because of his higher social status, with disastrous results to all characters in the story.
* '''[[Nelly Dean]]''': The main narrator of the novel, Nelly is a servant to three generations of the Earnshaws and two of the Linton family. Humbly born, she regards herself nevertheless as Hindley's foster-sister (they are the same age and her mother is his nurse). She lives and works among the rough inhabitants of Wuthering Heights, but is well-read, and she also experiences the more genteel manners of Thrushcross Grange. She is referred to as Ellen, her given name, to show respect, and as Nelly among those close to her. Critics have discussed how far her actions as an apparent bystander affect the other characters and how much her narrative can be relied on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harley|first1=James|year=1958|title=''The Villain in'' Wuthering Heights|journal=|volume=|issue=|page=17|url=http://livingston.schoolwires.com/139620929192030233/lib/139620929192030233/_files/Ellen_Dean_as_villain.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=3 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67kfe5LMS?url=http://livingston.schoolwires.com/139620929192030233/lib/139620929192030233/_files/Ellen_Dean_as_villain.pdf|archivedate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Isabella Linton]]''': Isabella is seen only in relation to other characters, although some insight into her thoughts and feelings is provided by the chapter, a long letter to Ellen, detailing her arrival at Wuthering Heights after her marriage to Heathcliff. She views Heathcliff romantically, despite Catherine's warnings, and becomes an unwitting participant in his plot for revenge against Edgar. Heathcliff marries her, but treats her abusively. While pregnant, she escapes to London and gives birth to a son, Linton.
* '''[[Hindley Earnshaw]]''': Catherine's elder brother, Hindley, despises Heathcliff immediately and bullies him throughout their childhood before his father sends him away to college. Hindley returns with his wife, Frances, after Mr Earnshaw dies. He is more mature, but his hatred of Heathcliff remains the same. After Frances's death, Hindley reverts to destructive behaviour and ruins the Earnshaw family by drinking and gambling to excess. Heathcliff beats up Hindley at one point after Hindley fails in his attempt to kill Heathcliff with a pistol.
* '''[[Hareton Earnshaw]]''': The son of Hindley and Frances, raised at first by Nelly but soon by Heathcliff. Nelly works to instill a sense of pride in the Earnshaw heritage (even though Hareton will not inherit Earnshaw property, because Hindley has mortgaged it to Heathcliff). Heathcliff, in contrast, teaches him vulgarities, as a way of avenging himself on Hindley. Hareton speaks with an accent similar to Joseph's, and occupies a position similar to a servant at Wuthering Heights, unaware how he has been done out of his inheritance. In appearance he reminds Heathcliff of his aunt, Catherine.
* '''[[Catherine Linton|Cathy Linton]]''': The daughter of Catherine and Edgar, a spirited and strong-willed girl unaware of her parents' history. Edgar is very protective of her and as a result she is eager to discover what lies beyond the confines of the Grange. Although one of the more sympathetic characters of the novel, she is also somewhat snobbish against Hareton and his lack of education.
* '''Linton Heathcliff''': The son of Heathcliff and Isabella. A weak child, his early years are spent with his mother in the south of England. He learns of his father's identity and existence only after his mother dies, when he is twelve. In his selfishness and capacity for cruelty he resembles Heathcliff. Physically he resembles his mother. He marries Cathy Linton because his father, who terrifies him, directs him to do so, and soon after dies from a wasting illness associated with tuberculosis.
* '''Joseph''': A servant at Wuthering Heights for 60 years who is a rigid, self-righteous Christian but lacks any trace of genuine kindness or humanity. He speaks a broad Yorkshire dialect and hates nearly everyone in the novel.
* '''[[Lockwood (Wuthering Heights)|Mr Lockwood]]''': The first narrator, he rents Thrushcross Grange to escape society, but in the end decides society is preferable. He narrates the book until Chapter 4, when the main narrator, Nelly, picks up the tale.
* '''Frances''': Hindley's ailing wife and mother of Hareton Earnshaw. She is described as somewhat silly and is obviously from humble family backgrounds.
* '''Mr and Mrs Earnshaw''': Catherine's and Hindley's father, Mr Earnshaw is the master of Wuthering Heights at the beginning of Nelly's story and is described as an irascible but loving and kind-hearted man. He favours his adopted son, Heathcliff, which causes trouble in the family. In contrast, his wife mistrusts Heathcliff from their first encounter.
* '''Mr and Mrs Linton''': Edgar's and Isabella's parents, they educate their children in a well-behaved and sophisticated way. Mr Linton also serves as the magistrate of Gimmerton, like his son in later years.
* '''Dr Kenneth''': The longtime doctor of Gimmerton and a friend of Hindley's who is present at the cases of illness during the novel. Although not much of his character is known, he seems to be a rough but honest person.
* '''Zillah''': A servant to Heathcliff at Wuthering Heights during the period following Catherine's death. Although she is kind to Lockwood, she doesn't like or help Cathy at Wuthering Heights because of Cathy's arrogance and Heathcliff's instructions.
* '''Mr Green''': Edgar's corruptible lawyer who should have changed Edgar's will to prevent Heathcliff from gaining Thrushcross Grange. But Green changes sides and helps Heathcliff to inherit Grange as his property.

==Gothic novel==
{{Expand-section|date=June 2018}}
[[Ellen Moers]], in ''Literary Women'', developed a feminist theory that connects women writers, including Emily Brontë, with the [[gothic fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;Moers, Ellen. ''Literary Women: The Great Writers'' [1976] (London: The Women's Press, 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine Earnshaw has been identified by some critics as a type of gothic demon, because she "[[shape-shifts]]" in order to marry Edgar Linton, by assuming a domesticity, which is contrary to her true nature.&lt;ref&gt;Beauvais, Jennifer. [http://www.erudit.org/revue/ron/2006/v/n44/013999ar.html "Domesticity and the Female Demon in Charlotte Dacre's Zofloya and Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights"], ''Romanticism on the Net'', Numéro 44, novembre 2006, DOI: 10.7202/013999ar.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that Catherine's relationship with Heathcliff conforms to the "dynamics of the Gothic romance, in that the woman falls prey to the more or less demonic instincts of her lover, suffers from the violence of his feelings, and at the end is entangled by his thwarted passion".&lt;ref&gt;Cristina Ceron, Christina. [http://lisa.revues.org/3504 "Emily and Charlotte Brontë's Re-reading of the Byronic hero"], ''Revue LISA/LISA e-journal'', Writers, writings, Literary studies, document 2, 9 March 2010, DOI : 10.4000/lisa.3504.&lt;/ref&gt;

At one stage Heathcliff is described as a vampire, and it has been suggested that both he and Catherine are in fact meant to be seen as vampire like personalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SIRe5dJULv8C&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Wuthering+Heights+++vampire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje6PnDgenWAhUKbBoKHT6WAFoQ6AEIVzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Wuthering+Heights+++vampire&amp;f=false|title=Demon-lovers and Their Victims in British Fiction|first=Toni|last=Reed|date=30 July 1988|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|accessdate=30 July 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RdqOAb5NA5wC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Wuthering+Heights+++vampire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiVvfG3_-jWAhUG0xoKHfp9BLQQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Wuthering+Heights+++vampire&amp;f=false|title=The Vampire in Nineteenth Century English Literature|first=Carol A.|last=Senf|date=1 February 2013|publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres|accessdate=30 July 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==

=== 1847 edition ===
The original text, as published by Thomas Cautley Newby in 1847,  is available online in two parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/wutheringheights01bron#page/n5/mode/2up|title=Wuthering heights. A novel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/wutheringheights02bron#page/n5/mode/2up|title=Wuthering heights. A novel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was first published together with Anne Brontë's ''Agnes Grey'' in a three-volume format: ''Wuthering Heights'' occupied the first two volumes, while ''Agnes Grey'' made up the third.

===1850 edition===
In 1850, when a second edition of ''Wuthering Heights'' was due, Charlotte Brontë edited the original text, altering punctuation, correcting spelling errors and making Joseph's thick Yorkshire dialect less opaque. Writing to her publisher, W.S. Williams, she mentioned that "It seems to me advisable to modify the orthography of the old servant Joseph's speeches; for though, as it stands, it exactly renders the Yorkshire dialect to a Yorkshire ear, yet I am sure Southerns must find it unintelligible; and thus one of the most graphic characters in the book is lost on them." An essay written by Irene Wiltshire on dialect and speech in the novel examines some of the changes Charlotte made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campuses.fortbendisd.com/campuses/documents/teacher/2009/teacher_20090122_1239_3.pdf Irene Wiltshire: Speech in Wuthering Heights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202234803/http://campuses.fortbendisd.com/campuses/documents/teacher/2009/teacher_20090122_1239_3.pdf |date=2 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration for locations==
[[File:High Sunderland Hall 1818.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[High Sunderland Hall]] in 1818, shortly before Emily Brontë saw the building.]]
There are several theories about which real building or buildings (if any) may have inspired Wuthering Heights. One common candidate is [[Top Withens]], a ruined farmhouse in an isolated area near the [[Haworth Parsonage]], although its structure does not match that of the farmhouse described in the novel.&lt;ref name="inspirations"&gt;{{cite web | author=Paul Thompson| title=Wuthering Heights: The Home of the Earnshaws | url=https://www.wuthering-heights.co.uk/locations/wuthering-heights#inspirations |date=June 2009 | accessdate=11 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Top Withens was first suggested as the model by Ellen Nussey, a friend of [[Charlotte Brontë]], to Edward Morison Wimperis, an artist who was commissioned to illustrate the Brontë sisters' novels in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Paul Thompson| title=The Inspiration for the Wuthering Heights Farmhouse? | url=https://www.wuthering-heights.co.uk/locations/top-withens |date=June 2009| accessdate=11 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second possibility is [[High Sunderland Hall]], near [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], now demolished.&lt;ref name="inspirations" /&gt; This Gothic edifice was located near Law Hill, where Emily worked briefly as a governess in 1838. While it was perhaps grander than Wuthering Heights, the hall had grotesque embellishments of griffins and misshapen nude males similar to those described by Lockwood in Chapter 1 of the novel.

The inspiration for Thrushcross Grange has long been traced to [[Ponden Hall]], near Haworth, which is very small. [[Shibden Hall]], near Halifax, is perhaps more likely.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Barnard (2000) ''Emily Brontë''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Jack (1995) Explanatory Notes in Oxford World's Classics edition of ''Wuthering Heights''&lt;/ref&gt; The Thrushcross Grange that Emily describes is rather unusual. It sits within an enormous park, as does Shibden Hall. By comparison, the park at Chatsworth (the home of the Duke of Devonshire) is over two miles (3.2&amp;nbsp;km) long but, as the house sits near the middle, it is no more than a mile and a half (2.4&amp;nbsp;km) from the lodge to the house. Considering that Edgar Linton apparently does not even have a title, this seems unlikely. There is no building close to Haworth that has a park anywhere near this size, but there are a few houses that might have inspired some elements. Shibden Hall has several features that match descriptions in the novel.

== Critical response ==

=== Early reviews (1847–1848) ===
Early reviews of ''Wuthering Heights'' were mixed in their assessment. Whilst most critics at the time recognised the power and imagination of the novel, they were also baffled by the storyline and found the characters prone to savagery and selfishness.&lt;ref&gt;Joudrey, Thomas J. "'Well, we must be for ourselves in the long run': Selfishness and Sociality in ''Wuthering Heights''." ''Nineteenth-Century Literature'' 70.2 (2015): 165-93.&lt;/ref&gt; Published in 1847, at a time when the background of the author was deemed to have an important impact on the story itself, many critics were also intrigued by the authorship of the novels.{{Citation needed|reason= Not in original note. Note was a table of contents|date=March 2017}} [[Henry Chorley]] of the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenæum]]'' said that it was a "disagreeable story" and that the "Bells" (Brontës) "seem to affect painful and exceptional subjects".

The ''Atlas'' review called it a "strange, inartistic story," but commented that every chapter seems to contain a "sort of rugged power." ''Atlas'' summarised the novel by writing: "We know nothing in the whole range of our fictitious literature which presents such shocking pictures of the worst forms of humanity. There is not in the entire dramatis persona, a single character which is not utterly hateful or thoroughly contemptible&amp;nbsp;... Even the female characters excite something of loathing and much of contempt. Beautiful and loveable in their childhood, they all, to use a vulgar expression, "turn out badly"."&lt;ref name="Publication Stir"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8396278/How-Wuthering-Heights-caused-a-critical-stir-when-first-published-in-1847.html|title=How Wuthering Heights caused a critical stir when first published in 1847|date=22 March 2011|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Graham's Lady Magazine'' wrote "How a human being could have attempted such a book as the present without committing suicide before he had finished a dozen chapters, is a mystery. It is a compound of vulgar depravity and unnatural horrors."&lt;ref name="Publication Stir"/&gt;

''The American Whig Review'' wrote "Respecting a book so original as this, and written with so much power of imagination, it is natural that there should be many opinions. Indeed, its power is so predominant that it is not easy after a hasty reading to analyze one's impressions so as to speak of its merits and demerits with confidence. We have been taken and carried through a new region, a melancholy waste, with here and there patches of beauty; have been brought in contact with fierce passions, with extremes of love and hate, and with sorrow that none but those who have suffered can understand. This has not been accomplished with ease, but with an ill-mannered contempt for the decencies of language, and in a style which might resemble that of a Yorkshire farmer who should have endeavored to eradicate his provincialism by taking lessons of a London footman. We have had many sad bruises and tumbles in our journey, yet it was interesting, and at length we are safely arrived at a happy conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=amwh;cc=amwh;rgn=full%20text;idno=amwh0007-6;didno=volume;view=image;seq=610;node=amwh0007-6%3A1;page=root;size=100|title=The American Whig Review Volume 0007 Issue 6 (June 1848)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Douglas Jerrold's Weekly Newspaper'' wrote "Wuthering Heights is a strange sort of book,—baffling all regular criticism; yet, it is impossible to begin and not finish it; and quite as impossible to lay it aside afterwards and say nothing about. In Wuthering Heights the reader is shocked, disgusted, almost sickened by details of cruelty, inhumanity, and the most diabolical hate and vengeance, and anon come passages of powerful testimony to the supreme power of love&amp;nbsp;– even over demons in the human form. The women in the book are of a strange fiendish-angelic nature, tantalising, and terrible, and the men are indescribable out of the book itself. Yet, towards the close of the story occurs the following pretty, soft picture, which comes like the rainbow after a storm&amp;nbsp;... We strongly recommend all our readers who love novelty to get this story, for we can promise them that they never have read anything like it before. It is very puzzling and very interesting, and if we had space we would willingly devote a little more time to the analysis of this remarkable story, but we must leave it to our readers to decide what sort of book it is."&lt;ref name="Critical reception"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wuthering-heights.co.uk/reviews |title=What critics said about Wuthering Heights|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''New Monthly Magazine'' wrote "Wuthering Heights, by Ellis Bell, is a terrific story, associated with an equally fearful and repulsive spot&amp;nbsp;... Our novel reading experience does not enable us to refer to anything to be compared with the personages we are introduced to at this desolate spot&amp;nbsp;– a perfect misanthropist's heaven."&lt;ref name="Critical reception"/&gt;

''Tait's Edinburgh Magazine'' wrote "This novel contains undoubtedly powerful writing, and yet it seems to be thrown away. Mr. Ellis Bell, before constructing the novel, should have known that forced marriages, under threats and in confinement are illegal, and parties instrumental thereto can be punished. And second, that wills made by young ladies' minors are invalid. The volumes are powerfully written records of wickedness and they have a moral&amp;nbsp;– they show what Satan could do with the law of Entail."&lt;ref name="Critical reception"/&gt;

''Examiner'' wrote "This is a strange book. It is not without evidences of considerable power: but, as a whole, it is wild, confused, disjointed, and improbable; and the people who make up the drama, which is tragic enough in its consequences, are savages ruder than those who lived before the days of [[Homer]]."&lt;ref name="Critical reception"/&gt;

''Literary World'' wrote "In the whole story not a single trait of character is elicited which can command our admiration, not one of the fine feelings of our nature seems to have formed a part in the composition of its principal actors. In spite of the disgusting coarsness of much of the dialogue, and the improbabilities of much of the plot, we are spellbound."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=W76TqSDM0vYC&amp;pg=PA11|title=Reviews of "Wuthering Heights"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Britannia'' called it a "strangely original" book that depicts "humanity in this wild state." Although mostly hostile, it notes that the book is "illuminated by some gleams of sunshine towards the end which serve to cast a grateful light on the dreary path we have traveled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.123helpme.com/view.asp?id=38688|title=Wuthering Heights  ::  Free Essays Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G.H. Lewes]], in ''[[Leader Magazine|Leader]]'', shortly after Emily's death, wrote: "Curious enough is to read ''Wuthering Heights'' and ''[[The Tenant of Wildfell Hall]]'', and remember that the writers were two retiring, solitary, consumptive girls! Books, coarse even for men, coarse in language and coarse in conception, the coarseness apparently of violence and uncultivated men – turn out to be the productions of two girls living almost alone, filling their loneliness with quiet studies, and writing their books from a sense of duty, hating the pictures they drew, yet drawing them with austere conscientiousness! There is matter here for the moralist or critic to speculate on".&lt;ref&gt;Allott, ''The Brontes: The Critical Heritage'', p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laurence Olivier Merle Oberon Wuthering Heights.jpg|thumb|[[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Merle Oberon]] in the 1939 film ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'']]
The earliest known film adaptation of ''Wuthering Heights'' was filmed in England in 1920 and it was directed by [[A. V. Bramble]]. It is unknown if any prints still exist.&lt;ref name="imdb1920"&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0011886|title=Wuthering Heights|description=(1920)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous was 1939's ''[[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Wuthering Heights]]'', starring [[Laurence Olivier]] and [[Merle Oberon]] and directed by [[William Wyler]]. This acclaimed adaptation, like many others, eliminated the second generation's story (young Cathy, Linton and Hareton) and is rather inaccurate as a literary adaptation. It won the 1939 [[New York Film Critics Circle Award]] for Best Film and was nominated for the 1939 [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].

In 1967 the BBC produced a dramatisation starring [[Ian McShane]] and [[Angela Scoular]].

The [[Wuthering Heights (1970 film)|1970 film]] with [[Timothy Dalton]] as Heathcliff is the first colour version of the novel, and gained acceptance over the years though it was initially poorly received. The character of Hindley is portrayed much more sympathetically, and his story-arc is altered. It also subtly suggests that Heathcliff may be Cathy's illegitimate half-brother.

In 1978 the BBC produced a five-part TV serialisation of the book starring Ken Hutchinson, Kay Adshead and John Duttine with music by Carl Davis; it is considered one of the most faithful adaptations of Emily Brontë's story.

There is also a 1985 French film adaptation ''[[Hurlevent]]'' by [[Jacques Rivette]].

The 1992 film ''[[Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights]]'' starring [[Ralph Fiennes]] and [[Juliette Binoche]] is notable for including the oft-omitted second generation story of the children of Cathy, Hindley and Heathcliff.

More recent film or TV adaptations include [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s 2009 [[Wuthering Heights (2009 television serial)|two-part drama series]] starring [[Tom Hardy]], [[Charlotte Riley]], [[Sarah Lancashire]], and [[Andrew Lincoln]],&lt;ref name="imdb2009"&gt;{{IMDb title|id=1238834|title=Wuthering Heights|description=2009(TV))}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Wuthering Heights (2011 film)|2011 film]] starring [[Kaya Scodelario]] and James Howson and directed by [[Andrea Arnold]].

Adaptations which reset the story in a new setting include the [[Wuthering Heights (1953 film)|1953 adaptation]] retitled ''Abismos de Pasion'' directed by Spanish filmmaker [[Luis Buñuel]] set in Catholic Mexico, with Heathcliff and Cathy renamed Alejandro and Catalina. In Buñuel's version Heathcliff/Alejandro claims to have become rich by making a deal with Satan. The ''New York Times'' reviewed a re-release of this film as "an almost magical example of how an artist of genius can take someone else's classic work and shape it to fit his own temperament without really violating it," noting that the film was thoroughly Spanish and Catholic in its tone while still highly faithful to Brontë.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C03EFD91538F934A15751C1A965948260 |title=Abismos de Pasion (1953) Bunuel's Brontë|author=Vincent Canby |date=27 December 1983 |work= |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoshishige Yoshida]]'s [[Wuthering Heights (1988 film)|1988 adaptation]] also has a transposed setting, this time in medieval Japan. In Yoshida's version, the Heathcliff character, Onimaru, is raised in a nearby community of priests who worship a local fire god. Filipino director Carlos Siguion-Reyna made a film adaptation entitled Hihintayin Kita sa Langit (1991). The screenplay was written by Raquel Villavicencio. It starred [[Richard Gomez]] as Gabriel (Heathcliff) and [[Dawn Zulueta]] as Carmina (Catherine). It became a Filipino film classic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manunuri.com/filmography/hihintayin_kita_sa_langit|title=Hihintayin Kita sa Langit (1991) - Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino (MPP)|website=www.manunuri.com|accessdate=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, MTV produced a poorly reviewed [[Wuthering Heights (2003 film)|version]] set in a modern California high school.

The 1966 [[India]]n film ''[[Dil Diya Dard Liya]]'' is based upon this novel. The film is directed by [[Abdul Rashid Kardar]] and [[Dilip Kumar]]. The film stars the thespian [[Dilip Kumar]], [[Waheeda Rehman]], [[Pran (actor)|Pran]], [[Rehman (actor)|Rehman]], [[Shyama]] and [[Johnny Walker (actor)|Johnny Walker]]. The music is by the legendary composer [[Naushad]]. Although it did not fare as well as other movies of Dilip Kumar, it was well received by critics.

The novel has been popular in opera and theatre, including operas written by [[Bernard Herrmann]], [[Carlisle Floyd]], and [[Frédéric Chaslin]] (most cover only the first half of the book) and a musical by [[Bernard J. Taylor]].

In 2011, a [[graphic novel]] version was published by Classical Comics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicalcomics.com/ |title=Classical Comics |publisher=Classical Comics |date= |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stays close to the original novel. It was adapted by Scottish writer [[Sean Michael Wilson]] and hand painted by comic book veteran artist John M Burns. This version received a nomination for the Stan Lee Excelsior Awards, voted by pupils from 170 schools in the United Kingdom.

== Works inspired ==

[[Kate Bush]]'s song "[[Wuthering Heights (song)|Wuthering Heights]]" is most likely the best-known creative work inspired by Brontë's story that is not properly an "adaptation". Bush wrote and released the song when she was 18 and chose it as the lead single in her debut album (despite the record company preferring another track as the lead single). It was primarily inspired by the [[Wuthering Heights (1939 film)|Olivier–Oberon film version]], which deeply affected Bush in her teenage years. The song is sung from Catherine's point of view as she pleads at Heathcliff's window to be admitted. It uses quotations from Catherine, both in the chorus ("Let me in! I'm so cold!") and the verses, with Catherine's admitting she had "bad dreams in the night". Critic Sheila Whiteley wrote that the ethereal quality of the vocal resonates with Cathy's dementia, and that Bush's high register has both "childlike qualities in its purity of tone" and an "underlying eroticism in its sinuous erotic contours".Singer Pat Benatar also released the song in 1980 on the "Crimes of Passion" album. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Too much too young: popular music, age and gender |last=Whiteley |first=Sheila |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=Psychology Press |location= |isbn=0-415-31029-6 |page=9 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


''[[Wind &amp; Wuthering]]'' (1976) by English rock band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] alludes to the Brontë novel not only in the album's title but also in the titles of two of its tracks, "Unquiet Slumbers for the Sleepers..." and "...In That Quiet Earth". Both titles refer to the closing lines in the novel.

Songwriter [[Jim Steinman]] said that he wrote the song "[[It's All Coming Back To Me Now]]" "while under the influence of ''Wuthering Heights''". He said that the song was "about being enslaved and obsessed by love" and compared it to "Heathcliffe digging up Kathy's corpse and dancing with it in the cold moonlight".&lt;ref name="artist"&gt;{{cite web |work=JimSteinman.com |title=Jim Steinman on "It's All Coming Back to Me Now" |url=http://www.jimsteinman.com/backtome.htm |accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song "[[Cath...|Cath]]" by [[indie rock]] band [[Death Cab for Cutie]] was inspired by ''Wuthering Heights''.

The poem "Wuthering" (2017) by [[Tanya Grae]] uses ''Wuthering Heights'' as an allegory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grae |first1=Tanya |title=Wuthering |journal=Cordite Poetry Review |date=2017 |volume=57 |issue=Confession |url=https://cordite.org.au/poetry/confession/wuthering/ |issn=1328-2107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maryse Condé]]'s ''Windward Heights'' (''La migration des coeurs'', published in 1995; English translation published in 1998) is a reworking of ''Wuthering Heights'' set in [[Cuba]] and [[Guadaloupe]] at the turn of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tepper |first1=Anderson |title=Windward Heights |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/09/05/bib/990905.rv103554.html |publisher=New York Times |date=5 September 1999 |accessdate=10 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Condé stated she intended as an homage to Brontë.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/2248/ |last=Wolff |first=Rebecca |title=Maryse Condé |publisher=BOMB Magazine |accessdate=10 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101132353/http://bombmagazine.org/article/2248 |archive-date=1 November 2016 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Minae Mizumura|Mizumura Minae]]'s ''[[A True Novel]]'' (''Honkaku shosetsu'', published in 2002 by Shinchosha; English translation by [[Juliet Winters Carpenter]] published by Other Press in 2013) is inspired by ''Wuthering Heights'' and might be called an adaptation of the story in a post-World War II Japanese setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/books/review/a-true-novel-by-minae-mizumura.html?_r=0 |last=Chira |first=Susan |title=Strange Moors: 'A True Novel' by Minae Mizuma |publisher=The New York Times |date=13 December 2013 |accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Jane Urquhart]]'s ''Changing Heaven'', the novel ''Wuthering Heights'', as well as the ghost of Emily Brontë, feature as prominent roles in the narrative.

The song "[[Cover My Eyes (Pain and Heaven)]]" by the band [[Marillion]] includes the line "Like the girl in the novel in the wind on the moors".

The song "Emily" by [[Folk Music|folk]] artist [[Billie Marten]] is written from Brontë's perspective. Marten wrote the song while studying ''Wuthering Heights''.

Canadian author [[Hilary Cunningham Scharper|Hilary Scharper]]'s ecogothic novel ''Perdita'' (2013) was deeply influenced by ''Wuthering Heights,'' namely in terms of the narrative role of powerful, cruel and desolate landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Douglas, [http://www.criticsatlarge.ca/2014/02/the-eco-gothic-hilary-scharpers-perdita.html "The Eco-Gothic: Hilary Scharper's Perdita"], ''Critics at Large'', 19
