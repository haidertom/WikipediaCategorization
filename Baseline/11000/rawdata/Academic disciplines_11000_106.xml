      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23356">'''Adapted physical education''' ('''APE''') is the art and science of developing, implementing, and monitoring a carefully designed [[physical education]] instructional program for a learner with a disability, based on a comprehensive assessment, to give the learner the skills necessary for a lifetime of rich leisure, recreation, and sport experiences to enhance physical fitness and wellness. Principles and Methods of Adapted Physical Education and Recreation.Adapted physical education generally refers to school-based programs for students ages 3–21.

Federal law mandates that physical education be provided to students with disabilities. Physical Education is defined as the development of physical and motor skills, fundamental motor skills and patterns, skills in aquatics, dance and individual and group games and sports; including intramural and lifetime sports.Adapted Physical Education National Standards - What is Adapted Physical Education?

==Adapted Physical Education National Standards (APENS)==
The [http://www.apens.org/ Adapted Physical Education National Standards] promotes qualified, nationally certified educators to provide physical education services to students with disabilities.

== Key legislation ==
===Education of all Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (P.L. 94–142)===
The history of Adapted Physical Education began with the implementation of [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act|P.L. 94–142]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="Auxter"&gt;[Auxter, D, Pyfer, J, Zittel, L, &amp; Roth, K. (Ed.). (2010). Principles and Methods of Adapted Physical Education and Recreation. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This act recognized physical education as a direct service. Specially designed physical education programs must be made available to every handicapped child receiving a [http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/edlite-FAPE504.html Free, Appropriate Public Education] (FAPE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhcs.k12.nc.us/sped/APE%20Pages/APE%20Web%20Page.htm – Adapted Physical Education- North Carolina Department of Instruction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719094032/http://www.nhcs.k12.nc.us/sped/APE%20Pages/APE%20Web%20Page.htm |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Americans with Disabilities Act (P.L. 101–336)===
The [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA) was enacted in 1990 to prohibit the discrimination of individuals with disabilities in the public and private sectors. The ADA outlaws discrimination against a person with a disability in five spheres: employment, public services, transportation, public accommodations, and telecommunications.  ADA requires accessibility in physical education facilities.  Examples include: Weight rooms that accommodate wheelchair users, gym lockers that use combination locks, playgrounds surrounded by a fence, and well lighted gymnasiums to aid students with visual impairments.&lt;ref name="Auxter" /&gt;

=== Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) ===
Enacted in 1990 (and reauthorized in 1997 and 2004), [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]] was the reauthorization of [[Education for All Handicapped Children Act|PL 94–142]] and continued the emphasis upon [[Free Appropriate Public Education|FAPE]], [[Individualized Education Program|IEP]], [[Least Restrictive Environment|LRE]], and [[physical education]] as a direct educational service. With this reauthorization, person-first terminology was instituted, and emphasis was placed on the education of students with disabilities within the general curriculum and parent involvement in educational programming. Under Federal Law, in order to qualify for this special education programming, students must fall within one of the thirteen disability categories identified under IDEA and demonstrate an academic need.

== Individual Education Program or IEP ==
An [[Individualized Education Program|Individualized Educational Plan]] (IEP) can be defined as a plan for each student, ages 3 to 21, who qualifies for special education services, based on an evaluation. All IEP's are outcome-oriented giving assurance that the student will benefit from special education and have real opportunities, full participation, independent living, and economic self-efficiency. If a student is receiving adapted physical education services, it must be identified on the IEP and APE goals should be developed and implemented. IEPs are revised once a year by an IEP team. Individuals with an IEP should receive a reevaluation every three years. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cesa7.org/sped/issues-IEPissues/procreevalIEP06.htm|title=Special Education Procedures for an IEP Re-evaluation|website=www.cesa7.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;IEP's are developed by the IEP team and based on comprehensive assessment as outlined by guidelines established in [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]].

=== Purpose ===
Federal law mandates that each student receiving special education and related services must have an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) developed for them.  An IEP must be designed and written specifically for one student, outlining individualized needs, and used to establish an appropriate educational placement. Some consider the IEP to be a "management" program to guide appropriate service delivery, which includes the area of physical education.  The IEP creates an opportunity for teachers, parents, school administrators, related services personnel and students (when appropriate) to work together to improve educational results for learners with disabilities.

=== Do all students with disabilities need an IEP for physical education? ===
No, IDEA 2004 mandates each individual with a disability have an IEP developed if necessary to benefit their education. If an appropriate assessment is completed and the IEP team decides the student is not safe and/or successful in general physical education without supplementary aids and services, then an IEP is developed and services provided. A student can have IEP goals related to physical education needs regardless of their educational placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pecentral.org/adapted/idea04.html|title=PE Central: Adapted Physical Education Web Sites|website=www.pecentral.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Placement options ===
What is the relationship between placement and the IEP?
:Decisions based on [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]] qualifications are generally discussed and determined during an [[Individualized Education Program|Individual Education Plan]] (IEP) meeting. IEP recommendations for services and supports must consider a student's unique needs, as well as the [[Least Restrictive Environment]] (LRE)."&lt;ref name="Conatser"&gt;Conatser, P., &amp; Summar, C. (2004, September/October). Individual Education Programs for Adapted Physical Education. Strategies, 18(1), 35–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The LRE will be based upon the assessment process and where the IEP goals can best be met. There are a variety of placement option which should be considered including:&lt;ref name="Auxter" /&gt;
:*Full-time General PE (GPE)
:*General PE with a younger class
:*Part-time Adapted PE (GPE for some units or parts of a lesson)
:*Reverse Mainstreaming
:*Small Group or One on One PE
:*Separate School
:*Home/Hospital

=== IEP/IPEP ===
IPEP stands for Individual Physical Education Program. It is a written document that parallels the IEP in form and content but is specific to physical education. Unlike the IEP, the IPEP is not a legal document. Instead, it is a summary of assessment data and needs of a student. An IPEP provides recommendations for placement, services, and the teaching and learning conditions that will be best suited for each student.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adapted Physical Activity, Recreation and Sport: Cross Disciplinary and Lifespan|last=Sherrill|first=Claudine|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies|year=1998|isbn=0-697-25887-4|location=United States|pages=145-146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Section 504 Plan ==
[[Section 504]] of the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]] protects the rights of individuals with disabilities in programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance, including federal funds. Section 504 provides that: “No otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States . . . shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance...&lt;ref&gt;[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 794. &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== What is the difference between an IEP and a Section 504 Plan? ===
If a student has one of the thirteen disabilities identified by [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act|IDEA]] and demonstrates an educational need, special services are provided. These services are guided by the IEP.  Students who do not meet the qualifications for IDEA but still have a disability and require some assistance to be able to participate in physical education would be candidates for a [[Section 504|Section 504 Plan]]. A Section 504 Plan spells out the modifications and accommodations that will be needed for these students to have an opportunity to perform at the same level as their peers (might include things like a wheelchair ramp, blood sugar monitoring, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wsfcs.k12.nc.us/Page/284&lt;!--|title=Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of technology ==
With the development of new and improved technology with [[physical education]], and especially adapted physical education, it is important for the APE teacher to know and understand different ways to implement technology for increased success for their students. APE teachers can develop an updated website regarding a fitness workout plan, in which students can download and follow at home with a sibling or parent. Students can be taught how to keep track of their physical fitness goals and record the data on a spreadsheet. Video files can also be used to demonstrate proper technique. Teachers can easily create videos of students doing an activity and download them onto an iPod or computer so students have an easily accessible reference to use during transition periods or after they graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncpad.org/videos/|title=NCHPAD's Recent Videos : Videos : NCHPAD - Building Inclusive Communities|website=National Center on Health, Physical Activity and Disability (NCHPAD)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video files or iMovies can be utilized as report cards or as evidence of IEP goal attainment. In APE pedometers can easily be introduced into any lesson and taught how to use and how to keep track of steps. Teachers can also play appropriate and motivating music for aerobic activities. Video games are also starting to become more and more predominant in physical education classes, such games can be used outside of school as well. Some games are particularly accessible for individuals with disabilities including Wii and Eye Toy Play. New applications (Apps) are constantly being created to assist people with disabilities in numerous ways.  With technology growing, APE teachers need to continue to develop as professionals in providing new ways to enhance their students physical development.

== &amp;nbsp;Teaching adapted physical education ==

=== Qualifications ===
Qualifications vary by state. In order to be qualified an educator must have met their state's approved or recognized certification, licensing, registration, or other comparable requirements. While these vary by state, there are national standards set in place to allow somebody to become a Certified Adapted Physical Education Professional or CAPE. These requirements include
* A bachelor's degree in physical education or equivalent (sport science, kinesiology, etc.)
* A minimum of 200 hours of practicum experiences in adapted physical education
* Completion of a minimum of 9 credits of coursework from a related field
* A valid teaching certificate in physical education
* Take the APENS National Certification Exam
While certification will certainly help educators create well-developed adapted physical education programs, there are no requirements for local school districts to hire CAPE's.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Teacher's Guide to Adapted Physical Education|last=Block|first=Martin|publisher=Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co.|year=2016|isbn=978-1-59857-669-6|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=68-74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Determining what to teach ===
A physical education instructor will assess the needs of the students considering their employment opportunities and living arrangements after graduation. This will allow them to create an adapted physical education curriculum for students following the ABC planning process. The steps in this process are as follows.
# Define the student's curriculum goals.
# Delineate the objectives for each curriculum goal.
# Determine the emphasis each goal should receive in the curriculum.
# Calculate the amount of time available.
# Calculate the average objective mastery time.
# Determine how much content can fit in the curriculum.
# Sequence the goals and objectives developmentally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===&amp;nbsp;Class format ===
Class format is defined as the way in which members of the class are organized. There are seven class formats that are most commonly used in adapted physical education settings.
# One-to-one instruction: one teacher or assistant for every student.
# Small group: 3-10 students working together with a teacher or assistant.
# Large group: entire class participating together as a group.
# Mixed group: using various class formats within one class period.
# Peer teaching or tutoring: using classmates or students without disabilities from other classes for teaching and assisting students with disabilities.
# Teaching stations: several areas in which smaller subsets for the class rotate to practice skills.
# Self-paced independent work: each student works on individual goals at his or her own pace following directions on task cards or with guidance from the teacher or assistant. &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Teacher's Guide to Adapted Physical Education|last=Block|first=Martin|publisher=Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co.|year=2016|isbn=978-1-59857-669-6|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Teachers must find the best class format to help the student achieve the goals for the lesson.

==&amp;nbsp;Teaching for specific disabilities ==

=== Intellectual Disabilities ===
There are a number of general modifications that can be applied in a physical education environment for students with intellectual disabilities.

The first set of modifications deal with communication. When instructing students use shorter sentences, use gestures or demonstrations as supplement to verbal cues, repeat directions and have students repeat directions back to you, provide praise often, and give more feedback.

The next set of modifications deal with practice. Give students extra practice trials, build in more time for a student to master skills, make sure activities are perceived as fun, promote active participation, shorten activities to reduce problems with attention span, and allow choices in what activity will be done, when it will be done, where it will take place, and with whom the child will participate in the activity with. One method to structure activities is known as level teaching. To accommodate for students with varying levels of intellectual disabilities a game will be designed with different levels. For example, if the specific sport is volleyball the instructor will set up 3 courts with different modifications at each court to accommodate for these varying levels of disability. Court 1 may have a set of cones designating opposing sides while Court 3 has a net set in place. Different rules may be applied to different courts as well, allowing every student to be challenged in a constructive way.

The third set of modifications deal with curriculum. Adjust the general education curriculum to meet the needs of a student. For example, reduce the number of objectives that need to be mastered. If a student is severely delayed, an entirely new curriculum may need to be made. Activities may also need to provide early success which will encourage adherence.

The final set of modifications deal with the environment. It should be structured and visually appealing. It is essential to reduce playing areas in order to eliminate distractions. Plan to structure the environment in a way that will allow you to deal with behavioral problems. &lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Teacher's Guide to Adapted Physical Education|last=Block|first=Martin|publisher=Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co.|year=2016|isbn=978-1-59857-669-6|location=Baltimore, Maryland|pages=234-258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning disabilities ===
1 in 5 students with learning disabilities will also have motor impairments. There are a number of ways to accommodate these students.

Reduce class size: This allows teacher extra one on one time with students. Often a class of 20-30 students proves to be more effective than double or triple that in general physical education classes.

Use peer tutors: Peers can be rained in how to provide specific skill feedback as well as modify activities so the student has higher success. This can be effective when class size cannot be reduced.

Offer learning strategies: Both teachers and peer tutors can provide strategies to help disorganized learners focus. This includes provided picture cues, video cues, and additional cues such as footprints on the floor to help a student understand what and how to perform an activity.

Provide structured practice: Allow the student to get many practice opportunities. This will help them learn how to listen to and observe visual feedback for performance.

Identify success: Reframe success for students in a way that does not focus on the end result. For example, using correct form in shooting should be a measure of success rather than making the basket.

Use a variety of senses when giving instructions: Some students do better listening to instruction while others do better watching a demonstration. Others may do best when physically guided into the pattern. By incorporating many types of learning styles, students will be more likely to succeed.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== ADHD ===
Students with [[attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder]] may experience motor learning delays. Many strategies are available to minimize learning delays in students with ADHD.

Positive feedback: There is a relationship between positive feedback given by a physical education teacher and students applying corrective feedback.

Task sheets: A task sheet provides a progression of activities to be completed by the students and requires them to record their results. Task sheets can be turned in at the end of class. This allows students to assess their performance while acknowledging their need to improve their skills.

Token economy or point system: This is a structured agreement between the student and teacher in which the student earns rewards by meeting a minimum expectation. At the end of class both the student and teacher initial the points earned. At the end of the month, the student may earn a reward of his or her choice provided by the teacher.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== Autism spectrum disorder ===
Various strategies exist to allow students with autism to be successfully included in a physical education setting.

Preparing for inclusion: It is essential to know the students needs, abilities, and preferences. It is also important to prepare the student. The physical education environment may be anxiety inducing for them. Because of this, educators can slowly introduce the student to the environment. They may also preview the class using visual organizers to describe the setting the student will be a part of. They may also make visual schedules prior to class. It is also important to prepare the peers by teaching them what autism is and behaviors associated with it.

Instructing the student: There are a variety of methods for instructing students with autism. The first, environmental prompts. This involves the intentional use of equipment to encourage specific behaviors. The next is verbal prompts. This includes avoiding negative sentences. For example, instruction such as "step with your right leg" as opposed to "don't step with your left leg". Verbal prompts also include keeping phrases literal as well as provided concise instruction. It is also important to be consistent with language use. Peer tutors may also provide a lot of benefits for students in the physical education setting.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== Deafness ===
Being deaf or hard of hearing typically has little impact on the development of motor skills, fitness levels, and participation in sports. However, it is still important to accommodate students who are deaf or hard of hearing in the physical education setting.

Communicate using his or her preferred means of communication. When giving verbal instructions, make sure the student can see the instructors face clearly. Make sure you speak clearly and at a normal rate. Incorporate visual aids that have images or descriptive words. Repeat comments or questions made by the student's classmates. This helps all students alike. Check for understanding by asking students to repeat directions or demonstrate a skill. If an interpreter is involved, make sure to speak directly to the student, rather than the interpreter.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

=== Visual impairments ===
Children with visual impairments can play all of the same sports as their sighted peers, with some modifications. This may include a beeping ball or allowing blind player to walk around and feel the environment before they begin. Modifications can be made continuously until the best solution is found. Children with visual impairments and blindness may need more instruction and practice time to learn new concepts and movements. It is suggested that students receive pre-teaching before the start of a new unit. This can be done before school, after school, during orientation, or at home. Peer tutors may also be effective for students with visual impairments or blindness.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10477">[[Image:Celsus-Bibliothek2.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesus]] ([[Turkey]]), anastylosis carried out 1970–1978]]
'''Anastylosis''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|αναστήλωσις, -εως}}; {{lang|grc|ανα}}, {{lang|grc-Latn|ana}} = "again", and {{lang|grc|στηλόω}}&lt;!-- or styloo--&gt; = "to erect [a stela &lt;!-- or stylos--&gt; or building]") is an [[archaeological]] term for a reconstruction technique whereby a ruined building or monument is restored using the original architectural elements to the greatest degree possible. It is also sometimes used to refer to a similar technique for restoring broken pottery and other small objects.

== Methodology ==
The intent of anastylosis is to rebuild, from as much of the original materials that is left after usually thousands of years of abuse, historical architectural monuments which have fallen into ruin. This is done by placing components back into their original positions. Where standing buildings are at risk of collapse, the method may entail the preparation of drawings and measurements, piece-by-piece disassembly, and careful reassembly, with new materials as required for structural integrity; occasionally this may include new foundations. When elements or parts are missing, modern materials (of restoration grade) may be substituted, such as [[plaster]], [[cement]], and synthetic [[resin]]s.

The international [[Venice Charter]] of 1964 details criteria for anastylosis. First, the original condition of the structure must be confirmed scientifically. Second, the proper placement of each recovered component must be determined. Third, supplemental components must be limited to those necessary for stability (that is, substitute components may never lie at the top), and must be recognizable as replacement materials. New construction for the sake of filling in apparent lacunae is not allowed.

== Criticism ==
Anastylosis has its detractors in the scientific community. In effect, the method poses several problems:
* No matter how rigorous preparatory studies are, any errors of interpretation will result in errors, often undetectable or incorrigible, in reconstruction.
* Damage to the original components is practically inevitable.
* An element may be, or may have been reused in, or may have originated in, different buildings or monuments from different periods. To use it in one reconstruction obviates its use in others.

== Examples ==
===Greece===
[[File:Anastylose Evans Cnossos 1.jpg|thumb|200px|Anastylosis in [[Knossos]] palace, Crete, Greece, by [[Arthur Evans]]]]
A primitive anastylosis was carried out in 1836 at the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]] in [[Athens]], where the [[Temple of Athena Nike]] was re-erected from remaining parts. Starting in 1902, the Greek architect Nikolas Balanos used anastylosis in order to restore a collapsed portion of the [[Parthenon]], restore the [[Erechtheion]], and rebuild the Nike Temple a second time. Iron clamps and plugs which had been used earlier had started to rust and had caused heavy damage to the original structure. These were removed and replaced with precious metal clamps. When the temple was once again rebuilt additional newly identified original fragments were added. Currently, anastylosis is being applied to the Parthenon.

===India===
Several monuments protected by [[Archeological Survey of India]] have been restored, including [[Shekhavati]] [[haveli]]s, [[Humayun's Tomb]], etc.

[[File:The Borobudur in Java, Indonesia.jpg|200px|thumb|One of the earlier examples of anastylosis: the [[Borobudur]] in [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Indonesia]]]]
Early in the 20th century, Dutch archaeologists carried out anastylosis of the [[stupa]] at the [[Buddhist]] temple complex at [[Borobudur]] in Java, [[Indonesia]] between 1907 and 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=zCQlDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA319&amp;lpg=PA319&amp;dq=anastylosis+Borobudur&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=R8cfiLo3gr&amp;sig=QolFH5HIJqWT7cqoPooQ_NlfusM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0ibq46efZAhUMnpQKHYEyAr8Q6AEIWjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=anastylosis%20Borobudur&amp;f=false|title=Architectural Conservation in Asia: National Experiences and Practice|last=Stubbs|first=John H.|last2=Thomson|first2=Robert G.|date=2016-11-10|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781317406198|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prambanan]] Hindu temple complex was excavated and was partially reconstructed between 1911 and 1953, also reconstructed using anastylosis method. The recent practice of anastylosis in Indonesia is the reconstruction of [[Kedulan]] temple, built in 869, the temple was buried under volcanic layers for centuries, until was discovered in 1993. The restoration of the entire Kedulan Temple complex is expected to be completed by the end of 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2018/02/15/kedulan-temple-restoration-enters-anastylosis-phase.html|title=Kedulan Temple restoration enters anastylosis phase|last=Ajie|first=Stefanus|date=17 February 2018|work=The Jakarta Post|access-date=2018-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[École Française d'Extrême-Orient]] (EFEO) began restoration work at [[Angkor Wat]] in 1908. Between 1986 and 1992, the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) carried out restoration work on the temple. [[Bayon]] was restored by EFCO followed by Japanese Government Team for the Safeguarding of Angkor (JSA). [[Ta Prohm]] is being restored by [[Archaeological Survey of India]].

An '''aquatic ecosystem''' is an [[ecosystem]]  in a [[body of water]]. [[Biocoenosis|Communities]] of [[biota (ecology)|organisms]] that are dependent on each other and on their environment live in aquatic ecosystems. The two main types of aquatic ecosystems are [[marine ecosystem]]s and [[freshwater ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Alexander| first = David E.| title = Encyclopedia of Environmental Science| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| date = 1 May 1999| isbn = 0-412-74050-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine ecosystems, the largest of all ecosystems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=University of California Museum of Paleontology: The Marine Biome|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/marine.php?|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; cover approximately 71% of the [[Earth's surface]] and contain approximately 97% of the planet's water.

Approximately 85% of the dissolved materials in [[seawater]] are [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]]. Seawater has an average salinity of 35 [[parts-per notation|parts per thousand]] of water. Actual salinity varies among different marine ecosystems.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web| last = United States Environmental Protection Agency| authorlink = United States Environmental Protection Agency| title = Marine Ecosystems| date = 2 March 2006| url = http://www.epa.gov/bioiweb1/aquatic/marine.html| accessdate = 2006-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:oceanic divisions.svg|thumb|300px|right|A classification of marine habitats.]]
Marine ecosystems can be divided into many zones depending upon water depth and shoreline features. The [[ocean]]ic zone is the vast open part of the ocean where animals such as whales, sharks, and tuna live.  The [[benthic]] zone consists of substrates below water where many invertebrates live. The [[intertidal zone|intertidal]] zone is the area between high and low tides; in this figure it is termed the littoral zone. Other near-shore (neritic) zones can include [[estuary|estuaries]], [[salt marsh]]es, [[coral reef]]s, [[lagoon]]s and [[mangrove]] swamps.  In the deep water, [[hydrothermal vent]]s may occur where [[Chemosynthesis|chemosynthetic]] [[sulfur]] [[bacteria]] form the base of the food web.

[[class (biology)|Classes]] of organisms found in marine ecosystems include [[brown algae]], [[dinoflagellate]]s, [[coral]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, [[echinoderm]]s, and [[shark]]s. Fishes caught in marine ecosystems are the biggest source of commercial foods obtained from wild populations.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

Environmental problems concerning marine ecosystems include unsustainable exploitation of marine resources (for example [[overfishing]] of certain species), [[marine pollution]], [[Fisheries and climate change|climate change]], and building on coastal areas.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

===Freshwater===

{{main|Freshwater ecosystem}}

[[File:Panorama presa las niñas mogan gran canaria.jpg|thumb|640px|left|Freshwater ecosystem.]]{{clear}}
Freshwater ecosystems cover 0.78% of the Earth's surface and inhabit 0.009% of its total water. They generate nearly 3% of its net primary production.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; Freshwater ecosystems contain 41% of the world's known fish species.&lt;ref name=Daily&gt;{{cite book

There are three basic types of freshwater ecosystems:
*[[Lentic system ecology|Lentic]]: slow moving water, including [[pond|pool]]s, [[pond]]s, and [[lake]]s.
*[[Lotic System Ecology|Lotic]]: faster moving water, for example [[stream]]s and [[river]]s.
*[[Wetland]]s: areas where the soil is saturated or inundated for at least part of the time.&lt;ref name=Vaccari&gt;{{cite book

===Lentic ===
{{see also|Lake ecosystem}}

[[File:Primary zones of a lake.png|thumb|400px|right|The three primary zones of a lake.]]
Lake ecosystems can be divided into zones. One common system divides lakes into three zones (see figure).  The first, the [[littoral zone]], is the shallow zone near the shore. This is where rooted wetland plants occur.  The offshore is divided into two further zones, an open water zone and a deep water zone.  In the open water zone (or photic zone) sunlight supports photosynthetic algae, and the species that feed upon them.  In the deep water zone, sunlight is not available and the food web is based on detritus entering from the littoral and photic zones.  Some systems use other names.  The off shore areas may be called the [[pelagic zone]], the [[photic zone]] may be called the [[limnetic zone]] and the [[aphotic zone]] may be called the [[profundal zone]]. Inland from the littoral zone one can also frequently identify a [[riparian zone]] which has plants still affected by the presence of the lake—this can include effects from windfalls, spring flooding, and winter ice damage. The production of the lake as a whole is the result of production from plants growing in the littoral zone, combined with production from plankton growing in the open water.

[[Wetland]]s can be part of the lentic system, as they form naturally along most lake shores, the width of the wetland and littoral zone being dependent upon the slope of the shoreline and the amount of natural change in water levels, within and among years. Often dead trees accumulate in this zone, either from windfalls on the shore or logs transported to the site during floods.  This woody debris provides important habitat for fish and nesting birds, as well as protecting shorelines from erosion.

Two important subclasses of lakes are [[pond]]s, which typically are small lakes that intergrade with wetlands, and water [[reservoir]]s. Over long periods of time, lakes, or bays within them, may gradually become enriched by nutrients and slowly fill in with organic sediments, a process called succession. When humans use the watershed, the volumes of sediment entering the lake can accelerate this process. The addition of sediments and nutrients to a lake is known as [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

====Ponds====

Ponds are small bodies of freshwater with shallow and still water, [[marsh]], and [[aquatic plants]].&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, J. (1986). Observer's Book of Pond Life. Frederick Warne, London. 460 p.&lt;/ref&gt; They can be further divided into four zones: vegetation zone, open water, bottom mud and surface film.&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, J. (1986). Observer's Book of Pond Life. Frederick Warne, London. 460 p. p.160-163.&lt;/ref&gt; The size and depth of ponds often varies greatly with the time of year; many ponds are produced by spring flooding from rivers. [[Food web]]s are based both on free-floating [[algae]] and upon aquatic plants. There is usually a diverse array of aquatic life, with a few examples including algae, snails, fish, beetles, water bugs, frogs, turtles, otters and muskrats. Top predators may include large fish, herons, or alligators.  Since fish are a major predator upon amphibian larvae, ponds that dry up each year, thereby killing resident fish, provide important refugia for amphibian breeding.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; Ponds that dry up completely each year are often known as [[vernal pools]]. Some ponds are produced by animal activity, including alligator holes and beaver ponds, and these add important diversity to landscapes.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;

===Lotic ===
{{see also|River ecosystem}}

The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of [[Oxygen saturation|dissolved oxygen]], which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into [[upland and lowland (freshwater ecology)|upland and lowland]] rivers.  The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] derive the majority of their food base from algae. [[Fish migration|Anadromous fish]] are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and [[introduced species]].&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed.  The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.&lt;ref name= Keddy/&gt;

===Wetlands ===
Wetlands are dominated by [[vascular plant]]s that have adapted to saturated soil.&lt;ref name=Keddy&gt;{{cite book|last=Keddy|first=Paul A.|title=Wetland Ecology. Principles and Conservation.|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51940-3|page=497}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main types of wetlands: swamp, marsh, fen and bog (both fens and bogs are types of [[mire]]). Wetlands are the most productive natural ecosystems in the world because of the proximity of water and soil. Hence they support large numbers of plant and animal species. Due to their productivity, wetlands are often converted into dry land with [[ditch|dykes]] and [[drainage|drains]] and used for agricultural purposes. The construction of dykes, and dams, has negative consequences for individual wetlands and entire watersheds.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; Their closeness to lakes and rivers means that they are often developed for human settlement.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; Once settlements are constructed and protected by dykes, the settlements then become vulnerable to land subsidence and ever increasing risk of flooding.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;  The Louisiana coast around New Orleans is a well-known example;&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P.A., D. Campbell, T. McFalls, G. Shaffer, R. Moreau, C. Dranguet, and R. Heleniak.  2007. The wetlands of lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas: past, present and future.  Environmental Reviews 15: 1- 35.&lt;/ref&gt; the Danube Delta in Europe is another.&lt;ref&gt;Gastescu, P. (1993). The Danube Delta: geographical characteristics and ecological recovery. Earth and Environmental Science, 29, 57–67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions==
Aquatic ecosystems perform many important environmental functions. For example, they [[biogeochemical cycle|recycle nutrients]], purify water, attenuate floods, recharge ground water and provide habitats for wildlife.&lt;ref name=Loeb&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Loeb
  | first = Stanford L.
  | title = Biological Monitoring of Aquatic Systems
  | publisher = [[CRC Press]]
  | date = 24 January 1994
  | isbn = 0-87371-910-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aquatic ecosystems are also used for human recreation, and are very important to the [[tourism]] industry, especially in coastal regions.&lt;ref name=Daily/&gt;

The health of an aquatic ecosystem is degraded when the ecosystem's ability to absorb a stress has been exceeded. A stress on an aquatic ecosystem can be a result of physical, chemical or biological alterations of the environment. Physical alterations include changes in water temperature, water flow and light availability. Chemical alterations include changes in the loading rates of biostimulatory nutrients, oxygen consuming materials, and toxins. Biological alterations include over-harvesting of commercial species and the introduction of exotic species. Human populations can impose excessive stresses on aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Loeb/&gt; There are many examples of excessive stresses with negative consequences. Consider three. The environmental history of the Great Lakes of North America illustrates this problem, particularly how multiple stresses, such as water pollution, over-harvesting and invasive species can combine.&lt;ref name="Vallentyne, J. R. 1974"&gt;Vallentyne, J. R. (1974). The Algal Bowl: Lakes and Man, Miscellaneous Special Publication No. 22. Ottawa, ON: Department of the Environment, Fisheries and Marine Service.&lt;/ref&gt; The Norfolk Broadlands in England illustrate similar decline with pollution and invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;Moss, B. (1983). The Norfolk Broadland: experiments in the restoration of a complex wetland. Biological Reviews of the Cambridge Philosophical Society, 58, 521–561.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lake Pontchartrain along the Gulf of Mexico illustrates the negative effects of different stresses including levee construction, logging of swamps, invasive species and salt water intrusion.&lt;ref&gt;Keddy, P. A., Campbell, D., McFalls T., Shaffer, G., Moreau, R., Dranguet, C., and Heleniak, R. (2007). The wetlands of lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas: past, present and future. Environmental Reviews, 15, 1–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abiotic characteristics==
An ecosystem is composed of [[Biotic component|biotic]] communities that are structured by biological interactions and [[abiotic]] environmental factors. Some of the important abiotic environmental factors of aquatic ecosystems include substrate type, water depth, nutrient levels, temperature, salinity, and flow.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Loeb/&gt; It is often difficult to determine the relative importance of these factors without rather large experiments.  There may be complicated feedback loops.  For example, sediment may determine the presence of aquatic plants, but aquatic plants may also trap sediment, and add to the sediment through peat.

The amount of dissolved oxygen in a water body is frequently the key substance in determining the extent and kinds of organic life in the water body. Fish need dissolved oxygen to survive, although their tolerance to low oxygen varies among species; in extreme cases of low oxygen some fish even resort to air gulping.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, J. B. (1997). Air Breathing Fishes. San Diego, CA: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Plants often have to produce [[aerenchyma]], while the shape and size of leaves may also be altered.&lt;ref&gt;Sculthorpe, C. D. (1967). The Biology of Aquatic Vascular Plants. Reprinted 1985 Edward Arnold, by London.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, oxygen is fatal to many kinds of [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] bacteria.&lt;ref name=Manahan&gt;{{cite book| last = Manahan| first = Stanley E.| title = Environmental Chemistry| publisher = [[CRC Press]]| date = 1 January 2005| isbn = 1-56670-633-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nutrient levels are important in controlling the abundance of many species of algae.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, V. H. (1982). The nitrogen and phosphorus dependence of algal biomass in lakes: an empirical and theoretical analysis. Limnology and Oceanography, 27, 1101–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  The relative abundance of nitrogen and phosphorus can in effect determine which species of algae come to dominate.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, V. H. (1983). Low nitrogen to phosphorus ratios favor dominance by bluegreen algae in lake phytoplankton. Science, 221, 669–71.&lt;/ref&gt; Algae are a very important source of food for aquatic life, but at the same time, if they become over-abundant, they can cause declines in fish when they decay.&lt;ref name="Vallentyne, J. R. 1974"/&gt; Similar over-abundance of algae in coastal environments such as the Gulf of Mexico produces, upon decay, a hypoxic region of water known as a [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]].&lt;ref&gt;Turner, R. E. and Rabelais, N. N. (2003). Linking landscape and water quality in the Mississippi River Basin for 200 years. BioScience, 53, 563–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The salinity of the water body is also a determining factor in the kinds of species found in the water body. Organisms in marine ecosystems tolerate salinity, while many freshwater organisms are intolerant of salt. The degree of salinity in an estuary or delta is an important control upon the type of [[wetland]] (fresh, intermediate, or brackish), and the associated animal species.  Dams built upstream may reduce spring flooding, and reduce sediment accretion, and may therefore lead to saltwater intrusion in coastal wetlands.&lt;ref name = Keddy/&gt;

Freshwater used for [[irrigation]] purposes often absorbs levels of salt that are harmful to freshwater organisms.&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt;

==Biotic characteristics==
The biotic characteristics are mainly determined by the organisms that occur.  For example, wetland plants may produce dense canopies that cover large areas of sediment—or snails or geese may graze the vegetation leaving large mud flats. Aquatic environments have relatively low oxygen levels, forcing adaptation by the organisms found there.  For example, many wetland plants must produce [[aerenchyma]] to carry oxygen to roots. Other biotic characteristics are more subtle and difficult to measure, such as the relative importance of competition, mutualism or predation.&lt;ref name=Keddy/&gt; There are a growing number of cases where predation by coastal herbivores including snails, geese and mammals appears to be a dominant biotic factor.&lt;ref&gt;Silliman, B. R., Grosholz, E. D., and Bertness, M. D. (eds.) (2009). Human Impacts on Salt Marshes: A Global Perspective. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autotrophic organisms===
[[Autotroph]]ic organisms are producers that generate organic compounds from inorganic material. Algae use solar energy to generate biomass from carbon dioxide and are possibly the most important autotrophic organisms in aquatic environments.&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt; The more shallow the water, the greater the biomass contribution from rooted and floating vascular plants. These two sources combine to produce the extraordinary production of estuaries and wetlands, as this autotrophic biomass is converted into fish, birds, amphibians and other aquatic species.

Chemosynthetic bacteria are found in benthic marine ecosystems. These organisms are able to feed on [[hydrogen sulfide]] in water that comes from [[volcanic vent]]s. Great concentrations of animals that feed on these bacteria are found around volcanic vents. For example, there are [[giant tube worm]]s (''Riftia pachyptila'') 1.5&amp;nbsp;m in length and clams (''[[Calyptogena magnifica]]'') 30&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;{{cite book| last = Chapman| first = J.L.|author2=Reiss, M.J.| title = Ecology| publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]| date = 10 December 1998| isbn = 0-521-58802-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heterotrophic organisms===
[[Heterotrophic]] organisms consume autotrophic organisms and use the organic compounds in their bodies as energy sources and as raw materials to create their own [[biomass]].&lt;ref name=Manahan/&gt; [[Euryhaline]] organisms are salt tolerant and can survive in marine ecosystems, while [[stenohaline]] or salt intolerant species can only live in freshwater environments.&lt;ref name=USEPA/&gt;

==History==
In 1977, recording engineer [[Steve Remote]] partnered with Joel Schreiber to create Aura-Sonic, Ltd. Remote had been recording professionally at [[Max's Kansas City]]&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Toby. On The Road With Steve Remote. Home &amp; Studio Recording, 1990, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; since 1976 while Schreiber, a graduate from the American Academy of the Dramatic Arts, was managing a children’s clothing store in [[Flushing, Queens]]. Not content with operating a conventional recording studio, Steve decided to create a studio on wheels so they could go the client instead of the client going to them.&lt;ref name="dB Magazine"/&gt; From 1977 to 1983, Schreiber was the President of ASL with Remote acting as the Vice President and chief engineer. In 1983, Remote bought out Schreiber’s stake in the company and became the sole owner.

{{Inca civilization}}
The '''''ayllu''''' is the traditional form of a [[community]] in the [[Andes]], especially among [[Quechuas]] and [[Aymaras]]. They are an indigenous local government model across the [[Andes]] region of [[South America]], particularly in [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]]. Ayllus functioned [[Pre-Inca cultures|prior to Inca conquest]], during the [[Tawantinsuyu|Inca]] and Spanish colonial period, and continue to exist to the present day.&lt;ref name=PolAnth /&gt; How the ancient form and current organization correspond is unclear, since Spanish chronicles do not give a precise definition of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon F. McEwan, "Ayllu" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 1, p. 248. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayllus had defined territories and were essentially extended family or kin groups, but they could include non-related members, giving individual families more variation and security of the land that they farmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Beck | first = Roger B. | authorlink = |author2=Linda Black |author3=Larry S.

They would often have their own ''[[huaca|wak'a]]'', or minor god, usually embodied in a physical object such as a mountain or rock. "Ayullus were named for a particular person or place."&lt;ref&gt;McEwan, "Ayllu", p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayllu were self-sustaining units and would educate their own offspring and farm or trade for all the food they ate, except in cases of disaster such as [[El Niño]] years when they relied on the Inca storehouse system.&lt;ref name="isbn=0-8094-9870-7"&gt;{{cite book |title=Incas: lords of gold and glory |publisher=Time-Life Books |location=New York |year=1992 |page=64 |isbn=0-8094-9870-7 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their primary function was to solve subsistence issues, and issues of how to get along in family, and larger, units.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8047-1339-1"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Earle, Timothy K. |author2=Johnson, Allen W. |title=The evolution of human societies: from foraging group to agrarian state |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford, Calif |year=1987 |page=263 |isbn=0-8047-1339-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ayllu owned a parcel of land, and the members had reciprocal obligations to each other.&lt;ref name="isbn0-521-31896-3"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Demarest, Arthur Andrew |author2=Conrad, Geoffrey W. |title=Religion and empire: the dynamics of Aztec and Inca expansionism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1984 |page=97 |isbn=0-521-31896-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[marriage]]s, the woman would generally join the class and ayllu of her partner as would her children, but would [[inheritance|inherit]] her land from her parents and retain her membership in her birth ayllu. This is how most movements of people between ayllu occurred. But a person could also join an ayllu by assuming the responsibility of membership. This included ''[[communal work|mink'a]]'', communal work for common purposes, ''[[ayni]]'', or work in kind for other members of the ayllu, and ''[[mit'a]],'' a form of taxation levied by the Inca government.&lt;ref name="isbn=0-8094-9870-7"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Ayllu solidarity is a combination of kinship and territorial ties, as well as symbolism. (Albo 1972; Duviols 1974; Tshopik 1951; and Urioste 1975). These studies, however, do  not explain how the ayllu is a corporate whole, which includes social principles, verticality, and metaphor... Ayllu also refers to people who live in the same territory (''llahta'') and who feed the earth shrines of that territory.”&lt;ref name="Bastien"&gt;Bastien, Joseph. ''Mountain of the Condor: Metaphor and Ritual in an Andean Ayllu''. 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Ayllu'' is a word in both the [[Quechua language|Quechua]] and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] languages referring to a network of families in a given area, often with a putative or [[fictive kinship|fictive]] common ancestor.&lt;ref name=PolAnth&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = ABC-CLIO | isbn = 978-0-89789-891-1 | last = Lewellen | first = Ted C. | title = Political anthropology: An introduction | year = 2003 |pages = 38–39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayllus are distinguished by comparative [[self-sufficiency]], commonly held territory, and relations of reciprocity.&lt;ref name=PolAnth /&gt; Members engage in shared collective labor ({{lang-qu|minga}}) and in [[Mutual aid (organization theory)|reciprocal exchanges of assistance]] ({{lang-qu|[[ayni]]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Infobase Publishing | isbn = 978-0-7910-8095-5 | last = Bahr | first = Ann Marie B. |author2=Martin E.

In Bolivia, representatives from the ayllus are sent to the [[National Council of Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu]] (Conamaq). This body chooses an [[Apu Mallku]] as its head.

'''Bertrand Westphal''' is a French scholar and essayist born on May 10, 1962 in [[Strasbourg, France]].

==Career==
Westphal, a professor of [[comparative literature]] and [[literary theory]], has been teaching at the [[University of Limoges]] since 1998. He has been directing the « Human Spaces and Cultural Interactions » research team (EA 1087) since 2000.

He was a visiting professor at [[Texas Tech University]] (2005) and at the [[University of North Carolina Charlotte]] (2013-2015).

Westphal is the founder of [[Geocriticism]], a method of literary analysis and literary theory that incorporates the study of geographic space. After editing the first collective work on this topic (''La Géocritique mode d'emploi''), he published the essay ''La Géocritique. Réel, fiction, espace'' in 2007. In 2011, the book was translated into English (United States) under the title of ''Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces'' by [[Robert Tally]], who has become one of the main promoters of this literary approach in the United States. Geocriticism lays the foundations of the homonymous theory, i.e. an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses on spatial representations.

In 2011, Westphal published the essay ''Le Monde plausible. Espace, lieu, carte'', which proposes a diachronic study of the models of spatial representation. In this book, he distinguishes open space and closed place and gives special value to maps. In 2013, ''Le Monde plausible'' was translated into English (United States) by Amy Wells under the title ''The Plausible World''.
A third volume, ''La Cage des méridiens. La littérature et l’art contemporain face à la globalisation'', published in March 2016, completes what appears to be a Geocriticism trilogy. This work examines the specific role of literature and contemporary art on a global scale and focuses on transcultural logics and decentering.

Westphal is the author of several other books, such as ''Roman et Evangile'' (2000) about the transposition, in a plain narratological sense, of episodes or characters drawn from the Gospels in the contemporary European novel. He is also the author of ''L’œil de la Méditerranée. Une odyssée littéraire'' (2005), which brings together a series of studies of Mediterranean places, and ''Austro-fictions. Une géographie de l’intime'' (2010), which explores the works of a dozen of contemporary Austrian writers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="169104">In [[biology]], '''developmental bioelectricity''' refers to the [[Regulation of gene expression|regulation]] of [[Cell (biology)|cell]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], and organ-level patterning and behavior as the result of endogenous electrically-mediated signaling. Cells and tissues of all types use ion fluxes to communicate electrically. The charge carrier in bioelectricity is the [[ion]] (charged atom), and an electric current and field is generated whenever a net ion flux occur. Endogenous [[electric current]]s and [[Electric field|fields]], ion fluxes, and differences in resting potential across tissues comprise an ancient and highly conserved communicating and signaling system. It functions alongside (in series and in parallel to) biochemical factors, [[Transcription (biology)|transcriptional]] networks, and other physical forces to regulate the cell behavior and large-scale patterning during [[embryogenesis]], [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]], [[cancer]], and many other processes.

==Contextualization of the field==

Developmental bioelectricity is a sub-discipline of biology, related to, but distinct from, [[neurophysiology]] and [[bioelectromagnetics]]. Developmental bioelectricity refers to the endogenous ion fluxes, transmembrane and transepithelial voltage gradients, and electric currents and fields produced and sustained in living cells and tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=25425556 |pmc=4244194 |year=2014 |author1=Levin |first1=M |title=Molecular bioelectricity: How endogenous voltage potentials control cell behavior and instruct pattern regulation in vivo |journal=Molecular Biology of the Cell |volume=25 |issue=24 |pages=3835–50 |doi=10.1091/mbc.E13-12-0708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid26566112&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-cellbio-100814-125338 |pmid=26566112 |title=Ion Channels in Development and Cancer |journal=Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology |volume=31 |pages=231–47 |year=2015 |last1=Bates |first1=Emily }}&lt;/ref&gt; This electrical activity is often used during embryogenesis, regeneration, and cancer - it is one layer of the complex field of signals that impinge upon all cells ''in vivo'' and regulate their interactions during pattern formation and maintenance (Figure 1). This is distinct from neural bioelectricity (classically termed electrophysiology), which refers to the rapid and transient spiking in well-recognized excitable cells like [[neuron]]s and [[myocyte]]s;&lt;ref name=pmid24773017&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev-biophys-051013-022717 |pmid=24773017 |title=Bringing Bioelectricity to Light |journal=Annual Review of Biophysics |volume=43 |pages=211–32 |year=2014 |last1=Cohen |first1=Adam E |last2=Venkatachalam |first2=Veena }}&lt;/ref&gt; and from bioelectromagnetics, which refers to the effects of applied electromagnetic radiation, and endogenous electromagnetics such as [[biophoton]] emission and magnetite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19167986 |year=2009 |author1=Funk |first1=R.

==Overview of the field: terminology and basic definitions==

The inside/outside discontinuity at the cell surface enabled by a [[lipid bilayer]] membrane (capacitor) is at the core of bioelectricity. The plasma membrane was an indispensable structure for the origin and evolution of life itself. It provided compartmentalization permitting the setting of a differential voltage/potential gradient (battery or voltage source) across the [[membrane]], probably allowing early and rudimentary bioenergetics that fueled cell mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20108228 |year=2010 |author1=Lane |first1=N |title=How did LUCA make a living? Chemiosmosis in the origin of life |journal=BioEssays |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=271–80 |last2=Allen |first2=J. F |last3=Martin |first3=W |doi=10.1002/bies.200900131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23260134 |year=2012 |author1=Lane |first1=N |title=The origin of membrane bioenergetics |journal=Cell |volume=151 |issue=7 |pages=1406–16 |last2=Martin |first2=W. F |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2012.11.050 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During evolution, the initially purely passive diffusion of ions (charge carriers), become gradually controlled by the acquisition of [[ion channel]]s, [[Ion transporter|pumps]], exchangers, and transporters. These energetically free (resistors or conductors, passive transport) or expensive (current sources, active transport) translocators set and fine tune voltage gradients – resting potentials – that are ubiquitous and essential to life's physiology, ranging from bioenergetics, motion, sensing, nutrient transport, toxins clearance, and signaling in homeostatic and disease/injury conditions. Upon stimuli or barrier breaking (short-circuit) of the membrane, ions powered by the voltage gradient (electromotive force) diffuse or leak, respectively, through the [[cytoplasm]] and [[Extracellular fluid|interstitial fluids]] (conductors), generating measurable electric currents – net ion fluxes – and fields. Some ions (such as [[calcium]]) and molecules (such as [[hydrogen peroxide]]) modulate targeted translocators to produce a current or to enhance, mitigate or even reverse an initial current, being switchers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24801267 |year=2014 |author1=Luxardi |first1=G |title=Single cell wound generates electric current circuit and cell membrane potential variations that requires calcium influx |journal=Integr.

Endogenous bioelectric signals are produced in cells by the cumulative action of ion channels, pumps, and transporters. In non-excitable cells, the resting potential across the plasma membrane (Vmem) of individual cells propagate across distances via electrical synapses known as gap junctions (conductors), which allow cells to share their resting potential with neighbors. Aligned and stacked cells (such as in epithelia) generate transepithelial potentials (battery in series) and electric fields (Figures 2 and 3), which likewise propagate across tissues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robinson |first1=K. |last2=Messerli |first2=M. |chapter=Electric Embryos: the embryonic epithelium as a generator of development information |editor1-last=McCaig |editor1-first=C |title=Nerve growth and guidance |pages=131–41 |publisher=Portland |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tight junctions (resistors) efficiently mitigate the paracellular ion diffusion and leakage, precluding the voltage short-circuit. Together, these voltages and electric fields form rich and dynamic and patterns (Figure 5) inside living bodies that demarcate [[Morphology (biology)|anatomical features]], thus acting like blueprints for [[gene expression]] and morphogenesis in some instances. More than correlations, these bioelectrical distributions are dynamic, evolving with time and with the microenvironment and even long-distant conditions to serve as instructive influences over cell behavior and large-scale patterning during embryogenesis, regeneration, and cancer suppression.&lt;ref name=pmid26566112/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=29291972 |pmc=5753428 |year=2018 |author1=McLaughlin |first1=K.

==Brief history of the field: the pioneers in bioelectricity==

The modern roots of developmental bioelectricity can be traced back to the entire 18th century. Several seminal works stimulating muscle contractions using [[Leyden jar]]s culminated with the publication of classical studies by [[Luigi Galvani]] in 1791 (De viribus electricitatis in motu musculari) and 1794. In these, Galvani thought to have uncovered intrinsic electric-producing ability in living tissues or “animal electricity”. [[Alessandro Volta|Allessandro Volta]] showed that the frog's leg muscle twitching was due to a static electricity generator and from dissimilar [[metal]]s contact. Galvani showed, in a 1794 study, twitching without metal electricity by touching the leg muscle with a deviating cut [[sciatic nerve]], definitively showing “animal electricity”. Unknowingly, Galvani with this and related experiments discovered the injury current (ion leakage driven by the intact membrane/epithelial potential) and injury potential (potential difference between injured and intact membrane/epithelium). The injury potential was, in fact, the electrical source behind the leg contraction, as realized in the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Maden, M. A history of regeneration research.

Building on earlier studies, further glimpses of developmental bioelectricity occurred with the discovery of wound-related electric currents and fields in the 1860s, when one of the founding fathers of modern [[electrophysiology]] – [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] – reported macroscopic level electrical activities in frog, fish and human bodies. He recorded minute electric currents in live tissues and organisms with a then state-of-the-art [[galvanometer]] made of insulated copper wire coils. He unveiled the fast-changing electricity associated with muscle contraction and nerve excitation – the action potentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01640316 |title=Ueber den zeitlichen Verlauf der negativen Schwankung des Nervenstroms |trans-title=About the time course of the negative fluctuation of the nerve current |language=de |journal=Pflüger, Archiv für die Gesammte Physiologie des Menschen und der Thiere |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=173–207 |year=1868 |last1=Bernstein |first1=J }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/andp.18481511120 |title=Untersuchungen über thierische Elektricität |trans-title=Investigations on animal electricity |language=de |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume=151 |issue=11 |pages=463–4 |year=1848 |last1=Du Bois-Reymond |first1=Emil }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0166-2236(83)90078-4 |title=The discovery of the action potential |journal=Trends in Neurosciences |volume=6 |pages=164–8 |year=1983 |last1=Schuetze |first1=Stephen M }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, du Bois-Reymond also reported in detail less fluctuating electricity at wounds – injury current and potential – he made to himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Du Bois-Reymond |first1=Emil |title=Untersuchungen uber thierische Elektricitat |trans-title=Investigations on Animal Electricity |language=de |location=Berlin |publisher=Georg Reimer |year=1860 }}{{page needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this body of work generated a significant amount of high-quality physiological data, this large-scale biophysics approach has historically been in the shadow of the limelight of biochemical gradients and genetic networks in biology education, funding, and overall popularity among biologists. A key factor that contributed to this field lagging behind molecular genetics and biochemistry is that bioelectricity is inherently a living phenomenon – it cannot be studied in fixed specimens. Working with bioelectricity is more complex than traditional approaches to developmental biology, both methodologically and conceptually, as it typically requires a highly interdisciplinary approach.&lt;ref name=pmid28633567/&gt;

==Methodology for studying bioelectric signaling: electrode-based techniques==

Also, the microelectrode vibrates at low frequencies to operate in the accurate self-referencing mode. Only the specific ion permeates the [[ionophore]], therefore the voltage readout is proportional to the ion concentration in the measuring condition.

Compared with the electrode-based techniques, the molecular probes provide a wider spatial resolution and facilitated dynamic analysis over time. Although calibration or titration can be possible, molecular probes are typically semi-quantitative, whereas electrodes provide absolute bioelectric values. Another advantage of [[fluorescence]] and other probes is their less-invasive nature and spatial multiplexing, enabling the simultaneous monitoring of large areas of embryonic or other tissues ''in vivo'' during normal or pathological pattering processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1113/expphysiol.2010.053942 |pmid=20851856 |title=Optogenetic monitoring of membrane potentials |journal=Experimental Physiology |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=13–8 |year=2011 |last1=Mutoh |first1=Hiroki |last2=Perron |first2=Amélie |last3=Akemann |first3=Walther |last4=Iwamoto |first4=Yuka |last5=Knöpfel |first5=Thomas }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human disorders, as well as numerous mouse mutants show that bioelectric signaling is important for human development (Tables 1 and 2). Those effects are pervasively linked to channelopathies, which are human disorders that result from mutations that disrupt ion channels.

==Role in wound healing and cell guidance==

One of the best-understood roles for bioelectric gradients is at the tissue-level endogenous electric fields utilized during wound healing. It is challenging to study wound-associated electric fields, because these fields are weak, less fluctuating, and do not have immediate biological responses when compared to nerve pulses and muscle contraction. The development of the vibrating  and glass microelectrodes, demonstrated that wounds indeed produced and, importantly, sustained measurable electric currents and electric fields.&lt;ref name=pmid4421919/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid7065232&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.1982.242.3.R358 |pmid=7065232 |title=The glabrous epidermis of cavies contains a powerful battery |journal=American Journal of Physiology.

How are the electric fields at a wound produced? Epithelia actively pump and differentially segregate ions. In the cornea epithelium, for example, Na+ and K+ are transported inwards from tear fluid to extracellular fluid, and Cl− is transported out of the extracellular fluid into the tear fluid. The epithelial cells are connected by tight junctions, forming the major electrical resistive barrier, and thus establishing an electrical gradient across the epithelium – the transepithelial potential (TEP).&lt;ref&gt;Maurice, D. M. The permeability to sodium ions of the living rabbit's cornea. J Physiol 112, 367-391. Pubmed Central reference number: PMC1393020&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klyce, S. D. Electrical profiles in the corneal epithelium. J Physiol 226, 407-429. Pubmed Central reference number: PMC1331188&lt;/ref&gt; Breaking the epithelial barrier, as occurs in any wounds, creates a hole that breaches the high electrical resistance established by the tight junctions in the epithelial sheet, short-circuiting the epithelium locally. The TEP therefore drops to zero at the wound. However, normal ion transport continues in unwounded epithelial cells beyond the wound edge (typically &lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm away), driving positive charge flow out of the wound and establishing a steady, laterally-oriented electric field (EF) with the cathode at the wound. Skin also generates a TEP, and when a skin wound is made, similar wound electric currents and fields arise, until the epithelial barrier function recovers to terminate the short-circuit at the wound. When wound electric fields are manipulated with pharmacological agents that either stimulate or inhibit transport of ions, the wound electric fields also increase or decrease, respectively. Wound healing can be speed up or slowed down accordingly in cornea wounds.&lt;ref name=pmid15746181/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid16871217/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/jcs.01341 |pmid=15371524 |title=Nerve regeneration and wound healing are stimulated and directed by an endogenous electrical field in vivo |journal=Journal of Cell Science |volume=117 |issue=20 |pages=4681–90 |year=2004 |last1=Song |first1=B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

How do electric fields affect wound healing? To heal wounds, cells surrounding the wound must migrate and grow directionally into the wound to cover the defect and restore the barrier. Cells important to heal wounds respond remarkably well to applied electric fields of the same strength that are measured at wounds. The whole gamut of cell types and their responses following injury are affected by physiological electric fields. Those include migration and division of epithelial cells, sprouting and extension of nerves, and migration of leukocytes and endothelial cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4049/jimmunol.181.4.2465 |pmid=18684937 |pmc=2572691 |title=Lymphocyte Electrotaxis in Vitro and in Vivo |journal=The Journal of Immunology |volume=181 |issue=4 |pages=2465–71 |year=2008 |last1=Lin |first1=F |last2=Baldessari |first2=F |last3=Gyenge |first3=C.

How cells sense such minute extracellular electric fields remains largely elusive.

==Role in animal regeneration==

In the early 20th century, Albert Mathews seminally correlated regeneration of a cnidarian polyp with the potential difference between polyp and [[stolon]] surfaces, and affected regeneration by imposing countercurrents. Amedeo Herlitzka, following on the wound electric currents footsteps of his mentor, du Bois-Raymond, theorized about electric currents playing an early role in regeneration, maybe initiating cell proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maden |first1=M. |title=A history of regeneration research |publisher=Cambridge University |year=1991 }}{{page needed|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using electric fields overriding endogenous ones, Marsh and Beams astoundingly generated double-headed planarians and even reversed the primary body polarity entirely, with tails growing where a head previously existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jcp.1030390203 |pmid=14946235 |title=Electrical control of morphogenesis in regenerating dugesia tigrina.

Life is ultimately an electrochemical enterprise; research in this field is progressing along several frontiers. First is the reductive program of understanding how bioelectric signals are produced, how voltage changes in the cell membrane are able to regulate cell behavior, and what are the genetic and epigenetic downstream targets of bioelectric signals. A few mechanisms that transduce bioelectric change into alterations of gene expression are already known, including the bioelectric control of movement of small second-messenger molecules through cells, including serotonin and butyrate, voltage sensitive phosphatases, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/ar.22495 |pmid=22933452 |pmc=3442154 |title=Transducing Bioelectric Signals into Epigenetic Pathways During Tadpole Tail Regeneration |journal=The Anatomical Record |volume=295 |issue=10 |pages=1541–51 |year=2012 |last1=Tseng |first1=Ai-Sun |last2=Levin |first2=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2007.04.007 |pmid=17498955 |title=Large-scale biophysics: Ion flows and regeneration |journal=Trends in Cell Biology |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=261–70 |year=2007 |last1=Levin |first1=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also known are numerous gene targets of voltage signaling, such as [[Notch signaling pathway|Notch]], [[BMPR1A|BMP]], [[FGF1|FGF]], and [[Hypoxia-inducible factors|HIF-1α]].&lt;ref name=pmid14786543/&gt; Thus, the proximal mechanisms of bioelectric signaling within single cells are becoming well-understood, and advances in optogenetics&lt;ref name=pmid25896279/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid23519324/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24773017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4190-10.2010 |pmid=21068304 |pmc=2997431 |title=Toward the Second Generation of Optogenetic Tools |journal=Journal of Neuroscience |volume=30 |issue=45 |pages=14998–5004 |year=2010 |last1=Knopfel |first1=T |last2=Lin |first2=M.

Bioelectric modulation has shown control over complex morphogenesis and remodeling, not merely setting individual cell identity. Moreover, a number of the key results in this field have shown that bioelectric circuits are non-local – regions of the body make decisions based on bioelectric events at a considerable distance.&lt;ref name=pmid25762681/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid25646081/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24830454/&gt; Such non-cell-autonomous events suggest distributed network models of bioelectric control;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsif.2016.0555 |pmid=27807271 |pmc=5134011 |title=Top-down models in biology: Explanation and control of complex living systems above the molecular level |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |volume=13 |issue=124 |pages=20160555 |year=2016 |last1=Pezzulo |first1=Giovanni |last2=Levin |first2=Michael }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid26571046&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1039/c5ib00221d |pmid=26571046 |pmc=4667987 |title=Re-membering the body: Applications of computational neuroscience to the top-down control of regeneration of limbs and other complex organs |journal=Integrative Biology |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=1487–517 |year=2015 |last1=Pezzulo |first1=G |last2=Levin |first2=M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rsif.2014.1383 |pmid=25788538 |pmc=4387527 |title=Knowing one's place: A free-energy approach to pattern regulation |journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface |volume=12 |issue=105 |pages=20141383 |year=2015 |last1=Friston |first1=K |last2=Levin |first2=M |last3=Sengupta |first3=B |last4=Pezzulo |first4=G }}&lt;/ref&gt; new computational and conceptual paradigms may need to be developed to understand spatial information processing in bioelectrically-active tissues.

'''BoardVitals''' is a [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialty]] [[board certification]] preparation firm, offering comprehensive study material and question banks for physicians, medical students, and others in the health-care industry. Founded in 2012, it delivers the most current questions to provide users with the best available board review, in a web application. The test questions are peer-reviewed by medical practitioners to guarantee the most relevant preparation for users. The exam provides user feedback on how they compare to their peers overall on a test and how they compared on specific questions. BoardVitals boasts a pass rate among its users as much as ten percent higher than the national average.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web| last =Fisher| first =Nicole| title =Health IT Thrives With New Startup Companies| work =Forbes| date =Oct 2, 2013| url =https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/10/02/health-it-thrives-with-new-startup-companies/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ground&gt;{{cite web| title =BoardVitals.com Launches New Program to Assist with Medical Board Exams | work =ground report| date =Jan 21, 2014| url =http://groundreport.com/boardvitals-com-launches-new-program-to-assist-with-medical-board-exams/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2&gt;{{cite web| title =Tips for Studying and Passing the Medical Board Exams| work =CNN| date =Feb 10, 2014| url =http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1082537}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=med&gt;{{cite web| last =Baum| first =Stephanie| title =Blueprint Health accelerator welcomes fourth class| work =Med City News| date =Jul 12, 2013| url =http://medcitynews.com/2013/07/blueprint-health-welcomes-fourth-accelerator-class/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based in New York City, BoardVitals was the recent winner of the 2014 Gust Catapult NYC venture capital competition for start-ups in the area, providing the firm with further [[venture capital]] and [[angel investing]] opportunities.&lt;ref name=start&gt;{{cite web| last =Gersten| first =Lana| title =Gust Names BoardVitals Winner of Startup Contest CATAPULT NYC| work =Startup Beat| date =Feb 25, 2014| url =http://startupbeat.com/2014/02/25/gust-names-boardvitals-winner-startup-contest-catapult-nyc/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
BoardVitals was founded in 2012 by Dr. Andrea Paul and Dan Lambert. Dr. Paul is a graduate of [[Michigan State]] medical school, and a former resident at [[Yale medical school]] and [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mt. Sinai Hospital]]. She has stated that among her motivations for the company was the disorganization she experienced while studying for medical board exams. In an interview with ''Entrepreneur Magazine'', she remembered when she “was preparing for [her] own boards, [she] was putting together things from other books and notes that were not up to date.”&lt;ref name=entr&gt;{{cite web| last =Maindiratta| first =Nitasha| title =These 3 Startups Are Looking to Get the Health Industry in Tip-Top Shape| work =Entrepreneur | date =Feb 7, 2014| url =http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/231325}}&lt;/ref&gt; She critiqued the lack of any standardized preparation or review and therefore sought to make a dynamic change. Dr. Paul left her Yale residency program to team up with several medical educators.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref name=med/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web| last =Kavilanz| first =Parija| title =I ditched med school to start a business| work =CNN| date =Sep 18, 2013| url =http://money.cnn.com/gallery/smallbusiness/2013/09/18/medical-school-entrepreneurs/2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She partnered with [[Harvard Business School]] graduate and software developer Dan Lambert in 2012 to head Board Vitals as its CEO. Lambert was formerly a co-founder and CTO at Pushpins, which was acquired by Ebates in 2013.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Pushpins| work =Crunchbase| url =https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pushpins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business structure==
After its founding in 2012, BoardVitals has undergone several rounds of financing. In January 2014 it received a $500k seed investment from venture capital firms Rothenberg Ventures and Accelerator Blueprint Health.&lt;ref name=ground/&gt;&lt;ref name=med/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Heussner| first =Ki Mae| title =Got revenue? Blueprint Health accelerator picks its most advanced class yet | work =GIGAOM| date =Jul 12, 2013| url =https://gigaom.com/2013/07/12/got-revenue-blueprint-health-accelerator-picks-its-most-advanced-class-yet/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vent&gt;{{cite web| title =BoardVitals.com Raises Seed Funding| work =VC News Daily| date =Jan 22, 2014| url =http://www.vcnewsdaily.com/boardvitals.com/venture-capital-funding/gmpssyllqn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014, BoardVitals entered the Gust Catapult NYC startup contest sponsored by entrepreneur and investor [[David S. Rose]]. The contest creates a platform for startups to pitch their business plan to a series of angel investors and venture capitalists. BoardVitals was selected as the winner of the competition out of over two hundred candidates. It was then invited to spend three months in a [[Silicon Alley]] incubator under the tutelage of Rose. BoardVitals has drawn the attention of several major investment groups.&lt;ref name=start/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyd&gt;{{cite web| last =Furman| first =Phyllis| title =Just what the doctor ordered: an NYC app that helps physicians study wins top prize in startup contest| work =New York Daily News| date =Feb 20, 2014| url =http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/doctor-ordered-nyc-app-helps-physicians-study-wins-top-prize-startup-contest-article-1.1620939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its clients include [[Harvard medical school]], [[Yale medical school]], and the [[Veterans Health Administration]]. In addition it has partnerships with several medical publishers, including [[McGraw-Hill]], [[Wolters Kluwer Health]], and [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley Publishers]].&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=vent/&gt; The business model focuses on aggregating questions and answers from Publishers, Universities, and individually contributing physicians in a single location.

==Test preparation==
Medical practitioners often continue their education after medical school by completing a residency in a specialty field to become a medical specialist. To complete their certification, the practitioner is required to pass a board certification exam to illustrate mastery of knowledge. Traditionally, there has been no standard review for these tests and study often includes outdated material. In addition, traditional review often requires multiple sources such as textbooks, lecture notes, and journals that can become costly and tedious. In recent years there has been a decline in pass rates among board certifications.&lt;ref name=ground/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref name=entr/&gt;

BoardVitals offers comprehensive test preparation for several specialty fields available on any electronic device. The material is taken from top medical universities, publishers and individually practicing physicians and compiled into a review database that can be accessed anytime from any number of mobile devices. It also only provides the most up-to-date medical knowledge in its curriculum, making sure its users never review obsolete material. Other material is sourced from top medical journals and texts in each specialty.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=ground/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref name=med/&gt;&lt;ref name=entr/&gt;

Questions are written by faculty from top institutions and by several physician contributors. These questions are voted up or down through [[crowdsourcing]] among users to determine which questions more accurately reflect the specific specialty exam. This also ensures that out of date content is removed.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref name=entr/&gt;

Its board review programs are offered to individuals as well as medical schools, residency programs, teaching hospitals, and other medical facilities, both in the United States and abroad. It currently offers test reviews and questions for sixteen specialty fields:
* [[Cardiology]]
* [[Child Psychiatry]]
* [[Dermatology]]
* [[Echocardiography]]
* [[Emergency Medicine]]
* [[Otorhinolaryngology|ENT]]
* [[Family Medicine]]
* [[Gastroenterology]]
* [[Internal Medicine]]
* [[Neurology]]
* [[OBGYN]]
* [[Pathology]]
* [[Pediatrics]]
* [[Psychiatry]]
* [[Radiology]]
* [[Surgery]]&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref name=med/&gt;

Dr. Paul has stated the company plans to expand this to many more fields in the coming years.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

Each exam and question offers users feedback on their performance. It indicates where they stand in comparison to their peers, including data about what other users answered on a particular question. The statistics give users an accurate review of their performance in each section. User can customize practice tests to suit their exact needs, with advanced statistics available to offer premier test review. Board Vitals has given a guarantee that users will pass their board review.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref name=med/&gt;&lt;ref name=entr/&gt;

==Reception==
Dr. Paul was recently named among the top ten disruptive women in healthcare startups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =10 Disruptive Women-Led Life Science Startups Selected for Springboard Enterprises’ 2014 Accelerator Class| work =Disruptive Women | url =http://www.disruptivewomen.net/2014/05/02/10-disruptive-women-led-life-science-startups-selected-for-springboard-enterprises-2014-accelerator-class/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gust.com'' named Board Vitals the 'Most Promising' startup in New York. The company has been featured in business profiles by several newspapers including ''CNN'', ''Forbes'', and ''Fox News''.&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Online Tool Helping Medical Students Prep For Exam| work =Fox News| date =Mar 27, 2014| url =http://foxct.com/2014/03/27/online-tool-helping-medical-students-prep-for-exam/#ixzz2xBFiKVqO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Board Vitals has been used by over 100,000 clinicians for board certification preparation and continuing education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About BoardVitals|url=https://www.boardvitals.com/about|website=BoardVitals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| System || 1.1 || Deploy an automated asset inventory discovery tool and use it to build a preliminary inventory of systems connected to an organization’s public and private network(s). Both active tools that scan through IPv4 or IPv6 network address ranges and passive tools that identify hosts based on analyzing their traffic should be employed.
|-
| System || 1.2 || If the organization is dynamically assigning addresses using DHCP, then deploy dynamic host configuration protocol&amp;nbsp;(DHCP) server logging, and use this information to improve the asset inventory and help detect unknown systems.
|-
| System || 1.3 || Ensure that all equipment acquisitions automatically update the inventory system as new, approved devices are connected to the network.
|-
| System || 1.4 || Maintain an asset inventory of all systems connected to the network and the network devices themselves, recording at least the network addresses, machine name(s), purpose of each system, an asset owner responsible for each device, and the department associated with each device. The inventory should include every system that has an Internet protocol (IP) address on the network, including but not limited to desktops, laptops, servers, network equipment (routers, switches, firewalls, etc.), printers, storage area networks, Voice Over-IP telephones, multi-homed addresses, virtual addresses, etc.  The asset inventory created must also include data on whether the device is a portable and/or personal device. Devices such as mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and other portable electronic devices that store or process data must be identified, regardless of whether they are attached to the organization’s network.
|-
| System || 1.5 || Deploy network level authentication via 802.1x to limit and control which devices can be connected to the network.  The 802.1x must be tied into the inventory data to determine authorized versus unauthorized systems.
|-
| System || 1.6 || Use client certificates to validate and authenticate systems prior to connecting to the private network.
|- id="CSC2"
| colspan="3" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=13 Critical Security Control #2: Inventory of Authorized and Unauthorized Software]'''
|-
| System || 2.1 || Devise a list of authorized software and version that is required in the enterprise for each type of system, including servers, workstations, and laptops of various kinds and uses.  This list should be monitored by file integrity checking tools to validate that the authorized software has not been modified.
|-
| System || 2.2 || Deploy application whitelisting technology that allows systems to run software only if it is included on the whitelist and prevents execution of all other software on the system. The whitelist may be very extensive (as is available from commercial whitelist vendors), so that users are not inconvenienced when using common software. Or, for some special-purpose systems (which require only a small number of programs to achieve their needed business functionality), the whitelist may be quite narrow.
|-
| System || 2.3 || Deploy software inventory tools throughout the organization covering each of the operating system types in use, including servers, workstations, and laptops. The software inventory system should track the version of the underlying operating system as well as the applications installed on it. The software inventory systems must be tied into the hardware asset inventory so all devices and associated software are tracked from a single location.
|-
| System || 2.4 || Virtual machines and/or air-gapped systems should be used to isolate and run applications that are required for business operations but based on higher risk should not be installed within a networked environment. 
|- id="CSC3"
| colspan="3" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=16 Critical Security Control #3: Secure Configurations for Hardware and Software]'''
|-
| System || 3.1 || Establish standard secure configurations of your operating systems and software applications. Standardized images should represent hardened versions of the underlying operating system and the applications installed on the system. These images should be validated and refreshed on a regular basis to update their security configuration in light of recent vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
|-
| System || 3.2 || Follow strict configuration management, building a secure image that is used to build all new systems that are deployed in the enterprise.  Any existing system that becomes compromised should be re-imaged with the secure build. Regular updates or exceptions to this image should be integrated into the organization’s change management processes.  Images should be created for workstations, servers, and other system types used by the organization.
|-
| System || 3.3 || Store the master images on securely configured servers, validated with integrity checking tools capable of continuous inspection, and change management to ensure that only authorized changes to the images are possible. Alternatively, these master images can be stored in offline machines, air-gapped from the production network, with images copied via secure media to move them between the image storage servers and the production network.
|-
| System || 3.4 || Perform all remote administration of servers, workstation, network devices, and similar equipment over secure channels. Protocols such as telnet, VNC, RDP, or others that do not actively support strong encryption should only be used if they are performed over a secondary encryption channel, such as SSL, TLS or IPSEC.
|-
| System || 3.5 || Use file integrity checking tools to ensure that critical system files (including sensitive system and application executables, libraries, and configurations) have not been altered. The reporting system should: have the ability to account for routine and expected changes; highlight and alert on unusual or unexpected alterations; show the history of configuration changes over time and identify who made the change (including the original logged-in account in the event of a user ID switch, such as with the su or sudo command). These integrity checks should identify suspicious system alterations such as: owner and permissions changes to files or directories; the use of alternate data streams which could be used to hide malicious activities; and the introduction of extra files into key system areas (which could indicate malicious payloads left by attackers or additional files inappropriately added during batch distribution processes).
|-
| System || 3.6 || Implement and test an automated configuration monitoring system that verifies all remotely testable secure configuration elements, and alerts when unauthorized changes occur. This includes detecting new listening ports, new administrative users, changes to group and local policy objects (where applicable), and new services running on a system. Whenever possible use tools compliant with the Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) in order to streamline reporting and integration.
|-
| System || 3.7 || Deploy system configuration management tools, such as Active Directory Group Policy Objects for Microsoft Windows systems or Puppet for UNIX systems that will automatically enforce and redeploy configuration settings to systems at regularly scheduled intervals. They should be capable of triggering redeployment of configuration settings on a scheduled, manual, or event-driven basis.
|- id="CSC4"
| colspan="3" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=20 Critical Security Control #4: Continuous Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation]'''
|-
| System || 4.1 || Run automated vulnerability scanning tools against all systems on the network on a weekly or more frequent basis and deliver prioritized lists of the most critical vulnerabilities to each responsible system administrator along with risk scores that compare the effectiveness of system administrators and departments in reducing risk.  Use a SCAP-validated vulnerability scanner that looks for both code-based vulnerabilities (such as those described by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures entries) and configuration-based vulnerabilities (as enumerated by the Common Configuration Enumeration Project).
|-
| System || 4.2 || Correlate event logs with information from vulnerability scans to fulfill two goals. First, personnel should verify that the activity of the regular vulnerability scanning tools  is itself logged. Second, personnel should be able to correlate attack detection events with prior vulnerability scanning results to determine whether the given exploit was used against a target known to be vulnerable.
|-
| System || 4.3 || Perform vulnerability scanning in authenticated mode either with agents running locally on each end system to analyze the security configuration or with remote scanners that are given administrative rights on the system being tested. Use a dedicated account for authenticated vulnerability scans, which should not be used for any other administrative activities and should be tied to specific machines at specific IP addresses.  Ensure that only authorized employees have access to the vulnerability management user interface and that roles are applied to each user.
|-
| System || 4.4 || Subscribe to vulnerability intelligence services in order to stay aware of emerging exposures, and use the information gained from this subscription to update the organization’s vulnerability scanning activities on at least a monthly basis.  Alternatively, ensure that the vulnerability scanning tools you use are regularly updated with all relevant important security vulnerabilities.
|-
| System || 4.5 || Deploy automated patch management tools and software update tools for operating system and software/applications on all systems for which such tools are available and safe.  Patches should be applied to all systems, even systems that are properly air gapped.
|-
| System || 4.6 || Monitor logs associated with any scanning activity and associated administrator accounts to ensure that this activity is limited to the timeframes of legitimate scans.  
|-
| System || 4.7 || Compare the results from back-to-back vulnerability scans to verify that vulnerabilities were addressed either by patching, implementing a compensating control, or documenting and accepting a reasonable business risk. Such acceptance of business risks for existing vulnerabilities should be periodically reviewed to determine if newer compensating controls or subsequent patches can address vulnerabilities that were previously accepted, or if conditions have changed, increasing the risk.
|-
| System || 4.8 || Establish a process to risk-rate vulnerabilities based on the exploitability and potential impact of the vulnerability, and segmented by appropriate groups of assets (example, DMZ servers, internal network servers, desktops, laptops).  Apply patches for the riskiest vulnerabilities first.  A phased rollout can be used to minimize the impact to the organization. Establish expected patching timelines based on the risk rating level. 
|- id="CSC5"
| colspan="3" | '''[https://www.cisecurity.org/critical-controls/documents/CSC-MASTER-VER%206.0%20CIS%20Critical%20Security%20Controls%2010.15.2015.pdf#page=24 Critical Security Control #5: Controlled Use of Administrative Privileges]'''
|-
| System || 5.1 || Minimize administrative privileges and only use administrative accounts when they are required.  Implement focused auditing on the use of administrative privileged functions and monitor for anomalous behavior.
|-
| System || 5.2 || Use automated tools to inventory all administrative accounts and validate that each person with administrative privileges on desktops, laptops, and servers is authorized by a senior executive.
|-
| System || 5.3 || Before deploying any new devices in a networked environment, change all default passwords for applications, operating systems, routers, firewalls, wireless access points, and other systems to have values consistent with administration-level accounts.
|-
| System || 5.4 || Configure systems to issue a log entry and alert when an account is added to or removed from a domain administrators’ group, or when a new local administrator account is added on a system.
|-
| System || 5.5 || Configure systems to issue a log entry and alert on any unsuccessful login to an administrative account.
|-
| System || 5.6 || Use multifactor authentication for all administrative access, including domain administrative access.  Multi-factor authentication can include a variety of techniques, to include the use of smart cards, certificates, One Time Password (OTP) tokens, biometrics, or other similar authentication methods.
|-
| System || 5.7 || Where multi-factor authentication is not supported, user accounts shall be required to use long passwords on the system (longer than 14 characters). 
|-
| System || 5.8 || Administrators should be required to access a system using a fully logged and non-administrative account. Then, once logged on to the machine without administrative privileges, the administrator should transition to administrative privileges using tools such as Sudo on Linux/UNIX, RunAs on Windows, and other similar facilities for other types of systems.

|-
| System || 6.1 || Include at least two synchronized time sources from which all servers and network equipment retrieve time information on a regular basis so that timestamps in logs are consistent.
|-
| System || 6.2 || Validate audit log settings for each hardware device and the software installed on it, ensuring that logs include a date, timestamp, source addresses, destination addresses, and various other useful elements of each packet and/or transaction. Systems should record logs in a standardized format such as syslog entries or those outlined by the Common Event Expression initiative. If systems cannot generate logs in a standardized format, log normalization tools can be deployed to convert logs into such a format.
|-
| System || 6.3 || Ensure that all systems that store logs have adequate storage space for the logs generated on a regular basis, so that log files will not fill up between log rotation intervals.  The logs must be archived and digitally signed on a periodic basis.
|-
| System || 6.4 || Have security personnel and/or system administrators run biweekly reports that identify anomalies in logs. They should then actively review the anomalies, documenting their findings.
|-
| System || 6.5 || Configure network boundary devices, including firewalls, network-based IPS, and inbound and outbound proxies, to verbosely log all traffic (both allowed and blocked) arriving at the device.
|-
| System || 6.6 || Deploy a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) or log analytic tools for log aggregation and consolidation from multiple machines and for log correlation and analysis.  Using the SIEM tool, system administrators and security personnel should devise profiles of common events from given systems so that they can tune detection to focus on unusual activity, avoid false positives, more rapidly identify anomalies, and prevent overwhelming analysts with insignificant alerts.

|-
| System || 7.1 || Ensure that only fully supported web browsers and email clients are allowed to execute in the organization, ideally only using the latest version of the browsers provided by the vendor in order to take advantage of the latest security functions and fixes.
|-
| System || 7.2 || Uninstall or disable any unnecessary or unauthorized browser or email client plugins or add-on applications. Each plugin shall utilize application / URL whitelisting and only allow the use of the application for pre-approved domains.
|-
| System || 7.3 || Limit the use of unnecessary scripting languages in all web browsers and email clients. This includes the use of languages such as ActiveX and JavaScript on systems where it is unnecessary to support such capabilities.
|-
| System || 7.4 || Log all URL requests from each of the organization's systems, whether onsite or a mobile device, in order to identify potentially malicious activity and assist incident handlers with identifying potentially compromised systems.
|-
| System || 7.5 || Deploy two separate browser configurations to each system. One configuration should disable the use of all plugins, unnecessary scripting languages, and generally be configured with limited functionality and be used for general web browsing. The other configuration shall allow for more browser functionality but should only be used to access specific websites that require the use of such functionality.
|-
| System || 7.6 || The organization shall maintain and enforce network based URL filters that limit a system's ability to connect to websites not approved by the organization. The organization shall subscribe to URL categorization services to ensure that they are up-to-date with the most recent website category definitions available. Uncategorized sites shall be blocked by default. This filtering shall be enforced for each of the organization's systems, whether they are physically at an organization's facilities or not.
|-
| System || 7.7 || To lower the chance of spoofed e-mail messages, implement the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) by deploying SPF records in DNS and enabling receiver-side verification in mail servers.
|-
| System || 7.8 || Scan and block all e-mail attachments entering the organization's e-mail gateway if they contain malicious code or file types that are unnecessary for the organization's business. This scanning should be done before the e-mail is placed in the user's inbox. This includes e-mail content filtering and web content filtering.

|-
| System || 8.1 || Employ automated tools to continuously monitor workstations, servers, and mobile devices with anti-virus, anti-spyware, personal firewalls, and host-based IPS functionality. All malware detection events should be sent to enterprise anti-malware administration tools and event log servers.
|-
| System || 8.2 || Employ anti-malware software that offers a centralized infrastructure that compiles information on file reputations or have administrators manually push updates to all machines. After applying an update, automated systems should verify that each system has received its signature update.
|-
| System || 8.3 || Limit use of external devices to those with an approved, documented business need. Monitor for use and attempted use of external devices. Configure laptops, workstations, and servers so that they will not auto-run content from removable media, like USB tokens (i.e., “thumb drives”), USB hard drives, CDs/DVDs, FireWire devices, external serial advanced technology attachment devices, and mounted network shares. Configure systems so that they automatically conduct an anti-malware scan of removable media when inserted.
|-
| System || 8.4 || Enable anti-exploitation features such as Data Execution Prevention (DEP), Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), virtualization/containerization, etc. For increased protection, deploy capabilities such as Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) that can be configured to apply these protections to a broader set of applications and executables.
|-
| System || 8.5 || Use network-based anti-malware tools to identify executables in all network traffic and use techniques other than signature-based detection to identify and filter out malicious content before it arrives at the endpoint.
|-
| System || 8.6 || Enable domain name system (DNS) query logging to detect hostname lookup for known malicious C2 domains.

|-
| System || 9.1 || Ensure that only ports, protocols, and services with validated business needs are running on each system.
|-
| System || 9.2 || Apply host-based firewalls or port filtering tools on end systems, with a default-deny rule that drops all traffic except those services and ports that are explicitly allowed.
|-
| System || 9.3 || Perform automated port scans on a regular basis against all key servers and compared to a known effective baseline.  If a change that is not listed on the organization’s approved baseline is discovered, an alert should be generated and reviewed.
|-
| System || 9.4 || Verify any server that is visible from the Internet or an untrusted network, and if it is not required for business purposes, move it to an internal VLAN and give it a private address.
|-
| System || 9.5 || Operate critical services on separate physical or logical host machines, such as DNS, file, mail, web, and database servers.
|-

|-
| System || 10.1 || Ensure that each system is automatically backed up on at least a weekly basis, and more often for systems storing sensitive information. To help ensure the ability to rapidly restore a system from backup, the operating system, application software, and data on a machine should each be included in the overall backup procedure. These three components of a system do not have to be included in the same backup file or use the same backup software. There should be multiple backups over time, so that in the event of malware infection, restoration can be from a version that is believed to predate the original infection. All backup policies should be compliant with any regulatory or official requirements.
|-
| System || 10.2 || Test data on backup media on a regular basis by performing a data restoration process to ensure that the backup is properly working.
|-
| System || 10.3 || Ensure that backups are properly protected via physical security or encryption when they are stored, as well as when they are moved across the network.  This includes remote backups and cloud services.
|-
| System || 10.4 || Ensure that key systems have at least one backup destination that is not continuously addressable through operating system calls.  This will mitigate the risk of attacks like CryptoLocker which seek to encrypt or damage data on all addressable data shares, including backup destinations.

|-
| Network || 11.1 || Compare firewall, router, and switch configuration against standard secure configurations defined for each type of network device in use in the organization. The security configuration of such devices should be documented, reviewed, and approved by an organization change control board. Any deviations from the standard configuration or updates to the standard configuration should be documented and approved in a change control system.
|-
| Network || 11.2 || All new configuration rules beyond a baseline-hardened configuration that allow traffic to flow through network security devices, such as firewalls and network-based IPS, should be documented and recorded in a configuration management system, with a specific business reason for each change, a specific individual’s name responsible for that business need, and an expected duration of the need.
|-
| Network || 11.3 || Use automated tools to verify standard device configurations and detect changes. All alterations to such files should be logged and automatically reported to security personnel.
|-
| Network || 11.4 || Manage network devices using two-factor authentication and encrypted sessions.
|-
| Network || 11.5 || Install the latest stable version of any security-related updates on all network devices.
|-
| Network || 11.6 || Network engineers shall use a dedicated machine for all administrative tasks or tasks requiring elevated access. This machine shall be isolated from the organization's primary network and not be allowed Internet access. This machine shall not be used for reading e-mail, composing documents, or surfing the Internet.
|-
| Network || 11.7 || Manage the network infrastructure across network connections that are separated from the business use of that network, relying on separate VLANs or, preferably, on entirely different physical connectivity for management sessions for network devices.

|-
| Network || 12.1 || Deny communications with (or limit data flow to) known malicious IP addresses (black lists), or limit access only to trusted sites (whitelists). Tests can be periodically carried out by sending packets from bogon source IP addresses (non-routable or otherwise unused IP addresses) into the network to verify that they are not transmitted through network perimeters. Lists of bogon addresses are publicly available on the Internet from various sources, and indicate a series of IP addresses that should not be used for legitimate traffic traversing the Internet.
|-
| Network || 12.2 || On DMZ networks, configure monitoring systems (which may be built into the IDS sensors or deployed as a separate technology) to record at least packet header information, and preferably full packet header and payloads of the traffic destined for or passing through the network border.  This traffic should be sent to a properly configured Security Information Event Management (SIEM) or log analytics system so that events can be correlated from all devices on the network.
|-
| Network || 12.3 || Deploy network-based IDS sensors on Internet and extranet DMZ systems and networks that look for unusual attack mechanisms and detect compromise of these systems. These network-based IDS sensors may detect attacks through the use of signatures, network behavior analysis, or other mechanisms to analyze traffic.
|-
| Network || 12.4 || Network-based IPS devices should be deployed to complement IDS by blocking known bad signatures or the behavior of potential attacks.  As attacks become automated, methods such as IDS typically delay the amount of time it takes for someone to react to an attack.  A properly configured network-based IPS can provide automation to block bad traffic. When evaluating network-based IPS products, include those using techniques other than signature-based detection (such as virtual machine or sandbox-based approaches) for consideration.
|-
| Network || 12.5 || Design and implement network perimeters so that all outgoing network traffic to the Internet must pass through at least one application layer filtering proxy server. The proxy should support decrypting network traffic, logging individual TCP sessions, blocking specific URLs, domain names, and IP addresses to implement a black list, and applying whitelists of allowed sites that can be accessed through the proxy while blocking all other sites.  Organizations should force outbound traffic to the Internet through an authenticated proxy server on the enterprise perimeter.
|-
| Network || 12.6 || Require all remote login access (including VPN, dial-up, and other forms of access that allow login to internal systems) to use two-factor authentication.
|-
| Network || 12.7 || All enterprise devices remotely logging into the internal network should be managed by the enterprise, with remote control of their configuration, installed software, and patch levels. For third-party devices (e.g., subcontractors/vendors), publish minimum security standards for access to the enterprise network and perform a security scan before allowing access.
|-
| Network || 12.8 || Periodically scan for back-channel connections to the Internet that bypass the DMZ, including unauthorized VPN connections and dual-homed hosts connected to the enterprise network and to other networks via wireless, dial-up modems, or other mechanisms.  
|-
| Network || 12.9 || Deploy NetFlow collection and analysis to DMZ network flows to detect anomalous activity.
|-
| Network || 12.10 || To help identify covert channels exfiltrating data through a firewall, configure the built-in firewall session tracking mechanisms included in many commercial firewalls to identify TCP sessions that last an unusually long time for the given organization and firewall device, alerting personnel about the source and destination addresses associated with these long sessions.

|-
| Network || 13.1 || Perform an assessment of data to identify sensitive information that requires the application of encryption and integrity controls
|-
| Network || 13.2 || Deploy approved hard drive encryption software to mobile devices and systems that hold sensitive data.
|-
| Network || 13.3 || Deploy an automated tool on network perimeters that monitors for sensitive information (e.g., personally identifiable information), keywords, and other document characteristics to discover unauthorized attempts to exfiltrate data across network boundaries and block such transfers while alerting information security personnel. 
|-
| Network || 13.4 || Conduct periodic scans of server machines using automated tools to determine whether sensitive data (e.g., personally identifiable information, health, credit card, or classified information) is present on the system in clear text. These tools, which search for patterns that indicate the presence of sensitive information, can help identify if a business or technical process is leaving behind or otherwise leaking sensitive information.
|-
| Network || 13.5 || If there is no business need for supporting such devices, configure systems so that they will not write data to USB tokens or USB hard drives. If such devices are required, enterprise software should be used that can configure systems to allow only specific USB devices (based on serial number or other unique property) to be accessed, and that can automatically encrypt all data placed on such devices. An inventory of all authorized devices must be maintained.
|-
| Network || 13.6 || Use network-based DLP solutions to monitor and control the flow of data within the network. Any anomalies that exceed the normal traffic patterns should be noted and appropriate action taken to address them.
|-
| Network || 13.7 || Monitor all traffic leaving the organization and detect any unauthorized use of encryption. Attackers often use an encrypted channel to bypass network security devices. Therefore, it is essential that organizations be able to detect rogue connections, terminate the connection, and remediate the infected system.
|-
| Network || 13.8 || Block access to known file transfer and e-mail exfiltration websites.
|-
| Network || 13.9 || Use host-based data loss prevention (DLP) to enforce ACLs even when data is copied off a server.  In most organizations, access to the data is controlled by ACLs that are implemented on the server.  Once the data have been copied to a desktop system, the ACLs are no longer enforced and the users can send the data to whomever they want.

|-
| Application || 14.1 || Segment the network based on the label or classification level of the information stored on the servers. Locate all sensitive information on separated VLANS with firewall filtering to ensure that only authorized individuals are only able to communicate with systems necessary to fulfill their specific responsibilities.
|-
| Application || 14.2 || All communication of sensitive information over less-trusted networks should be encrypted. Whenever information flows over a network with a lower trust level, the information should be encrypted.
|-
| Application || 14.3 || All network switches will enable Private Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) for segmented workstation networks to limit the ability of devices on a network to directly communicate with other devices on the subnet and limit an attackers ability to laterally move to compromise neighboring systems.
|-
| Application || 14.4 || All information stored on systems shall be protected with file system, network share, claims, application, or database specific access control lists. These controls will enforce the principal that only authorized individuals should have access to the information based on their need to access the information as a part of their responsibilities.
|-
| Application || 14.5 || Sensitive information stored on systems shall be encrypted at rest and require a secondary authentication mechanism, not integrated into the operating system, in order to access the information.
|-
| Application || 14.6 || Enforce detailed audit logging for access to nonpublic data and special authentication for sensitive data.
|-
| Application || 14.7 || Archived data sets or systems not regularly accessed by the organization shall be removed from the organization's network. These systems shall only be used as stand alone systems (disconnected from the network) by the business unit needing to occasionally use the system or completely virtualized and powered off until needed.

|-
| Network || 15.1 || Ensure that each wireless device connected to the network matches an authorized configuration and security profile, with a documented owner of the connection and a defined business need. Organizations should deny access to those wireless devices that do not have such a configuration and profile.
|-
| Network || 15.2 || Configure network vulnerability scanning tools to detect wireless access points connected to the wired network. Identified devices should be reconciled against a list of authorized wireless access points. Unauthorized (i.e., rogue) access points should be deactivated.
|-
| Network || 15.3 || Use wireless intrusion detection systems (WIDS) to identify rogue wireless devices and detect attack attempts and successful compromises. In addition to WIDS, all wireless traffic should be monitored by WIDS as traffic passes into the wired network.
|-
| Network || 15.4 || Where a specific business need for wireless access has been identified, configure wireless access on client machines to allow access only to authorized wireless networks. For devices that do not have an essential wireless business purpose, disable wireless access in the hardware configuration (basic input/output system or extensible firmware interface).
|-
| Network || 15.5 || Ensure that all wireless traffic leverages at least Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption used with at least Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) protection.
|-
| Network || 15.6 || Ensure that wireless networks use authentication protocols such as Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP/TLS), which provide credential protection and mutual authentication.
|-
| Network || 15.7 || Disable peer-to-peer wireless network capabilities on wireless clients.
|-
| Network || 15.8 || Disable wireless peripheral access of devices (such as Bluetooth), unless such access is required for a documented business need.
|-
| Network || 15.9 || Create separate virtual local area networks (VLANs) for BYOD systems or other untrusted devices. Internet access from this VLAN should go through at least the same border as corporate traffic. Enterprise access from this VLAN should be treated as untrusted and filtered and audited accordingly.

|-
| Application || 16.2 || Ensure that all accounts have an expiration date that is monitored and enforced.
|-
| Application || 16.3 || Establish and follow a process for revoking system access by disabling accounts immediately upon termination of an employee or contractor. Disabling instead of deleting accounts allows preservation of audit trails.
|-

|-
| Application || 16.5 || Configure screen locks on systems to limit access to unattended workstations.
|-
| Application || 16.6 || Monitor account usage to determine dormant accounts, notifying the user or user’s manager. Disable such accounts if not needed, or document and monitor exceptions (e.g., vendor maintenance accounts needed for system recovery or continuity operations). Require that managers match active employees and contractors with each account belonging to their managed staff. Security or system administrators should then disable accounts that are not assigned to valid workforce members.
|-
| Application || 16.7 || Use and configure account lockouts such that after a set number of failed login attempts the account is locked for a standard period of time.
|-
| Application || 16.8 || Monitor attempts to access deactivated accounts through audit logging.

|-
| Application || 16.10 || Profile each user’s typical account usage by determining normal time-of-day access and access duration. Reports should be generated that indicate users who have logged in during unusual hours or have exceeded their normal login duration. This includes flagging the use of the user’s credentials from a computer other than computers on which the user generally works.
|-
| Application || 16.11 || Require multi-factor authentication for all user accounts that have access to sensitive data or systems. Multi-factor authentication can be achieved using smart cards, certificates, One Time Password (OTP) tokens, or biometrics.
|-
| Application || 16.12 || Where multi-factor authentication is not supported, user accounts shall be required to use long passwords on the system (longer than 14 characters).
|-
| Application || 16.13 || Ensure that all account usernames and authentication credentials are transmitted across networks using encrypted channels.

|-
| Application || 17.2 || Deliver training to fill the skills gap. If possible, use more senior staff to deliver the training. A second option is to have outside teachers provide training onsite so the examples used will be directly relevant. If you have small numbers of people to train, use training conferences or online training to fill the gaps.
|-
| Application || 17.3 || Implement an security awareness program that (1) focuses only on the methods commonly used in intrusions that can be blocked through individual action, (2) is delivered in short online modules convenient for employees (3) is updated frequently (at least annually) to represent the latest attack techniques, (4) is mandated for completion by all employees at least annually, and (5) is reliably monitored for employee completion.
|-
| Application || 17.4 || Validate and improve awareness levels through periodic tests to see whether employees will click on a link from suspicious e-mail or provide sensitive information on the telephone without following appropriate procedures for authenticating a caller; targeted training should be provided to those who fall victim to the exercise.
|-
| Application || 17.5 || Use security skills assessments for each of the mission-critical roles to identify skills gaps. Use hands-on, real-world examples to measure mastery. If you do not have such assessments, use one of the available online competitions that simulate real-world scenarios for each of the identified jobs in order to measure skills mastery.

|-
| Application || 18.2 || Protect web applications by deploying web application firewalls (WAFs) that inspect all traffic flowing to the web application for common web application attacks, including but not limited to cross-site scripting, SQL injection, command injection, and directory traversal attacks. For applications that are not web-based, specific application firewalls should be deployed if such tools are available for the given application type.  If the traffic is encrypted, the device should either sit behind the encryption or be capable of decrypting the traffic prior to analysis.  If neither option is appropriate, a host-based web application firewall should be deployed.
|-
| Application || 18.3 || For in-house developed software, ensure that explicit error checking is performed and documented for all input, including for size, data type, and acceptable ranges or formats. 
|-
| Application || 18.4 || Test in-house-developed and third-party-procured web applications for common security weaknesses using automated remote web application scanners prior to deployment, whenever updates are made to the application, and on a regular recurring basis. In particular, input validation and output encoding routines of application software should be reviewed and tested.
|-
| Application || 18.5 || Do not display system error messages to end-users (output sanitization).
|-
| Application || 18.6 || Maintain separate environments for production and nonproduction systems. Developers should not typically have unmonitored access to production environments.

| Application || 20.5 || Plan clear goals of the penetration test itself with blended attacks in mind, identifying the goal machine or target asset.  Many APT-style attacks deploy multiple vectors&amp;mdash;often social engineering combined with web or network exploitation.  Red Team manual or automated testing that captures pivoted and multi-vector attacks offers a more realistic assessment of security posture and risk to critical assets.
|-
| Application || 20.6 || Use vulnerability scanning and penetration testing tools in concert.  The results of vulnerability scanning assessments should be used as a starting point to guide and focus penetration testing efforts.
|-
| Application || 20.7 || Wherever possible, ensure that Red Teams results are documented using open, machine-readable standards (e.g., SCAP).  Devise a scoring method for determining the results of Red Team exercises so that results can be compared over time.
|-
| Application || 20.8 || Create a test bed that mimics a production environment for specific penetration tests and Red Team attacks against elements that are not typically tested in production, such as attacks against supervisory control and data acquisition and other control systems.

== Career ==
She first thought of becoming a sex surrogate partner after reading ''Surrogate Wife: The Story of a Masters &amp; Johnson Sexual Therapist and the Nine Cases She Treated'' by Valerie Scott. In 1973 she took San Francisco Sex Information's (SFSI) training, and was a member of their training staff for 20 years. She studied the work of [[Masters and Johnson]], and works with many of the San Francisco Bay Area's premiere [[sex therapist]]s.

Cohen Greene is a certified Clinical Sexologist and a sex surrogate partner. Her official title is Surrogate Partner Therapist. She is a  member of IPSA (International Professional Surrogates Association). In October 2004 she received her 'Doctorate in Human Sexuality' from the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco. She has stated about her profession: "People have asked me over the years, 'How do you work with people who are differently abled?' I always say, it's not hard for me. I just have to learn what their special needs are." She has appeared on shows like ''[[Larry King Live]]'', the ''[[Joy Behar Show]]'' and ''[[The Jeff Probst Show]]'' discussing her profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/the-reel-breakdown/adams-reel-women-cheryl-cohen-greene-helen-hunt-232704955.html | contribution = Adams on Reel Women: Cheryl Cohen Greene and Helen Hunt fete ‘The Sessions’ | title = The Reel Breakdown | publisher = Yahoo!

Not all European countries use CEVNI for their inland waterways. The [[United Kingdom]], the [[Nordic countries]], [[Spain]], [[Italy]] and the [[Balkans]] except [[Croatia]] have their own regulations.

CEVNI contains the core uniform rules applicable to the traffic on inland waterways, such as visual signs on vessels, sound signals and radiotelephony, waterway signs and markings, rules of the road, berthing rules, and prevention of pollution of water and disposal of waste.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4638">{{Disputed|date=January 2015}} In [[solid mechanics]], in the field of [[rotordynamics]], the '''critical speed''' is the theoretical [[angular velocity]] that excites the [[natural frequency]] of a rotating object, such as a shaft, propeller, [[leadscrew#Running_speed | leadscrew]], or gear. As the speed of rotation approaches the object's natural frequency, the object begins to [[resonate]], which dramatically increases system [[vibration]]. The resulting resonance occurs regardless of orientation. When the rotational speed is equal to the numerical value of the natural vibration, then that speed is referred to as critical speed.

==Critical speed of shafts==
All rotating shafts, even in the absence of external load, will deflect during rotation. The unbalanced mass of the rotating object causes deflection that will create resonant vibration at certain speeds, known as the critical speeds. The magnitude of deflection depends upon the following:
:(a) stiffness of the shaft and its support
:(b) total mass of shaft and attached parts
:(c) unbalance of the mass with respect to the axis of rotation
:(d) the amount of damping in the system

In general, it is necessary to calculate the critical speed of a rotating shaft, such as a fan shaft, in order to avoid issues with noise and vibration.

==Critical speed equation==
Like vibrating [[Vibrating_string|strings]] and other elastic structures, shafts and beams can vibrate in different mode shapes, with corresponding natural frequencies. The first vibrational mode corresponds to the lowest natural frequency. Higher modes of vibration correspond to higher natural frequencies. Often when considering rotating shafts, only the first natural frequency is needed. 

There are two main methods used to calculate critical speed—the [[Rayleigh–Ritz method]] and [[Dunkerley's method]]. Both calculate an approximation of the first natural frequency of vibration, which is assumed to be nearly equal to the critical speed of rotation. The Rayleigh–Ritz method is discussed here. For a shaft that is divided into ''n'' segments, the first natural frequency for a given beam, in ''rad/s'', can be approximated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{1} \approx \sqrt{\frac {g \sum_ {i = 1}^n {w_ {i} y_ {i}}} {\sum_ {i = 1}^n {w_ {i} y_ {i}^2}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is the acceleration of gravity, and the &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; are the weights of each segment, and the &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; are the static deflections (under gravitational loading only) of the center of each segment. Generally speaking, if ''n'' is 2 or higher, this method tends to slightly overestimate the first natural frequency, with the estimate becoming better the higher ''n'' is. If ''n'' is only 1, this method tends to underestimate the first natural frequency, but the equation simplifies to:

:&lt;math&gt;\omega_{1} \approx \sqrt{\frac {g} {y_{max}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;y_{max}&lt;/math&gt; is the max static deflection of the shaft. These speeds are in [[radians|''rad'']]/''s'', but can be converted to [[Revolutions_per_minute|''RPM'']] by multiplying by &lt;math&gt;\frac{60}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt; .

Static deflections for several types of uniform-cross-section beams can be found [[Deflection_(engineering)#Beam_deflection_for_various_loads_and_supports|here]]. If a beam has multiple types of loading, deflections can be found for each, and then summed. If the shaft diameter changes along its length, deflection calculations become much more difficult.

The static deflection expresses the relationship between rigidity of the shaft and inertial forces; it includes all the loads applied to the shaft when placed horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Bulletin, [http://www.ewp.rpi.edu/hartford/~ernesto/F2013/SRDD/Readings/Kruger-CriticalSpeeds-Shafts.pdf], ''Krueger''. Retrieved on 18 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relationship is valid no matter what the orientation of the shaft is. 

Critical speed depends upon the magnitude and location of the shaft unbalance, the length of the shaft, its diameter, and the kind of bearing support. Many practical applications suggest as good practice that the maximum operating speed should not exceed 75% of the critical speed; however, there are cases that require speeds above the critical speed to work correctly. In such cases, it is important to accelerate the shaft through the first natural frequency quickly so that large deflections don't develop.

A United States '''data item description''' ('''DID''') is a completed document defining the data [[deliverable]]s required of a [[United States Department of Defense]] contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''DoD 4120.24-M, Defense Standardization Program (DSP) Policies and Procedures'' | url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/412024m.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=Office of the Undersecretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, [[United States Department of Defense]] March-2000 | pages=57 |accessdate=July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A DID specifically defines the data content, format, and intended use of the data with a primary objective of achieving standardization objectives by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]]. The content and format requirements for DIDs are defined within ''MIL-STD-963C, Data Item Descriptions (2014)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''MIL-STD-963C, Department of Defense Standard Practice: Data Item Descriptions'' | url=http://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=202450 | publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | date=September 24, 2014  |accessdate=February 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
The terminology of DIDs and the term [[contract data requirements list]] (CDRL) originated with US military procurements, and it is now often encountered in other large procurements that are modeled after the military procurement process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=''Deliverables: CDRLs and DIDs'' | url=http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/enterprise-solutions/deliverable-cdrls-amp-dids-31435 | publisher=Toolbox.com |accessdate=July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a military solicitation or contract, each DID is uniquely numbered to identify the data deliverables in terms of specific information such as: purpose, description, preparation instructions including a table of contents and descriptions of each section, and references to the Contract [[Statement of work]] (SOW).

Practices and terms where definition is given by MIL-STD-963:

* Tailoring of data requirements. The deletion of the applicability of a portion of the data requirements from an approved DID that are unnecessary to meet the needs of a specific contract.
* Format. The desired organization, structure, or arrangement of the content of the data product described by the DID. This term relates to the shape, size, makeup, style, physical organization, or arrangement of the data product described in the DID.
* Content.  The desired subject(s), topic(s), or element(s) which constitutes the data product described in the DID (for example, a string of defined data elements for entry into a Government database; a listing of paragraph titles or topics for inclusion in a data deliverable) under general topics; or subject matter which may be further defined into sub-topics.

* DID number:  Each DID is assigned a unique three-part identifier by the DID approval authority.  An example DID number for repetitive use is DI-SESS-80013B (DI- Data Item; SESS – four character code for the "Systems Engineering" Standardization Area (see "SD-1, Standardization Directory" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''SD-1, Standardization Directory'' |url=http://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=113341 |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] | df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; for descriptions); 80013 assigned by ASSIST Automated Document Number Module, and B the sequential version). An example DID number for one-time use is OT-13-1000 (OT- One Time; 13 – [[fiscal year]] issued; 10000 – (the first number assigned in FY13 by the Army).

Since DID documents are what contract mechanics cause to be produced, the defined content guidelines and their terminologies are commonly referred to in [[United States Military Standard]]s or other forms of procedural and administrative guidance of the [[United States Department of Defense]].

== Usage in government contracts ==
Writers of a [[Statement of work|SOW]] often include requirements that belong in other parts of a contract. Specifically, quantitative technical requirements are addressed in the military specification and work requirements are specified in the SOW, and data requirements (e.g., delivery, format, and content) should be in the [[Contract Data Requirements List|CDRL]] along with the appropriate DID to minimize the potential for conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=MIL-HDBK-245D, Department of Defense: Handbook for Preparation of Statement of Work (SOW) | year=1996 | pages=ii | url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-HDBK/MIL-HDBK-0200-0299/MIL-HDBK-245D_1888/ |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=MIL-HDBK-245D, Department of Defense: Handbook for Preparation of Statement of Work (SOW) | year=1996 | pages=ii | url=http://quicksearch.dla.mil/qsDocDetails.aspx?ident_number=53962 |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.svg|thumb|320px|Nitrogen cycle.]]

'''Denitrification''' is a microbially facilitated process where nitrate is reduced and ultimately produces molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through a series of intermediate gaseous nitrogen oxide products. It is the third party of bacteria that completes the Nitrogen cycle. Facultative anaerobic bacteria perform denitrification as a type of respiration that [[redox|reduces]] oxidized forms of nitrogen in response to the oxidation of an [[electron donor]] such as [[organic matter]]. The preferred nitrogen [[electron acceptor]]s in order of most to least thermodynamically favorable include [[nitrate]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[nitrite]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[nitric oxide]] (NO), [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) finally resulting in the production of [[dinitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) completing the [[nitrogen cycle]]. Denitrifying microbes require a very low oxygen concentration of less than 10%, as well as [[Organic compound|organic C]] for energy. Since denitrification can remove NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, reducing its [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] to groundwater, it can be strategically used to treat sewage or animal residues of high nitrogen content. Denitrification can leak N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which is an [[ozone-depleting substance]] and a [[greenhouse gas]] that can have a considerable influence on global warming.

The process is performed primarily by [[heterotrophic]] [[bacteria]] (such as ''[[Paracoccus denitrificans]]'' and various [[pseudomonadaceae|pseudomonads]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carlson | first1 = C.

== Overview ==

=== Half reactions ===
Denitrification generally proceeds through some combination of the following half reactions, with the enzyme catalyzing the reaction in parentheses:
* NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;→  {{chem|NO|2}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  (Nitrate reductase)
* {{chem|NO|2}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; +  e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; →  NO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  (Nitrite reductase)
* 2 NO + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; +  2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; →  {{chem|N|2|O}} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Nitric oxide reductase)
* {{chem|N|2|O}} + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; +  2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|N|2 }} + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  (Nitrous oxide reductase) 
The complete process can be expressed as a net balanced [[redox]] reaction, where [[nitrate]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) gets fully reduced to [[dinitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;):
* 2 NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 10 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 12 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

=== Conditions of denitrification ===
In nature, denitrification can take place in both terrestrial and marine [[ecosystem]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seitzinger|first1=S.|last2=Harrison|first2=J.

In these areas, nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) or nitrite ({{chem|NO|2}}&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) can be used as a substitute terminal electron acceptor instead of [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a more energetically favourable electron acceptor. Terminal electron acceptor is a compound that gets reduced in the reaction by receiving electrons.

Furthermore, denitrification can occur in oxic environments as well. High activity of denitrifers can be observed in the intertidal zones, where the tidal cycles cause fluctuations of oxygen concentration in sandy coastal sediments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merchant et al.|first=|date=2017|title=Denitrifying community in coastal sediments performs aerobic and anaerobic respiration simultaneously|pmid=28463234|pmc=5520038|journal=The ISME Journal|volume=11|issue=8|pages=1799–1812|via=US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health|doi=10.1038/ismej.2017.51}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the bacterial species ''Paracoccus denitrificans'' engages in denitrification under both oxic and anoxic conditions simultaneously.

Denitrification can lead to a condition called [[Isotope fractionation|isotopic fractionation]] in the soil environment. The two stable isotopes of nitrogen, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N are both found in the sediment profiles. The lighter isotope of nitrogen, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N, is preferred during denitrification, leaving the heavier nitrogen isotope, &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N, in the residual matter. This selectivity leads to the enrichment of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N in the biomass compared to &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dähnke K.; Thamdrup B.|first=|date=2013|title=Nitrogen isotope dynamics and fractionation during sedimentary denitrification in Boknis Eck, Baltic Sea|journal=Biogeosciences|volume=10|issue=5|pages=3079–3088|via=Copernicus Publications|doi=10.5194/bg-10-3079-2013|bibcode=2013BGeo...10.3079D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the relative abundance of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;N can be analyzed to distinguish denitrification apart from other processes in nature.

==Use in wastewater treatment==
{{Further|Sewage treatment}}
Denitrification is commonly used to remove nitrogen from [[sewage]] and municipal [[wastewater]]. It is also an instrumental process in [[constructed wetland]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bachand | first1 = P. A. M. | last2 = Horne | first2 = A.

Reduction under anoxic conditions can also occur through process called anaerobic ammonium oxidation ([[anammox]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dalsgaard | first1 = T. | last2 = Thamdrup | first2 = B. | last3 = Canfield | first3 = D.

Aerobic denitrification, conducted by aerobic denitrifiers, may offer the potential to eliminate the need for separate tanks and reduce sludge yield. There are less stringent alkalinity requirements because alkalinity generated during denitrification can partly compensate for the alkalinity consumption in nitrification&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.

'''Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder''' (DSED) or '''Disinhibited Attachment Disorder of Childhood''' is an [[attachment disorder]] that consists of "a pattern of behavior in which a child actively approaches and interacts with unfamiliar adults." and which "...significantly impairs young children’s abilities to relate interpersonally to adults and peers."&lt;ref name="Theravive" &gt;''Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders'' (5th ed.). Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Publishing quoted in [http://www.theravive.com/therapedia/Disinhibited-Social-Engagement-Disorder-DSM--5-313.89-(F94.2) The Theravive website]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sitting on the lap of a stranger or peer, or leaving with a stranger. DSED is exclusively a childhood disorder and is not diagnosed before the age of nine months or if symptoms did not appear until after the age of five. Infants and very young children are at risk if they receive inconsistent or insufficient care from a primary caregiver.

==Symptoms==
The most obvious symptom is "...the absence of normal fear or discretion when approaching strangers. The child is unusually comfortable talking to, touching, and leaving a location with an adult stranger."&lt;ref name="Theravive"/&gt; DSED has some similar symptoms of [[Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder]] (ADHD).
===Comorbidity===
Cognitive delay

Language delay

Speech delay&lt;ref name="ccpcchicago.org"/&gt;

==Risk factors==
DSED is a result of inconsistent or absent connection to a primary caregiver in the first years of life. Children who are institutionalized may receive inconsistent care, isolation during hospitalization, and parental problems such as mental health problems which interfere with attachment such as depression or a personality disorder, absence, poverty, teen parenting, or substance abuse. DSED "...may have a biological cause in some cases (e.g., [[Williams syndrome]])."

==Diagnosis==
The criteria for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder in the DSM-5:

A. A pattern of behavior in which a child actively approaches and interacts with unfamiliar adults and exhibits at least two of the following:

# Reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting with unfamiliar adults.
# Overly familiar verbal or physical behavior (that is not consistent with culturally sanctioned and with age-appropriate social boundaries).
# Diminished or absent checking back with adult caregiver after venturing away, even in unfamiliar settings.
# Willingness to go off with an unfamiliar adult with little or no hesitation.

B. The behaviors in Criterion A are not limited to impulsivity (as in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) but include socially disinhibited behavior.

C.  The child has exhibited a pattern of extremes of insufficient care as evidenced by at least one of the following:

# Social neglect or deprivation in the form of persistent lack of having basic emotional needs for comfort, stimulation and affection met by caregiving adults.
# Repeated changes of primary caregivers that limit ability to form stable attachments (e.g., frequent changes in foster care).
# Rearing in unusual settings that severely limit opportunities to form selective attachments (e.g., institutions with high child to caregiver ratios).

D. The care in Criterion C is presumed to be responsible for the disturbed behavior in Criterion A (e.g., the disturbances in Criterion A began following the pathogenic care in Criterion C).

E. The child has a developmental age of at least nine months."&lt;ref&gt;[http://drgrcevich.wordpress.com/2013/06/18/disinhibited-social-engagement-disorder/ Steve Grcevich. "Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder". Church4EveryChild June 18, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Specifiers'''

It is considered persistent if the duration is more than 12 months.

It is considered severe if all the symptoms are present.&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2013"/&gt;

The ICD-10 definition is: "A particular pattern of abnormal social functioning that arises during the first five years of life and that tends to persist despite marked changes in environmental circumstances, e.g. diffuse, nonselectively focused attachment behaviour, attention-seeking and indiscriminately friendly behaviour, poorly modulated peer interactions; depending on circumstances there may also be associated emotional or behavioural disturbance."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Ylb6Qw8PVEC ''International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems''. 10th revision. ed. Geneva: World Health Organization, 19921994. Print.]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Differential diagnosis===
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder&lt;ref name="ccpcchicago.org"&gt;https://www.ccpcchicago.org/xm_client/client_documents/Fostering%20Connections%20CCPC.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Two effective treatment approaches are [[play therapy]] and [[expressive therapy]] help form attachment through multi-sensory means and some therapy can be non-verbal. {{&lt;ref&gt;Steffen, H. (2007). Integrative Expressive Therapy: A program development for children. The Chicago School of Professional Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Epidemiology==
The exact prevalence is unknown. In high risk individuals, the prevalence rate is 20%.&lt;ref name="American Psychiatric Association 2013"&gt;American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition. Arlington, VA, American Psychiatric Association, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder (DSM-5 313.89 (F94.2)) is the 2013 [[DSM-5|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)]] name formerly listed as a subtype of [[reactive attachment disorder]] (RAD) called ''disinhibited attachment disorder'' (DAD). The corresponding disorder in [[ICD-10]] is Disinhibited Attachment Disorder of Childhood.

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] considers "...disinhibited social engagement disorder more closely resembles ADHD; it may occur in children who do not necessarily lack attachments and may have established or even secure attachments. The two disorders differ in other important ways, including correlates, course, and response to intervention, and for these reasons are considered separate disorders."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204551/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf |date=October 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''epipharyngeal groove''' is a ciliated groove along the dorsal side of the inside of the pharynx in some [[plankton]]-feeding early [[chordate]]s, such as ''[[Amphioxus]]''. It helps to carry a stream of mucus with plankton stuck in it, through the pharynx into the gut to be digested.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Hyman's Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy|author1=Hyman, L.H.|author2=Wake, M.H.|date=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226870137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VKlWjdOkiMwC|page=71|accessdate=2014-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''subnotochordal rod''' or '''hypochord'''  is a transient structure that appears ventral to the [[notochord]] in the heads of embryos of some vertebrates. Its appearance is stimulated by a chemical secreted by the notochord. The subnotochordal rod helps to stimulate development of the [[dorsal aorta]].&lt;ref name="biologists"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Development |volume=127|pages=869–879|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/127/4/869.full.pdf|date=25 January 2000|title=Endoderm patterning by the notochord: development of the hypochord in Xenopus|author=O.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7577">Within the guidelines of '''[[halacha]]''', as presented by ''[[chazal]]'' and [[rishonim|early]] rabbinic authorities,''' [[fellatio]] '''is classified as ביאה דרך איברים (penetration by way of the limbs) or מעשה חידודים בעלמא (general acts of sharpening).

Peripheral halachic discussion of the topic revolves upon whether or not a husband may engage in varying sexually-gratifying acts with his wife – including fellatio – performed up to and including a complete extra-vaginal ejaculation.

The discussion includes the opinion of the permitting authorities limiting their permit to specific frequencies and timings, the consensus being that any halachic-permit ("''hetter''") is solely applicable within the exclusive framework of a [[Torah Laws|Torah]]-permitted marital relationship and strictly during the time that one's wife is not in her ''[[niddah]]'' state.

==Rambam==
The original Hebrew text of the ''[[Mishnah Torah]]'' of the [[Rambam]], as translated by [[Yosef Qafih]], shows the Rambam takes a lenient approach that permits all that a man desires to do with his wife. The presentation omits the customary [[Prohibition of extracting semen in vain (Judaism)|prohibition on extracting semen in vain]], which Qafih quarantines as an addition by a subsequent unknown editor. The Rambam's commentary to the [[Mishnah]] likewise hints at a lenient stance.&lt;ref&gt;Rambam Mishna commentary to [[Tractate Sanhedrin]] [[s:he:רמב"ם על סנהדרין ז#משנה ד|7:4]] (..כל מה שרוצה לעשות באשתו עושה לפי שהענין..האסור והמותר אינן בענין המרוחק והשנוא והמרוצה והאהוב ומה שראוי לעשות מדרך הצניעות  ותכלית הפרישות)&lt;/ref&gt;

== On occasion ==

[[Chazal]] have in certain instances permitted intentional extra-vaginal ejaculation in tandem with one's wife.&lt;ref&gt;The [[tannaim]] [[Rabbi Eliezer]] and [[Rabbi Meir]] ([[Tosefta]], Niddah 2:), for safety reasons (prior to the advent of female [[birth control]]) permits exterior ejaculation for a duration of 24 months post childbirth (Talmud Yebamoth 34).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tosefot]] cites the opinion of Rabbi Yitzchak ([[Isaac ben Samuel]]) who permits an occasional complete extra-vaginal ejaculation with one's wife on condition that one does not accustom himself to ''always'' doing so (Tosfoth, [[Yebamot]]h [[s:he:יבמות לד ב#תוספות|34b]]; Tosfoth, [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] [[s:he:סנהדרין נח ב#תוספות|58b]]). The ''Bayit Chadash'' ([[Yoel Sirkis]]) commentary to the [[Rabbeinu Asher]] (ibid.) explicitly permits this foreign ejaculation with Rabbeinu Asher siding with the Tosafist opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbeinu Asher to Yebamoth ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion is likewise quoted in ''[[Tur Shulchan Aruch]]'', ''[[Even Ha'ezer]]'' ch. 25.

The ''Bayis Chodosh'' sourced his views based on the Talmudic tract of Yebamoth;

{{Quote|It isn't comparable to the action of Er and Onan only if one is accustomed to doing so all the time, but if it is performed on occasion when he desire his wife for non-vaginal relations—it is permitted ...as whatever a man desires to do with his wife he may as per the (''chazalic'') parable of meat that is acquired from the butcher and fish from the fisherman (Tractate [[Nedarim (tractate)|Nedarim]], [[s:he:נדרים כ ב|20b]])|Hagahot HaBach to Tractate Yebamoth 34b}}

Thus Rabbenu Asher, followed by Rabbi [[Elijah Spira]], commented that an occasional exterior ejaculation in tandem with one's wife is not considered "extracting semen in vain" (and not banned by the Talmud) as long as the intention is not to avoid impregnating one's wife ''and'' it is done on occasion, as this is not likened to the desire of [[Onan]] who wished to avoid impregnating [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] entirely.&lt;ref&gt;"Eliyah rabbah" to ch. 240 of Orach Chayim, 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Aguddah]]'' work also sides with the lenient opinion permitting an occasional extra-vaginal ejaculation with one's wife,&lt;ref&gt;Agudah, p. 115 col. 2&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Rabbi Samuel Eidels (the [[Maharsha]]) likewise taking a lenient view.&lt;ref&gt;Maharsha to Talmud Nedarim 20a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parable of meat and fish==
In a varying text of [[Minor tractate|Kallah Rabthi]] as printed by Rabbi [[Solomon Aaron Wertheimer]] in "''Battei Medrashoth''",&lt;ref&gt;of the Cairo geniza: http://www.hebrewbooks.org/21179 vol. 1 p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi Werthheimer notes the significance of the Talmud quoting both meat and fish in its parable depicting the enhanced permissiveness of sexually gratifying activities that one may perform with his wife;

Since the Torah forbids [[Milk and meat in Jewish law|cooking one's meat in milk]], a parable quoting just meat would not suffice as meat has this restrictive element whereas fish has a lesser restrictive element, thus implying that man has an enhanced level of (sexual) freedom with his wife.

==As often as needed==
A more explicit permissive stance is that of the tosafist rabbi [[Isaiah di Trani|Isaiah di Trani the Elder]] who hints that a complete extra-vaginal ejaculation is permitted whenever needed to "seat" one's desire with the stark exclusion being to avoid pregnancy;

{{Quote|What was the (forbidden) action of Er and Onan that the torah prohibits? that committed with the intent of not diminishing her beauty (due to pregnancy) and he doesn't desire to fulfill the [[mitzvah]] of procreation (פרו ורבו) with her. But if his intent.. is for his inclination and to satisfy his desire and his intent is not to avoid impregnating her, it is permitted, ..he whose intent is to fulfill the desire of his inclination does not transgress as "all that a man wants to do with his wife he may do" (Tractate Nedarim, 20b) -and this isn't called "wasting his seed"|Tosfoth Ri"d to Tractate Yebamoth, p. 12b (Yad HaRav Herzog, Jerusalem)}}

Rabbi Isaiah the Elder's view is likewise echoed by his descendant, Rabbi [[Isaiah di Trani the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ria"z", jerusalem 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Eleazar of Worms]], in his recently published Torah commentary to the verse "Adam and his wife, and where not embarrassed" (Genesis) permits any activity with one's wife necessary to "quiet (lit. seat)" his desire.&lt;ref&gt;Rokeach to the Torah (J. Kluggman, Bnei Brak), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active participation===
Later rabbinic authorities differentiated between masturbation (self-extracting semen in vain) and an extra-vaginal ejaculation achieved with the active participation of one's Torah-permitted partner - with the former being forbidden under most if not all circumstances. Apparently, any halachic permit for an extra-vaginal ejaculation must be accompanied by the active participation of one's wife.

From among rabbis of the [[achronim]] era, the [[Tzemach Tzedek]] differentiated between extracting one's seed alone ("masturbation upon trees and stones") and extra-vaginal extracting of one's semen with the active participation of one's wife, with the latter classified as a form of a tandem relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Responsa, ch. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67504">The '''five-planet Nice model''' is a recent variation of the [[Nice model]] that begins with five [[giant planet]]s, the current four plus an additional [[ice giant]], in a chain of mean-motion resonances. After the [[orbital resonance|resonance]] chain is broken, the five giant planets undergo a period of planetesimal-driven migration, followed by a gravitational instability similar to that in the original Nice model. During the instability the additional giant planet is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is ejected from the [[Solar System]] following an encounter with Jupiter. An [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|early Solar System]] with five giant planets was proposed in 2011 after numerical models indicated that this is more likely to reproduce the current Solar System.&lt;ref name=Nesvorny_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nesvorný|first=David|title=Young Solar System's Fifth Giant Planet?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2011|volume=742|issue=2|pages=L22|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/742/2/L22|arxiv = 1109.2949 |bibcode = 2011ApJ...742L..22N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A five-planet Nice model==

The following is a version of the five-planet Nice model that results in a late instability and reproduces a number of aspects of the current Solar System. The early Solar System may have evolved differently, however, with the instability occurring [[Five-planet Nice model#Timing of the instability|soon after]] the dissipation of the gas nebula,&lt;ref name="Kaib_Chambers_2016" /&gt; or with the giant planets [[Five-planet Nice model#Initial conditions|beginning]] in another resonance chain.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt;

The Solar System ends its [[nebular hypothesis|nebula phase]] with [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], and the three ice giants in a 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 resonance chain with [[semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] ranging from 5.5 – 20 [[astronomical unit|AU]]. A dense disk of [[planetesimal]]s orbits beyond these [[planet]]s, extending from 24 AU to 30 AU. [[impact event|Collisions]] between planetesimals in the outer disk produce debris that is ground to dust in a cascade of collisions. The dust spirals inward toward the planets due to [[Poynting–Robertson effect|Poynting-Robertson drag]] and eventually reaches [[Neptune]]'s orbit. Gravitational interactions with the dust allow the giant planets to escape from the resonance chain roughly ten million years after the dissipation of the [[Circumstellar disc|gas disk]]. After a series of distant planetary encounters the planets settle into an extended period of slow dust-driven migration.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt; Their orbits slowly diverge over four hundred million years,&lt;ref name="Bottke_2012" /&gt; until Neptune approaches the inner edge of the planetesimal disk.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt;

The migration of the planets then accelerates and transitions to a [[Planetary migration#Planetesimal-driven migration|planetesimal-driven migration]] as Neptune encounters and exchanges [[angular momentum]] with an increasing number of planetesimals.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt; A net inward transfer of planetesimals and outward migration of Neptune occur during these encounters as most of those [[gravity assist|scattered]] outward return to be encountered again while some of those scattered inward are prevented from returning after encountering [[Uranus]]. A similar process occurs for Uranus, the extra ice giant, and Saturn resulting in their outward migration and a transfer of planetesimals inward from the outer belt to Jupiter. Jupiter, in contrast, ejects most of the planetesimals from the Solar System, and as a result migrates inward.&lt;ref name="Tsiganis_etal_2005" /&gt; After 10 million years the divergent migration of the planets leads to resonance crossings, exciting the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricities]] of the giant planets and destabilizing the planetary system when Neptune is near 28 AU.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_2015-a" /&gt;

During this instability the extra ice giant enters a Saturn-crossing orbit and is scattered inward by Saturn onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit. Repeated gravitational encounters with the ice giant cause jumps in Jupiter's and Saturn's semi-major axes, driving a step-wise separation of their orbits, leading to a rapid increase of the ratio of their [[orbital period|period]]s until it is greater than 2.3.&lt;ref name="Brasser_etal_2009" /&gt; The ice giant also encounters Uranus and Neptune and crosses parts of the [[asteroid belt]] as these encounters increase the eccentricity and semi-major axis of its orbit.&lt;ref name="Roig_Nesvorny_2015" /&gt; After 10,000–100,000 years,&lt;ref name="Morbidelli_etal_2010" /&gt; the ice giant is ejected from the Solar System following an encounter with Jupiter, becoming a [[rogue planet]].&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_2011" /&gt; The remaining planets then continue to migrate at a declining rate and slowly approach their final orbits as most of the remaining planetesimal disk is removed.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_etal_2016" /&gt;

The migrations of the giant planets and encounters between them have many effects throughout the Solar System.

In the original Nice model Jupiter and Saturn's eccentricities are excited when they cross their 2:1 [[orbital resonance|resonance]], destabilizing the [[Solar System#Outer Solar System|outer Solar System]]. A series of gravitational encounters ensues during which Uranus and Neptune are scattered outward into the planetesimal disk.

===Ejected planet===

The encounters between the ice giant and Jupiter in the jumping-Jupiter scenario often lead to the ejection of the ice giant. For this ice giant to be retained its eccentricity must be damped by [[dynamical friction]] with the planetesimal disk, raising its perihelion beyond Saturn's orbit. The planetesimal disk masses typically used in the Nice model are often insufficient for this, leaving systems beginning with four giant planets with only three at the end of the instability. The ejection of the ice giant can be avoided if the disk mass is larger, but the separation of Jupiter and Saturn often grows too large and their eccentricities become too small as the larger disk is cleared. These problems led David Nesvorný of the [[Southwest Research Institute]] to propose that the Solar System began with five giant planets, with an additional Neptune-mass planet between Saturn and Uranus.&lt;ref name=Nesvorny_2011 /&gt; Using thousands of simulations with a variety of initial conditions he found that the simulations beginning with five giant planets were ten times more likely to reproduce the orbits of the outer planets.&lt;ref name=Stuart_2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Stuart|first=Colin|title=Was a giant planet ejected from our solar system?|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2011/nov/21/was-a-giant-planet-ejected-from-our-solar-system|publisher=Physics World|accessdate=16 January 2014|date=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up study by David Nesvorný and Alessandro Morbidelli found that the required jump in the ratio of Jupiter's and Saturn's periods occurred and the orbits of the outer planets were reproduced in 5% of simulations for one five-planet system vs less than 1% for four-planet systems. The most successful began with a significant migration of Neptune, disrupting the planetesimal disk, before planetary encounters were triggered by resonance crossing. This reduces secular friction, allowing Jupiter's eccentricity to be preserved after it is excited by resonance crossings and planetary encounters.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_Morbidelli_2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nesvorný |first=David |last2=Morbidelli |first2=Alessandro |title=Statistical Study of the Early Solar System's Instability with Four, Five, and Six Giant Planets |journal=The Astronomical Journal |date=2012 |volume=144 |issue=4 |page=17 |doi=10.1088/0004-6256/144/4/117 |arxiv=1208.2957 |bibcode=2012AJ....144..117N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Konstantin Batygin]], [[Michael E.

A number of previous works also modeled Solar Systems with extra giant planets. A study by Thommes, Bryden, Wu, and Rasio included simulations of four and five planets beginning in resonant chains. Loose resonant chains of four or five planets with Jupiter and Saturn beginning in a 2:1 resonance often resulted in the loss of an ice giant for small mass planetesimal disks. The loss of a planet was avoided in four planet systems with a larger planetesimal disk but no scattering of planets occurred. A more compact system with Jupiter and Saturn in a 3:2 resonance sometimes resulted in encounters occurring between Jupiter and Saturn.&lt;ref name="Thommes_etal_2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thommes|first1=Edward W.|last2=Bryden|first2=Geoffrey|last3=Wu|first3=Yanqin|last4=Rasio|first4=Frederic A|title=From Mean Motion Resonances to Scattered Planets: Producing the Solar System, Eccentric Exoplanets, and Late Heavy Bombardments|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2007|volume=675|issue=2|pages=1538–1548|doi=10.1086/525244|arxiv=0706.1235|bibcode=2008ApJ...675.1538T}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Morbidelli, Tsiganis, Crida, Levison, and Gomes was more successful in reproducing the Solar System beginning with a four planet system in a compact resonant chain.

===Initial conditions===

The giant planets begin in a chain of resonances. During their formation in the protoplanetary disk, interactions between the giant planets and the gas disk caused them to migrate inward toward the Sun. Jupiter's inward migration continued until it was halted, or reversed, as in the [[Grand tack hypothesis|Grand Tack]] model, when it captured a faster migrating Saturn in a mean-motion resonance.&lt;ref name=Masset_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Masset|first=F.|author2=Snellgrove, M.|title=Reversing type II migration: resonance trapping of a lighter giant protoplanet|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|date=2001|volume=320|issue=4|pages=L55–L59|doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04159.x|arxiv=astro-ph/0003421|bibcode = 2001MNRAS.320L..55M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resonance chain was extended as the three ice giants also migrated inward and were captured in further resonances.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_Morbidelli_2012" /&gt; A long-range migration of Neptune outward into the planetesimal disk before planetary encounters begins is most likely if the planets were captured in a 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 resonance chain, occurring in 65% of simulations when the inner edge was within 2 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]. While this resonance chain has the highest likelihood of reproducing Neptune's migration other resonance chains are also possible if the instability occurred early.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt;

A late instability may have followed an extended period of slow dust-driven migration. The combination of a late escape from a resonance chain, as described in the [[Nice 2 model]], and a long-range migration of Neptune is unlikely. If the inner edge of the planetesimal disk is close an early escape from resonance occurs, if it is distant an instability typically triggered before a significant migration of Neptune occurs. This gap may be bridged if an early escape from resonance is followed by an extended period of slow dust-driven migration. Resonance chains other than the 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 are unlikely in this case. Instabilities occur during the slow migration for tighter resonance chains and the distant disk is unrealistically narrow for more relaxed resonance chains. The rate of dust-driven migration slows with time as the rate of dust generation declines. As a result, the timing of the instability is sensitive to factors that determine the rate of dust generation such as the size distribution and the strength of the planetesimals.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deienno|first1=Rogerio|last2=Morbidelli|first2=Alessandro|last3=Gomes|first3=Rodney S.|last4=Nesvorny|first4=David|title=Constraining the giant planets' initial configuration from their evolution: implications for the timing of the planetary instability|date=2017|arxiv=1702.02094|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aa5eaa|volume=153|issue=4|journal=The Astronomical Journal|page=153|bibcode = 2017AJ....153..153D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timing of the instability===

The timing of the instability in the Nice model was initially proposed to have coincided with the Late Heavy Bombardment, a spike in the impact rate thought to have occurred several million years after the formation of the Solar System. However, recently a number of issues have been raised regarding the timing of the Nice model instability, whether it was the cause of the Late Heavy Bombardment, and if an alternative would better explain the associated craters and impact basins. Most of the effects of the Nice model instability on the orbits of the giant planets and those of the various small body populations from the asteroid belt outward to the scattered disk are independent of its timing, however.

A five-planet Nice model with a late instability has a low probability of reproducing the orbits of the terrestrial planets. Jupiter's and Saturn's period ratio makes the required jump in a small fraction of simulations (7%–8.7%)&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_Morbidelli_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaib_Chambers_2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaib|first1=Nathan A.|last2=Chambers|first2=John E.|title=The fragility of the terrestrial planets during a giant-planet instability|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=2016|volume=455|issue=4|pages=3561–3569|doi=10.1093/mnras/stv2554|url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/455/4/3561|bibcode = 2016MNRAS.455.3561K |arxiv = 1510.08448}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets can also be excited when Jupiter encounters the ice giant.&lt;ref name="Agnor_Lin_2012" /&gt; In a study by Nathan Kaib and John Chambers this resulted in the orbits of the terrestrial planets being reproduced in a few percent of simulation with only 1% reproducing both the terrestrial and giant planets orbits. This led Kaib and Chambers to propose that the instability occurred early, before the formation of the terrestrial planets.&lt;ref name="Kaib_Chambers_2016" /&gt; However, a jump in the ratio of the orbital periods of Jupiter and Saturn is still required to reproduce the asteroid belt, reducing the advantage of an early instability.&lt;ref name="Walsh_Morbidelli_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walsh|first1=K.

Sufficient mass may not remain in the planetesimal disk after 400 million years of collisional grinding to fit models of the instability. If the size distribution of the planetesimal disk initially resembled its current distribution and included 1000's of Pluto mass objects significant mass loss occurs. This leaves the disk with under 10 Earth masses, while a minimum of 15 Earth masses is needed in current models of the instability. The size distribution also becomes shallower than is observed. These problems remain even if simulations begin with a more massive disk or a steeper size distribution. In contrast, a much lower mass loss and little change in the size distribution occurs during a early instability.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_etal_2018a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nesvorny|first1=David|last2=Parker|first2=Joel|last3=Vokrouhlicky|first3=David|title=Bi-lobed Shape of Comet 67P from a Collapsed Binary|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=2018|volume=155|issue=6|page=246|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aac01f|arxiv=1804.08735|bibcode=2018AJ....155..246N}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the planetesimal disk began without Pluto mass objects collisional grinding would begin as they formed from smaller object, with the timing depending on the initial size of the objects and mass of the planetesimal disk.&lt;ref name="Kenyon_Bromley_2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenyon|first1=Scott J.|last2=Bromley|first2=Benjamin C.|title=Coagulation Calculations of Icy Planet Formation at 15-150 AU: A Correlation between the Maximum Radius and the Slope of the Size Distribution for Trans-Neptunian Objects|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=2012|volume=143|issue=3|page=63|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/143/3/63|arxiv=1201.4395|bibcode=2012AJ....143...63K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binary objects such as [[617 Patroclus|Patroclus]]-Menoetius would be separated due to the collisions if the instability was late. Patroclus and Menoetius are a pair of ~100 km objects orbiting with a separation of 680 km and relative velocities of ~11 m/s. While this binary remains in a massive planetesimal disk it is vulnerable to being separated due to collision. Roughly ~90% of similar binaries are separated per hundred million years in simulations and after 400 million years its survival probabilities falls to 7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;. The presence of Patroclus-Menoetius among the Jupiter Trojans requires that the giant planet instability occurred within 100 million years of the formation of the Solar System.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_etal_2018b"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nesvorný |first1=David |last2=Vokrouhlický |first2=David |last3=Bottke |first3=William F. |last4=Levison |first4=Harold F. |title=Evidence for very early migration of the Solar System planets from the Patroclus–Menoetius binary Jupiter Trojan |journal=Nature Astronomy |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=878–882 |date=2018 |doi=10.1038/s41550-018-0564-3 |arxiv=1809.04007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bombardment produced by the Nice model may not match the Late Heavy Bombardment.

==Proposed names==
According to Nesvorný, colleagues have suggested several names for the hypothetical fifth giant planet—[[Hades]], after the Greek god of the underworld; [[Liber]], after the Roman god of wine and a cognate of [[Dionysus]] and [[Bacchus]]; and [[Mefitis|Mephitis]], after the Roman goddess of toxic gases. Another suggestion is "Thing 1" from Dr. Seuss's ''[[Cat in the Hat]]'' children's book.&lt;ref&gt;A New Name for an Old Planet: ''New Scientist'': 01.10.2011: 15, https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20952-missing-planet-explains-solar-systems-structure/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes on Planet Nine==
In January 2016, Batygin and Brown proposed that a distant massive [[Planet Nine|ninth planet]] is responsible for the alignment of the perihelia of several trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axes greater than 250 AU.&lt;ref name="TAJ201601" /&gt; Although the mechanism for the ejection of the fifth giant planet in the five-planet Nice model is reminiscent of the origin of Planet Nine, with a gravitational instability including an encounter with Jupiter, it is unlikely to be the same planet. The estimated timing of the capture of Planet Nine onto its distant orbit, three to ten million years after the formation of the Solar System, when the Sun was still in its [[open cluster|birth cluster]], is inconsistent with a giant-planet instability that was responsible for the Late Heavy Bombardment.&lt;ref name="Drake_2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drake|first1=Nadia|title=How can we find planet nine?

The green [[vortex generator]]s prompt the transition to [[turbulent flow]] and prevent back-flow also called [[flow separation]] from the high-pressure region in the back. The surface in front is as smooth as possible or even employs [[Dermal denticle|shark-like skin]], as any turbulence here increases the energy of the airflow. The truncation on the right, known as a [[Kammback]], also prevents backflow from the high-pressure region in the back across the [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoiler]]s to the convergent part.]]

In [[physics]] and [[engineering]], '''fluid dynamics'''  is a subdiscipline of [[fluid mechanics]] that describes the flow of [[fluid]]s—[[liquid]]s and [[gas]]es.  It has several subdisciplines, including [[aerodynamics]] (the study of air and other gases in motion) and '''hydrodynamics''' (the study of liquids in motion).  Fluid dynamics has a wide range of applications, including calculating [[force]]s and [[moment (physics)|moment]]s on [[aircraft]], determining the [[mass flow rate]] of [[petroleum]] through [[pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[weather forecasting|predicting weather pattern]]s, understanding [[nebula]]e in [[interstellar space]] and [[Nuclear weapon design|modelling fission weapon detonation]],

Fluid dynamics offers a systematic structure—which underlies these [[practical disciplines]]—that embraces empirical and semi-empirical laws derived from [[flow measurement]] and used to solve practical problems. The solution to a fluid dynamics problem typically involves the calculation of various properties of the fluid, such as [[flow velocity]], [[pressure]], [[density]], and [[temperature]], as functions of space and time.

Before the twentieth century, ''hydrodynamics'' was synonymous with fluid dynamics.  This is still reflected in names of some fluid dynamics topics, like [[magnetohydrodynamics]] and [[hydrodynamic stability]], both of which can also be applied to gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=The Dawn of Fluid Dynamics: A Discipline Between Science and Technology | first=Michael | last=Eckert | publisher=Wiley | year=2006 | isbn=3-527-40513-5 | page=ix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Equations of fluid dynamics==
The foundational axioms of fluid dynamics are the [[Conservation law (physics)|conservation law]]s, specifically, [[conservation of mass]],  [[conservation of momentum|conservation of linear momentum]] (also known as [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second Law of Motion]]), and [[conservation of energy]] (also known as [[First Law of Thermodynamics]]). These are based on [[classical mechanics]] and are modified in [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]].  They are expressed using the [[Reynolds transport theorem]].

In addition to the above, fluids are assumed to obey the '''{{vanchor|continuum assumption}}'''. Fluids are composed of molecules that collide with one another and solid objects. However, the continuum assumption assumes that fluids are continuous, rather than discrete. Consequently, it is assumed that properties such as density, pressure, temperature, and flow velocity are well-defined at [[infinitesimal]]ly small points in space and vary continuously from one point to another. The fact that the fluid is made up of discrete molecules is ignored.

For fluids that are sufficiently dense to be a continuum, do not contain ionized species, and have flow velocities small in relation to the speed of light, the momentum equations for [[Newtonian fluid]]s are the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]—which is a [[non-linear]] set of [[differential equations]] that describes the flow of a fluid whose stress depends linearly on flow velocity gradients and pressure. The unsimplified equations do not have a general [[Solution in closed form|closed-form solution]], so they are primarily of use in [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]].  The equations can be simplified in a number of ways, all of which make them easier to solve.  Some of the simplifications allow some simple fluid dynamics problems to be solved in closed form.{{citation needed|date= May 2014}}

In addition to the mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations, a [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] equation of state that gives the pressure as a function of other thermodynamic variables is required to completely describe the problem. An example of this would be the [[Ideal gas law|perfect gas equation of state]]:

:&lt;math&gt;p= \frac{\rho R_u T}{M}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is pressure, ρ is density, ''T'' the absolute temperature, while ''R&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[gas constant]] and ''M'' is [[molar mass]] for a particular gas.

===Conservation laws===
Three conservation laws are used to solve fluid dynamics problems, and may be written in [[integral]] or [[Differential (infinitesimal)|differential]] form. The conservation laws may be applied to a region of the flow called a ''control volume''.  A control volume is a discrete volume in space through which fluid is assumed to flow.  The integral formulations of the conservation laws are used to describe the change of mass, momentum, or energy within the control volume.  Differential formulations of the conservation laws apply [[Stokes' theorem]] to yield an expression which may be interpreted as the integral form of the law applied to an infinitesimally small volume (at a point) within the flow.

*[[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|Mass continuity]] (conservation of mass): The rate of change of fluid mass inside a control volume must be equal to the net rate of fluid flow into the volume.  Physically, this statement requires that mass is neither created nor destroyed in the control volume,&lt;ref name="J.D. Anderson 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=J. D. |title=Fundamentals of Aerodynamics |location=London |edition=4th |publisher=McGraw–Hill |year=2007 |isbn=0-07-125408-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be translated into the integral form of the continuity equation:
::&lt;math&gt;{\partial \over \partial t} \iiint_V \rho \, dV = - \, {} &lt;/math&gt; {{oiint|preintegral = |intsubscpt =&lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle S}&lt;/math&gt;|integrand = &lt;math&gt;{}\,\rho\mathbf{u}\cdot d\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;}}

:Above, &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid density, '''u''' is the [[flow velocity]] vector, and ''t'' is time.  The left-hand side of the above expression is the rate of increase of mass within the volume and contains a triple integral over the control volume, whereas the right-hand side contains an integration over the surface of the control volume of mass convected into the system.  Mass flow into the system is accounted as positive, and since the normal vector to the surface is opposite the sense of flow into the system the term is negated. The differential form of the continuity equation is, by the [[divergence theorem]]:

::&lt;math&gt;\ {\partial \rho \over \partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
*[[Momentum|Conservation of momentum]]: [[Newton's second law of motion]] applied to a control volume, is a statement that any change in momentum of the fluid within that control volume will be due to the net flow of momentum into the volume and the action of external forces acting on the fluid within the volume.

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \iiint_{\scriptstyle V} \rho\mathbf{u} \, dV = -\, {} &lt;/math&gt; {{oiint|preintegral = |intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;_{\scriptstyle S}&lt;/math&gt; |integrand}} &lt;math&gt; (\rho\mathbf{u}\cdot d\mathbf{S}) \mathbf{u} -{}&lt;/math&gt; {{oiint|intsubscpt = &lt;math&gt;{\scriptstyle S}&lt;/math&gt;|integrand = &lt;math&gt; {}\, p \, d\mathbf{S}&lt;/math&gt;}} &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{}+ \iiint_{\scriptstyle V} \rho \mathbf{f}_\text{body} \, dV + \mathbf{F}_\text{surf}&lt;/math&gt;

:In the above integral formulation of this equation, the term on the left is the net change of momentum within the volume. The first term on the right is the net rate at which momentum is convected into the volume. The second term on the right is the force due to pressure on the volume's surfaces. The first two terms on the right are negated since momentum entering the system is accounted as positive, and the normal is opposite the direction of the velocity &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt; and pressure forces. The third term on the right is the net acceleration of the mass within the volume due to any [[body force]]s (here represented by ''f''&lt;sub&gt;body&lt;/sub&gt;). [[Surface force]]s, such as viscous forces, are represented by '''&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_\text{surf}&lt;/math&gt;''', the net force due to [[Stress (mechanics)|shear forces]] acting on the  volume surface. The momentum balance can also be written for a ''moving'' control volume.&lt;ref&gt;

:The following is the differential form of the momentum conservation equation.  Here, the volume is reduced to an infinitesimally small point, and both surface and body forces are accounted for in one total force, ''F''.  For example, ''F'' may be expanded into an expression for the frictional and gravitational forces acting at a point in a flow.

:In aerodynamics, air is assumed to be a [[Newtonian fluid]], which posits a linear relationship between the shear stress (due to internal friction forces) and the rate of strain of the fluid.

The conservation of momentum equations for the compressible, viscous flow case are called the Navier–Stokes equations.&lt;ref name="J.D. Anderson 2007"/&gt;

===Compressible vs incompressible flow===
All fluids are [[compressibility|compressible]] to some extent; that is, changes in pressure or temperature cause changes in density. However, in many situations the changes in pressure and temperature are sufficiently small that the changes in density are negligible. In this case the flow can be modelled as an [[incompressible flow]]. Otherwise the more general [[compressible flow]] equations must be used.

Mathematically, incompressibility is expressed by saying that the density ρ of a [[fluid parcel]] does not change as it moves in the flow field, i.e.,
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{D} \rho}{\mathrm{D}t} = 0 \, ,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''D''/''Dt'' is the [[material derivative]], which is the sum of [[time derivative|local]] and [[convective derivative]]s. This additional constraint simplifies the governing equations, especially in the case when the fluid has a uniform density.

For flow of gases, to determine whether to use compressible or incompressible fluid dynamics, the [[Mach number]] of the flow is evaluated. As a rough guide, compressible effects can be ignored at Mach numbers below approximately 0.3.  For liquids, whether the incompressible assumption is valid depends on the fluid properties (specifically the critical pressure and temperature of the fluid) and the flow conditions (how close to the critical pressure the actual flow pressure becomes).  [[acoustics|Acoustic]] problems always require allowing compressibility, since [[sound waves]] are compression waves involving changes in pressure and density of the medium through which they propagate.

===Newtonian vs non-Newtonian fluids===
[[File:Flow around a wing.gif|thumb|Flow around an [[airfoil]]]]

All fluids are viscous, meaning that they exert some resistance to deformation: neighbouring parcels of fluid moving at different velocities exert viscous forces on each other. The velocity gradient is referred to as a [[strain (materials science)|strain rate]]; it has dimensions &lt;math&gt;T^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. [[Isaac Newton]] showed that for many familiar fluids such as [[water]] and [[Earth's atmosphere|air]], the [[stress (physics)|stress]] due to these viscous forces is linearly related to the strain rate. Such fluids are called [[Newtonian fluids]]. The coefficient of proportionality is called the fluid's viscosity; for Newtonian fluids, it is a fluid property that is independent of the strain rate.

[[Non-Newtonian fluid]]s have a more complicated, non-linear stress-strain behaviour. The sub-discipline of [[rheology]] describes the stress-strain behaviours of such fluids, which include [[emulsion]]s and [[slurries]], some [[viscoelasticity|viscoelastic]] materials such as [[blood]] and some [[polymer]]s, and ''sticky liquids'' such as [[latex]], [[honey]] and [[lubricants]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Inviscid vs viscous vs Stokes flow===

The dynamic of fluid parcels is described with the help of [[Newton's second law]]. An accelerating parcel of fluid is subject to inertial effects.

The [[Reynolds number]] is a [[dimensionless quantity]] which characterises the magnitude of inertial effects compared to the magnitude of viscous effects. A low Reynolds number (''Re''&lt;&lt;1) indicates that viscous forces are very strong compared to inertial forces. In such cases, inertial forces are sometimes neglected; this flow regime is called [[Stokes flow|Stokes or creeping flow]].

In contrast, high Reynolds numbers (''Re''&gt;&gt;1) indicate that the inertial effects have more effect on the velocity field than the viscous (friction) effects. In high Reynolds number flows, the flow is often modeled as an [[inviscid flow]], an approximation in which viscosity is completely neglected. Eliminating viscosity allows the [[Navier–Stokes equations]] to be simplified into the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]]. The integration of the Euler equations along a streamline in an inviscid flow yields [[Bernoulli's equation]]. When, in addition to being inviscid, the flow is [[Lamellar field|irrotational]] everywhere, Bernoulli's equation can completely describe the flow everywhere. Such flows are called [[potential flow]]s, because the velocity field may be expressed as the [[gradient]] of a potential energy expression.

This idea can work fairly well when the Reynolds number is high. However, problems such as those involving solid boundaries may require that the viscosity be included. Viscosity cannot be neglected near solid boundaries because the [[no-slip condition]] generates a thin region of large strain rate, the [[boundary layer]], in which [[viscosity]] effects dominate and which thus generates [[vorticity]]. Therefore, to calculate net forces on bodies (such as wings), viscous flow equations must be used: inviscid flow theory fails to predict [[Drag (physics)|drag forces]], a limitation known as the [[d'Alembert's paradox]].

A commonly used{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} model, especially in [[computational fluid dynamics]], is to use two flow models: the Euler equations away from the body, and [[boundary layer]] equations in a region close to the body. The two solutions can then be matched with each other, using the [[method of matched asymptotic expansions]].

==={{Anchor|Steady vs unsteady flow}} Steady vs unsteady flow===&lt;!-- [[Steady flow]] redirects here --&gt;

[[File:HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif|thumb|320px|Hydrodynamics simulation of the [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]] &lt;ref&gt;Shengtai Li, Hui Li "Parallel AMR Code for Compressible MHD or HD Equations" (Los Alamos National Laboratory) [http://math.lanl.gov/Research/Highlights/amrmhd.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
A flow that is not a function of time is called '''steady flow'''. Steady-state flow refers to the condition where the fluid properties at a point in the system do not change over time. Time dependent flow is known as unsteady (also called transient&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/main/118306-transient-state-unsteady-state.html Transient state or unsteady state?]&lt;/ref&gt;). Whether a particular flow is steady or unsteady, can depend on the chosen frame of reference. For instance, laminar flow over a [[sphere]] is steady in the frame of reference that is stationary with respect to the sphere. In a frame of reference that is stationary with respect to a background flow, the flow is unsteady.

[[Turbulence|Turbulent]] flows are unsteady by definition. A turbulent flow can, however, be [[stationary process|statistically stationary]].  According to Pope:&lt;ref&gt;See Pope (2000), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
The random field ''U''(''x'',''t'') is statistically stationary if all statistics are invariant under a shift in time.
}}
This roughly means that all statistical properties are constant in time. Often, the mean [[Field (physics)|field]] is the object of interest, and this is constant too in a statistically stationary flow.

Steady flows are often more tractable than otherwise similar unsteady flows. The governing equations of a steady problem have one dimension fewer (time) than the governing equations of the same problem without taking advantage of the steadiness of the flow field.

===Laminar vs turbulent flow===
Turbulence is flow characterized by recirculation, [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]], and apparent [[random]]ness.  Flow in which turbulence is not exhibited is called [[laminar flow|laminar]]. The presence of eddies or recirculation alone does not necessarily indicate turbulent flow—these phenomena may be present in laminar flow as well.  Mathematically, turbulent flow is often represented via a [[Reynolds decomposition]], in which the flow is broken down into the sum of an [[average]] component and a perturbation component.

It is believed that turbulent flows can be described well through the use of the [[Navier–Stokes equations]]. [[Direct numerical simulation]] (DNS), based on the Navier–Stokes equations, makes it possible to simulate turbulent flows at moderate Reynolds numbers. Restrictions depend on the power of the computer used and the efficiency of the solution algorithm. The results of DNS have been found to agree well with experimental data for some flows.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Schlatter et al, Phys. Fluids 21, 051702 (2009); {{doi|10.1063/1.3139294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most flows of interest have Reynolds numbers much too high for DNS to be a viable option,&lt;ref&gt;See Pope (2000), p. 344.&lt;/ref&gt; given the state of computational power for the next few decades.  Any flight vehicle large enough to carry a human (L &gt; 3 m), moving faster than  20&amp;nbsp;m/s (72&amp;nbsp;km/h) is well beyond the limit of DNS simulation (Re = 4 million).  Transport aircraft wings (such as on an [[Airbus A300]] or [[Boeing 747]]) have Reynolds numbers of 40 million (based on the wing chord dimension).  Solving these real-life flow problems requires turbulence models for the foreseeable future. [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations]] (RANS) combined with [[turbulence modelling]] provides a model of the effects of the turbulent flow. Such a modelling mainly provides the additional momentum transfer by the [[Reynolds stresses]], although the turbulence also enhances the [[heat transfer|heat]] and [[mass transfer]]. Another promising methodology is [[large eddy simulation]] (LES), especially in the guise of [[detached eddy simulation]] (DES)—which is a combination of RANS turbulence modelling and large eddy simulation.

===Subsonic vs transonic, supersonic and hypersonic flows===
While many flows (e.g. flow of water through a pipe) occur at low [[Mach number]]s, many flows of practical interest in aerodynamics or in [[Turbomachinery|turbomachines]] occur at high fractions of M=1 ([[Transonic|transonic flows]]) or in excess of it ([[Supersonic speed|supersonic]] or even [[Hypersonic speed|hypersonic flows]]). New phenomena occur at these regimes such as instabilities in transonic flow, shock waves for supersonic flow, or non-equilibrium chemical behaviour due to ionization in hypersonic flows. In practice, each of those flow regimes is treated separately.

===Reactive vs non-reactive flows===
Reactive flows are flows that are chemically reactive, which finds its applications in many areas such as [[combustion]]([[Internal Combustion Engine|IC engine]]), [[propulsion]] devices ([[Rockets]], [[jet engines]] etc.), [[detonations]], fire and safety hazards, astrophysics etc. In addition to conservation of mass, momentum and energy, conservation of individual species (for example, mass fraction of [[methane]] in methane combustion) need to be derived, where the production/depletion rate of any species are obtained by simultaneously solving the equations of [[chemical kinetics]].

===Magnetohydrodynamics===
{{main|Magnetohydrodynamics}}
[[Magnetohydrodynamics]] is the multi-disciplinary study of the flow of [[electrical conduction|electrically conducting]] fluids in [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] fields. Examples of such fluids include [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]s, liquid metals, and [[Saline water|salt water]]. The fluid flow equations are solved simultaneously with [[Maxwell's equations]] of electromagnetism.

===Relativistic fluid dynamics===
Relativistic fluid dynamics studies the macroscopic and microscopic fluid motion at large velocities comparable to the [[velocity of light]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Landau |first=Lev Davidovich |first2=Evgenii Mikhailovich |last2=Lifshitz |title=Fluid Mechanics |location=London |publisher=Pergamon |year=1987 |isbn=0-08-033933-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This branch of fluid dynamics accounts the relativistic effects both from the [[special theory of relativity]] and the [[general theory of relativity]]. The governing equations are derived in [[Riemannian geometry]] for [[Minkowski spacetime]].

===Other approximations===
There are a large number of other possible approximations to fluid dynamic problems. Some of the more commonly used are listed below.
* The ''[[Boussinesq approximation (buoyancy)|Boussinesq approximation]]'' neglects variations in density except to calculate [[buoyancy]] forces. It is often used in free [[convection]] problems where density changes are small.
* ''[[Lubrication theory]]'' and ''[[Hele–Shaw flow]]'' exploits the large [[aspect ratio]] of the domain to show that certain terms in the equations are small and so can be neglected.
* ''[[Slender-body theory]]'' is a methodology used in [[Stokes flow]] problems to estimate the force on, or flow field around, a long slender object in a viscous fluid.
* The ''[[shallow-water equations]]'' can be used to describe a layer of relatively inviscid fluid with a [[free surface]], in which surface [[slope|gradients]] are small.
* ''[[Darcy's law]]'' is used for flow in [[porous medium|porous media]], and works with variables averaged over several pore-widths.
* In rotating systems, the ''[[quasi-geostrophic equations]]'' assume an almost [[Balanced flow#Geostrophic flow|perfect balance]] between [[pressure gradient]]s and the [[Coriolis force]]. It is useful in the study of [[atmospheric dynamics]].

== Terminology in fluid dynamics ==
The concept of pressure is central to the study of both fluid statics and fluid dynamics.  A pressure can be identified for every point in a body of fluid, regardless of whether the fluid is in motion or not.  Pressure can be [[Pressure measurement|measured]] using an aneroid, Bourdon tube, mercury column, or various other methods.

Some of the terminology that is necessary in the study of fluid dynamics is not found in other similar areas of study.  In particular, some of the terminology used in fluid dynamics is not used in [[fluid statics]].

=== Terminology in incompressible fluid dynamics ===
The concepts of total pressure and [[dynamic pressure]] arise from [[Bernoulli's equation]] and are significant in the study of all fluid flows.  (These two pressures are not pressures in the usual sense—they cannot be measured using an aneroid, Bourdon tube or mercury column.)  To avoid potential ambiguity when referring to pressure in fluid dynamics, many authors use the term [[static pressure]] to distinguish it from total pressure and dynamic pressure.  [[Static pressure]] is identical to pressure and can be identified for every point in a fluid flow field.

A point in a fluid flow where the flow has come to rest (i.e. speed is equal to zero adjacent to some solid body immersed in the fluid flow) is of special significance.  It is of such importance that it is given a special name—a [[stagnation point]].  The static pressure at the stagnation point is of special significance and is given its own name—[[stagnation pressure]].  In incompressible flows, the stagnation pressure at a stagnation point is equal to the total pressure throughout the flow field.

=== Terminology in compressible fluid dynamics ===
In a compressible fluid, it is convenient to define the total conditions (also called stagnation conditions) for all thermodynamic state properties (e.g. total temperature, total enthalpy, total speed of sound).  These total flow conditions are a function of the fluid velocity and have different values in frames of reference with different motion.

To avoid potential ambiguity when referring to the properties of the fluid associated with the state of the fluid rather than its motion, the prefix "static" is commonly used (e.g. static temperature, static enthalpy).  Where there is no prefix, the fluid property is the static condition (i.e. "density" and "static density" mean the same thing).  The static conditions are independent of the frame of reference.

Because the total flow conditions are defined by [[isentropic]]ally bringing the fluid to rest, there is no need to distinguish between total entropy and static entropy as they are always equal by definition.  As such, entropy is most commonly referred to as simply "entropy".

'''Foot binding''' was the custom of applying tight binding to the feet of young girls to modify the shape and size of their feet. It was practised in China from the [[Song dynasty]] until the early 20th century, and bound feet were considered a status symbol as well as a mark of beauty. Foot binding limited the mobility of women, and resulted in lifelong disabilities for most of its subjects, although some women with bound feet working outdoors have also been reported. Feet altered by binding were called '''lotus feet'''.

The practice possibly originated among upper class court dancers during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]] in 10th century China, then became popular among the elite during the [[Song dynasty]], eventually spreading to all social classes by the [[Qing dynasty]]. Foot binding was practiced in different forms, and the more severe form of binding may have been developed in the 16th century. It has been estimated that by the 19th century, 40–50% of all Chinese women may have had bound feet, and up to almost 100% among upper class Chinese women.&lt;ref name="lim" &gt;{{cite web |last=Lim |first=Louisa |title=Painful Memories for China's Footbinding Survivors |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=8966942 |work=Morning Edition |publisher=National Public Radio |date=19 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence and practice of foot binding however varied in different parts of the country.

There had been attempts to end the practice during the Qing dynasty; Manchu [[Kangxi Emperor]] tried to ban foot binding in 1664 but failed.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; In the later part of the 19th century, Chinese reformers challenged the practice but it was not until the early 20th century that foot binding began to die out as a result of anti-foot-binding campaigns.  Only a few elderly Chinese women still survive today with bound feet.&lt;ref name="lim"/&gt;

There are a number of stories about the origin of foot binding before its establishment during the Song dynasty. One of these involves the story of a favorite consort of the [[Southern Qi]] emperor [[Xiao Baojuan]], [[Pan Yunu]] (died 501 AD), who had delicate feet and danced barefoot on a floor decorated with golden lotus flower design. The emperor expressed admiration and said that "lotus springs from her every step!" (步步生蓮), a reference to the Buddhist legend of Padmavati under whose feet lotus springs forth. This story may have given rise to the terms "golden lotus" or "lotus feet" used to describe bound feet; there is, however, no evidence that Consort Pan ever bound her feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=qpNQ91M3BswC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author=Dorothy Ko |pages=32–34 |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0-520-23284-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general view is that the practice is likely to have originated from the time of the 10th-century [[Li Yu (Southern Tang)|Emperor Li Yu]] of the [[Southern Tang]], just before the [[Song dynasty]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/ptop/alabaster/A1155872 |title=Chinese Foot Binding |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Li Yu created a six-foot tall golden lotus decorated with precious stones and pearls, and asked his concubine {{Interlanguage link multi|Yao Niang|zh|3=窅娘}} to bind her feet in white silk into the shape of the crescent moon, and perform a ballet-like dance on the points of her feet on the lotus.&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt; Yao Niang's dance was said to be so graceful that others sought to imitate her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=qpNQ91M3BswC&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author=Dorothy Ko |pages=42 |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0-520-23284-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The binding of feet was then replicated by other upper-class women and the practice spread.&lt;ref name="pitts-taylor"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=66u24WAyO_YC&amp;pg=PA203#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cultural Encyclopedia of the Body |page=203 |editor=Victoria Pitts-Taylor |publisher=Greenwood |date= 2008 |isbn=978-0-313-34145-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest possible references to foot binding appear around 1100, when a couple of poems seemed to allude to the practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/index.php/component/k2/item/10758-han-chinese-footbinding |title=Han Chinese Footbinding |work=Textile Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xu Ji 徐積 《詠蔡家婦》： 「但知勒四支，不知裹两足。」(translation: "knowing about arranging the four limbs, but not about binding her two feet); [[Su Shi]] 蘇軾 《菩薩蠻》：「塗香莫惜蓮承步，長愁羅襪凌波去；只見舞回風，都無行處踪。偷穿宮樣穩，並立雙趺困，纖妙說應難，須從掌上看。」&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ebrey 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xjoLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA38 |title=The Inner Quarters: Marriage and the Lives of Chinese Women in the Sung Period|author= Patricia Buckley  Ebrey|pages=37–39 |isbn= 9780520913486 |publisher=University of California Press |date=1 December 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; Soon after 1148,&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; in the earliest extant discourse on the practice of foot binding, scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Zhang Bangji|zh|3=張邦基}} wrote that a bound foot should be arch-shape and small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |pages=111–115 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wenxian.fanren8.com/08/05/5/8.htm |title=墨庄漫录-宋-张邦基  8-卷八 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that "women's footbinding began in recent times; it was not mentioned in any books from previous eras."&lt;ref name="Morris2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian Morris (historian)|title=Why the West Rules - For Now: The Patterns of History, and What They Reveal About the Future|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qNVrfoSubmIC&amp;pg=PA424 |date=2011|publisher=McClelland &amp; Stewart|isbn=978-1-55199-581-6|page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Che Ruoshui|zh|3=车若水}} wrote the first known criticism of the practice: "Little girls not yet four or five years old, who have done nothing wrong, nevertheless are made to suffer unlimited pain to bind [their feet] small.

The earliest archaeological evidence for foot binding dates to the tombs of Huang Sheng, who died in 1243 at the age of 17, and Madame Zhou, who died in 1274. Each had her feet bound with 6-foot-long gauze strips. Zhou's skeleton was well preserved and showed that her feet fit the narrow, pointed slippers that were buried with her.&lt;ref name="Morris2011"/&gt; The style of bound feet found in Song dynasty tombs, where the big toe was bent upwards, appears to be different from the norm of later eras, and the excessive smallness of the feet, the "three-inch golden lotus", may be a later development in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA191#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |pages=187–191 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KJHUFRTYpA4C&amp;pg=PA24#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Every Step a Lotus: Shoes for Bound Feet|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2002 |pages=21–24 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the Song dynasty, men would drink from a special shoe whose heel contained a small cup. During the [[Yuan dynasty]], some would also drink directly from the shoe itself. This practice was called "toast to the golden lotus" and lasted until the late [[Qing dynasty]].&lt;ref name="shoe"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=2Ifj9h4Z4YQC&amp;pg=PA164#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Art of the Shoe |author= Marie-Josèphe Bossan |page=164 |publisher=Parkstone Press Ltd |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-85995-803-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first European to mention footbinding was the Italian missionary [[Odoric of Pordenone]] in the fourteenth century during the Yuan dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iL2AAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History |first=Patricia|last= Ebrey |page=196|publisher=Routledge |isbn= 9781134442935 |date=2003-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no other foreign visitors to [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] China mentioned the practice, including [[Ibn Battuta]] and [[Marco Polo]] (who nevertheless noted the dainty walk of Chinese women who took very small steps), perhaps an indication that it was not a widespread or extreme practice at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSfvfr8VQSEC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Marco Polo's China: A Venetian in the Realm of Khubilai Khan |first= Stephen G. |last=Haw |pages=55–56 |publisher=Routledge| isbn=9781134275427|date=2006-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The practice however was encouraged by the Mongol rulers on their Chinese subjects.&lt;ref name="pitts-taylor"/&gt; The practice became increasingly common among the gentry families, later spreading to the general population, as commoners and theatre actors alike adopted footbinding. By the [[Ming dynasty|Ming period]], the practice was no longer the preserve of the gentry, but it was considered a status symbol.&lt;ref name="Rosenlee2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee|title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA141|date=1 February 2012|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8179-0|pages=141–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw1_yKwk_XkC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=37 |title=China Chic: East Meets West|author1=Valerie Steele |author2=John S.

[[File:Chaussure chinoise Saverne 02 05 2012 1.jpg|thumb|230px|A lotus shoe for bound feet. The ideal length for a bound foot was 3 Chinese inches (寸), which is around {{convert|4|in|cm|0}} in western measurement.]]

The Manchus issued a number of edicts to ban the practice, first in 1636 when the Manchu leader [[Hong Taiji]] declared the founding of the new Qing dynasty, then in 1638, and another in 1664 by the [[Kangxi Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYgQWAfHjmsC&amp;pg=PA144#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation|author= Li-Hsiang, Lisa Rosenlee |page=144 |publisher= State University of New York Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0-7914-6750-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, few Han Chinese complied with the edicts and Kangxi eventually abandoned the effort in 1668. 
By the 19th century, it was estimated that 40-50% of Chinese women had bound feet, and among upper class Han Chinese women, the figure was almost 100%.&lt;ref name="lim" /&gt; Bound feet became a mark of beauty and was also a prerequisite for finding a husband. It also became an avenue for poorer women to [[Hypergamy|marry into money]] in some areas; for example, in late 19th century Guangdong, it was customary to bind the feet of the eldest daughter of a lower-class family who was intended to be brought up as a lady. Her younger sisters would grow up to be bond-servants or domestic slaves and be able to work in the fields, but the eldest daughter would assume to never have the need to work. Women, their families, and their husbands took great pride in tiny feet, with the ideal length, called the "Golden Lotus", being about three [[Cun (unit)|Chinese inches]] long (around {{convert|4|in|cm|0}} in Western measurement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=8 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Manning|first=Mary Ellen|title=China's "Golden Lotus Feet" - Foot-binding Practice|url=http://travel.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474976997081|accessdate=29 January 2012|date=10 May 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928031927/http://travel.gather.com/viewArticle.action?articleId=281474976997081|archivedate=28 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pride was reflected in the elegantly embroidered silk slippers and wrappings girls and women wore to cover their feet. Walking on bound feet necessitated bending the knees slightly and swaying to maintain proper movement and balance, a dainty walk that was also considered erotic to some men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity |author= Janell L.

Some women with bound feet may not walk without the support of their shoes and were severely limited in their mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NieEnuWegkoC&amp;pg=PA302&amp;lpg=PA302#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Film Review - Footbinding: Search for the Three Inch Golden Lotus |journal=Anthropologica |date=2004 |volume=48|issue=2|first=Laurel |last=Bossen |pages=301–303 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many women with bound feet were still able to walk and work in the fields, albeit with greater limitation than their non-bound counterparts.  In the 19th and early 20th century, dancers with bound feet were popular, as were circus performers who stood on prancing or running horses. Women with bound feet in one village in [[Yunnan]] Province even formed a regional dance troupe to perform for tourists in the late 20th century, though age has since forced the group to retire.&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt; In other areas, women in their 70s and 80s could be found providing limited assistance to the workers in the rice fields well into the 21st century.&lt;ref name="lim" /&gt;

=== Demise ===
Opposition to foot binding had been raised by some Chinese writers in the 18th century. In the mid-19th century, many of the rebel leaders of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] were of Hakka background whose womenfolk did not bind their feet, and foot binding was outlawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYjGN4UM1mMC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;lpg=PA226#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=27–29 |title=The Taiping Ideology: Its Sources, Interpretations, and Influences|author1=Vincent Yu-Chung Shih |author2=Yu-chung Shi |publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1968 |isbn=978-0-295-73957-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UBqr_MEn4m4C&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=For Our Daughters: How Outstanding Women Worldwide Have Balanced Home and Career|author= Olivia Cox-Fill|page=57|publisher=Praeger Publishers |year= 1996|isbn= 978-0-275-95199-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion however failed, and Christian missionaries, who had provided education for girls and actively discouraged what they considered a barbaric practice, then played a part in changing elite opinion on footbinding through education, [[pamphleteering]], and lobbying of the Qing court.&lt;ref name="blake 1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=edwards&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cross-cultural Study of Women: A Comprehensive Guide|author= Mary I.

"  Besides improvements in civil engineering, progress was made in social areas as well. The traditional Chinese practice of foot binding was widespread in Taiwan's early years. Traditional Chinese society perceived women with smaller feet as being more beautiful. Women would bind their feet with long bandages to stunt growth.
Even housemaids were divided into those with bound feet and those without. The former served the daughters of the house, while the latter were assigned heavier work. This practice was later regarded as barbaric. In the early years of the Japanese colonial period, the Foot-binding Liberation Society was established to promote the idea of natural feet, but its influence was limited.
The fact that women suffered higher casualties in the 1906 Meishan quake with 551 men and 700 women dead, and 1,099 men and 1,334 women injured--very different from the situation in Japan--raised public concern. Foot binding was blamed and this gave impetus to the drive to stamp out the practice."&lt;/ref&gt; The practice however lingered on in some regions in China; in 1928, a census in rural [[Shanxi]] found that 18% of women had bound feet,&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125800116737444883  |title=Bound by History: The Last of China's 'Lotus-Feet' Ladies |author= Simon Montlake |date = November 13, 2009 |work=Wall Street Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in some remote rural areas such as [[Yunnan Province]] it continued to be practiced until the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Favazza, Armando R.

Foot binding was practiced in various forms and its prevalence varied in different regions. A less severe form in Sichuan, called "cucumber foot" (''huanggua jiao'') due to its slender shape, folded the four toes under but did not distort the heel and taper the ankle.&lt;ref name=wsj /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=7 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some working women in [[Jiangsu]] made a pretense of binding while keeping their feet natural.&lt;ref name="blake 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=RA1-PA327#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History |author=C Fred Blake|pages=327–329|editor= Bonnie G.

[[Manchu people|Manchu]] women, as well as Mongol and Chinese women in the [[Eight Banners]], did not bind their feet, and the most a Manchu woman might do was to wrap the feet tightly to give them a slender appearance.&lt;ref name="manchu"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=_qtgoTIAiKUC&amp;pg=PA247#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|last=Elliott|first=Mark C.|title=The Manchu Way: the Eight Banners and Ethnic Identity in Late Imperial China|year=2001|publisher=Stanford University Press|location=Stanford, CA|isbn=978-0-8047-3606-0|pages=246–249}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Manchus, wanting to emulate the particular gait that bound feet necessitated, adapted their own form of platform shoes to cause them to walk in a similar swaying manner. These "flower bowl" (花盆鞋) or "horse-hoof" shoes (馬蹄鞋) have a platform generally made of wood two to six inches in height and fitted to the middle of the sole, or they have a small central tapered pedestal. Many Han Chinese in the Inner City of Beijing also did not bind their feet, and it was reported in the mid-1800s that around 50-60% of non-banner women had unbound feet. Bound feet nevertheless became a significant differentiating marker between Han women and Manchu or other banner women.&lt;ref name="manchu" /&gt;

}}

The process was started before the arch of the foot had a chance to develop fully, usually between the ages of 4 and 9. Binding usually started during the winter months since the feet were more likely to be numb, and therefore the pain would not be as extreme.&lt;ref name="slippers"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Beverley|title=Splendid Slippers: A Thousand Years of an Erotic Tradition |publisher=Ten Speed Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-89815-957-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First, each foot would be soaked in a warm mixture of herbs and animal blood; this was intended to soften the foot and aid the binding. Then, the toenails were cut back as far as possible to prevent in-growth and subsequent infections, since the toes were to be pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. Cotton bandages, 3&amp;nbsp;m long and 5&amp;nbsp;cm wide (10&amp;nbsp;ft by 2 in), were prepared by soaking them in the blood and herb mixture. To enable the size of the feet to be reduced, the toes on each foot were curled under, then pressed with great force downwards and squeezed into the sole of the foot until the toes broke.

The broken toes were held tightly against the sole of the foot while the foot was then drawn down straight with the leg and the arch of the foot was forcibly broken. The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of the foot at the instep, then carried over the toes, under the foot, and around the heel, the freshly broken toes being pressed tightly into the sole of the foot. At each pass around the foot, the binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of the foot and the heel together, causing the broken foot to fold at the arch, and pressing the toes underneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the girl could not move her toes at all and the ends of the binding cloth were then sewn so that the girl could not loosen it.
[[File:Bound feet (X-ray).jpg|thumb|An X-ray of two bound feet]]
[[File:FootBindingRxSchema2.gif|thumb|Schema of an x-ray comparison between an unbound and bound foot]]

The girl's broken feet required a great deal of care and attention, and they would be unbound regularly. Each time the feet were unbound, they were washed, the toes carefully checked for injury, and the nails carefully and meticulously trimmed. When unbound, the broken feet were also kneaded to soften them and the soles of the girl's feet were often beaten to make the joints and broken bones more flexible. The feet were also soaked in a concoction that caused any necrotic flesh to fall off.&lt;ref name=Levy /&gt;

Immediately after this procedure, the girl's broken toes were folded back under and the feet were rebound. The bindings were pulled even tighter each time the girl's feet were rebound. This unbinding and rebinding ritual was repeated as often as possible (for the rich at least once daily, for poor peasants two or three times a week), with fresh bindings. It was generally an elder female member of the girl's family or a professional foot binder who carried out the initial breaking and ongoing binding of the feet. It was considered preferable to have someone other than the mother do it, as she might have been sympathetic to her daughter's pain and less willing to keep the bindings tight.&lt;ref name=slippers /&gt;

For most the bound feet eventually became numb.  However, once a foot had been crushed and bound, attempting to reverse the process by unbinding was painful,&lt;ref name=body&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s0122BsqrZwC&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Encyclopedia of Body Adornment|author= Margo DeMello |pages=116–117 |publisher=Greenwood Press |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0-313-33695-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the shape could not be reversed without a woman undergoing the same pain all over again.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;

=== Health issues ===
The most common problem with bound feet was infection. Despite the amount of care taken in regularly trimming the toenails, they would often in-grow, becoming infected and causing injuries to the toes. Sometimes, for this reason, the girl's toenails would be peeled back and removed altogether. The tightness of the binding meant that the circulation in the feet was faulty, and the circulation to the toes was almost cut off, so any injuries to the toes were unlikely to heal and were likely to gradually worsen and lead to infected toes and rotting flesh. The necrosis of the flesh would also initially give off a foul odor, and later the smell may come from various microorganisms that colonized the folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/21/china.gender |title= The ties that bind |first=Fraser|last= Newham|date= 21 March 2005 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the infection in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; however, this was seen as a benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between her toes to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ac2UAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA423#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=

At the beginning of the binding, many of the foot bones would remain broken, often for years. However, as the girl grew older, the bones would begin to heal. Even after the foot bones had healed, they were prone to re-breaking repeatedly, especially when the girl was in her teenage years and her feet were still soft. Bones in the girls' feet would often be deliberately broken again in order to further change the size or shape of the feet. This was especially the case with the toes, as small toes were especially desirable.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} Older women were more likely to break hips and other bones in falls, since they could not balance securely on their feet, and were less able to rise to their feet from a sitting position.&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, S. &amp; Stone, K.

== Views and interpretations ==

===Beauty and erotic appeal===
[[File:Woman with bound feet reclining on chaise lounge, China LCCN2001705601.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Bound feet were considered by some to be highly appealing]]
Before footbinding was practiced in China, admiration for small feet already existed as demonstrated by the [[Tang dynasty]] tale of [[Ye Xian]] written around 850 by [[Duan Chengshi]]. This tale of a girl who lost her shoe and then married a king who sought the owner of the shoe as only her foot was small enough to fit the shoe contains elements of the European story of [[Cinderella]], and is thought to be one of its antecedents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jruLAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA77#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding: A Jungian Engagement with Chinese Culture and Psychology |author= Shirley See Yan Ma |pages=75&amp;ndash;78 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd |date=4 December 2009 |isbn=9781135190071 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/files/articles/25ii/10_25.2.pdf |title=Asian Origins of Cinderella: The Zhuang Storyteller of Guangxi |journal=Oral Tradition|volume=25|number=2 |first=Fay |last=Beauchamp |pages=447–496 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For many, the bound feet were an enhancement to a woman's beauty and made her movement more dainty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ebrey|first=Patricia Buckley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vr81YoYK0c4C&amp;pg=PA160 |title='Cambridge Illustrated History of China|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|pages=160–161|edition=2nd|isbn=9780521124331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a woman with perfect lotus feet was likely to make a more prestigious marriage. The desirability varies with the size of the feet &amp;ndash; the perfect bound feet and the most desirable (called "golden lotuses") would be around 3 Chinese inches (around 4 inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm) in Western measurement) or smaller, while those larger may be called "silver lotuses" (4 Chinese inches) or "iron lotuses" (5 Chinese inches or larger and the least desirable for marriage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbJ3DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59 |title=The Aesthetics of Dress |first= Ian |last=King |page=59 |isbn=9783319543222 |publisher=Springer|date=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that footbinding made women more desirable to men is widely used as an explanation for the spread and persistence of footbinding.&lt;ref name="hill 1"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |page=56 |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some also considered bound feet to be intensely erotic, and Qing Dynasty sex manuals listed 48 different ways of playing with women's bound feet. Some men preferred never to see a woman's bound feet, so they were always concealed within tiny "lotus shoes" and wrappings.  According to [[Robert van Gulik]], the bound feet were also considered the most intimate part of a woman's body; in erotic art of the Qing to Song periods where the genitalia may be shown, the bound feet were never depicted uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=85M3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA218#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Sexual life in ancient China:A Preliminary Survey of Chinese Sex and Society from Ca. 1500 B.C.

An erotic effect of the bound feet was the lotus gait, the tiny steps and swaying walk of a woman whose feet had been bound. Women with such deformed feet avoided placing weight on the front of the foot and tended to walk predominantly on their heels. As a result, women who had undergone foot-binding would walk in a cautious and unsteady manner.&lt;ref name=slippers /&gt;  Some men found the smell of the bound feet attractive, and some also apparently believed that bound feet would cause layers of folds to develop in the vagina, and that the thighs would become sensuously heavier and the vagina tighter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xmdKklZM9-kC&amp;pg=PA117#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Bodies under Siege: Self-mutilation, Nonsuicidal Self-injury, and Body Modification in Culture and Psychiatry|author= Armando R.

===Role of Confucianism===
[[File:A HIGH CASTE LADYS DAINTY LILY FEET.jpg|thumb|220px|A woman with her feet unwrapped]]

A common argument is that the revival of [[Confucianism]] as [[Neo-Confucianism]] during the Song dynasty resulted in the decline of the status of women, and that in addition to promoting the seclusion of women and the [[cult of widow chastity]], it also contributed to the development of footbinding.&lt;ref name="ebrey 2"/&gt; According to [[Robert van Gulik]], the prominent Song Confucian scholar [[Zhu Xi]] stressed the inferiority of women as well as the need to keep men and women strictly separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= Chinese Outcasts: Discrimination and Emancipation in Late Imperial China|author= Anders Hansson|page=46 |publisher=Brill |year= 1996 |isbn= 978-9004105966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was claimed by [[Lin Yutang]] among others, probably based on an oral tradition, that [[Zhu Xi]] also promoted footbinding in [[Fujian]] as a way of encouraging chastity among women, that by restricting their movement it would help keep men and women separate.&lt;ref name="ebrey 2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GDPskRXfl5cC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women and the Family in Chinese History|author= Patricia Buckley Ebrey |pages=10&amp;ndash;12|publisher=Routledge |date=19 September 2002 |isbn= 978-0415288224}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historian [[Patricia Buckley Ebrey|Patricia Ebrey]] suggests that this story might be fictitious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA139|title= Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation |author= Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |date= April 2006|isbn= 978-0-7914-6749-7 |page=139 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Confucian moralists in fact disapproved of the erotic associations of footbinding, and unbound women were also praised.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bonnie G. Smith|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History: 4 Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&amp;pg=PA358|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-514890-9|pages=358–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Neo-Confucian [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] was said to be against footbinding and his family and descendants did not bind their feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=丁传靖 编|title=《宋人轶事汇编》|location=北京|publisher=中华书局|date=1981|page=卷9，第2册，页455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/foot-binding-and-ruism-confucianism_us_58c86e8fe4b01d0d473bceed |title=Foot-binding and Ruism (Confucianism)|date=16 March 2017 |author= Bin Song|work=Huffington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern Confucian scholars such as [[Tu Weiming]] also dispute any causal link between neo-Confucianism and footbinding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Confucian thought: selfhood as creative transformation|author= Tu Wei-ming|publisher= State University of New York Press|date= 1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that Confucian doctrine in fact prohibits mutilation of the body as people should not "injure even the hair and skin of the body received from mother and father". It is however argued that such injunction applies less to women, rather it is meant to emphasize the sacred link between sons and their parents. Furthermore, it is argued that Confucianism institutionalized the family system in which women are called upon to sacrifice themselves for the good of the family, a system that fostered such practice.&lt;ref name="blake"/&gt; Confucian instructions on the moral behaviour of women would include examples of women who were prepared to die or suffer mutilation to show their commitment to the Confucian ethos.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;

Historian [[Dorothy Y. Ko|Dorothy Ko]] proposed that footbinding may be an expression of the Confucian ideals of civility and culture in the form of correct attire or bodily adornment, and that footbinding was seen as a necessary part of being feminine as well as being civilized.  Footbinding was often classified in Chinese encyclopedia as clothing or a form of bodily embellishment rather than mutilation; one from 1591 for example placed footbinding in a section on "Female Adornments" that included hairdos, powders, and ear-piercings.  According to Ko, the perception of footbinding as a civilised practice may be evinced from a [[Ming dynasty]] account that mentioned a proposal to "entice [the barbarians] to civilize their customs" by encouraging footbinding among their womenfolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://womenshistory.osu.edu/sites/womenshistory.osu.edu/files/The%20Body%20as%20Attire.pdf |title=The Body as Attire: The Shifting Meanings of Footbinding in Seventeenth-Century China |journal=Journal of Women's History|volume =8|number= 4 |date= 1997 |pages= 8–27 |doi= 10.1353/jowh.2010.0171 |first=Dorothy|last= Ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice was also carried out only by women on girls, and it served to emphasize the distinction between male and female, an emphasis that began from an early age.&lt;ref name="steele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ko1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorothy Ko|title=Teachers of the Inner Chambers: Women and Culture in Seventeenth-century China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0nNcRiE-TKsC&amp;pg=PA149|year=1994|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2359-6|pages=149–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist Fred Blake argued that the practice of footbinding was a form of discipline undertaken by women themselves, and perpetuated by women on their daughters, so as to inform their daughters of their role and position in society, and to support and participate in the neo-Confucian way of being civilized.&lt;ref name="blake"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://anthropology.hawaii.edu/People/Faculty/Blake/pdfs/1994%20%20Foot-binding%20in%20Neo-Confucian%20China.pdf|title=Foot-Binding in Neo-Confucian China and the Appropriation of Female Labor | author=C.

===Feminist perspective===
{{Violence against women|sp=uk}}
Foot binding is often seen by feminists as an oppressive practice against women who were victims of a sexist culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTvLQbaH81wC&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Confucianism and Women: A Philosophical Interpretation |authors=Li-Hsiang Lisa Rosenlee |page=139 | isbn=9780791481790|publisher= SUNY Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rophdLUYIjcC&amp;pg=PT246#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding, Feminism and Freedom: The Liberation of Women's Bodies in Modern China|author= Fan Hong|isbn=9781136303142 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also widely seen as a form of violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ac2UAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA423 |title=Ordinary Violence: Everyday Assaults against Women Worldwide|edition= 2nd|author= Mary White Stewart |pages=423–437 |publisher=Praeger|date=27 January 2014|isbn= 9781440829383}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BOKAMXEA_jQC&amp;pg=PA310 |title=Encyclopedia of Interpersonal Violence, Volume 1 |editors= Claire M.

She argued that women, by retaining their small bound feet, made themselves subservient as it would mean women imprisoning themselves indoors. She believed that women should emancipate themselves from oppression, that girls can ensure their independence through education, and that they should develop new mental and physical qualities fitting for the new era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cLd_h5Hh00C&amp;pg=PA93#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding, Feminism, and Freedom: The Liberation of Women's Bodies in Modern China|author= Hong Fan |publisher= Routledge |pages= 90–96|date=1 June 1997|isbn= 978-0714646336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="qiu jin"/&gt; The ending of the practice is seen as a significant event in the process of female emancipation in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_cLd_h5Hh00C&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Footbinding, Feminism, and Freedom: The Liberation of Women's Bodies in Modern China|author= Hong Fan |publisher= Routledge |date=1 June 1997|isbn= 978-0714646336 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other interpretations===

Some scholars such as Laurel Bossen and Hill Gates reject the theories that bound feet in China were considered more beautiful, or that it was a means of male control over women, a sign of class status, or a chance for women to marry well. They argued that foot binding was important in work, and can be seen as a way by mothers to tie their daughters down, train them in handwork and keep them close at hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/12/unraveling-a-brutal-custom/ |title=Unraveling a brutal custom |author=Colleen Walsh |work=Harvard Gazette |date=December 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Footbinding and Women's Labor in Sichuan|author= Hill Gates |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEK2BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Routledge |year= 2014 |isbn=978-0-415-52592-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been argued that while the practice started out as a fashion, it persisted because it became an expression of Han identity after the Mongols invaded China in 1279, and later the Manchus' conquest in 1644, as it was then practiced only by Han women.&lt;ref name=smithsonian /&gt;&lt;ref name="steele"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Lw1_yKwk_XkC&amp;pg=PA40 |pages=40–41 |title=China Chic: East Meets West|author1=Valerie Steele |author2=John S. Major |publisher=Yale University Press |year= 2000 |isbn=978-0-300-07931-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Qing Dynasty, attempts were made by the Manchus to ban the practice but failed, and it has been argued the attempts at banning may have in fact led to a spread of the practice among Han Chinese in the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIaIP0jyBPAC&amp;pg=PA266#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cinderella's Sisters: A Revisionist History of Footbinding|author= Dorothy Ko |publisher=University of California Press |year= 2008 |page=266 |isbn=978-0-520-25390-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature, film and television ==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
&lt;!-- This is not a place to list every novel that mentions footbinding, or a film or TV shows that happens to have a character with bound feet. --&gt;

The bound foot has played a prominent part in many media works, both Chinese and non-Chinese, modern and traditional. These depictions are sometimes based on observation or research and sometimes on rumors or supposition. Sometimes, as in the case of [[Pearl Buck]]'s ''[[The Good Earth]]'' (1931), the accounts are relatively neutral, implying a respect for Chinese culture and assuming that it is not the role of outsiders to promote reform. Sometimes the accounts seem intended to rouse like-minded Chinese and foreign opinion to abolish the custom, and sometimes the accounts imply [[wikt:condescension|condescension]] or [[wikt:contempt|contempt]] for China.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Ebrey, "Gender and Sinology: Shifting Western Interpretations of Footbinding, 1300–1890", ''Late Imperial China'' 20.2  (1999): 1-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forensic entomology''' is the scientific study of the invasion of the succession pattern of [[arthropods]] with their developmental stages of different species found on the decomposed cadavers during legal investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Verma K, Paul R | title= ''Lucilia sericata'' (Meigen) and ''Chrysomya megacephala'' (Fabricius) (Diptera: Calliphoridae) Development Rate and its Implications for Forensic Entomology | journal= J Forensic Sci Med | year=2016 | volume=2 | issue=3 | pages=146–150 | doi=10.4103/2349-5014.191466}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is the application and study of [[insect]] and other [[arthropod]] biology to criminal matters. It also involves the application of the study of arthropods, including insects, arachnids, centipedes, millipedes, and crustaceans to criminal or legal cases. It is primarily associated with death investigations; however, it may also be used to detect drugs and poisons, determine the location of an incident, and find the presence and time of the infliction of wounds. Forensic [[entomology]] can be divided into three subfields: [[Forensic entomology#Urban forensic entomology|urban]], [[Home stored product entomology|stored-product]] and [[Forensic entomology#Medico-legal forensic entomology|medico-legal/medico-criminal]] entomology.

==History==
Historically, there have been several accounts of applications for, and experimentation with, forensic entomology. The concept of forensic entomology dates back to at least the 13th century. However, only in the last 30 years has forensic entomology been systematically explored as a feasible source for evidence in [[criminal investigation]]s. Through their own experiments and interest in arthropods and death, [[Sung Tzu]], [[Francesco Redi]], [[Louis François Etienne Bergeret|Bergeret d’Arbois]], [[Jean Pierre Mégnin]] and the physiologist [[Hermann Reinhard]] have helped to lay the foundations for today's modern forensic entomology.

===Song Ci===
The Song Dynasty (960–1279) [[forensic science]] book ''[[Collected Cases of Injustice Rectified]]'' published by court judge, physician, medical scientist and writer [[Song Ci]] in 1247 contains the oldest known case of forensic entomology.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"&gt;Haskell (2006), 432.&lt;/ref&gt; In a murder case of 1235, a villager was stabbed to death and authorities determined that his wounds were inflicted by a [[sickle]]; this was a tool used for cutting rice at harvest time, a fact which led them to suspect a fellow peasant worker was involved.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"/&gt; The local magistrate had the villagers assemble in the town square where they would temporarily relinquish their sickles.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"/&gt; Within minutes, a mass of [[Blow-fly|blow flies]] gathered around one sickle and none other, attracted to the scent of traces of [[blood]] unseen by the naked eye.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"/&gt; It became apparent to all that the owner of that sickle was the culprit, the latter pleading for mercy as he was detained by authorities.&lt;ref name="haskell 2006 432"/&gt;

Song Ci (sometimes referred to as Sung Tzu) was a judicial intendant who lived in China 1188-1251 AD. In 1247 AD Song Ci wrote a book entitled ''[[Washing Away of Wrongs]]'' as a handbook for coroners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=T'and-Yin-Pi-Shih: Parallel cases from under the pear-tree | author=R.H. van Gulik | authorlink=Robert van Gulik | edition=reprint | publisher=Gibson Press | origyear=1956| year=2004 | isbn=0-88355-908-0 | page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this book Song Ci depicts several cases in which he took notes on how a person died and elaborates on probable causes. He explains in detail on how to examine a corpse both before and after burial. He also explains the process of how to determine a probable cause of death. The main purpose of this book was to be used as a guide for other investigators so they could assess the scene of the crime effectively. His level of detail in explaining what he observed in all his cases laid down the fundamentals for modern forensic entomologists and is the first recorded account in history of someone using forensic entomology for judicial means.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tz’u., B.E. Mc Knight 1981, The Washing Away Of Wrongs, Center for Chinese Studies The University of Michigan, Pages 1-34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Francesco Redi===
{{further|Francesco Redi}}
In 1668, Italian physician Francesco Redi disproved the theory of [[spontaneous generation]]. The accepted theory of Redi's day claimed that [[maggots]] developed spontaneously from rotting meat. In an experiment, he used samples of rotting meat that were either fully exposed to the air, partially exposed to the air, or not exposed to air at all. Redi showed that both fully and partially exposed rotting meat developed fly [[maggots]], whereas rotting meat that was not exposed to air did not develop maggots. This discovery completely changed the way people viewed the decomposition of organisms and prompted further investigations into insect life cycles and into entomology in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://microbes.historique.net/history2.html | title=A History of Microbiology | publisher=Historique.net | date=30 April 2003 | accessdate=12 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bergeret d'Arbois===
Dr. [[Louis François Etienne Bergeret]] (1814–1893) was a French hospital physician, and was the first to apply forensic entomology to a case. In a case report published in 1855 he stated a general life cycle for insects and made many assumptions about their mating habits. Nevertheless, these assumptions led him to the first application of forensic entomology in an estimation of [[post-mortem interval]] (PMI). His report used forensic entomology as tool to prove his hypothesis on how and when the person had died.&lt;ref name=Benecke&gt;{{cite journal | author=Benecke M. | title=A brief history of forensic entomology | journal=Forensic Sci. Int. | year=2001 | volume=120 | issue=1–2 | pages=2–14 | pmid=11457602  | doi=10.1016/S0379-0738(01)00409-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hermann Reinhard===
The first systematic study in forensic entomology was conducted in 1881 by [[Hermann Reinhard]], a German medical doctor who played a vital role in the history of forensic entomology. He exhumed many bodies and demonstrated that the development of many different types of insect species could be tied to buried bodies. Reinhard conducted his first study in east Germany, and collected many [[Phoridae|Phorid flies]] from this initial study. He also concluded that the development of only some of the insects living with corpses underground were associated with them, since there were 15-year-old beetles who had little direct contact with them. Reinhard's works and studies were used extensively in further forensic entomology studies.

===Jean Pierre Mégnin===
{{further|Jean Pierre Mégnin}}
French veterinarian and entomologist  Jean Pierre Mégnin (1828–1905), published many articles and books on various subjects including the books ''Faune des Tombeaux'' and ''La Faune des Cadavres'', which are considered to be among the most important forensic entomology books in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Klotzbach H, Krettek R | title=The history of forensic entomology in German-speaking countries | journal=Forensic Sci. Int. | year=2004 | volume=144 | issue=2–3 | pages=259–263 | pmid=15364399  | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2004.04.062|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second book he did revolutionary work on the theory of predictable waves, or successions of insects onto corpses. By counting numbers of live and dead mites that developed every 15 days and comparing this with his initial count on the infant, he was able to estimate how long that infant was dead.&lt;ref name=Benecke/&gt;

In this book, he asserted that exposed corpses were subject to eight successional waves, whereas buried corpses were only subject to two waves. Mégnin made many great discoveries that helped shed new light on many of the general characteristics of decaying flora and fauna. Mégnin's work and study of the larval and adult forms of insect families found in cadavers sparked the interest of future entomologists and encouraged more research in the link between arthropods and the deceased, and thereby helped to establish the scientific discipline of forensic entomology.

==Forensic entomology subfields==

===Urban forensic entomology===
Urban forensic entomology typically concerns pests infestations in buildings gardens or that may be the basis of litigation between private parties and service providers such as landlords or exterminators.&lt;ref name="Catts"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Catts |first=E. P. |authorlink= |author2=Goff, M. L. |date=January 1992| title = Forensic Entomology in Criminal Investigations|journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=37 |issue= |pages=253–272 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.37.010192.001345 |url= |quote=|pmid=1539937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Urban forensic entomology studies may also indicate the appropriateness of certain pesticide treatments and may also be used in stored products cases where it can help to determine chain of custody, when all points of possible infestation are examined in order to determine who is at fault.&lt;ref&gt;Bledsoe 2008, personal interview&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stored-product forensic entomology===
{{further|Home stored product entomology}}
Stored-product forensic entomology is often used in litigation over insect infestation or contamination of commercially distributed foods.&lt;ref name="Catts"/&gt;

===Medico-legal forensic entomology===
Medicolegal forensic entomology covers evidence gathered through arthropod studies at the scenes of murder, suicide, rape, physical abuse and contraband trafficking.&lt;ref name="Catts" /&gt; In murder investigations it deals with which [[insect]]s eggs appear, their location on the body and in what order they appear. This can be helpful in determining a [[post mortem interval]] (PMI) and location of a [[death]] in question. Since many insects exhibit a degree of [[endemism]] (occurring only in certain places), or have a well-defined [[phenology]] (active only at a certain season, or time of day), their presence in association with other evidence can demonstrate potential links to times and locations where other events may have occurred.&lt;ref&gt;https://peerj.com/articles/3506/?td=wk | Use of necrophagous insects as evidence of cadaver relocation: myth or reality?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eggheadblog.ucdavis.edu/?p=502 |title=Insects help convict killer |accessdate=1 April 2008 |format= |work= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820070919/http://eggheadblog.ucdavis.edu/?p=502 |archivedate=20 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another area covered by medicolegal forensic entomology is the relatively new field of [[entomotoxicology]]. This particular branch involves the utilization of entomological specimens found at a scene in order to test for different drugs that may have possibly played a role in the death of the victim.

===Scorpionflies===

Scorpionflies (order [[Mecoptera]]) were the first insects to arrive at a donated human cadaver observed (by the entomologist Natalie Lindgren) at the Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science Facility near [[Huntsville, Texas]], and remained on the corpse for one and a half days, outnumbering flies during that period. The presence of scorpionflies thus indicates that a body must be fresh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rutsch |first1=Poncie |title=Finding Crime Clues In What Insects Had For Dinner |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/01/22/379091257/finding-crime-clues-in-what-insects-had-for-dinner |publisher=NPR |accessdate=22 June 2015 |date=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Southeast Texas Applied Forensic Science Facility |url=http://www.shsu.edu/~stafs/ |publisher=STAFS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flies===

[[Calliphora latifrons|Flies]] (order [[Diptera]]) are often first on the scene. They prefer a moist corpse for their offspring (maggots) to feed on. The most significant types of fly include:

*Blow flies – Family [[Calliphoridae]]- Flies in this family are often metallic in appearance and between 10 and 14&amp;nbsp;mm in length. In addition to the name blow-fly, some members of this family are known as [[Calliphora latifrons|blue bottle fly]], [[cluster fly]], [[Green bottle fly|greenbottle]]s, or [[Protophormia terraenovae|black blowfly]]. A characteristic of the blow-fly is its 3-segmented [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Hatching from an egg to the first larval stage takes from eight hours to one day. [[Larva]]e have three stages of development (called [[instars]]); each stage is separated by a molting event. Worldwide, there are 1100 known species of blowflies, with 228 species in the [[Neotropics]], and a large number of species in [[Africa]] and Southern [[Europe]]. The most common area to find Calliphoridae species are in the countries of [[India]], [[Japan]], [[Central America]], and in the southern United States. The typical habitat for blow-flies are temperate to tropical areas that provide a layer of loose, damp soil and litter where larvae may thrive and pupate. The forensic importance of this fly is that it is the first [[insect]] to come in contact with [[carrion]] because they have the ability to smell death from up to ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2010/sep/23/flies-murder-natural-history-museum |title=Lord of the flies: the insect detectives |vauthors = Henley J |date=September 23, 2010 |website=The Guardian |publisher= Guardian News and Media Ltd |access-date=November 13, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sarcophaga nodosa.jpg|thumb|220px|Flesh fly on decomposing flesh]]
*Flesh flies – Family [[Sarcophagidae]]- Most flesh flies breed in carrion, dung, garbage, or decaying material, but a few species lay their eggs in the open wounds of mammals; hence their common name. Characteristics of the flesh-fly is its 3-segmented [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]]. Most [[holarctic]] Sarcophagidae vary in size from 4 to 18&amp;nbsp;mm in length (Tropical species can be larger) with black and gray longitudinal stripes on the [[thorax]] and checkering on the [[abdomen]]. Flesh-flies, being viviparous, frequently give birth to live young on [[corpses]] of human and other animals, at any stage of decomposition, from newly dead through to bloated or decaying (though the latter is more common).
*[[Housefly|House fly]] – Family [[Muscidae]]- is the most common of all [[flies]] found in homes, and indeed one of the most widely distributed insects; it is often considered a [[Pest (organism)|pest]] that can carry serious diseases. The adults are 6–9&amp;nbsp;mm long. Their [[thorax]] is gray, with four longitudinal dark lines on the back. The underside of their abdomen is yellow, and their whole body is covered with hair.  Each female fly can lay up to 500 eggs in several batches of about 75 to 150 [[Egg (biology)|eggs]]. Genus ''[[Hydrotaea]]'' are of particular forensic importance.
*Cheese flies – Family [[Piophilidae]] - Most are scavengers in animal products and fungi. The best-known member of the family is ''[[Piophila casei]]''. It is a small fly, about four mm (1/6&amp;nbsp;inch) long, found worldwide. This fly's larva infests cured meats, smoked fish, cheeses, and decaying animals and is sometimes called the cheese skipper for its leaping ability. Forensic entomology uses the presence of Piophila casei larvae to help estimate the date of death for human remains. They do not take up residence in a corpse until three to six months after death. The adult fly's body is black, blue-black, or bronze, with some yellow on the head, antennae, and legs. The wings are faintly [[iridescent]] and lie flat upon the fly's [[abdomen]] when at rest. At four mm (1/6&amp;nbsp;inch) long, the fly is one-third to one-half as long as the common [[housefly]].
*Coffin flies – [[Phoridae]]
*Lesser corpse flies – [[Sphaeroceridae]]
*Lesser house flies – [[Fanniidae]]
*Black scavenger flies – [[Sepsidae]]
*Sun flies - [[Heleomyzidae]]
*[[Black soldier fly]] - [[Stratiomyidae]] - have potential for use in forensic entomology. The larvae are common [[scavengers]] in compost heaps, are found in association with carrion, can be destructive pests in honey bee hives, and are used in [[manure]] management (for both [[house fly]] control and reduction in manure volume). The larvae range in size from 1/8 to 3/4 of an inch (3 to 19 millimeters). The adult fly is a [[mimic]], very close in size, color, and appearance to the [[organ pipe mud dauber]] wasp and its relatives.
*Phoridae – Humpbacked flies&lt;br /&gt;Larvae feed on decaying bodies. Some species can burrow to a depth of 50&amp;nbsp;cm over 4 days. Important in buried bodies.
*Non-biting midges - [[Chironomidae]] - these flies have a complex life cycle. While adults are terrestrial and phytophagous, larvae are aquatic and detritivorous. Immature instars have been used as forensic markers in several cases where submerged corpses were found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=González Medina A, Soriano Hernando Ó, Jiménez Ríos G | title=The Use of the Developmental Rate of the Aquatic Midge ''Chironomus riparius'' (Diptera, Chironomidae) in the Assessment of the Postsubmersion Interval | journal=J. Forensic Sci. | year=2015 | volume=60 | issue=3 | pages=822–826 | doi=10.1111/1556-4029.12707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beetles===

[[Beetle]]s (Order [[Coleoptera]]) are generally found on the corpse when it is more decomposed.&lt;ref&gt;Midgley JM, Richards CS, Villet MH, 2010. The utility of Coleoptera in forensic investigations. In: Amendt J, Campobasso CP, Goff ML, Grassberger M, eds. Current concepts in forensic entomology. Heidelberg: Springer, 57-68.&lt;/ref&gt; In drier conditions, the beetles can be replaced by moth flies ([[Psychodidae]]).

*Rove beetles – family [[Staphylinidae]] – are elongate beetles with small [[elytra]] (wing covers) and large jaws. Like other beetles inhabiting carrion, they have fast [[larval]] development with only three larval stages. [[Creophilus]] species are common predators of carrion, and since they are large, are a very visible component of the fauna of corpses. Some adult Staphylinidae are early visitors to a corpse, feeding on larvae of all species of fly, including the later predatory fly larvae. They lay their eggs in the corpse, and the emerging larvae are also predators. Some species have a long development time in the egg, and are common only during the later stages of decomposition. Staphylinids can also tear open the [[pupa]]l cases of flies, to sustain themselves at a corpse for long periods.
*Hister beetles – family [[Histeridae]]. Adult histerids are usually shiny beetles (black or metallic-green) which have an introverted head. The carrion-feeding species only become active at night when they enter the maggot-infested part of the corpse to capture and devour their maggot prey. During daylight they hide under the corpse unless it is sufficiently decayed to enable them to hide inside it. They have fast larval development with only two larval stages. Among the first beetles to arrive at a corpse are Histeridae of the genus ''[[Saprinus]]''. ''Saprinus'' adults feed on both the larvae and pupae of [[blowflies]], although some have a preference for fresh pupae. The adults lay their eggs in the corpse, inhabiting it in the later stages of decay.
*Carrion beetles – family [[Silphidae]]- Adult Silphidae have an average size of about 12&amp;nbsp;mm. They are also referred to as burying beetles because they dig and bury small carcasses underground.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Michelle Pellissier |date=January 1998 |title=The ecology and behavior of burying beetles |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=43 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.43.1.595 |pages=595–618 |pmid=15012399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both parents tend to their young and exhibit communial breeding. The male carrion beetle's job in care is to provide protection for the breed and carcass from competitors.
*Ham beetles – family [[Cleridae]]
*Carcass beetles – family [[Trogidae]]
* Skin/hide beetles – family [[Dermestidae]]. Hide beetles are important in the final stages of decomposition of a carcass. The adults and larvae feed on the dried skin, tendons and bone left by fly larvae. Hide beetles are the only beetle with the enzymes necessary for breaking down [[keratin]], a protein component of hair.
*Scarab beetles – family [[Scarabaeidae]]- Scarab beetles may be any one of around 30,000 beetle species worldwide that are compact, heavy-bodied and oval in shape. The flattened plates, which each antenna terminates, are fitted together to form a club. The outer edges of the front legs may also be toothed or scalloped. Scarab beetles range from {{convert|0.2|to|4.8|in|mm|abbr=on}} in length. These species are known for being one of the heaviest insect species.&lt;ref&gt;unknown, www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1B1-377894.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sap beetles – family [[Nitidulidae]]

===Mites===

Many [[mite]]s (class [[Acari]], not insects) feed on corpses with ''Macrocheles'' mites common in the early stages of decomposition, while Tyroglyphidae and Oribatidae mites such as Rostrozetes feed on dry skin in the later stages of decomposition.

''[[Nicrophorus]]'' beetles often carry on their bodies the mite ''[[Poecilochirus]]'' which feed on fly eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=González Medina A, González Herrera L, Perotti MA, Jiménez Ríos G | title=Occurrence of ''Poecilochirus austroasiaticus'' (Acari: Parasitidae) in forensic autopsies and its application on postmortem interval estimation | journal=Exp. Appl. Acarol. | year=2013 | volume=59 | issue=3 | pages=297–305 | doi=10.1007/s10493-012-9606-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; If they arrive at the corpse before any fly eggs hatch into maggots, the first eggs are eaten and maggot development is delayed. This may lead to incorrect PMI estimates. ''Nicrophorus'' beetles find the [[ammonia]] excretions of blowfly maggots toxic, and the ''Poecilochirus'' mites, by keeping the maggot population low, allow ''Nicrophorus'' to occupy the corpse.

===Moths===

[[Moth]]s (order [[Lepidoptera]]) specifically [[clothes-moth]]s – Family [[Tineidae]] – are closely related to [[butterfly|butterflies]]. Most species of moth are [[nocturnal]], but there are [[crepuscular]] and [[Diurnality|diurnal]] species. Moths feed on mammalian hair during their larval stages and may forage on any hair that remains on a body.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} They are amongst the final animals contributing to the decomposition of a corpse.

===Wasps, ants, and bees===

Wasps, ants, and bees (order [[Hymenoptera]]) are not necessarily necrophagous. While some feed on the body, some are also predatory, and eat the insects feeding on the body. [[Bee]]s and [[wasp]]s have been seen feeding on the body during the early stages.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} This may cause problems for murder cases in which larval flies are used to estimate the post mortem interval since eggs and larvae on the body may have been consumed prior to the arrival on scene of investigators.

==Factors==

===Moisture levels===

Rain and [[humidity]] levels in the area where the body is found can affect the time for insect development. In most species, large amounts of rain will indirectly cause slower development due to drop in temperature. Light rain or a very humid environment, by acting as an insulator, will permit a greater [[core temperature]] within the maggot mass, resulting in faster development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clt.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/112507/fse07_forensic_entomology.pdf "Forensic entomology: use of insects to help solve crimes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119175704/http://www.clt.uwa.edu.au/__data/page/112507/fse07_forensic_entomology.pdf |date=19 January 2012 }}. Uwa.edu.au. 20 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vilet MH, Richards CS, Midgley JM, 2010. Contemporary precision, bias and accuracy of minimum post-mortem intervals estimated using development of carrion-feeding insects. In: Amendt J, Campobasso CP, Goff ML, Grassberger M, eds. Current concepts in forensic entomology. Heidelberg: Springer, 109-137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Submerged corpses===
M. Lee Goff, a noted and well respected [[forensic entomologist]], was assigned to a case involving the discovery of a decomposing body found on a boat half a mile from shore. Upon collection of the maggot mass, only one insect, ''Chrysomya megacephala'', was discovered. He concluded that the water barrier accounted for the scarcity of other flies. He also noted that flies will not attempt to trek across large bodies of water unless there is a substantially influential attractant.

In addition, the amount of time a maggot mass has been exposed to salt water can affect its development. From the cases Goff observed he found that if subjected for more than 30 minutes, there was a 24‑hour developmental delay. Unfortunately, not many more studies have been conducted and thus a specific amount of delay time is difficult to estimate.&lt;ref name="Goff, M. L 2000"&gt;Goff, M. L. A Fly for the Prosecution. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sun exposure===
"Because insects are cold-blooded animals, their rate of development is more or less dependent on ambient temperature." &lt;ref&gt;Catts, E. P. and N. H. Haskell, eds. ''Entomology &amp; Death: A Procedural Guide''. Joyce's Print Shop, Inc. 1990. p5.&lt;/ref&gt;
Bodies exposed to large amounts of sunlight will heat up, giving the insects a warmer area to develop, reducing their development time.
An experiment conducted by Bernard Greenberg and John Charles Kunich with the use of rabbit carcasses to study accumulation of degree days found that with temperature ranging in the mid 70s to high 80s the amount of developmental time for maggots was significantly reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Bernard, and John C. Kunich. Entomology and the Law. United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, bodies found in shaded areas will be cooler, and insects will require longer growth periods. In addition, if temperatures reach extreme levels of cold, insects instinctively know to prolong their development time in order to hatch into a more accepting and viable climate in order to increase the chance of survival and reproduction.

===Air exposure===
Hanged bodies can be expected to show their own quantity and variety of flies. Also, the amount of time flies will stay on a hanged body will vary in comparison to one found on the ground. A hanged body is more exposed to air and thus will dry out faster leaving less food source for the maggots.

As the body begins to decompose, a compilation of fluids will leak to the ground. In this area most of the expected fauna can be found. Also, it is more likely that rove beetles and other non-flying  insects will be found here instead of directly on the body. Fly maggots, initially deposited on the body, may also be found below.&lt;ref name="Goff, M. L 2000"/&gt;

===Geography===
According to [[Jean Pierre Mégnin]]'s book ''La Faune des Cadavres'' there are eight distinct faunal successions attracted to a corpse. While most [[beetle]]s and [[fly|flies]] of forensic importance can be found worldwide, a portion of them are limited to a specific range of habitats. It is forensically important to know the geographical distribution of these insects is order to determine information such as post mortem interval or whether a body has been moved from its original place of death.

[[Calliphoridae]] is arguably the most important family concerning forensic entomology given that they are the first to arrive on the corpse. The family’s habitat ranges into the southern portion of the [[United States]]. However, while ''Chrysomya rufifaces'', the hairy maggot [[Calliphoridae|blow fly]], is part of the family Calliphoridae and is widespread, it is not prevalent in the Southern [[California]], [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Louisiana]], [[Florida]], or [[Illinois]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Whitworth | first1= Terry |title=Keys to Genera and Species of Blow Flies of America North of Mexico |journal = Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Washington | volume= 108 |issue=3 |year=2006 |page= 710 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/30254115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Flesh fly|Flesh flies]] fall under the family Sacrophagidae and generally arrive to a corpse following Calliphoridae. However, as previously mentioned they are capable of flying in the rain. This key advantage enables them to occasionally reach a body before Calliphoridae overall effecting the maggot mass that will be discovered. Flesh flies are globally distributed including habitats in the United States, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Pape, Thomas. ''Catalog of the Sarcophagidae of the World''. Memoirs on Entomology. Gainesville, FL: Associated, 1996. 288-289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beetles are representative of the order [[Coleoptera]] which accounts for the largest of the insect orders. Beetles are very adaptive and can be found in almost all environments with the exception of [[Antarctica]] and high mountainous regions. The most diverse beetle fauna can be found in the tropics. In addition, beetles are less submissive to temperatures. Thus, if a carcass has been found in cold temperatures, the beetle will be prevalent over Calliphoridae.

===Weather===
Various weather conditions in a given amount of time cause certain pests to invade human households. This is because the insects are in search of food, water, and shelter.
Damp weather causes reproduction and growth enhancement in many insect types, especially when coupled with warm temperatures. Most pests concerned at this time are [[ant]]s, [[spider]]s, [[cricket (insect)|cricket]]s, [[cockroach]]es, [[ladybug]]s, [[yellowjacket]]s, [[hornet]]s, [[mouse|mice]], and [[rat]]s.
When conditions are dry, the deprivation of moisture outside drives many pests inside searching for water. While the rainy weather increases the numbers of insects, this dry weather causes pest invasions to increase. The pests most commonly known during dry conditions are [[scorpion]]s, ants, [[pillbug]]s, [[millipede]]s, crickets, and spiders. Extreme drought does kill many populations of insects, but also drives surviving insects to invade more often.
Cold temperatures outside will cause invasions beginning in the late summer months and early fall. [[Box elder bug]]s, [[cluster fly|cluster flies]], ladybugs, and [[silverfish]] are noticed some of the most common insects to seek the warm indoors.&lt;ref name="terminix"&gt;[http://terminix.com/information/weather/ "Pest Control Tips: Pests and Weather"]. ''Terminix.com''. 19 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern techniques==
Many new techniques have been developed &lt;ref&gt;Villet MH, Amendt J, 2011. Advances in entomological methods for estimating time of death. In: Turk EE, ed. Forensic Pathology Reviews. Heidelberg: Humana Press, pp. 213-238&lt;/ref&gt; and are used in order to more accurately [[entomological evidence collection|gather evidence]], or reevaluate old information. The use of these newly developed techniques and evaluations have become relevant in litigation and appeals. Forensic entomology not only uses arthropod biology, but it pulls from other sciences, introducing fields like chemistry and genetics, exploiting their inherent synergy through the [[use of DNA in forensic entomology]].

===Scanning electron microscopy===
Fly larvae and fly eggs are used to aid in the determination of a PMI. In order for the data to be useful the larvae and eggs must be identified down to a species level to get an accurate estimate for the PMI. There are many techniques currently being developed to differentiate between the various species of forensically important insects. A study in 2007 demonstrates a technique that can use [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM) to identify key morphological features of eggs and maggots.&lt;ref name="pmid18353656"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mendonça PM, dos Santos-Mallet JR, de Mello RP, Gomes L, de Carvalho Queiroz MM | title = Identification of fly eggs using scanning electron microscopy for forensic investigations | journal = Micron | volume = 39 | issue = 7 | pages = 802–7 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18353656 | doi = 10.1016/j.micron.2008.01.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the morphological differences that can help identify the different species are the presence/absence of anastomosis, the presence/absence of holes, and the shape and length of the median area.

The SEM method provides an array of morphological features for use in identifying fly eggs; however, this method does have some disadvantages. The main disadvantage is that it requires expensive equipment and can take time to identify the species from which the egg originated, so it may not be useful in a field study or to quickly identify a particular egg.&lt;ref name=Sukontason&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sukontason|first1=Kom|last2=Sukontason|first2=Kabkaew L|last3=Piangjai|first3=Somsak|last4=Boonchu|first4=Noppawan|last5=Kurahashi|first5=Hiromu|last6=Hope|first6=Michelle|last7=Olson|first7=Jimmy K|title=Identification of forensically important fly eggs using a potassium permanganate staining technique|journal=Micron|volume=35|issue=5|year=2004|pages=391–395|issn=0968-4328|doi=10.1016/j.micron.2003.12.004|pmid=15006363}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The SEM method is effective provided there is ample time and the proper equipment and the particular fly eggs are plentiful. The ability to use these morphological differences gives forensic entomologists a powerful tool that can help with estimating a post mortem interval, along with other relevant information, such as whether the body has been disturbed post mortem.

===Potassium permanganate staining===
When scanning electron microscopy is not available, a faster, lower cost technique is [[potassium permanganate]] staining. The collected eggs are rinsed with a [[Saline (medicine)|normal saline]] solution and placed in a glass petri dish. The eggs are soaked in a 1% potassium permanganate solution for one minute and then dehydrated and mounted onto a slide for observation.&lt;ref name=Sukontason/&gt; These slides can be used with any [[Optical microscope|light microscope]] with a calibrated eyepiece to compare various morphological features. The most important and useful features for identifying eggs are the size, length, and width of the plastron, as well as the morphology of the plastron in the area around the micropyle.&lt;ref name=Sukontason/&gt; The various measurements and observations when compared to standards for forensically important species are used to determine the species of the egg.

===Mitochondrial DNA===
In 2001, a method was devised by Jeffrey Wells and Felix Sperling to use [[mitochondrial DNA]] to differentiate between different species of the subfamily Chrysomyinae. This is particularly useful when working to determine the identity of specimens that do not have distinctive morphological characteristics at certain life stages.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, D. and Sperling Felix A. H. "DNA-based identification of forensically important Chrysomyinae (Diptera: Calliphoridae)"Forensic Science International Volume 120, Issues 1-215 August 2001 110-115 . 3 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mock crime scenes===
A valuable tool that is becoming very common in the training of forensic entomologists is the use of mock crime scenes using pig carcasses. The pig carcass represents a human body and can be used to illustrate various environmental effects on both arthropod succession and the estimate of the post mortem interval.&lt;ref&gt;Schoenly, Kenneth G. [http://www.nabt.org/sites/S1/index.php?p=2 "Recreating Death's Acre in the School Yard: Using Pig Carcasses as Model"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} American Biology Teacher v68 n7 September 2006 402-410 . 3 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gene expression studies===
Although physical characteristics and sizes at various [[instars]] have been used to estimate fly age, a more recent study has been conducted to determine the age of an egg based on the expression of particular genes. This is particularly useful in determining developmental stages that are not evidenced by change in size; such as the egg or pupa and where only a general time interval can be estimated based on the duration of the particular developmental stage. This is done by breaking the stages down into smaller units separated by predictable changed in [[gene expression]].&lt;ref name=Tarone&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tarone |first=Aaron M.  |authorlink= |author2=Jennings, Kimberley C.|author3=Foran, David R.  |date=November 2007 |title=Aging Blow Fly Eggs Using Gene Expression: A Feasibility Study |journal=Journal of Forensic Sciences |volume=52 |issue=6 |pages=1350–1354 |doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2007.00587.x  |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1556-4029.2007.00587.x |accessdate= 1 April 2008 |pmid=18093065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three genes were measured in an experiment with ''Drosophila melanogaster'': bicoid (bcd), slalom (sll), and chitin synthase (cs). These three genes were used because they are likely to be in varied levels during different times of the egg development process. These genes all share a linear relationship in regards to age of the egg; that is, the older the egg is the more of the particular gene is expressed.&lt;ref name=Tarone/&gt; However, all of the genes are expressed in varying amounts. Different genes on different loci would need to be selected for another fly species. The genes expressions are mapped in a control sample to formulate a developmental chart of the gene expression at certain time intervals. This chart can then be compared to the measured values of gene expression to accurately predict the age of an egg to within two hours with a high [[Confidence interval|confidence level]].&lt;ref name=Tarone/&gt; Even though this technique can be used to estimate the age of an egg, the feasibility and legal acceptance of this must be considered for it to be a widely utilized forensic technique.&lt;ref name=Tarone/&gt; One benefit of this would be that it is like other DNA-based techniques so most labs would be equipped to conduct similar experiments without requiring new capital investment. This style of age determination is in the process of being used to more accurately find the age of the instars and pupa; however, it is much more complicated, as there are more genes being expressed during these stages.&lt;ref name=Tarone/&gt; The hope is that with this and other similar techniques a more accurate PMI can be obtained.

==Insect activity case study==
A preliminary investigation of insect colonization and succession on remains in [[New Zealand]] revealed the following results on decay and insect colonization.&lt;ref name=Eberhardt&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eberhardt TL, Elliot DA | title=A preliminary investigation of insect colonisation and succession on remains in New Zealand | journal=Forensic Sci. Int. | year=2008 | volume=176 | issue=2–3 | pages=217–223 | pmid=17997065 | doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2007.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open field habitat===
This environment had a daily average maximum temperature of {{convert|19.4|C|F}} and a daily minimum temperature of {{convert|11.1|C|F}}. The average rainfall for the first 3 weeks in this environment was 3.0&amp;nbsp;mm/day. Around days 17–45, the body began to start active decay. During this stage, the insect successions started with ''[[Calliphora]] stygia'', which lasted until day 27. The larvae of ''[[Chrysomya rufifacies]]'' were present between the day 13 and day 47. ''[[Hydrotaea]] rostrata'', larvae of ''[[Lucilia sericata]]'', family [[Psychodidae]], and ''[[Sylvicola]]'' were found to be present relatively late in the body's decay.

===Coastal sand-dune habitat===
This environment had an average daily maximum temperature of {{convert|21.4|C|F}} and minimum of {{convert|13.5|C|F}}. The daily average rainfall was recorded as 1.4&amp;nbsp;mm/day for the first 3 weeks. The post-decay time interval, beginning at day six after death and ending around day 15 after death, is greatly reduced from the average post-decay time, due to the high average temperature of this environment. Insects obtained late in the post-active stage include the ''Calliphora quadrimaculata'', adult Sphaeroceridae, [[Psychodidae]] and [[Piophilidae]] (no larvae from this last family were obtained in recovery).

===Native bush habitat===
This environment had recorded daily average maximum and minimum temperatures were {{convert|18.0|C|F}} and {{convert|13.0|C|F}}, respectively. The average rainfall in this habitat was recorded at 0.4&amp;nbsp;mm/day. After the bloat stage, which lasted until day seven after death, post-active decay began around day 14. In this habitat, the ''H. rostrata'', adult [[Phoridae]], Sylvicola larvae and adult were the predominant species remaining on the body during the pre-[[skeletonization (forensics)|skeletonization]] stages.

==In literature==
Throughout its history the study of forensic entomology has not remained an esoteric science reserved only for entomologists and forensic scientists.
Early twentieth-century popular scientific literature began to pique a broader interest in [[entomology]]. The very popular ten-volume book series, Alfred Brehem’s ''Thierleben'' (Life of Animals, 1876–1879) expounded on many [[zoological]] topics, including [[arthropods]]. The accessible writing style of French entomologist [[Jean-Henri Fabre]] was also instrumental in the popularization of entomology. His collection of writings ''Souvenirs Entomologique'', written during the last half of the 19th century, is especially useful because of the meticulous attention to detail to the observed insects’ behaviors and life cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Benecke, M. (2001). A brief history of forensic entomology. Forensic Entomology International, 120, page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;“Jean Henri-Fabre.” Scarab Workers World Directory. January 1998 - January 2007.
University of Nebraska-Lincoln State Museum-Division of Entomology. 13 March 2008.  {{cite web |url=http://www.unl.edu/museum/research/entomology/workers/JFabre.htm |title=Jean Henri-Fabre|accessdate=2008-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212102902/http://www.unl.edu/museum/research/entomology/workers/JFabre.htm |archivedate=12 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The real impetus behind the modern cultural fascination with solving crime using entomological evidence can be traced back to the works ''Faune des Tombeaux'' (Fauna of the Tombs, 1887) and ''Les Faunes des Cadavres'' (Fauna of Corpses, 1894) by French [[veterinarian]] and [[entomologist]] [[Jean Pierre Mégnin]]. These works made the concept of the process of insect ecological succession on a corpse understandable and interesting to an ordinary reader in a way that no other previous scientific work had done. It was after the publication of Mégnin’s work that the studies of forensic science and entomology became an established part of Western popular culture, which in turn inspired other scientists to continue and expand upon his research.&lt;ref&gt;Benecke, M. (2001). A brief history of forensic entomology. Forensic Entomology International, 120, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[signal processing]], '''group delay''' is the time delay of the amplitude [[Envelope (waves)|envelopes]] of the various [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al [[Fourier series|components]] of a signal through a [[device under test]], and is a function of frequency for each component.  '''Phase delay''', in contrast, is the time delay of the ''phase'' as opposed to the time delay of the ''amplitude envelope''.

All frequency components of a signal are delayed when passed through a device such as an amplifier, a loudspeaker, or propagating through space or a medium, such as air. This signal delay will be different for the various frequencies unless the device has the property of being [[linear phase]] ("Linear phase" and [[minimum phase|"minimum phase"]] are often used interchangeably, but are actually quite different.) The delay variation means that signals consisting of multiple frequency components will suffer distortion because these components are not delayed by the same amount of time at the output of the device. This changes the shape of the signal in addition to any constant delay or scale change. A sufficiently large delay variation can cause problems such as poor [[High fidelity|fidelity]] in audio or [[intersymbol interference]] (ISI) in the [[demodulation]] of [[digital information]] from an [[analog signal|analog]] [[carrier signal]].  High speed [[modem]]s use [[adaptive equalizer]]s to compensate for non-constant group delay.

== Introduction ==
Group delay is a useful measure of time distortion, and is calculated by [[Derivative|differentiating]], with respect to frequency, the [[phase response]] of the device under test (DUT): the group delay is a measure of the slope of the phase response at any given frequency. Variations in group delay cause signal distortion, just as deviations from linear phase cause distortion.

In [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant (LTI) system theory]], [[control theory]], and in [[digital signal processing|digital]] or [[analog signal processing|analog]] [[signal processing]], the relationship between the input signal, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x(t)&lt;/math&gt;, to output signal, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, of an LTI system is governed by a [[convolution]] operation:

: &lt;math&gt; y(t)  = (h*x)(t) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(u) h(t-u) \, du  &lt;/math&gt;

Or, in the [[frequency domain]],

: &lt;math&gt; Y(s) = H(s) X(s)  \, &lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt; X(s)  =  \mathcal{L}\left \{ x(t) \right \} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int_{0}^{\infty} x(t) e^{-st}\, dt  &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; Y(s)  =  \mathcal{L}\left \{ y(t) \right \} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int_{0}^{\infty} y(t) e^{-st}\, dt &lt;/math&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt; H(s)  =  \mathcal{L}\left \{ h(t) \right \} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \int_{0}^{\infty} h(t) e^{-st}\, dt &lt;/math&gt;.

Here &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the time-domain [[impulse response]] of the LTI system and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle X(s)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle Y(s)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle H(s)&lt;/math&gt;, are the [[Laplace transform]]s of the input &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x(t)&lt;/math&gt;, output &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle y(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and impulse response &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h(t)&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.  &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle H(s)&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[transfer function]] of the LTI system and, like the impulse response &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle h(t)&lt;/math&gt;, ''fully'' defines the input-output characteristics of the LTI system.

Suppose that such a system is driven by a quasi-sinusoidal signal, that is, a [[Sine wave|sinusoid]] whose amplitude envelope &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle a(t)&lt;/math&gt; is slowly-changing relative to the frequency &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \omega&lt;/math&gt; of the sinusoid. Mathematically, this means that the driving signal has the form

: &lt;math&gt; x(t) = a(t) \cos(\omega t + \theta) \ &lt;/math&gt;

subject to the assumption

: &lt;math&gt; \left| \frac{d \log \left( a(t) \right)}{dt} \right| \ll \omega\;.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the output of such an LTI system is very well approximated as

: &lt;math&gt; y(t) = |H(i \omega)| \ a(t - \tau_g) \cos \left( \omega (t - \tau_\phi) + \theta \right) \; .&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tau_g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tau_\phi&lt;/math&gt;, the '''group delay''' and '''phase delay''' respectively, are given by the expressions below (and potentially are functions of the [[angular frequency]] &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \omega&lt;/math&gt;).

In a [[linear phase]] system (with non-inverting gain), both &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tau_g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tau_\phi&lt;/math&gt; are constant (i.e. independent of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \omega&lt;/math&gt;) and equal, and their common value equals the overall delay of the system; and the unwrapped [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]] of the system (namely &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle -\omega \tau_\phi&lt;/math&gt;) is negative, with magnitude increasing linearly with frequency &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \omega&lt;/math&gt;.

More generally, it can be shown that for an LTI system with transfer function &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle H(s)&lt;/math&gt; driven by a [[phasor|complex sinusoid]] of unit amplitude,

: &lt;math&gt; x(t) = e^{i \omega t} \ &lt;/math&gt;

the output is

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
 y(t) &amp; = H(i \omega) \ e^{i \omega t} \ \\
      &amp; = \left( |H(i \omega)| e^{i \phi(\omega)} \right) \ e^{i \omega t} \ \\
      &amp; = |H(i \omega)| \ e^{i \left(\omega t + \phi(\omega) \right)} \ \\
\end{align} \ &lt;/math&gt;

where the phase shift &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \phi&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt; \phi(\omega) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \arg \left\{ H(i \omega) \right\}  \;. &lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, it can be shown that the group delay, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tau_g&lt;/math&gt;, and phase delay, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \tau_\phi&lt;/math&gt;, are frequency-dependent, and they can be computed from the phase shift &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \phi&lt;/math&gt; by

: &lt;math&gt; \tau_g(\omega) = - \frac{d \phi(\omega)}{d \omega} \ &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \tau_\phi(\omega) = - \frac{\phi(\omega)}{\omega} \ &lt;/math&gt; .

== Group delay in optics ==
In [[physics]], and in particular in [[optics]], the term '''group delay''' has the following meanings:

:'''1.'''  The rate of change of the total phase shift with respect to [[angular frequency]], 
::&lt;math&gt; \tau_g = -\frac{d\phi}{d\omega}&lt;/math&gt;
:through a device or [[transmission medium]], where &lt;math&gt; \phi \ &lt;/math&gt; is the total phase shift in [[radian]]s, and &lt;math&gt;\omega \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] in [[radian]]s per unit time, equal to &lt;math&gt;2 \pi f \ &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; f \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[frequency]] ([[hertz]] if group delay is measured in seconds).

:'''2.'''  In an [[optical fiber]], the transit [[time]] required for optical [[Power (physics)|power]], traveling at a given [[Transverse mode|mode]]'s [[group velocity]], to travel a given distance.

:''Note:''  For optical fiber [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] measurement purposes, the quantity of interest is group [[Propagation delay|delay]] per unit length, which is the reciprocal of the group velocity of a particular mode. The measured group delay of a [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] through an optical fiber exhibits a [[wavelength]] dependence due to the various [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] mechanisms present in the fiber.

It is often desirable for the group delay to be constant across all frequencies; otherwise there is temporal smearing of the signal.  Because group delay is &lt;math&gt; \tau_g(\omega) = -\frac{d\phi}{d\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, as defined in (1), it therefore follows that a constant group delay can be achieved if the [[transfer function]] of the device or medium has a [[linear]] phase response (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\phi(\omega) = \phi(0) - \tau_g \omega \ &lt;/math&gt; where the group delay &lt;math&gt;\tau_g \ &lt;/math&gt; is a constant).
The degree of nonlinearity of the phase indicates the deviation of the group delay from a constant.

== Group delay in audio ==
Group delay has some importance in the audio field and especially in the sound reproduction field. Many components of an audio reproduction chain, notably [[loudspeakers]] and multiway loudspeaker [[Audio crossover|crossover networks]], introduce group delay in the audio signal. It is therefore important to know the threshold of audibility of group delay with respect to frequency, especially if the audio chain is supposed to provide [[high fidelity]] reproduction. The best thresholds of audibility table has been provided by {{Harvtxt|Blauert|Laws|1978}}.

Flanagan, Moore and Stone conclude that at 1, 2 and 4&amp;nbsp;kHz, a group delay of about 1.6 ms is audible with headphones in a non-reverberant condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Flanagan |first1=Sheila |last2=Moore |first2=Brian C.

==True time delay==
A transmitting apparatus is said to have '''true time delay''' ('''TTD''') if the time delay is independent of the [[frequency]] of the electrical signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=True Time Delay |publisher=Microwaves101, [[IEEE]] |url=http://www.microwaves101.com/microwave-encyclopedia/752-true-time-delay }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phase Delay and Group Delay |booktitle=Music 320 Background Reader |author=Julius O. Smith III |publisher=Department of Electrical Engineering, [[Stanford University]] |url=http://www.technick.net/public/code/cp_dpage.php?aiocp_dp=guide_dft_phase_delay_group }}&lt;/ref&gt; TTD is an important characteristic of lossless and low-loss, dispersion free, transmission lines. TTD allows for a wide instantaneous signal [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] with virtually no signal distortion such as pulse broadening during pulsed operation.

Harry Halbreich (obituary). ''[[Diapason (magazine)|Diapason]]'', September 2016, No.649, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
The son of a [[Jewish-German]] father and English mother, Halbreich studied with [[Arthur Honegger]] and later with [[Olivier Messiaen]] at the [[Paris Conservatoire]], gaining a first prize in analysis and history of music.&lt;ref name="diapason"/&gt; He later made his base in Belgium. From 1970 to 1976 he was Lecturer ({{lang-de|Dozent}}) in Musical Analysis at the Royal Conservatory in [[Mons]]. He worked on numerous radio broadcasts and co-founded the Belgian music magazine ''Crescendo'' for which he was a major contributor.&lt;ref name=Halb2007dust/&gt; From 1973 to 1976 he was artistic director of the Festival de Royan.&lt;ref name="diapason"/&gt;

He was known for a number of books, articles and studies on modern and contemporary music, including monograph works on [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Arthur Honegger]], and [[Bohuslav Martinů]]. He prepared musical catalogues of the works of Honegger and Martinů, and their works are therefore sometimes referred to by their '''H&amp;nbsp;number'''. He assisted Nicolas Bacri in orchestrating Honegger's [[opera]], ''La morte de Sainte Alméenne'', originally written in 1918 for voice and piano; the new version was premiered in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] on 26 November 2005, on the 50th anniversary of the composer's death.

Halbreich's interest in modern music led to him writing articles on composers including contemporary music, particularly [[Spectral music]]: [[Horațiu Rădulescu]], [[Iancu Dumitrescu]], [[Ana-Maria Avram]], [[Gérard Grisey]], and [[Tristan Murail]]. He has also written on composers of the past, including [[Edgard Varèse]], [[George Enescu]], [[Maurice Ohana]] as well as [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. A personal friend of contemporary performers and composers such as [[Iannis Xenakis]], [[Giacinto Scelsi]], [[György Ligeti]] and [[Witold Lutosławski]], he was a keen defender of younger composers.&lt;ref name="diapason"/&gt;

He had a broad interest in culture, and while a convert to Catholicism, he was open to, and expressed deep knowledge of eastern spiritual history alongside Christian mystics.&lt;ref name="diapason"/&gt;

He died on 27 June 2016 at the age of 85.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slippedisc.com/2016/06/death-of-h-number-musicologist/ Death of H-number musicologist]&lt;/ref&gt;
Of his three children, the eldest Frédéric is a painter.&lt;ref name="diapason"/&gt;

The '''High Power laser Energy Research facility''' ('''HiPER'''), is a proposed experimental laser-driven [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) device undergoing preliminary design for possible construction in the [[European Union]]. HiPER is the first experiment designed specifically to study the "fast ignition" approach to generating [[nuclear fusion]], which uses much smaller [[laser]]s than conventional designs, yet produces fusion power outputs of about the same magnitude. This offers a total "[[fusion gain]]" that is much higher than devices like the [[National Ignition Facility]] (NIF), and a reduction in construction costs of about ten times.

Theoretical research since the design of HiPER in the early 2000s has cast doubt on fast ignition as a route to practical ICF. A new approach known as ''shock ignition'' has been proposed to address some of these problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=LJ |last=Perkins |url=http://hifweb.lbl.gov/public/LLNL-LDRD-refs2009/Perkins-PRL09.pdf |title=Shock Ignition: A New Approach to High Gain Inertial Confinement Fusion on the National Ignition Facility |date=2009 |journal=Physical Review Letters|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.103.045004 |bibcode=2009PhRvL.103d5004P }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar ICF experimental setup in Japan was known as "HIPER", but this is no longer operational.

==Background==
{{main|inertial confinement fusion#ICF mechanism of action|l1=ICF mechanism}}
[[Inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) devices use "drivers" to rapidly heat the outer layers of a "target" to compress it. The target is a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]]. The heat of the laser burns the surface of the pellet into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], which explodes off the surface. The remaining portion of the target is driven inwards due to [[Newton's Third Law]], eventually collapsing into a small point of very high density. The rapid blowoff also creates a [[shock wave]] that travels towards the center of the compressed fuel. When it reaches the center of the fuel and meets the shock from the other side of the target, the energy in the shock wave further heats and compresses the tiny volume around it. If the temperature and density of that small spot can be raised high enough, fusion reactions will occur.&lt;ref name=how&gt;"[https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ How NIF works] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191346/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ |date=27 May 2010 }}", Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Retrieved on 2 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fusion reactions release high-energy particles, some of which (primarily [[alpha particle]]s) collide with the high density fuel around it and slow down. This heats the fuel further, and can potentially cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel—high enough density and temperature—this heating process can result in a [[chain reaction]], burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction. This is a condition known as "ignition", which can lead to a significant portion of the fuel in the target undergoing fusion, and the release of significant amounts of energy.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;Per F. Peterson, ''[http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/IFE.html Inertial Fusion Energy: A Tutorial on the Technology and Economics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927140724/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/IFE.html |date=27 September 2011 }}'', University of California, Berkeley, 1998. Retrieved on 7 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

To date most ICF experiments have used lasers to heat the targets. Calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly to compress the core before it disassembles, as well as creating a suitable shock wave. The energy must also be focused extremely evenly across the target's outer surface to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core. Although other "drivers" have been suggested, notably heavy ions driven in [[particle accelerator]]s, lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features.&lt;ref&gt;Per F. Peterson, ''[http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/target.html How IFE Targets Work] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617120937/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/target.html |date=17 June 2008 }}'', University of California, Berkeley, 1998.

==Description==
In the case of HiPER, the driver laser system is similar to existing systems like NIF, but considerably smaller and less powerful.

The driver consists of a number of "beamlines" containing [[Nd:glass laser]] amplifiers at one end of the building. Just prior to firing, the glass is [[laser pumping|"pumped"]] to a high-energy state with a series of [[xenon flash tube]]s, causing a [[population inversion]] of the [[neodymium]] (Nd) atoms in the glass. This readies them for amplification via [[laser|stimulated emission]] when a small amount of laser light, generated externally in a [[fibre optic]], is fed into the beamlines. The glass is not particularly effective at transferring power into the beam, so to get as much power as possible back out the beam is reflected through the glass four times in a mirrored cavity, each time gaining more power.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; When this process is complete, a [[Pockels cell]] "switches" the light out of the cavity.&lt;ref name=d147&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; One problem for the HiPER project is that Nd:glass is no longer being produced commercially, so a number of options need to be studied to ensure supply of the estimated 1,300 disks.&lt;ref name=d147/&gt;

From there, the laser light is fed into a very long [[spatial filter]] to clean up the resulting pulse. The filter is essentially a telescope that focuses the beam into a spot some distance away, where a small pinhole located at the focal point cuts off any "stray" light caused by inhomogeneities in the laser beam. The beam then widens out until a second lens returns it to a straight beam again. It is the use of spatial filters that lead to the long beamlines seen in ICF laser devices. In the case of HiPER, the filters take up about 50% of the overall length. The beam width at exit of the driver system is about 40&amp;nbsp;cm × 40&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the problems encountered in previous experiments, notably the [[Shiva laser]], was that the [[infrared]] light provided by the Nd:glass lasers (at ~1054&amp;nbsp;nm in ''vaco'') couples strongly with the [[electron]]s around the target, losing a considerable amount of energy that would otherwise heat the target itself. This is typically addressed through the use of an [[optical frequency multiplier]], which can double or triple the frequency of the light, into the green or [[ultraviolet]], respectively. These higher frequencies interact less strongly with the electrons, putting more power into the target. HiPER will use frequency tripling on the drivers.&lt;ref&gt;S. Atzeni, et al., [http://www.hiper-laser.org/pressandpr/journalarticles/atzeni_et_al_april2008.pdf "Fast ignitor target studies for the HiPER project"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205144210/http://www.hiper-laser.org/pressandpr/journalarticles/atzeni_et_al_april2008.pdf |date=5 December 2010 }}, ''Physics of Plasmas'', Vol. 15, 056311 (2008), {{doi|10.1063/1.2895447}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the amplification process is complete the laser light enters the experimental chamber, lying at one end of the building. Here it is reflected off a series of deformable mirrors that help correct remaining imperfections in the wavefront, and then feeds them into the target chamber from all angles. Since the overall distances from the ends of the beamlines to different points on the target chamber are different, delays are introduced on the individual paths to ensure they all reach the center of the chamber at the same time, within about 10&amp;nbsp;picoseconds (ps). The target, a fusion fuel pellet about 1&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter in the case of HiPER, lies at the center of the chamber.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt;

HiPER differs from most ICF devices in that it also includes a second set of lasers for directly heating the compressed fuel. The heating pulse needs to be very short, about 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;ps long, but this is too short a time for the amplifiers to work well. To solve this problem HiPER uses a technique known as ''[[chirped pulse amplification]]'' (CPA). CPA starts with a short pulse from a wide-bandwidth (multi-frequency) laser source, as opposed to the driver which uses a monochromatic (single-frequency) source. Light from this initial pulse is split into different colours using a pair of [[diffraction grating]]s and optical delays. This "stretches" the pulse into a chain several nanoseconds long. The pulse is then sent into the amplifiers as normal. When it exits the beamlines it is recombined in a similar set of gratings to produce a single very short pulse, but because the pulse now has very high power, the gratings have to be large (approx 1&amp;nbsp;m) and sit in a vacuum. Additionally the individual beams must be lower in power overall; the compression side of the system uses 40 beamlines of about 5&amp;nbsp;kJ each to generate a total of 200&amp;nbsp;kJ, whereas the ignition side requires 24 beamlines of just under 3&amp;nbsp;kJ to generate a total of 70&amp;nbsp;kJ. The precise number and power of the beamlines are currently a subject of research.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt; Frequency multiplication will also be used on the heaters, but it has not yet been decided whether to use doubling or tripling; the latter puts more power into the target, but is less efficient converting the light. As of 2007, the baseline design is based on doubling into the green.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fast Ignition and HiPER==
In traditional ICF devices the driver laser is used to compress the target to very high densities. The shock wave created by this process further heats the compressed fuel when it collides in the center of the sphere. If the compression is symmetrical enough the increase in temperature can create conditions close to the [[Lawson criterion]], leading to significant fusion energy production. If the resulting fusion rate is high enough, the energy released in these reactions will heat the surrounding fuel to similar temperatures, causing them to undergo fusion as well. In this case, known as "ignition", a significant portion of the fuel will undergo fusion and release large amounts of energy. Ignition is the basic goal of any fusion device.

The amount of laser energy needed to effectively compress the targets to ignition conditions has grown rapidly from early estimates. In the "early days" of ICF research in the 1970s it was believed that as little as 1&amp;nbsp;[[kilojoules]] (kJ) would suffice,&lt;ref&gt;Nuckolls et al., ''[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5368/pdf/239139a0.pdf Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications]'', ''Nature'' Vol. 239, 1972, pp. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, ''[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10126383-6NAuBK/native/10126383.pdf The Edward Teller Medal Lecture: The Evolution Toward Indirect Drive and Two Decades of Progress Toward ICF Ignition and Burn]'', 11th International Workshop on Laser Interaction and Related Plasma Phenomena, December 1994. Retrieved on 7 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of experimental lasers were built to reach these power levels. When they did, a series of problems, typically related to the homogeneity of the collapse, turned out to seriously disrupt the implosion symmetry and lead to much cooler core temperatures than originally expected. Through the 1980s the estimated energy required to reach ignition grew into the megajoule range, which appeared to make ICF impractical for fusion energy production. For instance, the [[National Ignition Facility]] (NIF) uses about 330&amp;nbsp;MJ of electrical power to pump the driver lasers, and in the best case is expected to produce about 20&amp;nbsp;MJ of fusion power output.&lt;ref name="how"/&gt; Without dramatic gains in output, such a device would never be a practical energy source.

The fast ignition approach attempts to avoid these problems. Instead of using the shock wave to create the conditions needed for fusion above the ignition range, this approach directly heats the fuel. This is far more efficient than the shock wave, which becomes less important. In HiPER, the compression provided by the driver is "good", but not nearly that created by larger devices like NIF; HiPER's driver is about 200&amp;nbsp;kJ and produces densities of about 300&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. That's about one-third that of NIF, and about the same as generated by the earlier [[NOVA laser]] of the 1980s. For comparison, lead is about 11&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, so this still represents a considerable amount of compression, notably when one considers the target's interior contained light D-T fuel around 0.1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=hiper&gt;Dunne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignition is started by a very-short (~10&amp;nbsp;picoseconds) ultra-high-power (~70&amp;nbsp;kJ, 4&amp;nbsp;PW) laser pulse, aimed through a hole in the plasma at the core. The light from this pulse interacts with the fuel, generating a shower of high-energy (3.5&amp;nbsp;MeV) relativistic electrons that are driven into the fuel. The electrons heat a spot on one side of the dense core, and if this heating is localised enough it is expected to drive the area well beyond ignition energies.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt;

The overall efficiency of this approach is many times that of the conventional approach. In the case of NIF the laser generates about 4&amp;nbsp;MJ of [[infrared]] power to create ignition that releases about 20&amp;nbsp;MJ of energy.&lt;ref name=how/&gt; This corresponds to a "fusion gain" —the ratio of input laser power to output fusion power— of about 5. If one uses the baseline assumptions for the current HiPER design, the two lasers (driver and heater) produce about 270&amp;nbsp;kJ in total, yet generate 25 to 30&amp;nbsp;MJ, a gain of about 100.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt; Considering a variety of losses, the actual gain is predicted to be around 72.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt; Not only does this outperform NIF by a wide margin, the smaller lasers are much less expensive to build as well. In terms of power-for-cost, HiPER is expected to be about an [[order of magnitude]] less expensive than conventional devices like NIF.

Compression is already a fairly well-understood problem, and HiPER is primarily interested in exploring the precise physics of the rapid heating process. It is not clear how quickly the electrons stop in the fuel load; while this is known for matter under normal pressures, it's not for the ultra-dense conditions of the compressed fuel. To work efficiently, the electrons should stop in as short a distance as possible, to release their energy into a small spot and thus raise the temperature (energy per unit volume) as high as possible.

How to get the laser light onto that spot is also a matter for further research. One approach uses a short pulse from another laser to heat the plasma outside the dense "core", essentially burning a hole through it and exposing the dense fuel inside. This approach will be tested on the [[Laboratory for Laser Energetics|OMEGA-EP]] system in the US. Another approach, tested successfully on the [[GEKKO XII]] laser in Japan, uses a small gold cone that cuts through a small area of the target shell; on heating no plasma is created in this area, leaving a hole that can be aimed into by shining the laser into the inner surface of the cone. HiPER is currently planning on using the gold cone approach, but will likely study the burning solution as well.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt;

==Current status==
{{Update|section|date=December 2013}}
In 2005 HiPER completed a preliminary study outlining possible approaches and arguments for its construction. The report received positive reviews from the EC in July 2007, and moved onto a preparatory design phase in early 2008 with detailed designs for construction beginning in 2011 or 2012.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

In parallel, the HiPER project also proposes to build smaller laser systems with higher repetition rates. The high-powered flash lamps used to pump the laser amplifier glass causes it to deform, and it cannot be fired again until it cools off, which takes as long as a day. Additionally only a very small amount of the flash of white light generated by the tubes is of the right frequency to be absorbed by the Nd:glass and thus lead to amplification, in general only about 1 to 1.5% of the energy fed into the tubes ends up in the laser beam.&lt;ref&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Key to avoiding these problems is replacing the flash lamps with more efficient pumps, typically based on [[laser diode]]s. These are far more efficient at generating light from electricity, and thus run much cooler. More importantly, the light they do generate is fairly monochromatic and can be tuned to frequencies that can be easily absorbed. This means that much less power needs to be used to produce any particular amount of laser light, further reducing the overall amount of heat being generated. The improvement in efficiency can be dramatic; existing experimental devices operate at about 10% overall efficiency, and it is believed "near term" devices will improve this as high as 20%.&lt;ref name=design&gt;Dunne, 2007, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

HiPER proposes to build a demonstrator diode-pump system producing 10&amp;nbsp;kJ at 1&amp;nbsp;Hz or 1&amp;nbsp;kJ at 10&amp;nbsp;Hz depending on a design choice yet to be made. The best high-repetition lasers currently operating are much smaller; [[Mercury laser|Mercury]] at [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|Livermore]] is about 70&amp;nbsp;J, HALNA in Japan at ~20&amp;nbsp;J, and LUCIA in France at ~100&amp;nbsp;J. HiPER's demonstrator would thus be between 10 and 500 times as powerful as any of these.&lt;ref name=hiper/&gt;

To make a practical commercial power generator, the high-gain of a device like HiPER would have to be combined with a high-repetition rate laser and a target chamber capable of extracting the power.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Additional areas of research for post-HiPER devices include practical methods to carry the heat out of the target chamber for power production, protecting the device from the [[neutron]] flux generated by the fusion reactions, and the production of [[tritium]] from this flux to produce more fuel for the reactor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8544">'''Hydraulic redistribution''' refers to the mechanism by which some [[vascular plant]]s redistribute soil water. It occurs in vascular plants that commonly have roots in both wet soil and extremely dry soil, especially plants with both [[taproot]]s that grow vertically down to the [[water table]], and [[lateral roots]] that sit close to the surface.

==Process==
Hot, dry periods, when the surface soil dries out to the extent that the lateral roots exude whatever water they contain, will result in the death of such lateral roots unless the water is replaced. Similarly, under extreme wet conditions when lateral roots are inundated by flood waters, oxygen deprivation will also lead to root peril. In plants that exhibit hydraulic redistribution, there are [[xylem]] pathways from the taproots to the laterals, such that the absence or abundance of water at the laterals creates a pressure potential analogous to that of [[transpirational pull]]. In drought conditions, [[ground water]] is drawn up through the taproot to the laterals and exuded into the surface soil, replenishing that which was lost. Under flooding conditions, plant roots perform a similar function in the opposite direction. For a visualization of this process, see [https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230601/http://dawsonlab.synthasite.com/resources/Hydraulic%20Redistribution%20Cartoon.JPG "Hydraulic Redistribution Cartoon," Dawson Lab, UC Berkeley, CA]

Though often referred to as '''hydraulic lift''', movement of water by the plant roots has been shown to occur in any direction.&lt;ref&gt;S.S.O. Burgess, M.A. Adams, N.C. Turner, C.R. Beverly, C.K. Ong, A.A.H. Khan, and T.M.

Smart, E. Carlisle, M. Goebel, and B.A. Nunez (2005), Transverse hydraulic redistribution by a grapevine, Plant, Cell and Environment, 28, 157-166&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon has been documented in over sixty plant species spanning a variety of plant types (from herb and grasses to shrubs and trees)&lt;ref name="Oliveira 2005"&gt;R.S.

Caldwell (1990), Water parasitism stemming from hydraulic lift: a quantitative test in the field, Israeli Journal of Botany, 39, 395-402&lt;/ref&gt; and over a range of environmental conditions (from the Kalahari Desert to the Amazon Rainforest).&lt;ref name="Oliveira 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawson 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess Bleby 2006"&gt;S.S.O. Burgess and T.M. Bleby (2006), Redistribution of soil water by lateral roots mediated by stem tissues, Journal of Experimental Botany, 57:12, 3283-3291&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulze et al. 1998"&gt;E.D. Schulze, M.M. Caldwell, J. Canadell, H.A. Mooney, R.B. Jackson, D. Parson, R. Scholes, O.E. Sala and P. Trimborn (1998), Downward flux of water through roots (i.e. inverse hydraulic lift) in dry Kalahari sands, Oecologia, 115, 460-462&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The movement of this water can be explained by the theory of water transport through a plant.  This well established theory is called the [[cohesion-tension theory]].   In brief, it states that movement of water through the plant depends on having a continuous column of water, from the roots to the leaves.  Water is then pulled from the roots to the leaves, through the plant system, by the difference in water potential between the [[boundary layer]]s of the [[soil]] and the [[atmosphere]].  Therefore, the driving force for moving water through a plant is the cohesive strength of water molecules and a pressure gradient from the roots to the leaves.  This theory can still be applied when the boundary layer to the atmosphere is closed, e.g. when [[plant]] [[stomata]] are closed or in senesced plants.&lt;ref&gt;A.J. Leffler, M.S. Peek, R.J. Ryel, C.Y. Ivans, and M.M. Caldwell (2005), Hydraulic redistribution through the root systems of senesced plants, Ecology, 86, 633-642&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure gradient is between soil layers with different water potentials; water moves through the roots from wetter to drier soil layers in the same manner as it does when the plant is transpiring.

==Significance==
The [[ecological]] importance of hydraulically redistributed water is becoming better understood as this phenomenon is more carefully examined.  Water redistribution by plant roots has been found influencing crop irrigation, where watering schemes leave a harsh heterogeneity in soil moisture.  The plant roots have been shown to smooth or homogenize the soil moisture.  This sort of smoothing out of soil moisture is important in maintaining plant root health.  The redistribution of water from deep moist layers to shallow drier layers by large trees has shown to increase the moisture available in the daytime to meet the transpiration demand.

The implications of hydraulic redistribution seem to have an important influence on plant [[ecosystem]]s.  Whether or not plants redistribute water through the soil layers can affect plant [[population dynamics]], such as the facilitation of neighboring species.&lt;ref&gt;M.M. Caldwell, T.E. Dawson, and J.H. Richards (1998), Hydraulic lift: consequences of water efflux from the roots of plants, Oecologia, 113, 151-161&lt;/ref&gt;  The increase in available daytime soil moisture can also offset low transpiration rates due to drought (''see also [[drought rhizogenesis]]'') or alleviate competition for water between competing plant species.  Water redistributed to the near surface layers may also influence plant nutrient availability.&lt;ref&gt;R.J. Ryel, M.M. Caldwell, C.K. Yoder, D. Or, and A.J. Leffler (2002), Hydraulic redistribution in a stand of ''Artemisia tridentata'': evaluation of benefits to transpiration assessed with a simulation model, Oecologia, 130, 173-184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observations and modeling==
Due to the ecological significance of hydraulically redistributed water, there is an ongoing effort to continue the categorization of plants exhibiting this behaviour and adapting this physiological process into land-surface models to improve model predictions.

Traditional methods of observating hydraulic redistribution include Deuterium isotope traces,&lt;ref name="Smart et al. 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawson 1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schulze et al. 1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Brooks, F.C. Meinzer, R. Coulombe, and J. Gregg (2002), Hydraulic redistribution of soil water during summer drought in two contrasting Pacific Northwest coniferous forests, Tree Physiology, 20, 909-913&lt;/ref&gt; sap flow,&lt;ref name="Oliveira 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess Bleby 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.S.O. Burgess, M.A. Adams, N.C. Turner, and K.C. Ong (1998), The redistribution of soil water by tree root systems, Oecologia, 115, 306-311&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F.C. Meinzer, S.A. James, and G. Goldstein (2004), Dynamics of transpiration, sap flow and use of stored water in tropical canopy trees, Tree Physiology, 24, 901-909&lt;/ref&gt; and soil moisture.&lt;ref name="Richards Caldwell 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawson 1993"/&gt; In attempts to characterize the magnitude of the water redistributed, numerous models (both empirically and theoretically based) have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;R.B.

The '''Institute for International Law of Peace and Armed Conflict''' (IFHV) at [[Ruhr University Bochum]] (Germany) is one of the leading research institutes on [[humanitarian law]] and [[humanitarian studies]] in Europe.

It was founded in 1988 on the initiative of Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. mult. Knut Ipsen, then rector of Ruhr University Bochum, as a means to conduct research on international conflicts and provide solutions to resolve them. The IFHV’s research is highly interdisciplinary with a focus on international humanitarian studies from a legal and social-scientific perspective.

The Institute also provides high-level academic and professional training for the next generation of personnel in the area of humanitarian action. The IFHV’s interdisciplinary angle is put into practice through its Joint Master’s Programme in International Humanitarian Action, part of the [[European University Network on Humanitarian Assistance]] (NOHA).

Since 2014, the Institute is headed by Prof. Dr. Pierre Thielbörger, M.PP. ([[Harvard]]). Its staff consists of about 25 employees (including student research assistants) and about 10 PhD students.

Current professors involved in the Institute’s work are: 
* Prof. Dr. Dennis Dijkzeul (IFHV)

The '''Institute of Marine Sciences''' ('''IMS''') focuses on marine science-related education and research. IMS was founded in 1975 on the Erdemli Campus at [[METU]] ([[Middle East Technical University]]) in [[Erdemli]] / [[Mersin]]. Institute’s campus at Erdemli, houses laboratories, office buildings,  computing and remote sensing facilities, a library, an atmospheric tower, and other services. Housing for staff and students, and harbor facility are also located on the campus.
==Location==
Although the main campus of METU is in Ankara the institute was esatablished in Mersin Province , a Mediterranean Sea |Mediterranean province of Turkey. It is at {{coord|36|40|01|N|34|15|18|E}} &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haritamap.com/yer/odtu-deniz-bilimleri-enstitusu-erdemli Map page]&lt;/ref&gt; in Limonlu (lamas of the antiquity ) town of Erdemli ilçe (district) Its distance Erdemli is {{convert|10|km}} and to Mersin is {{convert|47|km}}.
==History==
The institute was founded in 1975 as a part of Chemistry school . Two years later it moved to its current location which was allocated by the government. Up to present the institute had eight directors: Turgut İsmail Balkaş, Teoman Nuriddin Norman, Ümit Ünlüata, İlkay Salihoğlu, Şükrü Turan Beşiktepe, Ferit Bingel, Ahmet Kıydeş, and currently Barış Salihoğlu. The total number of MS graduates is 99 and the Phd gradıuates is 31.&lt;ref name="HT"/&gt;In its brief history, research accomplished by the Institute has resulted both in vastly increasing our knowledge of the seas surrounding Turkey and in establishing a data base to help in the management of Marine Environment. During more than 30 years Institute had tens of projects

==The 	infrastructure ==
Total area of the Institute is about {{convert|0.66|km2}} and it is divided by the Turkish state highway {{TUR-D|400}} between Mersin and Antalya  Most of the buildings are to the south of the high way (sea side) . &lt;ref name="HT"&gt;[http://ims2.metu.edu.tr/history-0 METU history page]&lt;/ref&gt;The northern part is composed of mediterranean type scrub and an abandoned stone pit (Used during the construction of Mersin Harbor)
== Education ==

The Institute has four main divisions: 

[http://www.ims.metu.edu.tr/index.asp?doc=branches/chemic.htm/ Chemical Oceanography]

[http://www.ims.metu.edu.tr/index.asp?doc=branches/biol.htm/ Marine Biology and Fisheries]

[http://www.ims.metu.edu.tr/index.asp?doc=branches/geol.htm/ Marine Geology and Geophysics]

[https://web.archive.org/web/20070721220401/http://www.ims.metu.edu.tr/departments/PhyWeb/Physical_oceaonography.html Physical Oceanography]

The programs are envisioned to provide scientists of future with through education and training in their fields. Special emphasis is given to studying the national marine environment, in keeping with the Institute of Marine Sciences’ objectives of developing and improving the marine resources of Turkey.

Students with B.S. degree (or equivalent) in one of the natural sciences or engineering, and a background including statistics and differential equations, calculus may apply.

== Research ==

Institute owns three research vessels: a 433 gross tons research vessel, RV/Bilim, which is utilized for ocean research, including fisheries, and two smaller vessels of 16 m length (the Lamas and the Erdemli) for daily trips in the near shore regions.

== R/V Bilim 2==
{{main|RV Bilim-2}}
[[File:RV-Bilim 2.jpg|150px|left]]

Institute of Marine Sciences' main research ship,  "Bilim 2's" designs were donated by the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], La Jolla, CA., which were at the time were blueprints of their R/V Alpha Helix [http://www.sfos.uaf.edu/helix/]. It was built in Istanbul, and launched in 1983. Steel hull, Length: 40.36 m, Beam: 9.47 m, Tonnage: 433 gross, 190 net tons, Draft: 3.80 m, Speed: {{convert|11.5|kn|km/h|0}} max, {{convert|9.5|kn|km/h|0}} cruising, {{convert|1.0|kn|km/h|0|sing=on}} min, Range: {{convert|6500|mi|km|-1}}, Propulsion: MWM diesel, {{Convert|820|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, variable-pitch propeller, Schafran bridge control unit, fuel capacity 120 m3. A Global Positioning System (GPS) is used for navigation. The vessel also has conventional radar with {{convert|60|mi|km|0}} range. The ship has central partial air conditioning and central heating. 

The R/V Bilim 2 has quarters for a crew of 12, and can support a scientific party of 14 for a period of about 45 days at sea. 

Physical and chemical data on board of the Bilim are obtained utilizing a Sea-Bird Model 9 CTD profiling system together with a General Oceanics rosette sampler having 12 bottles of 5 liter volume. The CTD and the rosette are operated using a Lebus hydrographic winch with a 2000 m cable. For on-board analyses an automatic Winkler titration system, an auto-analyzer, an in-situ spectrofluorometer, an irradiance meter as well as other instruments are available.

The vessel is fully equipped for fisheries and marine biological studies. Some of the major equipment for these investigations are a Norlau hydraulic trawl winch of 7.5 tons and 2 X 1500 m wire capacity, a hydraulic net winch of 6 ton capacity.

Marine geological investigations are carried out using an EG&amp;G Uniboom shallow seismic system, side-scan sonars, and various corers. An underwater remotely operated camera (Mini Rover Benthos MK II) is also utilized in sea floor surveys.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32317">'''International''' or '''global psychology''' is an emerging branch of [[psychology]] that focuses on the worldwide enterprise of psychology in terms of communication and networking, cross-cultural comparison, [[scholarship]], practice, and pedagogy (Stevens &amp; Gielen, 2007). Often, the terms international psychology, global psychology, and cross-cultural psychology are used interchangeably, but their purposes are subtly and importantly different: Global means worldwide, international means across and between nations, cross-cultural means across cultures. In contrast, the term “multicultural” is more often used to refer to ethnic and other [[Cultural identity|cultural differences]] existing within a given nation rather than to global or international comparisons.

== Definitions and scope==
International psychology is concerned with the emergence and practice of psychology in different parts of the [[world]] (Stevens &amp; Gielen, 2007). It advocates committed involvement in worldwide and regional psychology and policy-making organizations such as the [[International Union of Psychological Science]] (IUPsyS includes 87 national psychology associations and more than 20 international/regional associations), the International Association of [[Applied psychology|Applied Psychology]] (IAAP), the International Association of Cross-Cultural Psychology (IACCP), the [[icpweb.org|International Council of Psychologists]] (ICP), the European Federation of Psychologists’ Associations (EFPA: it includes 36 national psychology associations), the Sociedad Interamericana de Psicología (SIP), the recently founded Pan-African Psychological Union (PAPU), and others. In addition, there exist more than 100 international psychology organizations each focusing on a specific subdiscipline. The goal is to establish psychology as a global discipline that in its theories, research practices, applications, and ethical aspirations is focused on the psychological study of humanity as a whole while avoiding as much as possible ethnocentric biases and preoccupations (McCormick &amp; Constantable, 2015; Stevens &amp; Wedding, 2004). For an annotated bibliography on international psychology that covers 156 publications, see Takooshian, Gielen, Rich, and Velayo (2016). 

In contrast, the term “global psychology” is more frequently used to refer to the worldwide investigation of global issues and phenomena from a  psychological and psychocultural point of view. Examples include the investigation of subjective well being, identification and treatment of [[mental health]] problems, the psychological dimensions of family systems, [[gender role]]s and gender-typed behavior, [[childrearing]] practices, cognitive and emotional functioning, international attitudes, [[value system]]s, intergroup conflicts, threats to the natural environment, societal transformation and national development, the struggles of disempowered groups (such as women, children, immigrants, and refugees) as seen in a global perspective (Stevens &amp; Gielen, 2007).

Cross-cultural psychology may be defined as the comparative study of behavior and mental processes in different cultures. It aims to measure the psychological phenomena across cultures and looks for patterns, generalizability, and culture-specific differentiation (Shiraev &amp; Levy, 2013). An example would be the investigation of child-rearing practices and their psychological consequences among distinctly different groups.  Cross-cultural psychology focuses on the relationship between psychology and culture (such as language, traditions, predominant values, and socialization practices) and how it affects individual human functioning. In this respect, cross-cultural psychology constitutes one important element of global psychology. Cross-cultural psychology emerged during the 1960s-1970s as a separate [[Science|field of study]] with a definite identity; it is thus older than the more general field of international psychology, which is only now emerging as a distinct discipline.

[[The Oxford English Dictionary]] (1993) defines global as, “…pertaining to or involving the world, worldwide” (p.&amp;nbsp;1101) and international as, “Existing, occurring, or carried on between nations…Agreed on by many nations; used by, or able to be used by (the people of) many nations” (p.&amp;nbsp;1397). At present the term international psychology is in wider use although Stevens and Gielen (2007) prefer the term global psychology, to underline the increasingly global nature of psychological phenomena and problems together with their [[Scientific method|scientific investigation]] and efforts to ameliorate them. More generally, the emergence and intensification of an international psychology movement is part and parcel of the broader process of globalization in the scientific, economic, technological, sociocultural, political and ecological spheres. It reflects and makes use of the increasingly global flow of information, ideas, and peoples. In addition, globalization in psychology has led to the ''de facto'' use of English as the predominant means of communication so that academics in many parts of the world are now expected to read and publish in English-language journals.

It should be added that international psychology, global psychology, and cross-cultural psychology share the common goal of making psychology more universal and less ethnocentric in character. Because American psychologists dominated the field of psychology especially in the decades after World War II, they frequently ignored contributions from other parts of the world and claimed, whether explicitly or implicitly, that their theories, concepts, ethical standards, and empirical findings applied to all—or at least most—people around the world. In addition, because they largely ignored books and journals not written in English, American psychology became a largely monocultural and monolinguistic discipline (Draguns, 2001). Consequently, it is a key goal of internationally oriented psychologists both in the US and elsewhere to turn psychology into a more universally and less culturally biased discipline that contributes to human welfare everywhere while strengthening "world consciouness" rather than ethnocentric and potentially violent forms of nationalism or extremist religious preoccupations (Leong, Pickren, Leach, &amp; Marsella, 2012). Practical advice about how to internationalize the teaching of psychology can be found in the handbook by Rich, Gielen, and Takooshian (2017).

== Foci ==
Major foci of international psychology include:

* The worldwide study of psychological processes and phenomena (e.g., Gielen, 2016; Hofstede, 2001).
* Macro-level interventions and policy making, for example, international efforts to reduce [[HIV|HIV infections]] based on psychological research (Wessells &amp; Dawes, 2007), to assess and reduce ethnic conflicts (Landis &amp; Albert, 2013), and to further global mental health (Patel, Minas, Cohen, &amp; Prince, 2014).
* Micro-level interventions, for example, counseling and psychotherapy, [[school psychology]], and interventions in organizations (e.g., Aycan, Kanungo, &amp; Mendonça, 2014; Moodley, Gielen, &amp; Wu, 2013; Pedersen, Lonner, Draguns, &amp; Trimble, 2015).
* International networking and international psychology organizations and conferences, such as IUPsyS, IAAP, IACCP, EFPA, SIP, APA’s Division 52 – International Psychology, APA's Office of International Affairs, and the [[Institute for International and Cross-Cultural Psychology]] (IICCP) (Merenda, 1995).
* Supporting efforts to internationalize psychology education by infusing global, international, and cultural perspectives into the curriculum, providing international and cross-cultural training experiences, increasing international faculty and student exchange, and forming collaborative research programs (Heine, 2016; Leong et al., 2012; McCarthy, Dickson, Cranney, Trapp, &amp; Karandashev, 2012; Rich &amp; Gielen, 2015; Rich, Gielen, &amp; Takooshian, 2017; Takooshian, Gielen, Plous, Rich, &amp; Velayo, 2016). 
* Rewriting the [[history of psychology]] from a global and less ethnocentric point of view, together with corresponding changes in the curriculum (Baker, 2012; Brock, 2007; Leong et al., 2012; Rich &amp; Gielen, 2015; Takooshian, Gielen, Plous, Rich, &amp; Velayo, 2016).
* Establishing shared training standards, professional regulations, and codes of [[ethics]] (Pettifor, 2007; Leach, Stevens, Lindsay, Ferrero, &amp; Korkut, 2012), such as the Universal Declaration of Ethical Principles for Psychologists (2008), which has been adopted by the IUPsyS and its 87 national member organizations (Leach, Stevens, Lindsay, Ferrero, &amp; Korkut, 2012).
* Representing psychology at the United Nations especially in the context of non-governmental organizations (NGO's). An important step in this regard was taken in 2012, when The Psychology of NGOs Accredited at the United Nations (PCUN) was established by a group of psychology-based NGOs. These NGOs advocate for the inclusion of psychological perspectives, research, and practice, for instance when formulating and implementing the UN's [[Sustainable Development Goals]].
*Based in part on the advocacy of psychologists such as Judy Kuriansky, Chair of the Psychology Coalition of NGOs at the United Nations, mental health and well-being have for the first time been included in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Supported by the World Bank Group and the World Health Organization (2016), mental health specialists are now succeeding in moving mental health issues from the periphery closer to the center of worldwide efforts to improve global health.

==History==

Modern scientific psychology had an international dimension from its beginnings in the late 19th century. [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1832-1920), for instance, the father of modern experimental psychology, supervised approximately 190 doctoral students from at least 10 countries. Similarly, the First International Congress of Physiological Psychology in 1889, in [[Paris]], included more than 200   participants from 20 countries (Sabourin &amp; Cooper, 2014). Although psychology developed first in [[Europe]], it soon began to prosper in the [[United States]] as well. Altogether, modern scientific psychology remained a predominantly western enterprise till well after [[World War II]] although modern psychology was already present in the early 1900s some in nonwestern countries such as India, Japan, and Mexico. During the 1930s many prominent psychologists from Germany and Austria emigrated to the United States. As a result of these developments, psychology in the United States assumed worldwide leadership, but also grew increasingly monocultural, monolingual, and ethnocentric in character (see David and Buchanan, 2003, and Bullock, 2012, for timelines of important events in the history of international psychology). However, there is now an increased awareness among U.S. psychologists that U.S. psychology must take into account global developments in order to fully represent the world of psychology. For instance, the [[American Psychological Association]] established in 1997 an International Psychology Division (Division 52), which currently has about 600 members.

During the last three to four decades, especially, psychology has expanded worldwide and assumed a global presence. Stevens and Gielen (2007) and some others have estimated that there are over one million psychologists.  This estimate is based on local definitions of what it means to be a professional psychologist: in most countries the prerequisite is a [[Master's degree]] or Diploma in psychology, whereas in others (e.g., Brazil) a professionally oriented [[Bachelor’s degree]] that incorporates a period of supervised practice enable one to gain admission to a licensing examination. The global estimate includes well over 320,000 psychologists in Europe, at least 250,000 in Latin America, and 225,000 in the United States. The country with the highest density of psychologists is Argentina. In addition, psychology has gained ground in East and [[Southeast Asia]] and is increasingly visible in [[Majority Muslim countries|Muslim countries]] such as [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Iran]], and [[Lebanon]] (Ahmed &amp; Gielen, 1998; Baker, 2012; Stevens &amp; Wedding, 2004). In [[sub-Saharan Africa]], psychology is well developed in [[South Africa]], but less present though expanding in the other regions.  For more detailed information, see the edited volume by Stevens and Wedding (2004) which  includes analyses of the status of psychology in 27 [[countries]] located on all inhabited [[continents]]. The handbook by Baker (2012) reviews the respective histories of psychology in 27 countries and regions around the world while the volume by Rich and Gielen (2015) focuses on 17 past and present pathfinders in the realm of international psychology. The contributions respectively to Moodley, Gielen, and Wu (2013) and Gerstein et al. (2009) analyze the status of counseling psychology and psychotherapy in numerous countries.

In general, psychology as a discipline has prospered in well-to-do, urbanized, and individualistic countries and cultures but it is frequently considered an unnecessary luxury in the poorer and more rural regions of the world where the treatment of physical health problems by modern healthcare workers and indigenous healers is likely to take precedence over the identification and treatment of [[mental health]] problems (Leung &amp; Zhang, 1995; O'Gorman, Shum, Halford, &amp; Ogilvie, 2012). Such problems are frequently treated by indigenous healers who tend to rely on supernatural explanations for their identification and treatment. However, a global mental health movement that has been strongly influenced by psychiatrists is gathering steam. This makes it likely that in the future, greater resources will be allocated to mental health problems especially in medium-income countries (Patel et al., 2014). Countries where psychology is both influential and especially well developed include The Netherlands, Switzerland, Israel, Germany, USA, United Kingdom, Australia, Indonesia, Austria, the Scandinavian countries, and Argentina (especially psychoanalysis).

== Trends ==

Perhaps the best measure of trends within international psychology is within its organizations, through new membership, conference topics, and cooperative research across borders. For example, the International Union of [[Psychological science|Psychological Science]] (IUPsyS) has seen an increase of new member countries from [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Eastern Europe]], and [[Latin America]] in the past 15 years; membership in such organizations represents a desire and need in these countries for networking, training, accreditation, expansion of scientific research, and international recognition (Stevens &amp; Gielen, 2007). Correspondingly, international psychology conferences are now increasingly taking place in both Western and non-Western countries. IUPSyS's quadrennial International Congresses of Psychology (ICP), for instance, have been and will be taking place in Beijing (2004), Berlin (2008), Cape Town (2012), Yokohama (2016), and Prague (2020). Similarly, the quadrennial Congresses of Applied Psychology offered by IAAP, the largest international psychology organization for individual members, have taken or will take place around the globe in cities such as San Francisco (1998), Singapore (2002), Athens (2006), Melbourne (2010), Paris (2014), and Montreal (2018).

Trends in global psychology point to the sustained growth, specialization, and feminization of psychology, and the emergence of contextually sensitive paradigms.

The number of psychologists, psychology students, and psychology programs worldwide continues to grow steadily, proving that one of the goals of globalization is being met.  However, much work still needs to be done to bring psychology to underdeveloped areas, and to increase the resources and development of the field in countries where it has already taken hold (Adair &amp; Kağitçibaşi, 1995; Stevens &amp; Wedding, 2004).

Specialization is a growing trend, with each nation focusing specializations on its own needs and goals. Also, communication within these specializations is being facilitated through the [[World Wide Web]] and the emergence and growth of specialized [[international organization]]s and journals in subfields of psychology. Although access to the Internet is frequently still limited in [[Developing country|low-income countries]], it has nevertheless improved considerably in recent years thus facilitating the exchange of scientific and professional information as well as research data. The ''Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology'', for instance, is increasingly publishing papers by large teams of international psychologists that compare psychological phenomena across numerous countries located on all inhabited continents. Moreover, high impact psychological journals published in North America and Europe have broadened their scope by increasingly accepting articles by international and non-Western authors including those residing in East Asian countries. 

Feminization in psychology is another trend, as women are beginning to dominate the field in Europe, Latin America, Canada, the United States, and parts of Asia. A trend within this trend is the continued dominance of male psychologists within business and academia, whereas women tend to work more frequently in school, counseling, and clinical settings.

Finally, with the globalization of psychology comes the demand for more culturally sensitive paradigms (Heine, 2016). Traditionally, psychology was taught in the Western context, reflecting the norms, values, and data of those particular regions. Increasing awareness that this psychology does not sufficiently address culturally specific as well as global issues and therefore does not fully apply to some cultures has led to the call for indigenous psychologies, or at least an alternative psychology to the mainstream, reductionistic paradigm which may be applied to most, if not all, cultures (Kim, Yang, &amp; Hwang, 2006). Prominent centers of [[indigenous psychology]] include Mexico, the Philippines, [[South Korea]], and Taiwan. Moreover, the increasing inclusion of globally collected data of psychological relevance is gradually undermining the traditionally ethnocentric nature of psychology as taught in the United States and elsewhere in the West (e.g., Hofstede, 2001). Theoretically, indigenous psychologists emphasizing culturally sensitive paradigms tend to see themselves as cultural rather than as cross-cultural psychologists.

== Professional regulations and ethical standards ==

Many countries around the world have professional regulations for the practice of psychology. “With some exceptions, the existence of professional regulation reflects the level of development of professional psychology in that country. A profession needs to establish an identity and credibility before there is something to be regulated” (Pettifor, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;312). In the 36 European countries represented in EFPA, a major effort is underway to unify the basic academic curriculum as well as other requirements underlying the training and certification of psychologists. These countries have established specific yet wide ranging guidelines for a European [[Diploma]] in Psychology comparable to a Master’s level [[Higher education|university education]] of six years duration that includes supervised practice. The diploma will enable psychologists trained in one country to practice in other European countries and is likely to influence the education and practice of psychologists in other parts of the world as well.

Countries that currently have limited or no regulation of the profession include [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Japan]], [[Kenya]], [[Kuwait]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]] and [[Turkey]]. Several of these countries are working toward licensing legislation, and several have developed ethical standards of practice to guide.
Many national psychology associations have adopted a [[Ethical code|code of ethics]] such as, for instance, APA’s Ethical Principles of Psychologists and [[Code of Conduct]]. EFPA has adopted several codes of ethics in recent years, and the five [[Nordic countries]] (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden) adopted a unified code of ethics in 1988, which they revised in 1998 to be more consistent with EFPA’s meta-code (Pettifor, 2007). Moreover, IUPsyS and IAAP adopted, in 2008, a Universal Declaration of Ethical Principles for Psychologists. Such codes and declarations tend to be aspirational in nature.

== Conclusion ==

The scope of scientific psychology and its practice have expanded enormously from its early beginnings in the 19th century to today. This holds true for all post-industrial countries and increasingly for some modernizing nations such as Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, and Turkey. In contrast, psychology remains much less visible in the poorer countries and especially so in their rural areas. The expansion of psychology into the nonwestern world has led to an increasing awareness of the role of cultural factors in psychological functioning together with repeated calls to “indigenize” psychology (Kim, Yang, &amp; Hwang, 2006). International contacts among psychologists as well as joint research and applied projects across national and geographic boundaries have prospered thanks to the rapidly evolving technologies of transportation and  [[Telecommunication|electronic communication]]. Consequently, one may safely predict that the cross-cultural, global, and international dimensions of psychology will become more prominent in the foreseeable future.

{{Fiqh |sexual}}

'''Islamic sexual jurisprudence''' concerns the Islamic laws of [[sexuality]] in [[Islam]], as largely predicated on the [[Quran|Qur'an]], the sayings of [[Muhammad]] (''[[hadith]]'') and the rulings of religious leaders' (''[[fatwa]]'') confining [[sexual activity]] to [[marriage|marital]] relationships [[Heterosexuality|between men and women]]. While most traditions discourage [[celibacy]], all encourage strict [[chastity]], [[modesty]] and [[privacy]] with regard to any relationships between [[gender]]s, holding forth that their [[intimate relationship|intimacy]] as perceived within Islam{{spaced ndash}}encompassing a swath of life broader than sexual activity{{spaced ndash}}is largely reserved for marriage. This sensitivity to gender difference and modesty outside of marriage can be seen in current prominent aspects of Islam, such as interpretations of [[list of types of sartorial hijab|Islamic dress]] and degrees of [[sex segregation and Islam|gender segregation]].

While prohibitions against [[extramarital sex]] are strong, sexual activity itself is not a taboo subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islam-usa.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=289&amp;Itemid=301 | title=Sex education, teenage pregnancy, sex in Islam and marriage | publisher=/www.islam-usa.com | accessdate=13 June 2015 | author=Dr. Shahid Athar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myummah.co.za/site/2008/03/15/sunnah-of-the-wedding-night/|title=Sunnah of the Wedding Night|date=15 March 2008|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317145545/http://myummah.co.za/site/2008/03/15/sunnah-of-the-wedding-night/|archivedate=17 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Permissible sexual relationships are described in [[Quran]] and [[Hadith]] as great wells of love and closeness. Even after marriage, there are limitations: a man should not have intercourse during his wife's menstruation and afterbirth periods. He is also considered to be sinning when [[anal sex|penetrating anally]]. Islam itself is a [[natalist]] religion, therefore it encourages increasing procreation through marital sexual relationships. Actions and behaviours such as [[abortion]] (other than for medical risk to the pregnant woman) {{additional citation needed|date=June 2018}} and [[homosexuality]] are also [[Haram|strictly forbidden]]; temporary [[contraceptive]] use is permitted for [[birth control]].

==Sex education==
===Adult===
Muslim men and women asked Muhammad about issues concerning sexual behavior, so as to know the teachings and rulings of their religion. Muslims could pose their questions either to Muhammad directly or to his wives.&lt;ref name=ii&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex education: An Islamic Perspective |url=https://www.islamicity.org/2191/sex-education-an-islamic-perspective/ |website=www.islamicity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ii2&gt;{{cite web |title=Sex Education in Islam |url=https://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/education.html |website=islamawareness.net |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[hadith]] attributed to Muhammad's wife [[Aisha]] states that the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] women in particular were not shy about asking questions regarding sexual matters.&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari, Book 3, Number 0649&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
Parents are responsible for the upbringing of their children,&lt;ref&gt;Al-Bukhaari (853) and Muslim (1829)&lt;/ref&gt; and that responsibility includes protecting them from anything that may corrupt their morals. Early sex education for children is not recommended by Islamic scholars, as the knowledge contained in such curricula may be a negative influence on a young child's mind.&lt;ref name=iqa&gt;{{cite web |title=What is the appropriate age to teach children sex education? |url=https://islamqa.info/en/138101 |website=islamqa.info |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=He studies in a mixed school in a foreign country and is asking about attending "sex education" classes |website=islamqa.info |url=https://islamqa.info/en/113970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid]], young children should instead be taught Islamic rules involving covering the [[Intimate parts in Islam|‘awrah]], controlling one's gaze, and asking permission before entering private spaces.&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

Munajjid also suggested to separate the bed of children at the age of ten according to hadith:&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;
{{quote|It was narrated from ‘Amr ibn Shu‘ayb, from his father, that his grandfather said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “Instruct your children to pray when they are seven years old, and smack them if they do not do it when they are ten years old, and separate them in their beds.”| Abu Dawood (495)}}

Shaykh Muhammad Shams al-Haqq al-‘Azeemabaadi said:&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

{{quote|Al-Mannaawi said in Fath al-Qadeer Sharh al-Jaami‘ as-Sagheer: That is, separate your children in the beds in which they sleep when they reach the age of ten, as a precaution against provocation of desire, even in the case of sisters. At-Teebi said: Allah mentioned together the ideas of instructing them to pray and separating them in their beds in childhood, so as to discipline them and obey all the commands of Allah, and to teach them, to show them proper etiquette with people, and to teach them not to put themselves in suspicious situations and to keep away from sin.|Awn al-Ma‘bood (2/115)}}

Munajjid stated, this ''advice and guidance'' from this verse has to do with protecting and concealing the ‘awrah and avoiding provocation of desire which begins, as we have seen, in the tenth year, which is the age at which most children reach discernment.&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

When puberty approaches, children should be taught the signs of puberty and the characteristics which distinguish men from women, and the types of discharge that may be emitted from the front passage of both sexes. They should also be taught the rulings on wudoo’ and ghusl, paying attention to the phrases used in teaching and ensuring that it is taught according to what the child needs to know. Munajjid has maintained two as important matters which should begin at a very early age – around the age of three years – that have a basic connection to the issue of sex education. They are:&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

# The necessity for the boy or girl to be able to distinguish between male and female. Confusion between them at that early age could lead to troubles and confusion in concepts, characteristics and actions, in both sexes. Hence it is essential to make a boy understand that he cannot wear his sister’s clothes, or wear earrings or bracelets, because these are for females, not for males. By the same token, a girl should be told similar things about her brother’s actions and characteristics.

# Teaching children that the ‘awrah is private, and that it should not be uncovered for anyone. Teaching them this, and bringing them up with it, is a way of instilling in them the characteristics of chastity and modesty, and will help prevent perverts from transgressing against them.&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;  
 
Finally he stated, “With regard to the issue of sex education having to do with intercourse, or what happens between spouses in general, this should come when there is a need for it, such as when marriage is approaching, or when he is mature enough to understand some issues of fiqh, such as the rulings on zina (fornication or adultery) and the like, which have to do with intercourse and ‘awrahs. It should be noted that what is needed of that knowledge is basically something that is natural and instinctive in the first place, and what you need to point out must be taught to children gradually, in accordance with the stages of their development, by means of lessons of fiqh, study circles and classes in school. We should be conservative in the words and phrases we use, and attention must be paid to the appropriate ages and stages to discuss this topic. We must also warn against the promiscuous practices of the disbelievers and contrast them with the beauty of Islam, with regard to urging Muslims to cover up and be modest, and to guard their chastity and avoid that which is haraam."&lt;ref name=iqa/&gt;

==Circumcision==
{{See also|Khitan (circumcision)|Khafd}}
''Khitan'' or ''Khatna'' ({{lang-ar|ختان}}, {{lang-ar|ختنة}}) is the term for male [[circumcision]] carried out as a [[Islamic culture|cultural rite]] by Muslims and is considered a sign of belonging to the wider [[Islam]]ic community.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |title=Circumcision of boys |accessdate=2008-07-29 |work=Religion &amp; ethics&amp;mdash;Islam |publisher=BBC |date=2006-03-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305204605/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |archivedate=2008-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether or not it should be carried out after [[converting to Islam]] is debated among Islamic scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://convertingtoislam.com/circum.html |title=Male circumcision - the Islamic View |publisher=www.convertingtoislam.com |accessdate=2013-02-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130214054917/http://convertingtoislam.com/circum.html |archivedate=2013-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicinvitationcentre.com/FAQ/converts/FAQ_converts.html#Anchor-34662circumcision|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227151507/http://islamicinvitationcentre.com/FAQ/converts/FAQ_converts.html#Anchor-34662circumcision|archivedate=2010-12-27 |title=Is Circumcision obligatory after conversion? |publisher=Islamicinvitationcentre.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1731&amp;CATE=115 |title=Considering Converting: Is it necessary to be circumcised? |publisher=Qa.sunnipath.com |date=2005-07-03 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716152023/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?HD=1&amp;ID=1731&amp;CATE=115 |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=13339&amp;hd=3&amp;cate=0&amp;t=rss |title=Circumcision for Converts |publisher=Qa.sunnipath.com |date=2007-03-21 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716180532/http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?id=13339&amp;hd=3&amp;cate=0&amp;t=rss |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an itself does not mention circumcision explicitly in any verse. Some hadith mentions circumcision in a list of practices known as ''[[fitra]]'' (acts considered to be of a refined person). [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Hurayra]], a companion of Muhammad, was quoted saying, {{quote|"Five things are fitra: circumcision, shaving pubic hair with a razor, trimming the mustache, paring one's nails and plucking the hair from one's armpits" |(reported in  the  ''hadiths'' of [[Sahih al-Bukhari]] and  [[Sahih Muslim]]).}} 
So, despite its absence from the Qur'an, it has been a [[Religious male circumcision|religious]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; custom from the beginning of Islam. However, there are other ''hadiths'' which do not name circumcision as part of the characteristics of ''fitra''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/bukhari/77/107|title=Hadith - Book of Dress - Sahih al-Bukhari - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|website=www.sunnah.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916095339/http://sunnah.com/bukhari/77/107|archivedate=2013-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and yet another ''hadith'' which names ten characteristics, again without naming circumcision; in Sahih Muslim, Aisha is quoted, {{quote|"The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Ten are the acts according to fitra: clipping the mustache, letting the beard grow, using toothpicks, snuffing water in the nose, cutting the nails, washing the finger joints, plucking the hair under the armpits, shaving pubic hair and cleaning one's private parts with water. The narrator said: I have forgotten the tenth, but it may have been rinsing the mouth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/muslim/2/71|title=Hadith - The Book of Purification - Sahih Muslim - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|website=www.sunnah.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018144335/http://sunnah.com/muslim/2/71|archivedate=2013-10-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Hence, the different hadiths do not correspond on whether circumcision is part of fitra or not. According to some traditions Muhammad was born without a [[foreskin]] ([[Aposthia|aposthetic]]), while others maintain that his grandfather [[Abdul-Muttalib]] circumcised him when he was seven days old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |title=Religions - Islam: Circumcision of boys |publisher=BBC |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2012-02-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629074142/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/islamethics/malecircumcision.shtml |archivedate=2012-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Al-Halabi, Ali Ibn-Burhan-al-Din.

[[Imam]]s [[Abū Ḥanīfa]], founder of the [[Hanafi]] school of ''[[Fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence), and [[Malik ibn Anas]], maintain that circumcision is a ''[[Sunnah]] Mu'akkadah''—not obligatory but highly recommended. The [[Shafi`i]] and [[Hanbali]] schools see it as binding on all Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545032 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530090925/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545032 |archivedate=2010-05-30 |title=Medical Ethics of Male Circumcision |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-05-30 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic sources do not fix a particular time for circumcision. It depends on family, region and country. A majority of Ulema however take the view that parents should get their child circumcised before the age of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islamicvoice.com/may.2000/dialogue.htm |title=Circumcision |publisher=Islamicvoice.com |date=2000-03-28 |accessdate=2012-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626223309/http://www.islamicvoice.com/may.2000/dialogue.htm |archivedate=2012-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred age is usually seven although some Muslims are circumcised as early as on the seventh day after birth and as late as at the commencement of [[puberty]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;

== Puberty ==
{{See also|Islamic theological jurisprudence|Islam and children}}

''Bāligh'' or ''bulūgh'' ({{lang-ar|بالغ or بُلوغ}}) refers to a person who has reached [[adulthood|maturity]] or [[puberty]], and has full responsibility under [[Sharia|Islamic law]].

For example, in issues pertaining to [[Marriage in Islam|marriage]], ''baligh'' is related to the [[Arabic]] legal expression, ''hatta tutiqa'l-rijal'', which means that a wedding may not take place until the girl is physically fit to engage in [[sexual intercourse]]. In comparison, ''baligh'' or ''balaghat'' concerns the reaching of [[sexual maturity]] which becomes manifest by the [[menses]]. The age related to these two concepts can, but need not necessarily, coincide. Only after a separate condition called ''rushd'', or intellectual maturity to handle one's own property, is reached can a girl receive her [[bridewealth]].&lt;ref&gt;Masud, ''Islamic Legal Interpretation, Muftis and Their Fatwas'', [[Harvard University]] Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

A boy may reach maturity from the age of 10 lunar years (nine years, eight months and twenty days) and will be considered mature at the age of 15 lunar years (14 years, 6 months and 22 days) if no signs of maturity are found. Signs of maturity for a boy include: wet dreams and ejaculation. A girl may reach maturity from the age of 9 lunar years (approximately eight years and eight months) and will be considered mature at the age of 15 lunar years (14 years, 6 months and 22 days) if no signs of maturity are found. Signs of maturity for a girl: menstruation, wet dream or pregnancy.

==Conservatism==
{{see also|Awrah|Mahram|Islam and clothing}}
Islam has strongly emphasized the concept of conservatism, decency and [[modesty]]; besides the lawful sexuality, priority is given to modesty and chastity both inside and outside the marital relationships. In the [[hadith|hadith literature]], modesty has been described as "a part of faith.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://40hadithnawawi.com/index.php/the-hadiths/hadith-20 | title=Hadith 20 :: Modesty is from Faith | publisher=40hadithnawawi.com | accessdate=27 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20150729011802/http://40hadithnawawi.com/index.php/the-hadiths/hadith-20 | archivedate=29 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: Once Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) passed by an Ansari (man) who was admonishing to his brother regarding Haya'. On that Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, "Leave him as Haya'(self-respect, modesty, bashfulness) is a part of faith."|Sahih Bukhari: 24}}

Modesty is verily required in the interaction between members of the opposite sex and in some case between the members of same sex also. [[Islam and clothing|Dress-code]] is part of that overall teaching.&lt;ref name="Marital privacy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.quran.mu/marital-privacy-in-islam.html | title=Marital privacy in Islam | accessdate=1 December 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208211244/http://www.quran.mu/marital-privacy-in-islam.html | archivedate=8 December 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/138101 | title=What is the appropriate age to teach children sex education? | publisher=[[islamqa.info]] | accessdate=27 November 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208044332/http://islamqa.info/en/138101 | archivedate=8 December 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Quran, the subjects deal with modesty and privacy of men and women has been mostly described in [[An-Nur]]. For example, it has been mentioned,

{{quotation|"Say to the believing men that they lower their gaze and restrain their sexual passions. That is purer for them. Surely Allah is Aware of what they do. And say to the believing women that they lower their gaze and restrain their sexual passions and do not display their adornment except what appears thereof. -- And let them wear their head-coverings over their bosoms. And they should not display their adornment except to their husbands or their fathers, or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons, or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or those whom their -- right hands possess, or guileless male servants, or the children who know not women's nakedness. And let them not strike their feet so that the adornment that they hide may be known. And turn to Allah all, O believers, so that you may be successful. And marry those among you who are single, and those who are fit among your male slaves and your female slaves. If they are needy, Allah will make them free from want out of His grace. And Allah is Ample-giving, Knowing. And let those who cannot find a match keep chaste, until Allah makes them free from want out of His grace."|[[An-Nur]] 24:30-33}}

{{quotation|"O you who believe, let those whom your right hands possess and those of you who have not attained to puberty ask permission of you three times: Before the morning prayer, and when you put off your clothes for the heat of noon, and after the prayer of night. These are three times of privacy for you; besides these it is no sin for you nor for them -- some of you go round about (waiting) upon others. Thus does Allah make clear to you the messages. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. And when the children among you attain to puberty, let them seek permission as those before them sought permission. Thus does Allah make clear to you His messages. And Allah is Knowing, Wise. And (as for) women past childbearing, who hope not for marriage, it is no sin for them if they put off their clothes without displaying their adornment. And if they are modest, it is better for them. And Allah is Hearing, Knowing. There is no blame on the blind man, nor any blame on the lame, nor blame on the sick, nor on yourselves that you eat in your own houses, or your fathers' houses, or your mothers' houses, or your brothers' houses, or your sisters' houses; or your paternal uncles' houses, or your paternal aunts' houses, or your maternal uncles' houses, or your maternal aunts' houses, or (houses) whereof you possess the keys, or your friends' (houses). It is no sin in you that you eat together or separately. So when you enter houses, greet your people with a salutation from Allah, blessed (and) goodly. Thus does Allah make clear to you the messages that you may understand."|[[An-Nur]] 24:58-61}}

Hadith also describes the laws of modesty. Along with Quran it has also emphasized marriage as a requirement for modesty and chastity. For example,

{{quotation|Narrated by Abdullah ibn Masud, the prophet said, "O young men, whoever among you can afford to get married, let him do so, as it lower the eyesight and guard his modesty and whoever cannot afford it, let him fast, for that will be a shield for him."|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|bukhari|7|62|4}},{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|bukhari|4778}}, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1400}}}}

It has been mentioned in [[Hadith]] ranging about men's and women's [[Intimate parts in Islam|private parts]] that,
Regarding women follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Asma, daughter of Abu Bakr, entered upon the Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) wearing thin clothes. The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) turned his attention from her. He said: O Asma’, when a woman reaches the age of menstruation, it does not suit her that she displays her parts of body except this and this, and he pointed to her face and hands." Abu Dawud&lt;ref&gt;http://veil.unc.edu/religions/islam/hadith/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"After Muhammad issued the command (Quran 24:31) for women to cover themselves, the women responded by tearing up sheets [or outer garments] to cover their faces." Sahih Bukhari (60:282)&lt;ref name="sahih-bukhari.com"&gt;https://www.sahih-bukhari.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding men follows:
{{quotation|Narrated by Muawiah ibn Haydah, " I said : Apostle of Allah, from whom should we conceal our private parts and to whom can we show? He replied : conceal your private parts except from your wife and from whom your right hand possesses (concubines). I then asked: Apostle of Allah, (what should we do), if the people are assembled together? He replied: If it is within your power then no one will look at it, then you should try that no one can look it. I then asked: Apostle of Allah, if one of us is alone? He replied: Allah is more entitled than people that bashfulness should be shown to him (feel shy more to Allah than to people)."|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|31|4006}}}}

{{quotation|Narrated Jarhad: The Apostle of Allah (peace_be_upon_him) sat with us and my thigh was uncovered. He said: Do you not know that thigh is a private part.|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|31|4003}}}}

{{quotation|The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Do not uncover you thigh, and do not look at the thigh of the living and the dead.|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|31|4004}}}}

It is forbidden for both spouses to spread the secrets of what happens between them in their private marital life; indeed, this is one of the most evil things. Quran says,&lt;ref name="Marital privacy"/&gt;
{{quotation|So the good women are obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded.|[[An-Nisa]] 4:34}}
And also the Muhammad said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Etiquette of intimate relations |url=https://islamqa.info/en/5560 |website=islamqa.info |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quotation|“Among the most evil of people before Allaah on the Day of Resurrection will be a man who comes to his wife and has intercourse with her, then he spreads her secrets.” |Muslim, 4/157}}

{{quotation|It was reported from Asmaa’ bint Yazeed that she was with the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and men and women were sitting with him, and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Would any man say what he did with his wife? Would any woman tell others what she did with her husband?” The people kept quiet and did not answer. I [Asmaa’] said: “Yes, by Allaah, O Messenger of Allaah, they (women) do that, and they (men) do that.” He said, “Do not do that. It is like a male devil meeting a female devil in the road and having intercourse with her whilst the people are watching.”|Abu Dawood, no. 1/339}}

{{quotation|Allah's Messenger said: The most wicked among the people in the eye of Allah on the Day of judgment is the men who goes to his wife and she comes to him, and then he divulges her secret (to others).| [http://sunnah.com/muslim/16/145 Sahih Muslim - 3369]}}&lt;ref name="Marital privacy"/&gt;

Privacy between unmarried man and woman is not allowed following:
{{quote|Narrated Ibn `Abbas: The Prophet (ﷺ) said, "A woman should not travel except with a Dhu-Mahram (her husband or a man with whom that woman cannot marry at all according to the Islamic Jurisprudence), and no man may visit her except in the presence of a Dhu-Mahram." A man got up and said, "O Allah's Messenger (ﷺ)! I intend to go to such and such an army and my wife wants to perform Hajj." The Prophet (ﷺ) said (to him), "Go along with her (to Hajj).| Muslim 1740}}

The following hadiths also commands maintaining basic privacy in societal gathering: 
{{quotation|Narrated by Abu Said Khudri: The prophet said, "A man should not look at the private part of another man, and a woman should not look at the private parts of another woman.

In another [[hadith]] it has been mentioned,
{{quotation|The Messenger of Allah said: "Instruct your children to pray when they are seven years old, and smack them if they do not do it when they are ten years old, and separate them in their beds."|Narrated by Abu Dawood (495)}}

There is also prescription of modesty and privacy in case of unlawful sexual acts. It is mentioned in the hadith below from [[Muwatta Imam Malik]]:

{{quotation|Malik related to me from Zayd ibn Aslam that a man confessed to fornication in the time of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, called for a whip, and he was brought a broken whip. He said, "Above this," and he was brought a new whip whose knots had not been cut yet. He said, "Below this," and he was brought a whip which had been used and made flexible. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, gave the order and he was flogged. Then he said, "People! The time has come for you to observe the limits of Allah. Whoever has had any of these ugly things befall him should cover them up with the veil of Allah. Whoever reveals to us his wrong action, we perform what is in the Book of Allah against him."|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muwatta|41|2|12}}}}

Some hadith warn against immodesty including as follows,
{{quotation|"The Messenger of Allah said: ‘ ... There are five things with which you will be tested, and I seek refuge with Allah lest you live to see them: Promiscuity (sexual immorality) never appears among a people to such an extent that they commit it openly, but plagues and diseases that were never known among the predecessors will spread among them. ..."| [http://www.sunnah.com/urn/1291190 Sunan Ibn Majah - 4,019]}}

==Marriage==
{{main|Marriage in Islam}}

Marriage (Nikah) is a contract between Muslim men and his wife. Marriage has been described in tradition (hadith) as half of the religion with the regards of preserving chastity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Marriage half of faith? |url=https://eshaykh.com/hadith/general-2/ |website=eshaykh.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Is marriage half of religion? - islamqa.info |url=https://islamqa.info/en/11586 |website=isamqa.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sex within marriage ==
{{further|Islamic marital jurisprudence}}

In Islamic law, marriage legalizes sexual intercourse between the husband and wife. Marriage is not restricted to a platonic relationship nor is it only for procreation. Marriage is greatly encouraged in Islam, partially because it provides a lawful institution in which to fulfill one's sexual urges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/5560 | title=Etiquette of intimate relations | publisher=islamqa.info | work=Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724204418/http://islamqa.info/en/5560 | archivedate=24 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zawaj.com/articles/sex_and_marriage_q-and-a.html | title=Sex &amp; Marriage in Islam | publisher=zawaj.com | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710223229/http://www.zawaj.com/articles/sex_and_marriage_q-and-a.html | archivedate=10 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.al-islam.org/islamic-marriage-syed-athar-husain-sh-rizvi/importance-marriage-islam | title=Importance of Marriage in Islam | publisher=Al-Islam.org | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724205547/http://www.al-islam.org/islamic-marriage-syed-athar-husain-sh-rizvi/importance-marriage-islam | archivedate=24 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam does provide extensive rules regarding sex; however, within the conditional institution of marriage, there are sources in both the Qur'an and hadith, which promote the well being of humans and their natural sexual instincts. In the Surah Baqarah, sex in married life is openly recommended: {{quote|"When they [i.e. wives] have cleansed themselves [after menstruation], you go into them as Allah has commanded."|(2:222)}}&lt;ref group="Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project"&gt;{{cite web |title=Importance of Marriage in Islam |url=http://www.al-islam.org/marriage-handbook/3.htm |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504205154/http://www.al-islam.org/marriage-handbook/3.htm |archivedate=May 4, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been also said: {{quote|"Those who guard their chastity (ie. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) except from their wives or (the captives and slaves) that their right hands possess, - for them, they are free from blame."|[al-Mu’minoon 23:5-6]}} Additionally, sources of hadith illustrate similar promotion of fulfilling sexual urges in lawful ways within a marriage. The Wasaelush Shia quotes Muhammad as encouraging his followers to marry, saying: {{quote|"O, you young men! I recommend marriage to you."|The Wasaelush Shia (vol. 14, p.&amp;nbsp;25)}}&lt;ref group="Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project"&gt;{{cite web |last=S.H.

Prophet Muhammad also declared marital sex as charity:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''Having intercourse (with one's wife) is a charity. |url=https://salaficentre.com/2014/05/having-intercourse-with-ones-wife-is-a-charity/ |website=The Salafi Centre of Manchester |accessdate=19 June 2018|date=2014-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|"When one of you have sex with your wife, it is a rewarded act of charity." The Companions were surprised and said, "But we do it purely out of our desire. How can it be counted as charity?" The Prophet replied, "If you had done it with a forbidden woman, it would have been counted as a sin, but if you do it in legitimacy, it is counted as charity.”|Muslim. Number 1674}}

=== Sexual techniques ===

One of the areas of Islamic sexual jurisprudence in which there are not many restrictions is the discussion of sexual techniques. Almost all of what is practiced under Islamic law concerning sexual techniques and the act of sexual intercourse come from 'hadith'', which are not restrictive in nature, but followed by a mutual etiquette known as foreplay,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Turning Sex Into Sadaqa An excerpt from 'The Muslim Marriage Guide.' |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/faiths/islam/2001/04/turning-sex-into-sadaqa.aspx |website=beliefnet.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kissing and Foreplay |url=https://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/kissf.htm |website=central-mosque.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE RULES OF NIKAH: BEDROOM ETIQUETTES IN ISLAM |url=http://www.authentictauheed.com/2011/07/112-bedroom-etiquettes-in-islam.html |website=authentictauheed.com |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the hadith follows:

{{quote|Imam al-Daylami records a narration on the authority of Anas ibn Malik that the Messenger of Allah (Allah bless him &amp; give him peace) is reported to have said:  "Not one of you should fulfil one’s (sexual) need from/fall upon his wife like an animal; but let there first be a messenger between you." "And what is that messenger?" they asked, and he replied: "Kisses and words".”|Musnad al-Firdaws Of al-Daylami, 2/55}}

The main tendency within these ''hadith'' are saying for Muslims to follow in the bedroom, saying which "clearly show that the husband and the wife should feel completely free when they are engaged in mutual stimulation which is known as foreplay.

Allah says in the Qur'an: {{quote|Your wives are a tilth for you, so go to your tilth (have sexual relations with your wives in any manner as long as it is in the vagina and not in the anus), when or how you will, and send (good deeds, or ask Allah to bestow upon you pious offspring) for your own selves beforehand. And fear Allah, and know that you are to meet Him (in the Hereafter), and give good tidings to the believers (O Muhammad).|{{cite quran|2|223|s=ns}}}}

In the foregoing verse the word harth (tilth) indicates that any kind of vaginal sex is permissible in Islam, because it is from this place children are produced; and it is also regardless any of sexual positions, because although top to bottom position has been encouraged most, but none of the vaginal sexual positions has been mentioned as prohibited in scripture and tradition.&lt;ref name=alis&gt;{{cite web |title=1.What are the positions and ways of having sex are legal in islam? |url=http://www.islamhelpline.net/node/3692 |website=islamhelpline.net |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexual Techniques |url=https://www.al-islam.org/islamic-marriage-handbook-syed-athar-husayn-sh-rizvi/sexual-techniques |website=www.al-islam.org |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The semen lodged in the womb from which offspring comes is likened to the seeds that are planted in the ground, bringing vegetation. Both of them are substances from which something else is produced. Hence, conversely, one area of sexual techniques that is generally prohibited is [[anal intercourse]].&lt;ref name=alis/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=There is nothing in Islam to say that anal intercourse is permissible |url=https://islamqa.info/en/91968 |website=islamqa.info |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Ruling on Anal Sex |url=https://archive.islamonline.net/?p=669 |website=islamonline.net |accessdate=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All Muslim jurists agree that anal sex is haram (prohibited), based on the hadith of Muhammad: {{quote|Do not have anal sex with women.|Reported by Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa'i, and Ibn Majah}}

{{quote|Muhammad also said, "Cursed he. ..who has sex with a woman through her back passage."|Ahmad}}

{{quote|Khuzaymah Ibn Thabit also reported that the Messenger of Allah said: "Allah is not too shy to tell you the truth: Do not have sex with your wives in the anus."|Reported by Ahmad, 5/213}}

{{quote|Ibn Abbas narrated: "The Messenger of Allah said: "Allah will not look at a man who has anal sex with his wife."|Reported by Ibn Abi Shaybah, 3/529; At-Tirmidhi classified it as an authentic hadith, 1165}}

Further, it is reported that Muhammad referred to such an act as "minor sodomy". (Reported by Ahmad and An-Nasa'i)

{{quote|It is reported that `Umar Ibn Al-Khattab came one day to Muhammad and said, "O Messenger of Allah, I am ruined!" "What has ruined you?" asked the Prophet. He replied, "Last night I turned my wife over," meaning that he had had vaginal intercourse with her from the back. The Prophet did not say anything to him until the verse cited above was revealed. Then he told him, "[Make love with your wife] from the front or the back, but avoid the anus and intercourse during menstruation." (Reported by Ahmad and At-Tirmidhi)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/technique.html | title=Sex Technique | publisher=islamawareness.net | accessdate=27 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721002113/http://www.islamawareness.net/Sex/technique.html | archivedate=21 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Sexual obligations ===
In Islam, the husband should have intercourse with his wife according to what satisfies her, so long as that does not harm him physically or keep him from earning a living. The husband is obliged to treat his wife in a kind and reasonable manner. Part of that kind and reasonable treatment is intercourse, which he has to do. The majority of scholars set the time limit beyond which it is not permissible for the husband to forego intercourse at four months, but according to some scholars, the view is that there is no time limit.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Qudaamah, Malik, [[Al-Mughni]], 7/30, Al-Jassaas, Ahkaam al-Qur’aan, 1/374, Shaykh al-Islam, Al-Ikhtiyaaraat al-Fiqhiyyah, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the scholars have said that, It is obligatory on women alike not to refuse their husbands if they call them, so long as the woman who is called is not menstruating or sick in such a way that intercourse will be harmful to her, or observing an obligatory fast. If she refuses with no excuse, then she is cursed.&lt;ref&gt;al-Fataawa al-Islamiyyah, 3/145, 146, Kashf al-Qinaa’, 5/189, [[Al-Muhalla]], 10/40, Kashf al-Qinaa’, 5/189&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet said: "If a man calls his wife to his bed, and she refuses to come, the angels curse her until morning comes."|al-Bukhari, 3065; Muslim, 1436.}}

But it is not permissible for a husband to force his wife to do more than she is able to bear of intercourse. If she has an excuse such as being sick or unable to bear it, then she is not sinning if she refuses to have intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/9602 | title=Her husband has strong desire; what should she do? | publisher=[[islamqa.info]] | work=Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid | accessdate=2 August 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811224131/http://islamqa.info/en/9602 | archivedate=11 August 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procreation===
In Islamic jurisprudence, the primary purpose of sex between marriage is [[procreation]].&lt;ref name=jawaz2/&gt; Islam recognizes the strong sexual urge and desire for reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Shahid Athar |title=Sex Education: An Islamic Perspective |url=https://www.islamicity.org/2191/sex-education-an-islamic-perspective/ |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. M.A. Rauf from his book 'Marriage in Islam'. In this excerpt, he discusses in great detail the advantages and possible disadvantages of marriage. Among the advantages that he discusses are procreation, fulfilment of the natural urge, companionship, comfort and relief to the soul, and so on. He also discusses the disadvantages and the types of burdens and risks involved with marriage. All of the advantages or benefits are in effect meant to be regarded as the secondary purpose of marriage which supplement its major aim or purpose, namely procreation. To beget children. This is the main purpose for marriage. The aim is to engender and preserve the human race. Four objectives are accomplished through procreation: - (i) to increase mankind (ii) Islam is propagated by increasing the number of followers of the prophet Muhammad (iii)parents will hope to leave behind children who will pray for them (iv) and According to Islamic belief, if a child dies before the parents, the prayers of the child in paradise will be very beneficial for the parents.&lt;ref name=jawaz2&gt;{{cite web |author1=Syed Mumtaz Ali &amp; Rabia Mills |title=Sex in Islam: Its Role and Purpose |url=https://www.zawaj.com/articles/sex_mumtaz.html |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children born of the matrimonial union become legitimate and mutual rights of inheritance are established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Mohammad Mazhar Hussaini |authorlink1=Marriage and Family in Islam" by Mohammad Mazhar Hussaini |title=Purpose and obligation of marriage life |url=https://www.soundvision.com/article/purpose-and-obligation-of-marriage-life |accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam also supposts a [[natalism|pro-natalist]] view of procreation through many hadith.

{{quote| Ma’qil ibn Yasaar said: A man came to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and said, “I have found a woman who is of good lineage and is beautiful, but she does not children. Should I marry her?” He said, “No.” Then he came again with the same question and he told him not to marry her. Then he came a third time with the same question and he said: “Marry those who are loving and fertile, for I will be proud of your great numbers before the other nations.|Abu Dawood (2050)}}

This hadeeth indicates that it is encouraged to marry women who are fertile, so that the numbers of the ummah will increase, and so the Prophet Muhammad will feel proud of his [[Ummah|followers]] before all other nations. This shows that it is encouraged to have a lot of children.&lt;ref name="IQA2"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid]] |title=Fiqh of the family. arur 13492: Encouragement to have a lot of children |url=https://islamqa.info/en/13492 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |accessdate=8 October 2018 |date=5 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Narrated 'Abdullah: We used to participate in the holy battles led by Allah's Messenger and we had nothing (no wives) with us. So we said, "Shall we get ourselves castrated?" He forbade us that and then allowed us to marry women with a temporary contract (2) and recited to us: -- 'O you who believe ! Make not unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, but commit no transgression.' (5.87) Narrated Abu Huraira: I said, "O Allah's Messenger! I am a young man and I am afraid that I may commit illegal sexual intercourse and I cannot afford to marry." He kept silent, and then repeated my question once again, but he kept silent. I said the same (for the third time) and he remained silent. Then repeated my question (for the fourth time), and only then the Prophet said, "O Abu Huraira! The pen has dried after writing what you are going to confront. So (it does not matter whether you) get yourself castrated or not."|Bukhari, 4705}}

{{quote|the Messenger of Allah said: "Marriage is part of my sunnah, and whoever does not follow my sunnah has nothing to do with me. Get married, for I will boast of your great numbers before the nations. Whoever has the means, let him get married, and whoever does not, then he should fast for it will diminish his desire."|Ibn Majah 1846}}

{{quote|"The Messenger of Allah disapproved of Uthman bin Mazun's desire to remain celibate; if he had given him permission, we would have gotten ourselves castrated."|Ibn Majah, 1848}}

{{quote|the Messenger of Allah forbade celibacy. Zaid bin Akhzam added: "And Qatadah recited: 'And indeed We sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad ), and made for them wives and offspring.|Ibn Majah 1849}}

== Fornication and adultery ==
{{main|Zina}}

Just as Islamic law fosters sexual actions within a marriage or lawful concubinage with wholly owned female slaves, there is also judicial opinion concerning sexual relations outside of these institutions. These laws, however, observe much stricter restrictions. Additionally, these laws have textual confirmation from the Qur'an.
{{quote|Fornicatoress and fornicator flog each one of them one hundred lashes; and do not take pity on them in the application of God's law if you believe in God and last day; and their punishment should be witnesses by a party of believers. Fornicator does not marry except a fornicatoress or polytheist women; and fornicatoress no one marry her except fornicator or polytheist man;and it is prohibited to believers. And those who accuse chaste women and then never bring four witness flog them eighty lashes; and do not accept their testimony for ever; they themselves are disobedient. Except those who repent after this and become good then God is forgiving and merciful. And those who accuse their wives and do not have witness except themselves then witness of each of them are four witnesses by God that he is of truthfuls. And fifth that curse of God be on him if he is of lier. And it can save her from punishment that she witnesses by God four times that he is of liers. And fifth time that wrath of God be on her if he is of truthfuls. (al-Qur'an 24:2-9)}}

Verse 24:2-3 states that outside marriage and [[concubinage]], Islamic law prohibits sexual relations as ''zina'' [fornication]. Verse 24:2-3 establishes that male and female fornicators are to be flogged one-hundred times. According to Hadith, married male and female fornicators are to be stoned to death.&lt;ref name="Suad 2007 531"&gt;{{cite book |last=Suad |first=Joseph |title=Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures |year=2007 |publisher=Brill, Leiden |location=Boston |page=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, one practice outside marriage that does exist within Islamic law is legal sexual relations between a man and an unmarried female slave whom he owns. [[Malik ibn Anas]] cites a report in which "Umar b. al-Khattab says that when a female slave gives birth to a child by her master, then the slave becomes an ''umm walad'' (mother of a child, concubine)."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Suad |first=Joseph |title=Encyclopedia |year=2007 |publisher=Brill, Leiden |location=Boston |page=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Illegal sex (fornication) ===

Similar to laws that prohibit extramarital sexual relations, the Qur'an also stipulates categories of women with whom men are prohibited from engaging in sexual intercourse. Verse 4:22-4 lists mothers, daughters, sisters, aunts, nieces, [[wet nurse]]s, wet nurses' daughters, wives' mothers, daughters of wives from different fathers, wives of sons, and women already married.

Additionally, Verse 2:222 prohibits sexual relations with women during menstruation. Muhammad specifically restricts the injunction "to segregate the women" and "not go near them" in 2:222 to a prohibition against sexual relations with menstruating women.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Pornography==
Pornography is considered haram and a clear sin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gsalam.net/10-reasons-muslim-quit-watching-pornography/|title=10 Reasons The Muslim Should Quit Watching Pornography|date=28 August 2015|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102104315/http://www.gsalam.net/10-reasons-muslim-quit-watching-pornography/|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/166123|title=Her husband watches porn with the excuse of stress at work|website=www.islamqa.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830004408/https://islamqa.info/en/166123|archivedate=2017-08-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran states: 
{{quote|“Tell the faithful men to cast down their looks and to guard their private parts ...Tell the faithful women to cast down their looks and to guard their private parts, and not to display their charms except what is apparent thereof and put their scarves over their bosoms...|(Quran, 24:30-31)}}

==Prostitution==
[[Prostitution]] is banned in Islam.&lt;ref name=pro&gt;{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/5707|title=The difference between slaves and prostitutes|website=www.islamqa.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510161236/https://islamqa.info/en/5707|archivedate=2017-05-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quran states,

{{quote|And compel not your slave-girls to prostitution when they desire to keep chaste, in order to seek the frail goods of this world's life. And whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion Allah is Forgiving, Merciful..|{{cite quran|24|33|s=ns}}}}

Prostitution (trading sex for money) is haraam. If any does this then he shall be stoned to death. It was practiced by some Arabs during the 6th century. In the 7th century, [[Muhammad]] declared that prostitution is forbidden on all grounds.

{{quote|Jabir reported that 'Abdullah b. Ubayy b. Salul used to say to his slave-girl:
Go and fetch something for us by committing prostitution . It was in this connection that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, revealed this verse:" And compel not your slave-girls to prostitution when they desire to keep chaste in order to seek the frail goods of this world's life, and whoever compels them, then surely after their compulsion Allah is Forgiving, Merciful" (xxiv. 33).|{{Hadith-usc|Muslim|usc=yes|43|7180}},{{Hadith-usc|Muslim|usc=yes|43|7181}},{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|12|2304}}}}

Narrated Abdullah ibn Abbas:
{{quote|The Prophet said: There is no prostitution in Islam. If anyone practised prostitution in pre-Islamic times, the child will be attributed to the master (of the slave-woman). He who claims his child without a valid marriage or ownership will neither inherit nor be inherited.|{{Hadith-usc|abudawud|usc=yes|12|2257}}}}

In [[Islam]], prostitution is considered a sin, and Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari is attributed with the saying: {{quote|"Allah's Apostle forbade taking the price of a dog, money earned by prostitution and the earnings of a soothsayer".|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|439}}}}

Narrated 'Urwa bin Az-Zubair:
{{quote|'Aishah, the wife of the Prophet told him that there were four types of marriage during Pre-Islamic period of Ignorance. One type was similar to that of the present day i.e. a man used to ask somebody else for the hand of a girl under his guardianship or for his daughter's hand, and give her Mahr and then marry her. The second type was that a man would say to his wife after she had become clean from her period. "Send for so-and-so and have sexual intercourse with him." Her husband would then keep awy from her and would never sleep with her till she got pregnant from the other man with whom she was sleeping. When her pregnancy became evident, he husband would sleep with her if he wished. Her husband did so (i.e. let his wife sleep with some other man) so that he might have a child of noble breed. Such marriage was called as Al-Istibda'. Another type of marriage was that a group of less than ten men would assemble and enter upon a woman, and all of them would have sexual relation with her. If she became pregnant and delivered a child and some days had passed after delivery, she would sent for all of them and none of them would refuse to come, and when they all gathered before her, she would say to them, "You (all) know what you have done, and now I have given birth to a child. So, it is your child so-and-so!" naming whoever she liked, and her child would follow him and he could not refuse to take him. The fourth type of marriage was that many people would enter upon a lady and she would never refuse anyone who came to her. Those were the prostitutes who used to fix flags at their doors as sign, and he who would wished, could have sexual intercourse with them. If anyone of them got pregnant and delivered a child, then all those men would be gathered for her and they would call the Qa'if (persons skilled in recognizing the likeness of a child to his father) to them and would let the child follow the man (whom they recognized as his father) and she would let him adhere to him and be called his son. The man would not refuse all that. But when Muhammad was sent with the Truth, he abolished all the types of marriages observed in pre-Islamic period of Ignorance except the type of marriage the people recognize today.|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|1|62|58}}}}

However, [[sexual slavery]] as concubinage was not considered prostitution and was very common during the [[Arab slave trade]] throughout the Middle Ages and [[early modern period]], when women and girls from the [[Caucasus]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Europe]] were captured and served as [[concubine]]s in the [[harem]]s of the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Slavery in Islam|publisher=|accessdate=11 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521234122/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|archivedate=21 May 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Battuta]] tells us several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122171200/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/ibn_battuta/Slavery.html |date=2009-11-22 }}.

According to [[Shia]] Muslims, Muhammad sanctioned [[Nikah mut‘ah|fixed-term marriage]] – muta'a in [[Iraq]] and [[sigheh]] in [[Iran]] — which has instead been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

By contrast, in the Sahih al-Bukhari, Mut'ah marriage is classed as forbidden because [[Ali bin Abu Talib]] said that he heard Muhammad say that it is forbidden. 
As narrated by 'Ali bin Abu Talib: 
{{quote|"On the day of khaibar, Allah's Apostle forbade the Mut'a (i.e. temporary marriage) and the eating of donkey-meat."|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|59|527}}, {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|9|86|91}}}}

Zaidi Shia texts also state that Ali said Mut'ah marriage was forbidden and for this reason the Zaidi Shia do not practise Mut'ah marriage.

==Gender non-conforming people==
{{main|LGBT in Islam|Mukhannathun}}
[[Mukhannathun]] (مخنثون "effeminate ones", "men who resemble women", singular mukhannath) were men who acted in ways interpreted as feminine. As time went on, the ''mukhannathun'' were forced to be castrated. There has been significant mention of "mukhannathun" in ahadith and by scholars of Islam. The word refers to a person who behaves like a woman in gentleness, speech, appearance, movements and so on. The mukhannath or effeminate man is one who is obviously male, unlike the khuntha (intersex). Effeminate people are of two types.
(i)Those who are created that way (intersex); there is no sin on them.
(ii)Those who were not created that way; rather they choose to imitate women in their movements and speech. This is the type which is cursed in the [[hadith]]s.&lt;ref name=intersexmarriage/&gt;
The following tradition speaks to the their behavior:
{{quotation|Narrated by Abdullah ibn Abbas: The Prophet cursed effeminate men; those men who are in the similitude (assume the manners of women) and those women who assume the manners of men, and he said, "Turn them out of your houses." The Prophet turned out such-and-such man, and 'Umar turned out such-and-such woman.|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|774}}}}
[[Sex change operation]] means that healthy males or females suffering from no deformity, who are able to marry and [[reproduce]], choose to undergo elective surgery to transform themselves into the appearance of the opposite sex. This kind of surgery is prohibited by [[Islamic Law]] because it is altering Allah’s creation needlessly and in vanity. Allah relates that [[Satan]] says:{{quotation| “And I shall order them and they will alter Allah’s creation.” |[Sûrah al-Nisâ’:119]}} 
It is also the most extreme form of imitating the opposite sex. Islamic prophet Muhammad said:&lt;ref name=islamtoday/&gt;
{{quote|“Allah curses men who imitate women and women who imitate men.”|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|773}}}}

==Intersex==
{{see|Intersex people and religion#Islam}}
An [[intersex]] person may have [[sex characteristics]] or [[sex organ|organs]] that are not typically male or female. This person is called a ''Khunthaa'' in the books of Fiqh.&lt;ref name=Khuntha&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/81691|title=View on Transgender - IslamQA|date=9 May 2015|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507020847/http://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/81691|archivedate=7 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three types of Khunthaa:

1. A person has aspects of both organs, and urinates from the male organ. This person will be included among the males and the laws regarding males will fall on him.

2. The person urinates from the female organ so will be included among the females. The laws related to females will fall on this person. This applies before the person reaches maturity. After maturity, the person will be rechecked. If he experiences wet dreams like a male then he will be counted as a male. On the other hand, if the person develops breasts and other signs of being feminine the she will be included among the females.

3. When both masculine and feminine signs are equal and it cannot be determined whether the person is more male or more female then such a person is termed Khunthaa Mushkil. There are different laws regarding such a person, a few examples: It is not permissible for a Khunthaa Mushkil to wear silk and jewellery. Both these are permissible for females. But because this person’s condition cannot be ascertained, so precaution demands that such a person not wear silk and jewellery, because of the possibility that the person may be more male. Such a person cannot travel without a Mahram because of the possibility of being more female. When this person dies, Ghusl will not be given because the question arises that who will render the Ghusl, male or female. The law is that this person will be given Tayammum. If a Ghayr Mahram is rendering the Tayammum then the person has to wear a cloth over the hands. A Mahram does not have to wear a cloth over the hands.&lt;ref name=Khuntha/&gt;

With regard to marriage of one who is intersex, if it is an unambiguous case, then according to how he or she is classified, he or she may marry someone of the opposite gender. If it is an ambiguous case, then the marriage of such a person cannot be valid, the reason being that he may be male, in which case how can he marry another male, or may be female, in which case she can't marry another female like her. If this individual is sexually attracted to females and claims to be a man, this is a sign that he is most likely male, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=intersexmarriage&gt;{{cite web|url=https://islamqa.info/en/114670|title=Ruling on marrying a man who is intersex or impotent, and the difference between them|website=www.islamqa.info|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829203522/https://islamqa.info/en/114670|archivedate=2017-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Intersex medical interventions]] are considered permissible to achieve agreement between a person’s exterior, [[chromosomal]] make-up or sex organs. They are regarded as treatment and not the altering of Allah’s creation or imitation of the opposite sex.&lt;ref name=islamtoday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.islamtoday.net/node/1334|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107021853/http://en.islamtoday.net/node/1334|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-01-07|title=Sex change operation - IslamToday - English|website=en.islamtoday.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concubinage ==
{{main|Ma malakat aymanukum}}
{{See also|Islamic views on slavery#Sexual intercourse}}

Concubinage was a relationship between a man and an unmarried female slave whom he owns; the term refers to the status of the female. If she gives birth to a child by her master, the slave becomes ''umm walad'' ("mother of child", "concubine"). The [[Hanbali]] jurist [[Ibn Qudama]] explains that the father is not allowed to sell or transfer ownership of his concubine, though he is entitled to have sexual relations with her, to employ her service, to hire her out and to marry her. [[Ibn al-Humam]] adds that the slave-owner must acknowledge the kinship of the child.&lt;ref name="Suad 2006"/&gt;

"Concubine" (''surriyya'') refers to the female slave (''jāriya''), whether Muslim or non-Muslim, with whom her master engages in sexual intercourse. The word "''surriyya''" is not mentioned in the Qur'an. However, the expression "[[Ma malakat aymanukum]]" (that which your right hands own), which occurs fifteen times in the sacred book, refers to slaves and therefore, though not necessarily, to concubines.{{additional citation needed|date=November 2016}} Concubinage was a pre-Islamic custom that was allowed to be practiced under Islam with Jews and non-Muslim people  to marry concubine after teaching her and instructing her well and then giving them  freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quranx.com/Hadith/adab/In-Book/Book-9/Hadith-48/ | title=Al-Adab Al-Mufrad / Book-9 / Hadith-48 | publisher=quranx.com | accessdate=7 June 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217062833/http://quranx.com/Hadith/adab/In-Book/Book-9/Hadith-48/ | archivedate=17 February 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{additional citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Islamic jurisprudence sets limits on the master's right to sexual intercourse with his female slave. A man's ownership of his unmarried slave-girl gave him an exclusive right to have sex with her that he could not sell to others (in order to prevent prostitution of slaves). A man could own a limitless number of concubines, but could not have access to the slave-girls owned by his wife. Marriage between the master and his concubine was only possible if she was granted free status first. To avoid pregnancies, the master had the right to practice [[coitus interruptus]]. The birth of progeny would change the legal status of the concubine to that of ''umm al-walad'' ("mother of the child"); as such, the concubine could not then be sold. On the (lawful) death of her master, she would automatically acquire free status and her children would be considered free and legitimate.&lt;ref name="Suad 2006"/&gt;

Surah [[Al-Muminun]] (23:6) and Surah [[Al-Maarij]] (70:30) both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and "those whom one's right hands possess" (female slaves), saying " أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ" (literally, "their spouses or what their right hands possess"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible. The purchase of female slaves for sex was lawful from the perspective of Islamic law, and this was the most common motive for the purchase of slaves throughout Islamic history.&lt;ref name="Brunschvig"&gt;Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, Brill, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

One rationale given for recognition of concubinage in Islam is that "it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]."&lt;ref name="Sikainga 1996 p22"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sikainga, Ahmad A. | title=Slaves Into Workers: Emancipation and Labor in Colonial Sudan | publisher=University of Texas Press | year=1996 | isbn=0-292-77694-2}} p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Most schools restrict concubinage to a relationship where the female slave is required to be monogamous to her master&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bloom, Jonathan |author2=Blair, Sheila | title=Islam: A Thousand Years of Faith and Power | publisher=Yale University Press | year=2002| isbn=0-300-09422-1}} p.48&lt;/ref&gt;  (though the master's monogamy to her is not required), but according to Sikainga, "in reality, however, female slaves in many Muslim societies were prey for [male] members of their owners' household, their [owner's male] neighbors, and their [owner's male] guests."&lt;ref name="Sikainga 1996 p22"/&gt;

The history of slavery in Islamic states and of sexual relations with slaves, was the "responsibility of Muslims, and not of the Quran", according to Parwez,{{who|date=January 2017}} as quoted by Clarence-Smith.&lt;ref name=csp198&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarence-Smith|first1=William|title=Islam and the Abolition of Slavery|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195221516|pages=198–200|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nQbylEdqJKkC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=slavery+quran#v=onepage&amp;q=translation&amp;f=false|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611073330/https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nQbylEdqJKkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=slavery+quran&amp;ots=CmLKAHzroo&amp;sig=qkVj_OulU-TNieKvSJk6ybw8NUc#v=onepage&amp;q=translation&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-06-11|df=|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amir Ali blamed the history of Islamic slavery in racist terms, states Clarence-Smith, stating that slave servitude and sexual abuse of captive slaves may have been because of degeneration of the Arabs from their admixing over time with "lower races such as Ethiopians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarence-Smith|first1=William|title=Islam and the Abolition of Slavery|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195221516|pages=199–201|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nQbylEdqJKkC|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160429200313/https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=nQbylEdqJKkC&amp;f=false|archivedate=2016-04-29|df=|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rape ==

According to Islamic law, it is classified as ''[[hirabah]]'', i.e. a violent crime causing disorder in the land in the manner described in the Qur'an as ''[[fasad]]'' (destructive mischief). A similar crime, for example, would be [[highway robbery]], as it puts fear in people going out or losing their property through violence. Some other branches of Islamic law consider it to be part of ''[[zina]]'', as a crime called "forced fornication" (''zina-bil-jabr''). In Sharia, rape is punishable by [[stoning]] to death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jami` at-Tirmidhi]], [http://sunnah.com/ tirmidhi/17 17:37] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020025409/http://www.sunnah.com/ |date=2015-10-20 }}, {{Hadith-usc|abudawud|

Under Islam, sexual intercourse is regarded as a loving act within marriage and should only be by mutual consent.{{additional citation| date=January 2017}} There is, however, no explicit concept of rape within marriage in Sharia; a wife is deemed to have accepted conjugal relations as part of the marriage contract. She can only refuse on grounds which are specified as prohibited for sexual intercourse such as when she is fasting, menstruating, undergoing [[Postpartum period|post-natal puerperal discharge]], or whilst on [[Hajj]] or [[Umrah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Classical Islamic law defined what today is commonly called "rape" as a coercive form of fornication or adultery (''zināʾ'').&lt;ref name="Kassam"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0075 |title= The Oxford Encyclopedia of Islam and Law |last=Kassam |first=Zayn |date= |website= |publisher= Oxford Islamic Studies Online |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113724/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0075 |archive-date= 2016-03-04 |dead-url=no |accessdate= 3 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This basic definition of rape as "coercive ''zināʾ''" meant that all the normal legal principles that pertained to ''zināʾ''{{spaced ndash}}its definition, punishment and establishment through evidence{{spaced ndash}}were also applicable to rape; the prototypical act of ''zināʾ'' was defined as sexual intercourse between a man and a woman over whom the man has neither a conjugal nor an ownership right.&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt; Sane adult male and female convicted of ''zināʾ'' were to receive a fixed corporal punishment (''ḥadd''):

* One hundred lashes and exile for one year for unmarried free persons;
* Stoning to death for married or previously married free persons;

''Zināʾ'' was established, according to classical law, through confession by one or both parties as well as proof. A second type of evidence{{spaced ndash}}pregnancy in an unmarried/unowned woman{{spaced ndash}} was contested between the schools. The stringent evidentiary and procedural standards for implementing the zināʾ punishment may have functioned to offset the severity of the punishment itself, an effect that seems to have been intended by legal authorities, who in the early period developed legal maxims encouraging averting the ḥadd punishments as much as possible, whether through claiming ambiguity (shubhah) or a lack of legal capacity (ahliyya).&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt;

What distinguished a prototypical act of zināʾ from an act of rape, for the jurists, was that in the prototypical case, both parties act out of their own volition, while in an act of rape, only one of the parties does so. Jurists admitted a wide array of situations as being "coercive" in nature, including the application of physical force, the presence of duress, or the threat of future harm either to oneself or those close to oneself; they also included in their definition of "coercion" the inability to give valid consent, as in the case of minors, or mentally ill or unconscious persons. Muslim jurists from the earliest period of Islamic law agreed that perpetrators of coercive ''zināʾ'' should receive the ''ḥadd'' punishment normally applicable to their personal status and sexual status, but that the ḥadd punishment should not be applied to victims of coercive or nonconsensual ''zināʾ'' due to their reduced capacity.&lt;ref name="Kassam"/&gt;

According to the Mālikī, Ḥanbalī, and Shāfiʾī schools of law, the rape of a free woman consisted of not one but two violations: a violation against a "right of God" (''ḥaqq Allāh''), provoking the ''ḥadd'' punishment; and a violation against a "human" (interpersonal) right (''ḥaqq ādamī''), requiring a monetary compensation. {{additional citation|date=January 2017}} These jurists saw the free woman, in her proprietorship over her own sexuality (''buḍʾ''), as not unlike the slave-owner who owns the sexuality of his female slave.

== Restrictions on sexual intercourse ==

Sexual intercourse is prohibited:
* during menstruation;
* for forty days after childbirth ([[puerperium]]);
* during the daylight hours of the month of [[Ramadan]] (i.e. while fasting);
* on pilgrimage; while in the sanctuary (in Ahram) at Mecca, pilgrims are not allowed to have intercourse.

== Sodomy ==
{{main|Islamic view of anal sex}}

[[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]], a contemporary [[Sunni]] [[List of modern-day Muslim scholars|Muslim scholar]], states that [[sodomy]] is [[Haraam|prohibited]].  As the act is forbidden in the [[Islamic marriage contract]], a wife must abstain from it should her husband demand it and may seek divorce if her husband persists or tries to force it on her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543866 |title=When Husband Insists on Anal Sex with His Wife - ارشيف اسلام اونلاين |publisher= |accessdate=11 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215054059/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503543866 |archivedate=15 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The act in itself, however, does not [[:wikt:nullify|nullify]] the marriage and the wife must seek divorce if she is to leave her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503547172 |title=Anal Sex with the Wife: Does It Nullify Marriage? - ارشيف اسلام اونلاين |publisher= |accessdate=11 December 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215054251/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503547172 |archivedate=15 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim scholars justify the prohibition on the basis of the Qur'anic verse 2:223, saying that it commands intercourse only in the vagina (i.e. potentially procreational intercourse). The vaginal intercourse may be in any manner the couple wishes, that is, from behind or from the front, sitting or with the wife lying on her back or on her side.

There are also several ''hadith'' which prohibit sodomy.

Islamic law establishes two categories of legal, sexual relationships: between husband and wife, and between a man and his concubine. All other sexual relationships are considered ''zināʾ'' (fornication), including adultery and homosexuality, according to Islamic law and exegesis of the Qur'an. From the story of [[Lot in Islam|Lot]] it is clear that the Qur'an regards sodomy as an egregious sin. The death by stoning for people of Sodom and Gomorrah is similar to the stoning punishment stipulated for illegal heterosexual sex. There is no punishment for a man who sodomizes a woman because it is not tied to procreation. However, other jurists insist that any act of lust in which the result is the injecting of semen into another person constitutes sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Suad 2006"/&gt;

Sodomy often falls under that same category as sex between and unmarried man and women engaging in sexual acts. Male-male intercourse is referred to as ''liwat'' (literally, "joining") while female-female intercourse is referred to as ''sihaq'' (literally, "rubbing"). Both are considered reprehensible acts but there is no consensus on punishment for either. Some jurists define ''zināʾ'' exclusively as the act of unlawful vaginal penetration, hence categorizing and punishing anal penetration in different ways. Other jurists included both vaginal and anal penetration within the definition of ''zināʾ'' and hence extended the punishment of the one to the other.&lt;ref name="Omar"/&gt;
Religious discourse has mostly focused on sexual acts, which are unambiguously condemned. The Qur'an refers explicitly to male-male sexual relations only in the context of the story of Lot, but labels the Sodomites's actions (universally understood in the later tradition as anal intercourse) an "abomination" (female-female relations are not addressed). Reported pronouncements by Muhammad (''hadith'') reinforce the interdiction on male-male sodomy, although there are no reports of his ever adjudicating an actual case of such an offense; he is also quoted as condemning cross-gender behavior for both sexes, but it is unclear to what extent this is to be understood as involving sexual relations. Several early caliphs, confronted with cases of sodomy between males, are said to have had both partners executed, by a variety of means. While taking such precedents into account, medieval jurists were unable to achieve a consensus on this issue; some legal schools prescribed capital punishment for sodomy, but others opted only for a relatively mild discretionary punishment. There was general agreement, however, that other homosexual acts (including any between females) were lesser offenses, subject only to discretionary punishment.&lt;ref name="Rowson"/&gt;

Currently, sodomy is punishable by death in a number of Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia and Yemen, as well as in Nigeria's Sharia courts.&lt;ref name="Omar"/&gt;

==Oral sex==
{{main|Islamic views on oral sex}}
In Islam, [[oral sex]] between a husband and wife is considered "Makruh Tahrimi"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ask The Scholar: What is meant by makruh?|url=http://askthescholar.com/question-details.aspx?qstID=1750|work=Shaik Ahmad Kutty|publisher=Ahmad Kutty|accessdate=7 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20120709204156/http://askthescholar.com/question-details.aspx?qstID=1750|archivedate=9 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or highly undesirable by some Islamic jurists when the act is defined as mouth and tongue coming in contact with the genitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral Sex in Islam|url=http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/OralSexInIslam.htm|work=The Majlis|publisher=JamiatKZN, Central-Mosque.com|accessdate=7 July 2012|location=Vol. 6 No. 8|date=14 June 2003|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120614230937/http://www.central-mosque.com/fiqh/OralSexInIslam.htm|archivedate=14 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moulana Ismail Desai"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are partners allowed to lick each other's private parts?|url=http://www.askimam.org/public/question_detail/21483#_ftnref1|work=Mawlana Saeed Ahmed Golaub|publisher=Moulana Ismail  Desai|accessdate=9 October 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004191016/http://askimam.org/public/question_detail/21483#_ftnref1|archivedate=4 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason behind considering this act as not recommended is manifold, the foremost being the issue of modesty, purification ([[Ritual purity in Islam|Taharat]]) and cleanliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions On Sexuality, Oral sex|url=http://www.livingislam.org/fiqhi/fiqha_e92.html#2|work=Living Islam|publisher=GF Haddad|accessdate=7 July 2012|author=Hajj Gibril|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620140054/http://www.livingislam.org/fiqhi/fiqha_e92.html#2|archivedate=20 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purification and hygiene ==
{{main|Islamic sexual hygienical jurisprudence}}

After partaking in sexual activity where penetration or ejaculation occurs, both men and women are required to complete a full-body ritual [[Ablution in Islam|ablution]] known as ''[[ghusl]]'' in order to re-establish ritual purity before prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali |first=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: feminist reflections on Qur'an, hadith, and jurisprudence |year=2006 |publisher=Oneworld |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ghusl'' requires clean, odorless water that has not been used for a previous ritual and begins with the declaration of the intention of purity and worship.&lt;ref name="Esposito"&gt;{{cite web |last=Esposito |first=John |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e4 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=3 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114153249/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t243/e4 |archivedate=14 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Muslim performing complete ablution then washes every part of his or her body.&lt;ref name="Esposito"/&gt;

== Fasting and Ramadan ==

{{quote|It is made lawful to you to go into your wives on the night of the fast; they are an apparel for you and you are an apparel for them; Allah knew that you acted unfaithfully to yourselves, so He has turned to you (mercifully) and removed from you (this burden); so now be in contact with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you, and eat and drink until the whiteness of the day becomes distinct from the blackness of the night at dawn, then complete the fast till night, and have not contact with them while you keep to the mosques; these are the limits of Allah, so do not go near them. Thus does Allah make clear His communications for men that they may guard (against evil).|{{cite quran|2|187|t=s|s=ns}}}}

According to Qura'nic verse 2:187, one may have sex during the month of Ramadan but not during the time of fasting.

== Menstruation ==

{{quote|And they ask you about menstruation. Say: It is an illness; therefore keep aloof from the women during the menstrual discharge and do not go near them until they have become clean; then when they have cleansed themselves, go in to them as Allah has commanded you; surely Allah loves those who turn much (to Him), and He loves those who purify themselves.|{{cite quran|2|222|t=s|s=ns}}}}

Verse 2:222 in the Qur'an implies that sexual relations during menstruation are prohibited.

==Nocturnal emission==
{{main|Nocturnal emission#Islamic view}}
Nocturnal emission is not a sin in Islam. Moreover, whereas a person fasting (in [[Ramadan]] or otherwise) would normally be considered to have broken their fast by ejaculating on purpose (during either masturbation or intercourse), nocturnal emission is not such a cause. They are still required to bathe prior to undergoing some rituals in the religion. Muslim scholars consider ejaculation something that makes one temporarily ritually impure, a condition known as [[junub]]; meaning that a [[Muslim]] who has had an orgasm or ejaculated must have a ''[[ghusl]]'', before they can read the [[Qur'an]] or perform the formal prayer known as [[salat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/9208|title=Coping with wet dreams|publisher=www.islampqa.info|accessdate=11 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102104301/https://islamqa.info/en/9208|archivedate=2 January 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an has been cited as being ambiguous on the issue of masturbation. The hadith regarding masturbation are, too, not considered to take a definitive stance on the subject. As such, positions on masturbation vary widely.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"&gt;{{cite web |last=Omar |first=Sara |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114153420/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0011 |archivedate=2016-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to alDin Tarbiyyah, it is permissible if done out of necessity.&lt;ref&gt;Islam, Gender, and Social Change - Page 28, Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad, John L. Esposito - 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He also permitted masturbation as a means whereby soldiers, far away from their wives on a tour of duty may remain chaste. The four [[Sunni]] schools of [[jurisprudence]] (known as Madhaahib - the ''Hanafi'', ''Shafi'i'', ''Maliki'' and ''Hanbali'' schools of ''Fiqh'') have differing stances on the issue. Some see it forbidden in certain cases (i.e. if it leads a man/woman to ignore their spouse sexually) but recommended it when they see it as a lesser evil to illicit sex. It is generally prohibited according to the [[Hanafi]] and [[Hanbali]] Mazhabs, unless one fears adultery or fornication, or is under the desire pressure, in which case, it is permissible to seek a relief through masturbation. According to Ahmed ibn Hanbal, it is permissible for prisoners, travellers and for men and women who have difficulty in finding a lawful spouse.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It is prohibited all the time according to the [[Maliki]] and [[Shafi`i]] Mazhabs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nikah.com/marriage/islam_part1.asp Marriage in Islam - Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127060711/http://nikah.com/marriage/islam_part1.asp |date=2010-11-27 }} by Hussein Khalid Al-Hussein, Ph.D. Refer to: Section Al-`Alaqat Al-Mubahah (Allowed Relationships)&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[haram]] in [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] jurisprudence.&lt;ref name= "Shia"/&gt; There has always been a view to permit masturbation as the lesser of two evils (so as to ward of falling into fornication).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Inhorn |first=Marcia |title=Masturbation, Semen Collection and Men's IVF Experiences: Anxieties in |journal=Body &amp; Society |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it is categorically incorrect to state that all Islamic scholars of the early Islamic age have unanimously agreed upon its complete prohibition. Jurists distinguish between those who masturbate out of necessity and those who have these means yet still masturbate to gratify their lust.&lt;ref name="oxfordislamicstudies.com"/&gt;

== Contraception ==

The Qur'an does not contain explicit text regarding contraception. Muslims refer to the hadith on the question of contraception. According to Muslim scolars, birth control is permitted, when it is temporary and for a valid reason.&lt;ref name="amjaonline"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dr. Hatem al-Haj |title=Fatwa-76792 -  Getting my tubes tied: female sterilization |url=http://www.amjaonline.org/fatwa-76792/info |website=www.amjaonline.org |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The companions of Muhammad are cited when addressing this issue. For example, Jabir, one of Muhammad's companions, relates a hadith in which a man came to Muhammad and said {{Quote|"I have a slave girl, and we need her as a servant and around the palm groves. I have had sex with her, but I am afraid of her becoming pregnant." The Prophet responded, ″Practice [[coitus interruptus]] with her if you so wish, for she will receive what has been predestined for her.″&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sachedina |first=Zulie |title=Islam, Procreation and the Law |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |year=1990 |volume=16 |issue=3 |jstor=2133308 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} As such, the withdrawal method of contraception is allowed according to the hadith. Muslim jurists concur with its permissibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ali |first=Kecia |title=Sexual ethics and Islam: feminist reflections on Qur'an, hadith, and jurisprudence |year=2006 |publisher=Oneworld |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use analogical deduction to approve other forms of contraception (e.g. [[condom]] usage).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Esposito |first=John |title=Oxford Islamic Studies Online |url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e358 |publisher=Oxford University Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201230901/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e358 |archivedate=2014-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting [[Sunnah]] include:

{{Quote|A man said: "Apostle of Allah, I have a slave-girl and I withdraw from her (while having intercourse), and I dislike that she becomes pregnant. I intend (by intercourse) what the men intend by it. The Jews say that withdrawal method (Al-azl) is like burying the living girls on a small scale." He (the Prophet) said: "The Jews told a lie. If Allah intends to create it, you cannot turn it away."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|11|2166}}&lt;/ref&gt;|{{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|abudawud|11|2166}}}}

{{Quote|"O Allah's Apostle! We get female captives as our share of booty, and we are interested in their prices, what is your opinion about coitus interruptus?" The Prophet said, "Do you really do that? It is better for you not to do it. No soul that which Allah has destined to exist, but will surely come into existence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|432}}&lt;/ref&gt;|{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|432}}}}
===Sterilization===
It is not permitted to carry out operations on men or women that will lead to complete sterility, such as cutting the vas deferens ([[vasectomy]]) in men, or removing the ovaries or womb ([[hysterectomy]] or [[Tubal ligation|ligation]]) in women. Irreversible methods of contraception and birth control called [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] are not allowed for both male and female, except in the case of the wife who becomes terminally ill and perpetually incapable of having babies.&lt;ref name="Iqainfo-sterility"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid]] |title=Ruling on surgery that causes sterility |url=https://islamqa.info/en/2160 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |accessdate=13 September 2018 |date=1998-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, if the sterilization is irreversible and cannot be undone, it will not be permissible unless the woman is terminally ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Yusuf Laher |title=Are Muslim women allowed to have sterilization? |url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/askmufti/44911 |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=IQS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under normal circumstances, sterilization is considered to be absolutely and decidedly prohibited in Shari’ah. The irreversible nature associated with both the male and female sterilizations clearly contradicts one of the primary purposes of marriage which is to have children, as mentioned by [[Abu Hamid al-Ghazali]] in his [[Ihya’ Ulum al-Din]]. 
Furthermore, sterilization is a form of mutilation of one’s body (muthla), which has been clearly forbidden in the Shari’ah. Allah Most High mentions in [[An-Nisa]] the words of [[Satan]], when he said:

{{Quote|“I will mislead them, and I will create in them false desires; I will order them to slit the ears of cattle and to deface the (fair) nature created by Allah.”|[[An-Nisa]]:119}}

However, in cases of absolute necessity, sterilization does become permitted. The well-known principle of Islamic jurisprudence based on the guidelines of the Qur’an and Hadith states: {{Quote|“Necessities make prohibitions lawful.”| (Ibn Nujaym, Al-Ashbah wa al-Naza’ir 85)}}&lt;ref name="DI"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Muhammad ibn Adam |title=Permanent Contraception (Female Sterlisation) - Does Intention affect Permissibility? |url=http://www.daruliftaa.com/node/5114?txt_QuestionID |website=[[Darul Ifta]] |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=02-08-2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being sterilized permanently may mean one of two things: 
# – It may be done out of necessity, such as if it is determined by trustworthy medicinal evidence that pregnancy will pose a danger to the mother’s life, and there is no hope of a cure, so permanent sterilization will ward off that danger. In this case it is permissible to be sterilized. 
# – When there is no need for it. Undoubtedly in this case it is a criminal act and a major sin, because it is a transgression against the creation of Allaah for no reason, and preventing the production of offspring which was encouraged by the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and being ungrateful for the blessing of children which Allaah bestows upon His creation. And it is not permissible to do anything that will put a stop to pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;It says in al-Insaaf: It says in al-Faa’iq (1/383).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Islamic Fiqh Council]] stated the following: 

{{Quote|It is haraam to sterilize both men and women, if there is no necessary reason for doing so unless there is a necessity which is to be determined according to the guidelines set out by sharee’ah. It is permissible to take temporary measures to space pregnancies or prevent them for a limited period of time, if there is a legitimate shar’i need to do so, so long as this decision is made on the basis of mutual consultation and approval between the spouses. That is subject to the condition that no harm should result from that, and that the means should be acceptable according to sharee’ah, and that there should be no harm caused to an existing pregnancy.|Islamic Fiqh Council, report no. 39 (1/5)}}

Based on this, if preventing pregnancy is for a legitimate reason as outlined above, then there is nothing to do anything. But if it was not for a necessary reason, then sterilizing is prohibited.&lt;ref name="IQA3"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih Al-Munajjid]] |title=She had injections to make her infertile – what is the ruling on that? |url=https://islamqa.info/en/47196 |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=2004-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iqs"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid]] |title=Ruling on having one’s tubes tied or having a hysterectomy because pregnancy exhausts her and temporary methods of contraception do not work for h |url=https://islamqa.info/en/258382 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |accessdate=10 September 2018 |date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Castration==
[[Castration]] is removal of the testicles. The Arabic word translated here as castration may also refer to removal of the testicles and penis. Some scholars differentiated between the two and said: If his testicles only are cut off, then he is a eunuch; if his penis is cut off, then he is emasculated. 
It is prohibited for a person to do that deliberately to himself or to someone else. Castration of the human is prohibited in Islam, whether he is a child or an adult, because of the prohibition on hadith on that.&lt;ref name="IQA.org"&gt;{{cite web |title=Is Castration Permissible? |url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/mahmoodiyah/53845 |website=Islamqa.org |accessdate=9 October 2018 |date=20 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Hajar]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} said:
{{quote|it is prohibited, therefore it is haraam, and there is no difference of opinion concerning that in the case of the sons of Adam (i.e., humans).}} 
Among the reports that confirm this prohibition is the following prophet Muhammad's era, when some followers wanted to be castrated in abstance of their wives, but the prophet forbade it and permitted three days [[Nikah mut'ah|temporary marriage]] for them for a certain period, but after the period he declered it permanently forbidden: 

{{quote|Abdullah (b. Mas'ud) reported: We were on an expedition with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and we had no women with us. We said: Should we not have ourselves castrated? He (the Holy Prophet) forbade us to do so He then granted us permission that we should contract temporary marriage for a stipulated period giving her a garment, and 'Abdullah then recited this verse: 'Those who believe do not make unlawful the good things which Allah has made lawful for you, and do not transgress. Allah does not like trangressers" (al-Qur'an, v. 87).|[[Sahih Bukhari]], Chapter: 62, Hadith no: 11, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1404}}}}

{{quote|Sabra al-Juhanni reported on the authority of his father that while he was with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon hm) he said: 0 people, I had permitted you to contract temporary marriage with women, but Allah has forbidden it (now) until the Day of Resurrection. So he who has any (woman with this type of marriage contract) he should let her off, and do not take back anything you have given to then (as dower).|[[Sahih Muslim]]: Book 008, Number 3255}}

{{quote|According to the hadeeth of Sa‘d ibn Abi Waqqaas: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) forbade ‘Uthmaan ibn Maz’oon to be celibate. If he had given him permission, we would have gotten ourselves castrated.|[[Sahih Bukhari]], Chapter: 62, Hadith no: 12, {{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1402}}}}

{{quote|It was narrated from Salamah bin Rawh bin Zinba', that : his grandfather came to the Prophet and he had castrated a slave of his. The Prophet manumitted the slave in compensation for having been mutilated.|[https://sunnah.com/ibnmajah/21 Ibn Majah, Vol. 3, Book 21, Hadith 2679]}}

{{quote|Narrated Qatadah: Samurah reported the Messenger of Allah as saying: Whoever kills his slave we shall kill him, and whoever cuts the nose of his slave we shall cut off his nose. If anyone castrates his slave, we shall castrate him.|[https://sunnah.com/abudawud/41 Sunan Abi Dawud 4516], [[Bulugh Al-Maram]]: [https://sunnah.com/bulugh/9Book 9, Hadith 120]}}

[[Ibn Hajar]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} said, commenting on these hadiths: 

The reason behind the prohibition on castration is that it is contrary to what the Lawgiver wants of increasing reproduction to ensure continuation of struggle against the [[Kafir|disbelievers]]. Otherwise, if permission had been given for that, then many people would have done that, and reproduction would have ceased, and the numbers of Muslims would have become less as a result, and the numbers of non-muslims would have increased, and that is contrary to the religious purpose.&lt;ref name="IQAC"&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid]] |title=126987: The ruling on castration |url=https://islamqa.info/en/126987 |website=[[Islamqa.info]] |date=2015-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In vitro fertilization==
Regarding the response to [[In Vitro Fertilization]] (IVF) of [[Islam]], the conclusions of Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak's ART fatwa include that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://vlex.com/vid/fatwas-ivf-gamete-sunni-shia-islam-418643 | last = Inhorn | first = MC | title = Making Muslim babies: IVF and gamete donation in Sunni versus Shi'a Islam | journal = Cult Med Psychiatry | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 427–50 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17051430 | pmc = 1705533 | doi = 10.1007/s11013-006-9027-x | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090624121701/http://vlex.com/vid/fatwas-ivf-gamete-sunni-shia-islam-418643 | archivedate = 2009-06-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*IVF of an egg from the wife with the sperm of her husband and the transfer of the fertilised egg back to the uterus of the wife is allowed, provided that the procedure is indicated for a medical reason and is carried out by an expert physician.
*Since marriage is a contract between the wife and husband during the span of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital functions of sex and procreation. This means that a third party donor is not acceptable, whether he or she is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a uterus. The use of a third party is tantamount to ''zina'', or [[adultery]].

== Abortion ==
{{main|Islam and abortion}}

Islamic schools of law have differing opinions on abortion, though it is prohibited or discouraged by most.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sachedina |first=Zulie |title=Islam, Procreation and the Law |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |year=1990 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, abortion is allowed under certain circumstances, such as if the mother's health is [seriously] threatened. If the abortion is necessary to save the woman's life, Muslims universally agree that her life takes precedence over the life of the fetus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donna Lee |last=Bowen |chapter=Contemporary Muslim Ethics of Abortion |editor-first=Jonathan E. |editor-last=Brockopp |title=Islamic ethics of life: abortion, war, and euthanasia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=agqtUUoOgQoC |year=2003 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001185028/https://books.google.com/books?id=agqtUUoOgQoC&amp;PA=88 |archivedate=2015-10-01 |df= |isbn=9781570034718 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim jurists allow abortion in this context based on the principle that what is considered the greater evil{{spaced ndash}}the woman's death{{spaced ndash}}should be warded off by accepting the lesser evil of abortion. In these cases, the physician is considered a better judge than the scholar. Abortions of pregnancies that are merely unplanned or unwanted are generally ''haram'' (forbidden). The Qur'an forbids the abortion of a fetus for fear of poverty:

{{quote|...kill not your children on a plea of want; We provide sustenance for you and for them|{{cite quran|6|151|s=ns}}}}
{{quote|Kill not your children for fear of want: We shall provide sustenance for them as well as for you: verily the killing of them is a great sin.|{{cite quran|17|31|s=ns}}}}

Muslim views on abortion are also shaped by the [[Hadith]] as well as by the opinions of legal and religious scholars and commentators. In Islam, the fetus is believed to become a living soul after four months of gestation,&lt;ref&gt;"''(The matter of the Creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the mother in forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period, and then a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then Allah sends an angel who is ordered to write four things...then the soul is breathed into him''"&lt;br&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|4|54|430}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abortion after that point is generally viewed as impermissible. Many Islamic thinkers recognize exceptions to this rule for certain circumstances; indeed, [[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]] notes that "the majority of Muslim scholars permit abortion, although they differ on the stage of fetal development beyond which it becomes prohibited."&lt;ref name="USAToday"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-08-13-forum-abortion_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |title=Where does God stand on abortion? |first=Tom |last=Ehrich |date=August 13, 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627035106/http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-08-13-forum-abortion_x.htm |archivedate=June 27, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Sherman Jackson]], "while abortion, even during the first trimester, is forbidden according to a minority of jurists, it is not held to be an offense for which there are criminal or even civil sanctions," so Muslims should not support legal restrictions on abortion rights unsupported by Islamic law, as opposed to solely moral activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Sherman A. |last=Jackson |chapter=Blackamerica, Immigrant Islam, and the Dominant Culture |title=Islam and the Blackamerican&lt;!-- Sic --&gt;: Looking Toward the Third Resurrection |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nprKYM8sleYC&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |page=151 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426033404/https://books.google.com/books?id=nprKYM8sleYC&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2016-04-26 |df= |isbn=9780195343571 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Muslim scholars hold that the child of rape is a legitimate human being and therefore subject to the same laws of abortion (i.e. its abortion is permitted only if the fetus is less than four months old, or if it endangers the life of its mother&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://islamqa.info/en/131275 | title=Her foetus died after 66 days gestation and was miscarried after 100 days. Is her bleeding nifaas? | publisher=Islamqa.info | accessdate=24 July 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724210816/http://islamqa.info/en/131275 | archivedate=24 July 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Some scholars disagree with this position. Some Muslim scholars{{who|date=October 2016}} also argue that abortion is permitted if the newborn might be sick in some way that would make its care exceptionally difficult for the parents (e.g. deformities, mental retardation, etc.).&lt;ref name="VRC"&gt;{{cite book |first=Vardit |last=Rispler-Chaim |chapter=The Right Not To Be Born: Abortion of the Disadvantaged Fetus in Contemporary Fatwas |editor-first=Jonathan E. |editor-last=Brockopp |title=Islamic ethics of life: abortion, war, and euthanasia |url=https://books.google.com/?id=agqtUUoOgQoC |year=2003 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |pages=87–88 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001185028/https://books.google.com/books?id=agqtUUoOgQoC&amp;PA=88 |archivedate=2015-10-01 |df= |isbn=9781570034718 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=October 2016}}{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11675">{{Sexual orientation}}
The '''Klein Sexual Orientation Grid''' ('''KSOG''') developed by [[Fritz Klein (sex researcher)|Fritz Klein]] attempts to measure [[sexual orientation]] by expanding upon the earlier [[Kinsey scale]]. Klein first described the KSOG in his 1978 book ''[[The Bisexual Option]]''.&lt;ref name="Coleman1987a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=Edmond J|title=Integrated Identity for Gay Men and Lesbians: Psychotherapeutic Approaches for Emotional Well-Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfXmSHMDIBgC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=29 August 2012|date=1987-09-10|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780866566384|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newitz1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=The Bad Subjects Production Team|title=Bad Subjects: Political Education for Everyday Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6inQN6MN0-AC&amp;pg=PT108|accessdate=29 August 2012|date=1997-11-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814757932|pages=108–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bancroft2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bancroft|first=John|title=Human Sexuality And It Problems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bI-Jau14aLAC&amp;pg=PA262|accessdate=29 August 2012|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780443051616|pages=262–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klein|first=Fritz|author2=Barry Sepekoff |author3=Timothy J.

In response to the criticism of the Kinsey scale only measuring two dimensions of sexual orientation, Klein developed a multidimensional grid for describing sexual orientation. Unlike the Kinsey Scale, the Klein grid investigates sexual orientation in the past, the present and in the idealized future with respect to seven factors each, for a total of twenty-one values.

==Overview==

Introduced in Klein's book ''The Bisexual Option'' the KSOG uses a seven-point scale to assess seven different dimensions of sexuality at three different points in an individual's life: past (from early adolescence up to one year ago), present (within the last 12 months), and ideal (what would be chosen if it were voluntary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Fritz|title=The Bisexual Option|year=1993|publisher=The Haworth Press|isbn=978-1-56024-380-9|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortcomings==
{{main|Sexual orientation#Sexual orientation distinguished from sexual identity and behavior}}
{{Criticism section|date=October 2012}}
Klein, while recognizing that the grid explored many more dimensions of sexual orientation than previous scales, acknowledged that it omitted the following aspects of sexual orientation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Fritz|title=The Bisexual Option|year=1993|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Age of partner
* Differentiation of love and friendship in the emotional preference variable
* Sexual attraction being distinguished between [[sexual desire]] and [[limerence]]
* Whether [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] referred to number of partners or number of occurrences
* [[Sex role]]s as well as masculine and feminine roles

While Klein held the belief that including more dimensions of sexual orientation was better, Weinrich et al. (1993) found that all of the dimensions of the KSOG seemed to be measuring the same construct.&lt;ref name="Weinrich 1993 157–168"&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. Weinrich|title=A factor analysis of the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid in two disparate samples.|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=1993|volume=22|issue=2|pages=157–168|doi=10.1007/bf01542364|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study conducted a [[factor analysis]] of the KSOG to see how many factors emerged in two different samples. In both groups, the first factor to emerge loaded substantially on all of the grid's 21 items, indicating that this factor accounted for a majority of the variance. They further found that a second factor emerged containing time dimensions of social and emotional preferences suggesting that those dimensions may have also been measuring something other than sexual orientation. Therefore, despite the scale being helpful in promoting the concept of sexual orientation as being multidimensional and dynamic, the additional dimensions measured do not necessarily reveal any more of an accurate description of one's overall sexual orientation than the Kinsey Scale.

Another concern with the KSOG is that different dimensions of sexual orientation may not identify all people of a certain orientation in the same way. Measures of [[sexual attraction]], sexual activity, and [[sexual identity]] identify different (though often overlapping) populations. Laumann et al. (1994) found that of the 8.6% of women reporting some same gender sexuality, 88% reported same gender sexual attraction, 41% reported some same gender sexual behaviour and 16% reported a lesbian or gay identity.&lt;ref name="Laumann 1994 303"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laumann|title=The Social Organization of Sexuality|year=1994|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-46957-7|pages=303|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is not clear what exactly the scale may be measuring as depending on which aspect is taken into consideration, sexual orientation may or not be revealed.

A '''marine thruster''' is a device for producing directed [[hydrodynamic thrust]] on a marine [[vehicle]]. The thrust direction may be fixed or steerable.
Examples of marine thrusters include [[screw propeller]]s, [[Voith-Schneider propellers]], [[Pump-jet|waterjets]], [[ducted propeller]]s, tunnel [[bow thrusters]] and stern thrusters, [[azimuth thrusters]], [[rim-driven thruster]]s, [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] and [[submersible]] drive units.
Marine thrusters may be used for [[propulsion]], [[Maneuver (ship control)|maneuvering]] and [[Steering#Watercraft steering|steering]], [[Attitude control (submersibles)|attitude control]] and [[dynamic positioning]].

'''Mathematical psychology''' is an approach to [[psychology|psychological]] research that is based on [[mathematical modeling]] of perceptual, thought, cognitive and motor processes, and on the establishment of law-like rules that relate quantifiable stimulus characteristics with quantifiable behavior. The mathematical approach is used with the goal of deriving hypotheses that are more exact and thus yield stricter empirical validations. Quantifiable behavior is in practice often constituted by task performance.

As quantification of behavior is fundamental in this endeavor, the [[measurement|theory of measurement]] is a central topic in mathematical psychology.
Mathematical psychology is therefore closely related to [[psychometrics]]. However, where psychometrics is concerned with individual differences (or population structure) in mostly static variables, mathematical psychology focuses on process models of perceptual, cognitive and motor processes as inferred from the 'average individual'. Furthermore, where psychometrics investigates the stochastic dependence structure between variables as observed in the population, mathematical psychology almost exclusively focuses on the modeling of data obtained from experimental paradigms and is therefore even more closely related to [[experimental psychology]]/[[cognitive psychology]]/[[psychonomics]]. &lt;!--The models used are mostly probabilistic but there are also discrete ones.--&gt; Like [[computational neuroscience]] and [[econometrics]], mathematical psychology theory often uses statistical optimality as a guiding principle, assuming that the human brain has evolved to solve problems in an optimized way. Central themes from cognitive psychology; limited vs. unlimited processing capacity, serial vs. parallel processing, etc., and their implications, are central in rigorous analysis in mathematical psychology. &lt;!--There are many subfields including [[measurement|theory of measurement]].--&gt;

Mathematical psychologists are active in many fields of psychology, especially in [[psychophysics]], [[Sensation and perception psychology|sensation]] and [[perception]], [[problem solving]], [[decision theory|decision-making]], [[learning]], [[memory]], and [[psycholinguistics|language]], collectively known as [[cognitive psychology]], and the [[Society for Quantitative Analysis of Behavior|quantitative analysis of behavior]] but also, e.g., in [[clinical psychology]], [[social psychology]], and [[music psychology|psychology of music]].
&lt;!--Some mathematical models include but are not limited to the [[matching law]], [[detection_theory|signal detection theory]], [[game theory]], [[behavioral economics]]]], etc.--&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Ernst Heinrich Weber.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Ernst Heinrich Weber]].]]
[[Image:Gustav Fechner.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Gustav Fechner]].]]

Mathematical modeling has a long history in psychology starting in the 19th century with [[Ernst Heinrich Weber|Ernst Weber]] (1795–1878) and [[Gustav Fechner]] (1801–1887) being among the first to apply successful mathematical technique of [[functional equations]] from physics to psychological processes. They thereby established the fields of [[experimental psychology]] in general, and that of [[psychophysics]] in particular.

Researchers in [[astronomy]] in the 19th century were mapping distances between stars by denoting the exact time of a star's passing of a cross-hair on a telescope. For lack of the automatic registration instruments of the modern era, these time measurements relied entirely on human response speed. It had been noted that there were small systematic differences in the times measured by different astronomers, and these were first systematically studied by German astronomer [[Friedrich Bessel]] (1782–1846). Bessel constructed ''personal equations'' from measurements of basic response speed that would cancel out individual differences from the astronomical calculations. Independently, physicist [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] measured reaction times to determine nerve conduction speed.

These two lines of work came together in the research of Dutch physiologist [[Franciscus Donders|F. C. Donders]] and his student [[Johan Jacob de Jaager|J. J. de Jaager]], who recognized the potential of reaction times for more or less objectively quantifying the amount of time elementary mental operations required. Donders envisioned the employment of his ''[[mental chronometry]]'' to scientifically infer the elements of complex cognitive activity by measurement of ''simple reaction time''&lt;ref name="Leahey1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Leahey |first=T. H. |year=1987 |title=A History of Psychology |location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=Second |isbn=0-13-391764-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The following is a set of loose points not well integrated with the main text. It interrupts the flow of the article and doesn't seem to serve a point -----------
In the United States, [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] conducted experiments on reaction times, weight discrimination, and color perception. In the famous experiment on weight discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;
* {{cite article| author=[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and [[Joseph Jastrow]]|year=1885|title=On Small Differences in Sensation|url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Peirce/small-diffs.htm|| journal=Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=3|pages=73–83}} http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Peirce/small-diffs.htm
* {{cite article|author=[[Ian Hacking]]| title=Telepathy: Origins of Randomization in Experimental Design|journal=[[Isis (journal)|Isis]] (A Special Issue on Artifact and Experiment)|volume=79|number=3| month=September|year=1988 |pages=427–451}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
Peirce (with the assistance of [[Robert Jastrow]]) introduced important statistical methods, including
*[[Randomized controlled trial|the randomized assignment of treatments to subjects]], [[blind experiment]]s, and [[logistic regression]].

Peirce's experiment on reaction times invented a [[repeated measures design]] and used [[smoothing]]. Peirce's psycho-physical experiments are discussed in the statistical histories by [[Stephen Stigler#Books|Stephen Stigler]].
----------------------------------------------&gt;
The first psychological laboratory was established in Germany by [[Wilhelm Wundt]], who amply used Donders' ideas. However, findings that came from the laboratory were hard to replicate and this was soon attributed to the method of [[introspection]] that Wundt introduced. Some of the problems resulted from individual differences in response speed found by astronomers. Although Wundt did not seem to take interest in these individual variations and kept his focus on the study of the ''general human mind'', Wundt's U.S. student [[James McKeen Cattell]] was fascinated by these differences and started to work on them during his stay in England.

The failure of Wundt's method of introspection led to the rise of different schools of thought. Wundt's laboratory was directed towards conscious human experience, in line with the work of Fechner and Weber on the intensity of stimuli. In the United Kingdom, under the influence of the anthropometric developments led by [[Francis Galton]], interest focussed on individual differences between humans on psychological variables, in line with the work of Bessel. Cattell soon adopted the methods of Galton and helped laying the foundation of [[psychometrics]].

===20th century===

In the United States, [[behaviorism]] arose in opposition to [[introspectionism]] and associated reaction-time research, and turned the focus of psychological research entirely to learning theory.&lt;ref name="Leahey1987"/&gt; In Europe introspection survived in [[Gestalt psychology]]. Behaviorism dominated American psychology until the end of the [[Second World War]], and largely refrained from inference on mental processes. Formal theories were mostly absent (except for [[visual perception|vision]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]]).

During the war, developments in [[engineering]], [[mathematical logic]] and [[computability theory]], [[computer science]] and [[mathematics]], and the military need to understand [[human factors|human performance and limitations]], brought together experimental psychologists, mathematicians, engineers, physicists, and economists. Out of this mix of different disciplines mathematical psychology arose. Especially the developments in [[signal processing]], [[information theory]], [[linear systems]] and [[filter theory]], [[game theory]], [[stochastic processes]] and [[mathematical logic]] gained a large influence on psychological thinking.&lt;ref name="Leahey1987"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelder2002" /&gt;

Two seminal papers on learning theory in ''[[Psychological Review]]'' helped to establish the field in a world that was still dominated by behaviorists: A paper by Bush and Mosteller instigated the linear operator approach to learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The 1950s saw a surge in mathematical theories of psychological processes, including [[Luce's choice axiom|Luce's theory of choice]], Tanner and Swets' introduction of [[signal detection theory]] for human stimulus detection, and Miller's approach to information processing.&lt;ref name="Batchelder2002"&gt;{{cite book |last=Batchelder |first=W. H. |year=2002 |chapter=Mathematical Psychology |editor-first=A. E. |editor-last=Kazdin |title=Encyclopedia of Psychology |location=Washington/NY |publisher=APA/Oxford University Press |isbn=1-55798-654-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 1950s, the number of mathematical psychologists had increased from a handful by more than a tenfold, not counting psychometricians. Most of these were concentrated at the Indiana University, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Stanford.&lt;ref name="Batchelder2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Estes2002"&gt;[http://www.mathpsych.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19&amp;Itemid=27 Estes, W. K. (2002). History of the Society]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these were regularly invited by the U.S. Social Science Research Counsel to teach in summer workshops in mathematics for social scientists at Stanford University, promoting collaboration.

To better define the field of mathematical psychology, the mathematical models of the 1950s were brought together in sequence of volumes edited by Luce, Bush, and Galanter: Two readings&lt;ref&gt;Luce, R. D., Bush, R. R. &amp; Galanter, E. (Eds.) (1963). ''Readings in mathematical psychology. Volumes I &amp; II.'' New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; and three handbooks.&lt;ref&gt;Luce, R. D., Bush, R. R. &amp; Galanter, E. (Eds.) (1963). Handbook of mathematical psychology. Volumes I-III''. New York: Wiley. [https://www.archive.org/download/handbookofmathem017893mbp/handbookofmathem017893mbp.pdf  Volume II from Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; This series of volumes turned out to be helpful in the development of the field. In the summer of 1963 the need was felt for a journal for theoretical and mathematical studies in all areas in psychology, excluding work that was mainly factor analytical. An initiative led by [[Richard C. Atkinson|R. C. Atkinson]], [[R. R. Bush]], [[W. K. Estes]], [[R. Duncan Luce|R. D. Luce]], and [[P. Suppes]] resulted in the appearance of the first issue of the [[Journal of Mathematical Psychology]] in January, 1964.&lt;ref name="Estes2002"/&gt;

Under the influence of developments in computer science, logic, and language theory, in the 1960s modeling gravitated towards computational mechanisms and devices. Examples of the latter constitute so called [[cognitive architectures]] (e.g., [[Production system (computer science)|production rule system]]s, [[ACT-R]]) as well as [[connectionist]] systems or [[neural networks]].

Important mathematical expressions for relations between physical characteristics of stimuli and subjective perception are [[Weber-Fechner law|Weber's law]] (which is now sometimes called Weber-Fechner Law), [[Ekman's Law]], [[Stevens' Power Law]], Thurstone's [[Law of Comparative Judgment]], the [[Signal detection theory|Theory of Signal Detection]] (borrowed from radar engineering), the [[Matching Law]], and [[Rescorla-Wagner model|Rescorla-Wagner rule]] for classical conditioning. While the first three laws are all [[deterministic]] in nature, later established relations are more fundamentally [[stochastic]]. This has been a general theme in the evolution in mathematical modeling of psychological processes: from deterministic relations as found in classical physics to inherently stochastic models.

[[File:MedicalExaminerVan.jpg|right|thumb|Medical examiner van]]

A '''medical examiner''' is a person trained in medicine or a medical organization that investigates deaths and injuries that occur under unusual or suspicious circumstances, to perform [[post-mortem]] examinations, and in some jurisdictions to initiate [[inquest]]s.&lt;ref name=CvM&gt;{{cite web|title=Coroner vs. medical examiner|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/visibleproofs/galleries/cases/examiner.html|website=Visible Proofs|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical examiners, [[coroner]]s and [[forensic pathologist]]s are often thought to be the same, but they are different professions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org/medical-examiner/|title=Forensic Medical Examiner Jobs in Forensic Criminal Investigations|website=www.crimesceneinvestigatoredu.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2018}} Coroners have a completely different role as well as having differing responsibilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In some parts of the United States, unlike a medical examiner or forensic pathologist, coroners are elected officials and may not require the extensive medical training that the former must go through.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Job roles==
A medical examiner's duties may vary depending on location. The medical examiners’ job is usually extensive and has a lot that goes into it. Typically, a medical examiner's duties may include:

* investigating human organs like the stomach, liver, brain,
* determining cause of death,
* examining the condition of the body&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* studying tissue, organs, cells, and bodily fluids&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* issuing [[death certificates]],
* maintaining [[Death Records|death records]],
* responding to deaths in mass disasters,
* working closely with [[law enforcement]]&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://explorehealthcareers.org/career/forensic-science/forensic-pathologist/|title=Forensic Pathologist {{!}} explorehealthcareers.org|website=explorehealthcareers.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* identifying unknown dead, or
* performing other functions depending on local law.

In some [[jurisdictions]],  a [[coroner]] performs these and other duties. It’s not uncommon for a medical examiner to visit [[crime scene]]s or to testify in [[court]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This takes a certain amount of confidence in which the medical examiner has to rely on their expertise to make a true [[testimony]] and accurately testify the facts of their findings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Medical examiners specialize in [[Forensic science|forensic]] knowledge and rely on this during their work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In addition to studying [[cadaver]]s, they are also trained in [[toxicology]], DNA technology and [[forensic serology]] (blood analysis).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pulling from each area of knowledge, a medical examiner can accurately determine a cause of death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This information can help law enforcement crack a case and is crucial to their ability to track criminals in the event of a [[homicide]] or other related events.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Within the United States, there is a mixture of coroner and medical examiner systems, and in some states, [[Dual systems model|dual systems]].  The requirements to hold office vary widely between jurisdictions.

==Qualifications==

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|formal medical training]] is required for medical examiners. Many employers also request training in [[pathology]] while others do not. In the UK, a medical examiner is always a medically trained professional, whereas a [[Coroner#England and Wales|coroner]] is a [[judicial officer]].

Pilot studies in Sheffield and seven other areas, which involved medical examiners looking at more than 27,000 deaths since 2008, found 25% of hospital death certificates were inaccurate and 20% of causes of death were wrong. [[Suzy Lishman]], president of the [[Royal College of Pathologists]], said it was crucial there was "independent scrutiny of causes of death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Medical examiners help expose patient safety risks|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/exclusive-medical-examiners-help-expose-patient-safety-risks/5081968.article#.VP9HiPzkdc4|accessdate=10 March 2015|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Qualifications for medical examiners in the US vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  In Wisconsin, for example, some counties do not require individuals to have any special educational or medical training to hold this office.&lt;ref&gt;Coroners and Medical Examiners: A Comparison of Options Offered by Both Systems in Wisconsin Jenifer Keach, Rock (WI) County Coroner, April 6, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In most jurisdictions, a medical examiner is required to have a [[medical degree]], although in many this need not be in pathology. Other jurisdictions have stricter requirements, including additional education in [[pathology]], law, and [[forensic pathology]]. Medical examiners are typically appointed officers.&lt;ref&gt;National Academy of Sciences, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward, (2009), pp 241–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
In the United States, the road to becoming a medical examiner is a long and hard one. They require a lot of extensive training in order to become experts in their field.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After high school, the additional schooling may take 11–18 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  They must attend a [[college]] or [[university]] to receive a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor’s degree]] in the sciences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Biology]] is usually the most common.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://learn.org/articles/Medical_Examiner_How_to_Become_a_Medical_Examiner_in_5_Steps.html|title=How to Become a Medical Examiner in 5 Steps|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On average, it takes four years to complete a bachelor’s degree.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A medical degree (Doctor of Medicine, MD) is required to become a medical examiner.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.forensicsciencecareers.net/medical-examiner.html|title=Medical Examiner - Forensic Science Careers|work=Forensic Science Careers|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; To prepare for medical school, the [[Medical College Admission Test|MCAT]] (Medical College Admissions Test) must be taken and passed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Medical school]] is another four years with the first two dedicated to academics and the rest of the two used to gain [[clinic]]al experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Additional training is required after medical school. The first step is to complete pathological forensic training.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This usually consists of anatomic and clinical pathology training which takes anywhere from four to five years to complete.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After this, an anatomic pathology [[residency (medicine)|residency]] and/or a [[fellowship (medicine)|fellowship]] in forensic pathology should be completed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Before practicing, they must also become certified through the [[American Board of Pathology]];&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; this certificate is good for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://learningpath.org/articles/Becoming_a_Medical_Examiner_Salary_Info_Job_Description.html|title=Becoming a Medical Examiner: Salary Info &amp; Job Description|website=learningpath.org|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Job outlook ==
The general job outlook for medical examiners in the United States is considered to be excellent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Salary varies greatly by state and location, but it is estimated to average between $105,000 and $500,000 a year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Mexican art''' consists of various [[visual arts]] that developed over the geographical area now known as Mexico. The development of these arts roughly follows the [[history of Mexico]], divided into the prehispanic [[Mesoamerica]]n era, the colonial period, with the period after [[Mexican War of Independence]] further subdivided. Mexican art is usually filled most of the time with intricate patterns.&lt;ref name="jflam"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexican Art Over Three Millennia |first=Jack |last=ver Flam |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location=New York |date=October 9, 1990 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesoamerican art is that produced in an area that encompasses much of what is now central and southern Mexico, before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] for a period of about 3,000 years from 1500 BCE to 1500 CE. During this time, all influences on art production were indigenous, with art heavily tied to religion and the ruling class. There was little to no real distinction among art, architecture, and writing. The Spanish conquest led to 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, and art production remained tied to religion—most art was associated with the construction and decoration of churches, but secular art expanded in the eighteenth century, particularly [[casta]] paintings, portraiture, and history painting. Almost all art produced was in the European tradition, with late colonial-era artists trained at the [[Academy of San Carlos]], but indigenous elements remained, beginning a continuous balancing act between European and indigenous traditions.&lt;ref name="paz"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.301.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Independence, art remained heavily European in style, but indigenous themes appeared in major works as liberal Mexico sought to distinguish itself from its Spanish colonial past. This preference for indigenous elements continued into the first half of the 20th century, with the [[Mexican muralism|Social Realism or Mexican muralist movement]] led by artists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[Fernando Leal (artist)|Fernando Leal]], who were commissioned by the post-[[Mexican Revolution]] government to create a visual narrative of Mexican history and culture.

The strength of this artistic movement was such that it affected newly invented technologies, such as still photography and cinema, and strongly promoted popular arts and crafts as part of Mexico's identity. Since the 1950s, Mexican art has broken away from the muralist style and has been more globalized, integrating elements from Asia, with Mexican artists and filmmakers having an effect on the global stage.

==Pre-Columbian art==
[[File:Cavepaintings-loltun.jpg|thumb|Painting cave in [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]]]
[[File:Bonampak-7269.JPG|thumb|300px|A Maya mural at [[Bonampak]], 8th century AD.]]

It is believed that the American continent's oldest rock art, 7500 years old, is found in a cave on the peninsula of Baja California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/2002/12/12/ciencia/1292233.html Descubierta en una cueva de México la pintura rupestre más antigua de América / EL MUNDO&lt;!-- Título generado por un bot --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213061450/http://www.elmundo.es/2002/12/12/ciencia/1292233.html |date=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Hispanic art of Mexico belongs to a cultural region known as [[Mesoamerica]], which roughly corresponds to central Mexico on into [[Central America]],&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing three thousand years from 1500 BCE to 1500 CE generally divided into three eras: Pre Classic, Classic and Post Classic.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dominant Mesoamerican culture was that of the [[Olmec]]s, which peaked around 1200 BCE. The Olmecs originated much of what is associated with Mesoamerica, such as [[Mesoamerican writing systems|hieroglyphic writing]], [[Mesoamerican calendars|calendar]], first advances in astronomy, monumental sculpture ([[Olmec colossal heads|Olmec heads]]) and [[jade]] work.&lt;ref name="pazp38"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were a forerunner of later cultures such as [[Teotihuacan]], north of Mexico City, the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] in Oaxaca and the [[Mayan peoples|Mayas]] in southern Mexico, [[Belize]] and [[Guatemala]]. While empires rose and fell, the basic cultural underpinnings of the Mesoamerica stayed the same until the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]].&lt;ref name="pazp38"/&gt; These included cities centered on plazas, temples usually built on pyramid bases, [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s and a mostly common cosmology.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p4" /&gt;

While art forms such as cave paintings and rock etchings date from earlier, the known history of Mexican art begins with Mesoamerican art created by sedentary cultures that built cities, and often, dominions.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pazp38"/&gt; While the art of Mesoamerica is more varied and extends over more time than anywhere else in the Americas, artistic styles show a number of similarities.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p9"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike modern Western art, almost all Mesoamerican art was created to serve religious or political needs, rather than art for art's sake. It is strongly based on nature, the surrounding political reality and the gods.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p12" /&gt; [[Octavio Paz]] states that "Mesoamerican art is a logic of forms, lines, and volumes that is as the same time a cosmology." He goes on to state that this focus on space and time is highly distinct from European naturalism based on the representation of the human body. Even simple designs such as [[fretwork|stepped frets]] on buildings fall into this representation of space and time, life and the gods.&lt;ref name="pazp41"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tlatilco culture figurines.jpg|thumb|Female figurines from the [[Tlatilco culture]], 1250 to 800 BCE.]]
Art was expressed on a variety of mediums such as ceramics, [[amate]] paper and architecture.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p9" /&gt; Most of what is known of Mesoamerican art comes from works that cover stone buildings and pottery, mostly paintings and reliefs.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt; Ceramics date from the early the Mesoamerican period. They probably began as cooking and storage vessels but then were adapted to ritual and decorative uses. Ceramics were decorated by shaping, scratching, painting and different firing methods.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p12"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known purely artistic production were small ceramic figures that appeared in [[Tehuacán, Puebla|Tehuacán]] area around 1,500 BCE and spread to [[Veracruz]], the [[Valley of Mexico]], [[Guerrero]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Chiapas]] and the Pacific coast of Guatemala.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt; The earliest of these are mostly female figures, probably associated with fertility rites because of their often oversized hips and thighs, as well as a number with babies in arms or nursing. When male figures appear they are most often soldiers.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p56"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these ceramic figures, which would later include animals and other forms, remained an important art form for 2000 years. In the early Olmec period most were small but large-scale ceramic sculptures were produced as large as 55&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p2"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p6"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the middle pre-Classic, ceramic sculpture declined in the center of Mexico except in the [[Chupícuaro (archaeological site)|Chupícuaro]] region. In the Mayan areas, the art disappears in the late pre-Classic, to reappear in the Classic, mostly in the form of whistles and other musical instruments. In a few areas, such as parts of Veracruz, the creation of ceramic figures continued uninterrupted until the Spanish conquest, but as a handcraft, not a formal art.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p67"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Messico, maya, piatto da calakmul, 600-800 ca..JPG|thumb|Painted ceramic plate from [[Calakmul]], 600 to 800 AD.]]
Mesoamerican painting is found in various expressions—from murals, to the creation of [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]] and the painting of ceramic objects. Evidence of painting goes back at least to 1800&amp;nbsp;BCE and continues uninterrupted in one form or another until the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p2"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it may have occurred earlier, the earliest known cases of artistic painting of monumental buildings occur in the early Classic period with the Mayas at [[Uaxactun]] and [[Tikal]], and in [[Teotihuacan]] with walls painted in various colors.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;

Paints were made from animal, vegetable and mineral pigments and bases.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Most paintings focus one or more human figures, which may be realistic or stylized, masculine, feminine or asexual. They may be naked or richly attired, but the social status of each figure is indicated in some way. Scenes often depict war, sacrifice, the roles of the gods or the acts of nobles. However, some common scenes with common people have been found as well.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p5"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Other subjects included gods, symbols and animals.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4" /&gt; Mesoamerican painting was bi-dimensional with no efforts to create the illusion of depth. However, movement is often represented.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-ceramic sculpture in Mesoamerica began with the modification of animal bones, with the oldest known piece being an animal skull from [[Tequixquiac]] that dates between 10,000 and 8,000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p56" /&gt; Most Mesoamerican sculpture is of stone; while relief work on buildings is the most dominant, freestanding sculpture was done as well. Freestanding three-dimensional stone sculpture began with the Olmecs, with the most famous example being the [[Olmec#Colossal heads|giant Olmec stone heads]]. This disappeared for the rest of the Mesoamerican period in favor of relief work until the late post-Classic with the [[Aztec]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CoyolxauhquiDisk cropped.JPG|thumb|A disk depicting the goddess [[Coyolxauhqui]], 14th to 16th century, at the [[Templo Mayor]] museum.]]
The majority of stonework during the Mesoamerican period is associated with monumental architecture that, along with mural painting, was considered an integral part of architecture rather than separate.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p15"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Monumental architecture began with the Olmecs in southern [[Veracruz]] and the coastal area of [[Tabasco]] in places such as San Lorenzo; large temples on pyramid bases can still be seen in sites such as Montenegro, [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]] and [[La Venta]]. This practice spread to the [[Oaxaca]] area and the [[Valley of Mexico]], appearing in cities such as [[Monte Albán]], [[Cuicuilco]] and [[Teotihuacan]].&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p18"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

These cities had a nucleus of one or more plazas, with temples, palaces and [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s. Alignment of these structures was based on the cardinal directions and astronomy for ceremonial purposes, such as focusing the sun's rays during the spring equinox on a sculpted or painted image. This was generally tied to calendar systems.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p2023"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.20-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Relief sculpture and/or painting were created as the structures were built. By the latter pre-Classic, almost all monumental structures in Mesoamerica had extensive relief work. Some of the best examples of this are Monte Albán, Teotihuacan and [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p5"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Hispanic reliefs are general lineal in design and low, medium and high reliefs can be found. While this technique is often favored for narrative scenes elsewhere in the world, Mesoamerican reliefs tend to focus on a single figure. The only time reliefs are used in the narrative sense is when several relief steles are placed together. The best relief work is from the Mayas, especially from [[Yaxchilan]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing and art were not distinct as they have been for European cultures. Writing was considered art and art was often covering in writing.&lt;ref name="pazp41" /&gt; The reason for this is that both sought to record history and the culture's interpretation of reality.(salvatvolp14) Manuscripts were written on paper or other book-like materials then bundled into [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]].&lt;ref name="eboone"&gt;Boone 2000, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The art of reading and writing was strictly designated to the highest priest classes, as this ability was a source of their power over society.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7" /&gt;

The [[Mesoamerican writing systems|pictograms or glyphs of this writing system]] were more formal and rigid than images found on murals and other art forms as they were considered mostly symbolic, representing formulas related to astronomical events, genealogy and historic events.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7" /&gt; Most surviving pre-Hispanic codices come from the late Mesoamerican period and early colonial period, as more of these escaped destruction over history. For this reason, more is known about the Aztec Empire than the Mayan cultures.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eboone" /&gt; Important [[Aztec codices]] include the [[Borgia Group]] of mainly religious works, some of which probably pre-date the conquest, the [[Codex Borbonicus]], [[Codex Mendoza]], and the late [[Florentine Codex]], which is in a European style but executed by Mexican artists, probably drawing on earlier material that is now lost.

==Colonial era, 1521–1821==

===The early colonial era and indigenous artists and influences===
{{See also|Aztec codices}}
[[File:AtriumCrossAcolman1.JPG|thumb|right|An atrium cross in [[Acolman]]. During the early period of evangelization, an enclosed open chapels for large congregations of neophytes saw the creation and placement of decorated, anthropomorphized stone crosses with Jesus at their center.]]
Since the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Mexican art has been an ongoing and complex interaction between the traditions of Europe and native perspectives.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;

'''Church construction'''  After the conquest, Spaniards' first efforts were directed at evangelization and the related task of building churches, which needed indigenous labor for basic construction, but they Nahuas elaborated stonework exteriors and decorated church interiors. Indigenous craftsmen were taught European motifs, designs and techniques, but very early work, called ''tequitqui'' ([[Nahuatl]] for “vassal”), includes elements such as flattened faces and high-stiff relief.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p34"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mexorg"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicanarchitecture.org/glossary/index.php?detail=121 |author=Charlote Ekland |title= Mexican Colonial Architecture |publisher=Mexican Architecture |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish friars directing construction were not trained architects or engineers. They relied on indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches and other Christian structures, often in the same places as temples and shrines of the traditional religion. "Although some Indians complained about the burden such labor represented, most communities considered a large and impressive church to be a reflection of their town's importance and took justifiable pride in creating a sacred place for divine worship."&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''. Prentice Hall 2003, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that so many colonial-era churches have survived centuries it testament to their general good construction.

The first monasteries built in and around Mexico City, such as the [[Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl|monasteries on the slopes of Popocatepetl]], had [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Plateresque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] elements, or some combination. They were relatively undecorated, with building efforts going more towards high walls and fortress features to ward off attacks.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p17"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of more elaborate churches with large quantities of religious artwork would define much of the artistic output of the colonial period. Most of the production was related to the teaching and reinforcement of Church doctrine, just as in Europe. Religious art set the rationale for Spanish domination over the indigenous. Today, colonial-era structures and other works exist all over the country, with a concentration in the central highlands around [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p3"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huanitzin.jpg|thumb|300px|The ''[[Mass of St. Gregory]]'', feathers on wood panel, the oldest dated feather work with a Christian subject. Made by or for [[Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin|Diego Huanutzin]], nephew and son-in-law of [[Moctezuma II]] to present to [[Pope Paul III]], dated 1539]]
[[File:The Florentine Codex- Aztec Feather Painters VI.tiff|thumb|left|Feather work artists as depicted in the [[Florentine Codex]] (ca. 1576).]]
[[Mexican feather work|'''Feather work''']] was a highly valued skill of prehispanic central Mexico that continued into the early colonial era.  Spaniards were fascinated by this form of art, and indigenous feather workers (''amanteca'') produced religious images in this medium, mainly small "paintings", as well as religious vestments.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schrefler, "Visual Arts: Sixteenth Century" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1557.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Castello Yturbide, ''The Art of Featherwork in Mexico'', Mexico: Fomento Cultural Banamex 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indigenous writings'''  Indians continued production of written manuscripts in the early colonial era, especially [[Aztec codices|codices in the Nahua area]] of central Mexico.  An important early manuscript that was commissioned for the Spanish crown was [[Codex Mendoza]], named after the first viceroy of Mexico, Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]], which shows the tribute delivered to the Aztec ruler from individual towns as well as descriptions of proper comportment for the common people. A far more elaborate project utilizing indigenous scribes illustration is the project resulting in the [[Florentine Codex]] directed by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]].  Other indigenous manuscripts in the colonial era include the [[Huexotzinco Codex]] and Codex Osuna.

An important type of manuscript from the early period were pictorial and textual histories of the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs from the indigenous viewpoint.  The early [[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]] illustrated the contributions the Spaniards' Tlaxcalan allies made to the defeat of the Aztec empire, as well the [[Hernán Cortés]] and his cultural translator Doña Marina ([[Malinche]]).

'''Painting''' Most Nahua artists producing this visual art are anonymous.  An exception is the work of Juan Gerson, who ca. 1560 decorated the vault of the Franciscan church in the Nahua town of Tecamachalco,(Puebla state), with individual scenes from the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Schrefler, "Visual Arts", p.1556.&lt;/ref&gt;

While colonial art remained almost completely European in style, with muted colors and no indication of movement—the addition of native elements, which began with the ''tequitqui,'' continued. They were never the center of the works, but decorative motifs and filler, such as native foliage, pineapples, corn, and [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]].&lt;ref name="jcummings"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1311-diego-frida-and-the-mexican-school |title= Diego, Frida And The Mexican School |first=Joe |last=Cummings |date= January 1, 1999 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this can be seen on portals as well as large frescoes that often decorated the interior of churches and the walls of monastery areas closed to the public.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253322 |title=Colonial Art |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest of Mexico's colonial artists were Spanish-born who came to Mexico in the middle of their careers. This included mendicant friars, such as Fray Alonso López de Herrera. Later, most artists were born in Mexico, but trained in European techniques, often from imported engravings. This dependence on imported copies meant that Mexican works preserved styles after they had gone out of fashion in Europe.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt; In the colonial period, artists worked in guilds, not independently. Each guild had its own rules, precepts, and mandates in technique—which did not encourage innovation.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p10"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexican Baroque===
{{See also|Architecture of Mexico}}
[[File:Eternal father painting guadalupe.jpg|right|thumb|18th-century painting of [[God the Father]] fashioning the image of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]]]]
Baroque painting became firmly established in Mexico by the middle of the 17th century with the work of Spaniard Sebastián López de Arteaga. His painting is exemplified by the canvas called ''Doubting Thomas'' from 1643. In this work, the [[Apostle Thomas]] is shown inserting his finger in the wound in Christ's side to emphasize Christ's suffering. The caption below reads "the Word made flesh" and is an example of Baroque's didactic purpose.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

One difference between painters in Mexico and their European counterparts is that they preferred realistic directness and clarity over fantastic colors, elongated proportions and extreme spatial relationships. The goal was to create a realistic scene in which the viewer could imagine himself a part of. This was a style created by [[Caravaggio]] in Italy, which became popular with artists in [[Seville]], from which many migrants came to New Spain came.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Similarly, Baroque free standing sculptures feature life-size scales, realistic skin tones and the simulation of gold-threaded garments through a technique called ''estofado'', the application of paint over gold leaf.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

The most important later influence to Mexican and other painters in Latin America was the work of Flemish artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]], known through copies made from engravings and [[mezzotint]] techniques. His paintings were copied and reworked and became the standard for both religious and secular art.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Later Baroque paintings moved from the confines of altarpieces to colossal freestanding canvases on church interiors. One of the best known Mexican painters of this kind of work was [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]]. His work can be seen in the [[sacristy]] of the Mexico City Cathedral, which was done between 1684 and 1686. These canvases were glued directly onto the walls with arched frames to stabilize them, and placed just under the vaults of the ceiling. Even the fresco work of the 16th century was not usually this large.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Another one of Villalpando's works is the cupola of the [[Puebla Cathedral]] in 1688. He used Rubens’ brush techniques and the shape of the structure to create a composition of clouds with angels and saints, from which a dove descends to represent the Holy Spirit. The light from the cupola's windows is meant to symbolize God's grace.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; [[Juan Rodríguez Juárez]] (1675–1728) and mulatto artist [[Juan Correa]] (1646–1716) were also prominent painters of the baroque era. Correa's most famous student, [[José de Ibarra]] (1685–1756) was also mixed-race. One of Mexico's finest painters, [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]] (1695–1768), was possibly mixed race.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, "Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700–85" in ''Painting in Latin America, 1550–1820'', Luisa Elena Alcalá and Jonathan Brown, eds. New Haven: Yale University Press 2014, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church produced the most important works of the seventeenth century. Among the important painters were [[Baltasar de Echave Ibia]] and his son Baltasar Echave Rioja, also [[Luis Juárez (painter)|Luis Juárez]] and his son [[José Juárez]], [[Juan Correa]], [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]], Rodrigo de la Piedra, Antonio de Santander, Polo Bernardino, Juan de Villalobos, Juan Salguero and Juan de Herrera. Juan Correa, worked from 1671 to 1716 and reached great prestige and reputation for the quality of its design and scale of some of his works. Among the best known: 'Apocalypse in the Cathedral of Mexico', 'Conversion of St. Mary Magdalene', now in the 'Pinacoteca Virreinal' and 'Santa Catarina and Adam and Eve casting out of paradise', the latter located in the [[Museo Nacional del Virreinato|National Museum of Viceroyalty]] of [[Tepotzotlán]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1541-Arte-y-cultura-en-la-colonia Arte y cultura en la colonia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013144844/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1541-Arte-y-cultura-en-la-colonia |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial religious art was sponsored by Church authorities and private patrons. Sponsoring the rich ornamentation of churches was a way for the wealthy to gain prestige.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p3" /&gt; In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Mexico City was one of the wealthiest in the world, mostly due to mining and agriculture, and was able to support a large art scene.&lt;ref name="dwarren"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren |first=David B. |date=April 2002 |title=The Magazine Antiques |journal=Art Journal |volume=161 |issue=4 |pages=120–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassical and Secular Art===

While most commissioned art was for churches, secular works were commissioned as well. Portrait painting was known relatively early in the colonial period, mostly of viceroys and archbishops. Beginning in the late Baroque period, portrait painting of local nobility became a significant genre. Two notable painters of this type are brothers Nicolás and Juan Rodríguez Juárez. These works followed European models, with symbols of rank and titles either displayed unattached in the outer portions or worked into another element of the paintings such as curtains.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

Another type of secular colonial painting is called [[casta]] paintings referring to the depiction of racial hierarchy racially in eighteenth-century [[New Spain]]. Some were likely commissioned by Spanish functionaries as souvenirs of Mexico. A number of artists of the era created casta paintings, including [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], [[José de Ibarra]], [[Juan Patricio Morlete Ruiz]], [[Francisco Clapera]], and [[Luis de Mena]], but most casta paintings are unsigned. Ibarra, Morlete, and possibly Cabrera were of mixed race and born outside Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, "Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700-85" in ''Painting in Latin America, 1550–1820'', Luisa Elena Alcalá and Jonathan Brown. New Haven: Yale University Press 2014, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mena's only known casta painting links the Virgin of Guadalupe and the casta system, as well as depictions of fruits and vegetables and scenes of everyday life in mideighteenth-century Mexico. It is one of the most-reproduced examples of casta paintings, one of the small number that show the casta system on a single canvas rather than up to 16 separate paintings. It is unique in uniting the thoroughly secular genre of casta painting with a depiction of the Virgin of Guadalupe.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Cline, "Guadalupe and the Castas: The Power of a Singular Colonial Mexican Painting", ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'', Vol. 31, Issue 2, Summer 2015, pages 218–246.&lt;/ref&gt; Production of these paintings stopped after the [[Mexican War of Independence]], when legal racial categories were repudiated in independent Mexico. Until the run-up to the 500th anniversary of the Columbus's 1492 voyage, casta paintings were of little or no interest, even to art historians, but scholars began systematically studying them as a genre.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "Guadalupe and the Castas", p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;María Concepción García Sáiz, ''Las castas mexicanas: un g´enero pictórico americano''. Milan: Olivetti, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew. ''Casta Paintings: Images of Race in Eighteenth-Century Mexico''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico was a crossroads of trade in the colonial period, with goods from Asia and Europe mixing with those natively produced. This convergence is most evident in the decorative arts of New Spain.&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; It was popular among the upper classes to have a main public room, called a ''salon de estrado'', to be covered in rugs and cushions for women to recline in Moorish fashion. Stools and later chairs and settees were added for men. Folding screens were introduced from Japan, with Mexican-style ones produced called ''biombos'' The earliest of these Mexican made screens had oriental designs but later ones had European and Mexican themes. One example of this is a screen with the conquest of Mexico one side and an aerial view of Mexico City on the other at the [[Franz Mayer Museum]].&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt;

The Crown promoted the establishment in Mexico of the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style of art and architecture, which had become popular in Spain. This style was a reinterpretation of Greco-Roman references and its use was a way to reinforce European dominance in the Spain's colonies. One Neoclassical artist from the Academy at the end of the colonial period was [[Manuel Tolsá]]. He first taught sculpture at the [[Academy of San Carlos]] and then became its second director. Tolsá designed a number of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical buildings]] in Mexico but his best known work is an equestrian status of King Charles IV in bronze cast in 1803 and originally placed in the [[Zócalo]]. As of 2011 it can be seen at the [[Museo Nacional de Arte]].&lt;ref name="statesponsored" /&gt;

Along with the construction of temples and houses artistic religious themes proliferated. In New Spain, as in the rest of the [[New World]], since the seventeenth century, particularly during the eighteenth century, the portrait became an important part of the artistic repertoire. In a society characterized by a deep religious feeling which was imbued, it was expected that many portraits reflected the moral virtues and piety of the model.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retratos.org/pdfs/TRG_121504b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305145806/http://www.retratos.org/pdfs/TRG_121504b.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent painters of this period are: [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]], [[Juan Correa (1646–1716)|Juan Correa]], [[José de Ibarra]], Joseph Mora, Nicolas Rodriguez Juarez, Francisco Martinez, [[Miguel Cabrera]], Andrés López and Nicolás Enríquez. Sebastian Zalcedo painted ca. 1780 a beautiful allegory of the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe (Mexico)|Virgin of Guadalupe]] in oil on copper foil. In this century Josep Antonio de Ayala was a prominent artist, who is known for painting ''[[La familia del Valle a los pies de la Virgen de Loreto (Josep Antonio de Ayala)|The family of the Valley at the foot of Our Lady of Loreto]]'' c. 1769. This devotional painting was commissioned to be done for the children of the del Valle family in memory of his parents and is characteristic of the painting of this century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seis Siglos de Arte, Cien Grandes Maestros de Romero|editor-last=de Romero|editor-first=Soumaya Slim|editor-first2=Minerva Mogollan|editor-last2=Garcia|editor-first3=Eva Maria|editor-last3=Ayala Canseco|publisher=Fundacion Carso / Museo Soumaya|year=2006|isbn=9789687794303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A description of colonial art says: ''"In the "Sponsorship of [[Saint Joseph]] on the Caroline College", [[Saint Joseph]] is seen as a major figure of the work, who carries on his left side the child [[Jesus]]. Two archangels flank him and maintain its long purple robe. At the top two little angels are observed with intent to crown the holy". "For centuries, the work was attributed to [[Manuel Caro]], but the meticulous restoration work allowed to find the signature of the original author. Miguel Cabrera"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comunicacion.buap.mx/bol_mar08/boletin-d-13mar.html |title=Puebla, Pue. México, Jueves 13 de Marzo de 2008 |website=Comunicacion.buap.mx |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, artists increasingly included the Latin phrase ''[[pinxit]] Mexici'' (painted in Mexico) on works bound for the European market as a sign of pride in their artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Painted in Mexico, 1700–1790: Pinxit Mexici |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/pinxit-mexici |website=www.metmuseum.org |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |quote=This expression eloquently encapsulates the painters' pride in their own tradition and their connection to larger, transatlantic trends.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Academy of San Carlos===
[[File:Rafael Ximeno y Planes - Portrait of Manuel Tolsá - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Manuel Tolsá]], director of the [[Academy of San Carlos]] by [[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]], director of painting at the Academy]]
The last colonial era art institution established was the [[Academy of San Carlos]] in 1783.&lt;ref name="statesponsored"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253329 |title=State sponsored art |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the depiction of saints consumed most artistic efforts, they were not without political effects. The most important of these was the rise of the cult of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] as an American rather than European saint, representative of a distinct identity.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p13"&gt;Rosas, 1982, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 18th century, Spain's colonies were becoming culturally independent from Spain, including its arts. The Academy was established by the [[Spanish Crown]] to regain control of artistic expression and the messages it disseminated. This school was staffed by Spanish artists in each of the major disciplines, with the first director being Antonio Gil.&lt;ref name="statesponsored" /&gt; The school became home to a number of plaster casts of classic statues from the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|San Fernando Fine Arts Academy]] in Spain, brought there for teaching purposes. These casts are on display in the Academy's central patio.&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last=Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |author2=Magdelena Galindo |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |pages=70–72 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy of San Carlos survived into post-independence Mexico.

==Independence to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, 1821–1911==

===Early Post-independence era the Mid Nineteenth Century===

Artists of the independence era in Mexico (1810–21) produced works showing the insurgency's heroes. A portrait of secular cleric [[José María Morelos]] in his military uniform was painted by an unknown artist. The portrait is typical of those from the late eighteenth century, with framing elements, a formal caption, and new elements being iconography of the emerging Mexican nationalism, including the eagle atop the nopal cactus, which became the central image for the Mexican flag.&lt;ref&gt;James Oles, ''Mexican Art and Architecture''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson 2013, pp. 151-152.&lt;/ref&gt; Morelos was the subject of a commissioned statue, with [[Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque]], who trained at the Academy of San Carlos and remained an important sculptor through the era of era independence.&lt;ref&gt;James Oles, ''Art and Architecture in Mexico''. London: Thames and Hudson 2013, pp. 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of San Carlos remained the center of academic painting and the most prestigious art institution in Mexico until the [[Mexican War of Independence]], during which it was closed.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/ |title= Academia de San Carlos |language= Spanish |accessdate= November 30, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090409140215/http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/ |archivedate= April 9, 2009 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its association with the Spanish Crown and European painting tradition, the Academy was reopened by the new government after Mexico gained full independence in 1821. Its former Spanish faculty and students either died during the war or returned to Spain, but when it reopened it attracted the best art students of the country, and continued to emphasize classical European traditions until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="neoclassbrit"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253332 |title=Neoclassicism |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academy was renamed to the National Academy of San Carlos. The new government continued to favor Neoclassical as it considered the Baroque a symbol of colonialism. The Neoclassical style continued in favor through the reign of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] although President [[Benito Juárez]] supported it only reluctantly, considering its European focus a vestige of colonialism.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;

Despite Neoclassicism's association with European domination, it remained favored by the Mexican government after Independence and was used in major government commissions at the end of the century. However, indigenous themes appeared in paintings and sculptures. One indigenous figure depicted in Neoclassical style is Tlahuicol, done by [[Catalan people|Catalan]] artist Manuel Vilar in 1851. In 1887, [[Porfirio Díaz]] commissioned the statue of the last Aztec emperor, [[Cuauhtémoc]], which can be seen on [[Paseo de la Reforma]]. Cuauhtémoc is depicted with a toga-like cloak with a feathered headdress similar to an Etruscan or Trojan warrior rather than an Aztec emperor. The base has elements reminiscent of Mitla and Roman architecture. This base contains bronze plates depicting scenes from the Spanish conquest, but focusing on the indigenous figures.&lt;ref name="neoclassbrit" /&gt;

There were two reasons for this shift in preferred subject. The first was that Mexican society denigrated colonial culture—the indigenous past was seen as more truly Mexican.&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; The other factor was a worldwide movement among artists to confront society, which began around 1830. In Mexico, this anti-establishment sentiment was directed at the Academy of San Carlos and its European focus.&lt;ref name="pazp2"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 19th century, the Romantic style of painting was introduced into Mexico and the rest of Latin America by foreign travelers interested in the newly independent country. One of these was [[Bavaria]]n artist [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]], who lived in the country from 1831 to 1834. He painted scenes with dynamic composition and bright colors in accordance with Romantic style, looking for striking, sublime, and beautiful images in Mexico as well as other areas of Latin America. However much of Rugendas's works are sketches for major canvases, many of which were never executed. Others include Englishman [[Daniel Egerton]], who painted landscapes in the British Romantic tradition, and German [[Carl Nebel]], who primarily created [[lithograph]]s of the various social and ethnic populations of the country.&lt;ref name="foreigntravel"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253334 |title=Foreign Travelers |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:VelorioJaraDF.JPG|thumb|right|''El Velorio'' by [[José María Jara]] 1889]]
A number of native-born artists at the time followed the European Romantic painters in their desire to document the various cultures of Mexico. These painters were called ''[[Costumbrismo|costumbristas]]'', a word deriving from ''costumbre'' (custom). The styles of these painters were not always strictly Romantic, involving other styles as well. Most of these painters were from the upper classes and educated in Europe. While the European painters viewed subjects as exotic, the costumbristas had a more nationalistic sense of their home countries. One of these painters was [[Agustín Arrieta]] from Puebla, who applied realistic techniques to scenes from his home city, capturing its brightly painted tiles and ceramics. His scenes often involved everyday life such as women working in kitchen and depicted black and Afro-Mexican vendors.&lt;ref name="costumbristas"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253335 |title=Costumbristas |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Nineteenth Century to the Revolution===
[[File:NezahualcoyotlGardenTADF.JPG|thumb|180px|A bronze casting (1888–1889) of [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]], by [[Jesús F. Contreras]] at the Garden of the Triple Alliance, Filomeno Mata street, historical center of Mexico City.]]
[[File:SceneTortureCuautemocMonumentDF.jpg|thumb|[[Cuauhtemoc]]'s torture on a monument to him on the Paseo de la Reforma, by [[Gabriel Guerra]] (1847–1893).]]
In the mid-to late 19th century Latin American academies began to shift away from severe Neoclassicism to “academic realism”. Idealized and simplified depictions became more realistic, with emphasis on details. Scenes in this style were most often portraits of the upper classes, Biblical scenes, and battles—especially those from the Independence period. When the Academy of San Carlos was reopened after a short closure in 1843, its new Spanish and Italian faculty pushed this realist style. Despite government support and nationalist themes, native artists were generally shorted in favor of Europeans.&lt;ref name="realismbrit" /&gt;

One of the most important painters in Mexico in the mid 19th century was Catalan [[Pelegrí Clavé]], who painted landscapes but was best known for his depictions of the intellectual elite of Mexico City. Realist painters also attempted to portray Aztec culture and people by depicting settings inhabited by indigenous people, using live indigenous models and costumes based on those in Conquest era codices. One of these was [[Félix Parra]], whose depictions of the conquest empathized with the suffering of the indigenous. In 1869, José Obregón painted ''The Discovery of Pulque''; he based his depictions of architecture on [[Mixtec]] codices, but misrepresented temples as a setting for a throne.&lt;ref name="realismbrit"&gt;dead link {{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253336 |title=Realism |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of the 19th century after Independence is considered to have declined, especially during the late 19th century and early 20th, during the regime of [[Porfirio Díaz]] (1876–1911).  Although during this time, painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts were often limited to imitation of European styles,&lt;ref name="tburton"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1205-dr-atl-and-the-revolution-in-mexico-s-art |title= Dr. Atl and the revolution in Mexico's art |first=Tony |last=Burton |date= March 14, 2008 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the emergence of young artists, such as [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Saturnino Herrán]], increased the focus on Mexican-themed works. This meant that following the military phase of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the 1920s, Mexican artists made huge strides is forging a robust artistic nationalism.

In this century there are examples of murals such as folkloric style created between 1855 and 1867 in La Barca, Jalisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/semanario/index.php?id_nota=02042008173408 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030053129/http://www.arts-history.mx/semanario/index.php?id_nota=02042008173408 |archivedate=2014-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Highlights at this time: Pelegrín Clavé, [[Juan Cordero]], Felipe Santiago Gutiérrez and José Agustín Arrieta.
In Mexico, in 1846 he was hired to direct Pelegrín Clavé's reopening of the Academy of San Carlos, a body from which he promoted the historical and landscaping themes with a pro-European vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/cercadetuarte/pintura.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015220757/http://www.geocities.com/cercadetuarte/pintura.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-15 |title=Pintura |website=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of San Carlos continued to advocate classic, European-style training until 1913. In this year, the academy was partially integrated with [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM). Between 1929 and the 1950s, the academy’s architecture program was split off as a department of the university; the programs in painting, sculpture, and engraving were renamed the National School of Expressive Arts, now the [[Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas "Rafael Rodríguez Padilla"|Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas]] (ENAP). Both moved to the south of the city in the mid-20th century, to [[Ciudad Universitaria]] and [[Xochimilco]] respectively, leaving only some graduate programs in fine arts in the original academy building in the [[historic center of Mexico City|historic center]]. ENAP remains one of the main centers for the training of Mexico’s artists.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;

===Mexican muralism and Revolutionary art===
[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 6 063.jpg|thumb|Detail of mural "Gente y paisaje de Michoacán" at the Palacio de Gobierno in [[Michoacán]] (1962)]]
{{Further|Mexican muralism}}

While a shift to more indigenous and Mexican themes appeared in the 19th century, the [[Mexican Revolution]] from 1910 to 1920 had a dramatic effect on Mexican art.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arquitectuba" /&gt; The conflict resulted in the rise of the Partido Revolucionario Nacional (renamed the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]]), which took the country in a socialist direction. The government became an ally to many of the intellectuals and artists in Mexico City&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; and commissioned murals for public buildings to reinforce its political messages including those that emphasized Mexican rather than European themes. These were not created for popular or commercial tastes; however, they gained recognition not only in Mexico, but in the United States.&lt;ref name="pazp24"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

This production of art in conjunction with government propaganda is known as the Mexican Modernist School or the Mexican Muralist Movement, and it redefined art in Mexico.&lt;ref name="pazp298299"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.298-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavio Paz gives [[José Vasconcelos]] credit for initiating the Muralist movement in Mexico by commissioning the best-known painters in 1921 to decorate the walls of public buildings. The commissions were politically motivated—they aimed to glorify the [[Mexican Revolution]] and redefine the Mexican people vis-à-vis their indigenous and Spanish past.&lt;ref name="pazp11"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these commissioned paintings were at [[San Ildefonso College|San Ildefonso]] done by Fernando Leal, [[Fermín Revueltas]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[Diego Rivera]]. The first true fresco in the building was the work of [[Jean Charlot]]. However, technical errors were made in the construction of these murals: a number of them began to blister and were covered in wax for preservation.&lt;ref name="pazp12"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roberto Montenegro]] painted the [[San Pedro y San Pablo College (Museum of Light)|former church and monastery of San Pedro y San Pablo]], but the mural in the church was painted in [[tempera]] and began to flake. In the monastery area, Montenegro painted the ''Feast of the Holy Cross,'' which depicts Vasconcelos as the protector of Muralists. Vasconcelos was later blanked out and a figure of a woman was painted over him.&lt;ref name="pazp1213"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first protagonist in the production of modern murals in Mexico was [[Dr. Atl]]. Dr Atl was born “Gerard Murillo” in [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]] in 1875. He changed his name in order to identify himself as Mexican. Atl worked to promote [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexico's folk art and handcrafts]]. While he had some success as a painter in Guadalajara, his radical ideas against academia and the government prompted him to move to more liberal Mexico City. In 1910, months before the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]], Atl painted the first modern mural in Mexico. He taught major artists to follow him, including those who came to dominate Mexican mural painting.&lt;ref name="tburton" /&gt;

The muralist movement reached its height in the 1930s with four main protagonists: [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and Fernando Leal. It is the most studied part of Mexico's art history.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alee"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Anthony |date=Spring 1999 |title= Mexican murals and their meaning |journal=Art Journal |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; All were artists trained in classical European techniques and many of their early works are imitations of then-fashionable European paintings styles, some of which were adapted to Mexican themes.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pazp298299" /&gt; The political situation in Mexico from the 1920s to 1950s and the influence of Dr. Atl prompted these artists to break with European traditions, using bold indigenous images, lots of color, and depictions of human activity, especially of the masses, in contrast to the solemn and detached art of Europe.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;

Preferred mediums generally excluded traditional canvases and church porticos and instead were the large, then-undecorated walls of Mexico's government buildings. The main goal in many of these paintings was the glorification of Mexico's pre-Hispanic past as a definition of Mexican identity.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; They had success in both Mexico and the United States, which brought them fame and wealth as well as Mexican and American students.&lt;ref name="pazp24" /&gt;

These muralists revived the fresco technique for their mural work, although Siqueiros moved to industrial techniques and materials such as the application of [[pyroxilin]], a commercial enamel used for airplanes and automobiles.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; One of Rivera's earliest mural efforts emblazoned the courtyard of the Ministry of Education with a series of dancing tehuanas (natives of [[Tehuantepec]] in southern Mexico). This four-year project went on to incorporate other contemporary indigenous themes, and it eventually encompassed 124 frescoes that extended three stories high and two city blocks long.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; The [[Abelardo L. Rodriguez Market, Mexico City|Abelardo Rodriguez Market]] was painted in 1933 by students of Diego Rivera, one of whom was [[Isamu Noguchi]].&lt;ref name="pazp16"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important figure of this time period was [[Frida Kahlo]], the wife of Diego Rivera. While she painted canvases instead of murals, she is still considered part of the Mexican Modernist School as her work emphasized Mexican folk culture and colors.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dgoddard"&gt;{{cite news |title= enfoque ; Artistic update ; Mexican art featured at Blue Star and the Instituto de Mexico |first= Dan R. |last= Goddard |newspaper=Conexion |location=San Antonio, Texas |date=May 20, 2004 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo's self-portraits during the 1930s and 40s were in stark contrast to the lavish murals artists like her husband were creating at the time. Having suffered a crippling bus accident earlier in her teenage life, she began to challenge Mexico's obsession with the female body. Her portraits, purposefully small, addressed a wide range of topics not being addressed by the mainstream art world at the time. These included motherhood, domestic violence, and male egoism. 

Her paintings never had subjects wearing lavish jewelry or fancy clothes like those found in muralist paintings. Instead, she would sparsely dress herself up, and when there were accessories, it added that much more importance to them. She would also depict herself in very surreal, unsettling scenarios like in ''[[The Two Fridas]]'' where she depicts two versions of herself, one with a broken heart and one with a healthy infusing the broken heart with “hopeful” blood., or Henry Ford Hospital where she depicts herself in having an abortion and the struggle she had in real life coming to terms with it.

Although she was the wife of Diego Rivera, her self-portraits stayed rather obscured from the public eye until well after her passing in 1954.  Her art has grown in popularity and she is seen by many to be one of the earliest and most influential feminist artists of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meade |first=Teresa |title=The History of Modern Latin America |year=2016 |pages=192-193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selling Mexican art abroad===
Despite maintaining an active national art scene, Mexican artists after the muralist period had a difficult time breaking into the international art market. One reason for this is that in the Americas, Mexico City was replaced by New York as the center of the art community, especially for patronage.&lt;ref name="pazp25"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Mexico, government sponsorship of art in the 20th century (dominated until 2000 by the PRI party) meant religious themes and criticism of the government were effectively censored. This was mostly passive, with the government giving grants to artists who conformed to their requirements.&lt;ref name="rgallop11" /&gt;

===Other Artistic Expressions 1920–1950===
[[File:HoyTamayoBADF.JPG|thumb|300px|''Mexico de Hoy'' by Rufino Tamayo on the first floor of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]]]]
The first to break with the nationalistic and political tone of the muralist movement was [[Rufino Tamayo]]. For this reason he was first appreciated outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="pazp2425"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Tamayo was a contemporary to Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco, and trained at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes. Like them he explored Mexican identity in his work after the Mexican Revolution. However, he rejected the political Social Realism popularized by the three other artists and was rejected by the new establishment.&lt;ref name="miami" /&gt;

He left for New York in 1926 where success allowed him to exhibit in his native Mexico. His lack of support for the post-Revolutionary government was controversial. Because of this he mostly remained in New York, continuing with his success there and later in Europe. His rivalry with the main three Mexican muralists continued both in Mexico and internationally through the 1950s. Even a belated honorific of “The Fourth Great One” was controversial.&lt;ref name="miami"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexican Master |author= Carlos Suarez De Jesus |url= http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2007-07-05/culture/mexican-master/full |newspaper=Miami New Times |location=Miami |date=July 5, 2007 |accessdate=November 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, [[Wolfgang Paalen]] published the extremely influential ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]'' magazine in Mexico City, which focussed on a transitional movement between surrealism to abstract expressionism.

In 1953, [[Museo Experimental El Eco]] (in Mexico City) opened; it was created by [[Mathias Goeritz]].

===The Rupture Movement===
{{Further|Generación de la Ruptura}}

[[File:Murayl y tempusfugit.jpg|thumb|160px|A mural and clock sculpture by [[Manuel Felguerez]] at [[Universidad La Salle]], Campus central.]]
The first major movement after the muralists was the [[Generación de la Ruptura|Rupture Movement]], which began in the 1950s and 1960s with painters such as [[José Luis Cuevas]], Gilberto Navarro, [[Rafael Coronel]], Alfredo Casaneda, and sculptor [[Juan Soriano]]. They rejected social realism and nationalism and incorporated surrealism, visual paradoxes, and elements of Old World painting styles.&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rfajardo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fajardo |first=Renee |date=September 10, 2003 |title= Miradas Del Arte Mexicano; A modern perspective on contemporary Mexican art |journal=La Voz Bilinguë |page=25 |location=Denver, Colorado }}&lt;/ref&gt; This break meant that later Mexican artists were generally not influenced by muralism or by Mexican folk art.&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt;

José Luis Cuevas created self-portraits in which he reconstructed scenes from famous paintings by Spanish artists such as [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Francisco de Goya]], and [[Picasso]]. Like Kahlo before him, he drew himself but instead of being centered, his image is often to the side, as an observer. The goal was to emphasize the transformation of received visual culture.&lt;ref name="trends1950"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253344 |title=Trends 1950–1970 |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important figure during this time period was Swiss-Mexican [[Gunther Gerzso]], but his work was a “hard-edged variant”{{cite quote|date=January 2012}}&lt;!--Is this is a quotation from a critic, or "scare-quotes"?--&gt; of Abstract Expressionism, based on clearly defined geometric forms as well as colors, with an effect that makes them look like low relief. His work was a mix of European abstraction and Latin American influences, including Mesoamerican ones.&lt;ref name="trends1950" /&gt;&lt;ref name="violencia"&gt;{{cite news |title= Opinion invitada/ Gunther Gerzso/Gunther Gerzso: una violencia metaforica |first=Cuauhtemoc |last=Medina |newspaper=Mural |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=April 3, 2000 |page=9 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Invited opinion/Gunther Gerzo:metaphoric violence }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[watercolor]] field we can distinguish [[Edgardo Coghlan]] and [[Ignacio Barrios]] who were not aligned to a specific artistic movement but were not less important.

===The Olympics in Mexico City (1968); later===
"Designed by [[Mathias Goeritz]], a series of sculptures ... [lined] the "Route of Friendship" ([[Ruta de la Amistad]]) in celebration of the Olympics ... In contestation to the government-sanctioned artistic exhibition for the Olympics, a group of diverse, independent visual artists organize a counterpresentation entitled ''[[Salón Independiente]]'', or ''Independent Salon''; the exhibition signifies a key event in the resistance by artists of state-controlled cultural policies. This show of antigovernment efforts by artists would also be expressed in a mural in support of student movement's protests; the work became known as the ''Mural Efímero'' (or ''Ephemeral Mural'')" at [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]]".&lt;ref name="ZaragozaXXV"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M.

Saragoza, Editors|title=Mexico Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic: Volume One|date=2012|isbn=978-0-313-34948-5|page=XXV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third Independent Salon was staged in 1970. In 1976 "[[Fernando Gambao]] spearheads the organization of an exposition of abstract art entitled ''El Geometrismo Mexicano Una Tendencia Actual''".&lt;ref name="ZaragozaXXVI"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M.

"In an attempt to reassess ... post-1968 Mexican art, the Museum of Science and Art at UNAM" organized in 2007, the exhibition ''La Era de la Discrepancia. Arte y cultura visual en México 1968-1997''
&lt;ref name="ZaragozaXXXIII"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M. Saragoza, Ana Paula Ambrosi, Silvia D. Zárate, Alex M. Saragoza, Editors|title=Mexico Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic: Volume One|date=2012|isbn=978-0-313-34948-5|page=XXXIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 the exhibition ''Mexico: Esplendor de Treinta Siglos'', started its world tour at [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.

===Neo-expressionism===
From the 1960s to the 1980s [[Neo-expressionist]] art was represented in Mexico by [[Manuel Felguerez]], Teresa Cito, Alejandro Pinatado, and [[Jan Hendrix]].&lt;ref name="rfajardo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huella"&gt;{{cite news |title= Manuel Felguerez: La huella de su arte |first=Leticia |last=Sanchez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=July 11, 1997 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Manuel Felguerez:The mark of his art }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss-German artist, [[Mathias Goeritz]], in the 1950s created public sculptures including the ''Torres Satélite'' in [[Ciudad Satélite]]. In the 1960s, he became central to the development of abstract and other modern art along with [[José Luis Cuevas]] and [[Pedro Friedeberg]].&lt;ref name="rogallery"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rogallery.com/Goeritz_Mathias/goeritz-biography.html |title= Mathias Goeritz, German-Mexican (1915–1990) |publisher= RO Gallery |location=Mexico City |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neomexicanismo===
In the mid-1980s, the next major movement in Mexico was Neomexicanismo, a slightly surreal, somewhat kitsch and postmodern version of Social Realism that focused on popular culture rather than history.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; The name ''neomexicanismo'' was originally used by critics to belittle the movement.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Works were not necessarily murals: they used other mediums such as collage and often parodied and allegorized cultural icons, mass media, religion, and other aspects of Mexican culture. This generation of artists were interested in traditional Mexican values and exploring their roots—often questioning or subverting them. Another common theme was Mexican culture vis-à-vis globalization.&lt;ref name="artmod"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mam.org.mx/exposiciones/actuales/376-ineomexicanismos-ficciones-identitarias-en-el-mexico-de-los-ochenta |title=¿Neomexicanismos?

===Postmodern===
Art from the 1990s to the present is roughly categorized as Postmodern, although this term has been used to describe works created before the 1990s. Major artists associated with this label include [[Betsabeé Romero]],&lt;ref name="nunes"&gt;{{cite news |title= ART IN REVIEW; Betsabee Romero |first=Ken |last=Johnson |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/28/arts/art-in-review-betsabee-romero.html |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York |date=July 28, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monica Castillo]], [[Francisco Larios]],&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt; Martha Chapa and Diego Toledo.&lt;ref name="rfajardo" /&gt;

The success of Mexican artists is demonstrated by their inclusion in galleries in New York, London, and [[Zurich]].&lt;ref name="rgallop10"&gt;Gallo, 2004 p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art collections and galleries===
In 1974 Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil (MACG), a gallery and museum, opened.

[[Museo Tamayo de Arte Contemporáneo]] opened in Mexico City in 1981. The [[Museo Nacional de Arte|National Museum of Art]] (MUNAL) opened in 1982.

[[Centro Cultural Arte Contemporáneo]] opened in Mexico City in 1986, now defunct. "In 1998 ... with the sudden death of its chief executive, [[Televisa]] closed ... [the gallery] for a time, as the turnover in the company coincided with a drastic drop in the company's profitability".

[[Kurimanzutto]]—a private gallery was founded in 1999.&lt;ref name="rgallop11"&gt;Gallo, 2004 p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 the [[Museo Dolores Olmedo|Olmedo Museum]]&lt;ref name="Zaragoza51"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M. Saragoza, Ana Paula Ambrosi, Silvia D. Zárate, Alex M.

In 1996 the [[Jacques Gelman|Gelman collection]] was donated to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (in New York); part of the Gelmans' collection is on display in the [[Cuernavaca#Museo Muros|Muros Museum]] in [[Cuernavaca]].

[[Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo]] (MUAC) opened in 2008.

Private art exhibition is concentrated  to major urban centers, in particular [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo Léon]], [[Guadalajara]], [[Oaxaca City]] and [[Puebla]].&lt;ref name="Zaragoza51"/&gt;

===Art criticism===
[[Octavio Mercado]] said in 2012 that the activity of art criticism still can be found in specialized magazines and nationally disseminated newspapers; furthermore, a new generation of art critics include [[Daniela Wolf]], [[Ana Elena Mallet]], [[Gabriella Gómez-Mont]], and [[Pablo Helguera]].
&lt;ref name="Zaragoza59"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M. Saragoza, Ana Paula Ambrosi, Silvia D. Zárate, Alex M.

==21st century==

[[File:Mexican Street Artist.jpg|thumb|Mexican artist creating an ephemeral work of [[street art]] in chalk on the streets of the Historical Center of Mexico City]]
Just like many other parts in the world, Mexico has adopted some modern techniques like with the existence of street artists depicting popular paintings from Mexico throughout history or original content.

===Modern Mexican visual artists===

==Popular arts and handcrafts==
{{Main|Mexican handcrafts and folk art}}
[[File:Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos votive 1920 1922.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ex-voto]] painting from the early 1920s honoring Our Lady of [[San Juan de los Lagos]].]]
[[Mexican handcrafts and folk art]], called ''artesanía'' in Mexico, is a complex category of items made by hand or in small workshops for utilitarian, decorative, or other purposes. These include ceramics, wall hangings, certain types of paintings, and textiles.&lt;ref name="mexpopart"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mexipopulart.org/mexicanpopularart.aspx |title= Mexican Popular Arts |accessdate= 2009-11-28 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005022/http://mexipopulart.org/mexicanpopularart.aspx |archivedate= 2010-03-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the more formal arts, artesanía has both indigenous and European roots and is considered a valued part of Mexico's ethnic heritage.&lt;ref name="pomar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/interior/index.php?idNota=4038&amp;p=nota |title=Centenaria presencia de las artesanías |first=Maria Teresa |last=Pomar |date=Nov–Dec 1999 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=100 years of arts and crafts |accessdate=2009-11-28 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This linking among the arts and cultural identity was most strongly forged by the country's political, intellectual, and artistic elite in the first half of the 20th century, after the Mexican Revolution.&lt;ref name="pomar" /&gt; Artists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[Rufino Tamayo]], and [[Frida Kahlo]] used artesanía as inspiration for a number of their murals and other works.&lt;ref name="pomar" /&gt; Unlike the fine arts, artesanía is created by common people and those of indigenous heritage, who learn their craft through formal or informal apprenticeship.&lt;ref name="mexpopart" /&gt; The linking of artesanía and Mexican identity continues through television, movies, and tourism promotion.&lt;ref name="iturbe"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Iturbe |first1=Mercedes |editor1-first=Mercedes |editor1-last=Iturbe |title= Folk Art Aesthetics and Poetry in Belleza y Poesía en el arte popular mexicano |year=1996 |publisher= CVS Publicaciones |location= Querétaro,QRO |language=Spanish, English |isbn=968-7377-14-3 |pages=223–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the artesanía produced in Mexico consists of ordinary things made for daily use. They are considered artistic because they contain decorative details or are painted in bright colors, or both.&lt;ref name="mexpopart" /&gt; The bold use of colors in crafts and other constructions extends back to pre-Hispanic times. These were joined by other colors introduced by European and Asian contact, always in bold tones.&lt;ref name="aprahamian1112"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |pages=11–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design motifs vary from purely indigenous to mostly European with other elements thrown in. Geometric designs connected to Mexico's pre-Hispanic past are prevalent, and items made by the country's remaining purely indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="aprahamian31"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Motifs from nature are popular, possibly more so than geometric patterns in both pre-Hispanic and European designs. They are especially prevalent in wall-hangings and ceramics.&lt;ref name="aprahamian36"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |page=36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best of Mexico's handcrafts is [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera pottery]] produced in [[Puebla]].&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; It has a mix of Chinese, Arab, Spanish, and indigenous design influences.&lt;ref name="delpaso"&gt;{{cite book |last1= del Paso |first1=Fernando |editor1-first=Mercedes |editor1-last=Iturbe |title= Form and Color in the Manual Arts of Mexico in Belleza y Poesía en el arte popular mexicano |year=1996 |publisher= CVS Publicaciones |location= Querétaro,QRO |language=Spanish, English |isbn=968-7377-14-3 |pages=245–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known folk paintings are the ''ex-voto'' or ''[[retablo]]'' [[Votive paintings of Mexico|votive paintings]]. These are small commemorative paintings or other artwork created by a believer, honoring the intervention of a saint or other figure. The untrained style of ex-voto painting was appropriated during the mid-20th century by Kahlo, who believed they were the most authentic expression of Latin American art.&lt;ref name="trends1970"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253345 |title=Trends 1970-present |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Revolutionary general [[Pancho Villa]] himself starred in some silent films.  In 2003, [[HBO]] broadcast ''[[And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself]]'', with Antonio Banderas as Villa; the film focuses on the making of the film ''[[The Life of General Villa]]''.  Villa consciously used cinema to shape his public image.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Mistron. "The Role of Pancho Villa in the Mexican and American Cinema." ''Studies in Latin American Popular Culture'' 2:1-13 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sound film in Mexico was made in 1931, called ''Desde Santa''. The first Mexican film genre appeared between 1920 and 1940, called ''ranchero''.&lt;ref name="truax"&gt;{{cite news |title=El Cine Mexicano Vuelve a Brillar |first=Eileen |last=Truax |newspaper=La Opinion |location=Los Angeles |date=January 29, 2007 |pages=1A, 16A |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican Cinema Shines Again }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema|Mexico's Golden Age of Cinema]] is regarded as the 1940s and 1950s, two films from the mid to late 1930s, ''Allá en el Rancho Grande'' (1936) and ''Vamanos con Pancho Villa'' (1935), set the standard of this age thematically, aesthetically, and ideologically. These films featured archetypal star figures and symbols based on broad national mythologies. Some of the mythology according to [[Carlos Monsiváis]], includes the participants in family melodramas, the masculine ''[[charro]]s'' of ranchero films, [[femme fatale]]s (often played by [[María Félix]] and [[Dolores del Río]]), the indigenous peoples of [[Emilio Fernández]]’s films, and [[Cantinflas]]’s ''peladito'' (urban miscreant).&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt;

Settings were often ranches, the battlefields of the Revolution, and [[cabaret]]s. Movies about the Mexican Revolution focused on the initial overthrow of the [[Porfirio Díaz]] government rather than the fighting among the various factions afterwards. They also tended to focus on rural themes as “Mexican”, even though the population was increasingly urban.&lt;ref name="strayer"&gt;Strayer, 2009 p.7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico had two advantages in filmmaking during this period. The first was a generation of talented actors and filmmakers. These included actors such as [[María Félix]], [[Jorge Negrete]], [[Pedro Armendáriz]], [[Pedro Infante]], [[Cantinflas]], and directors such as [[Emilio Fernández|Emilio “El Indio” Fernandez]] and cinematographer [[Gabriel Figueroa]]. Many of these starts had success in the United States and at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] .&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="macdonald"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacDonald |first1=Christine |year=1994 |title= Cinema renaissance: Mexican films captivate world audiences |journal=Business Mexico |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=60–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the corner of La Brea and [[Hollywood Boulevard]], there is a sculpture of four women who represent the four pillars of the cinema industry, one of whom is Mexican actress [[Dolores del Rio]] .&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt; Gabriel Figueroa is known for black-and-white camerawork that is generally stark and expressionist, with simple but sophisticated camera movement.&lt;ref name="roads"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=Alex |date=November 1995 |title=Roads to the south: In praise of Mexican cinema |journal=Film Comment |volume=31 |issue=6 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second advantage was that Mexico was not heavily involved in the [[Second World War]], and therefore had a greater supply of celluloid for films, then also used for bombs.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

[[File:Bird of Paradise (1932) 1.jpg|thumb|300px|A scene from ''Bird of Paradise'' (1932) with [[Dolores del Río]].]]
In the 1930s, the government became interested in the industry in order to promote cultural and political values. Much of the production during the Golden Age was financed with a mix of public and private money, with the government eventually taking a larger role. In 1942 the Banco Cinematográfico financed almost all of the industry, coming under government control by 1947. This gave the government extensive censorship rights through deciding which projects to finance.&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt; While the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) censored films in many ways in the 1940s and 1950s, it was not as repressive as other Spanish speaking countries, but it played a strong role in how Mexico's government and culture was portrayed.&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

The Golden Age ended in the late 1950s, with the 1960s dominated by poorly made imitations of Hollywood westerns and comedies. These films were increasingly shot outdoors and popular films featured stars from [[lucha libre]]. Art and experimental film production in Mexico has its roots in the same period, which began to bear fruit in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; Director [[Paul Leduc (film director)|Paul Leduc]] surfaced in the 1970s, specializing in films without dialogue. His first major success was with ''Reed: Insurgent Mexico'' (1971) followed by a biography of [[Frida Kahlo]] called ''Frida'' (1984). He is the most consistently political of modern Mexican directors. In the 1990s, he filmed ''Latino Bar'' (1991) and ''Dollar Mambo'' (1993). His silent films generally have not had commercial success.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

In the late 20th century the main proponent of Mexican art cinema was Arturo Ripstein Jr.. His career began with a spaghetti Western-like film called ''Tiempo de morir'' in 1965 and who some consider the successor to [[Luis Buñuel]] who worked in Mexico in the 1940s. Some of his classic films include ''El Castillo de la pureza'' (1973), ''Lugar sin limites'' (1977) and ''La reina de la noche'' (1994) exploring topics such as family ties and even homosexuality, dealing in cruelty, irony, and tragedy.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;
State censorship was relatively lax in the 1960s and early 1970s, but came back during the latter 1970s and 1980s, monopolizing production and distribution.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

Another factor was that many Mexican film making facilities were taken over by Hollywood production companies in the 1980s, crowding out local production.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; The quality of films was so diminished that for some of these years,{{which|date=January 2012}} [[Ariel Award|Mexico's Ariel film award]] was suspended for lack of qualifying candidates.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt; Popular filmmaking decreased but the art sector grew, sometimes producing works outside the view of censors such as [[Jorge Fons]]’ 1989 film ''Rojo Amanecer'' on the [[Tlatelolco massacre|1968 Tlatelolco massacre]]. The movie was banned by the government but received support in Mexico and abroad. The film was shown although not widely.{{elucidate|date=January 2012}}&lt;!--Shown where? In Mexico? I thought it was banned. From whom did it receive support?--&gt; It was the beginning of more editorial freedom for filmmakers in Mexico.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

Starting in the 1990s, Mexican cinema began to make a comeback, mostly through co-production with foreign interests. One reason for international interest in Mexican cinema was the wild success of the 1992 film [[Like Water for Chocolate (film)|''Como Agua Para Chocolate'']] (''Like Water for Chocolate'').&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; In 1993, this film was the largest grossing foreign language film in U.S. history and ran in a total of 34 countries.&lt;ref name="macdonald" /&gt; Since then, Mexican film divided into two genres. Those for a more domestic audience tend to be more personal and more ambiguously political such as ''Pueblo de Madera'', ''La Vida Conjugal'', and ''Angel de fuego''. Those geared for international audiences have more stereotypical Mexican images and include ''Solo con tu Pareja'', ''La Invencion de Cronos'' along with ''Como Agua para Chocolate''.&lt;ref name="macdonald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

Mexico's newest generation of successful directors includes [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], and [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. Films include ''[[Children of Men|Cuarón/Children of Men]]'' filmed in England and ''[[Pan's Labyrinth|El Laberinto del Fauno]]'', which was a Mexican/Spanish production. Film professionals in the early 21st century tend to be at least bilingual (Spanish and English) and are better able to participate in the global market for films than their predecessors.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

==Photography in Mexico==
[[File:MetlacBridgeKahlo.JPG|thumb|300px|An image of the Metlac Bridge, taken by [[Guillermo Kahlo]].]]
Photography came to Mexico in the form of [[daguerreotype]] about six months after its discovery, and it spread quickly. It was initially used for portraits of the wealthy (because of its high cost), and for shooting landscapes and pre-Hispanic ruins.&lt;ref name="monroy"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/hitoria-de-la-fotografia-en-mexico.html |title= Historia de la Fotografía en México |first=Rebeca |last=Monroy Nasr |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=History of Mexican photography |accessdate=November 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another relatively common type of early photographic portraits were those of recently deceased children, called ''little angels,'' which persisted into the first half of the 20th century. This custom derived from a Catholic tradition of celebrating a dead child's immediate acceptance into heaven, bypassing purgatory. This photography replaced the practice of making drawings and other depictions of them as this was considered a “happy occasion.”&lt;ref name="sleeping"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marino |first1=Daniela |date=Summer 1997 |title= Prayer for a sleeping child: Iconography of the funeral ritual of little angels in Mexico |journal= The Journal of American Culture |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=37–49 |doi=10.1111/j.1542-734x.1997.2002_37.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formal portraits were the most common form of commercial photography through the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

Modern photography in Mexico did not begin as an art form, but rather as documentation, associated with periodicals and government projects. It dates to the [[Porfirio Díaz]] period of rule, or the ''Porfiriato'', from the late 19th century to 1910.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1086-the-legacy-of-agustin-victor-casasola-photographer-1874-1938 |title= The legacy of Agustin Victor Casasola (Photographer 1874–1938) |author=Rita Pomade |date=June 1, 2004 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn= 1028-9089 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp7"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Porfirian-era photography was heavily inclined toward the presentation of the nation's modernization to the rest of the world, with Mexico City as its cultural showpiece. This image was European-based with some indigenous elements for distinction.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp24"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylized images of the indigenous during the Porfirato were principally done by Ybañez y Sora in the [[costumbrista]] painting style, which was popular outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; The most important Porfirian era photographer was [[Guillermo Kahlo]], who worked with associate Hugo Brehme.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; Kahlo established his own studio in the first decade of the 1900s and was hired by businesses and the government to document architecture, interiors, landscapes, and factories.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp35"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahlo's style reflected the narratives of the period, solely focusing on major constructions and events, and avoiding the common populace.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp37"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; It avoided subjects that hinted at the political instability of the country at the time, such as [[strike action]]s.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp26"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; One major Kahlo project was the Photographic Inventory of Spanish Colonial Church Architecture in Mexico (1910), which consisted of twenty five albums sponsored by the federal government to document the remaining colonial architecture.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp25"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo's photography was used to link Mexico's past to its progress with political and social power provided in symbols and ideals, as well to link the government's aspirations with its colonial and pre-Hispanic past.{{clarify|date=January 2012}}&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp34"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Decena trágica.JPG|thumb|300px|A scene from the [[Decena Trágica]], February 1913, from the [[Agustín Casasola]] archives.]]
Another pioneer of Mexican photography was [[Agustín Casasola|Agustín Victor Casasola]]. Like Kahlo, he began his career in the Porfirato, but his career was focused on photography for periodicals. Again like Kahlo, Casasola's work prior to the Mexican Revolution focused on non-controversial photographs, focusing on the lives of the elite. The outbreak of civil war caused Casasola's choice of subject to change. He began to focus not only on portraits of the main protagonists (such as [[Francisco Villa]]) and general battle scenes, but on executions and the dead. He focused on people whose faces showed such expressions as pain, kindness, and resignation.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

His work during this time produced a large collection of photographs, many of which are familiar to Mexicans as they have been widely reprinted and reused, often without credit to Casasola. After the war, Casasola continued to photograph common people, especially migrants to Mexico City during the 1920s and 1930s. His total known archives comprise about half a million images with many of his works archived in the former monastery of San Francisco in [[Pachuca]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

Kahlo and Casasola are considered the two most important photographers to develop the medium in Mexico, with Kahlo defining architectural photography and Casasolas establishing photojournalism. Neither man thought of himself as an artist—especially not Casasolas—who thought of himself as a historian in the [[Positivism|Positivist]] tradition, but the photography of both show attention to detail, lighting, and placement of subjects for emotional or dramatic effect.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp1825"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.18-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the rest of the 20th century, most photography was connected to documentation. However, artistic trends from both inside and outside the country had an effect. In the 1920s, the dominant photographic style was [[Pictorialism]], in which images had a romantic or dream-like quality due to the use of filters and other techniques. American [[Edward Weston]] broke with this tradition, taking these effects away for more realistic and detailed images.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |title= Edward Weston: Pictorialist Pioneer |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 27, 2003 |pages=62–65 s }}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a split in the photography world between Pictorialists and Realists both inside and outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

Weston and his Italian assistant [[Tina Modotti]] were in Mexico from 1923 to 1926, allying themselves with Mexican Realist photographers [[Manuel Álvarez Bravo]] as well as muralists such as [[Gabriel Fernández Ledesma]]. These photographers' political and social aspirations matched those of the muralist movement and the new post-Revolution government.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp1718"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mariana Yampolsky]], originally from the U.S., became an important photographer in Mexico.  Photography and other arts shifted to depictions of the country's indigenous heritage and the glorification of the Mexican common people.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9" /&gt; This was mainly to reject the elitist and heavily European values of the Porfiriato, along with the increasing cultural influence of the United States in favor of an “authentic” and distinct Mexican identity.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp910"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Another was the government's decision to use this imagery, rather than the still-fresh memories of the battles and atrocities of the Revolution to promote itself.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp27"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Centro-fotografico-in-oaxaca-founded-by-toledo.jpg|thumb|[[Centro Fotográfico Álvarez Bravo]] at the [[Institute of Graphic Arts of Oaxaca]].]]

Manuel Alvarez Bravo experimented with abstraction in his photography and formed his own personal style concerned with Mexican rites and customs. He was active from the 1920s until his death in the 1990s. Like other artists of the 20th century, he was concerned with balancing international artistic trends with the expression of Mexican culture and people. His photographic techniques were concerned with transforming the ordinary into the fantastic. From the end of the 1930s to the 1970s his photography developed along with new technologies such as color, using the same themes. In the 1970s, he experimented with female nudes.&lt;ref name="aalonso"&gt;{{cite news |title= Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Mexico en imagenes |first=Alejandro |last=Alonso |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=June 13, 1997 |page=14 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Mexico in images }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These post-Revolution photographers influenced the generations after them, but the emphasis remained on documentary journalism, especially for newspapers. For this reason, the focus remained on social issues. This included work by [[Nacho López]] and [[Héctor García Cobos|Hector Garcia]], best known for their photography of the [[Tlatelolco massacre|student uprising of 1968]].&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

During the 1970s, a fusion of various styles retained a social focus.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; During the same period, institutions were established that dedicated themselves to the promotion of photography and conservation of photographs, such as the Centro de la Imagen, the Fototeca Nacional del [[INAH]], and the publication ''Luna Córnea''.&lt;ref name="grandes"&gt;{{cite news |title= Los 13 grandes de la fotografía mexicana |first=Yanet |last=Aguilar Sosa |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/sociedad/3014.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=November 30, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The 13 greats of Mexican photography }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photography in Mexico from the latter 20th century on remains mostly focused on photojournalism and other kinds of documentary. Francisco Mata de Rosas is considered the most notable photographer in contemporary Mexico mostly working with documentaries.{{according to whom|date=January 2012}} He has published a number of books including ''México Tenochtitlan'' and ''Tepito, Bravo el Barrio''. Eniac Martínez specializes in panoramas. Patricia Aridjis works with social themes, mostly to illustrate books. Gerardo Montiel Klint's work has been described as a “shadowing and dark world”, focusing on the angst and violence of adolescents.&lt;ref name="grandes" /&gt; The most recent generation of photographers work with new and digital technologies. One of these is [[Javier Orozco]] who specializes in interiors.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

However, purely artistic photography has had an impact. In 2002, a photographic exhibit by Daniela Rossell featured images of Mexican multimillionaires posing in their ostentatious homes, filled with expensive paintings, hunting trophies, crystal chandeliers, gold lamé wallpaper, and household help. The photographs set off a wave of social criticism as well as tabloid gossip.&lt;ref name="rgallop47"&gt;Gallo, 2004 p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vivienda prefabricada.jpg|thumb|[[Prefabricated]] house in [[Valencia]], [[Spain]].]]
'''Modular buildings''' and '''modular homes''' are [[prefabricated building]]s or [[house]]s that consist of repeated sections called modules. "Modular" is a construction method that involves constructing sections away from the building site, then delivering them to the intended site. Installation of the prefabricated sections is completed on site. Prefabricated sections are sometimes placed using a [[crane (machine)|crane]]. The modules can be placed side-by-side, end-to-end, or stacked, allowing a variety of configurations and styles.

Modular buildings, also called prefabricated homes or precision built homes, are built to equal or higher standards as on-site [[stick-built home]]s. The building method is referred to as permanent modular construction. 

Material for stick built and modular homes are the same. Modular homes are not doublewides or mobile homes. First, modular homes do not have axles or a metal frame, meaning that they are typically transported on flat-bed [[truck]]s. Modular buildings must conform to all relevant local building codes, while doublewides and mobile homes have metal under framing. Doublewides and mobile homes made in the United States are required to conform to federal codes governed by [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/ramh/mhs/faq|title=HUD- Manufactured Housing and Standards|website=Portal.hud.gov|access-date=2016-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504145914/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Fhousing%2Framh%2Fmhs%2Ffaq|archive-date=2016-05-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[File:Modular home (Palmer, Alaska - 2006).jpg|thumb|right|Modular home in [[Sutton, Alaska]]]]
Modular buildings may be used for long-term, temporary or permanent facilities, such as construction camps, schools and classrooms, civilian and military housing, and industrial facilities. Modular buildings are used in remote and rural areas where conventional construction may not be reasonable or possible, for example, the Halley VI accommodation pods used for a BAS Antarctic expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/polar-operations/sites-and-facilities/facility/halley/|title=Halley VI Research Station - British Antarctic Survey|website=Bas.ac.uk|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other uses have included churches, health care facilities, sales and retail offices, fast food restaurants and cruise ship construction. They can also be used in areas that have weather concerns, such as hurricanes.
{{toclimit|3}}
==Construction process==
Construction is offsite, using [[lean manufacturing]] techniques to prefabricate single or multi-story buildings in deliverable module sections. Permanent Modular Construction (PMC) buildings are manufactured in a controlled setting and can be constructed of wood, steel, or concrete. Modular components are typically constructed indoors on [[assembly lines]]. Modules' construction may take as little as ten days but more often one to three months. PMC modules can be integrated into site built projects or stand alone and can be delivered with [[Mechanical, electrical, and plumbing|MEP]], fixtures and interior finishes.

The buildings are 60% to 90% completed offsite in a factory-controlled environment, and transported and assembled at the final building site. This can comprise the entire building or be components or subassemblies of larger structures. In many cases, modular contractors work with traditional general contractors to exploit the resources and advantages of each type of construction. Completed modules are transported to the building site and assembled by a crane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modular.org/htmlPage.aspx?name=why_modular|title=Why Build Modular?|website=Modular.org|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placement of the modules may take from several hours to several days.

Permanent modular buildings are built to meet or exceed the same building codes and standards as site-built structures and the same architect-specified materials used in conventionally constructed buildings are used in modular construction projects. PMC can have as many stories as building codes allow. Unlike relocatable buildings, PMC structures are intended to remain in one location for the duration of their useful life.

==Manufacturing considerations==
The entire process of [[modular construction]] places significance on the design stage. This is where practices such as [[DFMA|Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA)]] are used to ensure that assembly tolerances are controlled throughout manufacture and assembly on site. It is vital that there is enough allowance in the design to allow the assembly to take up any "slack" or misalignment of components. The use of advanced [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] systems, [[3D printing]] and manufacturing control systems are important for modular construction to be successful. This is quite unlike on-site construction where the tradesman can often make the part to suit any particular installation.

==Advantages==
[[File:Modular Construction Timeline.jpg|thumb|Simultaneous site development and building construction at the plant reduces schedule by 30% to 50%]]

Modular buildings are argued to have advantages over conventional buildings, for a variety of reasons. 
*'''Speed of construction/faster return on investment'''. Modular construction allows for the building and the site work to be completed simultaneously. According to some materials, this can reduce the overall completion schedule by as much as 50%. This also reduces labor, financing and supervision costs. To save even more time and money, nearly all design and engineering disciplines are part of the manufacturing process. Also unique to modular construction is the ability to simultaneously construct a building’s floors, walls, ceilings, rafters, and roofs. During site-built construction, walls cannot be set until floors are in position, and ceilings and rafters cannot be added until walls are erected. On the other hand, with modular construction, walls, floors, ceilings, and rafters are all built at the same time, and then brought together in the same factory to form a building. This process can allow modular construction times of half that of conventional, stick-built construction.
*'''Indoor construction'''. Assembly is independent of weather, which can increase work efficiency and avoids damaged building material.
*'''Ability to service remote locations'''. Particularly in countries in which potential markets may be located far from industrial centers, such as Australia, there can be much higher costs to build a site-built house in a remote area or an area experiencing a construction boom such as mining towns. Modular buildings are also beneficial in providing medical and sanitary facilities where time, space, and money are an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://comstruc.com/modular-construction-advantages/|title=Modular Construction Advantages &amp; Modern Day Applications - Commercial Structures Corp.|date=2017-07-26|work=Commercial Structures Corp.|access-date=2018-03-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Low waste'''. With the same plans being constantly built, the manufacturer has records of exactly what quantity of materials are needed for a given job. With the consistency, builders can design systems that use common lengths of lumber, wallboard, etc., cut items with maximum efficiency, or be able to order special lengths in bulk. While waste from a site-built dwelling may typically fill several large dumpsters, construction of a modular dwelling generates much less waste. According to the UK group WRAP, up to a 90% reduction in materials can be achieved through the use of modular construction. Materials minimized include: wood pallets, shrink wrap, cardboard, plasterboard, timber, concrete, bricks, and cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrap.org.uk/sites/files/wrap/Modern%20Methods%20of%20Construction%20-%20Summmary.pdf|title=Current Practices and Future Potential in Modern Methods of Construction|access-date=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Environmentally friendly construction process'''. Modular construction reduces waste and site disturbance compared to site-built structures. The controlled environment of the factory allows for more accurate construction while allowing the extra materials to be recycled in-house.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.constructionworld.org/7-benefits-prefabricated-construction/|title=7 Benefits of Prefabricated Construction - Construction World|website=Constructionworld.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Flexibility'''. One can continually add to a modular building, including creating high rises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = High-rise housing going modular|url = http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/02/01/high-rise-housing-going-modular/|website=News.blogs.cnn.com|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the needs change, modular buildings can be disassembled and the modules relocated or refurbished for their next use reducing the demand for raw materials and minimizing the amount of energy expended to create a building to meet the new need. In essence, the entire building can be recycled in some cases.
*'''Quality'''. Combining traditional building techniques, quality manufacturing and third-party agencies who offer random inspections, testing, and certification services for quality control, commercial modular buildings are built in strict accordance with appropriate local, state, and national regulations and codes. Due to the need to transport modules to the final site, each module must be built to independently withstand travel and installation requirements. Thus the final module-to-module assembly of independently durable components can yield a final product that is more durable than site-built structures. Modular buildings often use [[Structural insulated panel|Structural Insulated Panels]] (SIPs) in construction, which offer a range of advantages over traditional building materials. SIPs panels are a light yet durable combination of panel board and either closed-cell [[polyurethane]] (PU) or expanded [[polystyrene]] (EPS) insulating foam. They are air-tight, and as such provide excellent thermal performance. They also offer superior damp and cold resistance when compared to timber and other materials, and are immune to both compression shrinking and cold bridging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.green-modular.com/blog/structural-insulated-panels/|title=Structural Insulated Panels {{!}}Green Modular|website=Green Modular|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modular units may also be designed to fit in with external aesthetics of any existing building and modular units once assembled can be virtually indistinguishable from a site-built structure.
* '''Improved Air Quality''' - Many of the indoor air quality issues identified in new construction result from high moisture levels in the framing materials. Because the modular structure is substantially completed in a factory-controlled setting using dry materials, the potential for high levels of moisture being trapped in the new construction is eliminated.

Modular buildings can also contribute to LEED requirements in any category site-built construction can, and can even provide an advantage in the areas of Sustainable Sites, Energy and Atmosphere, Materials and Resources, and Indoor Environmental Quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modular.org/marketing/documents/Modular_09V3LEED.pdf |title=Modular Building and the USGBC’s LEED ™ Version 3.0 2009 Building Rating System}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Modular construction can also provide an advantage in similar categories in the International Green Construction Code.

==Disadvantages==
*Volumetric: Transporting the completed modular building sections take up a lot of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pros and Cons of a Commercial Modular Building|url = http://www.modulartoday.com/pros-cons.html|website = www.modulartoday.com|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flexibility: Due to transport and sometimes manufacturing restrictions, module size can be limited, affecting room sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Prefab Housing Disadvantages|url = http://budgeting.thenest.com/prefab-housing-disadvantages-24540.html|website = Budgeting Money - The Nest|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some financial institutions may be hesitant to offer a loan for a modular home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learningcenter.statefarm.com/residence/buying-selling/what-to-know-when-buying-a-manufactured-home/|title=Buying a Manufactured Home|last=|first=|date=|website=State Farm|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market acceptance===
[[Image:Stoke newington raines court 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Raines Court is a multi-story modular housing block in [[Stoke Newington]], [[London]], one of the first two residential buildings in Britain of this type. (December 2005)]]
Some home buyers and some lending institutions resist consideration of modular homes as equivalent in value to site-built homes.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} While the homes themselves may be of equivalent quality, entrenched zoning regulations and psychological marketplace factors may create hurdles for buyers or builders of modular homes and should be considered as part of the decision-making process when exploring this type of home as a living and/or investment option. In the UK and Australia, modular homes have become accepted in some regional areas; however, they are not commonly built in major cities. Modular homes are becoming increasingly common in Japanese urban areas, due to improvements in design and quality, speed and compactness of onsite assembly, as well as due to lowering costs and ease of repair after earthquakes. Recent innovations allow modular buildings to be indistinguishable from site-built structures.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Surveys have shown that individuals can rarely tell the difference between a modular home and a site-built home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Factory-Built Construction and the American Homebuyer: Perceptions and Opportunities|url=https://www.huduser.gov/portal/Publications/pdf/Perceptions_of_factory_construction.pdf|format=PDF|website=Huduser.gov|page=9|accessdate = 2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modular homes vs. mobile homes===
Differences include the building codes that govern the construction, types of material used and how they are appraised by banks for lending purposes. Modular homes are built to either local or state building codes as opposed to manufactured homes, which are also built in a factory but are governed by a federal building code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.drysideproperty.com/mobile%20vs%20manuf%20vs%20modular.html|title=Mobile homes vs Manufactured homes vs Modular homes|last=Solutions|first=Dryside Property - Jennifer Mitchell and Magic Web|website=Drysideproperty.com|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The codes that govern the construction of modular homes are exactly the same codes that govern the construction of site-constructed homes.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} In the United States, all modular homes are constructed according to the [[International Building Code]] (IBC), IRC, BOCA or the code that has been adopted by the local jurisdiction.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} In some states, such as California, mobile homes must still be registered yearly, like vehicles or standard trailers, with the Department of Motor Vehicles or other state agency. This is true even if the owners remove the axles and place it on a permanent foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcd.ca.gov/manufactured-mobile-home/index.shtml|title=HCD Manufactured and Mobile Homes|website=Hcd.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognizing a mobile or manufactured home===
A mobile home should have a small metal tag on the outside of each section. If you cannot locate a tag, you should be able to find details about the home in the electrical panel box. This tag should also reveal a manufacturing date.&lt;ref name="freshome.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freshome.com/2013/03/27/10-basic-facts-about-modular-homes/|title=10 Basic Facts You Should Know About Modular Homes - Freshome.com|author=|date=13 November 2015|website=freshome.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modular homes do not have metal tags on the outside but will have a dataplate installed inside the home, usually under the kitchen sink or in a closet. The dataplate will provide information such as the manufacturer, third party inspection agency, appliance information, and manufacture date.

===Materials===
The materials used in modular homes are typically the same as site constructed homes. Wood-frame floors, walls and roof are often utilized. Some modular homes include brick or stone exteriors, granite counters and steeply pitched roofs. Modulars can be designed to sit on a perimeter foundation or basement. In contrast, mobile homes are constructed with a steel chassis that is integral to the integrity of the floor system. Modular buildings can be custom built to a client's specifications. Current designs include multi-story units, multi-family units and entire apartment complexes. The negative stereotype commonly associated with mobile homes has prompted some manufacturers to start using the term "off-site construction."

=== Financing ===
'''Mobile homes''' often require special lenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/housing/sfh/title/repair|title=HUD Financing Manufactured (Mobile) Homes|website=Portal.hud.gov|access-date=2016-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503104807/http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=%2Fprogram_offices%2Fhousing%2Fsfh%2Ftitle%2Frepair|archive-date=2016-05-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Modular homes''' on the other hand are financed as site built homes with a construction loan&lt;ref name="freshome.com"/&gt;

==Standards and zoning considerations==
Typically, modular dwellings are built to local, state or council code, resulting in dwellings from a given manufacturing facility having differing construction standards depending on the final destination of the modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/repealed_reg/lgheamhr1995693/ |title=Australian Government modular home regulations|website=Austlii.edu.au |accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most important zones that manufacturers have to take into consideration are local wind, heat, and snow load zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://homenation.com/zone-maps/ |title=Home Building Zone Maps }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, homes built for final assembly in a hurricane-prone, earthquake or flooding area may include additional bracing to meet local building codes. Steel and/or wood framing are common options for building a modular home.

Some US courts have ruled that [[zoning]] restrictions applicable to mobile homes do not apply to modular homes since modular homes are designed to have a permanent foundation.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Additionally, in the US, valuation differences between modular homes and site-built homes are often negligible in [[real estate appraisal]] practice; modular homes can, in some market areas, (depending on local appraisal practices per [[Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice]]) be evaluated the same way as site-built dwellings of similar quality. In Australia, manufactured home parks are governed by additional legislation that does not apply to permanent modular homes. Possible developments in equivalence between modular and site-built housing types for the purposes of [[real estate appraisal]]s, financing and zoning may increase the sales of modular homes over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modularhomesnetwork.com/building-codes/index.asp |title=Building Codes for Modular Homes |website=Modularhomesnetwork.com|accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Building strength===
Modular homes are designed to be stronger than traditional homes by, for example, replacing nails with screws, adding glue to joints, and using 8-10% more lumber than conventional housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disruptive Development: Modular Manufacturing In Multifamily Housing|url=http://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/uploads/A.Stein_PR_Disruptive_Development_-_Modular_Manufacturing_in_Multifamily_Housing.pdf|accessdate=10 September 2017|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to help the modules maintain their structural integrity as they are transported on trucks to the construction site; however, it is difficult to predict the final building strength since the modules need to endure transportation stresses that traditional homes never experience.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

The insulated concrete forms are modular units that are dry-stacked (without mortar) and filled with concrete. Insulating concrete forms has an acceptable ductility if used in high seismic risk zones.&lt;ref name=Asadi&gt;{{cite journal |last=Asadi |first=Pouria |date=March 2016 |title=Response modification factor due to ductility of screen-grid ICF wall system in high seismic risk zones |journal=KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering|issn=1226-7988 |doi=10.1007/s12205-016-0083-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When FEMA studied the destruction wrought by [[Hurricane Andrew]] in Dade County Florida, they concluded that modular and [[masonry]] homes fared best compared to other construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/library/viewRecord.do?id=2765|title=FIA 22, Mitigation Assessment Team Report: Hurricane Andrew in Florida (1993) |website=Fema.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===CE marking===
The [[CE mark]] is a construction norm that guarantees the user of mechanical resistance and strength of the structure. It is a label given by [[European community]] empowered authorities for end-to-end process mastering and traceability.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

All manufacturing operations are being monitored and recorded:
* Suppliers have to be known and certified,
* Raw materials and goods being sourced are to be recorded by batch used,
* Elementary products are recorded and their quality is monitored,
* Assembly quality is managed and assessed on a step by step basis,
* When a modular unit is finished, a whole set of tests are performed and if quality standards are met, a unique number and EC stamp is attached to and on the unit.

This ID and all the details are recorded in a [[database]], At any time, the producer has to be able to answer and provide all the information from each step of the production of a single unit, The EC certification guaranties standards in terms of durability, resistance against wind and earthquakes.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

===Surfaces and finishes===
Modular buildings can be assembled on top of multiple foundation surfaces, such as a crawl space, stilts (for areas that are prone to flooding), full [[basement]]s or standard slab at grade. They can also be built to multi-story heights. [[Motels]] and other multi-family structures have been built using modular construction techniques. The height to which a modular structure can be built depends on jurisdiction, but a number of countries, especially in Asia, allow them to be built to 24 floors or more.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

Exterior wall surfaces can be finalized in the plant production process or in the case of brick/stone veneers, field applications may be the builders' choice. Roof systems also can be applied in the field after the basic installation is completed.

===U.S. regional differences with modular construction===
Weather, population density, geographical distances, and local housing architecture play a role in the use of modular construction for home building. Because modular construction is so adaptable, it has begun to permeate every region of the U.S.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====Northeast====
The northeast is populated with factories that can combine modular housing design with other construction methods such as panelization and [[structural insulated panel|SIP]]s. Modules are typically limited to 16' width and up to 70' lengths because of the narrow road structure and densely populated areas of the region.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Other limitations are placed on transportation to locations such as Connecticut, Cape Cod, and Long Island.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====Mid-Atlantic====
The Mid-Atlantic region is similar to the northeast, in terms of building design and transport restriction to modules to a width of not more than 16'.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====Southeast====

Manufacturers in the Southeast often limit their ability to customize homes and focus on very traditional single story floor plans.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Much of the south is in coastal and high wind areas; modular construction may prove appealing in this area as it is already inherently stronger as it must be built for transport and craned installation, therefore offering wind resistance as good or higher than site-built construction.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====Central Plains====
The central plains states typically are made up of farming and rural communities. Ranch homes are the mainstay of the region. Prone to strong storms and tornado conditions, modular construction offers the ability to better withstand these storm patterns than its site built counterpart.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} The inter-module attachments that must be made when assembling a modular home on a foundation offer an inherently stronger home than site built construction can offer.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Interior finishes on both the walls and ceilings are typically textured. Corners on interior walls are typically rounded and finish trim around windows is optional. Because of the wider road and lower population density, modules can be as wide as 20' and as long as 90'. The ability to provide larger modules reduces the amount of modules needed to complete a home.

====Rockies====
Home design in this area ranges from Chalet style homes to log cabin style homes. Manufacturers in the region therefore provide a number of styles of homes. Capability varies from factory to factory as well as the ability to do complete customization of floor plans. Transportation is limited mostly to 16' wide modules to travel the roads of the area.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

====West Coast====
The high cost of living in coastal areas, and especially California, may provide modular construction an edge due to its lower cost.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Extreme building regulation and environmental requirements can delay the start of residential construction.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}} Several factories specialize in environmentally responsible construction by following green construction standards and offering zero energy homes.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

Living in coastal areas also mean that the modular home structure should be strong enough to withstand winds with high velocity. Modular homes, built correctly, have such kind of resistance to stand high wind velocity without any damage issues.{{Citation needed|date = September 2013|reason = Requires reliable, third-party, published source (not from a Modular Homes company's website) to allow for verification of statements.}}

== Open modular building==
{{See also|Green building}}
Modular building can also be [[open hardware|open source]] and green.

[[3D printing]] can be used to build the house.

The main standard is [[OpenStructures]] and its derivative [[Autarkytecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://m.z33.be/en/artworks/thomas-lommee-christiane-hoegner-autarkytecture |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231104727/http://m.z33.be/en/artworks/thomas-lommee-christiane-hoegner-autarkytecture |archive-date=2014-12-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key markets ==
Permanent modular buildings can be utilized in any application where stick-built construction is used. The primary markets served are K-12 education, higher education student housing, office and administrative space, retail and hospitality, healthcare, and publicly funded facilities.

== Research and development ==
Modular construction is the subject of continued research and development worldwide as the technology is applied to taller and taller buildings. Research and development is carried out by modular building companies and also research institutes such as the Modular Building Institute &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modular.org/|title=Modular Building Institute|author=|date=|website=Modular.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Steel Construction Institute,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steel-sci.com/|title=The Steel Construction Institute (SCI) UK Global Steel Expertise|author=|date=|website=Steel-sci.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a recent research project is MODCONS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modcons-research.eu/|title=MODCONS website|author=|date=|website=Modcons-research.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2637">'''Moment-resisting frame''' is a rectilinear assemblage of beams and columns, with the beams rigidly connected to the columns.

Resistance to lateral forces is provided primarily by [[rigid frame]] action – that is, by the development of [[bending moment]] and [[shear force]] in the frame members and joints.  By virtue of the rigid beam–column connections, a moment frame cannot displace laterally without bending the beams or columns depending on the geometry of the connection.  The bending rigidity and strength of the frame members is therefore the primary source of lateral stiffness and strength for the entire frame.&lt;ref&gt;Bruneau, Michel. et al., (2011). ''Ductile Design of Steel Structures''. McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-07-162395-7}}.page 347&lt;/ref&gt;

These connections between beams and columns, are formed through the use of rigid moment connections. A Moment Connection is a joint that allows the transfer of bending moment forces between a column and beam (or any other two members).&lt;ref&gt;[https://skyciv.com/structural-software/connection-design/moment-connections/ Moment Connections]&lt;/ref&gt; This is different to shear or pinned connections that prevent a moment-resisting frame to occur. An examples of this is pinned truss structures.

The [[1994 Northridge earthquake]] revealed a common flaw in steel-frame construction — poorly welded moment connections — and building codes were revised to strengthen them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usgs.gov/news/20-years-after-northridge-quake-buildings-remain-vulnerable "20 Years After Northridge Quake, Buildings Remain Vulnerable."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

Steel moment-resisting frames have been in use for more than one hundred years, dating to the earliest use of structural steel in building construction.  Steel building construction with the frame carrying the vertical loads initiated with the [[Home Insurance Building]] in Chicago, a 10-story structure constructed in 1884 with a height of 138&amp;nbsp;ft, often credited with being the first skyscraper.  This and other tall buildings in Chicago spawned an entire generation of tall buildings, constructed with load bearing steel frames supporting concrete floors and non-load bearing, unreinforced masonry [[infill wall]]s at their perimeters. Framing in these early structures typically utilized "H" shapes built up from plates, and "L" and "Z" sections.&lt;ref&gt;Hamburger, Ron. et al., (2009). ''Seismic Design of Steel Structures''. National Institute of Standards and Technology . NIST GCR 09-917-3.page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Institute for Environmental Studies''' (''NIES'':国立環境研究所, Kokuritsu-Kankyō kenkyūsho) was established in 1974 as a focal point for environmental research in Japan. In 2001 it became an [[Independent Administrative Institution]]. 
NIES is organised into eight centers, each of which is subdivided into a further number of sections responsible for different specializations within the broader field to which they belong.
The eight centers are responsible for research in eight different fields, with programs dedicated to these research areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nies.go.jp/fields/index-e.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7858">{{canon law}}
A '''notary in the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]]''' of the [[Catholic Church]] ([[ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]]: ''notarius'') is a person appointed by competent authority to draw up official or authentic documents. These documents are issued chiefly from the official administrative bureaux, the chanceries; secondly, from tribunals; lastly, others are drawn up at the request of individuals to authenticate their contracts or other acts. The public officials appointed to draw up these three classes of papers have been usually called notaries.

==Etymology==
Etymologically, a notary is one who takes notes. Notes are signs or cursory abbreviations to record the words uttered, so that they may be reproduced later in ordinary writing. Notaries were at first private secretaries, attached to the service of persons in positions of importance. It was natural for the science of notes to be in high esteem among those employed in recording the transactions of public boards, and for the name notary to be applied to these officials; so that before long the word was used to signify their occupation.

==History==
{{see also|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
The title and office existed at the Imperial Court (cf. Cod. Theod., VI, 16, "De primicerio et notariis"), whence they passed into all the royal chanceries, though in the course of time the term notary ceased to be used. This was the case also with the chanceries of the pope, the great episcopal sees, and even every bishopric.

There are grounds for doubting whether the seven regional notaries of the Roman Church, one for each ecclesiastical district of the Holy City, were instituted by St. Clement and appointed by him to record the Acts of the martyrs, as is said in the "Liber Pontificalis";&lt;ref&gt;"Vita Clementis", ed. Duchesne, I, 123&lt;/ref&gt; they date back, however, to an early age.

==''Primicerius'' and ''secundicerius''==
Not only were there notaries as soon as a bureau for ecclesiastical documents was established, but in very ancient days we find these notaries forming a kind of college presided over by a ''primicerius''; the notice of [[Pope Julius I]] in the "Liber Pontificalis" relates that this pope ordered an account of the property of the Church, intended as an authentic document, to be drawn up before the ''primicerius'' of the notaries.

The notaries were in the ranks of the clergy and must have received one of the minor orders; for the notariate is an office and not an order. At intervals the popes entrusted the notaries of their ''curia'' with various missions. Their chief, the ''primicerius'', with whom a ''secundicerius'' is sometimes found later, was a very important personage, in fact, the head of the [[Apostolic Chancery|pontifical chancery]]; during the vacancy of the papal chair, he formed part of the interim Government, and a letter in 640 (Jaffé, "Regesta", n. 2040) is signed (the pope being elected but not yet consecrated) by one "Joannes primicerius et servans locum s. sedis apostolicae".

==Protonotary Apostolic==
{{main|Protonotary Apostolic}}
There were of course many notaries in the service of the pontifical chancery; the seven regional notaries preserved a certain pre-eminence over the others and became the protonotary (also spelled "prothonotaries"), whose name and office continued. The ordinary notaries of the chancery, however, were gradually known by other names, according to their various functions, so that the term ceased to be employed in the pontifical and other chanceries. The prothonotaries were and still are a college of prelates, enjoying numerous privileges; they are known as "participants", but outside of Rome there are many purely honorary prothonotaries. The official duties had insensibly almost ceased; but Pius X in his reorganization of the Roman Curia has appointed participant prothonotaries to the chancery (Const. "Sapienti", 29 June 1908). A corresponding change occurred in the bureaux of the episcopal churches, abbeys, etc.; the officials attached to the chancery have ceased to be known as notaries and are called chancellor, secretary, etc. Lastly, mention must be made of the notaries of the synodal or conciliar assemblies, whose duties are limited to the duration of the assembly.

==Notaries of canonical tribunals==
Society in former times did not recognize the separation of powers; so, too, in the Church the judicial authority was vested in the same prelates as the administrative. Soon, however, contentious matters were tried separately before a specially appointed body.

The courts required a staff to record the transactions; these clerks were likewise notaries. In most civil courts they are, however, called registrars, clerks of the court, etc., but in the ecclesiastical tribunals they retain the name notary, though they are also called '''"actuaries"'''.

Thus the special law of the higher [[ecclesiastical tribunals]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;can. v and xxxv&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tribunal of the Roman Rota]] and the [[Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura]], reorganized by [[Pope Pius X|St. Pius X]], provides for the appointment of notaries for these two tribunals. The reason why the head official charged with drawing up the documents of the [[Holy Office]] is called the notary, as were the clerks who in former times drew up the records of the [[Inquisition]], is, doubtless, that of all the [[Roman Congregations]] the [[Holy Office]] is the only real judicial tribunal.

The notaries of ecclesiastical tribunals are usually clerics; the duties may however be confided to laymen, except in criminal cases against a cleric.

==Public notaries==
Finally, there is the class of persons to whom the term notary is restricted in common parlance, to wit, those who are appointed by the proper authorities to witness the documentary proceedings between private persons and to impress them with legal authenticity. They are not engaged in the chanceries, in order that they may be within easy reach of private individuals; they have a public character, so that their records, drawn up according to rule, are received as authentic accounts of the particular transaction, especially agreements, contracts, testaments, and wills.

Consequently, public notaries may be appointed only by those authorities who possess jurisdiction ''in foro externo'', and have a chancery, e.g. popes, bishops, emperors, reigning princes, and of course only within the limits of their jurisdiction; moreover, the territory within which a notary can lawfully exercise his functions is expressly determined. There were formerly Apostolic notaries and even episcopal notaries, duly commissioned by papal or episcopal letters, whose duty it was to receive documents relating to ecclesiastical or mixed affairs, especially in connection with benefices, foundations, and donations in favor of churches, wills of clerics, etc. They no longer exist; the only ecclesiastical notaries at present are the officials of the Roman and episcopal ''curiae''. Moreover, these notaries were layman, and [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] forbids clerics to acts as scriveners.&lt;ref group=note&gt;c. viii, "Ne clerici vel monachi", 1.

'''Protoscholastic writing''' re-introduced [[Space (punctuation)|space]] between words into the punctuation of western languages. It replaced [[Liturgy|liturgical]] models starting in the 7th century and by the 14th century it was the standard. The protoscholastic mode of writing was primarily introduced for faster decoding of written texts for scholars, rather than for oral communication (the focus of liturgical models).&lt;ref&gt;Saenger, Paul Henry.

In [[biology]], '''robustness''' is used to describe a species with a [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] based on strength and a heavy build. The alternative morphology is the [[Gracility|gracile]] body type. 

For example, comparing similar species, [[rat]]s have robust body types while [[Mouse|mice]] are gracile. Male and female members of the same species may display [[sexual dimorphism]] and have robust and gracile morphologies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} 

The terms "robust" vs. "gracile" are used relatively in the context of [[human evolution]], to distinguish:
*"robust" vs. "gracile" [[australopithecines]], see ''[[Paranthropus]]''
*"robust" [[archaic humans]] vs. "gracile" [[anatomically modern humans]]
*"robust" [[early modern humans]]  ([[Cro-Magnon]]) vs. "gracile" [[Epipaleolithic]] humans ([[Combe-Capelle]])

'''Sentientism''' is an ethical philosophy that grants degrees of moral consideration to all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings.&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Linzey|first1=A|title=Sentientism|journal=Encyclopedia of Animal Rights and Animal Welfare|date=1998|page=311|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/LINS-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sentientism extends [[humanism]] by showing compassion for non-human animals as well as potential artificial and alien intelligences.  In common with humanism, sentientism rejects supernatural beliefs in favour of critical, evidence-based thinking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Woodhouse |first1=Jamie |title=Humanism needs an upgrade |url=https://areomagazine.com/2018/10/07/humanism-needs-an-upgrade-the-philosophy-that-could-save-the-world/ |website=Areo |accessdate=21 November 2018|date=2018-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Sentientism proposes that sentience, the ability to experience suffering or flourishing, should determine whether we grant moral consideration to an entity&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Sentientism|journal=The Great Ape Project|pages=220–222|date=1993|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/RYDS}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Non-sentient entities do not warrant direct moral consideration because they can not experience the implications of our decisions.

Sentientist thinking has a long history, from [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s [[An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book
|last = Bentham
|first = Jeremy
|authorlink = 
|title = An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation
|publisher = Methuen
|series =  
|year = 1780
|doi = 
|isbn = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; through to contemporary philosophers such as [[Richard D. Ryder]] and [[Peter Singer]].

Sentientism differs from [[Speciesism]] in that it uses degrees of sentience, rather than species boundaries, to grant degrees of moral consideration.

Sentientism differs from [[painism]]&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite journal|last1=Ryder|first1=Richard D.|title=Painism versus utilitarianism|journal=Think|date=2009|volume=8|issue=21|page=85|doi=10.1017/S1477175608000420|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/think/article/painism-versus-utilitarianism/8C7F06412FC4DC9305BAA3D6E5871109}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that it acknowledges the full range of experience, not just that of pain, in warranting moral consideration. 

Sentientism agrees with [[Animalism (philosophy)|Animalism]] that humans are animals so both warrant moral consideration. However, sentientism argues that non-animal sentient beings, such as potential artificial or alien intelligences, would also warrant moral consideration.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2007}}

In electronics, '''signal conditioning''' means manipulating an [[analog signal]] in such a way that it meets the requirements of the next stage for further processing. Most common use is in [[analog-to-digital converter]]s.

In [[control engineering]] applications, it is common to have a sensing stage (which consists of a [[sensor]]), a signal conditioning stage (where usually amplification of the signal is done) and a processing stage (normally carried out by an [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]] and a [[micro-controller]]). [[Operational amplifiers]] (op-amps) are commonly employed to carry out the amplification of the signal in the signal conditioning stage.In some transducers this feature will come inherent for eg in hall effect sensors.

In Power Electronics before processing the input sensed signals by sensors like voltage sensor and current sensor those are scaled down to level of microprocessor by using the signal condition card.

==Inputs==
Signal inputs accepted by signal conditioners include [[direct current|DC voltage]] and current, [[alternating current|AC voltage]] and current, [[frequency]] and [[electric charge]].  Sensor inputs can be [[accelerometer]], [[thermocouple]], [[thermistor]], [[resistance thermometer]], [[strain gauge]] or bridge, and [[Linear variable differential transformer|LVDT]] or [[Rotary variable differential transformer|RVDT]].  Specialized inputs include encoder, counter or [[tachometer]], timer or clock, relay or switch, and other specialized inputs.  Outputs for signal conditioning equipment can be voltage, current, frequency, timer or counter, relay, resistance or potentiometer, and other specialized outputs.

==Signal conditioning processes==
Signal conditioning can include [[Amplifier|amplification]], [[filter (signal processing)|filtering]], converting, range matching, isolation and any other processes required to make sensor output suitable for processing after conditioning.

=== Filtering ===
[[Electronic filter|Filtering]] is the most common signal conditioning function, as usually not all the signal frequency spectrum contains valid data. The common example is 50/60&amp;nbsp;Hz AC power lines, present in most environments, which cause noise if amplified.

=== Amplifying ===

Signal [[Amplifier|amplification]] performs two important functions: increases the resolution of the input signal, and increases its signal-to-noise ratio. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  For example, the output of an electronic [[temperature sensor]], which is probably in the millivolts range is probably too low for an [[analog-to-digital converter]] (ADC) to process directly.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In this case it is necessary to bring the voltage level up to that required by the [[Analog-to-digital converter|ADC]].

Commonly used amplifiers used for signal conditioning include [[sample and hold]] amplifiers, peak detectors, log amplifiers, antilog amplifiers, instrumentation amplifiers and programmable gain amplifiers.&lt;ref&gt;"Data acquisition techniques using PCs." Academic-Press - Pages 44-47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excitation===
External power is required for the operation of an active sensor. (E.g. a temperature sensor like a
thermistor &amp; RTD, a pressure sensor(piezo-resistive and capacitive), etc.).
The stability and precision of the excitation signal directly relates to the sensor accuracy and
stability.

===Linearization===
Linearization is necessary when sensors produce voltage signals that are not linearly related to the physical measurement. Linearization is the process of interpreting the signal from the sensor and can be done either with signal conditioning or through software.

===Electrical Isolation===
Signal isolation may be used to pass the signal from the source to the measuring device without a physical connection. It is often used to isolate possible sources of signal perturbations that could otherwise follow the electrical path from the sensor to the processing circuitry. In some situations, it may be important to isolate the potentially expensive equipment used to process the signal after conditioning from the sensor.

Magnetic or optical isolation can be used. Magnetic isolation transforms the signal from a voltage to a magnetic field so the signal can be transmitted without physical connection (for example, using a transformer). Optical isolation works by using an electronic signal to modulate a signal encoded by light transmission (optical encoding). The decoded light transmission is then used for input for the next stage of processing.


Attenuation, the opposite of amplification, is necessary when voltages to be digitized are beyond the ADC range. This form of signal conditioning decreases the input signal amplitude so that the conditioned signal is within ADC range. Attenuation is typically necessary when measuring voltages that are more than 10 V.

According to [[Robin Williams (academic)|Robin A. Williams]] and David Edge (1996), "Central to '''social shaping of technology''' ('''SST''') is the concept that there are choices (though not necessarily conscious choices) inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems, and in the direction or trajectory of innovation programs."

If technology does not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant, then innovation is a 'garden of forking paths'. Different routes are available, potentially leading to different technological outcomes. Significantly, these choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups.

SST is one of the models of the technology: society relationship which emerged in the 1980s with MacKenzie and Wajcman's influential 1985 collection, alongside Pinch and Bijker's  [[social construction of technology]] framework and Callon and Latour's [[actor-network theory]]. These have a common feature of criticism of the [[linear model of innovation]] and  [[technological determinism]].  It differs from these notably in the attention it pays to the influence of the social and technological context of development which shapes innovation choices. SST is concerned to explore the material consequences of different technical choices, but criticizes technological determinism, which argues that technology follows its own developmental path, outside of human influences, and in turn, influences society. In this way, social shaping theorists conceive the relationship between technology and society as one of '[[Mutual Shaping|mutual shaping]]'.

Some versions of this theory state that technology affects society by affordances, constraints, preconditions, and unintended consequences (Baym, 2015). Affordance is the idea that technology makes specific tasks easier in our lives, while constraints make tasks harder to complete. The preconditions of technology are the skills and resources  that are vital to using the technology to its fullest potential. Finally, the unintended consequences of technology are unanticipated effects and impact of technology. The cell phone is an example of social shaping of technology (Zulto 2009). The cell phone has evolved over the years to make our lives easier by providing people with handheld computers that can answer calls, answer emails, search for information, and complete numerous other tasks (Zulto, 2009). Yet it has constraints for those that are not technologically savvy, hindering many people in society who do not understand how to utilize these devices. There are preconditions, such as monthly bills and access to electricity. There are also many unintended consequences such as the unintended distraction they cause for many people.

Not only does technology affect society, but according to SST, society affects technology by way of economics, politics, and culture (Baym, 2015). For instance, cell phones have spread in poor countries due to cell phones being more affordable than a computer and internet service (economics), government regulations which have made it fairly easy for cell phone providers to build networks (politics), and the small size of cell phones which fit easily into many cultures’ need for mobile communication (culture).

'''[[Textile]] manufacturing''' is a major [[Textile industry|industry]]. It is based on the conversion of [[fiber]] into [[yarn]], yarn into [[fabric]]. These are then [[Dyeing|dyed]] or printed, fabricated into [[clothing|clothes]]. Different types of fibers are used to produce yarn. [[Cotton]] remains the most important natural fiber, so is treated in depth. There are many variable processes available at the [[Spinning (textiles)|spinning]] and fabric-forming stages coupled with the complexities of the [[Finishing (textiles)|finishing]] and colouration processes to the production of a wide ranges of products. There remains a large industry that uses [[Textile manufacturing by pre-industrial methods|hand techniques]] to achieve the same results.

==Processing of cotton==
{{Cotton processing flowchart}}
Cotton is the world's most important natural fibre. In the year 2007, the global yield was 25 million tons from 35 million hectares cultivated in more than 50 countries.&lt;ref name="Majeed"/&gt;

There are six stages:&lt;ref name="Processes"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/industry/machproc.php |title=Machine processes|work=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council: Libraries|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultivating and harvesting===
[[Gossypium|Cotton]] is grown anywhere with long, hot dry summers with plenty of sunshine and low humidity. Indian cotton, gossypium arboreum, is finer but the staple is only suitable for hand processing. American cotton, gossypium hirsutum, produces the longer staple needed for machine production.&lt;ref name="CRT"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.craftrevival.org/voiceDetails.asp?Code=25|title= Handicrafts India.|publisher=Craft Revival Trust,|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Planting is from September to mid November and the crop is harvested between March and June. The [[cotton|cotton bolls]] are harvested by stripper harvesters and spindle pickers, that remove the entire boll from the plant. The cotton boll is the seed pod of the cotton plant, attached to each of the thousands of seeds are fibres about 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm long.&lt;ref name="Cultivating"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=64&amp;sub=machproc&amp;theme=industry&amp;crumb=Cultivation+%26amp%3B+harvesting |title=Cultivating and Harvesting|work=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council: Libraries|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Ginning'''
::The seed cotton goes into a [[Cotton gin]]. The cotton gin separates seeds and removes the "trash" (dirt, stems and leaves) from the fibre. In a saw gin, circular saws grab the fibre and pull it through a grating that is too narrow for the seeds to pass. A roller gin is used with longer staple cotton. Here a leather roller captures the cotton. A knife blade, set close to the roller, detaches the seeds by drawing them through teeth in circular saws and revolving brushes which clean them away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:: The ginned cotton fibre, known as lint, is then compressed into bales which are about 1.5 m tall and weigh almost 220 kg. Only 33% of the crop is usable lint. Commercial cotton is priced by quality, and that broadly relates to the average length of the staple, and the variety of the plant. Longer staple cotton (2½ in to 1¼ in) is called Egyptian, medium staple (1¼ in to ¾ in) is called American upland and short staple (less than ¾ in) is called Indian.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 p=13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::The cotton seed is pressed into a cooking oil. The husks and meal are processed into animal feed, and the stems into paper.

*'''Opening and cleaning'''
[[File:Catalonia Terrassa mNATEC Batuar 1885.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|Platt Bros. Picker]]
::[[Cotton mill]]s get the cotton shipped to them in large, 500 pound bales. When the cotton comes out of a bale, it is all packed together and still contains vegetable matter. The bale is broken open using a machine with large spikes. It is called an '''Opener'''. In order to fluff up the cotton and remove the vegetable matter, the cotton is sent through a picker, or similar machines. The cotton is fed into a machine known as a '''picker''', and gets beaten with a beater bar in order to loosen it up. It is fed through various rollers, which serve to remove the vegetable matter. The cotton, aided by fans, then collects on a screen and gets fed through more rollers till it emerges as a continuous soft fleecy sheet, known as a lap.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 p=13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Preparatory"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=65&amp;sub=machproc&amp;theme=industry&amp;crumb=Preparatory+processes |title=Preparatory Processes|work=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council: Libraries|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::Mixing and [[Scutching]]
Scutching refers to the process of cleaning cotton of its seeds and other impurities. The first scutching machine was invented in 1797, but did not come into further mainstream use until after 1808 or 1809, when it was introduced and used in Manchester, England. By 1816, it had become generally adopted. The scutching machine worked by passing the cotton through a pair of rollers, and then striking it with iron or steel bars called beater bars or beaters. The beaters, which turn very quickly, strike the cotton hard and knock the seeds out. This process is done over a series of parallel bars so as to allow the seeds to fall through. At the same time, air is blown across the bars, which carries the cotton into a cotton chamber.

*'''Carding'''

[[File:Catalonia Terrassa mNATEC Pentinadora.jpg|thumb|200px|A Combing machine]] 
:Carding: the fibres are separated and then assembled into a loose strand (sliver or tow) at the conclusion of this stage.
::The cotton comes off of the picking machine in laps, and is then taken to carding machines. The carders line up the fibres nicely to make them easier to spin. The carding machine consists mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it. All of the rollers are covered in small teeth, and as the cotton progresses further on the teeth get finer (i.e. closer together). The cotton leaves the carding machine in the form of a sliver; a large rope of fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=66,67}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Note: In a wider sense Carding can refer to these four processes: Willowing- loosening the fibres; Lapping- removing the dust to create a flat sheet or lap of cotton; Carding- combing the tangled lap into a thick rope of 1/2 inch in diameter, a sliver; and Drawing- where a drawing frame combines 4 slivers into one- repeated for increased quality.
*'''Combing''' is optional, but is used to remove the shorter fibres, creating a stronger yarn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Drawing''' the fibres are straightened
::Several slivers are combined. Each sliver will have thin and thick spots, and by combining several slivers together a more consistent size can be reached. Since combining several slivers produces a very thick rope of cotton fibres, directly after being combined the slivers are separated into rovings. These rovings (or slubbings) are then what are used in the spinning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::Generally speaking, for machine processing, a roving is about the width of a pencil.
::*Drawing frame: Draws the strand out
::*Slubbing Frame: adds twist, and winds onto bobbins
::*Intermediate Frames: are used to repeat the slubbing process to produce a finer yarn.
::*Roving frames: reduces to a finer thread, gives more twist, makes more regular and even in thickness, and winds onto a smaller tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinning - yarn manufacture===
{{Main|Cotton-spinning machinery}}
*'''[[Spinning (textiles)|Spinning]]'''
::Most spinning today is done using [[Open end spinning|Break or Open-end spinning]], this is a technique where the staples are blown by air into a rotating drum, where they attach themselves to the tail of formed yarn that is continually being drawn out of the chamber. Other methods of break spinning use needles and [[electrostatic]] forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method has replaced the older methods of ring and mule spinning. It is also easily adapted for [[Synthetic fiber|artificial fibres]].
::The spinning machines takes the roving, thins it and twists it, creating yarn which it winds onto a bobbin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::In [[Spinning mule|mule spinning]] the roving is pulled off a bobbin and fed through some rollers, which are feeding at several different speeds. This thins the roving at a consistent rate. If the roving was not a consistent size, then this step could cause a break in the yarn, or could jam the machine. The yarn is twisted through the spinning of the bobbin as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cylinder called a spindle, which then produces a cone-shaped bundle of fibres known as a "cop", as the carriage returns. Mule spinning produces a finer thread than the less skilled [[ring spinning]].&lt;ref name="RingMule"&gt;{{Citation|last=Saxonhouse|first=Gary|title=Technological Evolution in Cotton Spinning, 1878-1933|url=http://www.textile-technology.com/SST_Seminars/Jeremy.pdf|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=2009-01-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716213233/http://www.textile-technology.com/SST_Seminars/Jeremy.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::*The mule was an intermittent process, as the frame advanced and returned a distance of 5ft.It was the descendant of 1779 Crompton device. It produces a softer less twisted thread that was favoured for fines and for weft.
::*The ring was a descendant of the Arkwright water Frame 1769. It was a continuous process, the yarn was coarser, had a greater twist and was stronger so was suited to be warp. Ring spinning is slow due to the distance the thread must pass around the ring, other methods have been introduced.
::Sewing thread, was made of several threads twisted together, or doubled.

*'''Checking'''
::This is the process where each of the bobbins is rewound to give a tighter bobbin.
*'''Folding and twisting'''
::Plying is done by pulling yarn from two or more bobbins and twisting it together, in the opposite direction that in which it was spun. Depending on the weight desired, the cotton may or may not be plied, and the number of strands twisted together varies.&lt;ref name="Spinning"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=66&amp;sub=machproc&amp;theme=industry&amp;crumb=Spinning |title=Spinning|work=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council: Libraries|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Gassing'''
{{Main|Singe#Textiles|Gassing (textile process)}}
::&lt;!-- Not certain where this process should go --&gt; Gassing is the process of passing yarn, as distinct from fabric very rapidly through a series of Bunsen gas flames in a gassing frame, in order to burn off the projecting fibres and make the thread round and smooth and also brighter. Only the better qualities of yarn are gassed, such as that used for voiles, poplins, venetians, gabardines, many Egyptian qualities, etc. There is a loss of weight in gassing, which varies' about 5 to 8 per cent., so that if a 2/60's yarn is required 2/56's would be used. The gassed yarn is darker in shade afterwards, but should not be scorched.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|1921|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measurements====
{{main|Units of textile measurement}}
*Cotton Counts: Refers to the thickness of the cotton yarn where 840 yards of yarns weighs {{convert|1|lb|kg}}. 10 count cotton means that {{convert|8400|yd|m}} of yarn weighs {{convert|1|lb|kg}}. This is coarser than 40 count cotton where 40x840 yards are needed. In the United Kingdom, Counts to 40s are coarse (Oldham Counts), 40 to 80s are medium counts and above 80 is a fine count. In the United States ones to 20s are coarse counts.
*Hank: A length of 7 leas or 840 yards (the worsted hank is only 560 yd&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Thread: A length of 54 in (the circumference of a warp beam)
*Bundle: Usually 10&amp;nbsp;lb
*Lea: A length of 80 threads or 120 yards&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Curtis|1921|p=Cotton count}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Denier: this is an alternative method. It is defined as a number that is equivalent to the weight in grams of 9000m of a single yarn. 15 denier is finer than 30 denier.
*Tex: is the weight in grams of 1&amp;nbsp;km of yarn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weaving-fabric manufacture===
The weaving process uses a [[loom]]. The lengthway threads are known as the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]], and the cross way threads are known as the [[weft]]. The warp, which must be strong, needs to be presented to loom on a warp beam. The weft passes across the loom in a [[Shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]], that carries the yarn on a [[pirn]]. These pirns are automatically changed by the loom. Thus, the yarn needs to be wrapped onto a beam, and onto pirns before weaving can commence.&lt;ref name="Weaving"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=66&amp;sub=machproc&amp;theme=industry&amp;crumb=Weaving |title=Weaving|work=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council: Libraries|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Winding'''
::After being spun and plied, the cotton thread is taken to a warping room where the winding machine takes the required length of yarn and winds it onto warpers bobbins
*'''Warping or beaming'''
[[File:Catalonia Terrassa mNATEC Ordidor.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|A Warper]]
::Racks of bobbins are set up to hold the thread while it is rolled onto the warp bar of a loom. Because the thread is fine, often three of these would be combined to get the desired thread count.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}
*'''[[Sizing#Textile warp sizing|Sizing]]'''
::Slasher sizing machine needed for strengthening the warp by adding starch to reduce breakage of the yarns.
*'''Drawing in, Looming'''
::The process of drawing each end of the warp separately through the dents of the [[reed (weaving)|reed]] and the eyes of the healds, in the order indicated by the draft.&lt;!--The drawing-in of the warp threads through the eyes of the healds on the principle that every end that works alike may be drawn on the same shaft. Sometimes the least possible number of shafts is not an advantage. The number of heald shafts required is shown by the draft as every end that lifts differently from others must be on its own shaft. Thus a 6-end twill requires 6 shafts, a 12-end, 12 shafts, and so on.--&gt;
*'''Pirning (Processing the weft)'''
::Pirn winding frame was used to transfer the weft from cheeses of yarn onto the pirns that would fit into the shuttle
*'''[[Weaving]]'''
{{main|Power loom}}
::At this point, the thread is woven. Depending on the era, one person could manage anywhere from 3 to 100 machines. In the mid nineteenth century, four was the standard number. A skilled weaver in 1925 would run 6 [[Lancashire Loom]]s. As time progressed new mechanisms were added that stopped the loom any time something went wrong. The mechanisms checked for such things as a broken warp thread, broken weft thread, the shuttle going straight across, and if the shuttle was empty. Forty of these [[Northrop Loom]]s or automatic looms could be operated by one skilled worker.&lt;ref name="Fowler"&gt;{{Citation|last=Fowler|first=Alan |title=Lancashire Cotton Operatives and Work, 1900-1950: A Social History of Lancashire Cotton Operatives in the Twentieth Century|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., |year=2003|pages=90|isbn=0-7546-0116-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7GHLv-rLifgC&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=21 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:::&lt;!--SHED-
The space between the two lines of warp threads caused by raising one portion and depressing the other. The mechanism employed for this raising and lowering, termed 'shedding motions’ are healds, tappets, dobbies, and jacquards. The shuttle passes through this space or shed and leaves a pick of weft behind which is beaten up by the [[reed (weaving)|reed]] and the shed changed for the next pick.--&gt;
[[File:Strickmaschine im Museum.JPG|thumb|200px|A Draper loom in textile museum, [[Lowell, Massachusetts]] ]]
:::The three primary movements of a loom are shedding, picking, and beating-up.
::::*''Shedding'': The operation of dividing the warp into two lines, so that the shuttle can pass between these lines. There are two general kinds of sheds-"open" and "closed." Open Shed-The warp threads are moved when the pattern requires it-from one line to the other. Closed Shed-The warp threads are all placed level in one line after each pick.
::::*''Picking'':The operation of projecting the shuttle from side to side of the loom through the division in the warp threads. This is done by the overpick or underpick motions. The overpick is suitable for quick-running looms, whereas the underpick is best for heavy or slow looms.
::::*''Beating-up'': The third primary movement of the loom when making cloth, and is the action of the [[reed (weaving)|reed]] as it drives each pick of weft to the fell of the cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Curtis|1921|p=Shed}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::: The [[Lancashire Loom]] was the first semi-automatic loom. [[Jacquard loom]]s and [[Dobby loom]]s are looms that have sophisticated methods of shedding. They may be separate looms, or mechanisms added to a plain loom. A [[Northrop Loom]] was fully automatic and was mass produced between 1909 and the mid-1960s. Modern looms run faster and do not use a shuttle: there are air jet looms, water jet looms and [[rapier looms]].&lt;br&gt;
====Measurements====
* Ends and Picks: Picks refer to the weft, ends refer to the warp. The coarseness of the cloth can be expressed as the [[Units of textile measurement#Picks per inch|number of picks]] and [[Units of textile measurement#Ends per inch|ends]] per quarter inch square, or per inch square. Ends is always written first. For example: ''Heavy domestics are made from coarse yarns, such as 10's to 14's warp and weft, and about 48 ends and 52 picks.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Curtis|1921|p=Ends}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Issues====
When a hand loom was located in the home, children helped with the weaving process from an early age. Piecing needs dexterity, and a child can be as productive as an adult. When weaving moves from the home to the mill, children are often allowed to ''help'' their older sisters, and laws have to be made to prevent [[child labor|child labour]] becoming established.

===Knitting — fabric manufacture===
[[File:Rundstrickmaschine Nadel scharf.jpg|left|thumb|A circular knitting machine.]]
[[File:Rundstrickmaschine Zungennadeln.jpg|thumb|Close-up on the needles.]]
{{main|Knitted fabric}}

[[Knitting]] by [[Knitting machine|machine]] is done in two different ways; warp and weft. Weft knitting (as seen in the pictures) is similar in method to hand knitting with stitches all connected to each other horizontally. Various weft machines can be configured to produce textiles from a single spool of [[yarn]] or multiple spools depending on the size of the machine cylinder (where the needles are bedded). In a [[warp knitting|warp knit]] there are many pieces of yarn and there are vertical chains, zigzagged together by crossing the cotton yarn.

Warp knits do not stretch as much as a weft knit, and it is run-resistant. A weft knit is not run-resistant, but stretches more. This is especially true if spools of [[spandex]] are processed from separate spool containers and interwoven through the cylinder with cotton yarn, giving the finished product more [[Spandex|flexibility]] and making it less prone to having a 'baggy' appearance. The average [[t-shirt]] is a weft knit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier 1970|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finishing — processing of textiles===
The woven cotton fabric in its loom-state not only contains impurities, including warp size, but requires further treatment in order to develop its full textile potential. Furthermore, it may receive considerable added value by applying one or more finishing processes.&lt;ref name="Finishing"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.spinningtheweb.org.uk/m_display.php?irn=68&amp;sub=machproc&amp;theme=industry&amp;crumb=Finishing|title=Finishing|work=Spinning the Web|publisher=Manchester City Council: Libraries|accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DG"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://website.lineone.net/~davghalgh/cotton_finishing.html|title=Cotton finishing|last=GREENHALGH|first=DAVID|year=2005|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::Depending on the size that has been used, the cloth may be steeped in a dilute acid and then rinsed, or enzymes may be used to break down the size.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 p=155"&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Scouring'''
::Scouring, is a chemical washing process carried out on cotton fabric to remove natural wax and non-fibrous impurities (e.g. the remains of seed fragments) from the fibres and any added soiling or dirt. Scouring is usually carried in iron vessels called [[Boiler|kier]]s. The fabric is boiled in an [[alkali]], which forms a soap with free fatty acids ([[saponification]]). A kier is usually enclosed, so the solution of [[sodium hydroxide]] can be boiled under pressure, excluding [[oxygen]] which would degrade the [[cellulose]] in the fibre. If the appropriate [[reagent]]s are used, scouring will also remove size from the fabric although desizing often precedes scouring and is considered to be a separate process known as fabric preparation. Preparation and scouring are prerequisites to most of the other finishing processes. At this stage even the most naturally white cotton fibres are yellowish, and bleaching, the next process, is required.&lt;ref name="Collier 1970 p=155"/&gt;

*'''Bleaching'''
{{Main|Textile bleaching}}
::Bleaching improves whiteness by removing natural coloration and remaining trace impurities from the cotton; the degree of bleaching necessary is determined by the required whiteness and absorbency. Cotton being a vegetable fibre will be bleached using an [[oxidizing agent]], such as dilute [[sodium hypochlorite]] or dilute [[hydrogen peroxide]]. If the fabric is to be dyed a deep shade, then lower levels of bleaching are acceptable, for example. However, for white bed sheetings and medical applications, the highest levels of whiteness and absorbency are essential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Mercerising'''
{{Main|Mercerized cotton}}
::A further possibility is mercerizing during which the fabric is treated with caustic soda solution to cause swelling of the fibres. This results in improved lustre, strength and dye affinity. Cotton is mercerized under tension, and all alkali must be washed out before the tension is released or [[Shrinkage (fabric)|shrinkage]] will take place. Mercerizing can take place directly on grey cloth, or after bleaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier|1970|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::Many other chemical treatments may be applied to cotton fabrics to produce low flammability, crease resist and other special effects but four important non-chemical finishing treatments are:

*'''Singeing'''
{{Main|Singe#Textiles}}
::Singeing is designed to burn off the surface fibres from the fabric to produce smoothness. The fabric passes over brushes to raise the fibres, then passes over a plate heated by gas flames.

*'''Raising'''
::Another finishing process is raising. During raising, the fabric surface is treated with sharp teeth to lift the surface fibres, thereby imparting hairiness, softness and warmth, as in flannelette.

*'''Calendering'''
{{Main|Calender}}
::Calendering is the third important mechanical process, in which the fabric is passed between heated rollers to generate smooth, polished or embossed effects depending on roller surface properties and relative speeds.

*'''Shrinking (Sanforizing)'''
{{Main|Sanforization}}
::Finally, mechanical shrinking (sometimes referred to as sanforizing), whereby the fabric is forced to shrink width and/or lengthwise, creates a fabric in which any residual tendency to shrink after subsequent laundering is minimal.

*'''Dyeing'''
{{Main|Dyeing}}
::Finally, cotton is an absorbent fibre which responds readily to colouration processes. Dyeing, for instance, is commonly carried out with an anionic direct dye by completely immersing the fabric (or yarn) in an aqueous dyebath according to a prescribed procedure. For improved fastness to washing, rubbing and light, other dyes such as vats and reactives are commonly used. These require more complex chemistry during processing and are thus more expensive to apply.

*'''Printing'''
{{Main|Textile printing}}
::Printing, on the other hand, is the application of colour in the form of a paste or ink to the surface of a fabric, in a predetermined pattern. It may be considered as localised dyeing. Printing designs onto already dyed fabric is also possible.

===Economic, environmental and political consequences of cotton manufacture===
Production of cotton requires [[arable land]].
In addition, cotton is farmed intensively and uses large amounts of fertilizer and 25% of the world's insecticides. Native Indian varieties of cotton were rainwater fed, but modern hybrids used for the mills need irrigation, which spreads pests. The 5% of cotton-bearing land in India uses 55% of all pesticides used in India.&lt;ref name="CRT"/&gt; In [[United Kingdom]] some companies design cloths for manufacturers such as Sewport,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sewport.co.uk/fashion-manufacturing-company-sewport/|title=Sewport Ltd London|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=Sewport Ltd London|access-date=2017-02-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624161035/http://www.sewport.co.uk/fashion-manufacturing-company-sewport/|archive-date=2015-06-24|dead-url=yes|work=|language=en-US|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bridge &amp; Stitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bridgeandstitch.com/|title=Bridge &amp; Stitch, Clothing Design and Manufacturer|last=|first=|date=|newspaper=Bridge &amp; Stitch|access-date=2017-02-17|work=|language=en-GB|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2014/sep/11/fashion-entrepreneurs-how-find-factory-make-products|title=Fashion entrepreneurs: How to find a factory to make your products|last=Lewis|first=Perri|date=2014-09-11|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-17|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consumption of energy in form of water and electricity is relatively high, especially in processes like washing, de-sizing, bleaching, rinsing, dyeing, printing, coating and finishing. Processing is time consuming. The major portion of water in textile industry is used for wet processing of textile (70 per cent). Approximately 25 per cent of energy in the total textile production like fibre production, spinning, twisting, weaving, knitting, clothing manufacturing etc. is used in dyeing. About 34 per cent of energy is consumed in spinning, 23 per cent in weaving, 38 per cent in chemical wet processing and five per cent in miscellaneous processes. Power dominates consumption pattern in spinning and weaving, while thermal energy is the major factor for chemical wet processing.&lt;ref name="Majeed"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.dawn.com/2009/01/19/ebr5.htm|title= Cotton and textiles — the challenges ahead|last=Majeed|first=A|date=January 19, 2009 |publisher=Dawn-the Internet edition|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton acts as a [[carbon sink]] as it contains [[Cellulose#Structure_and_properties|cellulose]] and this contains 44,44% carbon. However, due to carbon emissions from fertiliser application, use of mechanized tools to harvest the cotton, ... cotton manufacture tends to emit more CO² than what it stores in the form of cellulose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://awsassets.wwfindia.org/downloads/wwf___cotton_carbon_emission.pdf Cutting cotton carbon emissions -Findings from Warangal, India]&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of cotton is divided into two segments i.e. organic and [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]].&lt;ref name="Majeed"/&gt; Cotton crop provides livelihood to millions of people but its production is becoming expensive because of high water consumption, use of expensive pesticides, insecticides and fertiliser. Genetically modified products aim to increase disease resistance and reduce the water required. The organic sector was worth $583 million. Genetically modified cotton, in 2007, occupied 43% of cotton growing areas.&lt;ref name="CRT"/&gt;

Before mechanisation, cotton was harvested manually by farmers in India and by African slaves in America. In 2012 [[Uzbekistan]] was a major exporter of cotton and uses manual labour during the harvest. Human rights groups claim that health care professionals and children are forced to pick cotton.&lt;ref name=bbc-usbek-cotton&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-19931639 Doctors and nurses are forced to pick cotton]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Processing of other vegetable fibres==

===Flax===
{{main|Flax}}
Flax is a [[bast fibre]], which means it comes in bundles under the bark of the Linum usitatissimum plant. The plant flowers and is harvested.
:*[[Retting]]
:*Breaking
:*[[Scutching]]
:*[[Hackling]] or combing
It is now treated like cotton.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|1970|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jute===
{{main|Jute}}
Jute is a [[bast fibre]], which comes from the inner bark of the plants of the Corchorus genus. It is retted like flax, sundried and baled. When spinning a small amount of oil must be added to the fibre. It can be bleached and dyed. It was used for sacks and bags but is now used for the backing for carpets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|1970|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jute can be blended with other fibres to make composite fabrics and work continues in Bangladesh to refine the processes and extend the range of usage possible. In the 1970s, jute-cotton composite fabrics were known as ''jutton'' fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailystar.net/magazine/2003/10/01/coverstory.htm Daily Star Magazine] 1 October 2003, accessed 20 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hemp===
{{main|Hemp}}
Hemp is a [[bast fibre]] from the inner bark of Cannabis sativa. It is difficult to bleach, it is used for making cord and rope.
:*[[Retting]]
:*Separating
:*Pounding&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Collier|1970|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other bast fibres===
These bast fibres can also be used: [[kenaf]], [[urena]], [[ramie]], [[Urtica dioica|nettle]].

===Other leaf fibres===
[[Sisal]] is the main leaf fibre used; others are: [[abacá]] and [[henequen]].

==Processing of animal and insect fibres==

===Wool===
Wool comes from domesticated sheep. It forms two products, [[woolen]]s and [[worsted]]s. The sheep has two sorts of wool and it is the inner coat that is used. This can be mixed with wool that has been recovered from rags. [[Glossary of textile manufacturing|Shoddy]] is the term for recovered wool that is not matted, while [[Glossary of textile manufacturing|mungo]] comes from [[felt]]ed wool. Extract is recovered chemically from mixed cotton/wool fabrics.

The fleece is cut in one piece from the sheep.This is then skirted to remove the soiled wool, and baled. It is graded into long wool where the fibres can be up to 15 in, but anything over 2.5&amp;nbsp;inches is suitable for combing into worsteds. Fibres less than that form short wool and are described as clothing or carding wool.

At the mill the wool is scoured in a detergent to remove grease (the yolk) and impurities. This is done mechanically in the opening machine. Vegetable matter can be removed chemically using [[sulfuric acid|sulphuric acid]] (carbonising). Washing uses a solution of soap and [[sodium carbonate]]. The wool is oiled before carding or combing.
:*Woollens: Use noils from the worsted combs, mungo and shoddy and new short wool

:*Worsteds
:::[[Combing]]: Oiled slivers are wound into laps, and placed in the circular comber. The worsted yarn gathers together to form a top. The shorter fibres or noils remain behind and are removed with a knife.
:*[[Angora wool|Angora]]

===Silk===
The processes in [[silk]] production are similar to those of cotton but take account that reeled silk is a continuous fibre. The terms used are different.
*Opening bales. Assorting skeins: where silk is sorted by colour, size and quality, scouring: where the silk is washed in water of 40 degrees for 12 hours to remove the natural gum, drying: either by steam heating or centrifuge, softening: by rubbing to remove any remaining hard spots.
*Silk throwing (winding). The skeins are placed on a reel in a frame with many others. The silk is wound onto spools or bobbins.
:*Doubling and twisting. The silk is far too fine to be woven, so now it is doubled and twisted to make the warp, known as organzine and the weft, known as tram. In organzine each single is given a few twists per inch (tpi), and combine with several other singles counter twisted hard at 10 to 14 tpi. In tram the two singles are doubled with each other with a light twist, 3 to 6 tpi. Sewing thread is two tram threads, hard twisted, and machine-twist is made of three hard-twisted tram threads. Tram for the crepe process is twisted at up to 80 tpi to make it 'kick up'.
:*Stretching. The thread is tested for consistent size. Any uneven thickness is stretched out. The resulting thread is reeled into containing 500 yd to 2500 yd. The skeins are about 50 inches in loop length.
:*Dyeing: the skeins are scoured again, and discoloration removed with a sulphur process. This weakens the silk. The skeins are now tinted or dyed. They are dried and rewound onto bobbins, spools and skeins. Looming, and the weaving process on power looms is the same as with cotton.
*Weaving. The organzine is now warped. This is a similar process to in cotton. Firstly, thirty threads or so are wound onto a warping reel, and then using the warping reels, the threads are beamed. A thick layer of paper is laid between each layer on the beam to stop entangling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Silk manufacture|date=1900|url=http://www.oldandsold.com/articles04/textiles17.shtml|work=Antiques Digest: Lost Knowledge from the Past|publisher=Old and Sold|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental consequences of wool and silk manufacture===
Both wool and silk require [[farmland]]. Whereas silkworms require mulberry leaves, sheep eat grass, clover, forbs and other pasture plants. Sheep, like all ruminants emit CO2 via their digestive system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1113/expphysiol.1972.sp002136 MEASUREMENT OF CARBON DIOXIDE PRODUCTION IN SHEEP BY ISOTOPE DILUTION.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, their pastures may sometimes be fertilised&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/pasture-management/use-nitrogen-fertiliser-boost-winter-pasture-growth?page=0%2C2 Use of nitrogen fertiliser to boost winter pasture growth]&lt;/ref&gt; which further increases emissions.

==Processing of synthetic fibres==

===Discussion of types of synthetic fibers===
{{main|Synthetic fiber}}
'''Synthetic fibers''' are the result of extensive development by [[scientist]]s to improve upon the naturally occurring [[animal]] and plant fibers. In general, [[synthetic fiber]]s are created by forcing, or [[extrusion|extruding]], fiber forming materials through holes (called spinnerets) into the air, thus forming a thread. Before synthetic fibers were developed, [[cellulose fiber]]s were made from natural [[cellulose]], which comes from [[plant]]s.

The first artificial fiber, known as [[art silk]] from 1799 onwards, became known as [[viscose]] around 1894, and finally [[rayon]] in 1924. A similar product known as [[cellulose acetate]] was discovered in 1865. Rayon and acetate are both artificial fibers, but not truly synthetic, being made from [[wood]]. Although these artificial fibers were discovered in the mid-nineteenth century, successful modern manufacture began much later in the 1930s. [[Nylon]], the first synthetic fiber, made its debut in the [[United States]] as a replacement for [[silk]], and was used for [[parachute]]s and other [[military]] uses. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The techniques used to process these fibers in yarn are essentially the same as with natural fibers, modifications have to be made as these fibers are of great length, and have no texture such as the scales in cotton and wool that aid meshing.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

Unlike natural fibres, produced by plants, animals or insects, synthetic fibres are made from [[fossil fuel]]s, and thus require no farmland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actforlibraries.org/do-synthetic-fabrics-harm-the-environment-no/ Do Synthetic Fabrics Harm the Environment]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vinciane Despret''' is a Belgian [[philosopher of science]], associate professor, at the [[University of Liège]], [[Belgium]].

== Biography ==

Vinciane Despret first graduated in philosophy. She studied psychology and graduated in 1991. She is most known for having provided a reflexive account on [[ethologists]], observing babblers in the [[Negev]] desert and the way they would interpret those birds' complex dance moves.&lt;ref&gt;A short profile introduction is to be found on the website of her editor, "La Découverte", in Paris: http://www.editionsladecouverte.fr/catalogue/index-Les_faiseuses_d_histoires-9782359250473.html&lt;/ref&gt;

She is considered to be a foundational thinker in what has now became the field of [[animal studies]].&lt;ref&gt;For instance, this podcast of Despret interviewing the primatologist [[Thelma Rowell]] — http://backdoorbroadcasting.net/2011/06/vinciane-despret-experimenting-with-politics-and-happiness-through-sheep-cows-and-pigs/&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, at the heart of her work lies the question of the relationship between observers and the observed during the conduct of scientific research.

Despret affiliates herself to such critical thinkers in philosophy and anthropology of science as [[Isabelle Stengers]], [[Donna Haraway]] and [[Bruno Latour]]. She undertakes a critical understanding of how science is fabricated, following scientists doing fieldwork and the way they actively create links and specific relationships to their objects of study.

Although she has mostly published books in French, some of her works are planned to be published in English in the course of late 2012.
