'''''100 Great Paintings''''' is a British television series broadcast in 1980 on [[BBC Two|BBC 2]], devised by  [[Edwin Mullins]].&lt;ref name="i1"&gt;http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/series/11652 13 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He chose 20 thematic groups, such as war, the [[Adoration of the Magi|Adoration]], the language of color, the hunt, and bathing, picking five paintings from each.&lt;ref name="b3v"&gt;100 Meisterwerke, Vol. 3, Foreword&lt;/ref&gt; The selection ranges from 12th-century China through the 1950s, with an emphasis on European paintings.  He deliberately avoided especially famous paintings, such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' or [[John Constable]]'s ''[[The Haywain]]''.&lt;ref name="b1e"&gt;100 Meisterwerke, Vol. 1, Introduction of the Publisher&lt;/ref&gt;  The series is available on VHS or DVD.&lt;ref name="i2"&gt;http://www.films.com/id/2067/100_Great_Paintings.htm 13 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of the series, Mullins published the book ''Great Paintings: Fifty Masterpieces, Explored, Explained and Appreciated'' (1981), which contained about half of the theme groups.

== German television series ==

From 1980 through 1994, the German broadcaster [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] produced a television series called ''[[1000 Meisterwerke]]'' (originally named ''100 Meisterwerke aus den großen Museen der Welt''; "100 Masterworks from the Great Museums of the World"), which was broadcast by [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] and [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|BR]]. In each of the 10-minute broadcasts, a single painting was presented and analyzed by an art historian. The Sunday evening broadcasts had five million viewers.&lt;ref name="v7" /&gt;

== From 100 to 1000 ==
The Fine Arts Editor of WDR, Wibke von Bonin, developed the German version of the series. The series was produced by RM Arts, directed by [[Reiner E. Moritz]], and narrated by [[Rudolf Jürgen Bartsch]]&lt;ref name="v7" /&gt; and the distinctive title melody was composed by [[Wilhelm Dieter Siebert]]. &lt;!-- camera: Konrad Kotowski; editing: Elke Riemann, Cornelia Berger --&gt;

Each episode showed and discussed one painting, with other paintings of the artist and of other artists being drawn in for comparison.

The German or the English version of the series was shown in [[West Germany]], the USA, England, the Netherlands, South Africa, Austria, Scandinavia and Japan.&lt;ref name="b1v"&gt;100 Meisterwerke, Vol. 1, Foreword&lt;/ref&gt;

The German translation of Mullins' book appeared as ''100 Meisterwerke'' in 1983. In 1985, a second volume came out, only in Germany, which discussed the remaining 50 paintings (see section [[#Literature|Literature]]). The text in the books and the television series are largely the same.

After the end of the original series, it was continued under the title, ''1000 Meisterwerke'', only in Germany. The concept was changed, so that instead of theme groups, several pictures from the same museum were now grouped into a series of broadcasts. The emphasis was on German museums at first, and in addition, European museums and individual international museums were considered. Painters who had already appeared in "''100 Meisterwerken''" were not included at first. Many times, the authors of the episode were also the curators in charge of the painting.&lt;ref name="b3v" /&gt; Occasionally, the fixed framework of the series was deviated from, such as when several paintings were treated in a single broadcast in the "Greek cycle",&lt;ref name="b32" /&gt; or when the painter, [[Konrad Klapheck]], wrote the script about his own painting, but using the third person.&lt;ref name="b34" /&gt;

In 1986, Bonin received the [[Goldene Kamera]] award for her work&lt;ref name="v7" /&gt; and video cassettes on seven German museums were produced (see section [[#Literature|Literature]]).

In 1987 and 1988, two more volumes of the book with the first 100 of the ''1000 Meisterwerke'' were published. The series ended in 1994, but without coming near to 1000 episodes.

Today, the series is sporadically shown by [[3sat]], [[BR-alpha|ARD-alpha]] and [[Classica (TV channel)]].&lt;ref name="i3"&gt;http://www.wunschliste.de/links.pl?s=1542 13 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parodies==

===''Stenkelfeld''===

The German comedy series, ''[[Stenkelfeld]]'', parodied "''100 Meisterwerke''" several times. Episode titles included "''Die Hochzeitszeitung''" (The Wedding Newspaper), "''Die Tischdecke''" (The Tablecloth), "''Deutscher Behördenschreibtisch''" (German Office Desk) and "''Deutscher Wohnwagen''" (German Mobile Home).&lt;ref name="i4"&gt;http://www.stenkelfeld.de/gewerbe/kunstgalerie/kunstgalerie.html 13 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Das Testbild''===
In 1994 ORF produced, in the form of a regular episode of ''1000 Meisterwerke'', an ironic special called ''Das Testbild''. It made [[Testcard|TV test cards]] its subject: "Patrons are often at a loss in front of pictures like this one. Some will already have asked themselves silently if this really is art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AML4DNwNhIM |title=1000 Meisterwerke: Das Testbild |last=Sedlacek |first=Paul-M. |last2=Neuwirth |first2=Petra |year=1994 |website=YouTube |publisher=ORF |type=Video |access-date=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Affective fallacy''' is a term from [[literary criticism]] used to refer to the supposed error of judging or evaluating a text on the basis of its emotional effects on a reader. The term was coined by [[William Kurtz Wimsatt, Jr.|W.K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] in 1949 as a principle of [[New Criticism]] which is often paired with their study of ''The Intentional Fallacy''. 

==Concept==
The concept of affective fallacy is an answer to the idea of impressionistic criticism, which argues that the reader's response to a poem is the ultimate indication of its value. It is the antithesis of affective criticism, which is the practice of evaluating the effect that a literary work has on its reader or audience. The concept was presented after the authors had presented their paper on ''The Intentional Fallacy''.

First defined in an article published in ''The Sewanee Review'' in 1949, the concept of an affective fallacy was most clearly articulated in ''The Verbal Icon'', Wimsatt's collection of essays published in 1954. Wimsatt used the term to refer to all forms of criticism that understood a text's effect upon the reader to be the primary route to analyzing the importance and success of that text. This definition of the fallacy, if strictly followed, touches on or wholly includes nearly all of the major modes of literary criticism, from [[Ovid]]'s ''docere delictendo'' (to teach by delighting), [[Aristotle]]'s [[catharsis]],  and [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]]'s concept of "transport" to late-nineteenth century [[belles-lettres]] and the contemporary [[Chicago Critics]]. For Wimsatt, the fallacy led to a number of potential errors, most of them related to emotional relativism. A view of literature based on its putative emotional effects will always be vulnerable to mystification and subjectivity; Wimsatt singles out the belletristic tradition exemplified by critics such as [[Arthur Quiller-Couch]] and [[George Saintsbury]] as an instance of a type of criticism that relies on subjective impressions and is thus unrepeatable and unreliable.

For Wimsatt, as for all the New Critics, such impressionistic approaches pose both practical and theoretical problems. In practical terms, it makes reliable comparisons of different critics difficult, if not irrelevant. In this light, the affective fallacy ran afoul of the New Critics' desire to place literary criticism on a more objective and principled basis. On the theoretical plane, the critical approach denoted as affective fallacy was fundamentally unsound because it denied the iconicity of the literary text. New Critical theorists stressed the unique nature of poetic language, and they asserted that—in view of this uniqueness—the role of the critic is to study and elucidate the thematic and stylistic "language" of each text on its own terms, without primary reference to an outside context, whether of history, biography, or reader-response.

In practice, Wimsatt and the other New Critics were less stringent in their application of the theory than in their theoretical pronouncements. Wimsatt admitted the appropriateness of commenting on emotional effects as an entry into a text, as long as those effects were not made the focus of analysis.

==Reception==
As with many concepts of [[New Criticism]], the concept of the affective fallacy was both controversial and, though widely influential, never accepted wholly by any great number of critics.

The first critiques of the concept came, naturally enough, from those academic schools against whom the New Critics were ranged in the 1940s and 1950s, principally the historical scholars and the remaining belletristic critics. Early commentary deplored the use of the word "fallacy" itself, which seemed to many critics unduly combative. More sympathetic critics, while still objecting to Wimsatt's tone, accepted as valuable and necessary his attempt to place criticism on a more objective basis.

However, the extremism of Wimsatt's approach was ultimately judged untenable by a number of critics. Just as [[New Historicism]] repudiated the New Critics' rejection of historical context, so [[reader-response criticism]] arose partly from dissatisfaction with the concept of the text as icon.  Reader-response critics denied that a text could have a quantifiable significance outside its being read and experienced by particular readers at particular moments. These critics rejected the idea of text as icon, focusing instead on the ramifications of the interaction between text and reader.

While the term remains current as a warning against unsophisticated use of emotional response in analyzing texts, the theory underlying the term has been thoroughly eclipsed by more recent developments in criticism.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Wimsatt and Beardsley==

"The Affective Fallacy is a confusion between the poem and its results (what it is and what it does), a special case of [[epistemological]] skepticism [ ... which ...] begins by trying to derive the standard of criticism from the psychological effects of the poem and ends in impressionism and relativism [with the result that] the poem itself, as an object of specifically critical judgment, tends to disappear." 

"The report of some readers ... that a poem or story induces in them vivid images, intense feelings, or heightened consciousness, is neither anything which can be refuted nor anything which it is possible for the objective critic to take into account." 

Wimsatt and Beardsley on an ideal, objective criticism: "It will not talk of tears, prickles or other physiological symptoms, of feeling angry, joyful, hot, cold, or intense, or of vaguer states of emotional disturbance, but of shades of distinction and relation between objects of emotion."

"The critic is not a contributor to statistical countable reports about the poem, but a teacher or explicator of meanings. His readers, if they are alert, will not be content to take what he says as testimony, but will scrutinize it as teaching."

{{Culture of Albania}}

The '''Architecture of Albania''' ({{IPA-sq|aɾˈki:tɛk:uɾa ʃcipˈta:ɾɛ}} — {{lang-sq|Arkitektura e Shqipërisë}}) is a reflection of [[Albania]]'s historical and cultural heritage.&lt;ref name="hisarch"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Keida Lulo, Kevin Tummers|title=History of Albanian Architecture Model, Various Authors, 1970 - 2.12.ARCHITECTURE and Urban Development|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:K1Re5ez6erQJ:www.seda.org.al/download/i/mark_dl/u/4012653116/4611166538/2.3-Architecture.pdf+&amp;cd=7&amp;hl=de&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=de|website=seda.org.al|page=1|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's architecture was influenced by its location within the [[Mediterranean Basin]] and progressed over the course of history as it was once inhabited by numerous civilisations including the [[Illyrians]], [[Ancient Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]s, [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s, [[Venetian Empire|Venetian]]s, [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s as well as modern [[Austro-Hungarian empire|Austro-Hungarian]]s and [[Italians]]. In addition, missionaries, invaders, colonisers and traders brought cultural changes that had a large profound effect on building styles as well as techniques.

During [[classical antiquity]], cities and towns in Albania have evolved from within the [[castle]] to include [[dwelling]]s, religious and commercial structures, with constant redesigning of town squares and evolution of building techniques. Although there are prehistoric and classical structures in the country, which effectively begins with constructions from the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] such as in [[Byllis]], [[Amantia]], [[Phoenice]], [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Butrint]] and [[Shkodër]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=POLITISCHE ORGANISATIONSFORMEN IM VORRÖMISCHEN SÜDILLYRIEN|url=http://www.fondazionecanussio.org/atti2003/siewert.pdf|website=fondazionecanussio.org|page=58|language=German|format=PDF|quote=Die Urbanisierung Illyriens begann im späten 5.

After the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], Albania became an integral part of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. They have left a legacy, most visible in the cities and surroundings of [[Korçë]], [[Berat]], [[Voskopojë]] and [[Gjirokastër]], in the form of castles, churches and monasteries with grandiose wealth of visible [[mural]]s and [[fresco]]s. The country also has many surviving monuments from the [[Ottoman Albania|Ottoman]] period. They left their mark with the many mosques and other buildings they constructed, that contributed to make Berat and Gjirokastër an UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In the 18th and 19th century, Albanian medieval towns underwent urban transformations by various Austro-Hungarian and Italian architects, giving them the appearance of western European cities; this can be particularly seen in [[Tirana]] and Korçë. They introduced [[architectural style]]s such as [[Historicism (art)|Historicism]], [[Art Nouveau]], [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] and [[Neoclassicism]].

Following the establishment of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communism in Albania]], the country's architecture development was radically changed by the socialist ideology and numerous historic and [[Sacred architecture|sacred]] buildings across Albania were demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Karin Myhrberg - [[University of Gothenburg]]|title=Heritage from the Communist Period in Albania - An Unwanted Heritage Today?|url=https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/29221/1/gupea_2077_29221_1.pdf|website=gupea.ub.gu.se|location=Gothenburg|page=12|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Arta Dollani, Antonella Lerario and Nicola Maiellaro|title=Sustaining Cultural and Natural Heritage in Albania|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/8/792/pdf|website=mdpi.com|pages=1–19|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many socialist-styled complexes, wide roads and factories were constructed, while squares in major towns were redesigned.

== Overview of Albania ==
{{See also|Geography of Albania|History of Albania}}

[[File:Albania space.jpg|137px|thumb|Topography of [[Albania]].]]

Albania is a [[Mediterranean]] country, lying to the east of [[Italy]], across the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Although the country occupies the southwestern portion of the [[Balkan Peninsula]], bordered by [[Montenegro]] to the northwest, [[Kosovo]]{{efn|name=status}} to the northeast, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the east and [[Greece]] to the south and southeast. It has a varied and contrasting topography with high mountains, rocky shores, coastal wetlands, sandy beaches, steep canyons and gorges and islands of various shapes and sizes.

In terms of topography, the country encompasses [[coastal plain]]s in the west to the [[Albanian Alps]] in the north, the [[Sharr Mountains]] in the northeast, [[Central Mountain Range, Albania#Skanderbeg Mountains|Skanderbeg Mountains]] in the center, [[Korab|Korab Mountains]] in the east, [[Pindus Mountains]] in the southeast and [[Ceraunian Mountains]] in the southwest along the [[Albanian Riviera]] and [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast|Ionian Sea Coast]].

The country experiences mostly [[Mediterranean climate|mediterranean]] climate with [[Continental climate|continental]] influences.&lt;ref name="climate1"&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Ministry of Environment (Albania)|Ministry of Environment of Albania]]|title=Albania's Second National Communication to the Conference of Parties under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/albnc2.pdf|website=unfccc.int|location=Tirana|page=28|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; That means that the climate is characterised by mild winters and hot, dry summers. The warmest areas of the country are along the west, where climate is profoundly impacted by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The coldest parts of the country are at the north and east, where snowy forested climate is prevalent.

During the [[Iron Age]], Albania was originally home to the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greeks]]. Following the centuries, it was subsequently conquered and occupied by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s, [[Venetian Republic|Venetian]]s and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s. The emergence of a unified Albanian state dates back to the establishment of the [[Principality of Arbër]] in 1190 AD.

== Periods ==

=== Antiquity ===

The beginnings of architecture in Albania dates back to the middle [[Neolithic Age]] with the discovery of prehistoric dwellings in Dunavec and [[Maliq]].&lt;ref name="neo"&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization]]|title=Archaeology and art of Albania, Ecuador, China, Bulgaria|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0007/000748/074870eo.pdf|website=unesdoc.unesco.org|pages=4–6|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were built on a wooden platform that rested on stakes stuck vertically into the [[soil]].&lt;ref name="neo"/&gt; Prehistoric dwellings in Albania consist of three types such as houses enclosed either completely on the ground or half underground, both found in [[Cakran]] near [[Fier]] and houses constructed above ground.
[[File:Amphitheatre of durres albania 2016.jpg|210px|thumb|left|The [[Amphitheatre of Durrës]] is on the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Albania#Tentative list|tentative list]] for becoming a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].]]
During the [[Bronze Age]], the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] started to organize itself in the territory of Albania. The Illyrians were an [[ethnic group]] with distinct culture and art, while it is believed that [[Albanians]] are the descendants of the Illyrians but no enough evidence is left to get a conclusion. Cities within [[Illyria]] were mainly built on the tops of high mountains surrounded by heavily fortified walls. Further, the history of Albania has not been kind to the Illyrian architectural monuments. Few monuments from the Illyrians are still preserved such as in [[Amantia]], [[Antigonia (Chaonia)|Antigonia]], [[Byllis]], [[Rozafa Castle|Scodra]], [[Lissus]] and [[Royal Tombs of Selca e Poshtme|Selca e Poshtme]].&lt;ref&gt;Gilkes, O., Albania An Archaeological Guide, I.B.Tauris 2012, {{ISBN|1780760698}}, p263&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Amphitheatre of Butrint 2009.jpg|210px|thumb|right|[[Butrint]] has been included in the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[UNESCO]]|title=Butrint|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/570|website=whc.unesco.org|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Following the [[Illyrian Wars]], the architecture in Albania developed significantly in the 2nd century BC with the arrival of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s. The conquered settlements and villages such as [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]], [[Butrint]], [[Byllis]], [[Dyrrachium]] and [[Dropull|Hadrianopolis]] were notably modernised following Roman models, with the building of a forum, roads, theatres, promenades, temples, aqueducts and other social buildings. The period also marks the construction of stadiums and thermal baths that were of social importance as places of gathering.

Previously populated by various [[Illyrian tribes|Illyrian]] and [[Ancient Greek tribes]], [[Butrint]] became a [[protectorate]] and subsequently a [[Colonia (Roman)|colony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Inge Lyse Hansen|title=Hellenistic and Roman Butrint|publisher=Butrint Foundation, 2009|isbn=9780953555680|url=https://books.google.de/books?hl=de&amp;id=nFoqAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=butrint+roman+architecture&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=butrint+|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Inge Lyse Hansen, Richard Hodges, Sarah Leppard|title=Butrint 4: The Archaeology and Histories of an Ionian Town|publisher=Oxbow Books, 2013|isbn=9781842174623|page=9|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=q3x-AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=butrint+roman+architecture&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy5_Wkiv3YAhWM2qQKHe_vB7gQ6AEISzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=butrint%20roman%20architecture&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nowadays, it demonstrates a high level of Roman urbanisation, while it is among the best preserved remains of Roman heritage in Albania. They left its legacy in form of city walls, an aqueduct, the forum, [[basilica]]s, [[Baptistery|baptister]]ies, baths, an [[amphitheatre]] and [[Insulae|houses]] for the middle classes, as well as [[Domus|mansions]] with central courtyards which were decorated with various mosaics and murals.

[[Dyrrachium]] thrived during the Roman period and became a protectorate after the Illyrian Wars. The [[Durrës Amphitheatre|Amphitheatre of Durrës]], which the Romans built, was at that time the largest amphitheatre in the [[Balkan Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Albania|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides, 2015|isbn=9781841628554|page=87|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=ZR3XBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=dyrrachium&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=M0l655960E&amp;sig=vDqIETWT82pXwqFo8RIjF8KK5vU&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiptZu_lP3YAhWQGOwKHVfLDkQ4ChDoAQg2MAE#v=onepage&amp;q=dyrrachium&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the only Roman monument that survived up to the present.

The [[Via Egnatia]], built by [[Roman Senate|Roman Senator]] [[Gnaeus Egnatius]], functioned for two millennia as a multi-purpose highway, which once connected the cities of [[Durrës]] on the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the west to [[Constantinople]] on the [[Marmara Sea]] in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Frank Sear|title=Roman Architecture - Cornell paperbacks|publisher=Cornell University Press, 1983|isbn=9780801492457|page=270|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Rkdt_p6uvw0C&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=via+engatia+architecture&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0LgjYep-lP&amp;sig=4X9MRTt4yILklQwVHfeUgBg479M&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfjIW3kf3YAhXCyKQKHcR1BtQQ6AEITzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=via%20engatia%20architecture&amp;f=false|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the route gave the Roman colonies of the [[Balkans]] a direct connection to Rome.

=== Middle Ages ===

Medieval cities in Albania are classified according to two criteria:

*Cities associated with fortifications, such as Berat and Gjirokastra
*Cities that lie in flat or steep terrains such as Tirana, Kavaja, and Elbasan.

During the [[Middle Ages]], a variety of [[architecture style]]s developed in the form of dwelling, defence, worship and engineering structures.
When the [[Roman Empire]] divided into east and west, Albania remained under the [[Eastern Roman empire|Eastern Roman Empire]]. In behalf to that, the architecture was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]s. Many extensive churches and monasteries were built during that period mainly in the centre and south of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Agricultural University of Tirana]]|title=Considering Importance of Light in the PostByzantine Church in Central Albania|url=https://www.ijirset.com/upload/2013/november/8B_Considering.pdf|website=ijirset.com|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some inherited historic structures were damaged by invading [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the consolidation of the Albanian feudal principalities gave rise to ''Varosha'', or neighbourhoods outside city walls. Examples of such developments are the [[Arberesh]] principalities centred in [[Petrele]], [[Kruje]] and [[Gjirokastra]] originating from the feudal castle. In the 15th century, close attention was given to protective structures such as the castle fortifications of Lezha, Petrela, [[Devol (Albania)|Devoll]], Butrint, and [[Shkodra]]. More reconstructions took place in strategic points such as the Castle of [[Elbasan]], [[Preza]], [[Tepelena]], and [[Vlora]], the latter being the most important on the coast. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the great Pashaliks of the period such as the Bushati Family, [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha]], and [[Ali Pashe Tepelena]] reconstructed several fortifications such as the Castle of Shkodra, Berat, and Tepelena respectively. It is important to note that Ali Pashe Tepelena embarked on a major castle building campaign throughout Epirus.

[[File:Ardenica Monastery (by Pudelek).JPG|220px|thumb|left|The [[Ardenica Monastery]] near Fier.]]

During the medieval period, mosques in Albania fell into two categories: those covered with a dome, and those with a roof covered hall. The latter were immediately adopted following the Ottoman invasion, by transforming the existing churches of Shkodra, Kruje, Berat, Elbasan and Kanina. For instance, the [[Lead Mosque, Shkodër|Lead Mosque]] built by [[Mustafa Pasha Bushati]] in Shkodra resembles a typical Istanbul mosque.

On the other hand, Christian religious structures inherited many features from their palaeo-Christian predecessors. Between the 16th and 19th centuries, a series of small structures for Christian with simple layouts were built like the [[Voskopoja]] basilica, [[Ardenica Monastery]], and Church of St. Nicholas in Voskopoja. The latter is one of the most valuable architectonic monuments in Albania. Its interior walls are covered with paintings by the renowned painter [[David Selenica]], and by brothers Constantine and Athanasios Zografi.

=== Modern ===

During the 18th century, the city silhouette in Albania began to include places of worship and the Clock Tower. These, together with other social structures such as thermal baths, fountains, and ''[[madrasa|medrese]]'' further enriched the city centre and its neighbourhoods.

In the 19th century, the ''bazaar'' emerges as a production and exchange centre, while the city expands beyond the castle, which completely loses its function and inhabitants. During this period, Shkodra and Korca become important commerce and skilled crafts centres.
 
[[File:Tirana_panorama_2016.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The [[Skanderbeg Square]] in [[Neo-renaissance|Neo-Renaissance]] style.]]

The first half of the 20th century begins with the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] occupation, continues with [[Fan Noli]]'s government, [[King Zog]]'s kingdom, and ends with the Italian invasion. During this time, Albanian medieval towns underwent urban transformations by Austro-Hungarian architects, giving them the appearance of European cities.

The centre of [[Tirana]] was the project of [[Florestano Di Fausto]] and Armando Brasini, well known architects of the [[Benito Mussolini]] period in Italy. Brasini laid the basis for the modern-day arrangement of the ministerial buildings in the city centre.

The plan underwent revisions by the Albanian architect Eshref Frashëri, the Italian architect Castellani, and the Austrian architects Weiss and Kohler. The rectangular parallel road system of Tirana e Re district took shape, while the northern portion of the main Boulevard was opened. These urban plans formed the basis of future developments in Albania after the [[second World War]].

From 1944 to 1991, cities experienced an ordered development with a decline in architectural quality. Massive socialist-styled [[apartment]] complexes, wide roads, and [[factories]] were constructed, while town squares were redesigned and a number of historic buildings demolished.
 
The period after the fall of communism is often described negatively in terms of [[urban area|urban]] development. Kiosks and apartment buildings started to occupy former public areas without planning, while informal districts formed around cities from internal [[Immigration|migrants]] leaving remote rural areas for the western lowland. Decreasing urban space and increased traffic congestion have become major problems as a result of lack of planning. 
As part of the 2014 Administrative Division Reform, all town centres in Albania are being physically redesigned and façades painted to reflect a more Mediterranean look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=38109&amp;kat=88 |title=Ndarja e re, mbeten 28 bashki, shkrihen komunat &amp;#124; Shekulli Online |publisher=Shekulli.com.al |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2014-02-15 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140113102623/http://www.shekulli.com.al/web/p.php?id=38109&amp;kat=88# |archive-date=2014-01-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformaterritoriale.al/ |title=Reforma Territoriale - KRYESORE |publisher=Reformaterritoriale.al |accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much has been achieved, critics argue that there is no clear vision on Tirana's future. Some of the pressing issues facing Tirana are loss of public space due to illegal and chaotic construction, unpaved roads in suburban areas, degradation of Tirana's Artificial Lake, rehabilitation of Skanderbeg Square, an ever-present smog, the construction of a central bus station and lack of public parking space. Future plans include the construction of the Multimodal Station of Tirana and the tram line, rehabilitation of the Tiranë River area, construction of a new boulevard along the former Tirana Railway Station and the finishing of the Big Ring Road.

[[File:Berat UNESCO 2016 Albania.jpg|210px|thumb|Scenic view over Gorica.]]

[[Berat]], otherwise known as the city of a thousand windows, is a small city in Southern Albania. The architecture of Berat is diverse and enfolds the inheritance of the [[Illyrians]] and [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]] but also of various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city among others the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]]. Nevertheless, the cityscape is notably embossed by the [[Ottoman architecture|architectural style]] of the Ottomans and boasts a wealth of structures of exceptional [[History of Albania|historical]] and [[Albanian art|architectural]] interest. This led the city to become a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

[[File:Old town of berat albania 3.jpg|210px|thumb|left|The old town of Berat is dominated by Ottoman houses.]]

The city is separated intro three parts such as the residential quarter within the fortress or known as Kalaja, Mangalem and Gorica. The [[Berat Castle|Kalaja]] is believed to have been found in antiquity as it was the settlement of the [[Illyrian tribe|Illyrian]] tribe of the [[Illyrian tribe#Deretini|Desaretes]].&lt;ref name="briefhis"&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[UNESCO]]|title=Brief description of Berat|url=http://www.unesco.org/fileadmin/MULTIMEDIA/FIELD/Venice/pdf/special_events/Berat1.pdf|website=unesco.org|location=Berat|language=English|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, it was known as [[Antipatrea]] when the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s conquered the city and called it Albanorum Oppidum.&lt;ref name="briefhis"/&gt; Over the centuries it has been subject to numerous conquest by the Byzantines and Ottomans.

Kalaja is well-preserved and consists of numerous houses, most of which are built of stone. Numerous churches with extraordinary decorated [[icon]]s and [[mural]]s still survives including the [[Holy Trinity Church, Berat|Holy Trinity Church]] and [[St. Mary of Blachernae Church, Berat|St. Mary of Blachernae Church]]. Islamic architecture is represented with the ruins of the [[Red Mosque, Berat|Red Mosque]] and [[White Mosque, Berat|White Mosque]]. Worth seeing is the [[cistern]] that was constructed by the Romans. The prominent [[Onufri Museum of Icons]] is also located within the castle and displays works of [[Onufri]] and other important Albanian painter.

[[File:Berat_-_kalaja.jpg|210px|thumb|Remains of the [[Berat Castle]].]]

Houses within the Mangalem quarter were built along a steep hill towards the Gorica quarter. The facades that faces the valley have characteristically [[overhang (architecture)|overhanging windows]]. Therefore, Berat owes its titel to the district, the "city of a thousand windows". There are three Ottoman mosques that include the [[King Mosque, Berat|King Mosque]], [[Lead Mosque, Berat|Lead Mosque]] and notably the [[Bachelors' Mosque|Bachelors Mosque]]. The [[Halveti Teqe, Berat|Halveti Teqe]] stands behind the King Mosque and enclose an impressive carved ceiling.

Gorica was for a long time only connected through the [[Gorica Bridge]] to the rest of Berat. It is among the most popular Ottoman bridges in Albania that was built in 1780 by [[Ahmet Kurt Pasha|Ahmed Kurt Pasha]]. The Saint Spyridon Monastery is another prominent attraction due to its admirable [[Post-Byzantine architecture|Post-Byzantine style]].

[[File:Korca,_Albania_2017.jpg|210px|thumb|right|The [[Resurrection Cathedral, Korçë|Resurrection Cathedral]] in the center.]]

The architecture in [[Korçë]] is characterised by mansions and residential buildings, cobbled streets and wide boulevards with many cafés and restaurants. There is an architectural mix, due to the turbulent history, of [[Art Nouveau]], [[Neoclassicism]] and [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]] styles. Italian and French influences increased after the beginning of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. In modernising its infrastructure through the centuries, the city has preserved some of its history in its streets and facades.

Although [[bazaar]]s were typical Ottoman trading complexes developed in the towns of Albania and elsewhere in the [[Balkans]]. The Ottoman architecture is predominant within the bazaar, while recent reconstructions have led to the application of elements specific to [[modern architecture]].

The [[Resurrection Cathedral, Korçë|Resurrection Cathedral]] is located in the center north of Bulevardi Republika. It is one of the largest [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]] [[cathedral]]s in Albania, as well as one of the city's symbols and primary tourist attractions. The cathedral is a [[Nave|three-nave]] structure and belongs to [[Byzantine style]]. It stands slightly elevated on an [[Podium|estrade]] and consists mainly of cream-white to ivory-colored stones and red bricks. The interior walls and domes are decorated with [[icon]]s and [[fresco]]es.

The [[Mirahori Mosque]] was built in 1484 and founded by [[Iljaz Bey Mirahor]]. The [[minaret]] and dome of the building was damaged by an earthquake and was recently restored. It consists of white [[limestone]] blocks that lie on layers of red bricks. It is only one of the few monuments of the Ottoman period in the city and the surrounding county.

The combinations of brick and stone were very frequent in [[Ottoman architecture]], while brick was used mainly for arches, domes and vaults. Further, the most characteristic feature of those mosques is the dominance of a dome, having a semi-circular flat profile, that covered the significant part of the prayer hall within the mosque. The elegance of various Islamic elements is blended in and adapted into buildings and interior designs such as the use of tiling, geometric designs, floral motifs and murals.

The scenic [[Geography of Albania|landscapes]] of Albania are dotted with [[castle]]s, [[Fortification|fort]]s and [[citadel]]s in all shapes and sizes. Previously they was mostly defined by their practical use to repel invasions and often serve as a royal residence for noble families. Those structures constitute treasures and legacy of the [[History of Albania|historic past]] of Albania. The first castles in the Albanian lands were built by [[Illyrians]] and [[Romans]] and later by [[Venetian Republic|Venetians]] and [[Ottomans]]. The majority have been renovated throughout history and different epoches with changing rule and adaptations to war technology development.

[[File:Muzeum Skanderbega w Kruji 2.jpg|210px|thumb|left|The medieval [[Krujë Castle|Castle of Krujë]].]]

It stands in a very strategic point near the mouth of [[Shkumbin|Shkumbin River]] close to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The castle is a typical Venetian structure that combined the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] lancet arch with Byzantine and Ottoman influences.

[[Petrelë Castle]] is a medieval castle located on a hilltop overlooking [[Petrelë]] and [[Erzen river|Erzen Valley]]. The castle has a triangular structure with two observation towers. The early fortifications probably dates from the 3rd century, while in the 9th century it was expanded and served as a base for [[Gjergj Kastrioti Skënderbeu]] during its revolt against the [[Ottoman Empire]].

[[File:Rozafa Castle from Tarabosh.jpg|210px|thumb|left|Scenic view of [[Rozafa Castle]] in [[Shkodër]].]]

[[Rozafa Castle]] is an ancient castle in [[Shkodër]]. The castle is associated with a famous legend about a woman who was buried in the foundation of the castle. It stretches on a rocky hill and is trapped on three sides by the rivers of [[Bojana (river)|Buna]], Kir and [[Drin (river)|Drin]]. Its current name, Rozafa, appeared for the first time in the early [[Middle Ages]]. Later when the [[Ottomans]] conquered the [[Balkans]] the castle than was turned into a mosque.

The [[Gjirokastër Fortress|Citadel of Gjirokastër]], a hilltop fortress, dominates the cityscape of [[Gjirokastër]] and overlooks the strategically important route along the [[Drino river]] valley.

The castle is named after the Albanian [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina]], who ruled over the [[Pashalik of Yanina]] and even attempted to rival the [[Dey of Algiers]] in the seas. It is a small rectangular structure with battered walls, while along the corners, there are two battered round towers with cannons on its seaward side and two irregularly sized battered square towers equipped with firing loops or windows.

The [[Rodoni Castle]] stand within the [[Cape of Rodon]] with a proximity to the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Its name is derived from the [[Illyrian Gods|Illyrian god]] of Rodon. After the [[First Siege of Krujë]] and [[League of Lezhë]], the [[Kastrioti family|Kastrioti]]s decided to increase the fortifications for the use against the Ottomans. Skanderbeg chose the Cape of Rodon as the location of the castle and construction began in 1450.

* Houses with vater zjarri, or fireplace/hearth: These type of houses are primarily found in [[Tirana County]] and characterized by the house of fire (''Shtëpia e Zjarrit''), which takes up the height of two floors, with surrounding areas interacting around it. 
* Houses with hajat, or porch: A distinguishing feature of this style is the relationship of the house with the backyard and natural [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Oftentimes, these houses are built on flat grounds, with the ground floor used by inhabitants for agricultural purposes. For example, the Shijaku House in [[Tirana]] is surrounded by adobe walls with a large gate entrance, and almost always covered with a simple roof.
* Houses with ''çardak'', a type of balcony found on the top floor reserved for guests or relaxation: They are mostly found in [[Berat]], and less so in [[Kruje]] and [[Lezha]]. The cardak is a dominant element of the building's outer composition being on the main facade of the house, originally designed to be open. The cardak is extensively used by dwellers in the warm season by exploiting the natural sunlight. It also serves as liaison with other areas of the house. These houses are divided into several sub types: houses with cardak on the front area, on one side, or at the center. An example of such structures is Hajdar Sejdini House in [[Elbasan]]. 
* Urban or civic ''kulla'': They are found in [[Gjirokaster]] (see [[Zekate House]]), Berat, Kruje, and [[Shkoder]] used for defensive and warehouse purposes. The interior showed the extent of family's wealth, while the ground floor served as a safe place for cattle in the winter, and to keep water reserves for the dry summer months.

The southern urban or civic Kullas are found in the cities and surroundings of [[Berat]], [[Gjirokastër]], [[Himara]] and [[Këlcyrë]].&lt;ref&gt;Stubbs-Makaš 2011, [https://books.google.com/books?id=goCJx26btm0C&amp;pg=PA392&amp;dq=kule+tower+houses p. 392]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=LF-vT_KkIsfR8gOhnpDECQ&amp;hl=el&amp;id=UV1oAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22tower+houses%22+paramythia&amp;q=%22tower+houses%22#search_anchor Epirus, 4000 years of Greek history and civilization.] p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; Tower-houses in Gjirokastër were built in the 13th century predating Ottoman conquest.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?ei=d1yvT4PxDci48gO_7YnGCQ&amp;hl=el&amp;id=89ZKAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=byzantine+%22tower+houses%22&amp;q=%22cityscape+characterised+by+undulating+terrain+and+fortified+tower+houses%2C+imposing+fortifications+dating+from+the%22#search_anchor Internationale Tourismusattraktionen in Mittel- und Südosteuropa]. Österreichisches Ost- und Südosteuropa-Institut, 1999, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The northern Kullas are a heavily fortified residential building built in the north of Albania and [[Metohija|Dukagjin]] region of [[Kosovo]]. They contain small windows and shooting holes because their main purpose was to offer security from attack. Further they have been initially built from wood and stone and eventually only from stone.

The first Kullas were built in the 17th century, a time when there was continuous fighting in the Dukagjini region, although most of the ones that still remain are from the 18th or 19th century. They have been almost always built within a complex of buildings with various functions but Kullas in villages exists mostly as standalone structures. They are also positioned within the complex of buildings so that the inhabitants can look out over the surrounding area. Kullas in towns are usually built as standalone structures, while in villages they are more commonly found as a part of a larger ensemble of Kullas and stone houses, usually grouped together for the family clan they belonged to.

Certain Kullas were used as places of isolation and safe havens or "locked towers" (Kulla Ngujimi) intended for the use of persons targeted by [[gjakmarrja|blood feud]]s; an example can be found in [[Theth]].&lt;ref name="McAdamArcy2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marika McAdam|author2=Jayne d' Arcy|author3=Chris Deliso|author4=Peter Dragicevic|title=Western Balkans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5PSBrPoGf-8C&amp;pg=PA92|accessdate=11 May 2012|date=2 May 2009|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-729-5|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Kullas are three-story buildings. A characteristic unit of its architectural structure in "Oda e Burrave" (Chamber of Men or Gathering Room of Men), which was usually placed in the second floor of the Kulla, called Divanhane, while the ground floor served as a barn for cattle and the first floor was where the family quarters were located. The material from which the Divanhane is constructed, either wood or stone, is sometimes used to classify Kullas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Kulla of Mazrekaj family in Dranoc|date = |last = Limani|first = Jeta|url = http://www.lth.se/fileadmin/hdm/alumni/papers/CMHB_2007/Kosova___Jeta_Limani_-_Kulla_of_Mazrekaj_Family.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Arkitektura Vernakulare në Kosovë|last = Doli|first = Flamur|publisher = Association for the Preservation of Architectonic Heritage - SHRTA|year = 2009|isbn = 9789951878609|location = Prishtinë|pages = 93–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In marketing, '''art infusion''' is the general influence of [[work of art|artwork]]s on perceptions and evaluations of products with which the artworks are associated.

The term was first introduced in an article in the [[Journal of Marketing Research]] in 2008. [[Henrik Hagtvedt]] and Vanessa Patrick, the two researchers who authored the article, demonstrated a favorable influence of artworks on consumer evaluations of non-art products that were associated with the artworks via, for instance, advertising or [[product design]]. The authors suggested that the creation and appreciation of art has evolved through the millennia of [[Prehistory|human prehistory]], and that the universal human impulse to apply skill and creative effort to express oneself artistically is also reflected in the recognition of the objects thus created as belonging to a special category. This special category has several characteristics, including non-utility. This does not imply that artworks cannot have utility, but that creativity and skill are central to the creation and appreciation of the artwork, irrespective of any other functions, or lack thereof, that the artwork may serve. This non-utilitarian quest for excellence, when associated with other objects, leads to more favorable evaluations of those objects.

'''''Broken Blossoms or The Yellow Man and the Girl''''', often referred to simply as '''''Broken Blossoms''''', is a 1919 American [[silent film|silent]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[D.W. Griffith]]. It was distributed by [[United Artists]] and premiered on May 13, 1919. It stars [[Lillian Gish]], [[Richard Barthelmess]], and [[Donald Crisp]], and tells the story of young girl, Lucy Burrows, who is abused by her alcoholic prizefighting father, Battling Burrows, and meets Cheng Huan, a kind-hearted Chinese man who falls in love with her. It was the second film released by United Artists. It is based on [[Thomas Burke (author)|Thomas Burke]]'s short story "The Chink and the Child" from the 1916 collection ''[[Limehouse Nights]]''.

==Plot==
[[File:Broken Blossoms.webm|thumb|left|''Broken Blossoms'']] 
Cheng Huan ([[Richard Barthelmess]]) leaves his native [[China]] because he "dreams to spread the gentle message of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] to the Anglo-Saxon lands." His idealism fades as he is faced with the brutal reality of [[London]]'s gritty inner-city. However, his mission is finally realized in his devotion to the "broken blossom" Lucy Burrows ([[Lillian Gish]]), the beautiful but unwanted and abused daughter of boxer Battling Burrows ([[Donald Crisp]]).

After being beaten and discarded one evening by her raging father, Lucy finds sanctuary in Cheng's home, the beautiful and exotic room above his shop. As Cheng nurses Lucy back to health, the two form a bond as two unwanted outcasts of society. All goes astray for them when Lucy's father gets wind of his daughter's whereabouts and in a drunken rage drags her back to their home to punish her. Fearing for her life, Lucy locks herself inside a closet to escape her contemptuous father.

By the time Cheng arrives to rescue Lucy, whom he so innocently adores, it is too late. Lucy's lifeless body lies on her modest bed as Battling has a drink in the other room. As Cheng gazes at Lucy's youthful face which, in spite of the circumstances, beams with innocence and even the slightest hint of a smile, Battling enters the room to make his escape. The two stand for a long while, exchanging spiteful glances, until Battling lunges for Cheng with a hatchet, and Cheng retaliates by shooting Burrows repeatedly with his handgun. After returning to his home with Lucy's body, Cheng builds a shrine to Buddha and takes his own life with a knife to the chest.

* [[Donald Crisp]] as Battling Burrows

==Production and style==
[[File:Broken blossoms newspaper ad.png|thumb|right|220px|Newspaper ad for the film]]
Unlike Griffith's more extravagant earlier works like ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' or ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'', ''Broken Blossoms'' is a small-scale film that uses controlled studio environments to create a more intimate effect.

Griffith was known for his willingness to collaborate with his actors and on many occasions join them in research outings.&lt;ref name="Schickel, Richard 1984. page 391"&gt;Schickel, Richard. ''D.W. Griffith: an American Film Life.'' New York: Proscenium Publishers Inc, 1984. {{ISBN|0-87910-080-X}}, page 391&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Martin. ''Griffith: First Artist of the Movies.'' Oxford, Oxford University Press. 1980. {{ISBN|0-19-502685-3}}, 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual style of ''Broken Blossoms'' emphasises the seedy [[Limehouse]] streets with their dark shadows, drug addicts and drunkards, contrasting them with the beauty of Cheng and Lucy's innocent attachment as expressed by Cheng's decorative apartment. Conversely, the Burrows' bare cell reeks of oppression and hostility. Film critic and historian [[Richard Schickel]] goes so far as to credit this gritty realism with inspiring "the likes of [[G.W. Pabst|Pabst]], [[Mauritz Stiller|Stiller]], [[Josef von Sternberg|von Sternberg]], and others, [and then] re-emerging in the United States in the sound era, in the genre identified as [[Film Noir]]".&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, Richard. ''D.W. Griffith: an American Film Life.'' New York: Proscenium Publishers Inc, 1984. {{ISBN|0-87910-080-X}}, page 394&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffith was unsure of his final product and took several months to complete the editing, saying, "I can't look at the damn thing; it depresses me so."&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, Richard. ''D.W. Griffith: an American Film Life.'' New York: Proscenium Publishers Inc, 1984. {{ISBN|0-87910-080-X}}, page 395&lt;/ref&gt;

==Box office==
The film was originally made for Famous Players Lasky. The company sold it to the newly founded [[United Artists]] for $250,000. The film turned out to be a hit at the box office and earned a profit of $700,000.&lt;ref name="tino"/&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Broken blossoms lobby card LOC.jpg|thumbnail|right|Lobby card for the film, showing the early scene in which drunken Western sailors fight on a street in China]]
''Broken Blossoms'' premiered in May 1919, at the [[George M. Cohan|George M. Cohan Theatre]] in [[New York City]] as part of the D.W. Griffith Repertory Season.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Iris. ''D.W. Griffith: American Film Master.'' New York: Museum of Modern Art Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-87070-683-7}}, page&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lillian Gish's autobiography, theaters were decorated with flowers, moon lanterns and beautiful Chinese brocaded draperies for the premiere. Critics and audiences were pleased with Griffith's follow-up film to his 1916 epic ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dell, Paul. ''Griffith and the Rise of Hollywood.'' Manchester: Castle Books, 1970. {{ISBN|0-498-07718-7}}, page 127&lt;/ref&gt; Contrasting with ''Intolerance'''s grand story, set and length, Griffith charmed audiences by the delicacy with which ''Broken Blossoms'' handled such a complex subject.
{{Quote|Reviewers found it "Surprising in its simplicity"...the acting seemed [[wikt:nine day wonder|nine days' wonder]] – no one talked of anything but Lillian's smile, Lillian turned like a tormented animal in a trap, of Barthelmess' convincing restraint. Few pictures have enjoyed greater or more lasting [[wikt:succès d'estime|succès d'estime]]."&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Iris. ''D.W. Griffith: American Film Master.'' New York: Museum of Modern Art Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-87070-683-7}}, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The scenes of [[child abuse]] nauseated backers when Griffith gave them a preview of the film; according to Lillian Gish in interviews, a ''Variety'' reporter invited to sit in on a second take left the room to vomit.&lt;ref&gt;Affron, Charles, ''Lillian Gish, Her Legend, Her Life'' (Scribner, 2002), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, ''Broken Blossoms'' is widely regarded as one of Griffith's finest works. In 2012, the film received five critics' votes and one director's vote in the [[British Film Institute]]'s decennial ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' poll. [[Roger Ebert]] was a longtime champion of the film, having added it to his "Great Movies" series; and in 1996, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

Review aggregation site ''They Shoot Pictures, Don't They'' has since found ''Broken Blossoms'' to be the 261st most acclaimed film in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/gf1000_all1000films_table.php |title=1,000 Greatest Films (Full List) |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Cruelty and injustice against the innocent are a recurring theme in Griffith's films and are graphically portrayed here. The introductory card says, "We may believe there are no Battling Burrows, striking the helpless with brutal whip — but do we not ourselves use the whip of unkind words and deeds? So, perhaps, Battling may even carry a message of warning."

''Broken Blossoms'' was released during a period of strong anti-Chinese feeling in the US, a fear known as the [[Yellow Peril]]. The phrase "yellow peril" was common in the U.S. [[newspapers]] owned by [[William Randolph Hearst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746032,00.html | work=Time | title=Foreign News: Again, Yellow Peril | date=September 11, 1933 | accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also the title of a popular book by an influential U.S. religious figure, [[G. G. Rupert]], who published ''The Yellow Peril; or, Orient vs. Occident'' in 1911. Griffith changed Burke's original story to promote a message of tolerance. In Burke's story, the Chinese protagonist is a sordid young Shanghai drifter pressed into naval service, who frequents [[opium den]]s and whorehouses; in the film, he becomes a Buddhist missionary whose initial goal is to spread the word of Buddha and peace (although he is also shown frequenting opium dens when he is depressed). Even at his lowest point, he still prevents his gambling companions from fighting.

==The "closet scene"==
The most-discussed scene in ''Broken Blossoms'' is Lillian Gish's "closet" scene. Here Gish performs Lucy's horror by writhing in the [[claustrophobic]] space like a tortured animal who knows there is no escape.&lt;ref name="Schickel, Richard 1984. page 392"&gt;Schickel, Richard. ''D.W. Griffith: an American Film Life.'' New York: Proscenium Publishers Inc, 1984. {{ISBN|0-87910-080-X}}, page 392&lt;/ref&gt; There is more than one anecdote about the filming of the "closet" scene, [[Richard Schickel]] writes:
{{Quote|It is heartbreaking – yet for the most part quite delicately controlled by the actress. Barthelmess reports that her hysteria was induced by Griffith's taunting of her. Gish, on her part, claims that she improvised the child's tortured movements on the spot and that when she finished the scene there was a hush on stage, broken finally by Griffith's exclamation, "My God, why didn't you warn me you were going to do that?"&lt;ref name="Schickel, Richard 1984. page 392"/&gt;}}
The scene is also used to demonstrate Griffith's uncanny ability to create an aural effect with only an image.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dell, Paul. ''Griffith and the Rise of Hollywood.'' Manchester: Castle Books, 1970. {{ISBN|0-498-07718-7}}, page 125&lt;/ref&gt; Gish's screams apparently attracted such a crowd outside the studio that people needed to be held back.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Martin. ''Griffith: First Artist of the Movies.'' Oxford, Oxford University Press. 1980. {{ISBN|0-19-502685-3}}, page 114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remake==
A UK remake, also titled ''[[Broken Blossoms (1936 film)|Broken Blossoms]]'', followed in 1936.

'''''Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips''''' is a 1944 ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoon directed by [[Friz Freleng]].&lt;ref name=bcdb&gt;{{bcdb|3765|Bugs Bunny Nips The Nips}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Somewhere in the Pacific, Bugs is floating in a box, singing to himself, when 'the island that inevitably turns up in this kind of picture' turns up. Bugs swims towards it, and admires the peace and quiet, when bombs start going off ("The Storm" from the ''[[William Tell Overture]]'' is also heard in the background). Bugs ducks into a haystack, and soon comes face to face with a Japanese soldier; a short, buck-toothed, bare-footed Japanese man who says his 'Ls' as 'Rs' and who might be rapidly stating the names of Japanese cities whenever he moves. The soldier chases Bugs to a rabbit hole, where the soldier dumps a bomb inside. However, Bugs manages to blow the soldier up with the bomb. When the soldier tries to swing a sword at Bugs, Bugs appears as a Japanese general (presumably [[Hideki Tojo]]), but is soon recognized by his trademark carrot eating, prompting the soldier (who says he saw Bugs in the "Warner Bros. Leon Schlesinger ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoon pictures", referring to the fact that Bugs was originally exclusive to that series) to ask him "What's up, Honorable Doc?"

Bugs then jumps into a plane and the soldier also jumps into a plane. However, Bugs ties the soldier's plane to a tree, causing the plane to be yanked out from under him. The soldier parachutes down, but is met by Bugs in mid-air, who hands "Moto" (cf. [[Mr. Moto]]) some 'scrap iron' (an [[anvil]]),&lt;ref&gt;This is a reference to US companies selling scrap metal to Japan before the war.&lt;/ref&gt; causing the soldier to fall. Painting a Japanese flag on a tree to denote one soldier down, Bugs runs into a [[sumo wrestler]], whom he confidently faces off against (cockily marking a second bigger flag on the tree). After getting temporarily beaten by the sumo wrestler (and, to be fair, wipes the second mark off the tree before collapsing), Bugs dresses as a [[Geisha|geisha girl]] and knocks the wrestler out, who repaints a second flag on the tree before passing out.

Seeing a bunch of Japanese landing craft making their way to the island (exclaiming "Japs! Hundreds of 'em!"), Bugs thinks of a plan to get rid of all of them. He comes out in a 'Good Rumor' (a parody of [[Good Humor]]) truck, which plays Mozart ("Der Vogelfänger bin ich ja" from ''[[The Magic Flute]]''). Bugs hands each of the Japanese an ice cream bar with a grenade inside it, calling them racist slurs such as "monkey-face" and "slant-eyes" whilst doing so. All the Japanese are killed off from the explosions, save for one who was killed after redeeming a 'free' ice cream bar from Bugs. Having now painted dozens of Japanese flags on the trees denoting all the downed enemy, Bugs comments again about the 'peace and quiet – and if there's one thing I CAN'T stand, it's peace and quiet!'.

Bugs spots an American battleship in the distance and raises a white flag, yelling for them to come get him, but they keep going.  Bugs is insulted. "Do they think I want to spend the rest of my life on this island?" With this remark, a female rabbit (dressed in a more Hawaiian outfit) appears saying, "It's a possibility!"  Bugs then pulls down the distress flag, lets out a wolf cry and goes running after her.

==Analysis==
The films depicting the Japanese enemy during World War II tended to both identify a formidable wartime adversary and to depict said adversary as inferior to its American counterparts. In cartoons, this translated to a tendency to depict the Japanese as either superman or buffoon. This film closer represents the latter tendency.&lt;ref name="Fuller"&gt;Fuller (2001), p. 285-287&lt;/ref&gt; The caricature portrayal of this film serves as a host to well-worn stereotypes.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt;

The film opens with Bugs singing from within a crate.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"&gt;Fuller (2010), p. 138-139&lt;/ref&gt; He is somewhere in the Pacific and is waiting for the inevitable island to turn up.&lt;ref name="Shull"&gt;Shull, Wilt (2004), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; He then sees an island and swims towards its beach.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; Already in the introduction, Bugs identifies his Pacific island setting as a "[[garden of Eden]] and a "[[Shangri-La]]". This in reference to the exotic havens depicted in South Sea island films and to the epic film ''[[Lost Horizon (1937 film)|Lost Horizon]]'' (1937). Only then is Bugs alerted to the mortal danger that awaits him on the island. The seductive first impression serves to set up a hazardous trap.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt;

Bugs escapes rapid gunfire by running for cover into a haystack.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; The initial encounter of Bugs with a Japanese soldier presents an optical illusion, that the two share a body. Bugs' head peeks above the haystack, while the legs of the soldier appear below it.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt; Then the owner of the feet confronts Bugs. The soldier has buck teeth, a thin mustache, dark eyeglasses, slanted eyebrows and curly, wavy hair.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt;

The soldier pulls out a sword and starts swiping at Bugs. He speaks in Oriental-sounding [[gibberish]], consisting of short syllables spoken in a [[staccato]] voice. In response, Bugs assumes the form of a Japanese general and stands stiffly at attention.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; Bugs' face is briefly transformed into a Japanese caricature, only to be contrasted with the face of an actual, if impish, Japanese soldier. Bugs disguised as a general imitates photographs of [[Hideki Tojo]].&lt;ref name="Fuller3"&gt;Fuller (2010), p. 141-143&lt;/ref&gt; The soldier bows in supplication to the authority figure. Bugs accidentally gives away his identity by casually chewing on a carrot.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt;

The soldier resumes use of his sword and talks gibberish again. Bugs takes off in a Japanese plane, followed by the soldier in his own plane.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; Both planes are presumably based on the [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]].&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; Bugs ties the rival plane to a tree. The soldier parachutes out and Bugs hands him an anvil. Mocking: "Here's some scrap iron for Japan, Moto."&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; There is a spoken reference to [[Mr. Moto]] to provide a well-acquainted name to the wartime enemy.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt;

Bugs then bumps into a [[Rikishi|sumo wrestler]]. The man is huge with a large stomach, a mustache, a goatee, buck teeth with a large gap between the front teeth, and a [[Mohawk hairstyle]]. In response, Bugs transforms into a [[geisha]]. He speaks in Japanese-sounding gibberish and coaxes the wrestler into a near kiss. The kiss turns into a fatal blow with a [[mallet]]. Bugs triumphantly shouts "timber" as the man falls.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; The [[Masquerade ball|masquerade]] scene involving the wrestler and the geisha makes use of two relatively harmless civilian-type characters to cast the enemy in a humorous light.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt; In concept, it suggests that an Oriental guise can be put on and discarded at will.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt;

Bugs then sees several Japanese ships floating towards the island. He is next seen disguised as [[ice cream truck|Ice cream car]] vendor in the mold of the [[Good Humor]] man. He entices many Japanese soldiers to come get their ice cream.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; There are many Japanese soldiers besieging Bugs' ice cream truck. Suggesting that their threat relies on their numbers. They are an easily fooled mob, not a group of individuals.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt; They resemble a swarm of bees and they are rendered less as human figures and more like a scourge in need of extermination.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt;

Bugs insults his customers by calling them "monkey face" and "slant eyes".&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; The scene with the ice cream track partially obscures the faces and bodies of the enemy soldiers, but Bugs verbalizes a physical description. The phrases "bowlegs", "monkey face", "slant eyes" both serve as racial epithets and audibly support the visualized stereotypes of the film. They are all elements of the Japanese wartime caricature.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt;

They get served with chocolate-covered ice cream bars embedded with grenades.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt; The soldiers run off as soon as they get served. Then numerous explosions are heard.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt; One battered soldier returns to present his specially-marked stick, earning him a free ice cream bar. He is the last one.&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; Bugs' mission is accomplished. He then signals an American ship to come get him.&lt;ref name="Fuller2"/&gt;

Bugs hates being confined to a world of "peace and quiet". He celebrates the approach of an American ship and his potential rescue, until he meets a [[sarong]]-clad female bunny.&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; The female bunny ignites his passion. He howls and thumps his foot, his eyes bulging from their sockets. He leaps into an amorous pursuit and the film ends.&lt;ref name="Lerner"&gt;Lerner (2010), p. 210-213&lt;/ref&gt;

The short placed an emphasis on physical peculiarities to imply racial inferiority. The preeminent danger is positioned to be treachery and not military might.&lt;ref name="Fuller"/&gt; The Japanese are distinctively [[Othering|othered]] as physically deformed.&lt;ref name="Fuller3"/&gt; The Japanese are characterized as single-minded, subservient to their superiors and gullible. The gag with the ice cream-seeking soldiers makes use of the American perception of the Japanese as both gullible and greedy. Bugs' stereotypical portrayal of Japanese womanhood renders him a meek and seductive creature, speaking in a falsetto voice.&lt;ref name="Brcak"&gt;Brcak, Pavia (2002), p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

The short has similarities to both ''[[Wackiki Wabbit]]'' (1943) and ''[[Herr Meets Hare]]'' (1945).&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; The soundtrack includes ''Trade Winds'' and ''Someone's Rocking My Dreamboat''.&lt;ref name="Shull"/&gt; There are two musical quotations from ''[[Die Walküre]]'' (1870) by [[Richard Wagner]].&lt;ref name="Lerner"/&gt; The Japanese soldiers are repeatedly presented on screen to the tune of the ''[[Kimigayo]]'' (1870)&lt;ref name="Lerner"/&gt; The ice cream truck scene uses the tune of the opening aria of Papageno, from ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' (1791) by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]].&lt;ref name="Lerner2"&gt;Lerner (2010), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; When Bugs professes his hatred of the peace and quiet, demanding someone to get him out of this place, the tune is the ''[[Ride of the Valkyries]]''.

Neil Lerner attempts to decipher [[Carl Stalling]]'s intentions in quoting Wagner at the end of the battle scenes. He suggests that it is connected to the role of the [[Valkyrie]]s, taking fallen warriors to [[Valhalla]]. In this case, the use is ironic as Stalling would not view the deceased Japanese soldiers as fallen heroes who deserve an afterlife paradise.&lt;ref name="Lerner3"&gt;Lerner (2010), p. 217-218&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bugs signals the American ship, the tune is from the scene where [[Brynhildr|Brünnhilde]] announces her pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Lerner3"/&gt; Lerner suggests that Stalling was inspired by the name of [[Sigurd|Siegfried]], "peace through victory". Stalling could intend the scene to represent the United States reaching such a peace. Alternatively, he might be inspired by the stark isolation of Brünnhilde on a rocky mountain – in which case, the reference would have been Bugs being trapped on the island.&lt;ref name="Lerner4"&gt;Lerner (2010), p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
*Since the 1960s, "Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips" has become very controversial because the short stereotypes against Japanese people. However, the cartoon was not one of the "[[Censored Eleven]]" and was occasionally shown on television in syndicated packages with other pre-August 1948&lt;ref&gt;The latest released WB cartoon sold to a.a.p. was ''[[Haredevil Hare]]'', released on July 24, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. cartoons whose copyrights were under the ownership of [[Associated Artists Productions]]. The short debuted on home video in December 1991 on [[The Golden Age of Looney Tunes#Volume 1|the first volume of ''Golden Age of Looney Tunes'']] [[laser disc]] collection. The niche market format did not cause a stir, but when the 5-disc set was later issued in the more accessible VHS format on 10 separate tapes in 1993, Japanese groups went against its distribution. Originally, [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (the copyright owners of the Turner/Associated Artists Productions shorts at the time) defended against the Japanese groups and did not withdraw the release, but later they changed their minds and both releases were withdrawn. Future releases for both formats replaced the cartoon with ''[[Racketeer Rabbit]]'', which already appeared on another LaserDisc and VHS set. The VHS reissue combined volumes 4 and 7 of the 10-tape set.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1995/02/17/wwii-cartoons-pulled/f190dd30-5da9-4e7a-ba92-52edb9fd2f45/&lt;/ref&gt; After the pulling of the short in 1993 from home video, the short was also pulled from American television networks and has been since.
*This was one of the 12 Bugs Bunny cartoons that were pulled out of Cartoon Network's June Bugs 2001 marathon by order of [[AOL Time Warner]] due to stereotypes of Japanese people. However, in a promo for this event, the scene where Bugs does a double-take on noticing the female rabbit was used.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsz9Kqxx0dg&lt;/ref&gt; This cartoon was shown, albeit in clips, on a special episode of the Cartoon Network show ''[[ToonHeads]]'' about cartoons from the World War II era, while a voiceover explained how Japanese stereotypes in World War II cartoons tended to be very cruel (as shown in Norm MacCabe's ''[[Tokio Jokio]]'', this cartoon and clips of World War II-era [[Popeye]] cartoons).
*This cartoon was made during [[World War II]], and reflects the United States' attitude towards one of its main enemies at the time, the [[Empire of Japan]]. In the cartoon, [[Bugs Bunny]] lands on an island in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and is pitted against a group of highly [[Stereotype|racially stereotyped]] Japanese soldiers. Bugs shows no mercy against the Japanese soldiers, greeting them with several [[racial slurs]] such as "monkey face" and "slant eyes", making short work of a large [[sumo wrestler]], and bombing most of the Japanese army using various explosives, including grenades hidden in [[ice cream bar]]s. The cartoon's title is a play on the verb "nip" as in "bite" and "[[Nip]]s", which at the time was a widely used [[List of ethnic slurs|slur]] for Japanese people, as the Japanese word for "Japan" is "Nippon" (or "Nihon").
*The ''[[Film Daily]]'' called the seven-minute short "good fun", and gave the following synopsis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Bugs Bunny, castaway on a Pacific isle, thinks the setting is ideal until he finds his paradise infested with Japanese soldiers. How he single-handedly exterminates the enemy makes for a laugh-filled few minutes of typical Bugs antics, off-screen remarks and action in this Technicolor cartoon produced by Leon Schlesinger."&lt;ref&gt;"Reviews of New Films," ''The [[Film Daily]]''. 5/10/44. p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cato's Letters''''' were essays by British writers [[John Trenchard (writer)|John Trenchard]] and [[Thomas Gordon (writer)|Thomas Gordon]], first published from 1720 to 1723 under the pseudonym of [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] (95–46 [[BCE]]), the implacable foe of [[Julius Caesar]] and a famously stubborn champion of [[Roman Republic|republican]] principles (''[[mos maiorum]]'').

== Purpose ==

The ''Letters'' are considered a seminal work in the tradition of the [[Commonwealth men]]. The 144 essays were published originally in the ''[[London Journal]]'', later in the ''[[British Journal]]'', condemning corruption and lack of morality within the British political system and warning against tyranny.

== Publication ==

The ''Letters'' were collected and printed as ''Essays on Liberty, Civil and Religious''.&lt;ref&gt;John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon. ''Essays on Liberty, Civil and Religious, and Other Important Subjects''. ed. and annotated by Ronald Hamowy. 2 vols. (Indianapolis, Liberty Fund, 1995). The standard modern edition.&lt;/ref&gt; A measure of their influence is attested by six editions printed by 1755. A generation later their arguments immensely influenced the ideals of the [[American Revolution]]; According to Peter Karsten's book Patriot-Heroes in England and America, Cato's Letters were the most common holdings on the bookcases of the founding fathers. &lt;Ref&gt;Karsten, Peter. 1978. ''Patriot-Heroes in England and America''. The University of Wisconsin Press. Pages 34-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later unrelated antithetic usage ==

Cato was used as a pseudonym by the [[Dr. William Smith|Reverend Dr. William Smith]], the most influential preacher in [[Philadelphia]], in a series of essays arguing against American independence in the [[Pennsylvania Gazette]] published April 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, Thomas. Letter. ''Pennsylvania Magazine'' 1776: n.p. ''Online Library of Liberty.'' Web. 21 Aug. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Cato was later appropriated as a pseudonym in a series of letters to the ''New York Journal'' in 1787 and 1788 opposing [[James Madison]]'s views and urging against ratification of the [[United States Constitution]]. Many historians attribute these letters to [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]], though their authorship has not been definitively proven. These letters are unrelated to the Trenchard and Gordon letters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/v1ch4s16.html Cato #3]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==

These letters also provided inspiration and ideals for the [[American Revolution]]ary generation. The essays were distributed widely across the [[Thirteen Colonies]], and frequently quoted in newspapers from [[Boston]] to [[Savannah, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Annie|title=A Liberal Republican "Cato"|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=July 2004|volume=48|doi=10.1111/j.0092-5853.2004.00089.x }}&lt;!--|accessdate=3 May 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Renowned historian [[Clinton Rossiter]] stated "no one can spend any time on the newspapers, library inventories, and pamphlets of colonial America without realizing that Cato's Letters rather than [[John Locke]]'s [[Two_Treatises_of_Government#Second_Treatise|Civil Government]] was the most popular, quotable, esteemed source for political ideas in the colonial period."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rossiter|first=Clinton|title=Seedtime of the Republic: the origin of the American tradition of political liberty|year=1953|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|location=New York|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cato Institute]], a [[Washington, D.C.]], [[think tank]] founded by [[Edward H. Crane]] in 1977, takes its name from ''Cato's Letters''.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;Cato Institute, [http://www.cato.org/about.php "About Cato"], undated, accessed January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Clara Tice''' (22 May 1888 – 2 February 1973) was an American [[avant-garde]] illustrator and artist, who spent most of her life in [[New York City, United States]]. Because of her provocative art and public appearances, she was seen as representative of bohemian [[Greenwich Village]] and thus known as "The Queen of Greenwich Village."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=414–441|author=Keller, Marie T.|authorlink=Clara Tice|editor=Naomi Sawelson-Gorse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
According to herself and the ''[[New York Times]]'', in 1908 Tice was the first woman in Greenwich Village to bob her hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Vogue of Bobbed Hair: Of Course Greenwich Village Lassies Wear Short Locks, But Society's Doing It Too|journal=New York Times|date=27 June 1920|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Tice was able to study under the famous artist and teacher [[Robert Henri]]. In 1910, Henri and some of his artist friends, organized the first exhibition of Independent Artist. This art show, which was with its jury-free and no-awards concept quite a revolution at that time and thus received enormous attention, was financially backed by Tice and featured her works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=415–416|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immersion in the arts ==
A few years later, namely in 1915, Tice's fame skyrocketed when [[Anthony Comstock]], main founder of the [[Society for the Suppression of Vice]], tried to confiscate Tice's art at the well-known bohemian restaurant Polly's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Naumann|first=Francis M.|title=New York Dada 1915-23.|year=1994|publisher=Abrams|location=New York|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter images of Tice's artworks and photos of the artist were featured in magazines such as ''[[Vanity Fair (American magazine 1913–1936)|Vanity Fair]], Rogue, [[The Blind Man]],'' and ''[[Cartoons magazine]]''. During that time she had several one-person exhibitions and also worked on numerous other projects, for example, she created posters for bohemian costume balls and played herself in the 1922 version of the ''Greenwich Village Follies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=416–429|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During those years, Tice not only played an important part in Greenwich Village's colorful art scene, but also joined the Arensberg Circle in their uptown location. It was probably [[Marcel Duchamp]] who introduced Tice to Walter and Louise Arensberg and their salon. There she met [[Henri-Pierre Roché]], with whom she spent several evenings. Tice also participated in two projects by the Arensberg Circle: first, two of her works were shown in the first exhibition of the [[Society of Independent Artists]] and second, one of her works was featured in ''The Blind Man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=425–427|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s, she illustrated about a dozen books with her erotic images,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=432–434|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; these are nowadays expensive collector's items. In 1940, her own book called ''ABC Dogs'' was published. It is a children's book in which each letter of the alphabet is represented by a dog breed whose name starts with the same letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tice|first=Clara|title=ABC Dogs|year=1940|publisher=Funk|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication sparked renewed interest in Tice and her art. She also worked on her memoirs, which she never completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women in Dada: Essays on Sex, Gender, and Identity|year=1998|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=414–441|author=Keller, Marie T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film also recycles a handful of plot devices from another television series, ''[[The White Shadow (TV series)|The White Shadow]],'' which director Carter also co-starred in. The ensemble cast features [[Rob Brown (actor)|Rob Brown]], [[Channing Tatum]], [[Debbi Morgan]], and musical entertainer [[Ashanti (entertainer)|Ashanti]].

The film was a [[International co-production|co-production]] between the motion picture studios of [[MTV Films]] and [[Tollin/Robbins Productions]]. Theatrically and for the home video rental market, it was commercially distributed by [[Paramount Pictures]]. ''Coach Carter'' explores professional ethics, academics and athletics.&lt;ref name="film"&gt;[[Thomas Carter (director)|Thomas Carter]]. (2005). ''Coach Carter'' [Motion picture] Production Notes. United States: [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;/ref&gt; The sports action in the film was coordinated by the production company ReelSports.  On January 11, 2005, the original motion picture soundtrack was released by the [[Capitol Records]] music label. The film score was composed and orchestrated by musician [[Trevor Rabin]].

''Coach Carter'' premiered in theaters nationwide in the United States on January 14, 2005 grossing $67,264,877 in domestic ticket receipts. The film took in an additional $9,404,929 in business through international release for a combined worldwide total of $76,669,806. Preceding its initial screening in cinemas, the film was generally met with positive critical reviews. With its initial foray into the home video marketplace; the widescreen DVD edition of the film featuring deleted scenes, a music video, and special features among other highlights, was released in the United States on June 21, 2005.

Despite the film being based on real events taking place during the 1999–2000 school year, there are several references that would have been impossible to make in 1999, including a reference to a player possibly going into the NBA straight out of high school being similar to [[LeBron James]], who was a freshman during the 1999–2000 school year.

==Plot==
In 1999, Ken Carter takes over the head coaching job for the basketball team at his former high school [[Richmond High School (Richmond, California)|Richmond]], having played on the team himself and earning records. Carter quickly sees that the athletes are rude and disrespectful, and are in need of discipline. He hands the players individual contracts, instructing them to attend all of their classes, sit in the front row of those classes, wear dress shirts and ties on game days, refer to everyone (players and coach alike) as "sir", and maintain a 2.3 (C+) grade point average, among other requirements. Carter also asks the school staff for progress reports on the players' grades and attendance. He teaches them to play a disciplined brand of basketball.

In the gym, Carter is faced by hostility from the players and one of them, Timo Cruz attempts to punch Carter but Carter stops Cruz by putting his arm on Cruz's back and pushing him against the wall. Cruz quits the team in anger along with two other players, the previous season top scorers. Carter warns them that, if they are late for practice, then they will run suicides (a type of sprint touching the court's lines), and, if they act disrespectfully towards him, then they will do push-ups.  He then orders them to do a series of suicides for one hour to improve their conditioning. Later, Carter's son, Damien, decides to join the team, after quitting the private school St. Francis. Shocked, Carter asks why he did this, and Damien tells him that he wants to play for his father.  Carter reluctantly agrees but holds his son to a higher set of standards than the rest of the team.

Kenyon Stone struggles to come to terms with his girlfriend, Kyra who is pregnant, unsure if he can juggle basketball and prepare for college as well as be a parent. In their opener against Hercules, Cruz watches the team win and then asks Carter what he has to do to get back on to the team. Carter agrees but on one condition: he needs to do 2,500 push-ups and 1,000 suicides before Friday.

During a practice, Carter tells Cruz to give up because it is impossible to complete all of the push ups and suicides by Friday. When the day arrives, Cruz is short by 500 push-ups and 80 suicides.  Other players, however, volunteer to do push-ups and suicides for him, saying they are a team and when one person fails they all fail, when one person triumphs, they all triumph, thereby getting him back on the team. On a game day, Carter asks Cruz what his biggest fear is, and Cruz is confused by the question. Later, the team won the game. Carter learns that one particular student does not attend classes: Junior Battle. Later in practice, Carter talks to Battle, who does not seem to be worried about it, so Carter suspends him for games. After a confrontation, Battle leaves the team in anger. Afterwards, Battle's mother asks Carter to let him back on the team. Carter says that he needs to hear that from Battle himself. Battle apologizes for what he did and is allowed back on the team, but is told that he had to do 1,000 push-ups and 1,000 suicides to make up for it.

At the winter dance, Stone talks to his girlfriend about the baby and says he does not want to live that way. He asks her what she's going to do after the baby is born and believes that she would not know what to do. She angrily tells him that she is having the baby with or without his support.

The team goes on to have an undefeated record, eventually winning the Bay Hill Holiday tournament. The team go off to a party hosted in a girl's house, without the knowledge of her parents. After looking for the players to celebrate, Carter goes to the house and orders his team to leave. In the bus going home, Carter criticizes his team for their reckless behavior, while Cruz points out that they won the tournament and already gave Carter what he wanted: winners. Back at school, Carter discovers that the progress reports show that some of the students have been skipping classes and failing academically. Enraged, Carter locks the gym, and sends his players to the library to study with their teachers. This upsets the players, especially Cruz, who quits the team again, stating that he had tried so hard to do all those push-ups and suicides for Carter, to get back on the team in the first place.

Later, although this priority to good values is praised in the national media, Carter is criticized by parents and academic personnel alike for his decision to lock down the gym. One night, someone throws a brick through Carter's store window for not letting the team play. The next day, a man pulls up next to Carter's car at a stoplight then proceeds to spit on his window, taunting him about his decision to lock down the gym. Carter became enraged and tries to hit him, but Damien breaks up the fight. Later that evening, while Cruz is hanging out with his drug dealer cousin Renny, he saves three of his teammates from being harassed by some gangsters, but when the drug deal goes wrong, his cousin is shot dead, leaving Cruz distraught. Cruz goes to the Carters' house and begs to be allowed back on the team. Carter comforts him and allows it.

The school board eventually confronts Carter, who explains how he wants to give his team the opportunity and option for further education so that they won't turn their lives around into crime, asserting that achieving a sound education is more important for the students than winning basketball games. A man suggests that Carter should be removed from the basketball coach position, which the board does not have the power to decide that, which then leads him to suggest that they should end the lockout. Carter promises that he will quit if the lockout is ended. Principal Garrison and the chairman vote to not end the lockout, but the other board members (four) vote in favor of ending it. Afterwards, Carter is shocked to find his players in the gym with desks and teachers, studying and working to bring their grades back up. The athletes decide to fulfill Carter's original intention of them pursuing academic achievement before continuing to play their next game. Cruz answers Carter's question about fear and thanks him for saving his life. They work hard and eventually raise their grade point average to a point that fulfills their contracts. Later, Stone talks to Kyra about the baby and tells her that he worked it out so she and the baby go to college with him. She reveals that she had an abortion by her own choice, and tells Kenyon that he should focus on playing college basketball. He asked Kyra to come with him to college with or without the baby and she agrees.

The Oilers eventually end up competing in the state CIF high school playoffs, but come up short to St. Francis by just 2 points after a game winning three-point shot by rival Ty Crane. Nevertheless, Carter is proud of his players accomplishing their goals of having a proper education. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics stating that a number of players went on to attend college and play basketball, such as Kenyon, Lyle, Junior, "Worm", Cruz, and Damien.

'''''Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood''''' (or simply '''''Don't Be a Menace''''') is a 1996 American [[crime film|crime]] [[comedy film|comedy]] [[parody film]] directed by [[Paris Barclay]] in his feature film directorial debut, and produced by [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]], and also written by Wayans brothers [[Shawn Wayans|Shawn]] and [[Marlon Wayans]], who also both starred in the lead roles. The film was released in the United States on January 12, 1996.

Similar to ''[[I'm Gonna Git You Sucka]]'', the film spoofs a number of [[African Americans|African-American]], [[coming-of-age]], [[hood film]]s such as ''[[Juice (film)|Juice]]'', ''[[Jungle Fever (film)|Jungle Fever]]'', ''[[South Central (film)|South Central]]'', ''[[Higher Learning]]'', ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'', ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]'', ''[[New Jack City]]'', ''[[Dead Presidents]]'', ''[[Friday (1995 film)|Friday]]'', and most prominently ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'', ''[[Menace II Society]]'' and ''[[Above the Rim]]''. The film's title borrows phrases from some of those films, and some of the actors who starred in those movies appear in the film, in some cases appearing in similar roles or scenes as the films being parodied.

== Plot ==
Ashtray, Tray for short, is sent to the inner city to live with his father. Tray gets an education about life on the streets from his psychotic, gun-toting cousin Loc Dog, Preach, and Crazy Legs. At a picnic Tray falls for the infamous Dashiki much to the distaste of ex-convict Toothpick. While Ashtray and Loc Dog head to buy some snacks, Toothpick and his posse confront Ashtray and hold him at gunpoint, until Loc Dog threatens them with a missle mounted in the back of his van, stamped with the letters “USSR” Loc Dog claims it is in fact a nuclear device. Toothpick and his gang then flee the scene.

Loc Dog and Ashtray get harassed in a Korean store by the owners and Loc Dog shoots at the owners when a remark is made about his mother. The two are then confronted by 'The Man' (a mysterious white, government figure) who kills the Koreans and tosses them his gun to frame them and leaves.

Meanwhile, Ashtray and Loc Dog's Grandma ride to church and another elderly woman disses her, resulting in a breakdancing contest that Grandma wins.

Ashtray visits Dashiki where they engage in [[sexual intercourse]] and Dashiki immediately claims he has impregnated her. Feeling like he's not responsible enough to be the father, Dashiki kicks him out. Someone from Toothpick's posse threatens Ashtray, Loc Dog, Preach, and Crazy Legs. Loc Dog knocks him out as he and Preach proceed to stomp him, flattening him (literally). The quartet decides to get protection from their friend Old School. This tactic fails as Toothpick performs another drive-by and Crazy Legs is injured. With Crazy Legs hospitalized, himself and Loc Dog being arrested, and the Korean store shooting, Tray decides to confront Dashiki and be the father. Dashiki agrees to give Tray another try and they decide to leave the hood as planned. Ashtray and Loc Dog talk about Ashtray's departure as Toothpick and his posse prepare for another drive-by and he and Loc Dog clash as Ashtray flees and trips and is knocked out as Loc and Toothpick continue to shoot at each other. They are saved when Grandma pops out of the dumpster and shoots Toothpick's car as Toothpick is flung out and he lands on a cop car. Preach and Dashiki find Ashtray hurt and he regains consciousness and kisses Dashiki. A woman finds Toothpick (who turns out to be his mother) and beats him with his shoe for stealing from her in the past afterwards toothpick and his gang are arrested.

Afterwards, everyone goes their separate ways: Ashtray and Dashiki marry and enjoy their lives, Loc Dog becomes a host and introduces himself with extreme profanity, Preach and his crush settle down and perform sexual intercourse, Crazy Legs becomes a dancer as he had dreamed of, and Grandma is, as Ashtray puts it, "still Grandma" (showing her smoking [[marijuana]]).

==Cast==
* [[Shawn Wayans]] as Ashtray, the [[everyman]], trying to make his way through a confusing world, is sent by his mother to live in the [[ghetto]] where his father might teach him how to become a man. Based on Tre Styles from ''[[Boyz n the Hood]]'' and Caine Lawson from ''[[Menace II Society]]''.
* [[Vivica A. Fox]] as Ashtray's mother, whose one-scene, one-line cameo at the beginning ends with her son asking: "So will I see you again?" and her reply, "Sorry baby. You know there ain't no positive black females in these movies." Based on Reva Devereaux-Styles from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* Lahmard Tate as Ashtray's father, Ashtray's temperamental role model who dispenses sage advice to his son. According to Ashtray, he is only "a couple years older than I am." Although many references were made to Ashtray possibly being older than he was, such as Ashtray attending a party that his father is not old enough to attend. Based on Furious Styles from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* [[Marlon Wayans]] as Loc Dog: Ashtray's cousin and gangsta/drug dealer/criminal. He drives a [[United States Postal Service|USPS]] delivery truck which is loaded in the back with ballistics, including a nuclear weapon. Based on O-Dog from ''Menace II Society'' and Doughboy from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* [[Helen Martin]] as Grandma, Ashtray and Loc Dog's grandmother; a marijuana-smoking, foul-mouthed, church-going woman.
* [[Chris Spencer (actor)|Chris Spencer]] as Preach, Ashtray's friend and former gang member turned 'politically conscious' activist, resembling a [[Nation of Islam]] member, but is now just "confused"; he has a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] for white girls. Based on Sharif from ''Menace II Society'' and Ali from ''South Central''.
* [[Suli McCullough]] as Crazy Legs: Ashtray's friend; was paralyzed in a [[Drive-by shooting|drive-by]]. Has a dream to be a professional dancer. Based on Chris from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* Tracey Cherelle Jones as Dashiki, the object of Ashtray's affections. A "hood mother" with seven kids by seven different men. Dashiki's address is [[69 (sex position)|6969]] [[sexual intercourse|Penetration]] Avenue. Based on Ronnie from ''Menace II Society'' and Justice from ''[[Poetic Justice (film)|Poetic Justice]]''.
* Isaiah Barnes as Doo Rag: Dashiki's oldest son and the only one of her kids who has more than one line of dialogue. He pulls a gun on Ashtray after losing a video game. When he admits he learned about guns from "cartoons and 'hood movies'", Ashtray passionately declares that he and Doo Rag are an endangered species—not because their lives are in danger, but because "rappers are taking all the good acting jobs!". The kid rolls his eyes as Ashtray lectures him about the values of education. Based on Anthony from ''Menace II Society''
* Darrell Heath as Toothpick, Dashiki's ex-boyfriend, who was just released from prison and still acts like he's incarcerated. He swears he will kill Ashtray for romancing Dashiki. Based on Ferris from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* [[Antonio Fargas]] as Old School
* [[Bernie Mac]] as Officer Self Hatred, a cop who harasses Ashtray and Loc Dog. As he has Ashtray pinned against his squad car, he goes on and on about how much he hates black people and anything black. Based on the bully cop from ''Boyz n the Hood''.
* [[Terri J. Vaughn]] as Keisha: A possessed woman that Loc Dog met at the late night party and takes to the cargo hold of his truck. While proceeding to have sex with her, she morphs into a demonic version of herself and proceeds to force Loc Dog to have sex with her. It is unknown what happened after this. Based on Abby the 1974 blaxploitation horror film about a woman who is possessed by an African sex spirit.
* Benjamin N. Everitt as The Man, a pale white man with red hair and glasses, who systematically robs a [[convenience store]] while the Korean owners are keeping a close, racist eye on Ashtray and Loc Dog and completely ignore his crimes. When Loc Dog is firing his gun at the owners and not hitting them, The Man fires his gun once and hits a hanging light that falls on the owners and kills them. He then tosses his gun to an unwitting Ashtray and Loc Dog, who mistakenly catch it as he scratches their names off his list of black men whom he's framed for crimes and peels off a single glove (a reference to the [[O.J. Simpson]] case).
* Fozeyl Fuzz Atcha as Dave the Crackhead, a drug user apparently going through withdrawal who offers to perform [[fellatio]] in return for spare change or directions to a person's house. Based on the nameless "Basehead" character from ''Menace II Society''.
* [[Keenen Ivory Wayans]] as The Mailman; he appears various times throughout the film shouting "Message!" whenever a moral lesson is expressed without subtlety in dialogue. At the end of the film, when Loc Dog gives a rambling speech to Ashtray, the Mailman appears, and says, "What the fuck is he talking about?"
*[[LaWanda Page]] as Old School's mom

'''''Elseworlds''''' was the publication [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]] for [[American comic books]] produced by [[DC Comics]] for stories that took place outside the [[DC Universe]] [[Canon (fictional)|canon]].&lt;ref name="comicsthroughtime"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Booker|first1=M.

From 1942 to the mid-1980s, particularly during the 1960s — the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]] era — DC Comics began to make a distinction between the continuity of its fictional universe and stories with plots that did not fit that continuity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} These out-of-continuity stories eventually came to be called ''Imaginary Stories''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The title page of "Superman, Cartoon Hero!" stated that the story was "Our first imaginary story", and continued to say: "In 1942, a series of Superman shorts started showing throughout the U.S.! So, with tongue firmly in cheek, the DC team turned out this story of what might have happened if [[Lois Lane]] had decided to see... Superman, Cartoon Hero!".&lt;ref name="Superman"&gt;''Superman'' #183 (Jan. 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; The story opens with Lois determined to learn Superman's secret identity and going to the theater to see the [[Superman (1940s cartoons)|Max Fleisher ''Superman'' short]] "[[Superman (animated short)|Mad Scientist]]" in hopes of seeing the animated Man of Steel reveal his secret identity. In addition to other things, when the opening credits roll and state that the cartoons are based on DC Comics, Lois Lane states that she has never heard of DC Comics. [[Clark Kent]] then wonders if the people there are clairvoyant. In the final panel, Clark Kent exchanges a knowing wink with the image of himself as [[Superman]] on the movie screen.&lt;ref name="Superman"/&gt;

[[Craig Shutt]], author of the ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' column ''Ask Mr. Silver Age'', states that true imaginary stories differed from stories that were dreams and hoaxes.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} Dreams and hoaxes were "gyps" on account of "not having happened" whilst true imaginary stories were canonical at least unto themselves. Also, since they were "just" imaginary and thus had no bearing on the characters’ regular stories, imaginary stories could show things like people dying and the victory of evil.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} In the optimistic and hopeful Silver Age of Comics, such stories usually would not be told; this was hinted with writers telling readers how such an Imaginary Story often reassured the readers that it did not really happen.{{or|date=March 2015}}

Most of these imaginary stories featured [[alternate histories]] of characters, such as "[[Superman Red/Superman Blue|The Amazing Story of Superman-Red and Superman Blue!]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} There, readers saw possible pasts that could have happened, but did not happen. One such story has Superman being raised by apes in imitation of [[Tarzan]], an idea that would be recycled into a later ''Elseworlds'' tale where Tarzan and Superman were switched at birth. Possible present times were shown, such as one story where [[Jonathan and Martha Kent]], touched by pity, adopt a recently orphaned [[Bruce Wayne]] and raise him along with their own son, Clark. Thus, the present shows Superman and Batman as brothers, with Clark protecting Gotham and working for the ''Gotham Gazette'' instead of living in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], and [[Batman]] inviting his foster parents, the Kents, to live with him in Wayne Manor. In keeping with the fact that imaginary stories allowed for much grimmer stories than usual, the story ended with [[Lex Luthor]] killing the Kents and Batman trying to murder him in revenge.

{{rquote|right|This Super-Wedding is REAL!&lt;br&gt;The marriage is not a HOAX!&lt;br&gt;The bride and groom are not ROBOTS!&lt;br&gt;This romance is not a DREAM of LOIS LANE or SUPERMAN!|''Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane'' #15 (Feb. 1960)}}
Possible futures that "could very well happen" were explored, such as [[Relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane|Clark Kent revealing to Lois Lane his secret identity and marrying her]]. Futures that "perhaps never will" happen were also examined, such as the permanent death of Superman. ''Imaginary Stories'' appeared often enough that some comics – such as ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' #15 (February 1960), the cover of which appears to depict Superman marrying Lois Lane – had to assure readers that their contents were not "imaginary". The cover of ''Lois Lane'' #59 (August 1965), by contrast, promised that its depiction of Lois as romantic rival of [[Lara (comics)|Lara]], [[Jor-El]]'s girlfriend and future mother of Superman, was "real--'''not''' imaginary!".

A few ''Imaginary Stories'' appeared in other DC publications. Batman editor [[Jack Schiff]] supervised stories in which the Dark Knight starts a family or loses his identity, though these were revealed at the end of the story to be stories written by [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]].&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #131 (April 1960)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Batman'' #135 (Oct. 1960)&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff's stories were notable for the first appearance of the [[Bruce Wayne Junior|original Bruce Wayne Junior]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Writer/editor [[Robert Kanigher]] supervised [[Wonder Woman]]'s own series of ''Imaginary Stories'' called ''Impossible Tales'' which featured the same principle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} There, Wonder Woman appeared along with her younger selves, [[Wonder Girl]] and [[Wonder Tot]]. However, the majority of ''Imaginary Stories'' were published in various Superman comics under the guidance of Superman editor [[Mort Weisinger]], the "King of Imaginary Stories".{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} This was in part because, according to Shutt, Weisinger aimed for younger readers instead of older ones.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Later editors such as [[Julius Schwartz]] rarely used the ''Imaginary Stories'' concept.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Alan Moore]]'s "[[Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?|Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow]]?" two-part story in ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' #423 and ''[[Action Comics]]'' #583 in 1986 was the last Pre-''Crisis'' story to use the ''Imaginary Stories'' label.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===''Elseworlds'' imprint===
The first ''Elseworlds'' title was ''[[Gotham by Gaslight]]'' (1989), written by [[Brian Augustyn]] and drawn by [[Mike Mignola]], which featured a [[Victorian Age]] version of the [[superhero]] Batman hunting [[Jack the Ripper]], who had come to [[Gotham City]]. The title was not originally published as an ''Elseworlds'' comic, but its success led to the creation of the ''Elseworlds'' imprint and this title was retroactively declared the first ''Elseworlds'' story.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The first book to feature the ''Elseworlds'' logo was ''[[Batman: Holy Terror]]'' in 1991.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} In 1994, the ''Elseworlds'' imprint was used as the theme for the [[annual publication|annual edition]] comic books of that summer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

DC sporadically published various ''Elseworlds'' titles from 1989 to 2003. In August 2003, editor Mike Carlin mentioned that DC had scaled back the production of ''Elseworlds'' books in order to "put the luster back on them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sullivan|first1=Michael Patrick|title=CHICAGO DAY 2: New 'Challengers of the Unknown,' Richard Corben Monthly Announced, DC Teams with Aspen|url=http://www.cbr.com/chicago-day-2-new-challengers-of-the-unknown-richard-corben-monthly-announced-dc-teams-with-aspen/|website=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=2015-03-10|date=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several titles that were announced as ''Elseworlds'' books prior to this, such as ''Superman &amp; Batman: Generations IV'' and ''The [[Teen Titans]] Swingin' Elseworlds Special'', were cancelled.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} The planned ''Teen Titans'' tale was released in January 2008 as the ''Teen Titans Lost Annual''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schedeen|first1=Jesse|title=Teen Titans: The Lost Annual Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/01/09/teen-titans-the-lost-annual-review|website=IGN|accessdate=2015-03-10|date=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, [[Dan DiDio]] revealed the return of the ''Elseworlds'' imprint as a series of Prestige Format books, with the approach of taking the basic concepts and origins of DC characters and twisting them in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rogers|first1=Vaneta|title=20 Answers &amp; 1 Question with Dan Didio|url=http://www.newsarama.com/3834-20-answers-1-question-with-dan-didio-9-14-09.html|website=Newsarama|date=2009-09-14|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only ''Elseworlds'' story released under the initiative was the three-issue miniseries ''Superman: The Last Family of Krypton'', published from August to October 2010, which told the story of baby Kal-El reaching Earth with his mother and father and how the world handles the emergence of a superpowered family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/comics/superman-the-last-family-of-krypton |title=Superman: The Last Family of Krypton Comics |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2015-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship to DC continuity====
Although the ''Elseworlds'' imprint was created to feature stories separate from DC continuity, concepts from various ''Elseworlds'' stories were incorporated into DC continuity at various times.

''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]]'' miniseries in 1999 brought the ''[[Kingdom Come (comics)|Kingdom Come]]'' miniseries into DC continuity as part of a series of alternate timelines known as [[Hypertime]], which included some of the alternate worlds depicted in various ''Elseworlds'' titles.&lt;ref&gt;''The Kingdom'' #2 (Feb. 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

A new [[Multiverse (DC Comics)|Multiverse]] was introduced at the conclusion of the ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' weekly series that includes alternate worlds that were previously seen in various ''Elseworlds'' titles.&lt;ref&gt;''52'' Week Fifty-Two (May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In other media ==
The fifth annual crossover of the [[Arrowverse]] series is set to be titled "[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]", and will include ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'', ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]''. This crossover will introduce [[Batwoman]], [[Gotham City]], [[Nora Fries]], and [[Lois Lane]] to the Arrowverse, and is set to air on December 9–11, 2018 on [[The CW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2018/09/26/arrowverse-crossover-elseworlds-theme-batwoman-gotham/|title=Arrowverse Crossover Theme Is 'Elseworlds,' Casts Multiverse Observer|last=Mitovitch|first=Matt Webb|work=[[TV Line]]|date=September 26, 2018|accessdate=September 26, 2018|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/72jANcl1y|archivedate=September 26, 2018|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Festival International des Masques et des Arts''' (International Festival of Masks and the Arts), or '''FESTIMA''', is a cultural [[festival]] celebrating [[traditional African masks]] held in [[Dédougou]], [[Burkina Faso]].&lt;ref name=Official&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festima.org/ |title=FESTIMA |last1= |first1= |date= |website=Official FESTIMA Website |publisher= |access-date=January 11, 2018}} (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded to help preserve traditional cultural practices in the modern age, FESTIMA features masks and traditions from several [[West African]] countries.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/style/article/festima-burkina-faso/index.html |title=The masked men of Burkina Faso |last=Page |first=Thomas |date=May 13, 2016 |website=CNN |publisher= |access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is currently held [[wikt:Special:Search/biennial|biennially]] in even-numbered years.&lt;ref name=Everfest&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.everfest.com/e/festima-dedougou-burkina-faso |title=FESTIMA 2018 in Dédougou, Burkina Faso |last1= |first1= |date= |website=Everfest |publisher= |access-date=January 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next edition, the fourteenth, will be held from February 24 to March 3, 2018.&lt;ref name=Official /&gt;

==History==
In 1996, a group of Burkinabé students founded [[ASAMA]], the Association for the Protection of Masks, in order to promote and preserve traditional mask practices.&lt;ref name=Everfest /&gt;&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/10/travel/places-to-visit-music.html |title=Where Music Lovers Should Go in 2016 |last=Harris |first=Rachel Lee |date=January 8, 2016 |website=New York Times |publisher= |access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the concerns is that traditional masks are no longer a regular part of life for many. The masks' origins are religious in nature, historically being associated with [[animism]].&lt;ref name=AJ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/inpictures/2016/03/burkina-faso-festima-gathering-african-masks-160310074232928.html |title=In Burkina Faso: FESTIMA, a festival of African masks |last=Loov |first=Jacob Balzani |date=March 13, 2016 |website=Al Jazeera |publisher= |access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animism and other traditional beliefs are minority religions in modern Burkina Faso, with estimates indicating they are practiced by between 7.8&lt;ref name=Factbook&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/uv.html |title=The World Factbook |last= |first= |date=January 9, 2018 |website=CIA |publisher= |access-date=January 16, 2018}} Estimate is from 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and 15 percent&lt;ref name=DHS&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR256/FR256.pdf |title=Enquête Démographique et de Santé et à Indicateurs Multiples  |last= |first= |date=April 2012 |website=[[Demographic and Health Surveys]] |format=PDF |page=3 |publisher= |access-date=January 16, 2018}} Estimate is from 2006. (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; of the population.  The majority religion in the country is [[Islam]], which does not use the masks in their ceremonies.&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;  However, members of ASAMA believe that traditional masks can still be important culturally even to those for whom they are not important religiously.  According to Ki Leonce, executive director of ASAMA, "There are two aspects about masks. One is cult and the other is culture; there might be a religious conflict for people who venerate masks, but there is no conflict from the cultural point."&lt;ref name=AJ /&gt;

The original FESTIMA, held in 1996, was four days long, and the event has since expanded to seven days.&lt;ref name=Everfest /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yettio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yettio.com/festima-the-african-masquerade-ball/13837 |title=FESTIMA – Burkina Faso’s festival of masks |last=Sweet |first=Jonathan |date=February 17, 2016 |website=Yettio |publisher= |access-date=January 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thirteenth edition of the festival was held from February 27 to March 5, 2016, and featured masks from over 50 communities from six [[West Africa]]n countries: Burkina Faso, [[Benin]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Mali]], [[Senegal]], and [[Togo]].&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lefaso&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lefaso.net/spip.php?article69869 |title=FESTIMA 2016 : Des infrastructures pour sauvegarder les masques |last=Sawadogo |first=Tiga Cheick |date=March 1, 2016 |website=LeFaso.net |publisher= |access-date=January 11, 2018}} (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;  ASAMA estimated 100,000 people attended the event,&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt; including more than 2,000 international tourists.&lt;ref name=Lefaso /&gt;

The primary events of FESTIMA are the performances, where mask wearers dance, accompanied by musicians playing [[hand drums]], [[whistle]]s, and [[balafon]]s.&lt;ref name=Everfest /&gt;&lt;ref name=Times /&gt;  Sometimes, a translator is present to interpret the meaning of the dance.&lt;ref name=AJ /&gt;  Some of the ethnic groups whose traditions are represented are the [[Bwaba]], [[Marka people|Marka]], and [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]].&lt;ref name=CNN /&gt;

'''Geniscus''' is a deity who appears in a [[homily|sermon]] of [[Saint Eligius]] along with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], [[Orcus]], [[Minerva]] and [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]].  These are all, the [[Homiletics|Christian homilist]] says, "[[Christian demonology|demons]]" who should not be believed in or invoked.&lt;ref&gt;''Vita Eligii'' 9 (c. 700–724), ''MGH SRM'' 4: 705–706, as cited by Bernadotte Filotas, ''Pagan Survivals, Superstitions and Popular Cultures in Early Medieval Pastoral Literature'' (Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 2005), p. 78. English translation by Jo Ann McNamara of [[Audoin (bishop)|Dado of Rouen]]'s ''Life of St. Eligius of Noyon'' in ''Medieval Hagiography: An Anthology'' (Routledge, 2001), pp. 137–168, with reference to Geniscus p. 157 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDD_0GztLYkC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=Geniscus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=20#v=onepage&amp;q=Geniscus&amp;f=false online.] See also [[Mythology in the Low Countries#Saint Eligius|Mythology in the Low Countries]].&lt;/ref&gt; The warning implies [[Cult (religion)|cult]] activity for these deities in the northern parts of [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Gaul]] into the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Filotas, ''Pagan Survivals'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geniscus may be a form of reference to the [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]], the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman]] [[tutelary deity]]; in Gaul, the Genius is often hooded (''[[Genius Cucullatus]]'') and appears either singly or in a group of three.&lt;ref&gt;Filotas, ''Pagan Survivals'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another sermon in the same period, the Geniscus appears in the company of witches (''[[Strix (mythology)|striae]]'') and other entities in whom "rustics" believe:&lt;ref&gt;Filotas, ''Pagan Survivals'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|There are some country people ''(rustici homines)'' who have a belief in certain women, because it is commonly said that they must be witches and able to harm infants and cattle, and the [[Dusios|Dusiolus]] or Aquatiquus&lt;ref&gt;''Aquatiquus'' from ''aqua'', the "Watery One."&lt;/ref&gt; or Geniscus must too.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunt aliqui rustici homines, qui credunt aliquas mulieres, quod vulgum dicitur strias esse debeant, et ad infantes vel pecora nocere possint, vel Dusiolus vel Aquatiquus, vel Geniscus debeant'' as quoted by [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]] in his 1678 ''Glossarium mediae et infimae latinitatis'' (Niort: Favre, 1883–1887), vol. 4, [http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/GENISCUS online.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==19th century==
[[File:Lamia Waterhouse.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Pre-Raphaelite]] version of the ''lamia'' by [[John William Waterhouse]]]]
The 19th-century fascination for [[folklore]], [[antiquarianism]], the supernatural, and lost religions drew attention to even the obscure Geniscus. The Irish folklorist [[Thomas Crofton Croker]] accepted a [[etymology|derivation]] of ''geniscus'' from [[Latin]] ''genius'' and in his chapter on [[Elf|elves]] declared the ''geniscus'' "a real Elf, or spirit of light." Croker further connected ''geniscus'' to the ''geniciales feminae''&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Crofton Croker]], ''Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland'' (London, 1828), p. 127 [https://books.google.com/books?id=AlLI-MR1vdEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA127&amp;dq=Geniscus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Geniscus&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; named by [[Hincmar]], a 9th-century  [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|archbishop of Reims]], who identified the ''geniciales'' as ''[[Lamia (mythology)|lamiae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hincmar]], ''[[De divortio|De divortio Lotharii]]'' ("On [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothar]]'s divorce"), XV Interrogatio, ''MGH Concilia 4 Supplementum'', 205, as cited by Filotas, ''Pagan Survivals'', p. 305. In compiling his 1628 ''Glossarium'', [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]] made note of the ''geniciales feminae'', and although he appears to have associated them with words pertaining to generation and genitalia, he makes no explicit connection to Geniscus; see entry on ''geniciales feminae'' [http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/GENICIALES online.]&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period [[Jacob Grimm]] classed the ''geniciales'' among the "daemonic elvish beings, who appeared in woman's shape and did men kindnesses," and who participated in elf-dance: "To christian zealots all ''dancing'' appeared sinful and heathenish, and sure enough it often was derived from pagan rites, like other harmless pleasures and customs of the common people, who would not easily part with their diversion at great festivals." Grimm connects these dances to [[bonfires]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Grimm]] ''Teutonic Mythology'' (London, 1883), vol. 3, p. 1056 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OREVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1056&amp;dq=geniciales+Hincmar+OR+Hincmarus+OR+Hincmar&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=geniciales%20Hincmar%20OR%20Hincmarus%20OR%20Hincmar&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geniscus is mentioned in the 1876 [[historical fiction]] ''Dante and Beatrice from 1282 to 1290: A Romance'' by [[Elizabeth Kerr Coulson]], writing under the pseudonym Roxburghe Lothian. Coulson recounts at length the Christian prohibitions that a [[friar]] called [[Hermit|The Hermit]] must enforce, then segues into practices deemed tolerable:

{{cquote|He had to stop people from keeping the day of rats and mice;&lt;ref&gt;This reference requires elucidation; perhaps Coulson means the [[Normandy|Norman]] agricultural rite when animals injurious to crops were exorcized during the season of [[Advent]]; children brandished torches through the fields and chanted ''Mice, caterpillars and moles, / Get out, get out of my field; / I will burn you beard and bones. / Trees and shrubs, / Give me bushels of apples''; see ''Encyclopaedia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences of the World'' (Chicago, 1903), vol. 3, p. 1479 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ns0gK0efOvYC&amp;pg=PA1479&amp;dq=%22In+Normandy,+it+was+formerly+the+custom%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22In%20Normandy%2C%20it%20was%20formerly%20the%20custom%22&amp;f=false  online.] But this is conjecture, and a number of other rites or occasions may be meant; the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin]] may also come to mind.&lt;/ref&gt; a day which, with many similar remnants of [[paganism]], the [[Christian Church|Church]] had forbidden, although she had been pleased to appoint Saint [[Gertrude of Nivelles|Gertrude of Nivelle]], as the [[patron saint|patroness]] of their destruction. He was also bound to decry the old [[wikt:reverence|reverence]] for [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash trees]],&lt;ref&gt;See also [[World tree]], [[Tree of life]], [[Maypole]], [[Tree worship]], [[Yggdrasil]], [[Thor's oak]], [[Irminsul]], and [[Sacred tree at Uppsala]].&lt;/ref&gt; which reverence was a relic of the [[Midsummer|pagan Solstitia]]. He would tolerate no [[St John's Eve#Ireland|June fires]], on the [[St John's Eve|even of St John]], neither any dancing around them. But, on the other hand, there were minor customs of the lowliest of the poor which he tolerated. Such were the lighting of small [[wikt:cresset|cressets]] to float on streams and fountains, to prevent their drying up (which same were of old offerings to the [[Naiads]] and [[Potamides (mythology)|Potamides]]&lt;ref&gt;Daughters of [[wikt:ποταμός|Potamus]] ("River").&lt;/ref&gt;); hanging of wreaths of [[Verbena#Vervains in human culture|vervain]] round the necks of beasts to keep [[Vipera berus|adder]]s from them; placing of sprigs of [[buxus|box]] over cottage doors; wearing pieces of [[amber]] for Minerva, and strange [[amulet]]s against Ouragus,&lt;ref&gt;Coulson's source for this form of the [[theonym]] Orcus is unclear.&lt;/ref&gt; the old god of death, and his helper '''Geniscus'''; treasuring of red pebbles, found in the marsh-lands, in [[Lapwing|lap-wings]]' nests. These, and many more customs of the same kind, he found ineradicable, and was fain to tolerate patiently.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Kerr Coulson]] writing as Roxburghe Lothian, ''Dante and Beatrice from 1282 to 1290: A Romance'' (London, 1876), vol. 1, pp. 117–118; full text [https://books.google.com/books?id=4voBAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:Elizabeth+inauthor:Kerr+inauthor:Coulson&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=1&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false downloadable.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Whether she used the ''Vita'' of St. Eligius directly or another source such as Croker, Coulson preserves the collocation of Geniscus with Minerva and Orcus (here Ouragus&lt;ref&gt;This is a rather learned allusion on the part of the author, as ''Uragus'' is a form given by [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] as the original from which Orcus derived; see ''Actes del IXè Simposi de la Secció Catalana de la SEEC St. Feliu de Guíxols, 13–16 d'abril de 1988: Treballs en honor de Virgilio Bejarano'' (Barcelona, 1991), p. 186 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2WdGEJF3A2YC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=%22Orcus+proviene+de+Uragus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Orcus%20proviene%20de%20Uragus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;). She either innovates or draws on traditions pertaining to the cult of the ''Genii'' by making Geniscus the "helper" of Orcus.

'''''Girl with Ball''''' is a 1961 painting by [[Roy Lichtenstein]]. It is an oil on canvas [[Pop art]] work that is now in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], after being owned for several decades by [[Philip Johnson]]. It is one of Lichtenstein's earliest Pop art works and is known for its source, which is a newspaper ad that ran for several decades and which was among Lichtenstein's earliest works sourced from pop culture.

''Girl with Ball'' was exhibited at Lichtenstein's first solo exhibition and was displayed in ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'s}} review of the show. This work significantly alters the original source and is considered exemplary of Lichtenstein's works that exaggerate the mechanically produced appearance although the result of his painterly work. It is an enduring depiction of the contemporary beauty figure.

==Background==
[[File:Girl with Ball source.jpg|thumb|left|The source of ''Girl with Ball'' was a common advertisement image.]]
''Girl with Ball'' was inspired by a 1961 advertisement for the [[Mount Airy Lodge]] in the [[Pocono Mountains]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Modern Art and Popular Culture: Readings in High &amp; Low|publisher=[[Museum of Modern Art]] and [[Harry N. Abrams, Inc.]]|editor=[[Kirk Varnedoe|Varnedoe, Kirk]] and Adam Gopink|year=1990|isbn=0-8109-2466-8|chapter=Illustrations (numbers 220 &amp; 221)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad, which started running in 1955, was widely published in the [[New York metropolitan area]] and elsewhere, including several prominent newspapers such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Waldman|page=55|chapter=Comic Strips and Advertising Images}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisement was still running in newspapers more than twenty years after Lichtenstein produced the work.&lt;ref name=RLLA&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|last=Alloway |first=Lawrence |author-link=Lawrence Alloway|isbn=0-89659-331-2|publisher=[[Abbeville Press]]|year=1983|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Lichtenstein Foundation website, in autumn 1961, a fellow teacher at [[Rutgers University]] named [[Allan Kaprow]] made introductions between Lichtenstein and [[Leo Castelli]] Gallery director [[Ivan Karp]]. Lichtenstein showed Karp several paintings including ''Girl with Ball'', which was the one that intrigued Karp. Karp agreed to represent Lichtenstein weeks later. After showing the painting to [[Andy Warhol]], he sold it to architect [[Philip Johnson]] that November. The painting appeared in ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'s}} 1962 review of Lichtenstein's Castelli Gallery show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/frames.htm|title=Chronology|accessdate=May 9, 2012|publisher=Roy Lichtenstein Foundation|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507132503/http://www.lichtensteinfoundation.org/frames.htm|archivedate=May 7, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work appeared in the April 3, 1963 "Pop! Goes the Easel" show at the [[Contemporary Arts Museum Houston]] along with his ''Brattata'' (1962) and ''Head-Red and Yellow'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: An International Perspective|editor=Livingstone, Marco|year=1991|isbn=0-8478-1475-0|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications, Inc.|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''Girl with Ball'' depicts a woman wearing a bathing suit holding a beach ball with red stripes in the same color as her lips and tongue.&lt;ref name=RLLA/&gt; Lichtenstein used a painter's version of [[comic strip]] artist techniques to create his own rendition of the subject of a nostalgic photograph, resulting in a simplified work of art with its own appeal. He produced the work using [[Ben-Day dots]] of [[primary color]]s. The process is described as exaggerating the "limitations of mechanical reproduction" to strip the photograph of its polish in a startling and intense form. In 1961, this painting was groundbreaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Museum of Modern Art, MoMA Highlights|location=New York|publisher=The Museum of Modern Art|origyear=1999|year=2004|page=238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facial features such as nose and mouth are depicted using "commercial shorthand".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein: Classic of the New|editor=Schneider, Eckhard|publisher=[[Kunsthaus Bregenz]]|year=2005|isbn=3-88375-965-1|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His process of reworking original artwork is described as "abstraction by subtraction", in which all features of the original are reduced to simple graphic elements.&lt;ref&gt;Coplans, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Lichtenstein alters the planar position of the subject of the picture to position her "nearer to the picture plane". He drew the picture more distorted than might be expected of a cartoonist by augmenting and focusing on her two-dimensionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|author=Waldman, Diane|pages=49–55|publisher=[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]|year=1993|isbn=0-89207-108-7|chapter=Comic Strips and Advertising Images}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The image and technique were regarded as unartistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pop Art: A Continuing History|author=Livingstone, Marco|publisher=[[Thames and Hudson]]|isbn=0-500-28240-4|year=2000|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the painting presented an allusion to printing technology, with its Ben-Day dots, and to art history, with its "[[Art Nouveau]] forms". Though "crude and simplistic" the work demonstrates artistic intellect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Meanings of Modern Art|last=Russell |first=John |author-link=John Russell (art critic) |publisher=[[Harper &amp; Row, Publishers]]|isbn=0-06-013701-0|page=346|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Girl with Ball'' is described by Diane Waldman as "striking" in the simple and bold way it presents a vacation atmosphere. She notes it is "reminiscent of [[Picasso]]'s frolicking bather in one of his paintings on the subject, ''Bather with Beach Ball'' (fig. 48), 1932," especially in the way Lichtenstein has scaled down the representation and the way he depicts movement.&lt;ref name="RLDW55"/&gt;

The newspaper ad source provided Lichtenstein with "one of the most common tropes of the day for the image of a woman." The updated [[Betty Grable]]-type subject, was a fashionable glamor figure that Lichtenstein used for a symbolic value that ranks her with "iconoclastic female figures, including [[Manet]]'s ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'', 1863, [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]]'s ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', 1907 and [[Willem de Kooning|de Kooning]]'s three series of ''[[Woman III|Women]]''".&lt;ref name=RLDW55&gt;{{cite book|title=Roy Lichtenstein|author=Waldman, Diane|page=55|publisher=[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]|year=1993|isbn=0-89207-108-7|chapter=Comic Strips and Advertising Images}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Goldilocks and the Three Bears'''" (originally titled "'''The Story of the Three Bears'''") is a 19th-century [[fairy tale]] of which three versions exist. The original version of the tale tells of a badly-behaved old woman who enters the forest home of three [[bachelor]] bears whilst they are away. She sits in their chairs, eats some of their [[porridge]], and sleeps in one of their beds. When the bears return and discover her, she wakes up, jumps out of the window, and is never seen again. The second version replaced the old woman with a little girl named Goldilocks, and the third and by far most well-known version replaced the original bear trio with Papa Bear, Mama Bear and Baby Bear.

What was originally a frightening oral tale became a cozy family story with only a hint of menace. The story has elicited various interpretations and has been adapted to film, opera, and other media. "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" is one of the most popular fairy tales in the English language.&lt;ref name="Elms257"&gt;Elms 1977, p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In [[Robert Southey|Southey's]] tale, three [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] bears &amp;ndash; "a little, small, wee bear, a middle-sized bear, and a great, huge bear" &amp;ndash; live together in a house in the woods. Southey describes them as very good-natured, trusting, harmless, tidy, and hospitable. Each of these "bachelor" bears has his own [[porridge]] bowl, chair, and bed. One day they make porridge for breakfast, but it's too hot to eat, so they take a walk in the woods while their porridge cools. An old woman approaches the bears' house. As she has been sent out by her family, she is a disgrace to them. She is impudent, bad, foul-mouthed, ugly, dirty, and a vagrant deserving of a stint in the [[House of Correction]]. She looks through a window, peeps through the keyhole, and lifts the latch. Assured that no one is home, she walks in. The old woman eats the Wee Bear's porridge, then settles into his chair and breaks it. Prowling about, she finds the bears' beds and falls asleep in Wee Bear's bed. The dark end of the tale is reached when the bears return. Wee Bear finds his empty bowl, his broken chair, and the old woman sleeping in his bed and cries, "Somebody has been lying in my bed, and here she is!" The old woman wakes, jumps out the window and is never seen again.

==Origins==
[[File:Robert Southey - Project Gutenberg eText 13619.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Robert Southey]]

The story was first recorded in narrative form by British writer and poet [[Robert Southey]], and first published anonymously as "The Story of the Three Bears" in 1837 in a volume of his writings called ''The Doctor''.&lt;ref name="Tatar245"&gt;Tatar 2002, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt; The same year Southey's tale was published, the story was versified by [[George Nicol (bookseller)|George Nicol]], who acknowledged the anonymous author of ''The Doctor'' as "the great, original concocter" of the tale.&lt;ref name="Opie199"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ober 1981, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Southey was delighted with Nicol's effort to bring more exposure to the tale, concerned children might overlook it in ''The Doctor''.&lt;ref name="Curry"&gt;Curry 1921, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Nicol's version was illustrated with engravings by [[B. Hart]] (after "C.J."), and was reissued in 1848 with Southey identified as the story's author.&lt;ref name="Ober48"&gt;Ober 1981, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of the three bears was in circulation before the publication of Southey's tale.&lt;ref name="Dorson"&gt;Dorson 2001, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; In 1813, for example, Southey was telling the story to friends, and in 1831 [[Eleanor Mure]] fashioned a handmade booklet about the three bears and the old woman for her nephew Horace Broke's birthday.&lt;ref name="Opie199"/&gt; Southey and Mure differ in details. Southey's bears have porridge, but Mure's have milk;&lt;ref name="Opie199"&gt;Opie 1992, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; Southey's old woman has no motive for entering the house, but Mure's old woman is piqued when her courtesy visit is rebuffed;&lt;ref&gt;Ober 1981, pp. 2,10&lt;/ref&gt; Southey's old woman runs away when discovered, but Mure's old woman is impaled on the steeple of [[St Paul's Cathedral]].&lt;ref name="Opie199200"&gt;Opie 1992, pp. 199&amp;ndash;200&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklorists [[Iona and Peter Opie|Iona]] and [[Iona and Peter Opie|Peter Opie]] point out in ''The Classic Fairy Tales'' (1999) that the tale has a "partial analogue" in "[[Snow White]]": the lost princess enters the dwarfs' house, tastes their food, and falls asleep in one of their beds. In a manner similar to the three bears, the dwarfs cry, "Someone's been sitting in my chair!", "Someone's been eating off my plate!", and "Someone's been sleeping in my bed!" The Opies also point to similarities in a Norwegian tale about a princess who takes refuge in a cave inhabited by three Russian princes dressed in bearskins. She eats their food and hides under a bed.&lt;ref name="Opie200"&gt;Opie 1992, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865, [[Charles Dickens]] referenced a similar tale in ''[[Our Mutual Friend]]'', but in that story the house belongs to [[hobgoblin]]s rather than bears. Dickens' reference however suggests a yet-to-be-discovered analogue or source.&lt;ref name="Oberxii"&gt;Ober 1981, p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; Hunting rituals and ceremonies have been suggested and dismissed as possible origins.&lt;ref name="Oberx"&gt;Ober 1981, p. x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elms259"&gt;Elms 1977, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, "Scrapefoot", a tale with a fox as antagonist that bears striking similarities to Southey's story, was uncovered by the folklorist [[Joseph Jacobs]] and may predate Southey's version in the [[oral tradition]].  Some sources state that it was illustrator [[John D. Batten]] who in 1894 reported a variant of the tale at least 40 years old. In this version, the three bears live in a castle in the woods and are visited by a fox called Scrapefoot who drinks their milk, sits in their chairs, and rests in their beds.&lt;ref name="Opie199"/&gt; This version belongs to the early Fox and Bear tale-cycle.&lt;ref name="Briggs2"/&gt; Southey possibly heard "Scrapefoot", and confused its "vixen" with a synonym for an unpleasant malicious old woman. Some maintain however that the story as well as the old woman originated with Southey.&lt;ref name="Tatar245"/&gt;

Southey most likely learned the tale as a child from his uncle William Tyler. Uncle Tyler may have told a version with a vixen (female fox) as the intruder, and then Southey may have later confused "vixen" with another common meaning of "a crafty old woman".&lt;ref name="Opie199"/&gt; P. M. Zall writes in "The Gothic Voice of Father Bear" (1974) that "it was no trick for Southey, a consummate technician, to recreate the improvisational tone of an Uncle William through rhythmical reiteration, artful alliteration ('they walked into the woods, while'), even bardic interpolation ('She could not have been a good, honest Old Woman')".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in: Ober 1981, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, it is uncertain where Southey or his uncle learned the tale.

==Later variations: Goldilocks==
Twelve years after the publication of Southey's tale, [[Joseph Cundall]] transformed the antagonist from an ugly old woman to a pretty little girl in his ''Treasury of Pleasure Books for Young Children''. He explained his reasons for doing so in a dedicatory letter to his children, dated November 1849, which was inserted at the beginning of the book:
{{quote|The "Story of the Three Bears" is a very old Nursery Tale, but it was never so well told as by the great poet Southey, whose version I have (with permission) given you, only I have made the intruder a little girl instead of an old woman. This I did because I found that the tale is better known with ''Silver-Hair'', and because there are so many other stories of old women.&lt;ref name="Opie200"/&gt;}}

Once the little girl entered the tale, she remained – suggesting children prefer an attractive child in the story rather than an ugly old woman.&lt;ref name="Curry" /&gt; The juvenile antagonist saw a succession of names:&lt;ref name="Seal"&gt;Seal 2001, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Silver Hair in the pantomime ''Harlequin and The Three Bears; or, Little Silver Hair and the Fairies'' by [[John Baldwin Buckstone|J. B. Buckstone]] (1853); Silver-Locks in ''Aunt Mavor's Nursery Tales'' (1858); Silverhair in [[George MacDonald]]'s "The Golden Key" (1867); Golden Hair in ''Aunt Friendly's Nursery Book'' (ca. 1868);&lt;ref name="Opie200" /&gt; Silver-Hair and Goldenlocks at various times; Little Golden-Hair (1889);&lt;ref name="Briggs2"&gt;Briggs 2002, pp. 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; and finally Goldilocks in ''Old Nursery Stories and Rhymes'' (1904).&lt;ref name="Opie200"/&gt; Tatar credits [[Flora Annie Steel]] with naming the child (1918).&lt;ref name="Tatar245"/&gt;

[[File:The Story of the Three Bears pg 25.jpg|thumb|180px|left|alt=three bears overlook a bed as a scared girl leaps from the bed|Goldilocks caught in Baby Bear's bed – by [[Leonard Leslie Brooke]]]]

Goldilocks's fate varies in the many retellings: in some versions, she runs into the forest, in some she is almost eaten by the bears but her mother rescues her, in some she vows to be a good child, and in some she returns home. Whatever her fate, Goldilocks fares better than Southey's vagrant old woman who, in his opinion, deserved a stint in the House of Correction, and far better than Miss Mure's old woman who is impaled upon a steeple in [[St Paul's Cathedral, London|St Paul's]] church-yard.&lt;ref name="Tatar246"&gt;Tatar 2002, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Southey's all-male ursine trio has not been left untouched over the years. The group was re-cast as Papa, Mama, and Baby Bear, but the date of this change is disputed. Tatar indicates it occurred by 1852,&lt;ref name="Tatar246"/&gt; while Katherine Briggs suggests the event occurred in 1878 with ''[[Mother Goose|Mother Goose's Fairy Tales]]'' published by Routledge.&lt;ref name="Briggs2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seal"/&gt; With the publication of the tale by "Aunt Fanny" in 1852, the bears became a family in the ''illustrations'' to the tale but remained three bachelor bears in the text.

In Dulcken's version of 1858, the two larger bears are brother and sister, and friends to the little bear. This arrangement represents the evolution of the ursine trio from the traditional three male bears to a family of father, mother, and child.&lt;ref&gt;Ober 1981, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; In a publication ca. 1860, the bears have become a family at last in both text and illustrations: "the old papa bear, the mama bear, and the little boy bear".&lt;ref&gt;Ober 1981, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; In a Routledge publication ''c''&amp;nbsp;1867, Papa Bear is called Rough Bruin, Mama Bear is Mammy Muff, and Baby Bear is called Tiny. Inexplicably, the illustrations depict the three as male bears.&lt;ref&gt;Ober 1981, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

In publications subsequent to Aunt Fanny's of 1852, Victorian nicety required editors to routinely and silently alter Southey's "[T]here she sate till the bottom of the chair came out, and down came her's, plump upon the ground" to read "and down she came", omitting any reference to the human bottom. The cumulative effect of the several changes to the tale since its original publication was to transform a fearsome oral tale into a cozy family story with an unrealised hint of menace.&lt;ref name="Seal"/&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[Maria Tatar]], in ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'' (2002), notes that Southey's tale is sometimes viewed as a cautionary tale that imparts a lesson about the hazards of wandering off and exploring unknown territory. Like "[[Three Little Pigs|The Tale of the Three Little Pigs]]", the story uses repetitive formulas to engage the child's attention and to reinforce the point about safety and shelter.&lt;ref name="Tatar246"/&gt; Tatar points out that the tale is typically framed today as a discovery of what is "just right", but for earlier generations, it was a tale about an intruder who could not control herself when encountering the possessions of others.&lt;ref name="Tatar251"&gt;Tatar 2002, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goldilocks Batten 1890.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Illustration by John Batten, 1890]]

In ''[[The Uses of Enchantment]]'' (1976), the child psychologist [[Bruno Bettelheim]] describes Goldilocks as "poor, beautiful, and charming", and notes that the story does not describe her positively except for her hair.&lt;ref name="Elms264"&gt;Elms 1977, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Bettelheim mainly discussed the tale in terms of Goldilocks' struggle to move past [[Oedipus complex|Oedipal issues]] to confront adolescent identity problems.&lt;ref name="Schultz93"/&gt;

In Bettelheim's view, the tale fails to encourage children "to pursue the hard labor of solving, one at a time, the problems which growing up presents", and does not end as fairy tales should with the "promise of future happiness awaiting those who have mastered their Oedipal situation as a child". He believes the tale is an escapist one that thwarts the child reading it from gaining emotional maturity.

Tatar criticises Bettelheim's views: "[His] reading is perhaps too invested in instrumentalizing fairy tales, that is, in turning them into vehicles that convey messages and set forth behavioral models for the child. While the story may not solve oedipal issues or sibling rivalry as Bettelheim believes "[[Cinderella]]" does, it suggests the importance of respecting property and the consequences of just 'trying out' things that do not belong to you."&lt;ref name="Tatar246"/&gt;

Elms suggests Bettelheim may have missed the [[Anal stage|anal aspect]] of the tale that would make it helpful to the child's personality development.&lt;ref name="Elms264"/&gt; In ''Handbook of Psychobiography'' Elms describes Southey's tale not as one of Bettelheimian post-Oedipal ego development but as one of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] pre-Oedipal anality.&lt;ref name="Schultz93"/&gt; He believes the story appeals chiefly to preschoolers who are engaged in "cleanliness training, maintaining environmental and behavioral order, and distress about disruption of order". His own experience and his observation of others lead him to believe children align themselves with the tidy, organised ursine protagonists rather than the unruly, delinquent human antagonist. In Elms's view, the anality of "The Story of the Three Bears" can be traced directly to Robert Southey's fastidious, dirt-obsessed aunt who raised him and passed her obsession to him in a milder form.&lt;ref name="Schultz93"&gt;Schultz 2005, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary elements==
The story makes extensive use of the literary [[Rule of three (writing)|rule of three]], featuring three chairs, three bowls of porridge, three beds, and the three title characters who live in the house. There are also three sequences of the bears discovering in turn that someone has been eating from their porridge, sitting in their chairs, and finally, lying in their beds, at which point is the climax of Goldilocks being discovered. This follows three earlier sequences of Goldilocks trying the bowls of porridge, chairs, and beds successively, each time finding the third "just right". Author [[Christopher Booker]] characterises this as the "dialectical three", where "the first is wrong in one way, the second in another or opposite way, and only the third, in the middle, is just right". Booker continues: "This idea that the way forward lies in finding an exact middle path between opposites is of extraordinary importance in storytelling".&lt;ref&gt;Booker 2005, pp. 229–32&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has spread across many other disciplines, particularly developmental psychology, biology, economics and engineering where it is called the "[[Goldilocks principle]]". In planetary astronomy, a planet orbiting its sun at just the right distance for liquid water to exist on its surface, neither too hot nor too cold, is referred to as being in the 'Goldilocks Zone'.

== Adaptations ==
* Songwriter [[Bobby Troup]]'s [[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]] interpretation titled "The Three Bears", first recorded by [[Page Cavanaugh]] in 1946, is often erroneously credited to "anonymous" and re-titled "Three Bears Rap", "Three Bears with a Beat", etc.
* [[Kurt Schwertsik]]'s 35-minute opera ''[[Roald Dahl]]'s Goldilocks'' premiered in 1997 at the [[Glasgow Royal Concert Hall]]. The opera's setting is the Forest Assizes where Baby Bear stands accused of assaulting Miss Goldie Locks. The tables are turned when the defence limns the trauma suffered by the bears at the hands of that "brazen little crook", Goldilocks.&lt;ref&gt;''Roald Dahl's Goldilocks''&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Rooster Teeth Productions]] ''[[RWBY]]'', Yang Xiao Long is a carefree, reckless yellow-haired girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Webb|first=Charles|title=EXCLUSIVE: Rooster Teeth's 'RWBY' Yellow Trailer|url=http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2013/06/01/exclusive-rooster-teeths-rwby-yellow-trailer/|accessdate=10 June 2013|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=1 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130609232919/http://multiplayerblog.mtv.com/2013/06/01/exclusive-rooster-teeths-rwby-yellow-trailer/|archivedate=9 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a "rule-breaker" who likes teddy bears. She is an allusion to Goldilocks which is reflected in her name, translated from Chinese as "sun", referring to the colour yellow.&lt;ref name="anime"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rush|first=Amanda|title=FEATURE: Inside Rooster Teeth's "RWBY"|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/07/12/feature-inside-rooster-teeths-rwby|publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=18 July 2013|date=12 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in her trailer, Yang confronts Hei "Junior" Xiong, whose name is Chinese for "black bear." Combining this with his nickname, he alludes to the Baby Bear.
* The TV show ''[[Happily Ever After: Fairy Tales for Every Child]]'' featured an adaption of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears" in a Jamaican setting which featured the voices of [[Raven-Symoné]] as Goldilocks, [[Tone Loc]] as Desmond Bear, [[Alfre Woodard]] as Winsone Bear, and [[David Alan Grier]] as Dudley Bear.
* In an episode of ''[[Sesame Street]]'', a reversed version of the story titled ''[[Bear Family|Baby Bear]] and the Three Goldilocks'' was told (and written) by Telly and [[Elmo]].
* The television show ''[[Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater]]'' Kittylocks and the Three Bears is an adaptation of the story.
* "Goldilocks Eats Grits" has the bears living in a cave in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uexpress.com/tell-me-a-story/2015/1/25/goldilocks-eats-grits-a-fairytale|title=Goldilocks Eats Grits|first1=Amy|last1=Friedman|first2=Meredith|last2=Johnson|publisher=[[Universal Uclick]]|date=25 January 2015|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A commercial for the 2005 Hummer portrayed the Three Bears returning from a family trip to their very upscale home to discover all the elements of the traditional story. They race to their garage to check on the status of the family Hummers. Mama Bear and Papa Bear are relieved that both vehicles are still in place, but Baby Bear is distraught to find his missing as the camera cuts away to Goldilocks (in this version portrayed by a very attractive young woman) rakishly smiling as she makes her getaway in Baby Bear's Hummer down a scenic mountain road.  
* In 2016, professional wrestler [[Bray Wyatt]] read a dark version to [[Edge and Christian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm1WfZwMuN8 |title=Bray Wyatt tells a twisted fairy tale on the Edge &amp; Christian Show, only on WWE Network |quote=Bray Wyatt puts a diabolical spin on 'Goldilocks and the Three Bears' on The Edge &amp; Christian Show |date=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Disney Junior's ''[[Goldie &amp; Bear]]'' premiered in 2016. The tale is set after the events of the story where Goldilocks (voiced by [[Natalie Lander]]) and Jack Bear (voiced by [[Georgie Kidder]]) eventually became best friends.

The '''history of radio disc jockeys''' covers the time when gramophone records were first transmitted by experimental [[radio broadcasting|radio]] broadcasters to present day [[radio personality|radio personalities]] who host shows featuring a variety of recorded music.

For a number of decades beginning in the 1930s, the term "disc [[jockey]]", "DJ", "deejay", or "jock"&lt;ref name="Keith2006"&gt;Michael C Keith.

The term "disc jockey" first appeared in print in a 1941 issue of [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'' magazine]],&lt;ref name="Fong-Torres2001"&gt;Ben Fong-Torres.

The term combined "disc", referring to phonograph disc records, and "jockey", denoting the DJs practice of riding the audio gain, or alternately, riding a song to success and popularity.&lt;ref name="Shepherd2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Shepherd|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: VolumeII: Performance and Production|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pJvzEzjahkQC&amp;pg=PA187|date=8 July 2003|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-0-8264-6322-7|pages=187–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culminating in the "golden age" of [[Top 40]] radio, from approximately 1955 to 1975, radio DJs established a style of fast talking [[patter]] to bookend three minute pop songs.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weingarten|first1=Markk|title=Radio Patter From the Past: Vintage D.J.'s Rock On|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/09/technology/radio-patter-from-the-past-vintage-dj-s-rock-on.html|website=[[New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the modern [[disc jockey|club DJ]] who mixes transitions between songs to create a continuous flow of music, radio DJs played individual [[songs]] or [[Album#Music track|music tracks]] while voicing announcements, introductions, comments, jokes, and commercials in between each song or short series of songs.&lt;ref name="Higgins"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Higgins|first1=Terry|title=Club Features New Breed of Disc Jockey|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&amp;dat=19840629&amp;id=hoFQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OhIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5730,6226527&amp;hl=en|website=Milwaukee Sentinel|publisher=Milwaukee Sentinel, June 29, 1984|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, 60s and 70s, radio DJs exerted considerable influence on popular music, especially during the [[Top 40 radio]] era, because of their ability to introduce new music to the radio audience and promote or control which songs would be given airplay.&lt;ref name="NYTBooks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Battaglio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Battaglio|first1=Stephen|title=Television/Radio; When AM Ruled Music, and WABC Was King|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/10/arts/television-radio-when-am-ruled-music-and-wabc-was-king.html?pagewanted=all|website=New York Times|publisher=New York Times Company|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, [[Emile Berliner]] began commercial production of his [[gramophone record]]s, the first disc records to be offered to the public. The earliest broadcasts of recorded music were made by radio engineers and experimenters. On Christmas Eve 1906, American [[Reginald A. Fessenden]] broadcast both live and recorded music from Brant Rock, Massachusetts. In 1907, American inventor Lee DeForest broadcast a recording of the [[William Tell Overture]] from his laboratory in the Parker Building in New York City, claiming "Of course, there weren't many receivers in those days, but I was the first disc jockey".&lt;ref name="NYTBooks"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Udovitch|first1=Mim|title=Last Night a DJ Saved My Life The History of the Disc Jockey By BILL BREWSTER and FRANK BROUGHTON Grove Press|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/brewster-dj.html|website=New York Times Book Review|publisher=New York Times Company|accessdate=8 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray Newby, of Stockton, California claimed on a 1965 episode of [[CBS]] ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'' to be regularly playing records on a small transmitter while a student at Herrold College of Engineering and Wireless in [[San Jose, California]] in 1909.&lt;ref name="Secret"&gt;Ray Newby appearance on [[CBS]]' ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', 27 September 1965.

By 1910, radio broadcasters had started to use "live" orchestras as well as prerecorded sound. In the early radio age, content typically included comedy, drama, news, music, and sports reporting. Most radio stations had an orchestra or band on the payroll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americahurrah.com/NBC/RadioCity.htm |title=NBC's Radio City, San Francisco|author=Roddy, Bill|publisher=Roddy, Bill|accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richsamuels.com/nbcmm/joeg.html |title=The NBC Chicago Orchestra|author=Samuels, Rich|publisher=Samuels, Rich|accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Communications Commission]] also clearly favored live music, providing accelerated license approval to stations promising not to use any recordings for their first three years on the air.&lt;ref name=Fisher/&gt; Many noted recording artists tried to keep their recorded works off the air by having their records labeled as not being legal for airplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keep Your Big Mouth Shut ..Disc Jockeys Learn To Toil And Spin|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19550623&amp;id=8w5WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZOIDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4803,3719255|accessdate=29 December 2013|newspaper=Eugene Register-Guard|date=23 June 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took a Federal court ruling in 1940 to establish that a recording artist had no legal right to control the use of a record after it was sold.&lt;ref name=Fisher/&gt;

Elman B. Meyers started broadcasting a daily program in New York City in 1911 consisting mostly of recorded music. In 1914 his wife Sybil True broadcast records borrowed from a local music store. The first [[British people|British]] DJ was Christopher Stone, who in 1927 convinced the [[BBC]] to let him broadcast a program consisting of American and American-influenced jazz records interspersed with his [[ad lib]]bed introductions.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

One of the first women disc jockeys was Halloween Martin. She was on [[WBBM (AM)]] in Chicago as early as 1929, hosting a morning program she called the "Musical Clock." She played up-beat songs, gave the time and temperature, and read the latest weather.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Connolly.

[[File:Martin_block_stan_kenton_wnewedited.jpg|thumb|upright|DJ Martin Block with [[Stan Kenton]].]]
In 1935, American radio commentator [[Walter Winchell]] used the term "disc jockey" (the combination of ''disc'', referring to the disc records, and ''jockey'', which is an operator of a machine) as a description of radio announcer [[Martin Block]], the first announcer to become a star. While his audience was awaiting developments in the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], Block played records and created the illusion that he was broadcasting from a ballroom, with the nation’s top dance bands performing live. The show, which he called ''Make Believe Ballroom'', was an instant hit.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = Marc | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Something in the Air | publisher = Random House | date = | location = | pages = 11| url = | doi = | isbn = 978-0-375-50907-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Block was notable for his considerable influence on a records popularity. Block's program on station WNEW was highly successful, and Block was described as "the make-all, break-all of records. If he played something, it was a hit". Block later negotiated a multimillion-dollar contract with [[ABC Radio (United States)|ABC]] for a syndicated nationwide radio show.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

The earliest printed use of the term "disc jockey" appeared on August 13, 1941 when [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] published "... Gilbert is a disc jockey, who sings with his records." By the end of World War II, disc jockeys had established a reputation as "hitmakers", someone whose influence "could start an artist's career overnight".&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brewster|first1=Bill|last2=Broughton|first2=Frank|title=Last Night a DJ Saved My Life - The History of the Disc Jockey|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/brewster-dj.html|website=New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disputes with the [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) and the [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM) affected radio DJs during World War II. ASCAP and AFM cited the decline in demand for live appearances of musical artists due to the proliferation of radio disc jockeys playing recorded music. The disputes were settled in 1944.&lt;ref name="britannica.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Disc jockey - Radio personality|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/disc-jockey|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=britannica.com|accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The postwar period coincided with the rise of the radio disc jockey as a celebrity separate from the radio station, also known as a "radio personality". In the days before station-controlled playlists, the DJ often followed their personal tastes in music selection. DJs also played a role in exposing rock and roll artists to large, national audiences.

While at [[WJMO|WERE (1300&amp;nbsp;AM)]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], DJ [[Bill Randle]] was one of the first to introduce [[Elvis Presley]] to radio audiences in the northeastern U.S.&lt;ref name="Curtis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Curtis|first=James M. |title=Rock eras: interpretations of music and society, 1954-1984|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F0xAUXaBYqoC&amp;pg=PA42&amp;dq=disc+jockey#v=onepage&amp;q=disc%20jockey&amp;f=false|year=1987|publisher=Popular Press|isbn=978-0-87972-369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[WMCA (AM)]], DJ [[Jack Spector]] was the first New York City radio personality to play the new [[The Beatles|Beatles']] Capitol Records' single, "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spizer|first=Bruce|title=The Beatles Are Coming!|year=2003|publisher=498 Publications|location=New Orleans|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A top-rated radio host at [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] in New York City in the mid 1960s was Murray Kaufman, aka [[Murray the K]]. Kaufman took over the station's 7-11PM time period for several years. His show was known for its frenetic pace that incorporated segues, jingles, sound effects, and antics. After being invited by Beatles manager [[Brian Epstein]] to travel with the band, he came to be referred to as the "[[Fifth Beatle]]".&lt;ref name="RHOF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Murray "The K" Kaufman|url=http://www.radiohof.org/murray_kaufman.htm|website=Radio Hall of Fame|publisher=National Radio Hall Of Fame}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable [[United States|U.S.]] radio disc jockeys of the period include [[Alan Freed]], [[Wolfman Jack]], [[Casey Kasem]],&lt;ref name="SissonZacher2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Sisson|author2=Christian K.

[[File:AlanFreed-WinsNewYork-March231955.ogg|thumb|left|Radio DJ [[Alan Freed]] on New York City's [[WINS (AM)]] in 1955.]]
Alan Freed is commonly referred to as the "father of rock and roll" due to his promotion of the music and his introduction of the term [[rock and roll]] on radio in the early 1950s. Freed also made a practice of presenting music by African-American artists rather than cover versions by white artists on his radio program. Freed's career ended when it was shown that he had accepted [[payola]], a practice that was highly controversial at the time, resulting in his being fired from his job at [[WABC (AM)|WABC]].&lt;ref name="Altschuler2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Glenn C. Altschuler|title=All shook up: how rock 'n' roll changed America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMyC2FndXwkC&amp;pg=PA152|accessdate=13 October 2011|date=16 July 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513943-3|pages=152–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John R.]] (aka John Richbourg) listened to African-American DJ's on their programs talking the street patter and mimicked them. Richbourg's practice of using speech that simulated African-American street language of the mid-twentieth century led to [[WLAC]] programming an entire cohort of white DJ's that spoke like blacks did while playing music that was popular in the black community. This re-invigorated the station, and it stuck with not identifying the announcers until the mid-sixties. By then the rebellious youth market made the nightly rhythm and blues station the one they tuned to for rock and roll, as atmospherics carried the signal enabling the station to be heard throughout much of the [[North American]] continent and [[Caribbean]] islands.

[[File:Wolfman Jack in 1979.jpg|thumb|upright|Wolfman Jack]]
Bob Smith (aka Wolfman Jack) began his career as an announcer on [[XERF]] located in Mexico and became an influential DJ who advocated for African American music on his long running rock and roll radio show. Many people thought Smith was a black DJ until he appeared as himself in the 1973 film [[American Graffiti]]. Smith hosted TV shows such as ''Midnight Special'' and ''Rock and Roll Palace''.&lt;ref name="Komara2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Komara|title=Encyclopedia of the Blues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-w-uGwm_LhcC&amp;pg=PA1096|year=2006|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-92699-7|pages=1096–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of actors and media personalities began their careers as traditional radio disc jockeys who played and introduced records, such as [[Hogan's Heroes]] star [[Bob Crane]], talk show host [[Art Bell]], ''[[American Idol]]'' host [[Ryan Seacrest]], and [[Howard Stern]].&lt;ref name="Paxson2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peyton Paxson|title=Media Literacy: Thinking Critically about Music &amp; Media|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ETz6OW44JQcC&amp;pg=PA28|date=January 2003|publisher=Walch Publishing|isbn=978-0-8251-4487-5|pages=28–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dick Clark]] was a radio DJ at [[WFIL]] in [[Philadelphia]] before he began hosting [[WFIL-TV]]'s [[American Bandstand]].&lt;ref name="Sagolla2011"&gt;Lisa Jo Sagolla.

Radio DJs often acted as commercial brokers for their program and actively solicited paying sponsors. They could also negotiate which sponsors would appear on their program. Many wrote and delivered the commercials themselves, talking the place of advertising agencies who formerly executed these responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Russo2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Russo|title=Points on the Dial: Golden Age Radio beyond the Networks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zBlyzQdnEssC&amp;pg=PA165|date=20 January 2010|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-9112-0|pages=165–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Drive time]] or "morning drive" shows capitalized on a listening audience of weekday commuters and parents getting children ready for school. Morning DJs such as New York's [[Don Imus]] and DJ teams such as [[Mark and Brian]] in Los Angeles are examples of notable radio personalities whose morning drive format included playing songs as well as sharing stories and taking listener phone calls.&lt;ref name="DelaneyMadigan2016"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc2MDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92 Lessons Learned from Popular Culture]''. SUNY Press; 28 June 2016. {{ISBN|978-1-4384-6147-2}}. p. 92–.&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio disc jockey programs were often syndicated, at first with hourly musical programs with entertainers such as [[Dick Powell]] and [[Peggy Lee]] acting as radio DJs introducing music and providing continuity and commentary,&lt;ref name="Blanchard2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret A.

== Record hops ==
In the 1950s, radio disc jockeys from local and regional radio stations took advantage of their popularity and augmented their income by playing records and performing as [[master of ceremonies]] at teen dance parties called [[sock hop]]s or [[Sock hop|record hops]]. The term came about because these events were commonly held at [[high school]]s, often in the school [[gym]] or [[cafeteria]], and dancers were asked to remove their hard-soled shoes to protect the varnished floor of the gymnasium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mAdUqLrKw4YC|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|page=1811|first=Eric|last=Partridge|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|isbn=9780415259385}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wcrg"&gt;{{cite web|title=Throughout the 1950s and 60s WPOP disc jockeys were all over Central Connecticut emceeing various record hops|url=http://www.wdrcobg.com/wpop_hopjocks.html|website=WCRG/WPOP|publisher=Man From Mars Productions|accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Record hops became strongly associated with early [[rock and roll]]. "[[At the Hop]]", a 1957 hit song by [[Danny and the Juniors]], described the scene: "where the jockey is the smoothest, and the music is the coolest at the hop".&lt;ref name="NiefMcBride2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ron Nief|author2=Tom McBride|title=The Mindset List of the Obscure: 74 Famously Forgotten Icons from A to Z|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVU8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT199|date=2 September 2014|publisher=Sourcebooks|isbn=978-1-4022-9347-4|pages=199–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the DJ introducing and playing popular records, local bands and solo recording artists sometimes performed live at these events. Record hops were often sponsored by radio stations as a way to promote their disc jockeys, or by [[Record shop|record stores]] to promote the sale of records. They were also sponsored by school or church organizations who considered them "wholesome recreation" for teenagers.&lt;ref name="Cole2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clay Cole|title=Sh-Boom!: The Explosion of Rock 'n' Roll (1953-1968)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kWoLGiW-wnAC&amp;pg=PA16|date=1 October 2009|publisher=Morgan James Publishing|isbn=978-1-60037-768-6|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission was either free, or a small admission fee was charged.&lt;ref name="Renzoni2017"&gt;{{cite book|author=Tony Renzoni|title=Connecticut Rock ‘n’ Roll: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G_QvDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA22|date=7 August 2017|publisher=Arcadia Publishing Incorporated|isbn=978-1-4396-6207-6|pages=22–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Graebner2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Graebner|title=Coming Of Age In Buffalo: Youth and Authority in the Postwar Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q844jkouAYUC&amp;pg=PA39|date=25 September 2010|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-4399-0475-6|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, [[Cleveland]] radio DJ [[Bill Randle]] personalized his own style of record hops called "Randle Romps" which he used to gauge the reactions of teenagers to new records he wished to promote while on the air.

== Pirate radio DJs ==
[[File:ERosko.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Radio Caroline DJ Emperor Rosko]]
During the 1960s, [[pirate radio]] stations proliferated off the coast of [[England]] in response to popular demand for new music not provided by traditional radio outlets such as the [[BBC]]. Up to 21 pirate stations were active at one time, including [[Radio Caroline]], [[Wonderful Radio London]] and [[Radio Atlanta]]. DJs such as [[John Peel]], [[Tony Blackburn]], [[Kenny Everett]], [[Tony Prince]], [[Emperor Rosko]] and [[Spangles Muldoon]] pioneered an innovative, American-influenced style of presentation, often programming their personal music choices rather than adhere to a strict playlist, thereby winning large audiences hungry for youth-oriented sounds and the latest musical trends. When the [[Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967|Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act]] virtually ended pirate radio in 1967, many offshore pirate radio DJs moved to the relatively progressive land-based [[BBC radio 1]] which was established that same year as a response to the public's changing musical tastes.&lt;ref name="Chignell2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hugh Chignell|title=Key Concepts in Radio Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZU0oAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT146|date=5 March 2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4739-0360-9|pages=146–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Willis Conover 1969.jpg|thumb|upright|Willis Conover on the Voice of America in 1969]]
During [[World War II]], disc jockey programs such as ''[[GI Jive]]'' were broadcast by the U.S. [[American Forces Network|Armed Forces Radio Service]] to troops. ''GI Jive'' initially featured one of a series of guest DJs for each broadcast who would introduce and play popular recordings of the day; some were civilian celebrities, while others were servicemen. In May 1943, however, the format settled on a single regular host DJ, Martha Wilkerson, who was known on the air as "GI Jill."&lt;ref&gt;''The Directory of the Armed Forces Radio Service Series''.

University of Oregon.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Axis powers]] radio broadcasts aimed at Allied troops also adopted the disc jockey format, featuring personalities such as [[Tokyo Rose]] and [[Axis Sally]] who played popular American recorded songs interspersed with propaganda.

During the [[Vietnam War]], [[United States Air Force]] [[sergeant]] [[Adrian Cronauer]] was a notable Armed Forces Radio disc jockey whose experiences later inspired the 1987 film ''[[Good Morning, Vietnam]]'' starring [[Robin Williams]] as Cronauer.&lt;ref name="urgentcomm"&gt;{{citation|url=http://urgentcomm.com/mag/radio_real_life_adrian/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509103859/http://urgentcomm.com/mag/radio_real_life_adrian/ |date=March 1, 2005 |accessdate=2013-01-13 |archivedate=May 9, 2012 |author=Jim Barthold |publisher=Urgent Communications |title=The real life of Adrian Cronauer |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/adrian-cronauer-air-force-radio-announcer-in-vietnam.htm Adrian Cronauer: Air Force Radio Announcer in Vietnam] at HistoryNet.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cold War]] radio DJ [[Willis Conover]]'s program on the [[Voice of America]] from 1955 through the mid-1990s featured [[jazz]] and other "prohibited" American music aimed at listeners in the [[Soviet Union]] and other Communist countries. Conover reportedly had "millions of devoted followers in Eastern Europe alone; his worldwide audience in his heyday has been estimated at up to 30 million people".&lt;ref name="Freund"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freund|first1=Charles Paul|title=The DJ Who Shook the Soviet Union With Jazz|url=http://www.newsweek.com/dj-who-shook-soviet-union-jazz-360935|website=Newsweek|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== African American disc jockeys ==

[[African American]] radio DJs emerged in the mid 1930s and late 1940s, mostly in cities with large black populations such as New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Detroit.

[[Jack L. Cooper]] was on the air 91⁄2 hours each week on Chicago's WCAP and is credited with being one of the first black radio announcers to broadcast gramophone records, including gospel music and jazz, using his own phonograph.&lt;ref name=aaregistry&gt;[http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/chicagos-radio-voice-jack-cooper "Chicago's Radio Voice, Jack Cooper", at ''African American Registry''].

DJ [[Herb Kent (disc jockey)|Herb Kent]] began his career in 1944 playing classical records on Chicago's [[WBEZ]], then an FM broadcasting service for the [[Chicago Public Schools]]. During the 1950s, Kent worked at [[WGRB|WGES]] in Chicago and then at [[WBGX|WBEE]] where he coined the phrase "dusty records" or "dusties." He spent several years as one of the original DJs at [[WVON]], a "heritage" station to Chicago's black community.&lt;ref name="KentSmallwood2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Herb Kent|author2=David Smallwood|title=The Cool Gent: The Nine Lives of Radio Legend Herb Kent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f92pJ3JhaJYC&amp;pg=PA80|year=2009|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-56976-254-7|pages=80–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hal B. Jackson.jpg|thumb|upright|Hal Jackson]]
In 1939, [[Hal Jackson]] was the first African American radio sportscaster at [[WLXE|WOOK]]-AM in [[Washington, DC]], and later hosted ''The House That Jack Built'', a DJ program of [[jazz]] and [[blues]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiohof.org/hal_jackson.htm Hal Jackson] National Radio Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson moved to New York City in 1954, and was the first radio personality to broadcast three daily shows on three different New York stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhregister.com/news/article/New-York-black-radio-pioneer-Hal-Jackson-dies-11453182.php New York black radio-pioneer Hal Jackson dies] New Haven Register&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1990, Jackson was the first minority inducted into the [[NAB Broadcasting Hall of Fame|National Association of Broadcaster's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Mel (May 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/nyregion/hal-jackson-pioneer-in-radio-and-racial-progress-dies-at-96.html?_r=0 Hal Jackson, 96, New York Broadcaster Who Broke Racial Barriers in Radio, Dies] New York Times&lt;/ref&gt;

Other prominent black DJs included [[Al Benson]] on WGES, who was the first popular disc jockey to play urban blues and use "black street slang" in his broadcasts. Jesse "Spider" Burke hosted a popular show on KXLW in Saint Louis, Missouri. James Early was featured on [[WROX (AM)]] in Clarkesdale, Mississippi. Ramon Bruce became a prominent DJ at [[WHAT (AM)]] in Philadelphia. Some of these radio pioneers of the [[Black-appeal stations|Black-appeal radio]] period presaged the [[Top 40]], playing recordings that were targeted to the black youth and reflected jukebox selections that were popular.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, William (1999) Voice Over: The Making of Black Radio- Philadelphia:Temple Univ press {{ISBN|1-56639-666-2}}, pg100&lt;/ref&gt; Most major U.S. cities operated a full-time rhythm and blues radio station, and as African Americans traveled the country they would spread the word of their favorite radio personalities.&lt;ref name="Sterling2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher H.

[[Nathanial Dowd Gaston Williams|Nat D. Williams]] was the first African American disc jockey on [[WDIA]] in Memphis with his popular ''Tan Town Jamboree'' show. African American radio DJs found it necessary to organize in order to gain opportunities in the radio industry, and in the 1950s [[Joseph Deighton Gibson Jr.|Jack Gibson]] of [[WERD]] formed the National Jazz, Rhythm and Blues Disc Jockey Association. The group's name was later changed to the National Association of Radio and Television Announcers. In 1960, radio station managers formed the Negro Radio Association to foster and develop programming and talent in the radio broadcasting industry.&lt;ref name="Barlow1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Barlow|title=Voice Over: The Making of Black Radio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJuIHrKBONMC&amp;pg=PA97|year=1999|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-56639-667-7|pages=97–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterling2004" /&gt;

==Women disc jockeys==

With exceptions such as Halloween Martin's work in 1929 at WBBM in Chicago,&lt;ref name="Keith2008" /&gt; the radio DJ profession in the U.S. was historically male-dominated. However beginning in the Top 40 era, female disc jockeys became more common. Judy Dibble on [[WDGY]] in Minneapolis started as "sidekick" to a male DJ in the mid 1960s and later went on to host her own DJ show.&lt;ref name="Halper2015" /&gt;

[[Alison Steele]] began her career at [[WNEW-FM]] in the late 1960s. Responding to an ad for female disk jockeys, Steele auditioned with 800 other women and was chosen with three others to launch an "all woman" format. When WNEW abandoned this format in 1967 after an 18‐month trial, Steele was the only one asked to stay on.&lt;ref name="NYT1971"&gt;{{cite web|title=In the World of Radio, She's a Rare Bird|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/09/archives/in-the-world-of-radio-shes-a-rare-bird.html?_r=0|website=New York Times|publisher=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a late night show host, Steele created an on-air persona, calling herself "The Nightbird". Her popularity grew, drawing an average nightly audience of 78,000. In 1976, Steele was the first woman chosen by [[Billboard magazine]] as "FM Personality of the Year", and she was instrumental in promoting performers such as the [[Moody Blues]]. She worked as an announcer for [[Search for Tomorrow]] and also as a producer at [[CNN]], returning to WNEW in 1984. In later years, she was known as "The Grand Dame of New York Night".&lt;ref name="SterlingSteele"&gt;Christopher H. Sterling.

Maxanne Sartori was the first female progressive rock DJ on [[KSWD (FM)|KOL-FM]] in Seattle and was subsequently hired in 1970 as an afternoon DJ for [[WBCN-FM]] in Boston.

Radio disc jockey [[Donna Halper]] is credited with discovering the rock band [[Rush (band)|Rush]] while working as a radio DJ at [[WMMS]] in Cleveland in 1974. After Halper played a track called “Working Man” on the air, listeners began requesting more Rush songs, prompting other radio stations to add Rush songs to their playlists. Acknowledging her role in their success, the band dedicated its first two albums to her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Vit | last = Wagner | title = What A Rush! | newspaper= [[Toronto Star]] | date = 2002-05-11 | page = J8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = McLean | first = Chuck | title = Quincy Woman Still Promoting Rush 34 Years After Discovering Band | newspaper= [[The Patriot Ledger]] | date = 2008-07-09 | url = http://www.patriotledger.com/entertainment/x2043505192/Quincy-woman-still-promoting-Rush-34-years-after-discovering-band}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halper appeared in the documentary, ''[[Rush: Beyond the Lighted Stage]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.wickedlocal.com/whattodo/2010/06/10/women-see-underlying-theme-in-rush-documentary-film/ "Women see 'underlying theme' in Rush documentary film"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619233846/http://blogs.wickedlocal.com/whattodo/2010/06/10/women-see-underlying-theme-in-rush-documentary-film/ |date=2010-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke at Rush's [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patriotledger.com/features/x41606795/Rush-gets-a-star-in-Hollywood-with-an-assist-from-Quincy-woman "Rush gets a star in Hollywood with an assist from Quincy woman"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Howl"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tsui|first1=Nick|title=Legendary DJ Donna Halper was first to spin Rush in America|url=http://howlmag.com/odyssey-with-rush/|website=Howl Magazine|publisher=Howl Magazine|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DJ Karen Begin (aka Darien O'Toole) is credited with being the first female [[shock jock]].  She promoted herself as the "Morning Beyotch" and "The Antidote to Howard Stern" on her show on San Francisco radio stations [[KSAN-FM|KSAN]] and [[KFRC-FM]] in the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Berton, [http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Darian-O-Toole-S-F-disc-jockey-dies-at-40-3220623.php Darian O'Toole, S.F. disc jockey dies at 40] SFGate.com&lt;/ref&gt;

"Less than a handful" of women were employed as radio DJs in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] before the 1970s. DJ [[Annie Nightingale]] hosted a progressive rock show on BBC Radio 1 in 1969. In 1998, Zoe Ball began hosting the BBC's key breakfast show slot, followed by Sarah Cox in 2000.&lt;ref name="SterlingEncyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christopher H.

== Payola scandal ==
{{main|Payola}}
Especially during the 1950s, the sales success of any record depended to a large extent on its airplay by popular radio disc jockeys.&lt;ref name="britannica.com" /&gt; The [[Commercial bribery|illegal practice of payment]] or other inducement by record companies for the radio broadcast of recordings on [[music radio#Commercial radio|commercial radio]] in which the song is presented by a DJ as being part of the normal day's broadcast became known in the music industry as "payola". The first major [[United States Senate]] payola investigation occurred in 1959. Nationally renowned DJ Alan Freed, who was uncooperative in committee hearings, was fired as a result. DJ [[Dick Clark]] also testified before the committee, but survived, partially due to the fact that he had previously divested himself of ownership interest in all of his music-industry holdings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dick Clark survives the Payola Scandal|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/dick-clark-survives-the-payola-scandal|work=history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the initial investigation, radio DJs were stripped of the authority to make programming decisions, and payola became a misdemeanor offense. Programming decisions became the responsibility of station program directors. As a result, the process of persuading stations to play certain songs was simplified. Instead of reaching numerous DJs, record labels only had to connect with one station program director. Labels turned to independent promoters to circumvent allegations of payola.&lt;ref&gt;Cartwright, Robin (August 31, 2004). "[http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mpayola.html What's the story on the radio payola scandal of the 1950s?]." ''The Straight Dope.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Format changes ==
As radio stations moved from the AM Top 40 format to the FM [[album-oriented rock]] format or adopted more profitable programming such as news and call-in talk shows, the impact of the radio DJ on popular music was lessened. The emergence of [[shock jock]] personalities and [[morning zoo]] formats saw the DJs role change from music host to cultural provocateur and comedian.&lt;ref name="Etling2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurence Etling|title=Radio in the Movies: A History and Filmography, 1926-2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsmP734Ka50C&amp;pg=PA4|date=19 July 2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-8616-8|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 50s to the late 1980s when the Top 40 music radio format was popular, audience measuring tools such as [[Audience measurement#Diaries|ratings diaries]] were used. However a combination of financial pressures and new technology such as [[voice tracking]] and the [[Portable People Meter]] (PPM) began to have negative effects on the role of radio DJs beginning in the late 1990s, prompting one radio program manager to comment, "There was a time when the “top 40” format was ruled by legends such as Casey Kasem, or Wolfman Jack, and others who were known for both playing the hits and talking to you. Now with PPMs, it is all about the music, commercials and the format."&lt;ref name="McKay"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McKay|first1=Jeff|title=The State of the Disc Jockey|url=http://www.radioinfo.com/2013/01/29/the-state-of-the-disc-jockey-part-2/|website=Radio Info|publisher=radioinfo.com|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such format changes as well as the rise of new music distribution models such as [[MP3]] and [[online music store]]s led to the demise of radio DJs reputation as trendsetters and "hit makers" who wielded considerable influence over popular music.&lt;ref name="NYTBooks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Battaglio" /&gt;

The ''' International Academy of Aquatic Art ''' (or '''IAAA''') is a [[nonprofit organization]] for the development of [[Human swimming|swimming]] as a [[Performing arts|performing art]]. It is based in the United States.

==History==
The IAAA was founded in 1955 by former [[Synchronized swimming|synchronized swimmers]] from the USA in order to develop swimming as artistic, creative and non-competitive activity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquatic-art.org/history.htm  History ] on the official website of the IAAA&lt;/ref&gt; The incorporators were:
*'''Mary Derosier:''' former national chairman of the [[Amateur Athletic Union]], which was one of the first organizations who invented synchronized swimming competitions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usasynchro.org/About_Synchro/history.htm History] on the official website of USA Synchronized Swimming. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Richard J. Dodson:''' in 1951 publisher of the first magazine for synchronized swimming, the ''Synchronized Swimmer''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fina.org/content/development Development.] of different forms of artistic swimming on the official website of ''Federation Internationale de natation'' (FINA).&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Henry Gundling:''' synchronized swimming coach, manager and husband of synchronized swimmer [[Beulah Gundling]]

The IAAA regularly organizes festivals throughout the United States and Canada presenting different swimming performances with [[Choreography|choreographies]] for soloists, duets and groups. The IAAA swimmers are called '''''aquatic artists'''''. The style of the performances, which are shown by women and men as well, is a mixture of synchronized swimming, water ballet, ornamental, rhythmic and scientific swimming. In most cases the swimmers use different forms of [[art music]] for the programs presented at the IAAA festivals. [[Bert Hubbard]], one of the first male synchronized swimmers from the USA, is a board member of the IAAA and documents its history and artistic activities.

The '''Keshcarrigan Bowl''' is an [[Iron age]] bronze bowl discovered to the north of [[Keshcarrigan]], [[county Leitrim]], [[Ireland]], in the [[19th century]]. The bowl was found in the waterway between [[Lough Scur]] and [[Lough Marrave]] ("lake of death").{{sfn|Mulvany, Fraser, Roberts, Mulvany, O'Flaherty|1852|pp=lix}} It was perhaps a ceremonial drinking cup.{{sfn|Waddell|1998|pp=325}} The bowl would have been a  prestigious item in [[1st century]] [[Ireland]], the bird-shaped handle outstandingly designed and skillfully executed.{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=94}}{{sfn|Allen|1898|pp=5}} The Keshcarrigan Bowl is in the [[National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology|archaeology branch of the National Museum of Ireland]].{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=92}}

The Keshcarrigan bowl is considered one of the finest classic cast bronze cups, or drinking vessel.  Made of bright-yellow metal, it was discovered {{nobreak|{{circa|1842|1850}}}} during the building of the "[[Shannon–Erne Waterway|Ulster Canal]]".{{sfn|Mulvany, Fraser, Roberts, Mulvany, O'Flaherty|1852|pp=lix}}{{sfn|Waddell|1998|pp=325}}{{sfn|Wilde|1857|534}} The [[bowl]] is a fine golden [[bronze]] only {{convert|14|cm|1}} wide and {{convert|1|mm}} in thickness, being cast or beaten into shape before being finished and polished by being spun on a lathe.{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=92}}{{sfn|Harding|2007|pp=183}}{{sfn|Waddell|1998|pp=323}} The neck was finished off against an internal mould.{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=92}} The principal decorative feature of the bowl is its cast bronze zoomorphic handle, following the graceful shape of a bird-beast head of a somewhat nondescript appearance influenced by the flamboyant ornamentation of its time, soldered to the body of the vessel at the base and loosely connected to the vessel neck.{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=92}}{{sfn|Allen|1898|pp=52}} The ridge at the front of the bird-head, the 'shield' below, and impression of a beak turning-backward, are all characteristic of the male-[[Shelduck]].{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=95}}

In 2018 it was shown on an [[Irish postage stamp]], after featuring in ''[[A History of Ireland in 100 Objects]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://100objects.ie/keshcarrigan-bowl/ Page] in ''[[A History of Ireland in 100 Objects]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style==
[[File:FAKL-8A09C2, Medieval Mount (FindID 575273).jpg|thumb|FAKL-8A09C2, Medieval Mount bearing resemblance to 'Keshcarrigan bowl' mount.]]
{{See also|Torrs Pony-cap and Horns|Witham Shield|Wandsworth Shield}}
The brilliantly modeled ducks-head handle on the Keshcarrigan bowl is an early masterpiece of the style, comparable to the best British work of the period such as the bird-finials on the [[Torrs Pony-cap and Horns|Torrs Chamfrein horns]],{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=94}} the stylistic identity of both heads representing ducks, and both having empty slots for studs in the eyes.{{sfn|Atkinson, Piggott|1953|pp=223}} The Torrs style originated in Britain in the middle or second half of the third century BC. The Keshcarrigan cup is on stylistic grounds likely to be contemporary with the Torrs pieces, with the “crimped” pattern on the rim of the Keshcarrigan bowl perhaps comparable with similar techniques used on [[Wandsworth Shield|the circular Wandsworth boss]] and the terminal circular insignias on the [[Witham Shield]].  The bowl seems to have close affinities to pottery bowls of identical profile from Brittany, which have a similar “crimped” pattern on their inner rims. Being lathe-spun the age of the bowl suggests a comparatively late date at variance with the stylistic evidence.  The bowl is of importance in showing the Torrs style is recorded in both Britain and Ireland.{{sfn|Atkinson, Piggott|1953|pp=231}}  The cup resembles another found at [[Fore, County Westmeath]], which is slightly earlier and imported from Britain, as this may also be.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace and O'Floinn, 4:7 (Fore), 4:8 (Keshcarrigan)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==  
The bowl was intended for drinking purposes, for eating food out of, as a container, and ceremonial purposes.{{sfn|Waddell|1998|pp=325}}{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=94}}{{sfn|Allen|1898|pp=52}} Metal handled cups are a feature of late [[La Tène culture]], and their production might have been stimulated by the re-appearance of wine-services imported from the Classical world.{{sfn|Spratling|1972|pp=221}}{{refn|The bowl was found in, or beside, [[Lough Marrave]]  ({{lang-ga|Loch Marbh}}, "dead lake" or "lake of death"), perhaps deposited as a pagan ritual offering.|group=n|name=cupInDeadLake}}

==Origin==
Some sources suggest the bowl was imported across the [[Irish Sea]] because the practice of producing bronze bowls using a spinning technique was done in the [[Belgae#Belgae outside Gaul|Belgae]] workshops of south-east [[England]], and Roman continental workshops, rather than Ireland.{{sfn|Harding|2007|pp=183}}{{sfn|Jope|1954|pp=93}} However the evidence for this conclusion is conjecture, and the Keshcarrigan bowl was just as likely made in Ireland.{{sfn|Spratling|1972|pp=220}} A reasonably close parallel to the Keshcarrigan cup is a handled vessel of willow, presumably Irish origin, in the National Museum of Ireland, and another bronze handle from a similar profile cup was discovered at [[County Galway]].{{sfn|Spratling|1972|pp=220}} Conversely, though a similar handle was recently found in the Somerset hoard,{{sfn|Harding|2007|pp=183}} no other vessel of this style was found in southern Britain,{{sfn|Spratling|1972|pp=221}} so the practice of making bowls with ornamental bird handles must have become established in Ireland sometime in the early [[1st Century]] AD.{{sfn|Jope|1971|pp=118}}

===Belgae refugees===
[[Fintan O'Toole|O'Toole]] suggested the Keshcarrigan Bowl represents evidence for the movement of people into Ireland following upheavals in Celtic Europe in the century before and after the birth of Christ. Gallic [[Belgae|Belgic tribes]] crossed into Britain as refugees from the Romans and displacing native people some of whom came to Ireland.{{sfn|O'Toole|2013|p=45}}

The [[Latter Day Saint movement]]  teaches that [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] was the mother of [[Jesus]], whose father was [[God the Father]]. Latter Day Saints affirm the [[virgin birth of Jesus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Eleanor |last= Colton |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/4311 |contribution= Virgin Birth |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |location= New York, NY |publisher= Macmillan Publishing Co. |year= 1992 |volume= 4 |page= 1510}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reject the Roman Catholic traditions of the [[Immaculate Conception]], the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]], and her [[Assumption of Mary|assumption]]. They also believe that the [[brothers of Jesus]] were her and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]'s biological children.&lt;ref name = EOM&gt;{{citation |first= Camille |last= Fronk |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/3906 |contribution= Mary, Mother of Jesus |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |location= New York, NY |publisher= Macmillan Publishing Co. |year= 1992 |volume= 2 |pages= 863–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary is not seen as an intercessor between humankind and Jesus, and Latter Day Saints do not pray to Mary.&lt;ref name = EOM/&gt; The [[Book of Mormon]], part of the [[Standard Works|Latter Day Saint canon of scripture]], refers to Mary by name in prophecies of her mission,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|3|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describes her as "most beautiful and fair above all other virgins"&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|1 Nephi|1-ne|11|13|20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a "precious and chosen vessel."&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|7|10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first edition of the Book of Mormon (1830), Mary was referred to as "the mother of God, after the manner of the flesh,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= [[The Book of Mormon]] |location= Palmyra, NY |publisher= E.B. Grandin |year= 1830 |page= 25}}. [http://www.inephi.com/25.htm Online reprint] at ''inephi.com'' by John Hajicek.&lt;/ref&gt; a reading that was changed by [[Joseph Smith]] to "the mother of the Son of God" in subsequent editions (1837–).&lt;ref&gt; {{lds|1 Nephi|1-ne|11|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Latter Day Saint author [[Hugh Nibley]] has argued that the change was made to "avoid confusion, since during the theological controversies of the early Middle Ages the expression 'mother of God' took on a special connotation which it still has for many Christians". ({{citation |url= http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/books/?bookid=74&amp;chapid=909 |chapter= 'There Can Be No More Bible' |title= Since Cumorah |edition= 2nd |location= Salt Lake City, UT |publisher= [[Deseret Book]] and [[FARMS]] |year= 1988 |origyear= 1967 |page= 6 |isbn= 0-87579-139-5 |oclc= 17618853 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of visual artists who are [[Native Americans in the United States]]. The [[Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990]] defines "Native American" as being enrolled in either [[federally recognized tribes]] or [[state recognized tribes]] or "an individual certified as an Indian artisan by an Indian Tribe."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doi.gov/iacb/act.html "The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925020543/http://www.doi.gov/iacb/act.html |date=2006-09-25 }} ''US Department of the Interior, Indian Arts and Crafts Board.'' (retrieved 2 Nov 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; This does not include non-Native American artists using Native American themes.  Additions to the list need to reference a recognized, documented source and specifically name tribal affiliation according to federal and state lists. Indigenous American artists outside the United States can be found at [[List of indigenous artists of the Americas]].
&lt;!--
[[WP:NLIST|Wikipedia notability standards for lists]] requires a citation, preferably more than one, proving the person is a member of the group and notable enough to warrant a stand-alone article. Being related to a notable person in itself confers no degree of notability upon that person. [[WP:ARTIST|Guidelines for notable artists]] include being widely cited by peers (this could include tribal members), originating a new technique, creating significant works, winning critical attention, or being represented in significant permanent collections. For Native American artists, reviving lost art forms is also highly significant.

[[File:Dancer sculpture by Degas at the Met.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A photograph of the sculpture]]
'''''The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer''''' (French: ''La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans'')  is a sculpture begun c. 1880 by [[Edgar Degas]] of a young student of the [[Paris Opera Ballet]] dance school, a Belgian named [[Marie van Goethem]].

==Description==
The sculpture is one-third life size and was originally sculpted in wax, a somewhat unusual choice of medium for the time. It is dressed in a real [[bodice]], [[tutu (clothing)|tutu]] and [[ballet slippers]] and has a wig of real hair. All but a hair ribbon and the tutu are covered in wax. The 28 bronze repetitions that appear in museums and galleries around the world today were cast after Degas' death.  The tutus worn by the bronzes vary from museum to museum.

The exact relationship between [[Marie van Goethem]] and Edgar Degas is a matter of debate. It was common in 1880 for the "Petits Rats" of the Paris Opera to seek protectors from among the wealthy visitors at the back door of the opera.

Realistic wax figures with real hair and real clothes had also been popular in religious, Folk, and fine arts for centuries before Degas created his ''Little Dancer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas Sculptures|last=Joseph Czestochowski and Anne Pingeot|first=|last2=Reff|first2=Theodore|publisher=Torch Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Memphis|pages=52–3|chapter=To Make Sculpture Modern}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas and the Little Dancer|last=Kendall|first=Richard|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms are taut, and the legs and feet are placed in a ballet position akin to fourth position at rest, and there is tension in the pose, an image of a ballerina being put through her paces, not posing in an angelic way. Her face is – "contorted, people thought it was a deliberate image of ugliness, but you could also say it's the image of a sickly gawky adolesecent who is being made to do something she doesn't totally want to do."&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Marlow]] on... Degas, Sickert &amp; Toulouse-Lautrec' Channel 5 TV&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Edgar Degas La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans cast in 1997.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Angle from "The Complete Sculptures of Edgar Degas" collection at [[M.T. Abraham Foundation]], cast in 1997. Note the varying tutu.]]When the ''La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans'' was shown in Paris at the Sixth Impressionist Exhibition of 1881, it received mixed reviews. [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] called it "the first truly modern attempt at sculpture I know." Certain critics were shocked by the piece, and the dancer was compared to a monkey and an [[Aztec]]. One critic, Paul Mantz, called her the "flower of precocious depravity," with a face "marked by the hateful promise of every vice" and "bearing the signs of a profoundly heinous character."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2011-11-02 | url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-10-11/features/1998284216_1_classical-sculpture-original-sculpture-dancer | title=Degas's Little Dancer is still on the point of controversy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparisons with older art were made, perhaps partly because it was exhibited in a glass case, like classical sculpture in the [[Louvre]], and was dressed in wig and clothes.

After Degas' death, his heirs (brother and sister's children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2011-11-02 | url=http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/highlights/highlight110292.html | title=National Gallery of Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;) made the decision to have the bronze repetitions of ''Le Petite Danseuse'' and other wax and mixed-media sculptures cast. The casting took place at the Hébrard foundry in Paris from 1920 until 1936 when the Hébrard foundry went bankrupt and closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas Sculptures|last=Joseph Czestochowski and Anne Pingeot|first=|last2=Pingeot|first2=Anne|publisher=Torch Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=Memphis|pages=34|chapter=Degas and His Castings}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, "Hébrard" Degas ''Little Dancer'' bronzes were cast at the Valsuani foundry in Paris until the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas’ Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen: The earlier version that helped spark the birth of modern art|last=Hedberg|first=Gregory|publisher=Arnoldsche Fine Art Publishers|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=10, 19, 28 n. 6–7, 30 n. 44, 74, 99 n. 221, 272–281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixty-nine of Degas' wax sculptures survived the casting process. One copy of ''Le Petite Danseuse'' is currently owned by the creator and owner of [[Auto Trader Group|Auto Trader]], [[John Madejski]]. He stated that he bought the sculpture by accident.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} That copy was sold for £13,257,250 ($19,077,250) at [[Sotheby's]] on February, 3rd 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2009-02-04 | url=http://www.artvalue.com/sale--9928--Sotheby-s-London-New-Bond-Street-L09601-Impressionist-Modern.htm | title=Auction results}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another Hébrard ''Little Dancer'' bronze failed to sell at a November 2011 auction at [[Christie's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=2011-11-02 | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/11/02/bloomberg_articlesLU0CEK07SXKX.DTL | title=Degas Ballerina Fails to Sell at Christie's as Markets Plummet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To construct the statue, Degas used pigmented beeswax, with a metal armature, rope, and paintbrushes covered by clay for structural support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edgar Degas Sculpture: The Collections of the National Gallery of Art, Systematic Catalogue|last=Suzanne G. Lindsay, Daphne S. Barbour, and Shelley G. Sturman|first=|publisher=National Gallery of Art|year=2010|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=116–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Little Dancer'' wax sculpture we see today is a reworked version of the original sculpture that was shown in 1881. After seeing the wax sculpture in Degas’ living quarters in April 1903, the New York collector Louisine Havemeyer expressed interest in buying the wax. After proposing a bronze or cast wax of the sculpture, which Mrs. Havemeyer refused, Degas took his wax figure upstairs to his working studio and told Vollard he was reworking the sculpture for Havemeyer for 40,000 francs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Private Collection of Edgar Degas|last=Ann Dumas, Colta Ives, Susan Alyson Stein, and Gary Tinterow|first=|last2=Tinterow|first2=Gary|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1997|isbn=|location=New York|pages=101|chapter=Appendix: Mary Cassatt on the Degas Sales and the Casting of Sculpture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Degas never sold the sculpture to Mrs. Havemeyer. After Degas died, it was found in a corner of his studio. Paul Lefond, Degas’ biographer, described the ''Little Dancer'' wax after Degas’ death as "nothing but a ruin;"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas, vol. II|last=Lafond|first=Paul|publisher=H. Floury|year=1918–19|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mary Cassatt telegraphed Mrs. Havemeyer "Statue Bad Condition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas|last=Jean Sutherland Boggs, Douglas W. Druick, Henri Loyrette, Michael Pantazzi, and Gary Tinterow|first=|last2=Pantazzi|first2=Michael|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|pages=352, n. 12|chapter=The Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the wax sculpture we know today is not a ruin. It is Degas' reworked second version of his wax figure. At some point before Degas extensively reworked his sculpture, he allowed a plaster to be cast from the wax figure. This recently re-discovered plaster records the ''Little Dancer''’s original pose, bodice, and hairdo. The plaster is now in a private collection in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Degas’ Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen: The earlier version that helped spark the birth of modern art|last=Hedberg|first=Gregory|publisher=Arnoldsche|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=10–64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original wax sculpture was acquired by [[Paul Mellon]] in 1956. Beginning in 1985, Mr and Mrs Mellon gave the [[National Gallery of Art]] 49 Degas waxes, 10 bronzes and 2 plasters, the largest group of original Degas sculptures. ''Little Dancer'' was among the bequests. In 1997, the Airaindor-Valsuani foundry in France began casting a limited edition of Degas bronzes from the pre-1903 ''Little Dancer'' plaster. One such ''Little Dancer'' bronze is owned by the [[M.T. Abraham Foundation]], which, at times, is lent to other institutions and museums including the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Edgar Degas: Figures in Motion|last=Mikhail B. Piotrovsky, Amir Gross Kabiri, Geraldine Norman, Jon Whiteley, June Hargrove, and Dalit Lahav-Durst|first=|publisher=Petronius Publishing House, Ltd.|year=2013|isbn=|location=St. Petersburg|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the various states of many of Degas' prints, the Valsuani bronzes record the first version of Degas' ''Little Dancer'', while the Hébrard casts record the second and final state of the sculpture.

On September 12, 2016, Dr. Gregory Hedberg presented a paper entitled "Unraveling the Mysteries of Degas’ ''Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen''," at the French Institute, Alliance Français, in New York City.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pr3OYfY0zc&amp;feature=youtu.be|title="Unraveling the Mysteries of Degas’ Little Dancer, Aged Fourteen"|last=Hedberg|first=Gregory|date=|website=YouTube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5977">The '''Lough Lene Boat''', also known as '''The Monks' Boat''', is an [[Underwater archaeology|underwater archaeological]] artifact from [[prehistoric Ireland]]. It was discovered in 1968 on the east side of  [[Lough Lene]], [[County Westmeath]] nearest to the Cummerstown/Windtown townlands of [[Collinstown]].  [[Radiocarbon dating]] revealed that the boat was constructed sometime between the [[Early history of Ireland|1st and 4th century]].&lt;ref name="askaboutireland.boat"&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/environment-geography/physical-landscape/lakelands-of-westmeath/lough-lene/the-monks-boat/ The Monk's boat], Ask About Ireland. Retrieved 15 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==
[[File:NunsTurgesius Castle isles Lough Lene.JPG|thumb|right|[[Nuns Island]], a site popularly associated with the history of the Lough Lene Boat, is visible in this photo of [[Lough Lene]] shows.  Turgesius Island and the Castle Isles are also visible.  The mainland is in the foreground.]]
The boat, which resembled a "dug out [[canoe]]", was discovered by [[Underwater diving|divers]] belonging to the local [[Mullingar]] Sub Aqua Club.  The divers moved the boat into shallower water and then, on 28 September 1958, brought it ashore for examination by [[Archaeology|experts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/image_large?asset_id=7657 Photo of the Mullingar Sub Aqua Club]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
P. O hEailidhe from the [[National Museum of Ireland]] reported: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"the Lough Lene boat combines techniques of [[sewn boat]] construction together with that of [[Mortise and tenon|mortise-and-tenon]] in a way which cannot be paralleled elsewhere at present."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=4070 P. O hEailidhe, National Museum of Ireland] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220237/http://www.askaboutireland.ie/show_narrative_page.do?page_id=4070 |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legend==
"The Monks' Boat" appellation comes from a [[History of the Republic of Ireland|20th century]] [[folklore|local tradition]] that associates the boat with the [[monk]]s of the [[Ruins|ruined]] [[Fore Abbey]].  Although the boat pre-dates the [[abbey]] by several centuries, it is thought that the boat may have been sunk while moving religious artifacts used during [[Mass (liturgy)|mass]] in the Fore Abbey and on the [[convent]] on [[Nuns Island, Lough Lene|Nuns Island]].  Another [[legend]] holds that locals, believing the boat [[curse]]d with bad fortune, did not wish the boat recovered.&lt;ref name="askaboutireland.boat"/&gt;

Because of theories about a possible [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] origin for the Lough Lene Boat, some have even speculated a connection between the vessel and [[St. Patrick]].  According to the [[Annals of Ulster]] (a [[Early Modern Ireland 1536–1691|late medieval]] document in which dates, especially of earlier events, are suspect) the [[Early Medieval Ireland 800–1166|era of St. Patrick's life]] coincides with scientific estimation of when the boat was constructed.

==The Lough Lene Bell==
[[Image:Lough Lene Bell Riplica.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Lough Lene Bell]]
In 1882, the Royal Irish Academy was presented with the Bell of [[Lough Lene]] by the Barbavila estate proprietor, Mr. William Barlow Smythe.  The bell had been discovered the previous year in Lough Lene by a boy fishing for eels on Castle Island, which was owned by Smythe at the time.

Given the close proximity to the [[Fore Abbey]], the estate owner Smythe concluded that the bell possibly belonged to the St Feichin Abbey; During the Viking and Anglo-Norman oppressions, it may have been transferred to Nun's Island, before being eventually being hidden upon Castle Island.

The [[Bell (instrument)|Bell]] has a faint outline of the Christian [[Celtic cross]] upon opposing sides of the bell and an ornamental periphiral border. Smythe pronounced that ornamentation was generally reserved for the cases or [[shrine]]s for that era and was therefore most unusual.
The bell appears similar to two other bells from that early Christian period. These had been found in [[Bangor, County Down]] in the year 1832, and  another in [[Cashel, County Tipperary]] in 1849. Smythe, the Barbavila owner, believed that the Lough Lene Bell was contemporary to these bells which were believed to be from the 7th century, therefore supporting his theory that it was possible that it could have been a relic of [[St. Feichin]]s.
The Folklore Commission also hold an account of Kit "the Blade" Fagan's discovery of the bell, which  consequentially triggered a local treasure hunt for further artifacts around [[Collinstown]] and Fore.

While the original ''Lough Lene Bell'' remains within the National Museum, a half sized replica holds a place of pride as the [[Ceann Comhairle]]'s Bell in Dáil Éireann.
This replica was presented to the Dáil in 1931 by the widow of Major [[Bryan Cooper (politician)|Bryan Cooper]], a former member of the House.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/environment-geography/physical-landscape/lakelands-of-westmeath/lough-lene/the-bell-of-lough-lene/index.xml The bell of Lough Lene], Ask About Ireland.

[[File:Correggio_MadonnaSzentFerenccel.jpg|thumb|''Madonna and Child with St Francis'']]
'''''Madonna and Child with St Francis''''' or '''''Madonna of St Francis''''' is a 1514-1515 painting by [[Correggio]], now held in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] in [[Dresden]], Germany. It shows [[Francis of Assisi]], with the stigmata, prostrating himself before an enthroned Madonna and Child - the work's theme is the intercession of the Madonna, which was promoted by the [[Franciscans]] after the definition of the dogma of the [[Immaculate Conception]] in 1473. Francis is supported by [[Anthony of Padua]], whilst on the right are [[Catherine of Alexandria]] and [[John the Baptist]] and on the base of the Madonna's throne is a small [[grisaille]] image of [[Moses]] with the tablets of the law. Catherine's wheel bears the painter's signature "Antonivs de Alegri F.[ecit]".

==History==
The contract for the work (Correggio's first major commission) was signed by the artist on 30 August 1514, with the consent of his still-unmarried father, and of brother Girolamo Cattania, the guardian of the Franciscan convent in the town of [[Correggio, Emilia-Romagna]], whose church was dedicated to St Francis. The work was probably meant as the high altarpiece for the convent church - that altar was site of the Da Correggio family vault. He was paid for it on 4 April 1515, showing how fast he produced it - these two records provide the first documentary evidence of his career. 

Just before 1638 the painting was confiscated by [[Francesco I d'Este]] and taken to the [[Ducal Palace of Modena|Palazzo Ducale]] in [[Modena]], where it hung alongside five other Correggios seized from the duchy's territory. In 1746 the impoverished [[Francesco III d'Este]] tried to raise some money by selling the hundred most famous works in the [[Galleria Estense]], including the six Correggios, to [[Augustus III of Saxony]].

[[File:Marie Antoinette The Journey.jpg|thumb|right|Orion Publishing Group]]

'''''Marie Antoinette: The Journey''''' is a sympathetic 2001 biography of [[archduchess]] [[Marie Antoinette]], the [[Queen of France]] (1774–1792) by [[Antonia Fraser]].  It is the basis for the 2006 [[Sofia Coppola]] film ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]''.

The book, which was relaunched to coincide with the release of the related film, has had considerable success.  It has been translated into French and Italian, been awarded the Enid McLeod Literary Prize, received critical praise including being described "definitive" by British historian, [[Amanda Foreman (biographer)|Amanda Foreman]], author of a bestselling biography of [[Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire|Georgiana, duchess of Devonshire]]. It is considered, by some modern historians, as the most thorough and balanced biography of the queen,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} though it naturally builds upon earlier biographies, first hand accounts, and even the infamous [[libelle (literary genre)|libelles]] which destroyed the queen's reputation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2255">The '''Moscow Conceptualist''', or '''Russian Conceptualist''', movement began with the [[Sots art]] of [[Komar and Melamid]] in the early 1970s, and continued as a trend in [[Russian art]] into the 1980s.  It attempted to subvert socialist ideology using the strategies of [[conceptual art]] and [[appropriation art]].

The central figures were [[Dmitri Prigov]], [[Ilya Kabakov]], [[Irina Nakhova]], [[Viktor Pivovarov]], [[Eric Bulatov]], [[Andrei Monastyrski]] and [[Komar and Melamid]].

[[Mikhail Epstein]], in ''After the Future: The Paradoxes of Postmodernism and Contemporary Russian Culture'' (1995) explains why conceptualism is particularly appropriate to the culture and history of Russia, but also how it differs from Western Conceptualism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In the West, conceptualism substitutes "one thing for another"--a real object for its verbal description. But in Russia the object that should be replaced is simply absent.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Epstein (1995) quotes [[Ilya Kabakov]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“This contiguity, closeness, touchingness, contact with nothing, emptiness makes up, we feel, the basic peculiarity of 'Russian conceptualism'... It is like something that hangs in the air, a self-reliant thing, like a fantastic construction, connected to nothing, with its roots in nothing... So, then, we can say that our own local thinking, from the very beginning in fact, could have been called 'conceptualism'.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''My Joy''''' ({{lang-ru|Счастье моё}}) is a 2010 internationally co-produced Russian-language  [[road movie|road]] film directed by [[Sergei Loznitsa]]. It is set in the western regions of Russia, somewhere near [[Smolensk]]. ''My Joy'' was the first Ukrainian film ever to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]].

==Plot==
It is summer, and young driver Georgy takes his light truck on a trip to another town with a cargo of flour. He is stopped at a road police post by a pair of rude and corrupt policemen. While they are flirting with the woman they stopped earlier, Georgy manages to grab his papers and leave unnoticed. There he picks up a hitchhiker, an old man who recounts him a disturbing story: soon after [[World War II]], while returning home from the front, a corrupt military officer brazenly robbed him by threatening him with arrest if he did not comply. He later shot the officer in retaliation. Later when Georgy parks his truck and steps out and shortly returns, the old man has disappeared.

Later Georgy meets an underage prostitute. He takes pity on the girl and gives her some money and food, but she is offended by his charity, insults him and leaves.

Later still, Georgy is lost in the night and decides to camp in the field until dawn. Three locals approach and try to steal from the truck, only to be stopped by Georgy. They distract his attention with some neutral conversation, telling him how one of their friends is a [[Elective mutism|mute]] because someone killed his father in front of him when he was a child. Suddenly one hits Georgy on the head with a log and he loses consciousness.

The scene shifts to the times of World War II. Early in the war, two Soviet soldiers from a defeated unit cautiously feel their way through the occupied land in the deep German rear. They enter a lone house where a widowed teacher lives with his infant son. The teacher is kind to the soldiers and provides them with much-needed food and shelter. However, the soldiers regard his pacifism and indifference towards the German invaders as treasonous, so they kill him, rob the house, and continue on their way, leaving the child to his own devices.

The scene shifts back to the present. Some time has passed. It is winter, and Georgy lives in the same house that once was the teacher's. The blow has left him feeble-minded and mute. He walks around bearded, dilapidated, with a blank stare. The woman living in the house keeps him as a sex slave while she trades his flour on the local market. A policeman approaches and tells her that Georgy and his truck are being searched for, so she had better get rid of both. Georgy is beaten by the locals and detained by the police, only to be released the next night when another inmate challenges the lone guard to a fight, beats him unconscious, and unlocks the cells.

The woman sells Georgy's truck and leaves the place, abandoning him in the snowcapped village. Homeless, he wanders about being driven off by the locals, until he collapses from exhaustion. He is found and picked up by the old man whom he earlier gave a ride.

A military van comes to the village, carrying two servicemen tasked with delivering the body of a deceased soldier to his native place. Their daunting task is not made easier by the fact that one of them, an officer, suffers from [[delirium tremens]]. Unable to locate the relatives of the dead soldier, they decide to bribe some random people into signing the papers and leave the body to them. They approach the old man, who at first is suspicious but eventually agrees. However, shortly afterwards Georgy walks out of the house to find the old man dead. It is hinted that he may have been axed by the officer, who in his alcoholic delusion mistook him for someone else.

Georgy numbly grabs the old man's pistol and walks out to the road, where he is picked up by a very talkative truck driver, who rambles about the importance of not meddling in other people's affairs. Meanwhile, on the road the same two police officers from the beginning of the movie stop a police major and his wife. When they begin to write him up for a burnt-out headlight, the major attempts to bribe and intimidate them. When this fails and he turns to leave, a fistfight ensues, with the major handcuffed and brutally beaten. To produce two fake witnesses of his arrest, they stop another car, which is the truck with Georgy. They easily threaten the driver into signing the papers, but when they turn to Georgy, he stands silently. A fight breaks out, and one of the policemen pulls out an assault rifle. Georgy instantly shoots him dead, then everyone else. Still clutching the pistol, he staggers out into the dark.

==Cast==
* Viktor Nemets as Georgy 
* Olga Shuvalova as teenage prostitute 
* [[Vlad Ivanov]] as Major from Moscow 
* Dmitri Gotsdiner as train station Superintendent

==Production==
The film was a co-production between Germany's Ma.ja.de, Ukraine's Sota Cinema Group and the Netherlands' Lemming Film.&lt;ref name=cannes /&gt; The film was shot in Ukraine as a condition for receiving money from the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture, but most of the 1.5 million [[Euro]] budget came from Germany.

== Reviews ==
There was a considerable outcry in Russian media over the film's purported [[Russophobic]] slant.

His dance is called [[Tandava]]m or Nadanta, depending on the context of the dance.&lt;ref name="Verma2011p19"/&gt;&lt;ref name=natarajabrit&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nataraja Nataraja], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; The pose and artwork is described in many Hindu texts such as the ''Anshumadbhed agama'' and ''Uttarakamika agama'', the dance relief or idol featured in all major [[Tamil temple]]s of [[Shaivism]].&lt;ref name=rao223/&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:1 dancing Hindu god Shiva Nataraja Tanjore, India.jpg|250x250px|left|thumb|Nataraja iconography]]
The Tamil word Nadarajar ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: "'''நடராசர்'''" or ''Kooththan'' ''கூத்தன்'') is variously translated as ''Lord of dance'' or ''King of dancers''.&lt;ref name="nat"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coomaraswamy|first1=Ananda K.|title=The dance of Shiva|date=2013|publisher=Rupa|isbn=9788129120908|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stromer|first1=Richard|title=Shiva Nataraja: A Study in Myth, Iconography, and the Meaning of a Sacred Symbol|url=http://www.soulmyths.com/shivanataraja.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ananda Coomaraswamy, the name is related to Shiva's fame as the "Lord of Dancers" or "King of Actors".&lt;ref name=coomarados/&gt;

Nataraja is sometimes also referred to as ''Nateshvara'' (from ''Nata'' which means "act, drama, dance", and ''[[Ishvara]]'' or "lord").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hélène Brunner-Lachaux|author2=Dominic Goodall|author3=André Padoux|title=Mélanges Tantriques À la Mémoire DʼHélène Brunner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7XHXAAAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Institut français de Pondichéry|isbn=978-2-85539-666-8|page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Koothan is derived from the Tamil word ''[[Koothu]]'', which means dance or performance. A male dancer is termed ''Koothan''. Also known as Natarajan in Tamil, meaning "Naatiyathin" (of dance) "Raajan" (king). Naatiyam or Nadanam is another word for dance in Tamil.

==Depiction==
The dance of Shiva in Tillai, the traditional name for [[Chidambaram]], forms the motif for all the depictions of Shiva as Nataraja. He is also known as "Sabesan" which splits as "Sabayil aadum eesan" in Tamil which means "The Lord who dances on the [[dais]]".  This form is present in most Shiva temples, and is the prime deity in the [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Nataraja Temple]] at [[Chidambaram]].&lt;ref name="The Dance of Siva"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/danceofsivafourt01coomuoft Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy, ''The Dance of Siva: Fourteen Indian Essays''  New York, The Sun wise Turn (1918), p. 58.  Internet Archive.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The two most common forms of Shiva's dance are the ''Lasya'' (the gentle form of dance), associated with the creation of the world, and the ''Tandava'' (the vigorous form of dance), associated with the destruction of weary worldviews&amp;nbsp;- weary perspectives and lifestyles. In essence, the [[Lasya]] and the [[Tandava]] are just two aspects of Shiva's nature; for he destroys in order to create, tearing down to build again.&lt;ref name="Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva"&gt;Carmel Berkson, Wendy Doniger, George Michell, ''Elephanta: The Cave of Shiva'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983).  {{ISBN|0691040095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alice Boner, the historic Nataraja artworks found in different parts of India are set in geometric patterns and along symmetric lines, particularly the ''satkona'' mandala ([[hexagram]]) that in the Indian tradition means the interdependence and fusion of masculine and feminine principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alice Boner|title=Principles of Composition in Hindu Sculpture: Cave Temple Period|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doQLZ21CGScC |year=1990|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0705-1|pages=163–164, 257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nataraja is also shown with his wife [[Parvati]] as they dance together.{{cn|date=December 2018}}

==Characteristics==
[[File:Shiva Nataraja(Lord of the Dance).webm|300px|right|(Shiva) Nataraja (Lord of the Dance)]]
As the Lord of Dance, Nataraja, Shiva performs the ''Ananda [[Tandava]]'' (dance of bliss, Tamil: ஆனந்த தாண்டவம்), the dance in which the universe is created, maintained, and dissolved. The symbolism in the art has been variously interpreted by scholars since the Chola empire era:&lt;ref name=rao227/&gt;&lt;ref name=coomarados&gt;[http://www2.hawaii.edu/~freeman/courses/phil300/18.%20The%20Dance%20of%20Shiva.pdf The Dance of Shiva], Ananda Coomaraswamy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancient.eu/article/831/ Shiva Nataraja, lord of the dance] Encyclopedia of Ancient History (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;
* He dances within a circular or cyclically closed arch of flames (''prabha mandala''), which symbolically represent the cosmic fire that in Hindu cosmology creates everything and consumes everything, in cyclic existence or cycle of life. The fire also represents the evils, dangers, heat, warmth, light and joys of daily life. The arch of fire emerges from two ''makara'' on each end, which are water creatures of water and part of Hindu mythologies.
* His legs are bent, which suggests an energetic dance. His long, matted tresses, are shown to be loose and flying out in thin strands during the dance, spread into a fan behind his head, because of the wildness and ecstasy of the dance.
* On his right side, meshed in with one of the flying strands of his hair near his forehead, is typically the river [[Ganges]] personified as a goddess, from the Hindu mythology where the danger of a mighty river is creatively tied to a calm river for the regeneration of life.
* The upper right hand holds a small drum shaped like an hourglass that is called a ''{{IAST|[[ḍamaru]]}}'' in Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alice Boner|author2=Sadāśiva Rath Śarmā|title=Silpa Prakasa Medieval Orissan Sanskrit Text on Temple Architecture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=itQUAAAAIAAJ |year=1966|publisher=Brill Archive|pages=xxxvi, 144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the [[damaru]] drum as one of the attributes of Shiva in his dancing representation see: Jansen, page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; A specific hand gesture ([[mudra]]) called ''{{IAST|ḍamaru-hasta}}'' (Sanskrit for "{{IAST|ḍamaru}}-hand") is used to hold the drum.&lt;ref&gt;Jansen, page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; It symbolizes rhythm and time.
* The upper left hand contains ''Agni'' or fire, which signifies forces of creation and destruction. The opposing concepts show the counterpoise nature of life.
* A cobra uncoils from his lower right forearm, while his palm shows the ''Abhaya'' mudra (meaning ''fearlessness'' in [[Sanskrit]]), suggesting not to fear nearby evil, as well as evil and ignorance surrounding the devotee as he or she follows the righteousness of ''[[dharma]]''.
* The lower left hand is bent downwards at the wrist with the palm facing inward(away from the viewer) and points towards the raised left foot so that it is diametrically opposite to the lower right arm(''Abaya mudra'').
* The face shows two eyes plus a slightly open third on the forehead, which symbolize the triune in Shaivism. The eyes represent the sun, the moon and the third has been interpreted as the inner eye, or symbol of knowledge (''jnana''), urging the viewer to seek the inner wisdom, self-realization. The three eyes alternatively symbolize an equilibrium of the three [[Guṇa]]: Sattva, Rajas and Tamas.
* The dwarf on which Nataraja dances is the demon ''[[Apasmara]] purusha'' ([[Muyalaka]], as it is known in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]), and which symbolises action and dance that leads to victory over demonic evil and ignorance.
* The slightly smiling face of Shiva represents his calmness despite being immersed in the contrasting forces of universe and his energetic dance.&lt;ref name=jharle309&gt;{{cite book|author=James C. Harle|title=The Art and Architecture of the Indian Subcontinent|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwcBVvdqyBkC|year=1994|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-06217-5|pages=309–310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above interpretations of symbolism are largely based on historic Indian texts published in and after 12th-century, such as ''Unmai Vilakkam'', ''Mummani Kovai'', ''Tirukuttu Darshana'' and ''Tiruvatavurar Puranam''.&lt;ref name=coomarados/&gt; Padma Kaimal questions some of these interpretations by referring to a 10th-century text and Nataraja icons, suggesting that the Nataraja statue may have symbolized different things to different people or in different contexts, such as Shiva being the lord of cremation or as an emblem of Chola dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Padma Kaimal (1999), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3051349 Shiva Nataraja: Shifting Meanings of an Icon], The Art Bulletin Volume 81, Issue 3, pages 390-419&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Sharada Srinivasan questions the link to Chola, and has presented archaeological evidence suggesting that Nataraja bronzes and dancing Shiva artwork in South India was a [[Pallava]] innovation, tracing back to 7th to 9th-centuries, and its symbolism should be pushed back by a few centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Srinivasan|first1=Sharada|title=Shiva as 'cosmic dancer': On Pallava origins for the Nataraja bronze| journal=World Archaeology| volume=36|issue=3|year=2004|pages=432–450 |doi=10.1080/1468936042000282726821}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Notwithstanding such claims, it is clear that the Chola style statues are remarkably different and unique when compared to the other sculptures listed below in the gallery.

==Significance==
[[File:Nataraja The Lord of Dance from Thanjavur Palace.jpg|thumb|Nataraja at Thanjavur Palace]]

An essential significance of [[Shiva|Shiva's]] dance at Tillai, the traditional name of [[Chidambaram]], can be explained as:&lt;ref name="The Dance of Śiva"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/danceofsivafourt01coomuoft Ananda Kentish Coomaraswamy, ''The Dance of Śiva: Fourteen Indian Essays''  New York, The Sun wise Turn (1918), p. 58.  Internet Archive.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* First, it is seen as the image of his rhythmic or musical play which is the source of all movement within the universe. This is represented by the circular or elliptical frame surrounding Shiva.
* Secondly, the purpose of his dance is to release the souls of all men from the snare of illusion.
* Lastly, the place of the dance, [[Chidambaram]], which is portrayed as the center of the universe,  is actually within the heart.

Nataraja, states James Lochtefeld, symbolizes "the connection between religion and the arts", and it represents Shiva as the lord of dance, encompassing all "creation, destruction and all things in between".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

Nataraja is a significant visual interpretation of [[Brahman]] and a dance posture of Lord Shiva. The details in the Nataraja artwork has attracted commentaries and secondary literature such as poems detailing its theological significance.&lt;ref name=jharle309/&gt;&lt;ref name=coomarados/&gt; It is one of the widely studied and supreme illustrations of [[Hindu]] art from the medieval era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Smith|title=The Dance of Siva: Religion, Art and Poetry in South India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fTLlcGlkdjkC&amp;pg=PA1|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52865-8|pages=1–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Craven1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roy C.

Stone reliefs depicting the classical form of Nataraja are found in numerous cave temples of India, such as the [[Ellora Caves]] (Maharashtra), the [[Elephanta Caves]], and the [[Badami Caves]] (Karnataka), by around the 6th-century.&lt;ref name=harlep126/&gt;&lt;ref name=verma2012p150/&gt; Archaeological discoveries have yielded a red Nataraja sandstone statue, from 9th to 10th century from [[Ujjain]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], now held at the Gwalior Archaeological Museum.&lt;ref&gt;C Yamamoto (1971), [http://doi.org/10.11168/jeb1947.1971.96_L74 Catalogue of Antiquities from East Asia], Vol. 1971, No. 96, pages L74-L92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James C.

Nataraja gained special significance and became a symbol of royalty in [[Tamil Nadu]]. The dancing Shiva became a part of Chola era processions and religious festivals, a practice that continued thereafter.&lt;ref name="Davis2010p18"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Aghoraśivācārya|author2=Richard H.

The depiction was informed of cosmic or [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] connotations is also argued on the basis of the testimony of the hymns of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] saints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharadasrinivasan.com/data/shivacosmicdancer.pdf Sharada Srinivasan, "Shiva as 'cosmic dancer': on Pallava origins for the Nataraja bronze"],  ''World Archaeology'' (2004) 36(3), pages 432–450.&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest Nataraja statue is in [[Neyveli]], in Tamil Nadu.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In the contemporary Hindu culture of [[Bali]] Indonesia, Siwa (Shiva) Nataraja is the god who created dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Fredrik Eugene DeBoer|author2=I Made Bandem|title=Balinese Dance in Transition: Kaja and Kelod|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-vfAAAAMAAJ |year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-967-65-3071-4|pages=ii–iii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siwa and his dance as Nataraja was also celebrated in the art of Java Indonesia when Hinduism thrived there, while in Cambodia he was referred to as ''Nrittesvara''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alessandra Iyer|title=Prambanan: Sculpture and Dance in Ancient Java : a Study in Dance Iconography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfTVAAAAMAAJ |year=1998|publisher=White Lotus|isbn=978-974-8434-12-4|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, a 2m statue of the dancing Shiva was unveiled at [[CERN]], the European Center for Research in Particle Physics in [[Geneva]]. The statue, symbolizing Shiva's cosmic dance of creation and destruction, was given to CERN by the Indian government to celebrate the research center's long association with India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/29122/3|title=Faces and Places (page 3) - CERN Courier|website=cerncourier.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special plaque next to the Shiva statue explains the significance of the metaphor of Shiva's cosmic dance with quotations from [[Fritjof Capra]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Hundreds of years ago, Indian artists created visual images of dancing Shivas in a beautiful series of bronzes. In our time, physicists have used the most advanced technology to portray the patterns of the cosmic dance. The metaphor of the cosmic dance thus unifies ancient mythology, religious art and modern physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fritjofcapra.net/shivas-cosmic-dance-at-cern/|title=Shiva’s Cosmic Dance at CERN {{!}} Fritjof Capra|website=www.fritjofcapra.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though named "Nataraja bronzes" in Western literature, the Chola Nataraja artworks are mostly in copper, and a few are in brass, typically cast by the ''cire-perdue'' process.&lt;ref name=coomaraswamy18/&gt;

Nataraja is celebrated in 108 poses of [[Bharatanatyam]], with Sanskrit inscriptions from ''[[Natya Shastra]]'', at the [[Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram|Nataraja temple]] in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, India.&lt;ref name="Verma2011p19"&gt;{{cite book|author=Archana Verma|title=Performance and Culture: Narrative, Image and Enactment in India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iAArBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-4438-2832-1|pages=19–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rao223&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

'''Participatory cinema''' tries to involve a film's community in the process of making movies, rather than interaction being left to cinema viewers at the end of the process. The organizers of participatory cinema open up cinema showings and the cinema production process for non professionals.

Where classic [[film production]] focuses on the final [[Product (project management)|product]], participatory cinema focuses on the [[wikt:process|process]] of making movies and its meaning on the participators.

== Examples ==

Participatory documentaries include ''[[RiP!: A Remix Manifesto]]''.

Participatory feature films include projects like ''[[A Swarm of Angels]]'', ''[[Iron Sky]]'' or ''[[The Cosmonaut]]''.

Participatory film platforms and communities include ''[[A Swarm of Angels]]'', [[Open Source Cinema]], [[Sanctuary (short film)|Sanctuary]], ''[[The Cosmonaut]]'' and [[Wreckamovie|Wreck-A-Movie]]

The term '''percent for art''' refers to a program, often a [[city ordinance]], where a fee, usually some percentage of the project cost, is placed on large scale development projects in order to fund and install [[public art]].  The details of such programs vary from area to area. Percent for art programs are used to fund [[public art]] where private or specialized funding of public art is unavailable. Similar programs, such as "[[art in public places]]", attempt to achieve similar goals by requiring that public art be part of a project, yet they often allow developers to pay in-lieu fees to a public art fund as an alternative.

==History==

=== Europe ===
In [[Finland]] the percent for art principle was first introduced as an official government policy in connection with the construction of the Finnish Parliament building in the early 1930s, though it was not implemented until 1939. In 1956 the government extended the principle to all public buildings, and during the 1960s individual municipalities also drew up their own schemes. In 1981 the Association of Finnish Local and Regional Authorities, an advocate for all Finnish municipalities and regions, recommended extending the principle to all aspects of the urban environment. In 1991 the City of Helsinki became the first city to adopt the policy for all building projects, which led to a vast growth in urban art, even within suburban areas. in 2015 the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture funded a handbook available to the sponsors of public art work under the title "The Handbook of the Percent For Art Principle in Finland", which is also published in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prosenttiperiaate.fi/wp-content/uploads/The_Handbook_of_the_Percent_for_Art_Principle_in_Finland_For_Commissioners.pdf|title=The Handbook of the Percent For Art Principle in Finland|access-date=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ireland (country)|Ireland]], one percent of the cost of all public works can be allocated to commissioning a work of art. The scheme was introduced in 1978, and extended to all government departments in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publicart.ie/main/commissioning/funding/per-cent-for-art/|title=Per Cent for Art Scheme|last=|first=|date=|website=publicart.ie|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.publicart.ie/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF_Folder/Public_Art_Per_Cent_for_Art.pdf|title=PUBLIC ART: PER CENT FOR ART SCHEME GENERAL NATIONAL GUIDELINES|last=|first=|date=2004|website=publicart.ie|format=PDF|access-date=19 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
From 1934 to 1943, the [[Section of Painting and Sculpture]] in the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] followed a policy requiring one percent of the cost of federal buildings to be applied toward art and decoration.  In 1959, [[Philadelphia]] adopted the first such municipal ordinance in the United States.&lt;ref name="Abernethy1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lloyd M. Abernethy|title=Benton Spruance, the Artist and the Man|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZ1OhyLKEMIC&amp;pg=PA119|year=1988|publisher=Associated University Presses|isbn=978-0-87982-517-1|pages=118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other jurisdictions followed suit, including  [[Baltimore]] in 1964, [[San Francisco]] and [[Hawaii]] in 1967, and [[Seattle]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Alan J. Stein, [http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=10645 "Seattle's 1 Percent for Art Program"], ''[[HistoryLink]]'', October 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FinkelpearlAcconci2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tom Finkelpearl|author2=Vito Acconci|title=Dialogues in Public Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T51F3wYglToC&amp;pg=PT34|date=January 2001|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-56148-8|pages=20–21 &amp; passim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kemp2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roger L.

More than half of the states now maintain percent-for-art programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasaa-arts.org/Research/Key-Topics/Public-Art/State-Percent-for-Art-Programs.php "State Percent for Art Programs"], National Association of State Arts Agencies (accessed 2015-07-03).&lt;/ref&gt;  On the federal level, since 1963 the [[General Services Administration]] has maintained the Art in Architecture Program, which allocates one-half of one percent of construction cost for art projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104456 "Art in Architecture Program"], [[General Services Administration]] (accessed 2015-07-03).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edwin forrest house01.jpg|thumb|[[Edwin Forrest House]], formerly the home of the Philadelphia School of Design for Women.]]

'''Philadelphia School of Design for Women''' (1848&amp;ndash;1932) was an art school for women in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Under the directorship of [[Emily Sartain]] (1886&amp;ndash;1920), it became the largest art school for women in the United States, and its faculty included [[Robert Henri]], [[Samuel Murray]] and [[Daniel Garber]]. In 1932, it merged into what is now the [[Moore College of Art and Design]]. 

==History==
[[Sarah Peter|Sarah Worthington King Peter]], wife of the British consul in Philadelphia, established an industrial arts school in her home in 1848 to teach women without a means of supporting themselves a trade.

{{Politics of the Republic of Macedonia}}

The existence and distinctiveness of the '''[[Macedonian language]]''' is disputed among linguists and common people from [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and its neighboring countries. The Eastern [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] indigenous to the current Republic of Macedonia are part of [[dialectal continuum]] which stretches from Croatian, Bosnian and [[Serbia]]n [[Shtokavian dialect]] through [[Torlakian dialect|Torlakian]] on the northwest, to western and eastern [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] dialects on the East, and the Macedonian language, like Bulgarian, [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], is a standardized form of (some of) these dialects.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

[[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Bulgarian ethnos]] in Macedonia existed long before the earliest articulations of the idea that [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian Slavs]] might form a separate ethnic group from the [[Bulgarians]] in Danubian Bulgaria and [[Thracian Bulgarians|Thrace]]. Throughout the period of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, the Slav-speaking people of the geographic regions of [[Moesia]], [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] referred to their language as Bulgarian and called themselves Bulgarians.&lt;ref&gt;Verković, St. ''Narodne pesme makedonski bugara (Folk Songs of the Macedonian Bulgarians)''. Beograd, 1860.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miladinov, D. and Miladinov, K. ''Bulgarian Folk Songs (Български народни песни)''. Zagreb, 1861.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Serbian researcher St. Verković who was a long term teacher in Macedonia, sent by the Serbian government with special assimilatory mission wrote in the preface of his collection of Bulgarian folk songs: "I named these songs Bulgarian, and not Slavic because today when you ask any Macedonian Slav: Who are you? he immediately answers: I am Bulgarian and call my language Bulgarian...."&lt;ref&gt;"Но ја сам ове песме назвао бугарскима, а не словенскима, због тога, јер данас кад би когод македонског Славенина запитао: што си ти? с места би му отговорно: я сам болгарин, а свој језик зову болгарским...", p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Bulgarian" for various Macedonian dialects can be seen from early vernacular texts such as the four-language dictionary of Daniil of Moschopole, the early works of Kiril Pejchinovich and Ioakim Kurchovski and some vernacular gospels written in the Greek alphabet. These written works influenced by or completely written in the Bulgarian vernacular were registered in Macedonia in the 18th and beginning of the 19th century and their authors referred to their language as Bulgarian.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Dr. Gustav Weigand, ETHNOGRAPHIE VON MAKEDONIEN, Geschichtlich-nationaler, spraechlich-statistischer Teil, Leipzig, Friedrich Brandstetter, 1924.&lt;/ref&gt; The first samples of Bulgarian speech and the first grammar of modern Bulgarian language were written by the leading Serbian literator Vuk Karadjić on the basis of the Macedonian Razlog dialect.&lt;ref&gt;Vuk Karadjić. ''Dodatak k sanktpeterburgskim sravniteljnim rječnicima sviju jezika i narječja sa osobitim ogledom Bugarskog језика''. Vienna, 1822.&lt;/ref&gt; In those early years the re-emerging Bulgarian written language was still heavily influenced by Church Slavonic forms so dialectical differences were not very prominent between the Eastern and Western regions. Indeed, in those early years many Bulgarian activists sometimes even communicated in Greek in their writing.

When the Bulgarian national movement got under way in the second quarter of the 19th century some cities in Macedonia were among the first to demand education in Bulgarian and Bulgarian-speaking clerics for their churches.&lt;ref&gt;F. A. K. Yasamee "NATIONALITY IN THE BALKANS: THE CASE OF THE MACEDONIANS" in ''Balkans: A Mirror of the New World Order'', Istanbul: EREN, 1995; pp. 121-132.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s however, it was clear that the Central Balkan regions of Bulgaria were assuming leadership in linguistic and literary affairs. This was to a large extent due to the fact that the affluent towns on both sides of the Central Balkan range were able to produce more intellectuals educated in Europe than the relatively more backward other Bulgarian regions. Consequently, when the idea that the vernacular rather than Church Slavonic should be represented in the written language gained preponderance, it was the dialects of the Central Balkan region between [[Veliko Tarnovo]] and [[Plovdiv]] that were most represented.&lt;ref name="Strukova1"&gt;Струкова, К. П. ''Общественно-политическое развитие Македонии в 50-70-е гг XIX века'', Российская Академия наук, Москва 2004, стр. 85-136. {{ISBN|5-7576-0163-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some prominent Bulgarian educators from Macedonia like [[Parteniy Zografski]] and [[Kuzman Shapkarev]] called for a stronger representation of Macedonian dialects in the Bulgarian literary language but their advice was not heeded at the time and sometimes met with hostility.&lt;ref name="Strukova1"/&gt; In the article ''[[s:The Macedonian question|The Macedonian Question]]'' by [[Petko Slaveykov|Petko Rachev Slaveykov]], published on 18 January 1871 in the [[Makedoniya (newspaper)|''Makedoniya'']] newspaper in Constantinople, [[Macedonism]] was criticized, his adherents were named Macedonists, and this is the earliest surviving indirect reference to it, although Slaveykov never used the word ''Macedonism''.The term's first recorded use is from 1887 by [[Stojan Novaković]] to describe Macedonism as a potential ally for the Serbian strategy to expand its territory toward Macedonia, whose population was regarded by almost all neutral sources as Bulgarian at the time.
The consternation of certain Macedonians with what they saw as the domineering attitude of Northern Bulgarians towards their vernacular was later deftly exploited by the Serbian state, which had begun to fear the rise of Bulgarian nationalism in Macedonia.

Up until 1912/18 it was the standard Bulgarian language that most Macedonians learned (and taught) in the Exarchate schools. All activists and leaders of the Macedonian movement, including those of the left, used standard Bulgarian in documents, press publications, correspondence and memoirs and nothing indicates they viewed it as a foreign language.&lt;ref&gt;''Как пишеха народните будители и герои'', Иван Михайлов&lt;/ref&gt; This is characteristic even of the members of [[IMRO (United)]] well into the 1920s and 1930s, when the idea of a distinct Macedonian nation was taking shape.&lt;ref&gt;Димитър Влахов ''Борбите на македонския народ за освобождение'', Библиотека Балканска Федерация, № 1, Виена; [[Dimitar Vlahov]], "The liberation struggle of the Macedonian people"&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1930s onwards the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Comintern sought to foster a separate Macedonian nationality as a means of achieving autonomy for Macedonia within a Balkan federation. Consequently, it was Bulgarian-educated Macedonians who were the first to develop a distinct Macedonian language, culture and literature.&lt;ref&gt;Доц. д-р Петър Галчин "МАКЕДОНСКИ ЛИТЕРАТУРЕН КРЪЖОК (1938–1941 г.)" ,''Македонски Преглед'', София, бр. 1 &amp; 2, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Юлия Митева, [http://liternet.bg/publish8/iumiteva/ezika.htm "Идеята за езика в Македонския литературен кръжок - естетически и идеологически аспекти"]&lt;/ref&gt; When Socialist Macedonia was formed as part of Federal Yugoslavia, these Bulgarian-trained cadres got into a conflict over the language with the more Serbian-leaning activists, who had been working within the Yugoslav Communist Party. Since the latter held most of the political power, they managed to impose their views on the direction the new language was to follow, much to the dismay of the former group.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S. and R. King, ''Yugoslav Communism and the Macedonian Question'', Archon Books, 1971, p. 137. {{ISBN|0-208-00821-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dennis P. Hupchick]], American professor of history, states that "the obviously plagiarized historical argument of the Macedonian nationalists for a separate Macedonian ethnicity could be supported only by linguistic reality, and that worked against them until the 1940s. Until a modern Macedonian literary language was mandated by the socialist-led partisan movement from Macedonia in 1944, most outside observers and linguists agreed with the Bulgarians in considering the vernacular spoken by the Macedonian Slavs as a western dialect of Bulgarian".&lt;ref&gt;Dennis P. Hupchick, ''Conflict and Chaos in Eastern Europe'', Palgrave Macmillan, 1995, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1944 the communist-dominated government sought to create a Bulgarian-Yugoslav federation (see [[Balkan Communist Federation]]) and part of this entailed giving "cultural autonomy" to the Pirin region. Consequently, Bulgarian communists recognised the Macedonian language as distinct from Bulgarian.&lt;ref name="Mahon_389_407"&gt;Mahon, M. (1998) "The Macedonian question in Bulgaria" in ''[[Nations and Nationalism (journal)|Nations and Nationalism]]''. Vol. 4, No. 3, pp. 389-407&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Tito-Stalin split]] in 1948, those plans were abandoned. This date also coincided with the first claims of Bulgarian linguists as to the [[Serbianisation]] of the Macedonian language.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, V. (1998) "The implementation of standard Macedonian: problems and results" in ''International Journal of the Sociology of Language''. Issue 131. pp. 31-57&lt;/ref&gt; Officially Bulgaria continued to support the idea of a [[United Macedonia|Macedonian unification]] and a Macedonian nation but within the framework of a Balkan Federation and not within Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer and King, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; However, a reversal in the [[Macedonisation]] policy was already announced in the secret April plenum of the BCP in 1956 and openly proclaimed in the plenum of 1963. 1958 was the first time that a "serious challenge" to the Macedonian position was launched by Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer and King, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; These developments led to violent polemics between Yugoslav and Bulgarian scholars and sometimes reflected on the bilateral relations of the two countries.&lt;ref name="Mahon_389_407"/&gt;

== Macedonian view ==
According to the Macedonian view, now prevalent and official in the books in Republic of Macedonia,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Macedonian was the first official language of the Slavs{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}, thanks to the [[St. Cyril and St. Methodius]]'s introduction of [[Church Slavonic|Slavic literacy language]] through the [[Glagolitic]] script, that was based on Southern Macedonian dialect from the neighbourhood{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} of [[Thessaloniki]], the home of the two saints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056967?query=church%20slavonic%20macedonian&amp;ct= Encyclopædia Britannica - Old Church Slavonic language] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221104920/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9056967?query=church%20slavonic%20macedonian&amp;ct= |date=2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Macedonia fell under the rule of Bulgarians, and the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantines]] regarded all Slavic Macedonians as Bulgarians. According to a minority view, supported in the Republic of Macedonia, [[Tsar Samuil of Bulgaria|Tsar Samuil]]'s realm in the early [[Middle Ages]] was allegedly the first Macedonian Slavic state.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, [[Krste Misirkov]], who allegedly set the principles of the Macedonian literary language in the late 19th century, stated: "We speak a Bulgarian language and we believed with Bulgaria is our strong power."&lt;ref&gt;Misirkov, K. "On the Macedonian Matters", Sofia 1903&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of the Ottoman Empire, Serbia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Greece were all under Ottoman reign. During the nineteenth century, the primary source of identity was religion.&lt;ref name="home.uchicago.edu"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Friedman|first1=Victor|title=Linguistic Emblems and Emblematic Languages: On Language as Flag in the Balkans|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~vfriedm/Articles/Book003Friedman99.pdf|publisher=Department of Slavic and East European Languages, The Ohio State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Slavs in the geographical regions of Macedonia and Bulgaria were both Orthodox Christian and the Greek Orthodox Church was attempting to Hellenize the population, Macedonian and Bulgarian intellectuals banded together to establish a Slavic literary language in opposition to Greek.&lt;ref name="home.uchicago.edu"/&gt; Two competing centers of literacy rose at the beginning of the nineteenth century: southwestern Macedonia and northeastern Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="home.uchicago.edu"/&gt; These centers were different enough at every linguistic level to be competing to become the literary language. When the Bulgarian Exarchate was recognized as a millet on par with the Greek millet (on religious grounds), the designation Bulgarian was still a religious term, in opposition to Greek, and the language began to be standardized on the basis of the Bulgarian center of literacy.&lt;ref name="home.uchicago.edu"/&gt; Intellectuals from the Macedonian center of literacy felt that their dialects were being excluded from the literary Bulgarian language.&lt;ref name="home.uchicago.edu"/&gt; By the time the Bulgarian state gained independence in 1878, the population of Macedonia and Bulgaria was subjected to conflicting claims from the Serbian, Bulgarian, and Greek states and churches, which provided education, and a distinct Macedonian national identity was written about in print.&lt;ref name="home.uchicago.edu"/&gt; By 1903, a separate Macedonian identity and language is solidified in the works of Krste Petkov Misirkov, who advocates for a distinct Macedonian literary language.&lt;ref name="home.uchicago.edu"/&gt;

== Bulgarian view ==
[[File:Istoria-slavianobolgarskaia.jpg|left|thumb|150px|A page from [[Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya|Slavonic-Bulgarian History]], written in 1762 by Macedonia-born [[Saint Paisius of Hilendar]].]]

Although Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of the Republic of Macedonia, most of its academics, as well as the general public, regard the language spoken there as a form of Bulgarian.&lt;ref name="Mahon_389_407"/&gt; However, after years of diplomatic impasse caused by an academic dispute, in 1999 the government in Sofia solved the problem with the Macedonian Language under the formula: "the official language of the country (Republic of Macedonia) in accordance with its constitution".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aimpress.ch/dyn/trae/archive/data/199902/90222-005-trae-sof.htm 1999/02/22 23:50 Bulgaria Recognises Macedonian Language]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Bulgarian linguists consider the Slavic dialects spoken in the [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] as a part of the [[Bulgarian dialects|Bulgarian dialect area]].&lt;ref name="unity"&gt;{{cite book |author=Institute of Bulgarian Language |title=Единството на българския език в миналото и днес |publisher=[[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] |year=1978 |page=4 |language=Bulgarian |location=[[Sofia]] |oclc=6430481}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stoykov"&gt;{{cite book |title=Българска диалектология (Bulgarian dialectology)|last=Стойков (Stoykov)|first=Стойко |authorlink=Stoyko Stoykov |origyear=1962 |year=2002 |location=София |publisher=Акад. изд.

Russian scholars cite the early references to the language in Slavic literature from the middle of 10th century to the end of 19th century as "bulgarski" or "bolgarski" as proof of that claim.&lt;ref name="Strukova1"/&gt; From that, the conclusion is drawn that modern standard Macedonian is not a language separate from Bulgarian either but just another written "norm" based on a set of Bulgarian dialects. See [[dialect]] and [[dialect continuum]] to assess the validity of these arguments.

Moreover, Bulgarian linguists assert that the Macedonian and Yugoslav linguists who were involved in codifying the new language artificially introduced differences from literary Bulgarian to bring it closer to Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/ik/ik_2.html Ив. Кочев и Ив. Александров, ''ДОКУМЕНТИ ЗА СЪЧИНЯВАНЕТО НА МАКЕДОНСКИЯ КНИЖОВЕН ЕЗИК''] {{bg icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also said to have resorted to falsifications and deliberate misinterpretations of history and documents in order to further the claim that there was a consciousness of a separate Macedonian ethnicity before 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Коста Църнушанов, ''Македонизмът и съпротивата на Македония срещу него'', Унив. изд. "Св. Климент Охридски", София, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Although the original aim of the codifiers of Macedonian was to distance it from both Bulgarian and Serbian{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}, Bulgarians today view the standard Macedonian language as heavily Serbianised, especially with regards to its vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=53oBuYEjF9EC&amp;pg=PA187 ''Europe since 1945: an encyclopedia''], Author Bernard A. Cook, Publisher Taylor &amp; Francis, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8153-4058-3}}, p 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgarian scholars such as Kosta Tsrnushanov claim there are several ways in which standard Macedonian was influenced by Serbian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/statii/mp_1991_1_tsyrnushanov.html Сърбизиране на македонския казионен литературен език, сп.

This formulation was detailed in 1978 in a document of the [[Bulgarian Academy of Sciences]] entitled "The Unity of the Bulgarian Language Today and in the Past".&lt;ref name="Mahon_389_407"/&gt; Although Bulgaria was the first country to recognize the independence of the [[Republic of Macedonia]], it has refused to recognise the existence of a separate Macedonian ethnicity and a separate Macedonian language. This was a major obstacle to the development of diplomatic relations between the two countries until a compromise solution was worked out in 1999.

== Serbian view ==
[[Serbia]] officially recognises the Macedonian Language as separate language to [[Bulgarian Language|Bulgarian]]. In the 2002 census c.26,000 people declared themselves as [[Ethnic Macedonians|Macedonians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://webrzs.stat.gov.rs/zip/esn31.pdf SN31]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Greek view ==
From the [[Greece|Greek]] point of view, there can be only one meaning for the term ''Macedonia'', and that is in reference to ancient [[Macedon]] and the modern Greek region of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Danforth, L. (1997) The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World (Princeton : Princeton University Press) {{ISBN|0-691-04356-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It follows that the term cannot properly be used for a Slavic language.

Demetrius Andreas Floudas, Senior Associate of [[Hughes Hall, Cambridge]], explains that it was only in 1944 that [[Josip Broz Tito]], in order to increase his regional influence, gave to the southernmost province of [[Yugoslavia]] (hitherto officially known as [[Vardarska banovina]]) the new name of [[People's Republic of Macedonia]]. At the same time, in a "political master-stroke",&lt;ref&gt;Floudas, Demetrius Andreas; {{cite web |publisher= in: Kourvetaris et al. (eds.), ''The New Balkans'', East European Monographs: Columbia University Press, 2002, p. 85 |url=http://www.intersticeconsulting.com/documents/FYROM.pdf | title= Pardon? A Name for a Conflict? FYROM's Dispute with Greece Revisited|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; the local language - which was until
then held to be a [[Bulgarian dialects|western Bulgarian]] dialect - was unilaterally christened "Macedonian" and became one of Yugoslavia's official
languages. {{ref|Floudas}} Greece similarly [[Macedonia naming dispute|rejects]] the name "[[Republic of Macedonia]]", seeing it as an implicit territorial claim on the whole of the region.

Books have been published in Greece which purport to expose the artificial character of the Macedonian language.&lt;ref&gt;Roudometof, V. (1996) "Nationalism and Identity Politics in the Balkans: Greece and the Macedonian Question" in ''Journal of Modern Greek Studies'' Vol. 14, pp.&amp;nbsp;253–302.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Greeks believe that the [[Slavic dialects of Greece|Slavic dialects]] spoken in Greek Macedonia are actually a mixture of Slavic and Greek [http://www.uoc.es/euromosaic/web/document/macedoni/fr/i1/i1.html] (''see [[Slavic language (Greece)]]'').

== Other views ==
Linguists outside of Macedonia and Bulgaria subscribe either to a pro-Macedonian or a pro-Bulgarian view.

Illustrating the pro-Macedonian view is [[Horace Lunt]], a [[Harvard]] professor, who wrote the first English language [[grammar]] of the Macedonian language in the early 1950s: "Bulgarian scholars, who argue that the concept of a Macedonian language was unknown before World War II, or who continue to claim that a Macedonian language does not exist look not only dishonest, but silly, while Greek scholars who make similar claims are displaying arrogant ignorance of their Slavic neighbours"; (Lunt 1984:110, 120). Similarly, [[Loring Danforth]], professor of Anthropology at [[Bates College]] in Lewiston, Maine, addresses the stance of linguists, who attribute the origin of the Macedonian language to their will, stressing that all languages in the standardisation process have a certain political and historical context to them and the fact that Macedonian language had a political context in which it was standardised doesn't mean it's not a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.net.au/rn/linguafranca/stories/2008/2214064.htm | title = Macedonia and the language of nationalism | accessdate = Nov 8, 2008 | last = Danforth | first = Loring | date = April 12, 2008 | format = radio debate | publisher = Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illustrating the pro-Bulgarian view, Italian linguist Vittore Pisani stated "the Macedonian language is actually an artifact produced for primarily political reasons".&lt;ref&gt;Pisani, V. "Il Macedonico, Paideia, Rivista Letteraria di informazione bibliografica", vol. 12, p.&amp;nbsp;250, 1957&lt;/ref&gt; German linguist Friedrich Scholz, argues that the Macedonian national consciousness and from that conscientious promotion of Macedonian as a written language, first appears just in the beginning of our century and is strengthened particularly during in the years between the two world wars.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Scholz, ''Slavische Etymologie'', Harrassowitz, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Austrian linguist Otto Kronsteiner, states that the Macedonian linguists artificially introduced differences from the literary Bulgarian language to bring Macedonian closer to Serbian, jesting that the Macedonian language is a Bulgarian one, but written on a Serbian typewriter.&lt;ref&gt;Der Zerfall Jugoslawiens und die Zukunft der makedonischen Literatursprache: Der späte Fall von Glottotomie?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4798">'''Probabilistic design''' is a discipline within [[engineering design]]. It deals primarily with the consideration of the effects of [[random variable|random variability]] upon the performance of an [[engineering system]] during the design phase. Typically, these effects are related to quality and reliability. Thus, probabilistic design is a tool that is mostly used in areas that are  concerned with quality and [[reliability engineering|reliability]]. For example, product design, quality control, systems engineering, [[machine design]], [[civil engineering]] (particularly useful in [[limit state design]]) and manufacturing. It differs from the classical approach to design by assuming a small probability of failure instead of using the [[safety factor]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

When using a probabilistic approach to design, the designer no longer thinks of each variable as a single value or number. Instead, each variable is viewed as a [[probability distribution]]. From this perspective, probabilistic design predicts the flow of variability (or distributions) through a system. By considering this flow, a designer can make adjustments to reduce the flow of random variability, and improve quality. Proponents of the approach contend that many quality problems can be predicted and rectified during the early design stages and at a much reduced cost.

==The objective of probabilistic design==
Typically, the goal of probabilistic design is to identify the design that will exhibit the smallest effects of random variability. This could be the one design option out of several that is found to be most robust. Alternatively, it could be the only design option available, but with the optimum combination of input variables and parameters. This second approach is sometimes referred to as [[robustification]], parameter design or [[Design for Six Sigma|design for six sigma]]

==Methods used==
Essentially, probabilistic design focuses upon the prediction of the effects of random variability. Some methods that are used to predict the random variability of an output include:

*the [[Monte Carlo method]] (including [[Latin hypercube sampling|Latin hypercubes]]);
*[[propagation of error]];
*[[design of experiments]] (DOE)
*[[method of moments (statistics)|the method of moments]]
*[[Statistical interference]]
*[[quality function deployment]]
*[[Failure mode and effects analysis]]

[[File:Charlemagne-by-Durer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charlemagne]] holds a sword in his proper right hand, on the "viewer's left", and an [[Globus cruciger|orb]] in his proper left hand.]] 
[[File:Orestes (1848).jpg|thumb|Statue holding a sword in its proper right hand]]
'''Proper right''' and '''proper left''' are conceptual terms used to unambiguously convey [[relative direction]] when describing an image or other object. The "proper right" hand of a figure is the hand that would be regarded by that figure as its right hand.&lt;ref&gt;"For figurative works, use the abbreviations PR (proper right) and PL (proper left) to indicate the right or left side of the statue from the perspective of the statue (i.e., your right or left side if you were positioned on the base facing in the same direction as the statue)" - p. 34, [http://www.heritagepreservation.org/PDFS/SOSvolunteerHandboook.pdf Save Outdoor Sculpture! Volunteer Handbook]. ("Save Outdoor Sculpture! (SOS!) is a joint project of the National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, and the National Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Property").&lt;/ref&gt; In a frontal representation, that appears on the left as the viewer sees it, creating the potential for ambiguity if the hand is just described as the "right hand".

The terms are mainly used in discussing images of humans, whether in [[art history]], medical contexts such as [[x-ray]] images, or elsewhere, but they can be used in describing any object that has an unambiguous front and back (for example [[furniture]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=gNN1vgkxzicC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;dq=%22proper+right%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vw6iUuHRPKrm7Ab4moHYCA&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22proper%20right%22&amp;f=false ''The Furniture of John Shearer, 1790-1820: 'A True North Britain' in the Southern Backcountry'']&lt;/ref&gt;) or,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/RELAWM00539/ though see this somewhat puzzling example], which appears just to refer to the specific image, with the side shown the "front".&lt;/ref&gt; when describing things that move or change position, with reference to the original position. However a more restricted use may be preferred, and the internal instructions for cataloguing objects in the "Inventory of American Sculpture" at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]] say that "The terms "proper right" and "proper left" should be used when describing figures only".&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/research/programs/inventory/report_form_guidelines.pdf Smithsonian American Art Museum], "Inventorying" section.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[heraldry]], right and left is always used in the meaning of proper right and proper left, as for the imaginary bearer of a coat of arms; to avoid confusion, the Latin terms [[dexter and sinister]] are often used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bedingfeld|first1= Henry|author1-link= Henry Bedingfeld|last2= Gwynn-Jones|first2= Peter|author2-link= Peter Gwynn-Jones|page= 42|title= Heraldry|year= 1993|location= Leicester|publisher= Magna Books|isbn= 1-85422-433-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternative is to use language that makes it clear that the viewer's perspective is being used. The swords in the illustrations might be described as: "to the left as the viewer sees it", "at the view's left", "at the viewer's left", and so on.  However these formulations do not work for freestanding sculpture in the round, where the viewer might be at any position around the sculpture.  A British 19th-century manual for military drill contrasts "proper left" with "present left" when discussing the orientation of formations performing intricate movements on a parade ground, "proper" meaning the orientraion at the start of the drill.&lt;ref&gt;''Brigade drill, as established by order in the Field exercise and evolutions of infantry, as revised in 1859. With remarks and references, by W.N. Hutchinson'', 1860, War Office, [https://books.google.com/books?id=UU4BAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22proper+right%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vw6iUuHRPKrm7Ab4moHYCA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22proper%20right%22&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms are analogous to the nautical [[port and starboard]], where "port" is to a watercraft as "proper left" is to a sculpture, and they are used for essentially the same reason. Their use obviates the need for potentially ambiguous language such as "my right," "your left," and so on, by expressing the direction in a manner that holds true regardless of the relative orientations of the object and observer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.17900 The origins of 'port' and 'starboard'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025011852/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/server/show/conWebDoc.17900 |date=2007-10-25 }} at the UK [[National Maritime Museum]] website&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example is [[stage right]] and left in the theatre, which uses the actor's orientation, "stage right" equating to the audience's "house left".

{{Refimprove|date=October 2013}}
'''''Rashomon''''' is the name of several different stage productions, all ultimately derived from works by [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]].

==Source material==
[[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]]'s two short stories "[[Rashomon (short story)|Rashomon]]" (1915), also known as "The Rashomon Gate", and "[[In a Grove]]" (1921), also known as "The Cedar Grove", were famously fused and adapted as the basis for [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s award-winning film ''[[Rashomon (film)|Rashomon]]'' (1950), screenplay by Kurosawa and frequent collaborator [[Shinobu Hashimoto]]. In 1951 the film won an honorary International Academy Award, following the success of the film in winning a [[Golden Lion]] award at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in the same year. The Kurosawa and Hashimoto screenplay deviates from Akutagawa's original stories in a number of ways, most notably by allowing a note of hope to triumph over Akutagawa's dark pessimism. 

Neither Akutagawa's story nor any of the plays based on it share anything with the popular traditional [[Rashōmon (Noh play)]] (c.1420) about a man who climbs the [[rajōmon]] gate to see if a demon is on top of it.

==Stage versions==
===Fay and Michael Kanin===
This 1959 Broadway adaptation by [[Fay Kanin|Fay]] and [[Michael Kanin]] ran for six months (January–June) at the Music Box Theatre, New York, starring husband and wife [[Rod Steiger]] and [[Claire Bloom]]. The Kanins' production was nominated for three Tony awards.

The Kanins' somewhat sentimental script sticks closely to the film, including elements added by Kurosawa that do not appear in Akutagawa's original short stories. The Kanins later went on to write the film screenplay for the Western ''[[The Outrage]]'', which also credits Kurosawa and Akutagawa (but not Hashimoto). ''The Outrage'' was one of several Westerns based on Kurosawa's films, most notably [[John Sturges]]' ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'', adapted from Kurosawa's historical epic ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' (1954), and [[Sergio Leone]]'s ground-breaking "[[Spaghetti western|Spaghetti Western]]" ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964). The Kanins' script was also staged on U.S. television as a "Play of the Week" (1960).

[[East West Players]] presented the first intimate staging of the Kanins' script, as their inaugural production in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastwestplayers.org/about_us/about_us.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717082523/http://www.eastwestplayers.org/about_us/about_us.htm |date=July 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

More modern adaptations of ''Rashomon'' have gone back to Akutagawa's original stories.

===Ivor Benjamin===
Ivor Benjamin's 1988 adaptation is from original translations by Jane Guaschi, then a language student at Sheffield University, U.K., and stays closer to the bleaker viewpoint of Akutagawa than the Kanins' version. This adaptation received its international premiere by [Storytellers Theatre Company] (no longer in operation), Ireland, 2005, for which the tour was nominated for two ESB/Irish Times 2005 Theatre Awards: [[Liam Halligan (director)|Liam Halligan]] for Best Director and [[Chisato Yoshimi]] for Best Costume Design.

The script has also been performed at Jackson's Lane Theatre, London, UK (1988), the University of the Philippines (2000), in Ashland, Oregon, USA (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytidings.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050106/ENTERTAIN/301069990 |title=The truth is slippery in ?

'''Société des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs de musique''' ('''SACEM''') is a [[France|French]] [[professional association]] collecting payments of artists’ rights and distributing the [[copyright|right]]s to the original [[songwriter]]s, [[composer]]s, and [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publisher]]s.

==History==
Composers [[Ernest Bourget]], [[Victor Parizot]] and [[Paul Henrion]] in Paris in 1847 (see [[1847 in music]]) succeeded in having payment made for their works which were being played in the leading café-concert at the time, [[Les Ambassadeurs (restaurant)|Les Ambassadeurs]]. The French courts recognized these legitimate rights founded in revolutionary laws. The provisional union of authors, composers and publishers of music was thus established in 1850, and one year later, the professional union became a society (société civile) of authors, composers, and publishers who divided the author’s rights collected amongst the members, and this rule has been maintained to the present day.

'''Subvertising''' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[subversion (political)|subvert]]'' and ''advertising'') is the practice of making spoofs or [[parody|parodies]] of [[corporation|corporate]] and [[politics|political]] [[advertising|advertisements]].&lt;ref name=state&gt;{{cite news |author=Alexander Barley|coauthors= |title=Battle of the image |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/153475 |quote=Subvertising is an attempt to turn the iconography of the advertisers into a noose around their neck. If images can create a brand, they can also destroy one. A subvert is a satirical version or the defacing of an existing advert, a detournement, an inversion designed to make us forget consumerism and consider instead social or political issues. |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |date=May 21, 2001 |accessdate=2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subvertisements may take the form of a new image or an alteration to an existing image or icon, often in a [[satire|satirical]] manner. A subvertisement can also be referred to as a [[meme hack]] and can be a part of [[social hacking]] or [[culture jamming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Clearing the Mindscape |url=http://www.adbusters.org/category/tags/subvertising |quote=So I think that, for me, "subvertising", or "culture jamming", as I call it, is the art of creating a new kind of cool. |newspaper=[[Adbusters]] |date=March 4, 2009 |accessdate=2010-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927050110/http://www.adbusters.org/category/tags/subvertising |archivedate=September 27, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Adbusters]]'', a [[Canada|Canadian]] magazine and a proponent of counter-culture and subvertising, "A well produced 'subvert' mimics the look and feel of the targeted ad, promoting the classic '[[double-take (comedy)|double-take]]' as viewers suddenly realize they have been duped. Subverts create [[cognitive dissonance]]. It cuts through the [[:wikt:hype|hype]] and glitz of our mediated reality and, momentarily, reveals a deeper truth within."

Subvertising is a type of ''advertising hijacking'' (''détournement publicité''), where [[détournement]] techniques developed in the 1950s by the French [[Letterist International]] and later used by the better-known [[Situationist International]] have been used as a contemporary critical form to re-route advertising messages.

In 1972, the logo of Richard Nixon's reelection campaign posters was subvertised with two x's in Nixon's name (as in the [[Exxon]] logo) to suggest the corporate ownership of the Republican party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Exxon Victorious |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903902,00.html |quote=One sure sign that Exxon has arrived as a brand name is that it has become the butt of cartoonists' jokes. For example, a cartoon in [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'' magazine]] shows a picture of the White House with a sign overhead emblazoned Nixxon. The caption: 'But it's still the same old gas'. |work=Time |date=March 5, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/04/stickers.election/ |title=Sore-Loserman: From political parody to charity's windfall.

==Notable instances==
At the 2015 Paris COP21 climate conference, the collective known as [[Brandalism]] installed 600 posters that attacked what they perceived as the hypocrisy of corporate sponsors.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/style/article/subvertising-ads-posters-billboards/index.html|title=The hackers using street ads to protest|date=23 March 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edouard Manet - The Absinthe Drinker - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[Édouard Manet]], ''The Absinthe Drinker'', c.1859]]
'''''The Absinthe Drinker''''' (French: ''Le Buveur d'absinthe'') is an early painting by [[Édouard Manet]], c.1859, considered to be his first major painting and first original work.

Manet became a student in the studio of [[Thomas Couture]] from 1850 but grew to dislike his master's Salon style and thereafter set up his own studio in 1856.   Little of Manet's earliest work survives and much may have been destroyed by Manet himself.

''The Absinthe Drinker'' is a full-length portrait of an alcoholic ''chiffonnier'' ([[rag-picker]]) named Collardet who frequented the area around the [[Louvre]] in Paris. Collardet is painted in mostly brown, grey and black tones.  The subject is standing, wears a black [[top hat]] and is wrapped in a brown [[cloak]], like an aristocrat; he leans on a ledge with the empty bottle discarded on the floor by his feet.  Manet later added a half-full glass of [[absinthe]] on the ledge.  Influenced by the [[Realism (arts)|realism]] of [[Gustave Courbet]], the work shows a mundane subject on a large scale, measuring {{convert|180.5|cm}} high by {{convert|105.6|cm}} wide.  Manet may have taken inspiration from the poem ''Le Vin de chiffonniers'' ("The rag-picker's wine") in [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s 1857 collection ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'', from the paintings of ordinary people by [[Diego Velázquez]] (particularly his paintings of ''Aesop'' and ''Menippus''), and from [[Watteau]]'s ''L'Indifférent''.

Near the completion of the painting, Manet showed the work to his former master.  Asked for his opinion, Couture is said to have retorted: "An absinthe drinker!  And they paint abominations like that!  My poor friend, you are the absinthe drinker. It is you who have lost your moral sense." (quoted, for example, in Lainer, and in Adams).

''The Absinthe Drinker'' was the first work that Manet submitted to the [[Paris Salon]] in 1859.  It was rejected with only [[Eugène Delacroix]] voting in its favour. Part of the reason for its rejection may be its subject; absinthe was thought to be addictive and considered morally degenerate, and this was one of the earliest depictions of absinthe in art. The painting, however, also has technical faults; it is unevenly finished, with brushstrokes visible in places, and the legs join awkwardly with the subject's body.    Refusal of other works by young painters led eventually to the creation of the [[Salon des Refusés]] in 1863.

Manet continued to revise the work after 1859 and inserted the same cloaked figure into his 1862 painting ''[[The Old Musician]]''.  The original full-length portrait was cut down to three-quarter length by 1867 when it was exhibited by Manet with 56 other works in a self-funded retrospective at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]] held in Paris, but extended again by 1872 when Manet sold ''The Absinthe Drinker'' and 23 other works to the art dealer [[Paul Durand-Ruel]]. The glass of absinthe was a late addition, between 1867 and 1872.

The painting was sold to opera singer [[Jean-Baptiste Faure]] in 1906 and exhibited at the [[Statens Museum for Kunst]] in Copenhagen in 1914 when it was acquired for the Ny Carlsberg Foundation.  It was one of the first modern works added to the collection at the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]], where it is still held.

'''''The Death of Chione''''' is a 1622 painting by [[Nicolas Poussin]], his first known surviving work. He produced it during a stay in [[Lyon]] and in February 2016 it was acquired by that city's [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon|Museum of Fine Arts]]. It shows the death of [[Chione (daughter of Daedalion)|Chione]], lover of both [[Hermes]] and [[Apollo]] - she had compared her beauty to that of Apollo's sister [[Artemis]], who hunted her down and killed her by shooting an arrow through her tongue&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'', Book 11, lines 441-442&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects''' (Rome, 1995) is the international treaty on the subject of cultural property protection. It attempts to strengthen the main weaknesses of the 1970 UNESCO ''Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property''. The [[UNIDROIT]] Convention seeks to fight the illicit trafficking of cultural property by modifying the buyer's behaviour, obliging him/her to check the legitimacy of their purchase.

==Due diligence and Burden of Proof==
[[File:Claude monet - marina (MCM-RJ) 01.JPG|thumb|[[Claude Monet]]. ''Marina''. Painting stolen from the {{Interlanguage link multi|Museu da Chácara do Céu|pt}}, Rio de Janeiro, in 2006]]

The Convention states that if a cultural property was stolen it must be returned (Chapter II, Art. 3.1).&lt;ref name="Convention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/instruments/cultural-property/1995-convention|title=''UNIDROIT Convention on stolen or illegally exported  cultural objects''|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=UNIDROIT official website|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Any possessor deprived of his/her property will be compensated only if he/she can prove due diligence at the time of the purchase (Chapter II, Art. 4.1). The criteria for due diligence is listed under Article 4.4. of the Convention.

To assess the legitimacy of the object's origin, art market players can use international and national databases dedicated to cultural property protection, for instance, the INTERPOL Stolen Works of Art Database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Works-of-art/Database|title=Works of art / Works of art / Crime areas / Internet / Home - INTERPOL|last=|first=|date=2017-07-26|website=|publisher=Interpol.int|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; collects information about stolen cultural property and issues identification numbers to cultural objects.

Whereas Chapter II of the Convention deals with stolen cultural objects, Chapter III contemplates the export of cultural property in violation of national export restrictions. A State Party can request the competent Court of another Contracting State to order the return of a cultural object illegally exported from its territory if the removal of the object caused detriment in one of the ways listed under Article 5.3. Again, the burden of proof is on the possessor to demonstrate that he/she "neither knew nor ought reasonably to have known at the time of acquisition that the object had been illegally exported" (Art. 6.1).

These rules apply equally to cultural objects inherited or received as gifts. Either an heir or a beneficiary has the same responsibility as a buyer. Therefore, museums and other public institutions must carry out checks over the origin of donated objects.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-overview-e.pdf | title=The 1995 UNIDROIT Convention on Stolen or Illegally Exported Cultural Objects. An overview | publisher= UNIDROIT official website| accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 1970 UNESCO Convention and the 1995 UNIDROIT Convention==

The UNESCO ''Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property'' (1970 UNESCO Convention) and the UNIDROIT Convention are compatible and complementary. 
As distinct from the UNESCO Convention, the UNIDROIT Convention focuses on the recovery of cultural property. The UNIDROIT Convention establishes conditions for claims of restitution/return of stolen or illegally exported cultural objects respectively.

Although the UNIDROIT Convention follows key terminology of 1970 UNESCO Convention, cultural goods do not need to be defined as such by the State.

Furthermore, the term  "cultural property" is replaced by a more comprehensive "cultural object", but the list of their categories remains the same. The concept of "illicit export" is replaced by "illegal export",  which references a prohibitive law rather than a general forbiddance.

==Time Restrictions to Claims for Repatriation==
[[File:De Grashaven.jpg|thumb|[[Matthias Withoos]]. ''De Grashaven''. Stolen from [[Westfries Museum]], [[Hoorne]], in 2005]]

The Convention regulates the time period that an affected party may bring a claim for the restitution of stolen cultural property or the return of those illegally exported. 
Such a claim may be brought in three years from the time when the claimant knew the location of the cultural property and the identity of the possessor and in 50 years since the time of the theft (Art. 3.3). However, there are exceptions to this rule for stolen objects. 
Cultural objects that form an integral part of an identified monument or archaeological site, or which belong to a public collection are not subject to time limitation other than a period of three years (Art. 3.4). In addition, a Contracting State may declare that a claim warrants an extended time limit of 75 years or longer if so stated in its national law (Art. 3.5).&lt;ref name="convention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-e.pdf | title=UNIDROIT Convention on stolen or illegally exported  cultural objects | publisher= UNIDROIT official website| accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNIDROIT Convention is not a retroactive treaty. Its provisions only apply to cultural property stolen or illegally exported after the Convention entered into force (Art. 10).&lt;ref name="convention"/&gt; However the UNIDROIT Convention "does not in any way legitimise any illegal transaction of whatever which has taken place before the entry into force of this Convention" and does not "limit any right of a State or other person to make a claim under remedies available outside the framework" of the Convention (Art. 10.3).&lt;ref name="convention"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2603">In [[game theory]] an '''uncorrelated asymmetry''' is an arbitrary asymmetry in a game which is otherwise [[symmetric game|symmetrical]].  The name 'uncorrelated asymmetry' is due to [[John Maynard Smith]] who called payoff relevant asymmetries in games with similar roles for each player 'correlated asymmetries' (note that any game with correlated asymmetries must also have uncorrelated asymmetries).  

The explanation of an uncorrelated asymmetry usually makes reference to "informational asymmetry".  Which may confuse some readers, since, games which may have uncorrelated asymmetries are still games of [[complete information]] .  What differs between the same game with and without an uncorrelated asymmetry is whether the players know which role they have been assigned.  If players in a symmetric game know whether they are Player 1, Player 2, ''etc.'' (or row vs. column player in a [[bimatrix game]]) then an uncorrelated asymmetry exists.  If the players do not know which player they are then no uncorrelated asymmetry exists.  The [[information asymmetry]] is that one player believes he is player 1 and the other believes he is player 2.  Therefore, "informational asymmetry" does not refer to knowledge in the sense of an [[Information set (game theory)|information set]] in an [[extensive form game]].

The concept of uncorrelated asymmetries is important in determining which [[Nash equilibrium|Nash equilibria]] are [[evolutionarily stable strategies]] in discoordination games such as the [[game of chicken]].  In these games the mixing Nash is the ESS if there is no uncorrelated asymmetry, and the pure conditional Nash equilibria are ESSes when there is an uncorrelated asymmetry.  

The usual applied example of an uncorrelated asymmetry is territory ownership in the [[hawk-dove game]].  Even if the two players ("owner" and "intruder") have the same payoffs (i.e., the game is payoff symmetric), the territory owner will play Hawk, and the intruder Dove, in what is known as the 'Bourgeois strategy' (the reverse is also an ESS known as the 'anti-bourgeois strategy', but makes little biological sense).

'''World Sensorium''' is a natural and inclusive world scent, a work of [[olfactory art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John |last=Harris |title=Journal of Aesthetic Education |volume= 13| issue =  4 (Oct. 1979) |pages= 5–15 |jstor= 3331746}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="artnews1"&gt;{{cite web |first=Barbara |last=Pollack |title=Scents and Sensibility |publisher= ARTnews |date=March 2011 |url=http://www.artnews.com/2011/03/01/scents-sensibility/}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[interdisciplinary]] artist [[Gayil Nalls]], who is based in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview conducted by Dr. Avery Gilbert, First Nerve (online) |date=April 4, 2009 |url= http://firstnerve.com/2009/04/portrait-of-artist-gayil-nalls.html |publisher=firstnerve.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large-scale conceptual project and [[social sculpture]], the world scent comprises the most culturally significant scents of 225 countries combined proportionally according to the statistical population data of the year 2000. ''World Sensorium'' has been recognized by [[UNESCO]] and the [[President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities]] as a global peace project and has been internationally exhibited in large public events, museums and galleries since its creation in 1999.

The research for the creation of ''World Sensorium'' established smells from natural flora that triggered [[olfactory memory]] for the majority of people of each nation, with the goal of interpreting the relationship between world flora and human numbers on earth, and to bring new awareness of the living world and its influence on the [[human spirit]] and [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]]. Through this work, Nalls has sought to foster an understanding of the larger evolutionary [[social construct]] of knowledge we share with others via the [[senses]].

The project of ''World Sensorium'' can be categorized as a contribution to the genres of Olfactory Art and Aesthetics, [[Participatory art]], and [[environmental art]] and functions along the trajectories of avant-garde and political or activist art.

==Creative Inspiration==

===Berlin Wall===
Nalls envisioned this concept for a “world scent” in 1989, eleven years prior to its completion and debut release. She describes the moment of inspiration for the formula as having occurred on December 28 of that year at the Brandenberg Gate, as the crowd pulled her on top of the [[Berlin Wall]]. As the connectivity passed through the bodies gathered, she envisioned a formula for ''World Sensorium'' where everyone would be counted.

===Relationship to Permutatude Theory===
''World Sensorium'' was created for the aesthetic of mass anatomy to evoke global memory and to evolve a metabolic collective. [[Permutatude Theory]] and science form a significant background to the ongoing project, as do the processes of cultural transformation and globalization. As a theoretical construct, conceived to be an embodied consciousness of “one world” the olfactory sculpture critically engages individuals with their sense of smell, often in performative settings.

==Methodology==

===Determination of ingredients===
Historical scents of all the countries of the world, culturally significant in medicine, mythology, the arts, anthropology, spiritual practices, diet and memory were identified based on survey research to obtain quantitative information that supplied the raw data for the creation of the scent, establishing the constituent natural plant oils “from tree, flower, grass or herb”.&lt;ref&gt;G. Nalls, inscription on Times Square World Sensorium Papperworks, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  
	
Many of the plants were identified in local vernacular and required additional research to verify the Latin or English names. In some instances an English name did not exist.  “Nalls located botanical taxonomy scholars from the [[New York Botanical Garden]] and ethno-botanists from the [[National Tropical Botanical Garden]] in Hawaii to assist in properly identifying the botanical names”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resourcesforlivingwell.com/Articles/worldsensorium.html Kyle, Lorraine, ''World Sensorium: A Global Bouquet Attuning the Unity of All Cultures through Scent,]” NAHA Quarterly JJournal, Winter (2000)"&lt;/ref&gt; materials which had been referred to in colloquial terms such as, Senegal: Gowe ([[Cyperus articulatus]]), no English name, and American Samoa: Mos’oi ([[Cananga odorata]]), English name Ylang-ylang.

“The goal was to have to have each flora’s complex molecular compositions represented in its entirety so as to be perceived by humans as closely as it would if it were experienced in its habitat, in order to evoke the same psychological ad emotional responses, and neurological and immune functions as in the traditions of the culture.”&lt;ref&gt;(G. Nalls, "World Sensorium: Theory Practice and Significance of The World Social Olfactory Sculpture'', (dissertation), SmartLab, UEL, (September 2007) p.30)&lt;/ref&gt; To this end all raw materials were derived straight from botanical sources by means of distillation or extraction.

===Formula===
The composition of these ingredients was based on projected population percentages for each individual country for the year 2000. Everyone was counted.

==Impact as World Peace Project==

===Global communications===
In her quantitative research, Nalls crossed political boundaries in dialog with “countries the United States doesn’t get along with, such as Iran ([[rose]]), Iraq ([[date palm]]) Libya ([[orange blossom]]) and Cuba ([[tobacco]]).”&lt;ref&gt;Rita Giordano, “Artist to Unleash Global Scent of Peace Over Times Square,” The Denver Post, Denver, CO, December 29, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, communications spanned several months, but an especially “poignant moment in the creation of ''World Sensorium'' was the day the representative from the Israeli Embassy in Washington and the Palestinian representative from the united Nations called Nalls by phone within minutes of each other to report that their national choices were both the Olive tree because of its long revered association with peace.”&lt;ref&gt;Kyle, Lorraine, ''World Sensorium: A Global Bouquet Attuning the Unity of All Cultures through Scent,” NAHA Quarterly JJournal, Winter (2000)"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition and Honors===
In 1998, in recognition of Nalls’ outstanding creative achievement, ''World Sensorium'' was endorsed by the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities and was granted sponsorship by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as an original cultural initiative building goodwill and peace in conjunction with the United Nation's International Year for Culture of Peace. In his letter to Nalls, Director-General, Dr. Federico Mayor, a brain biochemist, said that ''World Sensorium'' is a “highly original cultural initiative” that “will certainly contribute to creating a climate of goodwill and peace at this memorable moment in time” leading to “understanding and collaboration among nations”.&lt;ref&gt;As stated in letter to Nalls, September 5, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural Significance==

===Olfactory Art and Aesthetics===
With ''World Sensorium'' and more recent works, Nalls has advanced concepts of aesthetics to consider the olfactory sense over the historically privileged sense of vision. While the visual remains dominant, artists have and are now increasingly working with the sense of smell to produce emotionally and phenomenologically resonant works in the emergent genre of Olfactory Art. Nalls “like many other olfactory artists, uses only natural fragrances and essential oils. “I call it ‘rewilding the mind,’” she says.&lt;ref name="artnews1"/&gt;

===Participatory Art===
For Nalls, the connection between olfaction and social or participatory art is rooted in the evolutionary biology of the sense of smell. As the oldest sense, olfaction has the uncanny ability to trigger memory (individual and collective), and its significant role in chemosensory communication is critical to the collective action that is necessary for participatory social and art processes. 
		
''World Sensorium'' is a participatory project in its all-inclusive ethos, Nalls’ intention for its en masse experience, and in its very creation which at times required to assistance of volunteers to gather the phytogenic materials.  “[[Randia aculeata]] an ingredient from the Netherlands 	Antilles, could only be found locally in Florida. A team was rushed to the site before Hurricane Lenny came in and swept through the area.” to harvest the leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Klepacki, “Times Square Revelers To Ring in New Fragrance,” Women’s Wear Daily, December 23, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avant-gardism and Political Art===
In its use of extant culturally significant plant materials, Nalls advances the advant-garde notion that art should be brought closer to the praxis of life. ''World Sensorium'' is all-inclusive in its conception–a reflection of actual human-plant relations, making every experience of ''World Sensorium'' a connection to the world's collective ecology and human consciousness. When experienced en masse as in Times Square, Nalls initiated a collective metabolic experience, and introduced a universal language for cross-cultural efforts toward peace, by evoking our co-evolution with nature. Ken Johnson called ''World Sensorium'' a "utopian project" and "an olfactory metaphor for world unity" by an "earnest and rather grandiose conceptualist".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Ken, Art in Review, New York Times, January 21, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition History==
