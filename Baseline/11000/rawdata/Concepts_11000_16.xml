'''''5 Broken Cameras''''' ({{lang-ar|خمس كاميرات محطمة}} ''Khamas Kamīrāt Muḥaṭṭamah''; {{lang-he|חמש מצלמות שבורות}} ''Hamesh Matslemot Shvurot'') is a 94-minute documentary film co-directed by Palestinian [[Emad Burnat]] and Israeli [[Guy Davidi]]. It was shown at film festivals in 2011 and placed in general release by [[Kino International (company)|Kino Lorber]] in 2012. ''5 Broken Cameras'' is a first-hand account of protests in [[Bil'in]], a [[West Bank]] village affected by the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]]. The documentary was shot almost entirely by Palestinian farmer Emad Burnat, who bought his first camera in 2005 to record the birth of his youngest son. In 2009 Israeli co-director Guy Davidi joined the project. Structured around the destruction of Burnat's cameras, the filmmakers' collaboration follows one family's evolution over five years of turmoil.&lt;ref name="Official Website"&gt;{{official website|http://www.kinolorber.com/5brokencameras}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film won a 2012 [[Sundance Film Festival]] award, it won the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130703112324/http://www.gaiff.am/en/home/ Golden Apricot]  at the 2012 [[Yerevan International Film Festival]], [[Armenia]], for Best Documentary Film, won the 2013 [[International Emmy Award]],&lt;ref name="International Emmy Award Official website"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Emmy Award Official website|url=http://www.iemmys.tv/awards_previous.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="'5 Broken Cameras' clinches International Emmy Award"&gt;{{cite web|title='5 Broken Cameras' clinches International Emmy Award, November 26, 2013, Haaretz|url=http://www.haaretz.com/life/arts-leisure/1.560211}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for a 2013 [[85th Academy Awards|Academy Award]].

==Synopsis==
There are five cameras — each with its own story. When his fourth son, Gibreel, is born in 2005, self-taught cameraman Emad Burnat, a Palestinian villager, gets his first camera. At the same time in his village of Bil’in, the Israelis begin bulldozing village olive groves to build a barrier to separate Bil'in from the Jewish Settlement Modi'in Illit. The barrier's route cuts off 60% of Bil'in farmland and the villagers resist this seizure of more of their land by the settlers.

During the next year, Burnat films this struggle, which is led by two of his best friends including his brother [[Iyad Burnat|Iyad]], while at the same time recording the growth of his son. Very soon, these events begin to affect his family and his own life. Emad films the Army and Police beating and arresting villagers and activists who come to support them. Settlers destroy Palestinian olive trees  and attack Burnat when he tries to film them. The Army raids the village in the middle of the night to arrest children. He, his friends, and brothers are arrested or shot; some are killed. Each camera used to document these events is shot or smashed.

Eventually, in 2009, Burnat approaches Guy Davidi&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=5 Broken Cameras: Guy Davidi Interview - TAKE ONE|url=http://www.takeonecff.com/2012/5-broken-cameras-guy-davidi-interview|accessdate=5 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; – an Israeli filmmaker and together, from these five broken cameras and the stories that they represent, these two filmmakers create the film.

==Production==

===Background and Emad Burnat===
Israel began construction of an [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] in the West Bank village of Bil’in, Palestine in 2005.&lt;ref name=barrier2&gt;{{cite web|last=Kershner|first=Isabel|title=Israeli Court Orders Barrier Rerouted|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/world/middleeast/05mideast.html|work=New York Times|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discovering that the wall would cut through their agricultural land, confiscating half of it, the villagers initiated popular protests and were joined by Israeli and international activists.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} At that point Burnat received a camera to document the movement.

In 2007 the [[Israeli Supreme Court]] ordered the barrier rerouted,&lt;ref name=barrier2/&gt; and four years later, after village access to some of the land was restored, the demonstrations were called off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=A.O.|title=A Palestinian Whose Cameras Are Witnesses and Casualties of Conflict|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/movies/5-broken-cameras-shows-life-in-one-palestinian-village.html?_r=0|website=New York Times|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://globalinitiative-escr.org/palestinian-villages-complaint-against-canada-registered-with-the-un-human-rights-committee/ A case against Canada], for failing to prevent Canadian corporations from being complicit in the building of the settlements, is currently pending before the UN Human Rights Committee.

The first year, Burnat filmed mainly to serve the purposes of activists. His footage was introduced as evidence in Israeli court and posted on [[YouTube]] to spread awareness of the growing movement.

As media interest in Bil’in grew, Burnat's footage gained international recognition and was used by local and international news agencies. He started working as a freelance photographer for Reuters and provided footage documenting the villagers' fight to professional filmmakers. This footage was used in such notable films as Shai Carmeli Pollac’s Bil’in, My Love and Guy Davidi’s and Alesandre Goetschmann Interrupted Streams.&lt;ref name="Official Website"/&gt;

===Pre-Production and Guy Davidi===
Burnat was approached in 2009 by Greenhouse, a Mediterranean film development project, to develop a documentary. The project focused on the non-violent movement and especially on Bassem Abu-Rahme, who was killed earlier that year at a demonstration in Bil’in. After some difficulties, Burnat approached Israeli filmmaker, Guy Davidi who had just finished editing “Interrupted Streams”, Davidi’s first feature documentary which was released in 2010 at the Jerusalem International Film Festival.

Earlier, Davidi had been involved in the left-wing organizations Indymedia and Anarchists Against the Wall.&lt;ref name=mag&gt;{{cite web| last =Goldman| first =Lisa| title ='5 Broken Cameras' director: There is no room for guilt - only taking responsibility| work =972 Magazine| date =Feb 24, 2013| url =http://972mag.com/director-of-5-broken-cameras-there-is-no-room-for-guilt-only-taking-responsibility/66642/}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Until my twenties,” Davidi has said in an interview, “it was very hard for me to work in Israel. I felt it was a very destructive environment, a very violent environment.... There is a lot of aggression expressed towards the arts in Israel. I connect it completely with the political situation....So I left for Paris and I found time to reflect on my life.... I kind of found a freedom in Paris and I wanted to express it as well in Israel. And ever since my life was connected with the West Bank.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Robbins| first =Jonathan| title =Interview With Guy Davidi, "5 Broken Cameras"| work =Film Society Lincoln Center| date =May 30, 2012| url =http://www.filmlinc.com/blog/entry/interview-with-guy-davidi-5-broken-cameras}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davidi provided Burnat's film with a new concept: Burnat himself, the cameraman, would be the protagonist, and the story would be told from his point of view. Davidi also proposed that the film be structured around the history of the destruction of Burnat's cameras. Footage that Burnat shot of his family was also incorporated into the film, thus enhancing the personal element.

Beginning in 2009, Burnat, adhering to the new concept for the film, focused more extensively on his family's reactions to events. A few important scenes shot by other cameramen (including Guy Davidi) were used to supplement the narrative, and to introduce Burnat as a character.&lt;ref name="Official Website"/&gt;

===Editing===
Starting in 2009, Davidi worked on the voice-overs and structuring the film. In 2011 French editor Véronique Lagoarde–Ségot joined the project to edit the final cut of the 90-minute film and to create the 52-minute television version. The film takes the form of a diary, and is divided into 5 sections, each of which recounts the story of one of the five cameras that Burnat used over the years.

In a prologue, Burnat is shown with his 5 broken cameras laid out on a table. This scene is returned to at the end of the film. Title cards identifying the time periods during which each camera was used are shown at the start of each episode as well as the epilogue. The story shifts frequently between the dramatic public events in the village and the highly intimate scenes involving Burnat's family.

The most prominent narrative is of Burnat's fourth son Gibreel, whose growth throughout almost 6 years is documented in the film. The birth of Gibreel occurs at the same time as the birth of the non-violent movement in the village; later in the film, Gibreel’s first words are “wall” and “cartridge,” uttered when he crosses the barrier with his brothers and finally writes his name on the second concrete wall at the end of the film.

Beginning with the episode involving the third camera, the personal and village movement narratives grow more integrated. Burnat becomes more conspicuous as a protagonist. First he is placed under house arrest and films himself, then he is filmed at the moment a bullet directly hits his third camera.&lt;ref name="Official Website"/&gt;

===Funding===
The film was initially developed by the [[Greenhouse Development Project]], a Mediterranean development project initiated by an Israeli foundation and sponsored by the European Union. Later it received funding from international and Israeli sources such as the New Israeli Cinema Fund (Israel), the Jan Vrijman Fund (Netherland), ITVS (USA). Still later, funding was provided by Israel's Channel 8, Dutch Television IKON, and sources in Canada, South Korea, and the UK. Ultimately French television and the CNC French Cinema Fund provided help. It was pitched at the 2010 [[Sheffield Doc/Fest]] MeetMarket.

==Reception==
''5 Broken Cameras'' has received positive reviews from numerous critics. It has a fresh rating of 95%, based on 39 reviews at [[Rottentomatoes.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{rottentomatoes|5_broken_cameras_2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A.O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' while stating that the film was “unlikely to persuade anyone with a hardened view of the issue to think again” and was a “hardly neutral...piece of advocacy journalism,” also said that it was  a "visual essay in autobiography and, as such, a modest, rigorous and moving work of art" that deserved "to be appreciated for the lyrical delicacy of [Burnat's] voice and the precision of his eye."&lt;ref name="NYT Critics' Pick"&gt;{{cite news |last=Scott |first=A.O. |authorlink=A.O. Scott |title=A Palestinian Whose Cameras Are Witnesses and Casualties of Conflict ‘5 Broken Cameras’ Shows Life in One Palestinian Village |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/movies/5-broken-cameras-shows-life-in-one-palestinian-village.html |accessdate=February 22, 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Artinfo]]'' magazine's [[J.

===Reception in Israel===
The film was released in Israel in July 2012 and immediately won the Best Documentary Award at the [[Jerusalem Film Festival]], where it competed against another Oscar-nominated film, "[[The Gatekeepers (film)|The Gatekeepers]]." The film also received an award named after the slain Palestinian-Israeli filmmaker [[Juliano Mer Khamis]], at the Cinema South Film Festival in Sderot. In Israel, 5 Broken Cameras received overwhelming positive reviews, with Timeout Israel calling it “a masterpiece” and Israeli film critic Shmulik Duvdevani naming it "the most important cinematic event of the year." Even Israel’s most popular right-wing newspaper, Israel Hayom, called the film "the best documentary of the year" (2012). Both directors, Guy Davidi and Emat Burnat, also appeared on the cover of the cultural weekend section of Israel’s leading newspaper, Yediot Achronot. In 2013 the film was nominated for the Israeli Film Academy's award ([[Ophir Award]]) for Best Documentary.

There was also considerable negative response to the film in Israel, however. Davidi said that when he first screened the film for Israeli high school students, “they got angry at me, accused me of lying and being a traitor. But the anger is really against the whole system that lied to them....So I tell the kids, ‘Go ahead and get mad at me. Take it all out on me. Soon you will realize that your anger is not against me, but against the whole system that lied to you.’”&lt;ref name=mag/&gt; According to the AP, the film “has infuriated people on both sides of the Israeli-Palestinian divide,” with some Israelis “asking why the government helped fund a film so scathing in its criticism of its own policies, while Palestinians are shocked that the film is winning accolades for being 'Israeli.'”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title ='5 Broken Cameras' angers both sides| work =SF Gate| date =Feb 13, 2013| url =http://www.sfgate.com/movies/article/5-Broken-Cameras-angers-both-sides-4276621.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli nonprofit Consensus petitioned the Israeli Attorney General claiming that Davidi and Burnat “should be charged with slander and prosecuted for 'incitement.'”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Shea| first =Danny| title =Guy Davidi, '5 Broken Cameras' Co-Director, Responds To Slander Claims: 'Disturbing' (VIDEO) | work =Huffington Post| date =Mar 14, 2013| url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/14/guy-davidi-5-broken-camer_n_2877779.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reaction to the Oscar Nomination in Israel===
When the film was nominated for an Oscar, the Israeli media referred to it as an Israeli film that would be representing Israel at the Academy Awards, even though the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences does not consider films nominated in the documentary category as representing their countries of origin. In addition, the fact that the film was also a Palestinian work often went unmentioned. Davidi sparked controversy and was criticized by Israeli officials when he stated in an interview that “he does not represent Israel, only himself.”

There was considerable controversy over whether the film should be identified as an Israeli or Palestinian production. Burnat described it as a “Palestinian film” while Davidi said it was “first and foremost...a Palestinian film,”although technically it was a “Palestinian-Israeli-French production since there is finance from these countries,” although he added: “I don’t think films should have citizenships.”&lt;ref name=elect&gt;{{cite web| last =Winstanley| first =Asa| title =Is Oscar-nominated 5 Broken Cameras an Israeli or a Palestinian film?| work =Electronic Intifada| date =Jan 11, 2013| url =http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/asa-winstanley/oscar-nominated-5-broken-cameras-israeli-or-palestinian-film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Issue of collaboration===
Burnat was widely criticized in Ramallah for working with Israelis, and Davidi was made to feel that “I had not sufficiently proved myself. I thought to myself that maybe we needed an Israeli activist to die in order to win credibility. Perhaps not enough Israeli blood has been spilled.”&lt;ref name=mag/&gt;

[[Norman Finkelstein]] attacked the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement for “flagrant hypocrisy” for not calling for a boycott of 5 Broken Cameras.&lt;ref name=elect/&gt;

==Awards==
''5 Broken Cameras'' won the World Cinema Directing Award at the [[2012 Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Sundance Film Festival Announces Awards |url=https://www.sundance.org/press-center/release/2012-sundance-film-festival-awards/ |accessdate=2012-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120428202931/http://www.sundance.org/press-center/release/2012-sundance-film-festival-awards/ |archivedate=2012-04-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it won the 2013 [[International Emmy Award]].&lt;ref name="International Emmy Award Official website"/&gt;&lt;ref name="'5 Broken Cameras' clinches International Emmy Award"/&gt; The film also received the Special Broadcaster IDFA Audience Award and the Special Jury Award at the [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=JVF film 5 Broken Cameras wins IDFA Audience Award|url=http://www.idfa.nl/industry/Festival/latest-news/the-jvf-film-5-broken-camera-wins-audience-award.aspx|accessdate=17 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202092442/http://www.idfa.nl/industry/Festival/latest-news/the-jvf-film-5-broken-camera-wins-audience-award.aspx|archive-date=2012-02-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the film won the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130703112324/http://www.gaiff.am/en/home/ Golden Apricot]  at the 2012 [[Yerevan International Film Festival]], for Best Documentary Film, the Van Leer Group Foundation Award for Best Israeli Documentary at the Jerusalem Film Festival in 2012, and the Busan Cinephile Award at the [[17th Busan International Film Festival]] in 2012.&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{cite web| title =5 Broken Cameras: Awards| work =IMDB| url =https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2125423/awards?ref_=tt_awd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also won Sheffield Doc/Fest Audience Award at the 2012 [[Sheffield Doc/Fest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-02-12|title=Sheffield Doc/Fest|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sheffield_Doc/Fest&amp;oldid=765154411|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of an '''archetype''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|k|ɪ|t|aɪ|p}} appears in areas relating to [[behavior]], [[History of psychology#Emergence of German experimental psychology|modern psychological theory]], and [[literary analysis]]. An archetype can be:

# a statement, pattern of behavior, or [[Prototype theory|prototype]] (model) which other statements, patterns of behavior, and objects copy or emulate. (Frequently used informal synonyms for this usage include "standard example", "basic example", and the longer form "archetypal example". Mathematical archetypes often appear as "[[canonical (disambiguation)|canonical]] examples".)
# a [[Platonic philosophy|Platonic philosophical idea]] referring to pure [[Theory of Forms|forms]] which embody the fundamental characteristics of a thing in Platonism
# a collectively-inherited unconscious idea, pattern of thought, image, etc., that is universally present, in individual psyches, as in [[Jungian psychology]]
# a constantly recurring symbol or motif in literature, painting, or mythology (this usage of the term draws from both [[Cultural anthropology|comparative anthropology]] and from [[Jungian archetypes|Jungian archetypal theory]]). In various seemingly unrelated cases in classic storytelling, media, etc., characters or ideas sharing similar traits recur.

The word ''archetype'', "original pattern from which copies are made", first entered into English usage in the 1540s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=archetype&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary - Archetype|author=Douglas Harper}}&lt;/ref&gt; and derives from the [[Latin]] [[noun]] ''archetypum'', [[Latinisation of Greek|latinisation]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] noun {{lang|grc|ἀρχέτυπον}} (''archétypon'')'','' whose [[adjective]] form is {{lang|grc|ἀρχέτυπος}} (''archétypos''), which means "first-molded",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29rxe%2Ftupos {{lang|grc|ἀρχέτυπος}}], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; which is a compound of {{lang|grc|ἀρχή}} ''archḗ'', "beginning, origin",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Da%29rxh%2F ἀρχή], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|τύπος}} ''týpos'', which can mean, amongst other things, "pattern", "model", or "type".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtu%2Fpos τύπος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
Usage of archetypes in specific pieces of writing is a holistic approach, which can help the writing win universal acceptance. This is because readers can relate to and identify with the characters and the situation, both socially and culturally. By deploying common archetypes contextually, a writer aims to impart realism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://literarydevices.net/archetype/|title=Online Literary Device - Archetype Function}}&lt;/ref&gt; to their work.
According to many literary critics, archetypes have a standard and recurring depiction in a particular human culture and/or the whole human race that ultimately lays concrete pillars and can shape the whole structure in a literary work.

==Plato==
{{Main|Theory of Forms}}
The origins of the archetypal hypothesis date as far back as [[Plato]]. Plato's ''ideas'' were pure mental forms that were imprinted in the soul before it was born into the world. They were collective in the sense that they embodied the fundamental characteristics of a thing rather than its specific peculiarities. In the seventeenth century, Sir [[Thomas Browne]] and [[Francis Bacon]] both employ the word 'archetype' in their writings; Browne in ''[[The Garden of Cyrus]]'' (1658) attempted to depict archetypes in his usage of symbolic proper-names.

==Jungian archetypes==
{{Main|Jungian archetypes}}

The concept of psychological archetypes was advanced by the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]], c. 1919. In Jung's psychological framework, archetypes are innate, universal prototypes for ideas and may be used to interpret observations. A group of memories and interpretations associated with an archetype is a [[Complex (psychology)|complex]] ( e.g. a mother complex associated with the mother archetype). Jung treated the archetypes as psychological organs, analogous to physical ones in that both are morphological constructs that arose through [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/jung.html| title = Carl Jung| first = C. George| last = Boeree| accessdate = 2006-03-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060206030011/http://www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/jung.html| archivedate= 6 February 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it has also been observed that evolution can itself be considered an archetypal construct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atpweb.org/jtparchive/trps-45-13-02-159.pdf Brown, R.S.(2013). Beyond the Evolutionary Paradigm in Consciousness Studies. The Journal of Transpersonal Psychology, 45.2, 159-171.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Jung states in part one of ''Man And His Symbols'' that:&lt;blockquote&gt;My views about the 'archaic remnants', which I call 'archetypes' or 'primordial images,' have been constantly criticized by people who lack a sufficient knowledge of the psychology of dreams and of mythology. The term 'archetype' is often misunderstood as meaning certain definite mythological images or motifs, but these are nothing more than conscious representations. Such variable representations cannot be inherited. The archetype ''is a tendency to form such representations'' of a motif—representations that can vary a great deal in detail without losing their basic pattern.&lt;/blockquote&gt;While there are a variety of categorizations of archetypes, Jung's configuration is perhaps the most well known and serves as the foundation for many other models. The four major archetypes to emerge from his work, which Jung originally terms ''primordial images,'' include the anima/animus, the self, the shadow, and the persona. Additionally, Jung referred to images of the wise old man, the child, the mother, and the maiden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Archetypes of the Collective Unconscious|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400850969.3|work=Collected Works of C.G. Jung, Volume 9 (Part 1): Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400850969|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He believed that each human mind retains these basic unconscious understandings of the human condition and the collective knowledge of our species in the construct of the collective unconscious.

Other authors have attributed 12 different archetypes to Jung, organized in three overarching categories, based on a fundamental driving force. These include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soulcraft.co/essays/the_12_common_archetypes.html|title=The 12 Common Archetypes|website=www.soulcraft.co|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dichter's application of archetypes ==
Later in the 1900s, a Viennese psychologist named Dr. [[Ernest Dichter]] took these psychological constructs and applied them to marketing. Around 1939, he moved to New York and sent every ad agency on Madison Avenue a famous letter boasting his new discovery. He found that applying these universal themes to products promoted easier discovery and stronger loyalty for brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Retail therapy.

== Story archetypes ==
Christopher Booker, author of ''The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57131450|title=The seven basic plots : why we tell stories|last=Christopher.|first=Booker,|date=2004|publisher=Continuum|year=|isbn=0826452094|location=London|pages=|oclc=57131450}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the following basic archetypes underlie all stories:
# Overcoming the Monster
# Rags to Riches
# The Quest
# Voyage and Return
# Comedy
# Tragedy
# Rebirth
These themes coincide with the characters of Jung's archetypes.

==Archetypal literary criticism==
{{Main|Archetypal literary criticism}}

Archetypal literary criticism argues that archetypes determine the form and function of literary works and that a [[text (literary theory)|text]]'s meaning is shaped by [[culture|cultural]] and [[psychology|psychological]] myths. Cultural archetypes are the unknowable basic forms personified or made concrete by recurring [[image]]s, [[symbol]]s, or [[pattern]]s (which may include motifs such as the "[[quest]]" or the "[[Ascent to Heaven|heavenly ascent]]"; recognizable character types such as the "[[trickster]]", "[[saint]]", "[[martyr]]" or the "[[hero]]"; symbols such as the apple or the snake; and imagery) and that have all been laden with meaning prior to their inclusion in any particular work.

The archetypes reveal shared roles among universal societies, such as the role of the mother in her natural relations with all members of the family. This archetype may create a shared imagery which is defined by many stereotypes that have not separated themselves from the traditional, biological, religious and mythical framework.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18919">'''Battered woman syndrome''' ('''BWS''') emerged in the 1990s from several murder cases in England in which women had killed violent partners in response to what they claimed was cumulative abuse, rather than in response to a single provocative act. Feminist groups, particularly [[Southall Black Sisters]] and [[Justice for Women]], challenged the legal definition of [[Provocation (legal)|''provocation'']], and in a series of appeals against murder convictions secured the courts' recognition of battered woman syndrome.&lt;ref name=Connelly2010p292&gt;{{cite book|last1=Connelly|first1=Clare|editor1-last=Hunter|editor1-first=Rosemary|editor2-last=McGlynn|editor2-first=Clare|editor3-last=Rackley|editor3-first=Erica|title=Feminist Judgments: From Theory to Practice|date=2010|publisher=Hart Publishing|location=Oxford|pages=(292–310), 292|chapter=Commentary on ''Attorney-General for Jersey v Holley''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bottomley1996p201&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bottomley|first1=Anne|title=Feminist Perspectives on The Foundational Subjects of Law|date=1996|publisher=Cavendish Publishing|location=London|p=201|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Magrath|first1=Paul|title=Law Report: Classic direction to jury on provocation defence upheld: R v Ahluwalia|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/law-report-classic-direction-to-jury-on-provocation-defence-upheld-r-v-ahluwalia-court-of-appeal-1538094.html|work=The Independent|date=3 August 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tan11July1995&gt;Ying Hui Tan (11 July 1995).

Walker]]'s ''The Battered Woman'' (1979).

==The law==
{{further|Provocation in English law}}

Until the mid-1990s, the legal definition of ''provocation'' in England had relied on [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Devlin J]] in ''R v Duffy'' [1949] 1 All ER 932: "Provocation is some act, or series of acts done (or words spoken)&amp;nbsp;... which would cause in any reasonable person and actually causes in the accused, a sudden and temporary loss of self-control, rendering the accused so subject to passion as to make him or her for the moment not master of his or her mind." Three cases helped to change this: [[Kiranjit Ahluwalia|''R v Ahluwalia'']] [1992] 4 AER 889; [[Emma Humphreys|''R v Humphreys'']] [1995] 4 All ER 1008); and ''[[Sara Thornton case|R v Thornton]] (No 2)'' [1996] 2 AER 1023.&lt;ref name=Connelly2010p292/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bottomley1996p201/&gt;

The courts in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States have accepted the extensive and growing body of research showing that battered women can use force to defend themselves and sometimes kill their abusers because of the abusive and sometimes life-threatening situation in which they find themselves, acting in the firm belief that there is no other way than to kill for self-preservation. The courts have recognized that this evidence may support a variety of defenses to a charge of [[murder]] or to mitigate the [[sentence (law)|sentence]] if convicted of lesser offenses. Battered woman syndrome is not a legal defense in and of itself, but may legally constitute:

* Self-defense when using a reasonable and proportionate degree of violence in response to the abuse might appear the most appropriate defense but, until recently, it almost never succeeded. Research in 1996 in England found no case in which a battered woman successfully pleaded self-defense (see Noonan at p. 198). After analysing 239 appellate decisions on trials of women who killed in self-defense in the U.S., Maguigan (1991) argues that self-defence is gender biased.
* [[provocation (legal)|provocation]];
* insanity (usually within the meaning of the [[M'Naghten Rules]]); and
* [[diminished responsibility]].

However, in 1994, as part of the [[Violence Against Women Act]], the [[United States Congress]] ordered an investigation into the role of battered woman syndrome expert testimony in the courts to determine its validity and usefulness.  In 1997, they published the report of their investigation, titled ''The Validity and Use of Evidence Concerning Battering and Its Effects in Criminal Trials''.  "The federal report ultimately rejected all terminology related to the battered woman syndrome...noting that these terms were 'no longer useful or appropriate{{'"}} (Rothenberg, "Social Change", 782).&lt;ref&gt;Rothenberg, Bess.  {{"'}}We Don't Have Time for Social Change’ Cultural Compromise and the Battered Woman Syndrome". ''Gender and Society'', Oct. 2003:771-87.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of using the term "battered woman", the terminology "battering and its effects" became acceptable. The decision to change this terminology was based on a changing body of research indicating there is more than one pattern to battering and a more inclusive definition was necessary to more accurately represent the realities of domestic violence.

==English law==
In ''R v Ahluwalia'' (1992) 4 AER 889 a woman ([[Kiranjit Ahluwalia]]), created [[napalm]] and set fire to the bed of her husband, Deepak, after he had gone to sleep. He suffered severe burns over 40% of his body and died 10 days later in the hospital. He allegedly had attempted to break her ankles and burn her with a hot iron on the night of her attack. Accusing him of [[domestic violence]] and [[marital rape]], she claimed provocation. The judge directed the jury to consider whether, if she did lose her self-control, a reasonable person having the characteristics of a well-educated married Asian woman living in England would have lost her self-control given her husband's provocation. On appeal, it was argued that he should have directed the jury to consider a reasonable person suffering from 'battered woman syndrome'. Having considered fresh medical evidence, the [[Court of Appeal (England and Wales)|Court of Appeal]] ordered a retrial on the basis that the new evidence showed an arguable case of [[diminished responsibility in English law]].&lt;ref&gt;''R v Ahluwalia'' (1992) 4 AER 889.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in ''[[Sara Thornton case|R v Thornton]] (No 2)'' (1996) 2 AER 1023 the battered wife adduced fresh evidence that she had a personality disorder and the Court of Appeal ordered a retrial considering that, if the evidence had been available at the original trial, the jury might have reached a different decision. The victim does not have to be in a position to carry out the threats immediately.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Thornton (No 2)'' (1996) 2 AER 1023.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''R v Charlton'' (2003) EWCA Crim 415, following threats of sexual and violent abuse against herself and her daughter, the defendant killed her obsessive, jealous, controlling partner while he was restrained by handcuffs, blindfolded and gagged as part of their regular sexual activity. The term of five years' imprisonment was reduced to three and a half years because of the terrifying threats made by a man determined to dominate and control the defendant's life. The threats created a genuine fear for the safety of herself and more significantly, her daughter, and this caused the defendant to lose control and make the ferocious attack.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Charlton'' (2003) EWCA Crim 415.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''HM's AG for Jersey v Holley'' (2005) 3 AER 371, the Privy Council regarded the Court of Appeal precedent in ''Smith''&lt;ref&gt;''R v Smith (Morgan)'' [1998] ''The Times'', 29 July 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; as wrongly decided, interpreting the Act as setting a purely objective standard. Thus, although the accused's characteristics were to be taken into account when assessing the gravity of the provocation, the standard of self-control to be expected was invariable except for the accused's age and sex. The defendant and the deceased both suffered from chronic [[alcoholism]] and had a violent and abusive relationship. The evidence was that the deceased was drunk and taunted him by telling him that she had sex with another man. The defendant then struck the deceased with an axe which was an accident of availability. Psychiatric evidence was that his consumption of alcohol was involuntary and that he suffered from a number of other psychiatric conditions which, independently of the effects of the alcohol, might have caused the loss of self-control and induced him to kill. Lord Nicholls said:
:Whether the provocative acts or words and the defendant's response met the 'ordinary person' standard prescribed by the statute is the question the jury must consider, not the altogether looser question of whether, having regard to all the circumstances, the jury consider the loss of self-control was sufficient excusable. The statute does not leave each jury free to set whatever standard they consider appropriate in the circumstances by which to judge whether the defendant's conduct is 'excusable'.&lt;ref&gt;''HM's AG for Jersey v Holley'' (2005) 3 AER 371.&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the passage of the [[Coroners and Justice Act 2009]], the defence of provocation—used in a number of the aforementioned cases—has been replaced with 'loss of control'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199696796.001.0001/acprof-9780199696796-chapter-8|title=Principles and Values in Criminal Law and Criminal Justice: Essays in Honour of Andrew Ashworth|last=Mitchell|first=Barry|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=113–132|language=en|chapter=Years of Provocation, Followed by a Loss of Control|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199696796.003.0008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law Commission Report on ''Partial Defences to Murder'' (2004) rejects the notion of creating a mitigatory defence to cover the use of excessive force in self-defence but accepts that the "all or nothing" effect of self-defence can produce unsatisfactory results in the case of murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawcom.gov.uk/app/uploads/2015/03/lc290_Partial_Defences_to_Murder.pdf The Law Commission Report on ''Partial Defences to Murder''] (2004), Part 4 (pp. 78-86).]&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=December 2017}}

==Australia==
In Australia, self-defence might be considered the most appropriate defence to a charge of murder for a woman who kills to protect her life or the lives of her children in a domestic violence context. It is about the rational act of a person who kills in order to save her (or his) own life.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite AustLII|HCA|75|1998|litigants=Osland v The Queen |parallelcite= |date=10 December 1998 |courtname=auto}}.

Under the new laws, victims of family violence will be able to put evidence of their abuse before the court as part of their defence, and argue self-defence even in the absence of an immediate threat, and where the response of killing involved greater force than the threatened harm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theage.com.au/news/national/end-draws-near-for-defence-of-provocation/2005/10/04/1128191716823.html The Age article].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste.

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] set a precedent for the use of the battered women defence in the 1990 case of ''[[R. v. Lavallee]]''.

==New Zealand==
In ''R v Fate'' (1998) 16 [[CRNZ]] 88 a woman who had come to [[New Zealand]] from the small island of [[Nanumea]], which is part of the [[Tuvalu Islands]], received a two-year sentence for manslaughter by provocation. Mrs. Fate spoke no English and was isolated within a small close-knit [[Wellington]] community of 12 families, so she felt trapped in the abusive relationship.&lt;ref&gt;''R v Fate'' (1998) 16 CRNZ 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, ''The Queen v Epifania Suluape'' (2002) [[NZCA]] 6, deals with a wife who pleaded provocation after she killed her husband with an axe when he proposed to leave her for another woman. There was some evidence of neglect, humiliation, and abuse but the court concluded that this was exaggerated. On appeal, the court was very conscious of the [[Samoa]]n culture in New Zealand in restricting the power of the wife to act independently of her husband and reduced her sentence for manslaughter to five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldlii.org/cgi-bin/disp.pl/nz/cases/NZCA/2002/6.html?query=tuvalu%2a ''The Queen v Epifania Suluape'' (2002) NZCA 6(21 February 2002)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6136">'''Bioaccumulation''' is the accumulation of substances, such as [[pesticides]], or other chemicals in an organism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bioaccumulation occurs when an organism absorbs a substance at a rate faster than that at which the substance is lost by [[catabolism]] and [[excretion]]. Thus, the longer the [[biological half-life]] of a [[Toxin|toxic substance]], the greater the risk of chronic [[poisoning]], even if [[Measured environmental concentration|environmental level]]s of the toxin are not very high.&lt;ref&gt;Bioaccumulation of Marine Pollutants [and Discussion], by G.

[[Bioconcentration]] is a related but more specific term, referring to uptake and accumulation of a substance from water alone. By contrast, bioaccumulation refers to uptake from all sources combined (e.g. water, food, air, etc.).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander|first=|date=|title=Bioaccumulation, bioconcentration, biomagnification|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F1-4020-4494-1_31|journal=|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

An example of poisoning in the workplace can be seen from the phrase "[[mad as a hatter]]" (18th and 19th century England). The process for stiffening the felt used in making hats more than a hundred years ago involved [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which forms organic species such as [[methylmercury]], which is lipid-soluble, and tends to accumulate in the brain, resulting in [[mercury poisoning]]. Other lipid-[[soluble]] (fat-soluble) poisons include [[tetraethyllead]] compounds (the [[lead]] in leaded [[petrol]]), and [[DDT]]. These compounds are stored in the body's [[fat]], and when the [[adipose tissue|fatty tissues]] are used for energy, the compounds are released and cause acute poisoning.

[[Strontium-90]], part of the [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] from [[atomic bomb]]s, is chemically similar enough to calcium that it is utilized in [[osteogenesis]], where its radiation can cause damage for a long time.

Naturally produced toxins can also bioaccumulate. The marine [[algal bloom]]s known as "[[red tide]]s" can result in local filter-feeding organisms such as [[mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s becoming toxic; coral fish can be responsible for the poisoning known as [[ciguatera]] when they accumulate a toxin called [[ciguatoxin]] from reef algae.

Some animal species exhibit bioaccumulation as a mode of defense; by consuming toxic plants or animal prey, a species may accumulate the toxin, which then presents a deterrent to a potential predator. One example is the [[Manduca sexta|tobacco hornworm]], which concentrates [[nicotine]] to a toxic level in its body as it consumes [[tobacco]] plants.
Poisoning of small consumers can be passed along the food chain to affect the consumers later on.
Other compounds that are not normally considered toxic can be accumulated to toxic levels in organisms. The classic example is of [[Vitamin A]], which becomes concentrated in [[carnivore]] [[liver]]s of e.g. [[polar bear]]s: as a pure carnivore that feeds on other carnivores (seals), they accumulate extremely large amounts of Vitamin A in their livers. It was known by the native peoples of the Arctic that the livers of carnivores should not be eaten, but Arctic [[explorer]]s have suffered [[Hypervitaminosis A]] from eating the bear livers (and there has been at least one example of similar poisoning of [[Xavier Mertz|Antarctic explorers]] eating [[husky]] [[dog]] livers).  One notable example of this is the expedition of [[Mawson|Sir Douglas Mawson]], where his exploration companion died from eating the liver of one of their dogs.

[[Coastal fish]] (such as the [[smooth toadfish]]) and [[seabird]]s (such as the [[Atlantic puffin]]) are often monitored for [[heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] bioaccumulation.

In some eutrophic aquatic systems, [[biodilution]] can occur. This trend is a decrease in a contaminant with an increase in trophic level and is due to higher concentrations of algae and bacteria to "dilute" the concentration of the pollutant.

&lt;!--NOTE: If you intend to add any information about the caduceus as a medical symbol, please read this article and 'Rod of Asclepius' article in their entirety first, as there is much confusion between the two.

[[File:Caduceus.svg|thumb|upright|Modern depiction of the caduceus as the symbol of commerce]]
[[File:Hermes Ingenui Pio-Clementino Inv544.jpg|thumb|upright|''Hermes Ingenui''&lt;ref&gt;It is unclear whether the inscription refers to a patron who paid for the statue, or to the sculptor of the statue.&lt;/ref&gt; carrying a winged ''caduceus'' upright in his left hand. A Roman copy after a Greek original of the 5th century BCE ([[Museo Pio-Clementino]], [[Rome]]).]]

The '''caduceus''' (☤; {{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|dj|uː|ʃ|ə|s|,_|-|s|i|ə|s}}; [[Latin]] ''cādūceus'', from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κηρύκειον}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|kērū́keion}}'' "herald's wand, or staff")&lt;ref&gt;The Latin word ''{{lang|la|cādūceus}}'' is an adaptation of the Greek word, itself derived from {{lang|grc|κῆρυξ}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|kêrux}}'' "messenger, herald, envoy". Liddell and Scott, ''Greek-English Lexicon''; Stuart L. Tyson, "The Caduceus", ''The Scientific Monthly'', '''34'''.6, (1932:492–98) p. 493.&lt;/ref&gt; is the staff carried by [[Hermes]] in [[Greek mythology]] and consequently by [[Hermes Trismegistus]] in Greco-Egyptian mythology. The same staff was also borne by heralds in general, for example by [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], the messenger of [[Hera]]. It is a short staff entwined by two [[Serpent (mythology)|serpents]], sometimes surmounted by wings.  In Roman iconography, it was often depicted being carried in the left hand of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], the messenger of the gods, guide of the dead, and protector of merchants, shepherds, gamblers, liars, and thieves.&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, Spawforth, ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary'', third ed., Oxford 1996, p. 690 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some accounts suggest that the oldest known imagery of the caduceus have their roots in a Mesopotamian origin with the Sumerian god [[Ningishzida]] whose symbol, a staff with two snakes intertwined around it, dates back to 4000 B.C. to 3000 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman, "The Quest for Hermes Trismigestus", 2011, Chapter 3, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a symbolic object, it represents Hermes (or the Roman Mercury), and by extension trades, occupations, or undertakings associated with the god. In later [[Classical antiquity|Antiquity]], the caduceus provided the basis for the [[Astrological symbols|astrological symbol]] representing the [[Mercury (planet)|planet Mercury]]. Thus, through its use in [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and [[astronomy]] it has come to denote the [[Mercury (planet)|planet]] and [[Mercury (element)|elemental metal]] of the same name. It is said the wand would wake the sleeping and send the awake to sleep. If applied to the dying, their death was gentle; if applied to the dead, they returned to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog|title=Lives of the Necromancers|author=William Godwin|year=1876|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension of its association with Mercury and Hermes, the caduceus is also a recognized symbol of commerce and negotiation, two realms in which balanced exchange and reciprocity are recognized as ideals.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. the Unicode standard, where the "staff of Hermes" signifies "a commercial term or commerce"; see also: Walter J. Friedlander, ''The Golden Wand of Medicine: A History of the Caduceus Symbol in Medicine'', Greenwood, 1992, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As one specialized study of symbolism notes, "In modern times the caduceus figures as a symbol of commerce, since [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] is the god of commerce. M. Oldfield Howey, ''The Encircled Serpent: A Study of Serpent Symbolism in All Countries And Ages'', New York, 1955, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This association is ancient, and consistent from the Classical period to modern times.&lt;ref&gt;"The name of the god Mercury cannot be disassociated from the word ''merx'', which means merchandise. Such was the sentiment of the ancients" Yves Bonnefoy (Ed.), Wendy Doniger (Trans.), ''Roman and European Mythologies'', University of Chicago Press, 1992, p. 135; "Mercury was the Roman name for the Greek god Hermes. His Latin name was apparently derived from merx or mercator, a merchant." Michael E. Bakich, ''The Cambridge Planetary Handbook'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 85; Latin ''merx'' is the root of the English words Commerce, Market, Mart, Mercantile, Mercenary, Mercer, Merchant and Mercury, as can be seen by referring to any dictionary including etymological information.&lt;/ref&gt; The caduceus is also used as a symbol representing printing, again by extension of the attributes of Mercury (in this case associated with writing and eloquence).

The caduceus is often incorrectly used [[Caduceus as a symbol of medicine|as a symbol of healthcare organizations and medical practice]], particularly in [[North America]], due to confusion with the traditional medical symbol, the [[Rod of Asclepius]], which has only one snake and is never depicted with wings.

==Origin and comparative mythology==
{{further information|Serpent worship}}
[[File:Lekythos of Hermes.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hermes hastens bearing his ''kerukeion'', on an [[Attica|Attic]] [[lekythos]], c. 475 BC, attributed to the [[Tithonos Painter]]]]
[[File:Longane, Sicily.JPG|thumb|upright=0.6|Bronze caduceus of a lost civilisation that developed along the ancient [[Longanus]] river in Sicily]]

[[File:Winged goddess Cdm Paris 392.jpg|thumb|Iris with the caduceus in detail from an Attic [[red-figure]] [[pelike]], middle of fifth century BC ([[Agrigento]], Sicily)]]

It is thought that this symbol's long lasting association with the medical profession stems from early use of twigs to draw out long bodied inter muscular parasitic worms by wrapping them slowly around the twig so as not to break them or allow them to escape back into the body, a successful treatment still in use today, see [[Dracunculiasis]].{{Citation needed|reason=This has no citation, and sounds like it might be false or at best the thought of a single researcher|date=March 2018}}

The term ''kerukeion'' denoted any herald's staff, not necessarily associated with Hermes in particular.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', third edition, ed. Hornblower and Spawforth, ''s.v.'' "Hermes".&lt;/ref&gt;

In his study of the cult of Hermes, [[Lewis Richard Farnell]] (1909) assumed that the two snakes had simply developed out of ornaments of the shepherd's crook used by heralds as their staff.&lt;ref&gt;Farnell, ''[[The Cults of the Greek States]]'', vol. 5, p. 20, cited in Tyson 1932:494.&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been rejected by later authors pointing to parallel iconography in the Ancient Near East. It has been argued that the staff or wand entwined by two snakes was itself representing a god in the pre-anthropomorphic era. Like the [[herma|herm]] or [[priapus]], it would thus be a predecessor of the anthropomorphic Hermes of the classical era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. L. Frothingham|title=Babylonian Origin of Hermes the Snake-God, and of the Caduceus I|work=American Journal of Archaeology|volume= 20, No. 2 (April–June, 1916)|pages= 175–211| jstor=497115}} Frothingham characterizes Farnell's simplistic view of the origin of the symbol as a "frivolous and futile theory".&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
The serpent-staff is in origin a symbolic depiction of the [[world pillar]] and the [[world serpent]].
The addition of a second serpent in the staff of Hermes is usually connected to an element of [[hermaphroditism]].
--&gt;

===Ancient Near East===
[[File:Caduceus on Mauryan coin.jpg|thumb|Caduceus symbol on a [[punch-marked coin]] of king [[Ashoka]] in [[India]], third to second century BC]]

[[William Hayes Ward]] (1910) discovered that symbols similar to the classical caduceus sometimes appeared on [[Mesopotamian cylinder seals]]. He suggested the symbol originated some time between 3000 and 4000 BC, and that it might have been the source of the Greek caduceus.&lt;ref&gt;William Hayes Ward, ''The Seal Cylinders of Western Asia'', Washington, 1910&lt;/ref&gt; A.L. Frothingham incorporated Dr. Ward's research into his own work, published in 1916, in which he suggested that the prototype of Hermes was an "Oriental deity of Babylonian extraction" represented in his earliest form as a snake god. From this perspective, the caduceus was originally representative of Hermes himself, in his early form as the Underworld god [[Ningishzida]], "messenger" of the "Earth Mother".&lt;ref&gt;A.L. Frothingham, "Babylonian Origins of Hermes the Snake-God, and of the Caduceus", in ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 20, No. 2, pp. 175–211&lt;/ref&gt;
The caduceus is mentioned in passing by [[Walter Burkert]]&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, ''Greek Religion'' 1985: II.2.8, p. 158; Burkert notes H. Frankfort, in ''Iraq'', '''1''' (1934:10) and E.D. van Buren, in ''Archiv für Orientforschung'', '''10''' (1935/36:53-65).&lt;/ref&gt; as "really the image of copulating snakes taken over from Ancient Near Eastern tradition".

In Egyptian iconography, the [[Djed]] pillar is depicted as containing a snake in a frieze of the [[Dendera Temple complex]].

===India===
The caduceus also appears as a symbol of the [[punch-marked coins]] of the [[Maurya Empire]] in India, in the third or second century BC. Numismatic research suggest that this symbol was the symbol of the Buddhist king [[Ashoka]], his personal "[[Mudra]]".&lt;ref&gt;Damodar Dharmanand Kosambi, ''Indian Numismatics'', Orient Longman, New Delhi 1981, p. 73 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=favxZII9WtwC&amp;pg=PA73 online]).&lt;/ref&gt; This symbol was not used on the pre-Mauryan punch-marked coins, but only on coins of the Maurya period, together with the [[arched-hill symbol|three arched-hill symbol]], the "peacock on the hill", the [[triskelis]] and the [[Taxila]] mark.&lt;ref&gt;Kailash Chand Jain, ''Malwa Through the Ages. From the Earliest Time to 1305 A.D.'', Motilal Banarsidass, Delhi et al. 1972, p. 134 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=_3O7q7cU7k0C&amp;pg=PA134 online]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical antiquity==
===Mythology===
[[File:Pompeii - Casa dei Vettii - Ixion.jpg|thumb|Punishment of [[Ixion]]: in the center is [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] holding the caduceus and on the right [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] sits on her throne. Behind her [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]] stands and gestures. On the left is [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] ([[blond]] figure) standing behind the wheel, manning it, with Ixion already tied to it. [[Nephele]] sits at Mercury's feet; a Roman fresco from the eastern wall of the [[triclinium]] in the [[House of the Vettii]], [[Pompeii]], [[Pompeian Styles|Fourth Style]] (60–79 AD).]]

The [[Homeric hymn]] to Hermes relates how Hermes offered his lyre fashioned from a tortoise shell as compensation for the [[cattle raid|cattle he stole]] from his half brother [[Apollo]]. Apollo in return gave Hermes the caduceus as a gesture of friendship.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson 1932:494.&lt;/ref&gt;
The association with the serpent thus connects Hermes to [[Apollo]], as later the serpent was associated with [[Asclepius]], the "son of Apollo".&lt;ref&gt;Deldon Anne McNeely ''Mercury rising: women, evil, and the trickster gods'', Spring Publications, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-88214-366-8}}, p. 90.
"Homer tell us that Hermes' caduceus, the golden wand, was acquired by Hermes from Apollo in exchange for the tortoise-lyre; later the caduceus changed hands again from Hermes to Apollo's son, Asclepius."&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of Apollo with the serpent is a continuation of the older [[Indo-European mythology|Indo-European]] [[dragon]]-slayer motif. [[Wilhelm Heinrich Roscher]] (1913) pointed out that the serpent as an attribute of both Hermes and Asclepius is a variant of the "pre-historic semi-chthonic serpent hero known at Delphi as [[Python (mythology)|Python]]", who in classical mythology is slain by Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=S. Davis (citing W. H. Roscher, ''Omphalos'' (1913))|title=Argeiphontes in Homer – The Dragon-Slayer, ''Greece &amp; Rome'' Vol. 22, No. 64 (Feb., 1953), pp. 33–38|jstor= 640827}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Greek [[Etiology|myth of origin]] of the caduceus is part of the story of [[Tiresias]],&lt;ref name=blayney&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drblayney.com/Asclepius.html|title=The Caduceus vs the Staff of Asclepius|last=Blayney|first=Keith|date=September 2002|accessdate=2007-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; who found two snakes copulating and killed the female with his staff.  Tiresias was immediately turned into a woman, and so remained until he was able to repeat the act with the male snake seven years later.  This staff later came into the possession of the god Hermes, along with its transformative powers.

Another myth suggests that Hermes (or Mercury) saw two serpents entwined in mortal combat. Separating them with his wand he brought about peace between them, and as a result the wand with two serpents came to be seen as a sign of peace.&lt;ref&gt;Tyson 1932:495&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, [[Livy]] refers to the ''caduceator'' who negotiated peace arrangements under the diplomatic protection of the caduceus he carried.&lt;ref&gt;Livy: [[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]], 31,38,9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iconography===
In some vase paintings ancient depictions of the Greek ''kerukeion'' are somewhat different from the commonly seen modern representation. These representations feature the two snakes atop the staff (or rod), crossed to create a circle with the heads of the snakes resembling horns. This old graphic form, with an additional crossbar to the staff, seems to have provided the basis for the graphical [[sign of Mercury]] (☿) used in  [[Greek astrology]] from Late Antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;"Signs and Symbols Used In Writing and Printing", p 269, in ''Webster's New Twentieth Century Dictionary of the English Language'', unabridged, New York, 1953. Here the symbol of the planet Mercury is indicated as "the caduceus of Mercury, or his head and winged cap".&lt;/ref&gt;

Caduceus is encoded in [[Unicode]] at code point U+2624: ☤.

===Symbol of commerce===
A simplified variant of the caduceus is to be found in dictionaries, indicating a “commercial term” entirely in keeping with the association of Hermes with commerce. In this form the staff is often depicted with two winglets attached and the snakes are omitted (or reduced to a small ring in the middle).&lt;ref&gt;For example, see the Unicode standard, where the "staff of Hermes" signifies "a commercial term or commerce".&lt;/ref&gt; The Customs Service  of the former [[German Democratic Republic]]  employed the caduceus, bringing its implied associations with thresholds, translators, and commerce, in the service medals they issued their staff. The caduceus is also the symbol of the Customs Agency of Bulgaria. The emblem of the China Customs is a caduceus crossing with a golden key.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zhengzhou.customs.gov.cn/publish/portal106/tab1641/module5966/info3560.htm 海关关徽].&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics, a '''condensation point''' ''p'' of a subset ''S'' of a [[topological space]], is any point ''p'', such that every [[open neighborhood]] of ''p'' contains [[uncountably many]] points of ''S''. Thus, "condensation point" is synonymous with "&lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;-[[accumulation point]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Condensation_point_of_a_set&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
*If ''S'' = (0,1) is the open unit interval, a subset of the [[real numbers]], then 0 is a condensation point of ''S''.
*If ''S'' is an uncountable subset of a set ''X'' endowed with the [[indiscrete topology]], then any point ''p'' of ''X'' is a condensation point of ''X'' as the only open neighborhood of ''p'' is ''X'' itself.

[[File:Ferro antiferro spatial corrs png.png|thumb|right|Schematic equal-time spin correlation functions for ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials both above and below &lt;math&gt;T_\text{Curie}&lt;/math&gt; versus the distance normalized by the correlation length, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;. In all cases, correlations are strongest nearest to the origin, indicating that a spin has the strongest influence on its nearest neighbors. All correlations gradually decay as the distance from the spin at the origin increases. Above the Curie temperature, the correlation between spins tends to zero as the distance between the spins gets very large. In contrast, below &lt;math&gt;T_\text{Curie}&lt;/math&gt;, the correlation between the spins does not tend toward zero at large distances, but instead decays to a level consistent with the long-range order of the system. The difference in these decay behaviors, where correlations between microscopic random variables become zero versus non-zero at large distances, is one way of defining short- versus long-range order.]]

In [[statistical mechanics]], the '''correlation function''' is a measure of the order in a system, as characterized by a mathematical [[correlation function]]. Correlation functions describe how microscopic variables, such as spin and density, at different positions are related. More specifically, correlation functions quantify how microscopic variables co-vary with one another on average across space and time. A classic example of such spatial correlations is in ferro- and antiferromagnetic materials, where the spins prefer to align parallel and antiparallel with their nearest neighbors, respectively. The spatial correlation between spins in such materials is shown in the figure to the right.

==Definitions==
The most common definition of a correlation function is  the [[canonical ensemble]] (thermal) average of the scalar product of two random variables, &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt;, at positions &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R+r&lt;/math&gt; and times &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t+\tau&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;C (r,\tau) = \langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \cdot \mathbf{s_2}(R+r,t+\tau)\rangle\ - \langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \rangle\langle \mathbf{s_2}(R+r,t+\tau) \rangle\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Here the brackets, &lt;math&gt;\langle ...  \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, indicate the above-mentioned thermal average. It is a matter of convention whether one subtracts the uncorrelated average product of &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \rangle\langle \mathbf{s_2}(R+r,t+\tau) \rangle &lt;/math&gt; from the correlated product, &lt;math&gt;\langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \cdot \mathbf{s_2}(R+r,t+\tau)\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, with the convention differing among fields. The most common uses of correlation functions are when &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; describe the same variable, such as a spin-spin correlation function, or a particle position-position correlation function in an elemental liquid or a solid (often called a [[Radial distribution function]] or a pair correlation function). Correlation functions between the same random variable are [[autocorrelation function]]s. However, in statistical mechanics, not all correlation functions are autocorrelation functions. For example, in multicomponent condensed phases, the pair correlation function between different elements is often of interest. Such mixed-element pair correlation functions are an example of [[Cross-correlation|cross-correlation functions]], as the random variables &lt;math&gt;s_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s_2&lt;/math&gt; represent the average variations in density as a function position for two distinct elements.

===Equilibrium equal-time (spatial) correlation functions===
Often, one is interested in solely the ''spatial'' influence of a given random variable, say the direction of a spin, on its local environment, without considering later times, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, we neglect the time evolution of the system, so the above definition is re-written with &lt;math&gt;\tau = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This defines the '''equal-time correlation function''', &lt;math&gt;C(r,0)&lt;/math&gt;. It is written as:

&lt;math&gt;C (r,0) = \langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \cdot \mathbf{s_2}(R+r,t)\rangle\ - \langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \rangle\langle \mathbf{s_2}(R+r,t) \rangle\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Often, one omits the reference time, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, and reference radius, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, by assuming equilibrium (and thus time invariance of the ensemble) and averaging over all sample positions, yielding:

&lt;math&gt;C (r) = \langle \mathbf{s_1}(0) \cdot \mathbf{s_2}(r)\rangle\ - \langle \mathbf{s_1}(0) \rangle\langle \mathbf{s_2}(r) \rangle\,.&lt;/math&gt;

where, again, the choice of whether to subtract the uncorrelated variables differs among fields. The [[Radial distribution function]] is an example of an equal-time correlation function where the uncorrelated reference is generally not subtracted. Other equal-time spin-spin correlation functions are shown on this page for a variety of materials and conditions.

===Equilibrium equal-position (temporal) correlation functions===
One might also be interested in the ''temporal'' evolution of microscopic variables. In other words, how the value of a microscopic variable at a given position and time, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, influences the value of the same microscopic variable at a later time, &lt;math&gt;t+\tau&lt;/math&gt; (and usually at the same position). Such temporal correlations are quantified via '''equal-position correlation functions''', &lt;math&gt;C (0,\tau)&lt;/math&gt;. They are defined analogously to above equal-time correlation functions, but we now neglect spatial dependencies by setting &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;, yielding:

&lt;math&gt;C (0,\tau) = \langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \cdot \mathbf{s_2}(R,t+\tau)\rangle\ - \langle \mathbf{s_1}(R,t) \rangle\langle \mathbf{s_2}(R,t+\tau) \rangle\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming equilibrium (and thus time invariance of the ensemble) and averaging over all sites in the sample gives a simpler expression for the equal-position correlation function as for the equal-time correlation function:

&lt;math&gt;C (\tau) = \langle \mathbf{s_1}(0) \cdot \mathbf{s_2}(\tau)\rangle\ - \langle \mathbf{s_1}(0) \rangle\langle \mathbf{s_2}(\tau) \rangle\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The above assumption may seem non-intuitive at first: how can an ensemble which is time-invariant have a non-uniform temporal correlation function? Temporal correlations remain relevant to talk about in equilibrium systems because a time-invariant, ''macroscopic'' ensemble can still have non-trivial temporal dynamics ''microscopically''. One example is in diffusion. A single-phase system at equilibrium has a homogeneous composition macroscopically. However, if one watches the microscopic movement of each atom, fluctuations in composition are constantly occurring due to the quasi-random walks taken by the individual atoms. Statistical mechanics allows one to make insightful statements about the temporal behavior of such fluctuations of equilibrium systems. This is discussed below in the section on the [[#Time evolution of correlation functions|temporal evolution of correlation functions and  Onsager's regression hypothesis]].

===Generalization beyond equilibrium correlation functions===
All of the above correlation functions have been defined in the context of equilibrium statistical mechanics. However, it is possible to define correlation functions for systems away from equilibrium. Examining the general definition of &lt;math&gt;C(r,\tau)&lt;/math&gt;, it is clear that one can define the random variables used in these correlation functions, such as atomic positions and spins, away from equilibrium. As such, their scalar product is well-defined away from equilibrium. The operation which is no longer well-defined away from equilibrium is the average over the equilibrium ensemble. This averaging process for non-equilibrium system is typically replaced by averaging the scalar product across the entire sample. This is typical in scattering experiments and computer simulations, and is often used to measure the radial distribution functions of glasses.

One can also define averages over states for systems perturbed slightly from equilibrium. See, for example, http://xbeams.chem.yale.edu/~batista/vaa/node56.html

==Measuring correlation functions==
Correlation functions are typically measured with scattering experiments. For example, x-ray scattering experiments directly measure electron-electron equal-time correlations.&lt;ref name=Sethna&gt;{{cite book |first=James P. |last= Sethna |title=Statistical Mechanics: Entropy, Order Parameters, and Complexity |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0198566778 |chapter= Chapter 10: Correlations, response, and dissipation|url= http://pages.physics.cornell.edu/~sethna/StatMech/}}&lt;/ref&gt; From knowledge of elemental structure factors, one can also measure elemental pair correlation functions. See [[Radial distribution function]] for further information. Equal-time spin–spin correlation functions are measured with [[neutron scattering]] as opposed to x-ray scattering. Neutron scattering can also yield information on pair correlations as well. For systems composed of particles larger than about one micrometer, optical microscopy can be used to measure both equal-time and equal-position correlation functions. Optical microscopy is thus common for colloidal suspensions, especially in two dimensions.

==Time evolution of correlation functions==
In 1931, [[Lars Onsager]] proposed that the regression of microscopic thermal fluctuations at equilibrium follows the macroscopic law of relaxation of small non-equilibrium disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the ''[[Onsager Regression Hypothesis|Onsager regression hypothesis]]''. As the values of microscopic variables separated by large timescales, &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, should be uncorrelated beyond what we would expect from thermodynamic equilibrium, the evolution in time of a correlation function can be viewed from a physical standpoint as the system gradually 'forgetting' the initial conditions placed upon it via the specification of some microscopic variable. There is actually an intuitive connection between the time evolution of correlation functions and the time evolution of macroscopic systems: on average, the correlation function evolves in time in the same manner as if a system was prepared in the conditions specified by the correlation function's initial value and allowed to evolve.&lt;ref name=Sethna/&gt;

==The connection between phase transitions and correlation functions==
[[File:Ferromagnetic correlation functions around Tc.svg|thumb|left|alt=The caption is very descriptive.|Equal-time correlation functions, &lt;math&gt;C(r,\tau =0)&lt;/math&gt;, as a function of radius for a ferromagnetic spin system above, at, and below at its critical temperature, &lt;math&gt;T_ C&lt;/math&gt;. Above &lt;math&gt;T_ C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;C(r,\tau =0)&lt;/math&gt; exhibits a combined exponential and power-law dependence on distance: &lt;math&gt;C (r,\tau = 0)\propto r^{-(d-2+\eta )} e^{-r/\xi (T)} &lt;/math&gt;. The power-law dependence dominates at distances short relative to the correlation length, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, while the exponential dependence dominates at distances large relative to &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;. At &lt;math&gt;T_ C&lt;/math&gt;, the correlation length diverges, &lt;math&gt;\xi (T_C)=\infty&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in solely power-law behavior: &lt;math&gt;C(r,\tau =0) \propto r^{-(d-2+\eta)}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;T_ C&lt;/math&gt; is distinguished by the extreme non-locality of the spatial correlations between microscopic values of the relevant order parameter without long-range order. Below &lt;math&gt;T_ C&lt;/math&gt;, the spins exhibit spontaneous ordering but finite correlation length again. Continuous order-disorder transitions can be understood as the process of the correlation length, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, transitioning from being finite in the low-temperature, ordered state, to infinite at the critical point, and then again finite in a high-temperature, disordered state.]]
Continuous phase transitions, such as order-disorder transitions in metallic alloys and ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transitions, involve a transition from an ordered to a disordered state. In terms of correlation functions, the equal-time correlation function is non-zero for all lattice points below the critical temperature, and is non-negligible for only a fairly small radius above the critical temperature. As the phase transition is continuous, the length over which the microscopic variables are correlated, &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, must transition continuously from being infinite to finite when the material is heated through its critical temperature. This gives rise to a power-law dependence of the correlation function as a function of distance at the critical point. This is shown in the figure in the left for the case of a ferromagnetic material, with the quantitative details listed in the section on magnetism.

==Applications==
===Magnetism===

In a [[spin (physics)|spin]] system, the equal-time correlation function is especially well-studied. It describes the canonical ensemble (thermal) average of the scalar product of the spins at two lattice points over all possible orderings:
&lt;math&gt;G (r) = \langle \mathbf{s}(R) \cdot \mathbf{s}(R+r)\rangle\ - \langle \mathbf{s}(R) \rangle\langle \mathbf{s}(R+r) \rangle\,.&lt;/math&gt;
Here the brackets mean the above-mentioned thermal average. Schematic plots of this function are shown for a ferromagnetic material below, at, and above its Curie temperature on the left.

Even in a magnetically disordered phase, spins at different positions are correlated, i.e., if the distance r is very small (compared to some length scale &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;), the interaction between the spins will cause them to be correlated.
The alignment that would naturally arise as a result of the interaction between spins is destroyed by thermal effects. At high temperatures exponentially-decaying correlations are observed with increasing distance, with the correlation function being given asymptotically by
:&lt;math&gt;G (r) \approx \frac{1}{r^{d-2+\eta}}\exp{\left(\frac{-r}{\xi}\right)}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where r is the distance between spins, and d is the dimension of the system, and &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is a [[critical exponent]]. At high temperatures, the correlation decays to zero exponentially with the distance between the spins. The same exponential decay as a function of radial distance is also observed below &lt;math&gt;T_c&lt;/math&gt;, but with the limit at large distances being the mean magnetization &lt;math&gt;\langle M^2 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

As the temperature is lowered, thermal disordering is lowered, and in a continuous phase transition the correlation length diverges, as the correlation length must transition continuously from a finite value above the phase transition, to infinite below the phase transition:

:&lt;math&gt;\xi\propto |T-T_c|^{-\nu}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

with another critical exponent &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt;.

This [[power law]] correlation is responsible for the [[scaling invariance|scaling]], seen in these transitions. All  exponents mentioned are independent of temperature.
They are in fact [[universality (dynamical systems)|universal]], i.e. found to be the same in a wide variety of systems.

===Radial distribution functions===
One common correlation function is the [[radial distribution function]] which is seen often in [[statistical mechanics]]. The correlation function can be calculated in exactly solvable models (one-dimensional Bose gas, spin chains, Hubbard model) by means of [[Quantum inverse scattering method]] and [[Bethe ansatz]]. In an isotropic XY model, time and temperature correlations were evaluated by Its, Korepin, Izergin &amp; Slavnov.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Its, V.e. Korepin, A.G. Izergin &amp; N.A. Slavnov (2009) [https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.4751 Temperature Correlation of Quantum Spins] from [[arxiv.org]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Higher order correlation functions====
Higher-order correlation functions involve multiple reference points, and are defined through a generalization of the above correlation function by taking the expected value of the product of more than two random variables:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{i_1i_2\cdots i_n}(s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_n) = \langle X_{i_1}(s_1) X_{i_2}(s_2) \cdots X_{i_n}(s_n)\rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

However, such higher order correlation functions are relatively difficult to interpret and measure. For example, in order to measure the higher-order analogues of pair distribution functions, coherent x-ray sources are needed.

[[Crime]] and [[violence]] affect the lives of millions of people in Latin America. Some consider social inequality to be a major contributing factor to levels of violence in Latin America,&lt;ref&gt;"World Bank research convincingly demoinequality, which has worsened in Latin America in the past decade and is unlikely to improve dramatically in the years ahead." - Prillaman (2003:1)&lt;/ref&gt; where the state fails to prevent crime and organized crime takes over State control in areas where the State is unable to assist the society such as in impoverished communities. In the years following the transitions from authoritarianism to democracy, crime and violence have become major problems in Latin America.

Several studies indicated the existence of an epidemic in the region; the [[Pan American Health Organization]] called violence in Latin America "the social [[pandemic]] of the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;Cesar Chelala, ''Violence in the Americas: The Social Pandemic of the 20th Century'' (Washington, D.C.: Pan American Health Organization, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the direct human cost, the rise in crime and violence has imposed significant social costs and has made much more difficult the processes of [[economic development|economic]] and [[social development]], [[democratic consolidation]] and regional integration in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://laii.unm.edu/conference/mesquita.php LAII: Crime, Violence and Democracy in Latin America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103102210/http://laii.unm.edu/conference/mesquita.php |date=2007-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LatinAmericaViolence.svg|thumb|400px|right|Numerous factors have caused the immensely high crime rates in Latin America. Two significant factors that have been influencing violence are high poverty rates and consistently high amounts of drug trafficking. Data: UNODC, 2012.]]

==Consequences for the region==
High rates of crime and violence in Latin America are undermining growth, threatening human welfare, and impeding social development, according to [[World Bank]] and the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/0,,contentMDK:21320803~pagePK:146736~piPK:226340~theSitePK:258554,00.html Latin America and Caribbean - Crime, Violence, and Development: Trends, Costs, and Policy Options in the Caribbean&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Latin America is caught in a vicious circle, where economic growth is thwarted by high crime rates, and insufficient economic opportunity contributes to high crime.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Crime and violence thrives as the rule of law is weak, economic opportunity is scarce, and education is poor. Therefore, effectively addressing crime requires a holistic, multi-sectoral approach that addresses its root social, political, and economic causes.

Recent statistics indicate that crime is becoming the biggest problem in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.iadb.org/res/consultasanjose/files/summary_sp/violence_summary.pdf|title=Violence and Crime in Latin America|accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amnesty International has declared Latin America as the most dangerous region in the world for journalists to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/05/12/americas.press.freedom/index.html|title=Amnesty International: Latin America 'dangerous' for journalists|accessdate=30 August 2013 | work=CNN|date=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, armed gangs of rival drug smugglers have been fighting it out with one another, thus creating new hazards in rural areas. Crime is extremely high in all of the major cities in [[Brazil]]. Wealthy citizens have had to provide for their own security. In large parts of [[Rio de Janeiro]], armed criminal gangs are said to be in control. Crime statistics were high in [[El Salvador]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Venezuela]] during 1996. The police have not been able to handle the work load and the military have been called in to assist in these countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prezi.com/-ryl7lygh6kh/latin-america-what-i-want-to-change/]&lt;/ref&gt; There was a very distinct crime wave happening in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emergency.com/ltn-scty.htm Security Problems in Latin America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The city that currently topped the list of the world's most violent cities is [[San Pedro Sula]] in [[Honduras]], leading various media sources to label it the "murder capital of the world."&lt;ref name=CNNmurder2013&gt;Rafael Romo and Nick Thompson, [http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/27/world/americas/honduras-murder-capital Inside San Pedro Sula, the 'murder capital' of the world], CNN, March 28, 2013, accessed April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYDNmurder2013&gt;Carol Kuruvilla, [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/honduran-city-murder-capital-world-report-article-1.1303512 San Pedro Sula in northwest Honduras is the murder capital of the world: report], ''New York Daily News'', March 30, 2013, accessed April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reutersmurder2013&gt;Jorge Cabrera, [http://blogs.reuters.com/photographers-blog/2013/04/05/life-and-death-in-the-murder-capital/ Life and death in the murder capital], Reuters, April 5, 2013, accessed April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FOXmurder2013&gt;[http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/news/2013/02/08/honduran-city-is-world-murder-capital-juarez-drops-for-second-year-in-row/ Honduran City is World Murder Capital; Juarez Drops for Second Year in a Row], Fox News Latino, February 8, 2013, accessed April 30, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia registered a homicide rate of 24.4 per 100,000 in 2016, the lowest since 1974.

Massive street marches such as those that took place in [[Argentina]], Mexico, and [[Brazil]], and other expressions of protest against violence, have made it increasingly difficult for politicians to avoid dealing with the issue and, in many countries, have made tackling crime a central theme in political party platforms across the region. Several leaders in the region, including El Salvador's [[Tony Saca]], [[Ricardo Maduro]] in Honduras, Guatemala's [[Óscar Berger]], and [[Álvaro Uribe]] in Colombia, have all campaigned on a strong anti-crime message.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The Presidents of [[Honduras]] and [[El Salvador]] have called gangs ''([[mara (gang)|maras]])'' as big a threat to national security in their countries as terrorism is to the United States.&lt;ref name=CrimeandGangs1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/26/international/americas/26honduras.html?pagewanted=print&amp;position=&amp;_r=0|title=Shuttling Between Nations, Latino Gangs Confound the Law|accessdate=29 August 2013 | work=The New York Times|first=Ginger|last=Thompson|date=26 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"World Bank researchers have demonstrated the existence of a 'criminal inertia,' in which high rates of criminality endure long after the latent socioeconomic causes have disappeared or been addressed through policy interventions."&lt;ref&gt;WC Prillaman (2003), "[http://www.csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/ppcrime_democracy_inlatinamerica%5B1%5D.pdf Crime, democracy, and development in Latin America]," ''Policy Papers on the Americas''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see Daniel Lederman, Norman Loayza, and Ana María Menendez, “Violent Crime: Does Social Capital Matter?” Economic Development and Cultural Change 3 (April 2002): 509–539; Richard Rosenfeld, Steven F.

Another reason critics believe fuels crime in Latin America is due to the poor public primary education system they say it "has given rise to youths without jobs or expectations of employment-thereby fueling the mounting problem of gang violence in Central America, Mexico, Jamaica, Trinidad, Colombia and Brazil." &lt;ref&gt;__."Crime Hinders Development, Democracy in Latin America, U.S. Says".

==Contributing factors==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Rocinha and Sao Conrado.jpg|thumb|340px|[[Rocinha]] [[slum]] contrasting with luxurious condos of [[São Conrado]].]] --&gt;


A series of factors have contributed to the increase in violent crime in Latin America since the transitions from [[authoritarianism]] to [[democracy]]. Some intrinsic factors and characteristics of each country aggravated the problem in some countries. However, some factors might have increased the risk of crime and violence in many or most countries in the region in the period between the 1980s and 1990s:&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

* High levels of [[social inequality]]
* [[Civil wars]] and armed [[War|conflicts]]
* Low rates of economic growth
* High [[unemployment]] rates
* Rapid growth of large cities and metropolitan areas
* Absence/weakness of basic urban infrastructure, basic social services and community organizations in the poorest neighborhoods, in the periphery of large cities and metropolitan areas
* Growing availability of [[Weapons|arms]] and [[drugs]]
* Growing presence and strengthening of [[organized crime]]
* Culture of violence, reinforced by [[organized crime]] as well as the [[Mass media|media]], the [[police]] and the private security services
* Low level of effectiveness of the [[police]] and other institutions in the [[criminal justice]] system
* Poor public education system.

==Nations with high crime rates==

===Brazil===
{{main|Crime in Brazil}}

Brazil is one of the countries that has the largest inequality in terms of the gap between the very wealthy and the extremely destitute. A huge portion of the population lives in poverty. According to the World Bank, "one-fifth of Brazil's 173 million people account for only a 2.2 percent share of the national income. Brazil is second only to South Africa in a world ranking of [[income inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/BRAZILEXTN/0,,menuPK:322351~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:322341,00.html#Challenges Brazil - Country Brief&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence of violent crime, including muggings, armed robbery, murder and sexual assault is high, particularly in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Recife]] and other large cities. [[Carjacking]] is also common, particularly in major cities. Criminals often use guns. Gang-related violence is common throughout the [[State of São Paulo]]. Crime levels in slum areas are very high.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Victims have been seriously injured or killed when resisting perpetrators. During peak tourist seasons, large, organised criminal gangs have reportedly robbed and assaulted beach goers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The country is well known for having almost 60,000 documented murders every year for the past decade, mostly drug and robbery related.

'Express kidnappings', where individuals are abducted and forced to withdraw funds from [[automated teller machine]]s to secure their release, are common in major cities including [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[São Paulo]], [[Brasília]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] and [[Recife]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} People have been robbed and assaulted when using unregistered taxis. Petty crime such as pickpocketing and bag snatching are common. Thieves operate in outdoor markets, in hotels and on public transport. Piracy occurs in the coastal areas of Brazil.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Colombia===
{{main|Crime in Colombia}}
Elements of all the armed groups have been involved in drug-trafficking. In a country where the presence of the state has always been weak, the result has been a grinding war on multiple fronts, with the civilian population caught in the crossfire and often deliberately targeted for "collaborating". Human rights advocates blame [[Right-wing paramilitarism in Colombia|paramilitaries]] for massacres, "disappearances", and cases of torture and forced displacement. Rebel groups such as the [[FARC]] and the [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] are behind assassinations, kidnapping and extortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1738963.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&amp;A: Colombia's civil conflict | date=December 23, 2009 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of drug related violence was halved in the last 10 years, when the country moved from being the most violent country in the world to have a homicide rate that is inferior to the one registered in countries like [[Honduras]], [[Jamaica]], [[El Salvador]], [[Venezuela]], [[Guatemala]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by intentional homicide rate]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration of President [[Álvaro Uribe|Uribe]] has sought to professionalize the [[Military Forces of Colombia|armed forces]] and to engage them more fully in the counterinsurgency war; as a result, the armed groups have suffered a series of setbacks. [[Police of Colombia|Police in Colombia]] say the number of people kidnapped has fallen 92% since 2000. Common criminals are now the perpetrators of the overwhelming majority of kidnappings. By the year 2016, the number of kidnappings in Colombia had declined to 205 and it continues to decline.&lt;ref name = "92%"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-38450688|title= Colombia kidnappings down 92% since 2000, police say|publisher = bbc.com|date = 28 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Military Personnel2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mindefensa.gov.co/irj/go/km/docs/Mindefensa/Documentos/descargas/estudios%20sectoriales/info_estadistica/Logros_Sector_Defensa.pdf|title= Military Personnel – Logros de la Política Integral de Seguridad y Defensa para la Prosperidad|language= Spanish|publisher= mindefensa.gov.co|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150413195638/http://www.mindefensa.gov.co/irj/go/km/docs/Mindefensa/Documentos/descargas/estudios%20sectoriales/info_estadistica/Logros_Sector_Defensa.pdf|archivedate= 2015-04-13|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, and you are much more likely to encounter a Colombian army checkpoint than an illegal guerrilla roadblock.

Colombia registered a homicide rate of 24.4 per 100,000 in 2016, the lowest since 1974.

Violent crime is rampant in El Salvador, in 2015 the homicide rate peaked at 105 homicides per 100,000 residents.  In 2016, the rate decreased by 20%, but El Salvador continues to be one of the world's most dangerous countries. &lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160517233219/http://abcnews.go.com/International/el-salvador-murder-capital-world-gang-violence-life/story?id=39177963 Crime and Violence: Regional Case Studies: El Salvador&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2012, El Salvador has seen a 40% drop in crime due to what the Salvadoran government called a gang truce.

Violent crime including armed robbery, banditry, assault, kidnapping, sexual assault, and carjacking is common, including in the capital, San Salvador. Downtown [[San Salvador]] is dangerous, particularly at night. Public safety is no laughing matter, San Salvador hosts one of the most notorious unified crime family transnational gangs that spread across the Central American heart region, like the [[Mara Salvatrucha]] and the [[18th Street gang]] that arrived during and since the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].

The security situation has taken a downturn in San Salvador; in 2002, there were over 9000 intentional homicides in the city of San Salvador by international global Central American Gangs or Maras. 2005 and 2006 saw a worsening security situation in San Salvador; and corruption, with the trend continuing in 2008. Crimes have increased to 13 daily, with this sharp increase having occurred in the last six years, making the words San Salvador City synonymous with crime. The portrayal of San Salvador was a dark and foreboding metropolis rife and reign with crime, grime, corruption, and a deep-seated sense of urban decay, ultimately a vice city.

After the civil war and left in complete ruins and destruction, people described and called the city "San Salvador La Ciudad Que Se Desmorona", "San Salvador The City That Crumbles". San Salvador is a rampant and recurring corruption within the city's civil authorities and infrastructure. Certain locations disputed by rival gangs especially in poor slums on the outskirts areas of San Salvador City are labeled as [[No man's land]].

High-level corruption in El Salvador is a serious problem. President [[Mauricio Funes]] pledged to investigate and prosecute corrupt senior officials when he took office in June, 2009, but after a political truce with his predecessor, [[Antonio Saca]], who was expelled from the ARENA party amid large-scale corruption allegations, Funes showed an unwillingness to tackle the problem. ARENA alleged that $219 million in government funds under Saca's personal control had disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09SANSALVADOR1103 United States Embassy San Salvador, "ARENA Expels Former President Saca," classified diplomatic cable CONFIDENTIAL, 15 December 2009, WikiLeaks ID #240031].&lt;/ref&gt; Saca's own former political allies in the ARENA party and private sector told the U.S. Embassy in San Salvador of widespread abuse of power for personal financial gain. Such corruption, the U.S. Embassy reported in a cable leaked by [[WikiLeaks]], "went beyond the pale" even by Salvadoran standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09SANSALVADOR947 United States Embassy San Salvador, "Reorganizing ARENA: The Party's Future After Avila's Defeat," classified diplomatic cable SECRET/NOFORN, 6 October 2010, WikiLeaks ID #228629] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603032809/http://cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=09SANSALVADOR947 |date=3 June 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Crisis Group]], the most violent regions outside of the major urban areas in [[Honduras]] exist on the border with [[Guatemala]], and are highly correlated with the many active drug trafficking routes plying the region.&lt;ref&gt;International Crisis Group.

===Mexico===
{{main|Crime in Mexico}}

Crime is among the most urgent concerns facing [[Mexico]], as Mexican [[drug trafficking]] rings play a major role in the flow of [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[marijuana]] transiting between [[Latin America]] and the [[United States]]. Drug trafficking has contributed to [[Political corruption|corruption]], which has had a deleterious effect on Mexico's Federal Representative Republic. Drug trafficking and [[organized crime]] have also been a major source of [[violent crime]] in Mexico.

Mexico has experienced increasingly high [[crime rates]], especially in major urban centers. The country's great economic polarization has stimulated criminal activity in the lower [[socioeconomic]] strata, which include the majority of the country's population. Crime continues at high levels, and is repeatedly marked by violence, especially in the cities of [[Tijuana]] and [[Ciudad Juárez]], and the states of [[Baja California]], [[Durango]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Guerrero]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Michoacán]], [[Tamaulipas]], and [[Nuevo León]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El narco se expande en México |url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=937be705b8bb9a53102ce6df63c36ec1 |accessdate=7 October 2011 |newspaper=New America Media |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125160412/http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=937be705b8bb9a53102ce6df63c36ec1 |archivedate=November 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other metropolitan areas have lower, yet still serious, levels of crime. Low apprehension and conviction rates contribute to the high crime rate.

Before the drug war in Mexico, there were roughly 300 murders in the border city of Ciudad Juarez in 2007. In 2010, state officials reported a peak of 3,622 homicides in the city. With a rate of 272 murders per 100,000 residents, Ciudad Juarez alone had the highest murder rate in the world,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} although the rate has steadily decreased since then to reach only 300 murders in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Termina 2015 con 300 homicidios; disminuye violencia en 23% del 2014|url=http://www.juareznoticias.com/termina-2015-con-300-homicidios-disminuye-violencia-en-23-del-2014/|accessdate=14 January 2015|newspaper=Juarez Noticias|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081305/http://www.juareznoticias.com/termina-2015-con-300-homicidios-disminuye-violencia-en-23-del-2014/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puerto Rico has become a major transshipment point for illegal drugs that are [[Drug smuggling|smuggled]] from source countries like [[Colombia]] and [[Peru]] into the U.S. mainland.  Most of it is transported to and through the island from drug trafficking organizations in the [[Dominican Republic]], Colombia, Florida, and [[criminal organizations]] in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Drug Intelligence Center]]. "Puerto Rico and the [[U.S. Virgin Islands]] Drug Threat Assessment." [[U.S. Department of Justice]]. (2003). print.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most common ways drugs are smuggled into the island is through [[Commercial vessel|commercial]] and [[Watercraft|private maritime vessels]], and [[container terminals]] such as the [[Port of San Juan]].  It is the busiest port in the Caribbean and the second busiest in Latin America.

Because drugs are trafficked directly into the island from other source countries, they are less expensive than in any other place in the United States. Thus, it is cheap and easy for street gangs to buy and deal to the public mostly in, and from, housing projects, leading to turf wars and the second highest homicide rate in the United States. Police undermining in the drug trade and corruption are also common. Between 1993 and 2000, 1,000 police officers in Puerto Rico lost their jobs from the department due to criminal charges and between 2003 and 2007, 75 officers were convicted under [[United States district court|federal court]] for police corruption.&lt;ref name="Miami Herald 2007"&gt;"Police corruption undermines Puerto Rican drug war." Miami Herald [Miami, FL] 18 July 2007. General OneFile. Web. 7 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miami Herald 2007"/&gt; 2011 was marked as the most violent year for Puerto Rico with approximately 1,120 murders recorded, 30.5 homicides per 100,000 residents.

===Venezuela===
{{main|Crime in Venezuela}}

Venezuela is among the most violent places in Latin America. Class tension has long been a part of life in the South American country, where armed robberies, carjackings and kidnappings are frequent. Venezuela was ranked the most insecure nation in the world by ''[[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]'' in 2013 with the United Nations stating that such crime is due to the poor political and economic environment in the country.&lt;ref name=GALLUP2014&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sonnenschein|first1=Jan|title=Latin America Scores Lowest on Security|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/175082/latin-america-scores-lowest-security.aspx|website=Gallup|publisher=Gallup|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ElEspectador&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela es el país más inseguro del mundo, según un estudio|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/elmundo/venezuela-el-pais-mas-inseguro-delmundo-segun-un-estud-articulo-511937|accessdate=22 August 2014|agency=El Espectador|date=21 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the high levels of crime, Venezuelans were forced to change their ways of life due to the large insecurities they continuously experienced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Insecurity has changed the way of life|url=http://eltiempo.com.ve/locales/puertocruz/sociedad/la-inseguridad-ha-cambiado-el-modo-de-vida/136562|accessdate=27 April 2014|newspaper=El Tiempo|date=27 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crime rates are higher in 'barrios' or 'ranchos' (slum areas) after dark. Petty crime such as pick-pocketing is prevalent, particularly on public transport in Caracas. The government in 2009 created a security force, the [[Bolivarian National Police]], which has supposedly lowered crime rates in the areas in which it is so far deployed according to the Venezuelan government, and a new [[Experimental Security University]] was created.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Romero. "Venezuela more deadly than Iraq". ''New York Times''. August 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; However, many statistics have shown an increase of crime even after such measures were taken, with the 2014 murder rate showing an increase to 82 per 100,000, more than quadrupling since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela Ranks World's Second In Homicides: Report|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/venezuela-ranks-worlds-second-homicides-report-n276371|accessdate=3 January 2015|agency=NBC News|date=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21009630 |accessdate=2010-08-18 |title=Crime in Venezuela: Shooting the messenger | publisher=The Economist |date=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The capital Caracas has one of the greatest homicide rates of any large city in the world, with 122 homicides per 100,000 residents.&lt;ref name="United States Department of State"&gt;{{cite web|title=Venezuela Country Specific Information |url=https://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1059.html |publisher=United States Department of State |accessdate=10 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111012601/http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1059.html |archivedate=11 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuela has also ranked high internationally among countries with high kidnapping rates, with consulting firm Control Risk ranking Venezuela 5th in the world for kidnappings in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Molina|first1=Thabata|title=Ubican a Venezuela en el quinto lugar en riesgo de secuestros|url=http://www.eluniversal.com/sucesos/131214/ubican-a-venezuela-en-el-quinto-lugar-en-riesgo-de-secuestros|accessdate=10 August 2014|agency=El Universal|date=14 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[News.com.au]] calling Venezuela's capital city of Caracas "the kidnap capital of the world" in 2013, noting that Venezuela had the highest kidnapping rate in the world and that 5 people were kidnapped for a [[ransom]] every day.&lt;ref name=NAnov2013&gt;{{cite news|title=Welcome to Venezuela, the kidnap capital of the world|url=http://www.news.com.au/world/south-america/welcome-to-venezuela-the-kidnap-capital-of-the-world/story-fnh81jzo-1226758654049|accessdate=11 December 2014|agency=[[News.com.au]]|date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign governments have also advised tourists of safety concerns while visiting the country. The [[United States State Department]] and [[Government of Canada]] has warned foreign visitors that they may be subjected to [[robbery]], [[kidnapping]] for a [[ransom]] or sale to terrorist organizations and [[murder]], and that their own diplomatic travelers are required to travel in [[Armored car (VIP)|armored vehicles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Venezuela Travel Warning|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/venezuela-travel-warning.html|publisher=United States Department of State|accessdate=9 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130073159/http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/venezuela-travel-warning.html|archive-date=30 January 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Venezuela|url=http://travel.gc.ca/destinations/venezuela|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] has advised against all travel to Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FCO travel advice mapped: the world according to Britain's diplomats|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/mar/23/fco-travel-advice-map|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}

'''Degrowth''' (&lt;!--originally a French term--&gt;{{lang-fr|décroissance}}) is a political, economic, and social movement based on [[ecological economics]], [[Anti-consumerism|anti-consumerist]] and [[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] ideas.&lt;ref name=gd01/&gt;  It is also considered an essential economic strategy responding to the [[The Limits to Growth|limits-to-growth]] dilemma (see ''[[The Path to Degrowth in Overdeveloped Countries]]'' and [[post-growth]]). Degrowth thinkers and activists advocate for the downscaling of [[Production (economics)|production]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]—the contraction of [[Economy|economies]]—arguing that [[overconsumption]] lies at the root of long term [[environmental issue]]s and [[Social inequality|social inequalities]]. Key to the concept of degrowth is that reducing consumption does not require individual [[Martyr|martyring]] or a decrease in [[well-being]].&lt;ref name="Zehner 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=U. Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln &amp; London|isbn=0803237758|pages=178–183, 339–342|url=http://GreenIllusions.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, "degrowthers" aim to maximize happiness and well-being through non-consumptive means—sharing work, consuming less, while devoting more time to art, music, family, nature, culture and community.

==Background==
The movement arose from concerns over the perceived
consequences of the [[productivism]] and [[consumerism]]
associated with industrial societies (whether
[[Capitalism|capitalist]] or [[Socialism|socialist]]) including:&lt;ref name=fd01/&gt;
* The reduced availability of energy sources (see [[peak oil]])
* The declining quality of the environment (see [[global warming]], [[pollution]], [[Biodiversity#Threats|threats to biodiversity]])
* The decline in the health of flora and fauna upon which humans depend (see [[Holocene extinction]])
* The rise of negative societal side-effects (see un[[sustainable development]], poorer [[health]], [[poverty]])
* The ever-expanding use of resources by [[First World]] countries to satisfy lifestyles that consume more food and energy, and produce greater waste, at the expense of the [[Third World]] (see [[neocolonialism]])

===Resource depletion===
{{Main article|Resource depletion}}
As economies grow, the need for resources grows accordingly (unless there are changes in efficiency or demand for different products due to price changes). There is a fixed supply of non-renewable resources, such as [[petroleum]] (oil), and these resources will inevitably be depleted. Renewable resources can also be depleted if extracted at unsustainable rates over extended periods. For example, this has occurred with [[caviar]] production in the Caspian Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Bardi, U. (2008) 'Peak Caviar'. The Oil Drum: Europe. http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/4367&lt;/ref&gt; There is much concern as to how growing demand for these resources will be met as supplies decrease. Many organizations and governments look to energy technologies such as biofuels, solar cells, and wind turbines to meet the demand gap after peak oil. Others have argued that none of the alternatives could effectively replace versatility and portability of oil.&lt;ref&gt;McGreal, R. 2005. 'Bridging the Gap: Alternatives to Petroleum (Peak Oil Part II)'. Raising the Hammer. http://www.raisethehammer.org/index.asp?id=119&lt;/ref&gt; Authors of the book ''Techno-Fix'' criticize technological optimists for overlooking the limitations of technology in solving agricultural and social challenges arising from growth.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org  ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of degrowth argue that decreasing demand is the only way of permanently closing the demand gap. For renewable resources, demand, and therefore production, must also be brought down to levels that prevent depletion and are environmentally healthy. Moving toward a society that is not dependent on oil is seen as essential to avoiding [[societal collapse]] when non-renewable resources are depleted.&lt;ref&gt;Resilience.org. (October 20, 2009). Peak Oil Reports. http://www.resilience.org/stories/2009-10-20/peak-oil-reports-oct-20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological footprint===
{{Main article|Ecological footprint}}

The ecological footprint is a measure of human demand on the Earth's ecosystems. It compares human demand with planet Earth's ecological capacity to regenerate. It represents the amount of biologically productive land and sea area needed to regenerate the resources a human 
population consumes and to absorb and render harmless the corresponding [[waste]].
According to a 2005 [[Global Footprint Network]] report,&lt;ref name=footprintnetwork&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|title=Data Sources|work=footprintnetwork.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001074513/http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/GFN/page/data_sources/|archivedate=2009-10-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; inhabitants of high-income countries live off of 6.4 [[global hectare]]s (gHa), while those from low-income countries live off of a single gHa. For example, while each inhabitant of 
[[Bangladesh]] lives off of what they produce from 0.56 gHa, a [[North America]]n requires 12.5 gHa. Each inhabitant of North America uses 22.3 times as much land as a Bangladeshi. According to the same report, the average number of global hectares per person was 2.1, 
while current consumption levels have reached 2.7 hectares per person. In order for the world's population to attain the living standards typical of European countries, the resources of between three and eight planet [[Earth]]s would be required with current levels of efficiency and means of production. In order for world [[economic equality]] to be achieved with the current available resources, proponents say rich countries would have to reduce their [[standard of living]] through degrowth. The constraints on resources would eventually lead to a forced reduction in consumption. Controlled reduction of consumption would 
reduce the trauma of this change assuming no [[technological change]]s increase the planet's [[carrying capacity]].

=== Degrowth and sustainable development&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Farewell to Growth|last=Latouche|first=Serge|publisher=Polity Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-7456-4616-9|location=Cambridge|pages=9-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Degrowth thought is in opposition to all forms of [[productivism]] (the belief that economic productivity and growth is the purpose of human organization).  It is, thus, opposed to the current form of [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://degrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lorek-_Fuchs-2013.pdf|title=Strong sustainable consumption governance - precondition for a degrowth path?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the concern for 
[[sustainability]] does not contradict degrowth, sustainable development is rooted in mainstream [[international development|development]] ideas that aim to increase capitalist growth and consumption. Degrowth therefore sees sustainable development as an [[oxymoron]],&lt;ref name=Latouche/&gt; as any development based on growth in a finite and environmentally stressed world is seen as inherently unsustainable. 
Critics of degrowth argue that a slowing of [[economic growth]] would result in increased [[unemployment]], increase [[poverty]] and decrease income per capita. Many who understand the devastating environmental consequences of growth still advocate for economic growth in the South, even if not in the North. But, a slowing of economic growth would fail to deliver the benefits of degrowth—self-sufficiency, material responsibility—and would indeed lead to decreased 
employment. Rather, degrowth proponents advocate for a complete abandonment of the current (growth) economic system, suggesting that relocalizing and abandoning the global economy in the [[Global South]] would allow people of the South to become more self-sufficient and would end the overconsumption and exploitation of Southern resources by the North.&lt;ref name=Latouche&gt;Latouche, S. (2004).&gt;[https://mondediplo.com/2004/11/14latouche Degrowth Economics: Why less should be so much more.] ''Le Monde 
Diplomatique''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="The rebound effect"===
{{Main article|Rebound effect (conservation)}}
Technologies designed to reduce resource use and improve efficiency are often touted as sustainable or green solutions. Degrowth literature, however, warns about these technological advances due to the "[[Rebound effect (conservation)|rebound effect]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zehner|first=Ozzie|title=Green Illusions|year=2012|publisher=U. Neb. Pr.|location=Lincoln|pages=172–73, 333–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This concept is based on observations that when a less resource-exhaustive technology is introduced, [[Jevons paradox|behaviour surrounding the use of that technology may change]], and consumption of that technology could increase or even offset any potential resource savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Binswanger |first=M. |year=2001 |title=Technological Progress and Sustainable Development: What About the Rebound Effect? |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=119–32 |doi=10.1016/S0921-8009(00)00214-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the rebound effect, proponents of degrowth hold that the only effective 'sustainable' solutions must involve a complete rejection of the growth paradigm and a move toward a degrowth paradigm. There are also fundamental limits to technological solutions in the pursuit of degrowth, as all engagements with technology increase the cumulutive matter-energy throughput.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heikkurinen|first=Pasi|title=Degrowth by means of technology? A treatise for an ethos of releasement|url= |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.07.070}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the convergence of [[digital commons]] of knowledge and design with [[distributed manufacturing]] technologies may arguably hold potential for building degrowth future scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kostakis |first1=Vasilis |last2=Latoufis |first2=Kostas |last3=Liarokapis |first3=Minas |last4=Bauwens |first4=Michel |title=The convergence of digital commons with local manufacturing from a degrowth perspective: Two illustrative cases|url= |journal=Journal of Cleaner Production|doi=10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the movement==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}
The contemporary degrowth movement can trace its roots back to the anti-industrialist trends of the 19th century, developed in Great Britain by [[John Ruskin]], [[William Morris]] and the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] (1819–1900), in the United States by [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862), and in Russia by [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1828–1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of "degrowth" proper appeared during the 1970s, proposed by [[André Gorz]] (1972) and intellectuals such as [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Edward Goldsmith]] and [[Ivan Illich]], whose ideas reflect those of earlier thinkers, such as the economist [[E. J. Mishan]],&lt;ref&gt;Mishan, Ezra J., ''The Costs of Economic Growth'', Staples Press, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; the industrial historian [[L. T. C. Rolt|Tom Rolt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rolt|first=L. T. C.|title=High Horse Riderless|year=1947|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin|page=171|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/HIGH-HORSE-RIDERLESS-L-T-C-Rolt/dp/B0006ARC3W/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the radical socialist [[Turner Controversy|Tony Turner]]. The writings of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and [[J. C. Kumarappa]] also contain similar philosophies, particularly regarding his support of [[Simple living|voluntary simplicity]].

More generally, degrowth movements draw on the values of [[humanism]], [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]], [[anthropology]] and [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;D’Alisa, G., Demaria, F., Cattaneo, C. (2013). Civil and Uncivil Actors for a Degrowth Society. Journal of Civil Society 9 (2): 212-224.

=== Club of Rome reports ===
In 1968, the [[Club of Rome]], a [[think tank]] headquartered in [[Winterthur]], [[Switzerland]], asked researchers at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] for a report on practical solutions to problems of global concern. The report, called ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'', published in 1972, became the first important study that indicated the ecological perils of the unprecedented economic growth the world was experiencing at the time.

The reports (also known as the Meadows Reports) are not strictly the founding texts of the degrowth movement, as these reports only advise [[Steady-state economy|zero growth]], and have also been used to support the [[sustainable development]] movement. Still, they are considered the first official studies explicitly presenting economic growth as a key reason for the increase in global [[environmental issue|environmental problems]] such as pollution, shortage of raw materials, and the destruction of [[ecosystem]]s. A second report was published in 1974, and together with the first, drew considerable attention to the topic.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Lasting influence of Georgescu-Roegen ===
{{Main article|Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen}}
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Declining-state economy }}

The degrowth movement recognises [[Romanian Americans|Romanian American]] [[mathematician]], [[statistician]] and [[economist]] [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] as the main intellectual figure inspiring the movement.&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|13–16}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548f}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|1742}} &lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|xi}} &lt;ref name=gd01/&gt;{{rp|1f}} In his magnum opus on [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|''The Entropy Law and the Economic Process'']], Georgescu-Roegen argues that economic scarcity is rooted in physical reality; that all [[natural resource]]s are irreversibly degraded when put to use in economic activity; that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of Earth—that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels—is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an inevitable future collapse.&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt;

Georgescu-Roegen's intellectual inspiration to degrowth goes back to the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Levallois2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levallois|first1=Clément|title=Can de-growth be considered a policy option? A historical note on Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and the Club of Rome|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=69|issue=11|year=2010|pages=2271–2278|issn=09218009|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2010.06.020}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Georgescu-Roegen delivered a lecture at the [[University of Geneva]] in 1974, he made a lasting impression on the young and newly graduated French historian and philosopher {{ill|Jacques Grinevald|fr}}, who had earlier been introduced to [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|Georgescu-Roegen's magnum opus]] by an academic advisor. Georgescu-Roegen and Grinevald soon made friends, and Grinevald started devoting his research to a closer study of Georgescu-Roegen's work. As a result, in 1979 Grinevald published a French translation of a selection of Georgescu-Roegen's articles entitled ''Demain la décroissance: Entropie – Écologie – Économie'' ('Tomorrow, the Decline: Entropy – Ecology – Economy').&lt;ref name=ngr03/&gt; Georgescu-Roegen, who spoke French fluently, personally approved the use of the term ''décroissance'' in the title of the French translation. The book gained influence in French intellectual and academic circles from the outset. Later, the book was expanded and republished in 1995, and once again in 2006; however, the word ''Demain'' ('Tomorrow') was removed from the title of the book in these second and third editions.&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|1742}}&lt;ref name=ngr03/&gt; &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|15f}}

By the time Grinevald suggested the term ''décroissance'' to form part of the title of the French translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work, this term had already disseminated through French intellectual circles since the early 1970s to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and voluntary basis.&lt;ref name=fd01/&gt;{{rp|195}} Simultaneously, but independently hereof, Georgescu-Roegen had criticised the ideas of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' and [[Herman Daly]]'s [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economy]] in his pointed and polemical article on ''Energy and Economic Myths'', delivered as a series of lectures from 1972 and onwards at various places, but not published in print before 1975. In this article, Georgescu-Roegen stated the following view:

{{cquote | [Authors who] were set exclusively on proving the impossibility of growth ... were easily deluded by a simple, now widespread, but false [[syllogism]]: Since exponential growth in a finite world leads to disasters of all kinds, ecological salvation lies in the stationary state. ... The crucial error consists in not seeing that not only growth, but also a zero-growth state, nay, even a declining state which does not converge toward annihilation, cannot exist forever in a finite environment.&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|366f}}&lt;br&gt;... [T]he important, yet unnoticed point [is] that ''the necessary conclusion of the arguments in favor of that vision'' [of a stationary state] ''is that the most desirable state is not a stationary, but a declining one.'' Undoubtedly, the current growth must cease, nay, be reversed.&lt;ref name=ngr02/&gt;{{rp|368f}} [Emphasis in original] }}

When reading this particular passage of the text, Grinevald realised that no professional economist of any orientation had ever reasoned like this before. Grinevald also realised the striking conceptual resemblance between Georgescu-Roegen's viewpoint and the French debates progressing by the time; this resemblance then transformed into the title of the French edition. Taken together, the translation of Georgescu-Roegen's work into French ''both'' fed on ''and'' gave further impetus to the concept of ''décroissance'' in the country—and everywhere else in the francophone world—thereby creating something of an intellectual feedback loop.&lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|1742}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|15f}} &lt;ref name=fd01/&gt;{{rp|197f}}

By the 2000s, when ''décroissance'' was to be translated from French and back into English as the catchy banner for the new social movement, the original term 'decline' was now deemed inappropriate and misdirected for the purpose: 'Decline' usually refers to an unexpected, unwelcome and temporary economic [[recession]], something bad to be avoided or quickly overcome. Instead, the [[neologism]] 'degrowth' was coined to signify a deliberate political action to downscale the economy on a permanent and voluntary basis—as in the prevailing French usage of the term—something good to be welcomed and maintained, or so followers believe.&lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|548}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|15f}} &lt;ref name=gk01/&gt;{{rp|874–876}}

When the first international degrowth conference of its kind was held in Paris in 2008, the participants bestowed a generous amount of credit and appreciation on Georgescu-Roegen and his work.&lt;ref name=ff01/&gt;{{rp|15f, 28, ''et passim''}} Further, in his [[manifesto]] on ''Petit traité de la décroissance sereine'' ('Farewell to Growth'), leading French champion of the degrowth movement [[Serge Latouche]] has credited Georgescu-Roegen as 'a main theoretical source of degrowth.'&lt;ref name=sl01/&gt;{{rp|13–16}} Likewise, Italian degrowth theorist [[Mauro Bonaiuti]] has considered Georgescu-Roegen's work to be 'one of the analytical cornerstones of the degrowth perspective.'&lt;ref name=mb01/&gt;{{rp|xi}}

=== Serge Latouche ===
[[File:Serge Latouche - Festival Economia 2012.JPG|thumb|200px|Serge Latouche]]
[[Serge Latouche]], a professor of economics at the [[University of Paris-Sud]], has noted that:

{{quote|If you try to measure the reduction in the rate of growth by taking into account damages caused to the environment and its consequences on our natural and cultural patrimony, you will generally obtain a result of zero or even negative growth. In 1991, the United States spent 115 billion dollars, or 2.1% of the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] on the protection of the environment. The [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] increased this cost by 45 or 55 million dollars per year. [...] The [[World Resources Institute]] tried to measure the rate of the growth taking into account the punishment exerted on the [[natural capital]] of the world, with an eye towards sustainable development. For Indonesia, it found that the rate of growth between 1971 and 1984 would be reduced from 7.1 to 4% annually, and that was by taking only three variables into consideration: [[deforestation]], the reduction in the reserves of oil and natural gas, and [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref&gt;Hervé Kempf, ''L'économie à l'épreuve de l'écologie'' Hatier&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Latouche, Serge (2003) ''Decrecimiento y post-desarrollo'' El viejo topo, p.62&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Schumacher and Buddhist economics ===
[[E. F. Schumacher]]'s 1973 book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]'' predates a unified degrowth movement, but nonetheless serves as an important basis for degrowth ideas. In this book he critiques the [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal]] model of economic development, arguing that an increasing "standard of living", based on consumption, is absurd as a goal of economic activity and development. Instead, under what he refers to as [[Buddhist economics]], we should aim to maximize well-being while minimizing consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E. F. (1973). Small is Beautiful: Economics as if People Mattered. New York: Perennial Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecological and social issues ===
In January 1972 [[Edward Goldsmith]] and Robert Prescott-Allen—editors of ''[[The Ecologist]]'' journal—published ''[[A Blueprint for Survival]]'', which called for a radical programme of decentralisation and [[deindustrialization]] to prevent what the authors referred to as ''"the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet"''.

===Conferences===
The movement has also included international conferences,&lt;ref name="MOINS12"&gt;{{fr}} « La genèse du Réseau Objection de Croissance en Suisse », Julien Cart, in ''[[Moins!]]'', journal [[Suisse romande|romand]] d'écologie politique, n°12, juillet-août 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; promoted by the network Research&amp;Degrowth (R&amp;D),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://degrowth.org/|title=Research &amp; Degrowth|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Paris]] (2008),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://events.it-sudparis.eu/degrowthconference/|title=Décroissance économique pour la soutenabilité écologique et l'équité sociale|accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barcelona]] (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barcelona.degrowth.org/|title=Degrowth Conference Barcelona 2010|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Montreal]] (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montreal.degrowth.org/|title=International Conference on Degrowth in the Americas}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Venice]] (2012),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venezia2012.it/|title=International Degrowth Conference Venezia 2012 |accessdate=5 Dec 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leipzig]] (2014), [[Budapest]] (2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://degrowth.org/2015/03/26/5-international-degrowth-conference-budapest-2016/|accessdate=2018-01-31|title=5^ International Degrowth Conference in Budapest}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Malmö]] (2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://malmo.degrowth.org|title=Dialogues in turbulent times|website=Dialogues in turbulent times|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barcelona Conference (2010)===
The First International Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity of [[Paris]] (2008) was a discussion about the financial, social, cultural, demographic, environmental crisis caused by the deficiencies of [[capitalism]] and an explanation of the main principles of the degrowth.&lt;ref&gt;''Declaration of the Paris 2008 Conference''. Retrieved from: http://degrowth.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Declaration-Degrowth-Paris-2008.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Second International Conference of [[Barcelona]] on the other hand focused on specific ways to implement a degrowth society.

Concrete proposals have been developed for future political actions, including:
* Promotion of [[Local currency|local currencies]], elimination of [[fiat money]] and reforms of [[interest]]
* Transition to non-profit and small scale companies
* Increase of local commons and support of participative approaches in [[decision-making]]
* Reducing working hours and facilitation of [[volunteering|volunteer work]]
* Reusing empty housing and [[cohousing]]
* Introduction of the [[basic income]] and an income ceiling built on a maximum-minimum ratio
* Limitation of the [[exploitation of natural resources]] and preservation of the [[biodiversity]] and culture by regulations, taxes and compensations
* Minimize the [[waste]] production with education and legal instruments
* Elimination of mega infrastructures, transition from a car-based system to a more local, biking, walking-based one.
* Suppression of advertising from the public space&lt;ref&gt;2nd Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Ethic. 2010. ''Degrowth Declaration Barcelona 2010'' and ''Working Groups Results''. Retrieved from: http://barcelona.degrowth.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the real willingness of reform and the development of numerous solutions, the conference of Barcelona didn’t have a big influence on the world economic and political system. Many critiques have been made concerning the proposals, mostly about the financial aspects, and this has refrained changes to occur.&lt;ref&gt;Responsabilité, Innovation &amp; Management. 2011. ''Décroissance économique pour l’écologie, l’équité et le bien-vivre par François SCHNEIDER.'' Retrieved from http://www.openrim.org/Decroissance-economique-pour-l.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Degrowth around the world ===
Although not explicitly called Degrowth, movements using similar concepts and terminologies can be found around the world, such as Buen Vivir&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/blog/buen-vivir-philosophy-south-america-eduardo-gudynas|title=Buen vivir: the social philosophy inspiring movements in South America|last=Balch|first=Oliver|date=2013-02-04|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Latin America or Eco-Swaraj&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://degrowthcanada.wordpress.com/2015/12/28/alternatives-to-sustainable-development-buen-vivir-degrowth-and-eco-swaraj/|title="Alternatives to Sustainable Development: Buen vivir, Degrowth and Eco-Swaraj"|last=Thomson|first=Bob|date=2015-12-28|website=Degrowth / Decroissance Canada|access-date=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; in India.

=== Relation to other social movements ===
The degrowth movement has a variety of relations to other social movements and alternative economic visions, which range from collaboration to partial overlap. The Konzeptwerk Neue Ökonomie (Laboratory for New Economic Ideas), which hosted the 2014 international Degrowth conference in Leipzig, has published a project entitled “Degrowth in movement(s)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.degrowth.info/en/dim/degrowth-in-movements/|title=Degrowth in movement(s)|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;” in 2017, which maps relationships with 32 other social movements and initiatives.

== Criticisms ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2013}}

===Marxist critique===
{{See also | Steady-state economy #Capitalism without growth }}
[[Marxism|Marxists]] distinguish between two types of growth: that which is useful to mankind, and that which simply exists to increase profits for companies. Marxists consider that it is the nature and control of production that is the determinant, and not the quantity. They believe that control and a strategy for growth are the pillars that enable social and economic development. According to Jean Zin, while the justification for degrowth is valid, it is not a solution to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;''L'écologie politique à l'ère de l'information'', Ere, 2006, p. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;
However, other Marxist writers have adopted positions close to the de-growth perspective.  For example, [[John Bellamy Foster]]&lt;ref name="The Ecological Rift"&gt;https://monthlyreview.org/press/books/pb2181/, Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Fred Magdoff,&lt;ref name="Harmony and Ecological Civilization, Monthly review, Vol 44 (2), 1-9"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2012/06/01/harmony-and-ecological-civilization|title=Harmony and Ecological Civilization: Beyond the Capitalist Alienation of Nature|work=Monthly Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; in common with [[David Harvey]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Paul Sweezy]] and others focus on endless [[capital accumulation]] as the basic principle and goal of capitalism.  This is the source of economic growth and, in the view of these writers, is unsustainable.  Foster and Magdoff develop Marx's own concept of the metabolic rift, something he noted in the exhaustion of soils by capitalist systems of food production, though this is not unique to capitalist systems of food production as seen in the [[Aral Sea]].

===Systems theoretical critique===
In stressing the negative rather than the positive side(s) of growth, the majority of degrowth proponents remains focused on (de-)growth, thus co-performing and further sustaining the actually criticised unsustainable growth obsession. One way out of this paradox might be in changing the reductionist vision of growth as ultimately economic concept, which proponents of both growth and degrowth commonly imply, for a broader concept of growth that allows for the observation of growth in other [[Differentiation (sociology)|function systems]] of society. A corresponding recoding of growth-obsessed or capitalist organisations has recently been proposed.&lt;ref name="Growth and function. A viral research program for next organizations, International Journal of Technology Management"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://steffenroth.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/15-12-15-growth-and-function1.pdf|last=Roth|first=Steffen|title=Growth and function.

'''''Du-reformen''''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈdʉː reˈfɔrmən}}, ''the you-reform'') was the process in the late 1960s of popularization of the [[Grammatical person|second-person]] [[singular number|singular]] [[pronoun]] ''du'' as a universal form of address in [[Sweden]]. The use of ''[[wikt:du#Swedish|du]]'' ([[cognate]] with English ''[[thou]]'', French ''tu'', and German ''du'') replaced an intricate former system where people chiefly addressed each other in third person, with or without a preceding Mr./Mrs./Ms. ''(herr, fru ''or'' fröken)'' before the title, often omitting both [[surname]] and given name. Less respectfully, people could be addressed with Mr./Mrs./Ms. plus surname, or in a family setting, alternatively even less respectfully, with the plain name or third person pronoun ''han'' ("he") or ''hon'' (she).

Before ''du-reformen,'' it was considered impolite to address most people without an appropriate title, although a subordinate could be addressed by name, or less respectfully as ''Ni'' or ''han/hon.'' The informal ''du'' had been used for addressing children, siblings, close friends and possibly for [[cousin]]s, but hardly for elder relatives. Members of [[Free church]]es, [[Good Templars]] and the like considered each other as siblings, and may well have used ''Du'' in that setting.

With exception for [[dialect]]al usage, the second person plural pronoun ''Ni'' had long been considered degrading when used to address a single person. However, the usage varied between different parts of the country, and as well by social context, both before and after the reform. 

[[Finland-Swedish]] has undergone a similar development, but slower and slightly less due to influence of the somewhat more conservative usage in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. In particular, the use of second person plural ''(Ni)'' to address an unknown person is considered respectful or neutral rather than degrading.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
In the Swedish of Sweden, the polite ''ni'' was known from earlier epochs, but had come to be considered careless, bullying or rude; instead, an intricate system had evolved in order to prudently step around pronouns almost altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sweden.se/eng/Home/Education/Swedish-language/Reading/How-the-Swedish-language-lost-its-formality/ |title=How the Swedish language lost its formality |last=Hellström |first=Elin |author= |date=Jun 7, 2011 |year= |department= |website=sweden.se |series= |publisher=[[Swedish Institute]] |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120911224725/http://www.sweden.se/eng/Home/Education/Swedish-language/Reading/How-the-Swedish-language-lost-its-formality/ |archive-date=2012-09-11 |dead-url=yes |access-date=Feb 1, 2017 |quote=Previously, the proper way to address people of the same or higher social status had been by title and surname. Colleagues spoke to each other in a more formal way at the office, asking if  “Accountant Olsson could send the invoice” or if “Managing Director Johnsson would mind postponing the meeting.” The use of herr (mr), fru (mrs) or fröken (miss) was considered acceptable in initial conversation with strangers of unknown occupation, academic title or military rank. |ref= |postscript= |subscription= |registration= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Addressing in third [[person (grammar)|person]] singular adding '''title and surname''' was considered proper and respectful in most cases. But with persons of higher standing, say a doctor, count or managing director, there arose the question when to use that title only and when to precede it with a ''herr'' ('mister' or, in this context, 'sir'); not doubling such titles could be very rude unless you were on somewhat informal terms.  A woman, married to a husband with a specific title, was addressed using the ''feminine form of her husband's title'' as a matter of course. This created its own set of problems as more and more women acquired professional titles of their own.

*If two persons were somewhat acquainted and not too far apart in rank and age, they could then drop the name and use the '''title only'''. 

*'''Surname without title''' was considered proper between friends not too close and for a superior to his subordinate or someone of similar rank. That was also customary in male brotherhoods like between students.

*Below that on the social scale, both among peers and from above, was the '''third person singular pronoun only''' (''han'' 'he', ''hon'' 'she'). That was more usual in the countryside; considered rustic by "educated" people, but fitting towards e.g. an old fisher- or woodman.

*Simple folks of venerable age could be properly addressed '''father/mother/aunt plus Christian name''' ''(far/mor/moster)'', both by their own, by other villagers and by superiors. A farmwife could be addressed as ''mor'' even if young; otherwise, one had to make do with the nearest-fitting other way of addressing.

*A master could address his servant, and a farmer his farmhand, by '''Christian name in the third person'''; that was more common between females, as the female world was generally more confined, but more restricted between the sexes. A subordinate, in each case, answered by using the superior's title or, in private, the informal term for his rank (e.g. ''herrn'', ''patron'').

*The proper '''kinship term plus Christian name''', still never alternating with pronoun, was proper in private to nearer relatives.

The second person singular ''du'' was used only to and between children, within a married couple, between lovers or to a more or less voluntary mistress of lower standing, and between friends who had toasted for brotherhood with each other ('toasted for thou' in a ''"du-skål"'' as it was known)—of course initiated by the elder or higher-ranked party. Again, the custom could be slightly more relaxed among women—at least the toast itself was usually dispensed with. Otherwise, ''du'' could be used to insult a tramp or the like.

Parts of this system began to erode around the Second World War or so, but the essentials held up into the late 1960s.

In the province of [[Dalarna]], however, and in a some other remote places with few upper-class people, the ''du/ni'' distinction had remained one of number only; although children addressed their parents with Father/Mother ''(Far/Mor)'' rather than a grammatically logical ''du.'' In other remote places, the ''Ni'' survived in its older form ''I'' (cognate with '[[Ye (pronoun)|ye]]') as both the second person plural pronoun and the polite address to singular elders, including one's parents, unless classified with "better people". In [[Standard language|standard]] Swedish, that form had become archaic and solemn well before the 20th century. (''I'' is capitalized to avoid confusion with a common [[homograph]], the preposition ''[[wikt:i#Swedish|i]]'' ('in'), rather than of respect.)

As the twentieth century progressed, this circumlocutive system of addressing, with its innumerable ambiguities and opportunities for unintentional offence, was increasingly felt as a nuisance. An early way out was to carry the circumlocutions one degree further—finding impersonal ways of saying what was needful, avoiding both personal pronoun and title (''Får det lov att vara en kopp kaffe?'', approximately 'Might it be a cup of coffee?'; ''Så det är till att resa?'', approximately 'So, it is about travelling?'), often using the [[passive voice]]. However, that soon proved of little avail. For one thing, you still had to address the person you talked with directly from time to time in the conversation, otherwise you would really have sounded impolite—and over time, it became ''de rigueur'' to do so more and more often, until it was a system with both longish titles used instead of personal pronouns and impersonal circumlocutions; and for another, the impersonal constructions soon acquired their own gradations, to be observant upon—e.g., that in the second example above being perceived as more and more rustic, ending up rude.

==Reform==
The beginning of ''du-reformen'' is associated with [[Bror Rexed]], the then head of the [[National Board of Health and Welfare (Sweden)|National Board of Health and Welfare]] (''Socialstyrelsen''), who in his welcome speech to the staff in 1967 announced that he would address everyone as ''du'', increasing the effects of the reform and bringing it to a more frequent use. 

The actual reform had started earlier, including the amended language in the major newspaper [[Dagens Nyheter]]. It was seen as a reform in a democratic and egalitarian direction. First, authorities and influential circles had tried rehabilitating the ''Ni'' in a so-called "''ni''-reform". But most people could not bring themselves to feel civil using that. Then, in a process dubbed the "''du'' reform", the system rapidly broke down and the informal ''du'' became the accepted way of addressing any one person except royalty.

Addressing [[Swedish Royal Family]] also changed, but third person addressing still dominates in official settings. The universal ''ers majestät'' ('Your Majesty'), etc. became rare, possibly used on formal occasions, and is replaced by ''[[wikt:konung#Swedish|konungen]]'' or ''[[wikt:kung#Swedish|kungen]]'' ("the King"), ''kronprinsessan'' ("the Crown Princess"), etc. 

In parallel with ''du-reformen'', the use of [[title]]s was further reduced. In many other countries, [[professional title]]s rather than names are used to attract someone’s attention, while this is not usually the case in Sweden. Only slightly less accepted is the use of [[Christian name]] also when addressing an  acquaintance or colleague (''Daniel, Pia,'' etc.).

Since about 1990, it has become somewhat more common for retail and restaurant staff to address customers as ''ni'' (second-person plural), although this was not formerly considered formal language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.se/ni-tilltal Nationalencyklopedin].&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Riksdag]], where debate is conducted via the [[Speaker of the Riksdag|Speaker]], titles are frequently used, even though politicians are most often addressed as ''du'' in other contexts.

In order to "alleviate the intrusion" in writing, e.g. in letters or in advertisement, the ''Du'' can be capitalized. That usage was most widespread in the early days of universal ''du'' address; it has become slightly more common again simultaneously with the partial ''Ni'' revival.

'''eOTD''' is the acronym for the '''ECCMA Open Technical Dictionary'''. The dictionary is a language-independent database of [[concept]]s with associated terms, definitions and images used to unambiguously describe individuals, organizations, locations, goods, services, processes, rules, and regulations. The eOTD is maintained by the [[Electronic Commerce Code Management Association]] ([[ECCMA]]).

== History ==
The eOTD was developed with the support of the Defense Logistics Information Service (DLIS) an agency of the US Defense Logistics Agency (DLA).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; eOTD concept identifiers are used to create unambiguous language independent descriptions of individuals, organizations, locations, goods, services, processes, rules and regulations. The process of using concept identifiers from an external open technical dictionary is a form of semantic encoding compliant with the requirements of [[ISO 8000]]-110:2008, the international standard for the exchange of quality master data.

The eOTD concept identifiers are in the public domain. Using public domain identifiers as metadata creates portable data that can be legally separated from the software application that was used to create it. The dictionary contains concepts from international, national and industry standards including over 400,000 concepts of class (approved item name), property (attribute), units of measure, currency and common enumerated value (e.g., days of the week). The eOTD does not include a class hierarchy or class-property relationships.

== Use ==
Companies use the eOTD to create data requirement specifications as Identification Guides (IGs) or cataloging templates. These Identification Guides contain the class-property relationships and are used for cataloging, to measure data quality as well as to create requests for data or requests for data validation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29482">'''Egocentric bias''' is the tendency to rely too heavily on one's own perspective and/or have a higher opinion of oneself than reality.&lt;ref name="Schacter2011" /&gt; It appears to be the result of the psychological need to satisfy one's [[Ego (Freudian)|ego]] and to be advantageous for [[memory consolidation]]. Research has shown that experiences, ideas, and beliefs are more easily recalled when they match one's own, causing an [[Egocentrism|egocentric]] outlook. [[Michael Ross (psychologist)|Michael Ross]] and [[Fiore Sicoly]] first identified this [[cognitive bias]] in their 1979 paper, "Egocentric biases in availability and attribution".&lt;ref name="RossSicoly1979" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Holtgraves2014" /&gt; Egocentric bias is referred to by most psychologists as a general umbrella term under which other related phenomena fall.

The effects of egocentric bias can differ based on personal characteristics, such as age and the number of languages one speaks.   Thus far, there have been many studies focusing on specific implications of egocentric bias in different contexts.  Research on collaborative group tasks have emphasized that people view their own contributions differently than they view that of others.  Other areas of research have been aimed at studying how mental health patients display egocentric bias, and at the relationship between egocentric bias and voter distribution.  These types of studies surrounding egocentric bias usually involve written or verbal questionnaires, based on the subject's personal life or their decision in various hypothetical scenarios.

== History and analysis ==
The term "egocentric bias" was first coined in 1980 by [[Anthony Greenwald]], a psychologist at Ohio State University.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  He described it as a phenomenon in which people skew their beliefs so that what they recall from their memory or what they initially understood is different than what actually occurred.  He cites research by Rogers, Kuiper, and Kirker, who explain that the [[self-reference effect]] is the ability of people to recall information better if they think about how the information will affect them during the [[encoding (memory)|encoding]] process (recording memories in their brain).  Greenwald argues that the self-reference effect causes people to exaggerate their role in a situation.  Furthermore, information is better encoded, and thus people are more likely to suffer from egocentric bias, if they produce information actively rather than passively, such as by having a direct role in the outcome of a situation.

Egocentric bias occurs when people fail to consider situations from other people's perspectives.  Egocentric bias has influenced ethical judgements to the point where people not only believe that self-interested outcomes are preferential but are also the morally sound way to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Epley|first=Nicholas|last2=Caruso|first2=Eugene M.|year=2004|title=Egocentric Ethics|url=http://pbjlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ego_ethics.pdf|journal=Social Justice Research|volume=17|pages=171–187|via=|doi=10.1023/b:sore.0000027408.72713.45}}&lt;/ref&gt;   People are more inclined to be aware of their own behaviors since they can use their thoughts and emotions to gain more information about themselves.  These thoughts and emotions can affect how people view themselves in relation to others in specific situations.  A common example arises when people are asked to explain how much credit should be given to each person in a collaborative project.  [[Daniel Schacter]], a psychology professor at Harvard University, considers egocentric bias as one of the [[seven sins of memory|"seven sins" of memory]] and essentially reflects the prominent role played by the self when encoding and retrieving [[episodic memories]]. As such, people often feel that their contributions to a collaborative project are greater than those of other members, since people tend to focus more on how much they have done.&lt;ref name="Tanaka1993" /&gt;

In social context, egocentric bias influences people to choose a social circle that is capable of maintaining one's positive traits. Studies show that one's choice of friend or social circle is likely to be dependent on the amount of positive feedback received.&lt;ref name="Clark2009" /&gt;

== Examples ==
In a 1993 study conducted in Japan, subjects were asked to write down fair or unfair behaviors that they themselves or others did. When writing about fair behavior, they tended to start with the word "I" rather than "others". Likewise, they began unfair behaviors with "others" rather than "I". This demonstrates that people tend to attribute successes and positive behaviors to themselves, while placing the burden of failures and negative behaviors on others.&lt;ref name="Tanaka1993" /&gt; Furthermore, in this study there were gender differences detected; Japanese women, compared to men, remembered the behaviors of others more than their own, and were also more probable to characterize fair or unfair behavior to others compared to themselves.&lt;ref name="Tanaka1993" /&gt;

Another study found that egocentric bias influences perceived fairness. Subjects felt that overpayment to themselves were more fair than overpayment to others; by contrast, they felt the underpayment to themselves were less fair than underpayment to others. Greenberg's studies showed that this egocentrism was eliminated when the subjects were put in a self-aware state, which was applied in his study with a mirror being placed in front of the subjects. When a person is not self-aware, they perceive that something can be fair to them but not necessarily fair to others. Therefore, fairness was something biased and subjective. When a person is self-aware, there is a uniform standard of fairness and there is no bias. When made self-aware, subjects rated overpayment and underpayment to both themselves and to others as equally unfair. It is believed that these results were obtained because self-awareness elevated subjects' concerns about perceived fairness in payment, thereby overriding egocentric tendencies.&lt;ref name="Greenberg1983" /&gt;

The egocentric bias can also be clearly observed in young children, especially those who have not yet developed [[theory of mind]], or the ability to understand concrete situations from the perspective of others. In one study by Wimmer and Perner, a child and a stuffed animal were presented with two differently colored boxes and both are shown that one contains an object of interest. The experimenter then removed the stuffed animal from the room and moved the object into the other box. When asked where the stuffed animal should search for the object, the children overwhelmingly tended to point to the box that they knew the object was in. Rather than thinking about the animal's perspective, the children displayed an egocentric bias in assuming that the animal would share their point of view, even though the animal had no way of knowing the same information as them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimmer|first=Heinz|last2=Perner|first2=Josef|date=1983-01-01|title=Beliefs about beliefs: Representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010027783900045|journal=Cognition|volume=13|issue=1|pages=103–128|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
The causes and motivations for egocentric bias were investigated in a 1983 journal entry by Brian Mullen of Murray State University. Inspired by the study by Ross et al. demonstrating the false consensus effect, Mullen's paper focused on the overestimation of consensus. Mullen analyzed the NBC television show "Play the Percentages" to determine whether egocentric bias was rooted in a perceptual  and unintentional distortion of reality versus a conscious, intentional motivation to appear normalized.  Subjects in this analysis were contestants from the show, 20–30 year old middle class married couple with equal gender distribution. At the start of each show, studio audiences were asked several trivia questions, and the percentage of correct answers was recorded for later use in the game. During each round of the game, opposing contestants estimated the percentage of correct answers. The contestant who had a closer estimate wins the percentage of correct answer as a score, and then if they answer said trivia question correctly, wins the remaining percentage for a maximum possible 100 points. The first couple to win 300 points received a cash prize, with the opportunity to win more prizes in bonus rounds. Thus, the show provided incentive for unbiased estimates of consensus. Statistical analysis of the collected data showed that the "egocentric bias of false consensus was observed in spite of the potent incentive for unbiased estimates of consensus." This analysis ultimately supports the hypothesis that egocentric bias is a result of unintentional perceptual distortion of reality rather than a conscious, intentional motivation to appear normalized.&lt;ref name="Mullen1983" /&gt;

From a psychological standpoint, memories appear to be stored in the brain in an egocentric manner: the role of oneself is magnified in one's experiences to make them more personally relevant and thereby easier to recall. Early childhood memories, therefore, may be more difficult to recall since one's sense of self is less developed, so old memories do not connect as strongly to oneself as newer ones.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/12/science/a-bias-puts-self-at-center-of-everything.html|title=A bias puts self at center of everything|last=Goleman|first=Daniel|date=1984-06-12|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, egocentric bias may have evolved from [[hunter-gatherer]] times, in which communities were small and interdependent enough that individuals could assume that others around them had very similar outlooks. An egocentric view would have reduced [[cognitive load]] and increased communication efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peters|first=Uwe|date=2015-12-01|title=Human thinking, shared intentionality, and egocentric biases|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-015-9512-0|journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy|language=en|volume=31|issue=2|pages=299–312|doi=10.1007/s10539-015-9512-0|issn=0169-3867|pmc=4771814|pmid=27013769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of personal characteristics ==

=== Age ===
A 2016 study published by Riva, Triscoli, Lamm, Carnaghi, and Silani found that egocentric bias tends to be experienced in a much greater degree by adolescents and older adults than by young and middle aged adults. They examined the emotional effect of visuo-tactile stimulation on pairs of participants from a population of 114 female of varying ages. The varying degree of egocentric bias with age was attributed to the developmental cycle of the right [[supramarginal gyrus]] (rSMG) of the [[parietal lobe]], which finishes developing at the end of adolescence and decays early.&lt;ref name="NCBI"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Triscoli|first2=Chantal|last3=Lamm|first3=Claus|last4=Carnaghi|first4=Andrea|last5=Silani|first5=Giorgia|date=April 26, 2016|title=Emotional Egocentricity Bias Across the Life-Span|pmc=4844617|journal=Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=74|last1=Riva|first1=Frederica|doi=10.3389/fnagi.2016.00074|pmid=27199731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Billingualism ===
Recent studies of egocentric bias have been done in many different subgroups of people, such as [[bilingual]] people.  A study done by Paula Rubio-Fernández and [[Sam Glucksberg]] found that bilingual people are less prone to egocentric bias because they have grown to pay more attention to others' thoughts.  Thus, it is less difficult for them to differentiate between their own opinions and those of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubio-Fernández|first=Paula|last2=Glucksberg|first2=Sam|date=2012-01-01|title=Reasoning about other people's beliefs: Bilinguals have an advantage.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/38/1/211/|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|language=English|volume=38|issue=1|pages=211–217|doi=10.1037/a0025162|issn=1939-1285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related phenomena ==

=== False-consensus effect ===
{{Main|False-consensus effect}}
Considered to be a facet of egocentric bias, the false-consensus effect states that people believe their thoughts, actions, and opinions are much more common than they are in reality.&lt;ref name="Mullen1983" /&gt; When people are asked to make an estimate of a population's statistic, they often only have data from themselves and tend to assume that others in the population are similar to them due to egocentric bias. In turn, people tend to overestimate the extent to which their opinion is shared by the rest of the population. Moreover, people tend to believe that those who differ in opinion must be part of a minority and that the majority actually agrees with them. Therefore, the false-consensus effect, or the tendency to deduce judgements from own's own opinions, is a direct result of egocentric bias.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krueger|first=Joachim|year=1994|title=The Truly False Consensus Effect: An Ineradicable and Egocentric Bias in Social Perception|url=http://files.clps.brown.edu/jkrueger/journal_articles/krueger-1994-trulyfalse.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=67|issue=4|pages=596–610|via=|pmid=7965607|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well known example of false-consensus effect is a study published by Ross, Greene and House in 1977.&lt;ref name="Ross1977" /&gt; Students are asked to walk around a campus with a sandwich board that bearing the word "repent". People who agreed to do so (50%) estimated that most of their peers would also agree to do so (average estimation 63.5%). Conversely, those who refused to do the experiment reported that most of their peers would refuse as well.&lt;ref name="Wallin2011" /&gt;

People who exhibit the false consensus effect take egocentric bias a step further: they not only forgo thinking of other perspectives, but they believe that their viewpoints are those accepted by the majority of people.  Nevertheless, some psychologists do not distinguish between egocentric bias and the false consensus effect.  For example, in the paper published by Ross,  Greene, and House, the terms "false consensus" and "egocentric attribution bias" are used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="Ross1977" /&gt;  In the second part of their study, they gave out a questionnaire which asked participants which option (out of two choices) they would choose in specified situations, and what percentage of the population would choose which option.  In all four scenarios that were given, subjects rated the option that they chose as the most probable.  Ross, Greene, and House conclude that their results support the false consensus hypothesis, and that "intuitive estimates of deviance and normalcy, and the host of social inferences and interpersonal responses that accompany such estimates, are systematically and egocentrically biased in accord with his own behavioral choices."&lt;ref name="Ross1977" /&gt;

===Self-serving bias===
{{Main|Self-serving bias}}
A related concept to egocentric bias is self-serving bias, in which one takes undue credit for achievements and blames failures on external forces. However, egocentric bias differs from self-serving bias in that egocentric bias is rooted in an erroneous assumption of other's perception of reality, while self-serving bias is an erroneous perception of one's own reality. For example, consider a student who earns a low grade in a class. Self-serving bias would result in the assumption that the student's low grade is a result of poor teaching, which would direct the fault of one's reality away from one's own actions.

Egocentric bias might also result in an overestimation of the number of students that received low grades in the class for the purpose to normalize these students' performance. However, similar to the false-consensus effect, the self-serving bias and the egocentric bias have also been used as interchangeable terms.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0L7dwJKel8C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q=egocentric%20bias%20vs%20self-serving%20bias|title=Handbook of Cross-cultural Psychology: Social behavior and applications|last=Berry|first=John W.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=John Berry|isbn=9780205160761|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both concepts may be the product of individualistic cultures that usually stress independence and personal achievement over group-oriented success. Cross-cultural studies have found a strong presence of the egocentric bias in the primarily individualistic American, South African, and Yugoslavian communities, but noted the opposite effect in the collectivistic [[Japan]]ese, [[Nepal]]i, and [[India]]n societies. People from these cultures tend to demonstrate a bias toward modesty, in which success is attributed to external or group-related factors and failures are seen as the result of personal shortcomings.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

=== Bayesian inference ===
[[Bayesian reasoning]] is a form of statistical inference that relies on [[Bayes' rule]] to make probability prediction based on given information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engelmann|first1=Dirk|last2=Strobel|first2=Martin|title=The False Consensus Effect Disappears if Representative Information and Monetary Incentives Are Given|journal=Experimental Economics|date=2001|volume=3|pages=241–260|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.535.9974&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=5 December 2016|doi=10.1007/bf01669774}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Bayesian updating, people use prior probabilities to make estimates, and then gradually change these probabilities as they gain more information.  [[Bayesian inference]] is often used by psychologists to determine whether subjects who exhibit the false-consensus effect have a rational thought process. To understand Bayes' rule, consider an example from an experiment by Kreuger and Clement: there is an urn with 100 chips, some blue and some red, and then subjects are told that the first chip drawn from the urn is blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krueger|first1=Joachim|last2=Russell W.|first2=Clement|title=The truly false consensus effect: An ineradicable and egocentric bias in social perception|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=October 1994|volume=67|issue=4|pages=596–610|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.4.596|pmid=7965607}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subjects are asked to estimate the probability that the urn contains predominantly blue chips. Using Bayes' rule, the probability that a blue chip is drawn given that the urn contains predominantly blue chips is equal to the probability of the urn being predominantly blue multiplied by the probability of the urn being predominantly blue given that a blue chip was drawn, all divided by the probability that the urn is predominantly blue.  Most participants overestimated the requested probability.  Data shows that subjects tend not to pay attention to sample size when making probability predictions.  For example, although it has statistically been proven by the law of large numbers that larger samples have less variability, people tend to claim that large and small samples have the same amount of variability.  Studies like the urn experiment above provide evidence that the false-consensus effect is not entirely rational, and that egocentric viewpoints tend to be predominant.

== Real-world implications ==

===Collaboration===
Egocentric bias can lead to the devaluation of peer contributions and the amplification of one's own work when in a collaborative setting. For example, when group members have been asked to report what percentage of the output they created, the total summed to greater than 100%. Usually, individuals are more easily able to recall their personal contributions and thus believe them to greater or more important. This applies to both positive and negative inputs: in a study of married couples, each spouse rated themselves as more responsible for helpful (cleaning) and detractive activities (causing arguments).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Egocentric Bias|last=Savitsky|first=Ken|doi=10.4135/9781412956253.n169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has shown that feelings of sibling caregivers and their siblings depend on the contact between siblings and their feelings of closeness.&lt;ref name="Oxford Journals"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lerner|first1=Melvin J.|last2=Tierney|first2=Mary|last3=Somers|first3=Darryl G.|last4=Reid|first4=David|last5=Chiriboga|first5=David|title=Adult Children as Caregivers: Egocentric Biases in Judgments of Sibling Contributions|date=1991|pages=746–755|edition=31|url=http://gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org/content/31/6/746.short|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these two groups believed that their siblings contributed less to the needs of their family than themselves, and were more resistant to increasing these types of contributions.  The closer that siblings were to each other, measured through observation and self reports, the smaller the extent of egocentric bias they felt in reporting each sibling's contribution.

===Mental health===
An overly exaggerated or extremely low demonstration of egocentric bias could be an indicator of mental illness. Those with anxiety tend to view themselves as the center of all events around them, regardless of their nature or how unrelated they are to oneself.  On the other hand, people suffering from depression may have a lower tendency towards egocentricity, as evidenced by the fact that they tend to more realistically rate their contributions to group work, while non-depressed participants often overreport their additions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Voting===
The egocentric bias has also been shown to contribute to a citizen's decision to vote in elections. Firstly, people tend to view their personal choice between voting and abstinence as a reflection of those who support the same candidates and issues. Secondly, although each individual vote has very little power in large-scale elections, those who vote overestimate the significance their ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acevedo|first=Melissa|last2=Krueger|first2=Joachim I.|date=2004-02-01|title=Two Egocentric Sources of the Decision to Vote: The Voter's Illusion and the Belief in Personal Relevance|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00359.x/abstract|journal=Political Psychology|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=115–134|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00359.x|issn=1467-9221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, citizens demonstrate egocentric bias, in conjunction with the false-consensus effect, in their predictions of election outcomes. A study examining the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 American presidential election]] found that the more strongly people favor a certain candidate, the higher they estimate that candidate's likelihood of winning the election. For instance, those who strongly preferred Barack Obama predicted that he had a 65% chance of becoming the president, while those who preferred another candidate approximated that he only had a 40% chance of victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/02/in-politics-were-convinced-that-our-candidate-is-a-shoo-in/|title=Never mind the polls—we're convinced our candidate is going to win|newspaper=Ars Technica|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guglielmo Janni''' (born 1892 - died 1958), was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[Painting|painter]] belonging to the modern movement of the ''[[Scuola romana]] (Roman School)''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. R. Lucchese, ''Guglielmo Janni'', [[Rome]] 1972. See also [http://www.scuolaromana.it/artisti/janni.htm Scheda dell'artista], on ''Scuolaromana.it''. Accessed 27/05/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Son of a renowned Roman family - his father Giuseppe was a lawyer and his mother Teresa Belli was the niece of famous [[Italian poetry|Italian poet]] [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]] - Guglielmo Janni will be much influenced by his inherited literary background. He graduated at [[law]] in 1914 and, just after [[World War I]], he attended an [[Art Nouveau]] [[decorative arts|decorative]] course at the [[Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Rome]], while studying [[philosophy]] and [[literature]] on his own.

In 1921, he exhibited at the 1st [[Biennale]] of [[Rome]] and around 1924 he was called to decorate the Headquarters of the [[Banca d'Italia]], where he painted a [[mural]] on the history of [[Italy|Italian]] [[coin]]age. Between 1926 and 1927 he collaborated successively with the [[Ministry of the Interior]] and [[Ministry of Justice]], with the  [[Assicurazioni Generali|Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni]] and with [[Montecatini Terme]]. During this period (1923–1928), his main themes involved religious motifs and he exhibited his work at the II [[Biennale]] of [[Rome]]; at the Franciscan Art Contest of [[Milan]]; at the Art Show of the National Artists Association of [[Florence]]. Janni also became a lifelong friend of painter [[Alberto Ziveri]].

In 1928, Janni painted a [[fresco]] in the votive chapel of [[St. Bartholomew]] ("Monument to the Fallen") at [[Busseto]] ([[Parma]]), with influences from [[Piero della Francesca]]. He was congratulated by art critic [[Roberto Longhi]], who praised Janni's ''literary'' style of painting - an appropriate evaluation, as the artist's figurative work had acquired a "vocation to [[myth]]" that will be reflected in all his subsequent work: he will convey it through a tormented and sensual contemplation of the virile form, often concealed by an ambiguous and mundane veil:&lt;ref&gt;E.g., see his ''Pugile (Boxer)''[http://www.scuolaromana.it/opere/ope111.htm], ''Pesi e trapezi (Weights and Trapezes)'' [http://www.scuolaromana.it/opere/ope112.htm], ''Commedia dell'arte (Comedy of Art)''[http://www.scuolaromana.it/opere/ope114.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; his "[[Endymion (mythology)|Endymion]]" of 1931 confirms this fully.&lt;ref&gt;This painting was exhibited in 1934 at the ''Exhibition of Contemporary Italian Painting'' of [[Baltimore]] (United States).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giuseppe Ungaretti]] presented in a relevant catalogue, Janni's first personal [[art exhibition|exhibition]] at the [[Galleria della Cometa]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.scuolaromana.it/document/doc149.htm ''Catalogo della personale di Guglielmo Janni''], published in 1935 by Galleria della Cometa&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Rome]] in 1936, where many important paintings were displayed, among which: ''Figura d'aprile, Giovani atleti, Lo specchio, Figura di Balletto''. Highly acclaimed by public and art critics, he organised again at the same Gallery a second personal exhibition and, in 1936, he attended the [[Biennale di Venezia]] and displayed three paintings at the Modern Italian Art Expo of [[Budapest]].

After a visit to the [[Universal Exposition]] of [[Paris]] with [[Alberto Ziveri]] in 1937, Janni suffered an existential crisis and abandoned [[painting]] completely. He then decided to dedicate the rest of his life to studying, editing and cataloguing his grandfather [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli|Belli's]] unpublished writings, stored in the family library. Janni died while doing this labouring work, which included a monumental biographical opus on Belli's life and poetry, in ten volumes.&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Marcel Proust|Proustian]] style, Janni kept revising and rewriting whole chapters of his Belli biography, never satisfied with the final result. This work was published posthumously in 1967, condensed into 3 volumes, and edited by R. Lucchese ([[Milan]]). See also ''sub voce'', [[Enciclopedia Treccani]], ''Biographical Dictionary''[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/guglielmo-janni_(Dizionario-Biografico)/]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Human sexual activity''', '''human sexual practice''' or '''human sexual behaviour''' is the manner in which humans experience and express their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. People engage in a variety of sexual acts, ranging from activities done alone (e.g., [[masturbation]]) to acts with another person (e.g., [[sexual intercourse]], [[non-penetrative sex]], [[oral sex]], etc.) in varying patterns of frequency, for a wide variety of reasons. Sexual activity usually results in [[sexual arousal]] and physiological changes in the aroused person, some of which are pronounced while others are more subtle. Sexual activity may also include conduct and activities which are intended to arouse the sexual interest of another or enhance the [[sex life]] of another, such as strategies to find or attract partners ([[courtship]] and [[Display (zoology)|display]] behaviour), or personal interactions between individuals (for instance, [[foreplay]] or [[BDSM]]). Sexual activity may follow sexual arousal.

Human sexual activity has sociological, cognitive, [[Emotional intimacy|emotional]], [[Physical intimacy|behavioural]] and biological aspects; these include [[Human bonding|personal bonding]], sharing emotions and the [[physiology]] of the [[reproductive system]], [[sex drive]], sexual intercourse and sexual behaviour in all its forms.

In some cultures, sexual activity is considered acceptable only within marriage, while [[Premarital sex|premarital]] and [[extramarital sex]] are taboo. Some sexual activities are illegal either universally or in some countries or subnational jurisdictions, while some are considered contrary to the [[Norm (social)|norm]]s of certain societies or cultures. Two examples that are criminal offences in most&lt;!--virtually all?--&gt; [[jurisdiction]]s are [[sexual assault]] and sexual activity with a person below the local [[age of consent]].

Sexual activity can be classified in a number of ways: acts which involve one person (also called [[autoeroticism]]) such as [[masturbation]], or two or more people such as [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]], [[anal sex]], [[oral sex]] or [[mutual masturbation]]. If there are more than two participants in the sex act, it may be referred to as [[group sex]]. Autoerotic sexual activity can involve use of [[dildo]]s, [[Vibrator (sex toy)|vibrator]]s, [[anal beads]], and other [[sex toy]]s, though these devices can also be used with a partner.

Sexual activity can be classified into the [[gender]] and [[sexual orientation]] of the participants, as well as by the relationship of the participants. For example, the relationships can be ones of marriage, [[intimate partner]]s, casual [[sex partners]] or [[anonymous sex|anonymous]]. Sexual activity can be regarded as [[conventional sex|conventional]] or as [[Kink (sexual)|alternative]], involving, for example, [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], [[paraphilia]], or [[BDSM]] activities.&lt;ref name="channel1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |title=Sex and Relationships |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504202257/http://www.channel4.com/health/microsites/0-9/4health/sex/sar_tips.html |archivedate=4 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526192917/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 May 2012 |title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better. Think again – Sexual Fitness – physiology &amp;#124; Men's Fitness |publisher=Findarticles.com |accessdate=30 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fetishism can take many forms ranging from the desire for certain body parts, for example large breasts, navels or foot worship. The object of desire can often be shoes, boots, lingerie, clothing, leather or rubber items. Some non-conventional autoerotic practices can be dangerous. These include [[erotic asphyxiation]] and [[self-bondage]]. The potential for injury or even death that exists while engaging in the partnered versions of these fetishes ([[Fainting game|choking]] and [[Bondage (sexual)|bondage]], respectively) becomes drastically increased in the autoerotic case due to the isolation and lack of assistance in the event of a problem.

Sexual activity can be consensual, which means that both or all participants agree to take part and are of the age that they can consent, or it may take place under force or duress, which is often called [[sexual assault]] or rape. In different cultures and countries, various sexual activities may be lawful or illegal in regards to the age, gender, marital status or other factors of the participants, or otherwise contrary to [[social norms]] or generally accepted [[sexual morals]].

==Mating strategies==
In [[evolutionary psychology]] and [[behavioral ecology]], human mating strategies are a set of behaviors used by individuals to attract, select, and retain [[Mating|mates]]. Mating strategies overlap with [[reproductive]] strategies, which encompass a broader set of behaviors involving the timing of reproduction and the trade-off between quantity and quality of offspring (see [[life history theory]]).

Relative to other animals, human mating strategies are unique in their relationship with cultural variables such as the institution of [[marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;Low, B. S. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=8K7Hc09xcQAC&amp;pg=PA449#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ecological%20and%20socio-cultural%20impacts%20on%20mating%20and%20marriage%22 Ecological and socio-cultural impacts on mating and marriage]. Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, 449.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans may seek out individuals with the intention of forming a long-term [[intimate relationship]], marriage, [[casual relationship]], or [[friendship]]. The human desire for [[companionship]] is one of the strongest human drives. It is an innate feature of human nature, and may be related to the [[sex drive]]. The human mating process encompasses the social and cultural processes whereby one person may meet another to assess suitability, the [[courtship]] process and the process of forming an [[interpersonal relationship]]. Commonalities, however, can be found between humans and nonhuman animals in mating behavior (see [[animal sexual behavior]]).

==Stages of physiological arousal during sexual stimulation==
[[File:Kama sutra 24 detail.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This Indian [[Kama sutra]] illustration, which shows a woman on top of a man, depicts the male erection, which is one of the physiological responses to sexual arousal for men.]]
The [[Human sexual response cycle|physiological responses]] during [[sexual stimulation]] are fairly similar for both men and women and there are four phases.&lt;ref name="Schacter"&gt;{{cite book | authors=Daniel L.

* During the excitement phase, muscle tension and blood flow increase in and around the sexual organs, heart and respiration increase and blood pressure rises. Men and women experience a "[[sex flush]]" on the skin of the upper body and face. Typically, a woman's [[vagina]] becomes lubricated and her [[clitoris]] becomes swollen.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt; A man's penis will become erect.
* During the plateau phase, heart rate and muscle tension increase further. A man's urinary bladder closes to prevent urine from mixing with [[semen]]. A woman's clitoris may withdraw slightly and there is more lubrication, outer swelling and muscles tighten and reduction of diameter.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt;
* During the [[orgasm]] phase, breathing becomes extremely rapid and the pelvic muscles begin a series of rhythmic contractions. Both men and women experience quick cycles of muscle contraction of lower pelvic muscles and women often experience uterine and vaginal contractions; this experience can be described as intensely pleasurable, but roughly 15% of women never experience orgasm and half report having [[Fake orgasm|faked it]].&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt; A large genetic component is associated with how often women experience orgasm.&lt;ref name="Schacter"/&gt;
* During the resolution phase, muscles relax, blood pressure drops, and the body returns to its resting state.

==Psychological aspects==
Sexual activity can lower blood pressure and overall stress levels, regardless of age.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} It serves to release tension, elevate mood, and possibly create a profound sense of relaxation, especially in the postcoital period. From a biochemical perspective, sex causes the release of endorphins and increases levels of white blood cells that actually boost the immune system. A study published in the journal Biological Psychology described how men who had had sex the previous night responded better to stressful situations, it suggested that if a person is regularly sexual, they're regularly relaxed, and when the person is relaxed, they cope better with stressful situations. {{citation needed|date=June 2016}} A 2007 study published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior 36, (no. 3 (June 2007): 357–68) reported that sexual behavior with a partner on one day significantly predicted lower negative mood and stress, and higher positive mood, on the following day.

===Motivations===
{{anchor|Reasons_for_sexual_activity}}
{{Redirect|Pity sex|the American rock band|Pity Sex}}
People engage in sexual activity for any of a multitude of possible reasons. Although the primary evolutionary purpose of sexual activity is reproduction, research on college students suggested that people have sex for four general reasons: ''physical attraction'', as a ''means to an end'', to increase ''emotional connection'', and to ''alleviate insecurity''.&lt;ref&gt;Meston &amp; Buss, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people engage in sexual activity because of pleasure they derive from the [[sexual arousal|arousal of their sexuality]], especially if they can achieve [[orgasm]]. Sexual arousal can also be experienced from [[foreplay]] and flirting, and from [[Fetishism|fetish]] or BDSM activities,&lt;ref name="channel1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120526192917/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1608/is_1_18/ai_80957472 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2012-05-26 | title=Improve your orgasm: you may have thought your sexual pleasure was the one thing that couldn't get any better. Think again&amp;nbsp;— Sexual Fitness&amp;nbsp;— physiology | year=2002 | work=Men's Fitness}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other [[Eroticism|erotic activities]]. Most commonly, people engage in sexual activity because of the [[sexual desire]] generated by a person to whom they feel [[sexual attraction]]; but they may engage in sexual activity for the physical satisfaction they achieve in the absence of attraction for another, as in the case of [[Casual sex|casual or social sex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/casual%20sex|title=Casual sex - Define Casual sex at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At times, a person may engage in a sexual activity solely for the sexual pleasure of their partner, such as because of an obligation they may have to the partner or because of love, sympathy or pity they may feel for the partner.

A person may engage in sexual activity for purely monetary considerations, or to obtain some advantage from either the partner or the activity. A man and woman may engage in sexual intercourse with the objective of [[Fertilisation|conception]]. Some people engage in hate sex, which occurs between two people who strongly dislike or annoy each other. It is related to the idea that opposition between two people can heighten [[sexual tension]], attraction and interest.&lt;ref name=Holbrook1972 &gt;{{Cite book | last=Holbrook | first=David | year=1972 | title=The masks of hate: the problem of false solutions in the culture of an acquisitive society | publisher=Pergamon Press | page=118 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWYIAQAAIAAJ | isbn=978-0-08-015799-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that sexual activity plays a large part in the interaction of social species. [[Joan Roughgarden]], in her book ''Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People,'' postulates that this applies equally to humans as it does to other social species. She explores the purpose of sexual activity and demonstrates that there are many functions facilitated by such activity including pair bonding, group bonding, dispute resolution and reproduction.&lt;ref name=Roughgarden2004 &gt;{{Cite book | last=Roughgarden | first=Joan | year=2004 | title= Diversity, Gender, and Sexuality in Nature and People| publisher=[[University of California Press]] | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dASsUFtN57sC | isbn=978-0-520-24073-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-determination theory===
Research has found that people also engage in sexual activity for reasons associated with [[self-determination theory]]. The self-determination theory can be applied to a sexual relationship when the participants have positive feelings associated with the relationship. These participants do not feel guilty or coerced into the partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Knee C.R. |author2=Lonsbary C. |author3=Canevello A. |author4=Patrick H. | year = 2005 | title = Self-determination and conflict in romantic relationships | url = | journal = J Pers Soc Psychol | volume = 89 | issue = 6| pages = 997–1009 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.89.6.997 |pmid=16393030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have proposed the model of self-determined sexual motivation.  The purpose of this model is to connect self-determination and sexual motivation.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brunell A.B. |author2=Webster G.D. | year = 2013 | title = Self-Determination and Sexual Experience in Dating Relationships | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin | volume = 39 | issue = 7| pages = 970–987 | doi = 10.1177/0146167213485442 |pmid=23613122 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This model has helped to explain how people are sexually motivated when involved in self-determined dating relationships. This model also links the positive outcomes, (satisfying the need for autonomy, competence, and relatedness) gained from sexual motivations.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt;

According to the completed research associated with this model, it was found that people of both sexes who engaged in sexual activity for self-determined motivation had more positive psychological well-being.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; While engaging in sexual activity for self-determined reasons, the participants also had a higher need for fulfillment.  When this need was satisfied, they felt better about themselves. This was correlated with greater closeness to their partner and higher overall satisfaction in their relationship.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; Though both sexes engaged in sexual activity for self-determined reasons, there were some differences found between males and females.  It was concluded that females had more motivation than males to engage in sexual activity for self-determined reasons.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; Females also had higher satisfaction and relationship quality than males did from the sexual activity.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt; Overall, research concluded that psychological well-being, sexual motivation, and sexual satisfaction were all positively correlated when dating couples partook in sexual activity for self-determined reasons.&lt;ref name="Brunell, A.B. 2013"/&gt;

==Frequency==
{{globalize|section|date=June 2015}}
{{See also|Sexually active life expectancy}}
The frequency of sexual activity might range from zero ([[sexual abstinence]]) to 15 or 20 times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=David Osbourne |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sexual-health/HQ01363 |title=Sexual health: An interview with a Mayo Clinic specialist |website=[[Mayo Clinic|MayoClinic.com]] |date=2 December 2004 |accessdate=24 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051206023204/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/sexual-health/HQ01363 |archivedate=6 December 2005 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the average frequency of sexual intercourse for married couples is 2 to 3 times a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction|Kinsey Institute]], the average frequency of sexual intercourse in the US for individuals who have partners is 112 times per year (age 18–29), 86 times per year (age 30–39), and 69 times per year (age 40–49).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html#frequency | title = Frequently asked questions to the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction Kinsey Institute|accessdate = 6 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescents===
{{See also|Adolescent sexuality}}
The age at which adolescents tend to become sexually active varies considerably between different cultures and from time to time. (See [[Virginity#Prevalence of virginity|Prevalence of virginity]].) The first sexual act of a child or adolescent is sometimes referred to as the [[sexualization]] of the child, and may be considered as a milestone or a change of status, as the loss of [[virginity]] or innocence. Youth are legally free to have intercourse after they reach the [[age of consent]].

A 1999 survey of students indicated that approximately 40% of ninth graders across the United States report having had sexual intercourse. This figure rises with each grade. Males are more sexually active than females at each of the grade levels surveyed. Sexual activity of young adolescents differs in ethnicity as well. A higher percent of African American and Hispanic adolescents are sexually active than White adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Meece, Judith L. Child and Adolescent Development for Educators. New York: McGraw Hill, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on sexual frequency has also been conducted solely on female adolescents who engage in sexual activity.  Female adolescents tended to engage in more sexual activity due to positive mood. In female teenagers, engaging in sexual activity was directly positively correlated with being older, greater sexual activity in the previous week or prior day, and more positive mood the previous day or the same day as the sexual activity occurred.&lt;ref name="Fortenberry D.J., Temkit M., Tu W., Graham C.A., Katz B. 2005 252–257"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fortenberry D.J. |author2=Temkit M. |author3=Tu W. |author4=Graham C.A. |author5=Katz B. | year = 2005 | title = Daily Mood, Partner Support, Sexual Interest, and Sexual Activity Among Adolescent Women | url = http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/4803| journal = Health Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = 3| pages = 252–257 | doi = 10.1037/0278-6133.24.3.252 |pmid=15898860 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreased sexual activity was associated with prior or current day negative mood or menstruating.&lt;ref name="Fortenberry D.J., Temkit M., Tu W., Graham C.A., Katz B. 2005 252–257"/&gt;

Although opinions differ, others{{who|date=September 2016}} suggest that sexual activity is an essential part of humans, and that teenagers need to experience sex.  According to a research study, sexual experiences help teenagers understand pleasure and satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Vrangalova, Z. 2011"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vrangalova|first=Zhana|last2=Savin-Williams|first2=Ritch C.|date=1 August 2011|title=Adolescent sexuality and positive well-being: a group-norms approach|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|volume=40|issue=8|pages=931–944|doi=10.1007/s10964-011-9629-7|issn=1573-6601|pmid=21274608}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, it stated that teenagers can positively benefit from sexual activity. The cross-sectional study was conducted in 2008 and 2009 at a rural upstate New York community. Teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 16 revealed a higher well-being than those who were sexually inexperienced or who were first sexually active at a later age of 17.&lt;ref name="Vrangalova, Z. 2011"/&gt; Furthermore, teenagers who had their first sexual experience at age 15 or younger, or who had many sexual partners were not negatively affected and did not have associated lower well-being.&lt;ref name="Vrangalova, Z. 2011"/&gt;

==Health and safety==
Sexual activity is an innately physiological function,&lt;ref&gt;Xiaojun Chen, Xuerui Tan, Qingying Zhang, [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.598.3719  " Cardiovascular effects of sexual activity"], ''Medknow Publications'', December 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but like other physical activity, it comes with risks. There are four main types of risks that may arise from sexual activity: [[Unintended pregnancy|unwanted pregnancy]], contracting a [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infection]] (STI/STD), physical injury, and psychological injury.

===Unwanted pregnancy===
{{main|Unintended pregnancy}}
Any sexual activity that involves the introduction of semen into a woman's vagina, such as during sexual intercourse, or even contact of semen with her vulva, may result in a pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/975.aspx | title=Can I get pregnant if I have sex without penetration? | publisher=[[National Health Service]] | accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce the risk of unintended pregnancies, some people who engage in penile-vaginal sex may use [[birth control|contraception]], such as [[birth control pill]]s, a [[condom]], [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]]s, [[spermicide]]s, [[hormonal contraception]] or sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contraception.about.com/od/contraceptionoverview/g/glossary.htm Dawn Stacey: Contraception. About.com.] Retrieved 11 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of the various contraceptive methods in avoiding pregnancy varies considerably.

===Sexually transmitted infections===
[[File:Préservatif enroulé.jpg|thumb|right|A rolled-up male [[condom]]]]
{{Main|Sexually transmitted infection}}
Sexual activity that involves skin-to-skin contact, exposure to an infected person's [[bodily fluid]]s or [[mucosal membrane]]s&lt;ref&gt;

===Aging===
{{See also|Sexuality in older age}}
Typically, older men and women maintaining interest in sexual interest and activity could be therapeutic; it is a way of expressing their love and care for one another. Factors such as biological and psychological factors, diseases, mental conditions, boredom with the relationship, and widowhood have been found to contribute with the common decrease in sexual interest and activity in old age. National sex surveys given in Finland in the 1990s revealed aging men had a higher incidence of sexual intercourse compared to aging women and that women were more likely to report a lack of sexual desire compared to men. Regression analysis, factors considered important to female sexual activity included: sexual desire, valuing sexuality, and a healthy partner, while high sexual self-esteem, good health, and active sexual history were important to male sexual activity. Both genders in the study agreed they needed good health, good sexual functioning, positive sexual self-esteem, and a sexually skilful partner to maintain sexual desire.&lt;ref&gt;Kontula, O., &amp; Haavio-Mannila, E.

===Heterosexuality===

Heterosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the opposite sex. Heterosexual sexual practices are subject to laws in many places. In some countries, mostly those where religion has a strong influence on [[social policy]], marriage laws serve the purpose of encouraging people to have sex only within marriage. [[Sodomy laws]] were seen as discouraging same-sex sexual practices, but may affect opposite-sex sexual practices. Laws also ban adults from committing [[sexual abuse]], committing sexual acts with anyone under an [[age of consent]], performing sexual activities in public, and engaging in sexual activities for money (prostitution). Though these laws cover both same-sex and opposite-sex sexual activities, they may differ in regard to punishment, and may be more frequently (or exclusively) enforced on those who engage in same-sex sexual activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://criminal.findlaw.com/crimes/more-criminal-topics/sex-offenders/sex-offenses-overview.html Sex Offenders and Sex Offenses: Overview. From FindLaw.] Retrieved 13 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Different-sex sexual practices may be [[monogamy|monogamous]], serially monogamous, or [[Polyamory|polyamorous]], and, depending on the definition of sexual practice, [[abstinence|abstinent]] or [[Autosexuality|autoerotic]] (including [[masturbation]]). Additionally, different religious and political movements have tried to influence or control changes in sexual practices including courting and marriage, though in most countries changes occur at a slow rate.

===Homosexuality===

[[File:An ottoman miniature from the book Sawaqub al-Manaquib depicting Homosexuality.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An Ottoman miniature from the book ''Sawaqub al-Manaquib'' depicting homosexuality]]
Homosexuality is the romantic or sexual attraction to the same sex. People with a homosexual orientation can express their sexuality in a variety of ways, and may or may not express it in their behaviors.&lt;ref name=APAHelp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 |title=Psychology Help Center |publisher=Apahelpcenter.org |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928051520/http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/article.php?id=31 |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research indicates that many gay men and lesbians want, and succeed in having, committed and durable relationships. For example, survey data indicate that between 40% and 60% of gay men and between 45% and 80% of lesbians are currently involved in a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name=WhatIsNature&gt;[http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/orientation.aspx#accordion1_content_11 What is the nature of same-sex relationships?] American Psychological Association, Retrieved 25 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for a person whose sexual identity is mainly heterosexual to engage in sexual acts with people of the same sex. For example, mutual masturbation in the context of what may be considered normal heterosexual teen development. Gay and lesbian people who pretend to be heterosexual are often referred to as being [[closeted]] (hiding their sexuality in "the closet"). "Closet case" is a derogatory term used to refer to people who hide their sexuality. Making that orientation public can be called "[[coming out of the closet]]" in the case of voluntary disclosure or "[[outing]]" in the case of disclosure by others against the subject's wishes (or without their knowledge). Among some communities (called "men on the DL" or "[[Down-low (sexual slang)|down-low]]"), same-sex sexual behavior is sometimes viewed as solely for physical pleasure. [[Men who have sex with men]], as well as [[women who have sex with women]], or men on the "down-low" may engage in sex acts with members of the same sex while continuing sexual and romantic relationships with the opposite sex.

People who engage exclusively in same-sex sexual practices may not identify themselves as gay or lesbian. In sex-segregated environments, individuals may seek relationships with others of their own gender (known as [[situational homosexuality]]). In other cases, some people may experiment or explore their sexuality with same (or different) sex sexual activity before defining their [[sexual identity]]. Despite stereotypes and common misconceptions, there are no forms of sexual acts exclusive to same-sex sexual behavior that cannot also be found in opposite-sex sexual behavior, except those involving the meeting of the genitalia between same-sex partners&amp;nbsp;– [[tribadism]] (generally [[vulva]]-to-vulva rubbing, commonly known by its "scissoring" position) and [[frot]] (generally [[Human penis|penis]]-to-penis rubbing).

===Bisexuality and pansexuality===
{{Main|Bisexuality|Pansexuality}}
People who have a romantic or sexual attraction to both sexes are referred to as bisexual.&lt;ref name="apahelp"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx |title=Sexual Orientation, Homosexuality, and Bisexuality |periodical=[[American Psychological Association|APA]]HelpCenter.org |accessdate=18 September 2012 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Other social aspects==
===General attitudes===

[[Alex Comfort]] and others propose three potential social aspects of sexual intercourse in humans, which are not mutually exclusive: reproductive, relational, and recreational.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking (1972) by [[Alex Comfort]]. See also {{ISBN|1-4000-4614-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|the contraceptive pill]] and other highly effective forms of [[contraception]] in the mid- and late 20th century has increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, which still overlap a great deal and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have intercourse while using contraception to experience sexual pleasure (recreational) and also as a means of emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This same couple may emphasize different aspects of intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Religious and ethical===
{{Main|Sexual morality|Religion and sexuality|Norm (sociology)}}
[[File:Khajuraho-Lakshmana Temple erotic detal1.JPG|thumb|Erotic sculptures found in a medieval [[Khajuraho|Hindu]] temple in India]]
Most world religions have sought to address the moral issues that arise from people's sexuality in society and in human interactions. Each major religion has developed [[moral code]]s covering issues of sexuality, morality, ethics etc. Though these moral codes do not address issues of sexuality directly, they seek to regulate the situations which can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people's sexual activities and practices. However, the effect of religious teaching has at times been limited. For example, though most religions disapprove of [[extramarital sex|extramarital sexual relations]], it has always been widely practiced. Nevertheless, these religious codes have always had a strong influence on peoples' attitudes to issues of modesty in dress, behavior, speech etc.

On the other hand, some people adopt the view that pleasure is its own justification for sexual activity. [[Hedonism]] is a school of thought which argues that pleasure is the only [[intrinsic value (ethics)|intrinsic good]].&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hedonism/ Hedonism], 20 April 2004 ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Human sexual activity, like many other kinds of activity engaged in by humans, is generally influenced by social rules that are culturally specific and vary widely. These social rules are referred to as [[Sexual ethics|sexual morality]] (what can and can not be done by society's rules) and sexual norms (what is and is not expected).

Sexual ethics, morals, and norms relate to issues including deception/honesty, legality, [[fidelity]] and consent. Some activities, known as [[Sex and the law|sex crimes]] in some locations, are illegal in some jurisdictions, including those conducted between (or among) consenting and competent adults (examples include [[sodomy law]] and adult-adult [[incest]]).

Some people who are in a relationship but want to hide polygamous activity (possibly of opposite sexual orientation) from their partner, may solicit consensual sexual activity with others through personal contacts, [[online chat room]]s, or, advertising in select media.

[[Swinging (sexual practice)|Swinging]], on the other hand, involves singles or partners in a [[committed relationship]] engaging in sexual activities with others as a [[recreational sex|recreational]] or social activity.&lt;ref name="case_for_swingers"&gt;{{cite journal

 |volume=3
 |accessdate=24 January 2010
 |url=http://www.ejhs.org/volume3/swing/body.htm}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing popularity of swinging is regarded by some as arising from the upsurge in sexual activity during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s. Swinging sexual activity can take place in a [[sex club]], also known as a swinger club (not to be confused with a [[strip club]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swingingheaven.co.uk/advice/swingers-clubs.html|title=Advice on Swingers' Clubs|publisher=Swinging Heaven|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people engage in various sexual activities as a business transaction. When this involves having sex with, or performing certain actual sexual acts for another person in exchange for money or something of value, it is called prostitution. Other aspects of the [[Sex industry|adult industry]] include [[phone sex]] operators, [[strip club]]s, and pornography.

===Gender roles and the expression of sexuality===
Social [[gender roles]] can influence sexual behavior as well as the reaction of individuals and communities to certain incidents; the [[World Health Organization]] states that, "Sexual violence is also more likely to occur where beliefs in male sexual entitlement are strong, where gender roles are more rigid, and in countries experiencing high rates of other types of violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/summary_en.pdf |title=World report on violence and health – World Health Organization |format=PDF |date=27 August 2002 |author=T.G.V. |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some societies, such as those where the concepts of [[family honor]] and female [[chastity]] are very strong, may practice violent control of female sexuality, through practices such as [[honor killings]] and [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs241/en/|title=WHO – Female genital mutilation|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/|title=BBC – Ethics: Honour Crimes|publisher=|accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relation between [[gender equality]] and sexual expression is recognized, and promotion of equity between men and women is crucial for attaining [[sexual health|sexual]] and [[reproductive health]], as stated by the UN [[International Conference on Population and Development]] Program of Action:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/swp/1997/box9.htm |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070817053022/http://www.unfpa.org/swp/1997/box9.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=17 August 2007 |title=Paragraph 7.34 of the ICPD Programme of Action |work=Sexuality and Gender Relations |accessdate=25 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Human sexuality and gender relations are closely interrelated and together affect the ability of men and women to achieve and maintain sexual health and manage their reproductive lives. Equal relationships between men and women in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the physical integrity of the human body, require mutual respect and willingness to accept responsibility for the consequences of sexual behaviour. Responsible sexual behaviour, sensitivity and equity in gender relations, particularly when instilled during the formative years, enhance and promote respectful and harmonious partnerships between men and women."

==BDSM ==

{{Main|BDSM}}
BDSM is a variety of [[Eroticism|erotic]] practices or [[Sexual roleplay|roleplaying]] involving [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[dominance and submission]], [[sadomasochism]], and other interpersonal dynamics. Given the wide range of practices, some of which may be engaged in by people who do not consider themselves as practicing BDSM, inclusion in the BDSM community or subculture is usually dependent on [[self-identification]] and shared experience. BDSM communities generally welcome anyone with a non-normative streak who identifies with the community; this may include [[cross-dresser]]s, extreme [[body modification]] enthusiasts, [[animal roleplay|animal players]], latex or [[rubber fetishism|rubber aficionados]], and others.

B/D, a form of BDSM, is bondage and discipline. Bondage includes the restraint of the body or mind.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Perks, problems, and the people who play: A qualitative exploration of dominant and submissive BDSM roles|journal = The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality|date = 1 January 2015|volume = 24|issue = 1|doi = 10.3138/cjhs.2467|first = Ali|last = Hébert|first2 = Angela|last2 = Weaver|pages=49–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; D/S means "dominant and submissive." A dominant is someone who takes control of someone who wishes to give up control. A submissive is someone who gives up the control to a person who wishes to take control.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; S/M (sadism and masochism) means an individual who takes pleasure in the humiliation or pain of others. Masochism means an individual who takes pleasure from their own pain or humiliation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Unlike the usual "power neutral" relationships and play styles commonly followed by couples, activities and relationships within a BDSM context are often characterized by the participants' taking on complementary, but unequal roles; thus, the idea of [[informed consent]] of both the partners becomes essential. Participants who exert sexual dominance over their partners are known as dominants or [[Top (BDSM)|tops]], while participants who take the passive, receiving, or obedient role are known as submissives or [[bottom (BDSM)|bottoms]].

Individuals are also sometimes abbreviated when referred to in writing, so a dominant person may be referred to as a "dom" for a man or a woman.  Sometimes a woman may choose to use the female specific term "Domme".  Both terms are pronounced the same when spoken.  Individuals who can change between top/dominant and bottom/submissive roles—whether from relationship to relationship or within a given relationship—are known as ''switches''. The precise definition of roles and self-identification is a common subject of debate within the community.&lt;ref name="Terms"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grau|first=Johnson|url=http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm|title=What do B&amp;D, S&amp;M, D&amp;S, "top", "bottom" mean|publisher=Leather Roses|date=1995|accessdate=27 January 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080111223259/http://www.leathernroses.com/generalbdsm/ssbbfaqdefines.htm| archivedate= 11 January 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Submissivepup.jpg|thumb]]
In a 2013 study, the researchers state that BDSM is a sexual act where they play role games, use restraint, use power exchange,
use suppression and pain is sometimes involved depending on individual(s).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Psychological Characteristics of BDSM Practitioners|journal = The Journal of Sexual Medicine|date = 1 January 2013|volume = 10|issue = 8|doi = 10.1111/jsm.12192|pmid = 23679066|first = Andreas A.J.|last = Wismeijer|first2 = Marcel A.L.M. van|last2 = Assen|pages=1943–1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study serves to challenge the widespread notion that BDSM could be in some way linked to [[psychopathology]]. According to the findings, one who participates in BDSM may have greater strength socially and mentally as well as greater independence than those who do not practice BDSM.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It suggests that people who participate in BDSM play have higher subjective well-being, and that this might be due to the fact that BDSM play requires extensive communication. Before any sexual act occurs, the partners must discuss their agreement of their relationship. They discuss how long the play will last, the intensity, their actions, what each participant needs or desires. The sexual acts are all recorded as consensual and pleasurable to both parties.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In a 2015 study, interviewed BDSM participants have mentioned that the activities have helped to create higher levels of connection, intimacy, trust and communication between partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The study suggests that dominants and submissives exchange control for each other's pleasure and to satisfy a need. The participants have remarked that they enjoy pleasing their partner in any way they can and many surveyed have felt that this is one of the best things about BDSM. It gives a submissive pleasure to do things in general for their dominant. Where a Dominant enjoys making their encounters all about the submissive. They enjoy doing things that makes their submissive happy. The findings indicate that the surveyed submissives and dominants found BDSM play more pleasurable and fun. The participants have also mentioned improvements in their personal growth, romantic relationships, sense of community and self, the dominant's confidence, and their coping with everyday things by giving them a psychological release.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Legal issues==
{{Main|Sex and the law}}
There are many laws and social customs which prohibit, or in some way affect sexual activities. These laws and customs vary from country to country, and have varied over time. They cover, for example, a prohibition to non-consensual sex, to sex outside marriage, to sexual activity in public, besides many others. Many of these restrictions are non-controversial, but some have been the subject of public debate.

Most societies consider it a serious crime to force someone to engage in sexual acts or to engage in sexual activity with someone who does not consent. This is called [[sexual assault]], and if sexual penetration occurs it is called rape, the most serious kind of sexual assault. The details of this distinction may vary among different legal jurisdictions. Also, what constitutes effective consent in sexual matters varies from culture to culture and is frequently debated. Laws regulating the minimum age at which a person can consent to have sex ([[age of consent]]) are frequently the subject of debate, as is [[adolescent sexual behavior]] in general. Some societies have forced marriage, where consent may not be required.

===Same-sex laws===
{{Main|LGBT rights by country or territory}}
Many locales have laws that limit or prohibit [[Same-sex relationship|same-sex sexual activity]].

===Sex outside marriage===

Other studies have analyzed the changing attitudes about sex that American adolescents have outside marriage.  Adolescents were asked how they felt about oral and vaginal sex in relation to their health, social, and emotional well-being.  Overall, teenagers felt that oral sex was viewed as more socially positive amongst their demographic.&lt;ref name="Halpern-Feisher, B.L. 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Halpern-Feisher B.L. |author2=Cornell J.L. |author3=Kropp R.Y. |author4=Tschann J.M. | year = 2005 | title = Oral Versus Vaginal Sex Among Adolescents: Perceptions, Attitudes, and Behaviour | url = | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 115 | issue = 4| pages = 845–851 | doi = 10.1542/peds.204-2108 |doi-broken-date=2018-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results stated that teenagers believed that oral sex for dating and non-dating adolescents was less threatening to their overall values and beliefs than vaginal sex was.&lt;ref name="Halpern-Feisher, B.L. 2005"/&gt; When asked, teenagers who participated in the research viewed oral sex as more acceptable to their peers, and their personal values than vaginal sex.&lt;ref name="Halpern-Feisher, B.L. 2005"/&gt;

===Minimum age of sexual activity (age of consent)===
{{Main|Age of consent}}
The laws of each jurisdiction set the minimum age at which a young person is allowed to engage in sexual activity.&lt;ref name="waites"&gt;{{cite book|last=Waites| first = Matthew|title=The Age of Consent: Young People, Sexuality and Citizenship|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2005|isbn= 978-1-4039-2173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[age of consent]] is typically between 14 and 18 years, but laws vary. In many jurisdictions, age of consent is a person's mental or functional age.&lt;ref name="kopple-wolf1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html |title=Kopple-Wolf.com |publisher=Kopple-Wolf.com |accessdate=30 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605002946/http://www.kopple-wolf.com/lawyer-attorney-1139001.html |archivedate=5 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kopple-wolf1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="supremecourt1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/jurisprudence/1999/apr99/126545.htm |title=People vs Floers: 126545: April 21, 1999: J.

Age of consent may vary by the type of sexual act, the sex of the actors, or other restrictions such as abuse of a [[position of trust]]. Some jurisdictions also make allowances for young people engaged in sexual acts with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/canada-s-age-of-consent-raised-by-2-years-1.754941|title=Canada's age of consent raised by 2 years|publisher=CBC News|date=1 May 2008|accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incestuous relationships===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2018}}

Most jurisdictions prohibit sexual activity between certain close relatives. These laws vary to some extent; such acts are called [[incest]]uous.

===Sexual abuse===
{{Main|Sexual abuse|Rape|Sexual assault}}

Non-consensual sexual activity or subjecting an unwilling person to witnessing a sexual activity are forms of [[sexual abuse]], as well as (in many countries) certain non-consensual paraphilias such as [[frotteurism]], [[telephone scatophilia]] (indecent phonecalls), and non-consensual [[exhibitionism]] and [[voyeurism]] (known as "[[indecent exposure]]" and "[[Voyeurism|peeping tom]]" respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lawrence Greenfeld |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/SOO.PDF |format=PDF |title=Sex Offenses and Offenders |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |date=6 February 1997 |accessdate=25 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution and survival sex===
{{main|Prostitution}}
People sometimes exchange sex for money or access to other resources. This practice, called prostitution, takes place under many varied circumstances. The person who receives payment for sexual services is called a prostitute and the person who receives such services is known by a multitude of terms, including (and most commonly) "john." Prostitution is one of the branches of the [[sex industry]]. The [[prostitution and the law|legal status of prostitution]] varies from [[Prostitution by country|country to country]], from being a punishable crime to a regulated profession. Estimates place the annual revenue generated from the global prostitution industry to be over $100&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.havocscope.com/activities/prostitution/| title= Prostitution Market Value| accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution is sometimes referred to as "the world's oldest profession".&lt;ref&gt;The prostitution of women and girls – Page 5; Ronald B. Flowers – 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution may be a voluntary individual activity or facilitated or [[forced prostitution|forced]] by [[pimp]]s.

[[Survival sex]] is a form of prostitution engaged in by people in need, usually when [[homeless]] or otherwise disadvantaged people trade sex for food, a place to sleep, or other [[basic needs]], or for [[Recreational drug use|drugs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flowers|first=R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3470">The '''Hume-Rothery rules''', named after [[William Hume-Rothery]], are a set of basic rules that describe the conditions under which an element could dissolve in a [[metal]], forming a [[solid solution]].  There are two sets of rules; one refers to substitutional solid solutions, and the other refers to [[Interstitial defect|interstitial]] solid solutions.

==Substitutional solid solution rules==
For substitutional solid solutions, the Hume-Rothery rules are as follows:

# The [[atomic radius]] of the solute and [[solvent]] atoms must differ by no more than 15%:
#:&lt;math&gt; \% \mbox{ difference} = \left ( \frac{r_{solute} - r_{solvent}}{r_{solvent}} \right ) \times 100\% \le 15\%.&lt;/math&gt;
# The [[crystal structure]]s of solute and solvent must be similar.
# Complete [[solubility]] occurs when the solvent and solute have the same [[Valence (chemistry)|valency]].&lt;ref&gt;''Foundations of Materials Science and Engineering'', 4th ed., W. Smith and J. Hashemi, pp.139-140 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;   A metal of higher valency is more likely to dissolve in a metal with lower valency.&lt;ref&gt;VALENCY  EFFECTS AND  RELATIVE SOLUBILITIES IN  TRANSITION METAL ALLOYS D.

It appears more easily-obtainable 2ndary sources say lower is likelier to dissolve in higher than this.  Two independent 2ndary sources are needed to leave this statement as is.  References in talk page.|date=January 2018}}
# The solute and solvent should have similar [[electronegativity]]. If the electronegativity difference is too great, the metals tend to form [[Intermetallics|intermetallic compounds]] instead of solid solutions.

==Interstitial solid solution rules==
For [[Interstitial defect|interstitial]] solid solutions, the Hume-Rothery rules are:

# Solute atoms should have radius no larger than 59% of the radius of solvent atoms.&lt;ref&gt;https://madeeasy.in/admin/ESEGroup/12.%20ME_ESE_FST_Paper-2_Conv_2109.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://slideplayer.com/slide/7666224/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://slideplayer.com/slide/5866092/&lt;/ref&gt;
# The solute and solvent should have similar [[electronegativity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Hume-Rothery Rules  | encyclopedia = Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# They should show a wide range of composition.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} {{confusing | section | reason = this statement is either circular, or contradictory, or incomprehensible. |date=January 2018}}
# Valency factor: two elements should have the same valence. The greater the difference in valence between solute and solvent atoms, the lower the solubility.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4351">In [[finance]], '''indifference pricing''' is a method of pricing [[financial securities]] with regard to a [[utility function]].  The ''' indifference price''' is also known as the '''[[reservation price]]''' or '''private valuation'''.  In particular, the indifference price is the price at which an agent would have the same [[expected utility]] level by exercising a [[financial transaction]] as by not doing so (with optimal trading otherwise).  Typically the indifference price is a pricing range (a [[bid-ask spread]]) for a specific agent; this price range is an example of [[good-deal bounds]].&lt;ref name="FE"&gt;{{cite book|title=Financial Engineering|author=John R. Birge|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|pages=521–524|isbn=978-0-444-51781-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematics==
Given a utility function &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; and a claim &lt;math&gt;C_T&lt;/math&gt; with known payoffs at some terminal time &lt;math&gt;T,&lt;/math&gt; let the function &lt;math&gt;V: \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; be defined by
: &lt;math&gt;V(x,k) = \sup_{X_T \in \mathcal{A}(x)} \mathbb{E}\left[u\left(X_T + k C_T\right)\right]&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the initial endowment, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all [[self-financing portfolio]]s at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; starting with endowment &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the number of the claim to be purchased (or sold).  Then the indifference bid price &lt;math&gt;v^b(k)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; units of &lt;math&gt;C_T&lt;/math&gt; is the solution of &lt;math&gt;V(x - v^b(k),k) = V(x,0)&lt;/math&gt; and the indifference ask price &lt;math&gt;v^a(k)&lt;/math&gt; is the solution of &lt;math&gt;V(x + v^a(k),-k) = V(x,0)&lt;/math&gt;.  The indifference price bound is the range &lt;math&gt;\left[v^b(k),v^a(k)\right]&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=C09&gt;{{cite book|first=Rene|last=Carmona|title=Indifference Pricing: Theory and Applications|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-691-13883-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
Consider a market with a risk free asset &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;B_0 = 100&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_T = 110&lt;/math&gt;, and a risky asset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;S_0 = 100&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_T \in \{90, 110, 130\}&lt;/math&gt; each with probability &lt;math&gt;1/3&lt;/math&gt;.  Let your utility function be given by &lt;math&gt;u(x) = 1 - \exp(-x/10)&lt;/math&gt;.  To find either the bid or ask indifference price for a single European call option with strike 110, first calculate &lt;math&gt;V(x,0)&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;V(x,0) = \max_{\alpha B_0 + \beta S_0 = x} \mathbb{E}[1 - \exp(-.1 \times (\alpha B_T + \beta S_T))]&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = \max_{\beta} \left[1 - \frac{1}{3} \left[\exp\left(-\frac{1.10 x - 20 \beta}{10}\right) + \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 x}{10}\right) + \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 x + 20 \beta}{10}\right)\right]\right]&lt;/math&gt;.
Which is maximized when &lt;math&gt;\beta = 0&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;V(x,0) = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 x}{10}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Now to find the indifference bid price solve for &lt;math&gt;V(x - v^b(1),1)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;V(x - v^b(1),1) = \max_{\alpha B_0 + \beta S_0 = x - v^b(1)} \mathbb{E}[1 - \exp(-.1 \times (\alpha B_T + \beta S_T + C_T))]&lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt; = \max_{\beta} \left[1 - \frac{1}{3}\left[\exp\left(-\frac{1.10 (x - v^b(1)) - 20 \beta}{10}\right) + \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 (x - v^b(1))}{10}\right) + \exp\left(-\frac{1.10 (x - v^b(1)) + 20 \beta + 20}{10}\right)\right]\right]&lt;/math&gt;
Which is maximized when &lt;math&gt;\beta = -\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt;V(x - v^b(1),1) = 1 - \frac{1}{3} \exp(-1.10 x/10) \exp(1.10 v^b(1)/10)\left[1 + 2 \exp(-1)\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore &lt;math&gt;V(x,0) = V(x - v^b(1),1)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;v^b(1) = \frac{10}{1.1} \log\left(\frac{3}{1+2 \exp(-1)}\right) \approx 4.97&lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly solve for &lt;math&gt;v^a(1)&lt;/math&gt; to find the indifference ask price.

==Notes==
* If &lt;math&gt;\left[v^b(k),v^a(k)\right]&lt;/math&gt; are the indifference price bounds for a claim then by definition &lt;math&gt;v^b(k) = -v^a(-k)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=C09 /&gt;
* If &lt;math&gt;v(k)&lt;/math&gt; is the indifference bid price for a claim and &lt;math&gt;v^{sup}(k),v^{sub}(k)&lt;/math&gt; are the [[superhedging price]] and subhedging prices respectively then &lt;math&gt;v^{sub}(k) \leq v(k) \leq v^{sup}(k)&lt;/math&gt;.  Therefore, in a [[complete market]] the indifference price is always equal to the price to hedge the claim.

[[File:Alif Laam Meem Muslim Fraternity At Domestic Violence Rally.JPG|thumb|On March 23, 2013, members of [[Alpha Lambda Mu|Alif Laam Meem]], a national Muslim fraternity based at the University of Texas at Dallas, stood up against domestic violence as Muslims and as men of Dallas.]]
The relationship between '''Islam and domestic violence''' is disputed. Even among Muslims, the uses and interpretations of [[sharia]], the moral code and religious law of Islam, lack [[consensus]].

Conservative {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} interpretations of [[Surah]] [[An-Nisa, 34]] in the [[Qur'an]] regarding marital relationships find that hitting a woman is allowed.  Other interpretations of the verse claim it does not support hitting a woman, but separating from her. Variations in interpretation are due to different schools of Islamic [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]], histories and politics of religious institutions, conversions, [[reforms]], and education.&lt;ref name=Hajjar&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hajjar | first1 = Lisa | year = 2004 | title = Religion, State Power, and Domestic Violence in Muslim Societies: A Framework for Comparative Analysis | url = | journal = Law and Social Inquiry | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 1–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestic violence among the Muslim community is considered a complicated [[human rights]] issue due to varying legal remedies for women by the nations in which they live, the extent to which they have support or opportunities to divorce their husbands, cultural stigma to hide evidence of abuse, and inability to have abuse recognized by police or the judicial system in some Muslim nations.

== Definition ==
{{further|Domestic violence}}

According to the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition, domestic violence is: "the inflicting of physical injury by one family or household member on another; also: a repeated or habitual pattern of such behavior."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/domestic%20violence ''Domestic Violence.''] Merriam Webster. Retrieved 14 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coomaraswamy defines domestic violence as "violence that occurs within the private sphere, generally between individuals who are related through intimacy, blood or law…[It is] nearly always a gender-specific crime, perpetrated by men against women." It used is as a strong form of control and oppression.&lt;ref name=Coomaraswamy&gt;Coomaraswamy, Radhika.

Retrieved 19 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kofi Annan]], former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], declared in a 2006 report posted on the [[United Nations Development Fund for Women]] (UNIFEM) website that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Violence against women and girls is a problem of [[pandemic]] proportions. At least one out of every three women around the world has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in her lifetime with the abuser usually someone known to her.&lt;ref name=Moradian&gt;Moradian, Azad.

[[Surah]] [[An-Nisa, 34]]-35 passage on the [[social interaction]] between husbands and wives defines the husband and wife relationship in [[Islam]], with interpretation subject to debate among Muslim scholars (or 'jurists'). Quran 4:34 reads,
{{quote|
Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allah has given the one more (strength) than the other, and because they support them from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient, and guard in (the husband's) absence what Allah would have them guard. As to those women on whose part ye fear disloyalty and ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (Next), refuse to share their beds, (And last) strike them (lightly); but if they return to obedience, seek not against them Means (of annoyance): For Allah is Most High, great (above you all). If ye fear a breach between them twain, appoint (two) arbiters, one from his family, and the other from hers; if they wish for peace, Allah will cause their reconciliation: For Allah hath full knowledge, and is acquainted with all things|{{cite quran|4|34-35|t=y|s=ns}} }}

Various translations of the above passage read 'strike them' or 'beat them' or 'scourge them', depending on the translator.

=== In Hadith ===

{{quotation|Narrated 'Ikrima: Rifa'a divorced his wife whereupon 'AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi married her. 'Aisha said that the lady (came), wearing a green veil. It was the habit of ladies to support each other, so when Allah's Apostle came, 'Aisha said, "I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women. Look! Her skin is greener than her clothes!" When 'AbdurRahman heard that his wife had gone to the Prophet, he came with his two sons from another wife. She said, "By Allah! I have done no wrong to him but he is impotent and is as useless to me as this," holding and showing the fringe of her garment, 'Abdur-Rahman said, "By Allah, O Allah's Apostle! She has told a lie! I am very strong and can satisfy her but she is disobedient and wants to go back to Rifa'a." Allah's Apostle said, to her, "If that is your intention, then know that it is unlawful for you to remarry Rifa'a unless Abdur-Rahman has had sexual intercourse with you." Then the Prophet saw two boys with 'Abdur-Rahman and asked (him), "Are these your sons?" On that 'AbdurRahman said, "Yes." The Prophet said, "You claim what you claim (i.e.. that he is impotent)? But by Allah, these boys resemble him as a crow resembles a crow,"|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|72|715}} see also {{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|4|2127}}}}

{{quotation|Narrated 'Abdullah bin Sam'a The Prophet said, "None of you should flog his wife as he flogs a slave and then have sexual intercourse with her in the last part of the day."|{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|62|132}} see also {{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|73|68}} }}

{{quote|It was narrated that Sulayman bin Amr bin Ahwas said: “My father told me that he was present at the Farewell Pilgrimage with the Messenger of God. He praised and glorified God, and reminded and exhorted (the people). Then he said: 'I enjoin good treatment of women, for they are helpers of you, and you have no right to treat them otherwise, unless they commit lewdness. If they do that, then forsake them in their beds and hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark. If they obey you, then do not seek means of annoyance against them. You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they are not to allow anyone whom you dislike to tread on your bedding, nor allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses. And their right over you are that you should treat them kindly with regard to their clothing and food.' ” (sunan ibn Majah vol. 3 book. 9 Hadith 1851) &lt;ref&gt; (sunao ibn Majah vol.3 book 9 Hadith 1851) &lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Interpretations that support domestic violence ===
Hajjar LisA&lt;ref&gt;Hajjar, Lisa. "Religion, state power, and domestic violence in Muslim societies: A framework for comparative analysis." Law &amp; Social Inquiry 29.1 (2004); see pages 1-38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Treacher, Amal. "Reading the Other Women, Feminism, and Islam." Studies in Gender and Sexuality 4.1 (2003); pages 59-71&lt;/ref&gt;{{year needed|date=February 2018}} claims Shari'a law encourages "domestic violence" against women, when a husband suspects ''[[nushuz]]'' (disobedience, disloyalty, rebellion, ill conduct) in his wife.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Raines &amp; Daniel C. Maguire (Ed), Farid Esack,  What Men Owe to Women: Men's Voices from World Religions, State University of New York (2001), see pages 201-203&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars claim wife beating, for ''nashizah'', is not consistent with modern perspectives of Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Nicky Ali, ed. Encyclopedia of domestic violence. CRC Press, 2007. (see chapter on Qur'anic perspectives on wife abuse)&lt;/ref&gt; Some conservative translations find that Muslim husbands are permitted to act what is known in [[Arabic]] as Idribuhunna with the use of "light force," and sometimes as much as to strike, hit, chastise, or beat.&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;Ahmed, Ali S. V.; Jibouri, Yasin T. (2004). ''The Koran: Translation.'' Elmhurst, NY: Tahrike Tarsile Qurʼān. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[Tafsir|exegesis]] such as those of [[Ibn Kathir]](1300-1373AD) and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]](839-923AD), the actions prescribed in Surah 4:34 above, are to be taken in sequence: the husband is to admonish the wife, after which (if his previous correction was unsuccessful) he may remain separate from her, after which (if his previous correction was still unsuccessful) he may hit her&lt;ref name=Makarem&gt;[http://www.al-ijtihaad.com/ulema-e-islam/ulema_10.html ''Grand Ayatullah Nasir Makarem Shirazi: Fatwas and viewpoints.''] Al-Ijtihaad Foundation.

{{refn|[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali]] in his Quranic commentary states that: "In case of family jars four steps are mentioned, to be taken in that order. (1) Perhaps verbal advice or admonition may be sufficient; (2) if not, sex relations may be suspended; (3) if this is not sufficient, some slight physical correction may be administered; but Imam Shafi'i considers this inadvisable, though permissible, and all authorities are unanimous in deprecating any sort of cruelty, even of the nagging kind, as mentioned in the next clause; (4) if all this fails, a family council is recommended in passage 4:35."&lt;ref name=Ali&gt;[[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Ali, Abdullah Yusuf]], (1989) ''The Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary.''

If this is not helpful, he should sleep apart from her, trying to awaken her agreeable feminine nature so that serenity may be restored, and she may respond to him in a harmonious fashion. If this approach fails, it is permissible for him to beat her lightly with his hands, avoiding her face and other sensitive parts."&lt;ref name=Yusuf&gt;{{cite book |author=Yusuf al-Qaradawi |title=The Lawful and the Prohibited in Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iXCNAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA227source%3Dbl&amp;ots=U5EOq-_JBX&amp;pg=PA227#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |page=227 |location=Kuala Lumpur |publisher=Islamic Book Trust |year=2013 |isbn=978-967-0526-00-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} or give her a light tapping.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Kathir]], "Tafsir of Ibn Kathir", Al-Firdous Ltd., London, 2000, 50-53&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Egyptian scholar Abd al-Halim Abu Shaqqa refers to the opinions of jurists [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]](1372-1449AD) and [[Shawkani|al-Shawkani]](1759-1839AD) who state that hitting should only occur in extraordinary cases.&lt;ref name="Roald 2001 p. 169"&gt;Roald (2001) p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

A translated passage by [[Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali|Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali]] and [[Muhammad Muhsin Khan|Muhsin Khan]] in 2007 defines men as the protectors, guardians and maintainers of women, because [[Allah]] has made the one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means.  Upon seeing ill-conduct (i.e. [[disobedience]], [[rebellion]], nashuz in Arabic) by his wife, a man may [[admonish]] them (first), (next), refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them (lightly, if it is useful), but if they return to obedience, seek not against them means.&lt;ref&gt;Khan, Muhammad Muhsin; Hilālī, Taqī Al-Dīn.

=== Interpretation that does not support hitting ===
Indicating the subjective nature of the translations, particularly regarding domestic abuse, [[Ahmad Ali|Ahmed Ali]]'s English translation of the word ''idribu'' is "to forsake, avoid, or leave."{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}  His English translation of verse 4:34 is:
…As for women you feel are averse, talk to them cursively; then leave them alone in bed (without molesting them), and go to bed with them (when they are willing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irebd.com/quran/english/surah-4/verse-34/|title=Quran Surah An-Nisaa ( Verse 34 ) with English Translation الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاءِ بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللَّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَىٰ بَعْضٍ وَبِمَا أَنْفَقُوا مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ ۚ فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللَّهُ ۚ وَاللَّاتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ وَاهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِي الْمَضَاجِعِ وَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ ۖ فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلَا تَبْغُوا عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلًا ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيًّا كَبِيرًا|website=IReBD.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in his native Urdu translation of verse 4:34, he translates ''idribuhunna'' as "beat them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ali|first1=Ahmed|title=34 القرآن, النساء|url=http://tanzil.net/#trans/ur.ahmedali/4:34|website=Tanzil.net|page=84|language=Urdu|quote=مرد عورتوں پر حاکم ہیں اس واسطے کہ الله نے ایک کو ایک پر فضیلت دی ہے اور اس واسطے کہ انہوں نے اپنے مال خرچ کیے ہیں پھر جو عورتیں نیک ہیں وہ تابعدار ہیں مردوں کے پیٹھ پیچھے الله کی نگرانی میں (ان کے حقوق کی) حفاظت کرتی ہیں اور جن عورتو ں سےتمہیں سرکشی کا خطرہ ہو تو انہیں سمجھاؤ اور سونے میں جدا کر دو اور مارو پھر اگر تمہارا کہا مان جائیں تو ان پر الزام لگانے کے لیے بہانے مت تلاش کرو بے شک الله سب سے اوپر بڑا ہے (34)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Laleh Bakhtiar found out by reading Edward William Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon, a 3,064-page volume from the 19th century, among the six pages of definitions for ''daraba'' one definition was "to go away."&lt;ref name=Bakhtiar&gt;Bakhtiar, Laleh.
[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/world/americas/25iht-koran.4.5017346.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all ''Verse in Koran on beating wife gets a new translation.''] NYTimes.com&lt;/ref&gt; This translation is further supported by the fact that the word ''darabtum'', which means to "go abroad" in the sake of Allah, is used in the same Surah (in 4:94) and is derived from
the same root word (''daraba'') as ''idribuhunna'' in 4:34.&lt;ref name=4:94&gt;Unknown author.
[http://www.islamawareness.net/Wife/beating1.html ''Systematic comparison with 4:94''] Islamawareness.net&lt;/ref&gt; This translation is negated however by the fact that most definitions of ''daraba'' in Edward William Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon are related to physical beating&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=William Lane |first1=Edward |title=Arabic-English Lexicon by Edward William Lane  (London: Willams &amp; Norgate 1863) |url=http://www.tyndalearchive.com/TABS/Lane/ |pages=1777–1783 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150408021742/http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/lane/ |archivedate=2015-04-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that when the root word ''daraba'' and its derivatives are used in the Qur'an in relation to humans or their body parts, it exclusively means physically beating or striking them (e.g. in [http://quran.com/2/73 Qur'an 2:73][http://quran.com/37/93 37:93], [http://quran.com/8/12 8:12], [http://quran.com/8/50 8:50], [http://quran.com/47/4 47:4] and [http://quran.com/47/27 47:27]).

In a certain hadidth, Muhammad discouraged beating one's wife severely:

Bahz bin Hakim reported on the authority of his father from his grandfather (Mu'awiyah ibn Haydah) as saying:
"I said: Messenger of Allah, how should we approach our wives and how should we leave them? He replied: Approach your [http://quran.com/2/223 tilth] when or how you will, give her (your wife) food when you take food, clothe when you clothe yourself, do not revile her face, and do not beat her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunan Abi Dawud, Book 11, Hadith 2138|url=http://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/98}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newageislam.com/islam,-women-and-feminism/does-islam-allow-wife-beating?/d/7244|title=Does Islam Allow Wife-Beating?, Islam, Women and Feminism, Aiman Reyaz, New Age Islam, New Age Islam|work=newageislam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same hadith has been narrated with slightly different wording.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunan Abi Dawud, Book 11, Hadith 2139|url=http://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/99|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other versions of this hadith, only beating the face is discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Al-Baghawi|authorlink1=Al-Baghawi|title=Mishkat Al-Masabih|volume=2|page=691}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunan Abi Dawud, Book 11, Hadith 2137|url=http://sunnah.com/abudawud/12/97|website=Sunnah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some jurists argue that even when beating is acceptable under the Quran, it is still discouraged.{{refn|[[Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]] comments that "Whenever the Prophet permitted a man to administer corporal punishment to his wife, he did so with reluctance, and continued to express his distaste for it. And even in cases where it is necessary, the Prophet directed men not to hit across the face, nor to beat severely nor to use anything that might leave marks on the body."

The narration continues, stating that some while after the edict, "Umar complained to the Messenger of God that many women turned against their husbands. Muhammad gave his permission that the men could hit their wives in cases of rebelliousness. The women then turned to the wives of the Prophet and complained about their husbands. The Prophet said: 'Many women have turned to my family complaining about their husbands. Verily, these men are not among the best of you."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Kathir 1981 vol I: 386, Sunan Abi Dawud, Book of Marriage #1834, ad-Darimi, Book of Marriage #2122; quoted in Roald (2001) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan A.C. Brown]] throws light on the general trend when it comes to the verse:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The vast majority of the ulama across the Sunni schools of law inherited the Prophet's unease over domestic violence and placed further restrictions on the evident meaning of the 'Wife Beating Verse'. A leading Meccan scholar from the second generation of Muslims, [[Ata ibn Abi Rabah|Ata' bin Abi Rabah]], counseled a husband not to beat his wife even if she ignored him but rather to express his anger in some other way. [[Al-Darimi|Darimi]], a teacher of both [[Tirmidhi]] and [[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Muslim bin Hajjaj]] as well as a leading early scholar in Iran, collected all the Hadiths showing Muhammad's disapproval of beating in a chapter entitled 'The Prohibition on Striking Women'. A thirteenth-century scholar from Granada, Ibn Faras, notes that one camp of ulama had staked out a stance forbidding striking a wife altogether, declaring it contrary to the Prophet's example and denying the authenticity of any Hadiths that seemed to permit beating. Even [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajar]], the pillar of late medieval Sunni Hadith scholarship, concludes that, contrary to what seems to be an explicit command in the Qur'an, the Hadiths of the Prophet leave no doubt that striking one's wife to discipline her actually falls under the Shariah ruling of 'strongly disliked' or 'disliked verging on prohibited'.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C.

In Iran the nature of domestic violence is complicated by both a national culture and authoritative state that support control, oppression and violence against women.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;

A [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) study in [[Babol]] found that within the previous year 15.0% of wives had been physically abused, 42.4% had been sexually abused and 81.5% had been psychologically abused (to various degrees) by their husbands, blaming low income, young age, unemployment and low education.&lt;ref&gt;Faramarzi, M. et al.

In 2004 a study of domestic violence was undertaken by the Women's Center for Presidential Advisory,  [[Ministry of Science, Research and Technology (Iran)|Ministry of Higher Education]] and  [[Ministry of Interior (Iran)|The Interior Ministry]] of capital cities in Iran's 28 provinces. 66% married women in Iran are subjected to some kind of domestic violence in the first year of their marriage, either by their husbands or by their in-laws. All married women who were participants in this study in Iran have experienced 7.4% of the 9 categories of abuse. The likelihood of being subject to violence varied: The more children in a family or the more rural the family lived, the greater the likelihood of domestic violence; Educated and career women were less likely to be victims of abuse.  9.63% of women in the study reported wishing their husbands would die, as a result of the abuse they have experienced.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;

Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, laws against domestic violence, as well as whether these laws are enforced, vary throughout the Muslim world.

Some women want to fight the abuses they face as Muslims; these women want "to retain the communal extended family aspects of traditional society, while eliminating its worst abuses, by seeking easy ability to divorce men for abuse and forced marriages."&lt;ref name=Ask47&gt;Ask, Karin; Marit Tjomsland.

| [[Iran]]

| Existing laws (Iranian Code of Criminal Procedure articles 42, 43, 66) intend to prohibit violence in the form of kidnapping, gender-based harassment, abuse of pregnant women and "crimes against rights and responsibilities within the family structure," but due to cultural and political culture do not protect women, prosecute their abusers and provide services to victims.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;&lt;ref name=JIRI&gt;[http://en.humanrights-iran.ir/news-18220.aspx ''Iran enforces laws on prevention of violence against women: Iranian MP''] Judiciary of the Islamic Republic of Iran, High Council For Human Rights. 16 Sep. 2011. Retrieve 15 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The government has laws that support violence against women in the case of adultery, including flogging, imprisonment and death.&lt;ref name=Moradian/&gt;

Laws to better enforce existing laws and protect women against violence were placed before the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|Iranian parliament]] the week ending 16 September 2011, focusing on both protection and prevention of violence against women, including focus on human trafficking, better protection and services for abuse victims, rehabilitation (especially concerning domestic abuse) and better processes to manage questioning of female offenders.  One of the keys to ultimate success is altering community cultural views regarding the use of violence against women.&lt;ref name=JIRI/&gt;

| [[Morocco]]
| In 1993 as a response to the women's rights activism against aspects of [[Morocco|Moroccan]] family law that are discriminatory or otherwise harmful to women, King Hassan II had instituted some modest reforms of the Mudawwana, and in 1998, he authorized Prime Minister El-Yousoufi to propose further changes. When the King Hassan died in 1999, the throne passed to his son, Muhammad VI, who committed to bolder reforms to improve the status of women.&lt;ref name=Euben/&gt; Opponents of the plan argued that this reform conflicted with women's duties to their husbands and contravene  their sharia-based status as legal minors. However, the controversy marked by the huge competing demonstrations intimidated the government, which led to the withdrawal of the plan.

== Victim support programs ==
In Malaysia, the largest government-run hospital implemented a program to intervene in cases where domestic violence seems possible.  The woman is brought to a room to meet with a counselor who works with the patient to determine if the woman is in danger and should be transferred to a shelter for safety.  If the woman does not wish to go to the shelter, she is encouraged to see a social worker and file a police report.  If the injury is very serious, investigations begin immediately.&lt;ref name=UN92&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.aspsymbol=A/61/122/Add.1 ''In-depth study on all forms of violence against women.''] United Nations, General Assembly.  6 July 2006.

== Divorce ==
{{See also|Divorce (Islamic)}}

Though some Muslim scholars, such as Ahmad Shafaat, contend that Islam permits women to be divorced in cases of domestic violence.&lt;ref name="shaf"/&gt; divorce may be unavailable to women as a practical or legal matter.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gavin. "Marriage and Divorce in Islamic South East Asia."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran states:
(2:231) And when you have divorced women and they have fulfilled the term of their prescribed period, either take them back on reasonable basis or set them free on reasonable basis. But do not take them back to hurt them, and whoever does that, then he has wronged himself. And treat not the Verses of Allah as a jest, but remember [[Islam|Allah's Favours]] on you, and that which He has sent down to you of the [[Quran|Book]] and Al-Hikmah [the Prophet's Sunnah, legal ways, Islamic jurisprudence] whereby He instructs you. And fear Allah, and know that Allah is All-Aware of everything.&lt;ref&gt;Muḥammad, Farida Khanam; Ḫān, Wahīd-ad-Dīn. (2009). The Quran. New Delhi: Goodword. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Islam permits women to divorce for domestic violence, they are subject to the laws of their nation which might make it quite difficult for a woman to obtain a divorce.&lt;ref name=Coomaraswamy/&gt;

Most [[women's rights activists]] concede that while divorce can provide potential relief, it does not constitute an adequate protection or even an option for many women, with discouraging factors such as lack of resources or support to establish alternative domestic arrangements and social expectations and pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Adelman, Howard, and Astri Suhrke.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3550">'''Judicial discretion''' is the power of the [[judiciary]] to make some legal decisions according to their [[discretion]]. Under the doctrine of the [[separation of powers]], the ability of [[judge]]s to exercise discretion is an aspect of [[judicial independence]]. Where appropriate, judicial discretion allows  a judge to decide a legal case or matter within a range of possible decisions.

However, where the exercise of discretion goes beyond constraints set down by [[legislation]], by [[binding precedent]], or by a [[constitution]], the court may be abusing its discretion and undermining the [[rule of law]].  In that case, the decision of the court may be ''[[ultra vires]]'', and may sometimes be characterized as [[judicial activism]].

In 1824, US Chief Justice [[John Marshall]] wrote the following on this subject:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Judicial power, as contradistinguished from the power of the laws, has no existence. Courts are the mere instruments of the law, and can will nothing. When they are said to exercise a discretion, it is a mere legal discretion, a discretion to be exercised in discerning the course prescribed by law; and, when that is discerned, it is the duty of the court to follow it. Judicial power is never exercised for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the judge, always for the purpose of giving effect to the will of the legislature; or, in other words, to the will of the law.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://supreme.justia.com/us/22/738/case.html Osborn V. Bank of the United States]'', 22 U. S. 738 (1824).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concerns with regard to [[recidivism]] and other [[law and order (politics)|law and order]] issues have led to the introduction of [[mandatory sentencing]]. E.g. [[three strikes law|three-strikes laws]] and most [[Sex offender registries in the United States|sex offender registry laws in US]] are examples of laws carrying severe consequences, and which does not leave room for sentencing judges to consider the actual gravity of the offense, thus significantly limiting judicial discretion in [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]]. Introduction of mandatory minimum in criminal sentencing is often viewed as a shift of judicial power from judges to [[prosecutor]]s, who are capable of affecting the length of potential sentence through their [[Prosecutorial discretion|charging decision]], e.g. filing [[Indictment|charges]] on [[lesser included offense]] and dropping the charges carrying mandatory minimum sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mandatory Minimum Penalties: Their Effects on Crime, Sentencing Disparities, and Justice System Expenditures|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/csj-sjc/ccs-ajc/rr02_1/p6.html|publisher=Department of Justice Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandatory sentencing laws have been particularly popular among legislators in the United States. This has provoked formation of non-profit organizations such as [[Families Against Mandatory Minimums]], [[Women Against Registry]] and [[RSOL]] to lobby for reinstatement of judicial discretion in criminal sentencing.

An early theory of justice was set out by the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Plato]] in his work ''The Republic''. Advocates of divine command theory say that justice issues from God. In the 17th century, theorists like [[John Locke]] advocated [[natural rights]] as a derivative of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Zuckert |first=Michael |title=The Natural Rights Republic |year=1996 |publisher=Notre Dame University Press |pages=73–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thinkers in the [[social contract]] tradition state that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned. In the 19th century, [[utilitarian]] thinkers including [[John Stuart Mill]] said that justice is what has the best consequences. Theories of distributive justice concern what is distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the ''proper'' distribution. [[Egalitarianism|Egalitarians]] state that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. [[John Rawls]] used a theory of [[social contract]] to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Property rights theorists (like [[Robert Nozick]]) take a deontological view of distributive justice and state that property rights-based justice maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice are concerned with [[punishment]] for wrongdoing. Restorative justice (also sometimes called "reparative justice") is an approach to justice that focuses on restoring what is good, and necessarily focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Laurence |first=Timothy |editor-last=Laurence |editor-first=Timothy |title=Good News for the Public Square |publisher=LCF |date=2014 |page=xxii |chapter=Overview |isbn=978-0-9506454-3-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harmony==

{{Main|The Republic (Plato)}}
[[File:Luca Giordano 013.jpg|thumb|''Justice'' by [[Luca Giordano]]]]
In his dialogue ''Republic'', [[Plato]] uses [[Socrates]] to argue for justice that covers both the just person and the just [[City State]]. Justice is a proper, harmonious relationship between the warring parts of the person or city. Hence, Plato's definition of justice is that justice is the having and doing of what is one's own. A just man is a man in just the right place, doing his best and giving the precise equivalent of what he has received. This applies both at the individual level and at the universal level. A person's soul has three parts&amp;nbsp;– reason, spirit and desire. Similarly, a city has three parts&amp;nbsp;– Socrates uses the parable of the chariot to illustrate his point: a chariot works as a whole because the two horses' power is directed by the charioteer. Lovers of wisdom&amp;nbsp;– philosophers, in one sense of the term&amp;nbsp;– [[Philosopher king|should rule]] because only they understand what is [[goodness and evil|good]]. If one is ill, one goes to a medic rather than a farmer, because the medic is expert in the subject of health. Similarly, one should trust one's city to an expert in the subject of the good, not to a mere [[politician]] who tries to gain power by giving people what they want, rather than what's good for them. Socrates uses the parable of the ship to illustrate this point: the unjust city is like a ship in open ocean, crewed by a powerful but drunken captain (the common people), a group of untrustworthy advisors who try to manipulate the captain into giving them power over the ship's course (the politicians), and a [[navigator]] (the philosopher) who is the only one who knows how to get the ship to port. For Socrates, the only way the ship will reach its destination&amp;nbsp;– the good&amp;nbsp;– is if the navigator takes charge.&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Republic'' trans. Robin Waterfield (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divine command==

{{Main|Divine command theory}}{{See also|Divine command}}
[[File:Domenico Beccafumi 012.jpg|thumb|Allegorical fresco cycle (cardinal virtues) by [[Renaissance]] painter [[Domenico di Pace Beccafumi]] from the Palazzo Pubblico in Siena, scene: ’’Justitia’’]]
Advocates of divine command theory argue that justice, and indeed the whole of morality, is the authoritative command of God. Murder is wrong and must be punished, for instance, because God says it so. Some versions of the theory assert that God must be obeyed because of the nature of his relationship with humanity, others assert that God must be obeyed because he is goodness itself, and thus doing what he says would be best for everyone.

A meditation on the Divine command theory by [[Plato]] can be found in his dialogue, [[Euthyphro]]. Called the [[Euthyphro dilemma]], it goes as follows: "Is what is morally good commanded by God because it is morally good, or is it morally good because it is commanded by God?" The implication is that if the latter is true, then justice is arbitrary; if the former is true, then morality exists on a higher order than God, who becomes little more than a passer-on of moral knowledge. A [[Argument from morality|response]], popularized in two contexts by [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[C. S. Lewis]], is that it is deductively valid to argue that the existence of an objective morality implies the existence of God and vice versa.

==Natural law==

{{Main|Natural law}}
[[File:VD-04-3.jpg|thumb|''Lex, justitia, pax'' ([[Latin]] for "Law, justice, peace") on the pediment of the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland|Supreme Court of Switzerland]]]]

For advocates of the theory that justice is part of natural law (e.g., [[John Locke]]), it involves the system of consequences that naturally derives from any action or choice. In this, it is similar to the laws of physics: in the same way as the Third of Newton's laws of Motion requires that for every action there must be an equal and opposite reaction, justice requires according individuals or groups what they actually deserve, merit, or are entitled to.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Justice, on this account, is a universal and absolute concept: laws, principles, religions, etc., are merely attempts to codify that concept, sometimes with results that entirely contradict the true nature of justice.

===Despotism and skepticism===

In ''Republic'' by [[Plato]], the character [[Thrasymachus]] argues that justice is the interest of the strong&amp;nbsp;– merely a name for what the powerful or cunning ruler has imposed on the people.
{{further|The Republic (Plato)}}

===Mutual agreement===

{{Main|Social contract}}
Advocates of the social contract agree that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned; or, in many versions, from what they would agree to under ''hypothetical'' conditions including equality and absence of bias. This account is considered further below, under 'Justice as fairness'. The absence of bias refers to an equal ground for all people concerned in a disagreement (or trial in some cases).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Subordinate value===
According to utilitarian thinkers including [[John Stuart Mill]], justice is not as fundamental as we often think. Rather, it is derived from the more basic standard of rightness, [[consequentialism]]: what is right is what has the best consequences (usually measured by the total or average [[Quality of life|welfare]] caused). So, the proper principles of justice are those that tend to have the best consequences. These rules may turn out to be familiar ones such as keeping [[contract]]s; but equally, they may not, depending on the facts about real consequences. Either way, what is important is those consequences, and justice is important, if at all, only as derived from that fundamental standard. Mill tries to explain our mistaken belief that justice is overwhelmingly important by arguing that it derives from two natural human tendencies: our desire to retaliate against those who hurt us, or the feeling of self-defense and our ability to put ourselves imaginatively in another's place, sympathy. So, when we see someone harmed, we project ourselves into her situation and feel a desire to retaliate on her behalf. If this process is the source of our feelings about justice, that ought to undermine our confidence in them.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill, ''Utilitarianism'' in ''On Liberty and Other Essays'' ed. John Gray (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of distributive justice==
{{Main|Distributive justice}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Theories of distributive justice need to answer three questions:
# ''What goods'' are to be distributed? Is it to be [[wealth]], [[Political power|power]], [[respect]], opportunities or some combination of these things?
# ''Between what entities'' are they to be distributed? Humans (dead, living, future), [[Sentience|sentient]] beings, the members of a single society, [[nation]]s?
# What is the ''proper'' distribution? Equal, [[Meritocracy|meritocratic]], according to [[social status]], according to [[need]], based on property rights and non-aggression?

Distributive justice theorists generally do not answer questions of ''who has the right'' to enforce a particular favored distribution.  On the other hand, property rights theorists argue that there is no "favored distribution."  Rather, distribution should be based simply on whatever distribution results from lawful interactions or transactions (that is, transactions which are not illicit).

This section describes some widely held theories of distributive justice, and their attempts to answer these questions.

===Social justice===
{{Main|Social justice}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Social justice is concerned with the just relationship between individuals and their society, often considering how privileges, opportunities, and wealth ought to be distributed among individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/social_justice|title=social justice {{!}} Definition of social justice in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social justice is distinct from egalitarianism, which is the idea that all people are equal in terms of status, value, or rights, as social justice theories do not all require equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/egalitarianism|title=egalitarianism {{!}} Definition of egalitarianism in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sociologist [[George C. Homans]] suggested that the root of the concept of justice is that each person should receive rewards that are proportional to their contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubinstein|first=David|date=1988|title=The Concept of Justice in Sociology|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/657654|journal=Theory and Society|volume=17|issue=4|pages=527–550}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2668194|title=Social behavior; its elementary forms.|last=Homans|first=George Caspar|publisher=Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich|year=1974|isbn=0155814176|edition= Rev.|location=New York,|pages=246–249|oclc=2668194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the egalitarian, justice can exist only within the parameters of equality. This basic view can be elaborated in many ways, according to what goods are to be distributed&amp;nbsp;– wealth, respect, opportunity&amp;nbsp;– and who or what they are to be distributed equally among&amp;nbsp;– individuals, families, nations, races, species. Egalitarian theories are typically less concerned with discussing who exactly will do the distributing or what effects their recommended policies will have on the production of the goods, services, or resources they wish to distribute.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Commonly held egalitarian positions include demands for [[equality of opportunity]], though equality of opportunity is often defended by adherents of nonegalitarian conceptions of justice as well. Some variants of egalitarianism affirm that justice without equality is hollow and that equality itself is the highest justice, though such a formulation will have concrete meaning only once the main terms have been fleshed out.

At a cultural level, egalitarian theories have developed in sophistication and acceptance during the past two hundred years. Among the notable broadly egalitarian philosophies are communism, socialism, [[left-libertarianism]], and progressivism, which propound economic, political, and legal egalitarianism, respectively.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Fairness===
{{More citations needed|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Justice statue.jpg|thumb|J. L. Urban, statue of [[Lady Justice]] at court building in [[Olomouc]], [[Czech Republic]]]]

In his ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', [[John Rawls]] used a [[social contract]] argument to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness: an impartial distribution of goods. Rawls asks us to imagine ourselves behind a [[veil of ignorance]] that denies us all knowledge of our personalities, social statuses, moral characters, wealth, talents and life plans, and then asks what theory of justice we would choose to govern our society when the veil is lifted, if we wanted to do the best that we could for ourselves. We don't know who in particular we are, and therefore can't bias the decision in our own favour. So, the decision-in-ignorance models fairness, because it excludes selfish [[bias]]. Rawls argues that each of us would reject the [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] theory of justice that we should maximize welfare (see below) because of the risk that we might turn out to be someone whose own good is sacrificed for greater benefits for others. Instead, we would endorse Rawls's ''two principles of justice'':
* Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all.
* Social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are both
** to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged, consistent with the just savings principle, and
** attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, ''A Theory of Justice'' (revised edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

This imagined choice justifies these principles as the principles of justice for us, because we would agree to them in a fair decision procedure. Rawls's theory distinguishes two kinds of goods&amp;nbsp;– (1) [[Freedom (political)|the good of liberty rights]] and (2) social and economic goods, i.e. wealth, income and power&amp;nbsp;– and applies different distributions to them&amp;nbsp;– equality between citizens for (1), equality unless inequality improves the position of the worst off for (2).

In one sense, theories of distributive justice may assert that everyone should get what they deserve. Theories disagree on the meaning of what is "deserved". The main distinction is between theories that argue the basis of just deserts ought to be held equally by everyone, and therefore derive egalitarian accounts of distributive justice&amp;nbsp;– and theories that argue the basis of just deserts is unequally distributed on the basis of, for instance, hard work, and therefore derive accounts of distributive justice by which some should have more than others.

According to ''[[Meritocracy|meritocratic]]'' theories, goods, especially wealth and [[social status]], should be distributed to match individual ''merit'', which is usually understood as some combination of talent and hard work. According to ''[[need]]s''-based theories, goods, especially such basic goods as food, shelter and medical care, should be distributed to meet individuals' [[basic needs]] for them. [[Marxism]] is a needs-based theory, expressed succinctly in [[Karl Marx|Marx's]] slogan "[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]".&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, 'Critique of the Gotha Program' in ''Karl Marx: Selected writings'' ed. David McLellan (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977): 564–70, p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''contribution''-based theories, goods should be distributed to match an individual's contribution to the overall social good.

===Property rights===
{{further|Libertarianism|Constitutional economics}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
In ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'', [[Robert Nozick]] argues that distributive justice is not a matter of the whole distribution matching an ideal ''pattern'', but of each individual entitlement having the right kind of ''history''. It is just that a person has some good (especially, some [[Property rights|property right]]) if and only if they came to have it by a history made up entirely of events of two kinds:
* Just ''acquisition'', especially by working on unowned things; and
* Just ''transfer'', that is free gift, sale or other agreement, but not [[theft]] (i.e. by force or fraud).

If the chain of events leading up to the person having something meets this criterion, they are entitled to it: that they possess it is just, and what anyone else does or doesn't have or need is irrelevant.

On the basis of this theory of distributive justice, Nozick argues that all attempts to redistribute goods according to an ideal pattern, without the consent of their owners, are theft. In particular, [[redistribution (economics)|redistributive taxation]] is theft.

Some property rights theorists (like Nozick) also take a consequentialist view of distributive justice and argue that property rights based justice also has the effect of maximizing the overall wealth of an economic system.  They explain that voluntary (non-coerced) transactions always have a property called [[Pareto efficiency]]. The result is that the world is better off in an absolute sense and no one is worse off.  Such consequentialist property rights theorists argue that respecting property rights maximizes the number of Pareto efficient transactions in the world and minimized the number of non-Pareto efficient transactions in the world (i.e. transactions where someone is made worse off).  The result is that the world will have generated the greatest total benefit from the limited, scarce resources available in the world.  Further, this will have been accomplished without taking anything away from anyone unlawfully.

===Welfare-maximization===
{{Main|Utilitarianism}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
According to the utilitarian, justice requires the maximization of the total or average welfare across all relevant individuals. This may require sacrifice of some for the good of others, so long as everyone's good is taken impartially into account. Utilitarianism, in general, argues that the standard of justification for actions, institutions, or the whole world, is ''impartial welfare consequentialism'', and only indirectly, if at all, to do with [[Human rights|rights]], [[property]], [[need]], or any other non-utilitarian criterion. These other criteria might be indirectly important, to the extent that human welfare involves them. But even then, such demands as human rights would only be elements in the calculation of overall welfare, not uncrossable barriers to action.

==Theories of retributive justice==
{{Main|Retributive justice}}

[[File:Justicia Ottawa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Walter Seymour Allward]]'s ''Justitia'' (Justice), outside [[Supreme Court of Canada]], [[Ottawa, Ontario]] [[Canada]]]]
Theories of retributive justice are concerned with [[punishment]] for wrongdoing, and need to answer three questions:
# ''why'' punish?
# ''who'' should be punished?
# ''what punishment'' should they receive?
This section considers the two major accounts of retributive justice, and their answers to these questions. ''Utilitarian'' theories look forward to the future consequences of punishment, while ''retributive'' theories look back to particular acts of wrongdoing, and attempt to balance them with deserved punishment.

===Utilitarianism===
According to the utilitarian, justice requires the maximization of the total or average welfare across all relevant individuals. Punishment fights crime in three ways:
# ''[[Deterrence (legal)|Deterrence]]''. The credible [[coercion|threat]] of punishment might lead people to make different choices; well-designed threats might lead people to make choices that maximize welfare. This matches some strong [[intuition]]s about just punishment: that it should generally be proportional to the crime.
# ''[[Rehabilitation (penology)|Rehabilitation]]''. Punishment might make bad people into better ones. For the utilitarian, all that 'bad person' can mean is 'person who's likely to cause bad things (like suffering)'. So, utilitarianism could recommend punishment that changes someone such that they are less likely to cause bad things.
# ''[[Incapacitation (penology)|Security/Incapacitation]]''. Perhaps there are people who are irredeemable causers of bad things. If so, [[Prison|imprisoning]] them might maximize welfare by limiting their opportunities to cause harm and therefore the benefit lies within protecting society.
So, the reason for punishment is the maximization of welfare, and punishment should be of whomever, and of whatever form and severity, are needed to meet that goal. This may sometimes justify punishing the innocent, or inflicting disproportionately severe punishments, when that will have the best consequences overall (perhaps executing a few suspected [[Shoplifting|shoplifters]] live on television would be an effective deterrent to shoplifting, for instance). It also suggests that punishment might turn out ''never'' to be right, depending on the facts about what actual consequences it has.&lt;ref&gt;C. L. Ten, 'Crime and Punishment' in Peter Singer ed., ''A Companion to Ethics'' (Oxford: [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell Publishing]], 1993): 366–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retributivism===
The retributivist will think [[consequentialism]] is mistaken. If someone does something wrong we must respond by punishing for the committed action itself, regardless of what outcomes punishment produces. Wrongdoing must be balanced or made good in some way, and so the criminal ''deserves'' to be punished. It says that all guilty people, and only guilty people, deserve appropriate punishment. This matches some strong [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitions]] about just punishment: that it should be ''proportional'' to the crime, and that it should be of ''only'' and ''all of'' the guilty.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} However, it is sometimes argued that retributivism is merely [[revenge]] in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Honderich, ''Punishment: The supposed justifications'' (London: Hutchinson &amp; Co., 1969), Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are differences between retribution and revenge: the former is impartial and has a scale of appropriateness, whereas the latter is personal and potentially unlimited in scale.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Restorative justice===
{{Main|Restorative justice}}

Restorative justice (also sometimes called "reparative justice") is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of victims and offenders, instead of satisfying abstract legal principles or punishing the offender. Victims take an active role in the process, while offenders are encouraged to take responsibility for their actions, "to repair the harm they've done&amp;nbsp;– by apologizing, returning stolen money, or community service". It is based on a theory of justice that considers crime and wrongdoing to be an offense against an individual or community rather than the state. Restorative justice that fosters dialogue between victim and offender shows the highest rates of victim satisfaction and offender accountability.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Braswell, and John Fuller, ''Corrections, Peacemaking and Restorative Justice: Transforming Individuals and Institutions'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed theories===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
Some modern philosophers have argued that Utilitarian and Retributive theories are not mutually exclusive. For example, [[Andrew von Hirsch]], in his 1976 book ''Doing Justice'', suggested that we have a moral obligation to punish greater crimes more than lesser ones. However, so long as we adhere to that constraint then utilitarian ideals would play a significant secondary role.

==Theories==

===Rawls' theory of justice===
{{further|Justice (virtue)|Cardinal virtues}}
It has been argued&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Eric Heinze, ''The Concept of Injustice'' (Routledge, 2013), pp. 4–10, 50–60.&lt;/ref&gt; that 'systematic' or 'programmatic' political and moral philosophy in the West begins, in [[Plato]]'s [[Plato Republic|Republic]], with the question, 'What is Justice?'&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''The Republic'', Book I, 331b–c.&lt;/ref&gt; According to most contemporary theories of justice, justice is overwhelmingly important: [[John Rawls]] claims that "Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought."&lt;ref&gt;John Rawls, ''A Theory of Justice'' (revised edn, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In classical approaches, evident from [[Plato]] through to [[John Rawls|Rawls]], the concept of 'justice' is always construed in logical or 'etymological' opposition to the concept of injustice. Such approaches cite various examples of injustice, as problems which a theory of justice must overcome.  A number of post-World War II approaches do, however, challenge that seemingly obvious dualism between those two concepts.&lt;ref&gt;
*See, e.g., Eric Heinze, ''The Concept of Injustice'' (Routledge, 2013).
*Clive Barnett ''The Priority of Injustice: Locating Democracy in Critical Theory''&lt;/ref&gt; Justice can be thought of as distinct from [[wikt:benevolence|benevolence]], [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], [[prudence (virtue)|prudence]], [[mercy]], [[generosity]], or [[compassion]], although these dimensions are regularly understood to also be interlinked. Justice is the concept of [[cardinal virtue]]s, of which it is one.  Metaphysical justice has often been associated with concepts of [[destiny|fate]], [[reincarnation]] or [[Divine Providence]], i.e., with a life in accordance with a cosmic plan. The association of justice with fairness is thus historically and culturally inalienable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Daston|first=Lorraine|year=2008|journal=Daedalus|pages=5–14|title=Life, Chance and Life Chances|doi=10.1162/daed.2008.137.1.5|volume=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equality before the law===
Law raises important and complex issues concerning equality, fairness, and justice. There is an old saying that '[[All are equal before the law]]'. The belief in equality before the law is called legal egalitarianism. In criticism of this belief, the author [[Anatole France]] said in 1894, "In its majestic equality, the law forbids [[rich and poor alike]] to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets, and steal loaves of bread."&lt;ref&gt;(France, ''The Red Lily'', [http://www.online-literature.com/anatole-france/red-lily/8/ Chapter VII]).&lt;/ref&gt; With this saying, France illustrated the fundamental shortcoming of a theory of legal equality that remains blind to social inequality;
the same law applied to all may have disproportionately harmful effects on the least powerful.

===Classical liberalism===
Equality before the law is one of the basic principles of [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref name=kukathas/&gt;&lt;ref name=evans/&gt; Classical liberalism calls for equality before the law, not for [[equality of outcome]].&lt;ref name=kukathas&gt;[[Chandran Kukathas]], "Ethical Pluralism from a Classical Liberal Perspective," in ''The Many and the One: Religious and Secular Perspectives on Ethical Pluralism in the Modern World'', ed. Richard Madsen and Tracy B. Strong, Ethikon Series in Comparative Ethics (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2003), 61 ({{ISBN|0-691-09993-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Classical liberalism opposes pursuing [[group rights]] at the expense of [[individual rights]].&lt;ref name=evans&gt;Mark Evans, ed., ''Edinburgh Companion to Contemporary Liberalism: Evidence and Experience'' (London: Routledge, 2001), 55 ({{ISBN|1-57958-339-3}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion and spirituality===

====Abrahamic justice====
[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 079.jpg|thumbnail|''Moses with the [[Tablets of Law]]'', by [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]]]]

[[Judaism|Jews]], [[Islam|Muslims]] and [[Christianity|Christians]] traditionally believe that justice is a present, real, right, and, specifically, governing concept along with [[mercy]], and that justice is ultimately derived from and held by [[God]]. According to the [[Bible]], such [[institution]]s as the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic Law]] were created by God to require the [[Israelites]] to live by and apply His standards of justice.

The Hebrew Bible describes God as saying about the Judeo-Christian [[patriarch]] [[Abraham]]: "No, for I have chosen him, that he may charge his children and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice;...." ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 18:19, [[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV)]]. The [[Psalms|Psalmist]] describes God as having "Righteousness and justice [as] the foundation of [His] throne;...." (Psalms 89:14, NRSV).

The [[New Testament]] also describes God and [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] as having and displaying justice, often in comparison with God displaying and supporting [[mercy]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:7).

===Theories of sentencing===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
In [[criminal law]], a [[Sentence (law)|sentence]] forms the final explicit act of a [[judge]]-ruled process, and also the symbolic principal act connected to his function. The sentence can generally involve a decree of [[prison|imprisonment]], a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] and/or other [[punishment]]s against a [[defendant]] [[conviction (law)|convicted]] of a [[crime]]. Laws may specify the range of penalties that can be imposed for various offenses, and sentencing guidelines sometimes regulate what punishment within those ranges can be imposed given a certain set of offense and offender characteristics. The most common purposes of sentencing in legal theory are:

|- style="background:#b0c4de; text-align:center;"

|[[Retributive justice|Retribution]]

|-
|}

In [[civil law (common law)|civil cases]] the decision is usually known as a [[verdict]], or judgment, rather than a sentence. Civil cases are settled primarily by means of monetary compensation for harm done ("[[damages]]") and orders intended to prevent future harm (for example [[injunction]]s). Under some legal systems an award of damages involves some scope for retribution, denunciation and deterrence, by means of additional categories of damages beyond simple compensation, covering a [[Punitive damages|punitive effect, social disapprobation, and potentially, deterrence]], and occasionally [[Disgorgement (law)|disgorgement]] (forfeit of any gain, even if no loss was caused to the other party).

===Evolutionary perspectives===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
[[File:Gerechtigkeit-1537.jpg|thumb|"Justice as a naked woman with a [[sword]] and [[Weighing scale|balance]]" by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1537]]

[[Evolutionary ethic]]s and an argued [[evolution of morality]] suggest [[evolutionary]] bases for the concept of justice. [[Biosocial criminology]] research argues that human perceptions of what is appropriate criminal justice are based on how to respond to crimes in the ancestral small-group environment and that these responses may not always be appropriate for today's societies.

===Reactions to fairness===
[[File:Justitia, Jost Amman.png|thumb|‘’Justitia’’, copper engraving by [[Jost Amman]], made between 1539 and 1591]]
Studies at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in 2008 have indicated that reactions to fairness are "wired" into the brain and that, "Fairness is activating the same part of the brain that responds to food in rats... This is consistent with the notion that being treated fairly satisfies a basic need".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/brain-reacts-to-fairness-as-it-49042.aspx?link_page_rss=49042 |title=Brain reacts to fairness as it does to money and chocolate, study shows |work=UCLA Newsroom |publisher= UCLA |date=April 21, 2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted in 2003 at [[Emory University]] involving capuchin monkeys demonstrated that other cooperative animals also possess such a sense and that "[[inequity aversion]] may not be uniquely human".&lt;ref&gt;Nature 425, 297–99 (18 September 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions and justice===

In a world where people are interconnected but they disagree, institutions are required to instantiate ideals of justice. These institutions may be justified by their approximate instantiation of justice, or they may be deeply unjust when compared with ideal standards&amp;nbsp;– consider the institution of [[slavery]]. Justice is an ideal the world fails to live up to, sometimes due to deliberate opposition to justice despite understanding, which could be disastrous. The question of institutive justice raises issues of [[Legitimacy (political science)|legitimacy]], [[Legal procedure|procedure]], [[Codification (law)|codification]] and [[statutory interpretation|interpretation]], which are considered by legal theorists and by [[Philosophy of law|philosophers of law]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[File:Kri-Kri, Samaria Gorge, Crete, female.jpg|thumb|left|Adult female in natural [[habitat]], Samaria Gorge National Park]]
The '''kri-kri''' (''Capra aegagrus cretica''), sometimes called the '''Cretan goat''', '''Agrimi''', or '''Cretan Ibex''', is a [[feral goat]] inhabiting the Eastern [[Mediterranean]], previously considered a [[subspecies]] of [[wild goat]]. The kri-kri is now found only on the island of [[Crete]], [[Greece]] and three small islands just offshore ([[Dia, Greece|Dia]], [[Thodorou]] and [[Agii Pantes]]). 

&lt;!-- [[File:Kri-kri 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Close-up of adult, [[Samaria Gorge]] National Park]] --&gt;
The kri-kri has a light brownish coat with a darker band around its neck. It has two horns that sweep back from the head. In the wild they are shy and avoid humans, resting during the day. The animal can leap some distance or climb seemingly sheer cliffs.

The kri-kri is not thought to be indigenous to Crete, most likely having been imported to the island during the time of the [[Minoan civilization]]. Nevertheless, it is found nowhere else and is therefore [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to Crete. It was once common throughout the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] but the peaks of the 2,400 m (8,000&amp;nbsp;ft) [[Lefka Ori|White Mountains]] of Western Crete are their last strongholds—particularly a series of almost vertical 900 m (3,000&amp;nbsp;ft) cliffs called 'the Untrodden'&amp;mdash;at the head of the [[Samaria Gorge]]. This mountain range, which hosts another 14 endemic animal species, is protected as a [[UNESCO]] [[Biosphere Reserve]]. In total, their range extends to the White Mountains, the Samaria National Forest and the islets of Dia, Thodorou, and Agii Pandes. Recently some were introduced onto two more islands.

By 1960, the kri-kri was under threat, with a population below 200. It had been the only meat available to mountain guerillas during the [[Germany|German]] occupation in [[World War II]]. Its status was one reasons why the Samaria Gorge became a [[national park]] in 1962. There are still only about 2,000 animals on the island and they are considered vulnerable: hunters still seek them for their tender meat, grazing grounds have become scarcer and disease has affected them. Hybridization is also a threat, as the population has interbred with ordinary goats. Hunting them is strictly prohibited.

[[File:Chlorite relief rhyton, Zakros, 1500-1450 BC, AMH, 135307.jpg|thumb|left|[[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] rhyton from the Palace of [[Zakros]], depicting a rocky landscape with Cretan goats.]]
[[Archaeological]] excavations have unearthed several depictions of the kri-kri. Some academics believe that the animal was worshiped during antiquity. On the island, males are often called 'agrimi' ({{lang-el|αγρίμι}}, i.e. 'the wild one'), while the name 'sanada' ({{lang-el|σανάδα}}) is used for the female. The kri-kri is a symbol of the island, much used in tourism marketing and official literature.

As molecular analyses demonstrate, the kri-kri is not, as previously thought, a distinct subspecies of wild goat. Rather, it is a [[feral]] [[domestic goat]], derived from the first stocks of goats domesticated in the [[Levant]] and other parts of the Eastern Mediterranean around 8000-7500 BCE. Therefore, it represents a nearly ten-thousand-year-old "snapshot" of the first domestication of goats.

In any case, the kri-kri is an emblem of Crete and has immense cultural significance there. Legally however, [[endangered species]] legislation would likely not apply (as this does not cover feral populations), but similar cases elsewhere have been covered under [[Cultural resources management|cultural heritage protection]] laws.

'''Leaving the nest''' or '''moving out''' refers to the notion of a young person moving out of the accommodation provided by their guardian, [[fosterer]]s or [[parent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Apter|first1=Terry|title=The Myth of Maturity: What Teenagers Need from Parents to Become Adults|date=2002|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a move can be motivated by various factors, including a desire for independence, the discovery of a more viable location and/or practicality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peace|first1=Sheila|title=Adult Lives: A Life Course Perspective|date=2011|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age at which young people move out of their previous accommodation has been rising since the turn of the [[21st century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2014/article/independence-for-young-millennials-moving-out-and-boomeranging-back.htm|title=Independence for young millennials: moving out and boomeranging back : Monthly Labor Review: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=R.|first=Dey,Judith G.;Pierret,Charles|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures view leaving the nest as one of the key milestones in the transition from tweenhood or teenhood to becoming an adult besides obtaining employment and getting wedded.&lt;ref&gt;Furstenberg, Frank F., Ruben G. Rumbaut, and Richard A. Settersten. "On the frontier of adulthood: Emerging themes and new directions." On the frontier of adulthood: Theory, research, and public policy (2005): 3-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures, especially [[Middle Eastern]] ones, it is not as socially acceptable for a woman or girl to leave the home to live by herself without a marriage arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnett|first1=Jeffrey|title=International encyclopedia of adolescence: A-J, index, Volume 1|date=2007|page=1038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that a delay in leaving the nest may result in a decrease in [[sexual activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/new-research-suggests-young-people-are-going-off-sex-1.2742803|title=New research suggests young people are going off sex|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
=== "Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches", 1995===
In his article "Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches'", Suchman defines legitimacy as "a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions."&lt;ref name="Suchman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suchman|first1=Mark|title=Managing Legitimacy: Strategic and Institutional Approaches|journal=The Academy of Management Review |date=1995 |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=571–610 |doi=10.5465/amr.1995.9508080331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later adds to this definition, stating that because legitimacy is socially conferred, legitimacy is independent of individual participants, while dependent upon the collective constituency. In other words, an organization is legitimate when it enjoys public approval, even though the actions of an organization might deviate from particular individual interests.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;

Suchman states three types of legitimacy: 
* pragmatic legitimacy, 
* moral legitimacy, and 
* cognitive legitimacy.

=== Pragmatic legitimacy ===
Pragmatic legitimacy relies upon the self-interests of an organizations constituencies, in which the constituency scrutinizes actions and behaviors taken by the organization in order to determine their effects.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; This is further broken down into three sub-sections: 
* exchange legitimacy, 
* influence legitimacy, and 
* dispositional legitimacy. 
Suchman defines exchange legitimacy as the support for organizational policies due to the policy's benefit to the constituencies.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heidhues|first1=Eva|last2=Patel|first2=Chris|title=Globalization and Contextual Factors in Accounting: The Case of Germany|date=2012|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|pages=86–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Influence legitimacy is the support for the organization not due to the benefits that constituencies believe they will receive, but rather due to their belief that the organization will be responsive to their larger interests.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues/&gt;

Dispositional legitimacy is defined as support for an organization due to the good attributes constituencies believe the organization has, such as trustworthy, decent, or wise.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues/&gt; This is due to the fact that people typically personify organizations and characterize them as being autonomous.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;

=== Moral legitimacy ===
Moral legitimacy is dependent upon whether the actions of an organization or institution are judged to be moral.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; In other words, if the constituency  believe the organization is breaking the rules of the political or economic system for immoral reasons, then this can threaten moral legitimacy.&lt;ref name=Yankelovich&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yankelovich|first1=Daniel|title=A Crisis of Moral Legitimacy|date=1974|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suchman breaks moral legitimacy down into four sub-sections:
* consequential legitimacy, 
* procedural legitimacy, 
* structural legitimacy, and 
* personal legitimacy. 
Consequential legitimacy relates to what an organization has accomplished based on criteria that is specific to that organization. Procedural legitimacy can be obtained by an organization by adhering to socially formalized and accepted procedures (e.g. regulatory oversight). In the case of structural legitimacy, people view an organization as legitimate because its structural characteristics allow it to do specific kinds of work.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brinkerhoff |first1=Derick |title=Organizational Legitimacy, Capacity, and Capacity Development|journal=Public Management Research Association|date=2005|pages=1–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suchman refers to this organization as being the "right organization for the job."&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt; Lastly, personal legitimacy refers to legitimacy that is derived from the charisma of individual leaders.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heidhues/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff/&gt;

=== Cognitive legitimacy ===
Cognitive legitimacy is created when an organization pursues goals that society deems to be proper and desirable.&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff/&gt;
Constituency support for the organization is not due to self-interest, but rather due to its taken-for-granted character.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaison&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chaison|first1=Gary|last2=Bigelow|first2=Barbara|title=Unions and Legitimacy|date=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sun |first1=William |last2=Louche |first2=Céline|last3=Pérez|first3=Roland|title=Finance and Sustainability: Towards a New Paradigm? A Post-Crisis Agenda|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing Limited|date=2011|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an organization has reached this taken-for-granted status, an organization is beyond dissent.&lt;ref name=Suchman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaison /&gt; While moral and pragmatic legitimacy deal with some form of evaluation, cognitive legitimacy does not. Instead, with cognitive legitimacy society accepts these organizations as being necessary or inevitable.&lt;ref name=Brinkerhoff/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaison/&gt;

'''Martin Böttger''' (born 14 May 1947 in Frankenhain, a village now part of [[Frohburg]]) was a prominent civil rights activist in [[German Democratic Republic|East Germany]]. He was a member of the [[Landtag of the Free State of Saxony]] from 1990 to 1994 and led the faction of [[Alliance '90/The Greens]].

== Life and politics ==
Böttger studied physics at the [[TU Dresden]] and was a [[Construction soldier]] until 1972. Since 1972 he was active in church-based peace activism. He worked as a computer programmer at [[Robotron]] [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]] until 1976 and at Versorgungskontor Leder until 1979. He worked as a research associate at the [[Deutsche Bauakademie]] until 1983. In 1982 he gained a doctorate in technical mechanics at the TU Dresden under [[Günther Landgraf]].

In 1976 and 1980 he was briefly arrested by the [[Stasi]] for participating in first of May demonstrations using a self-made sign. In September 1983 he was arrested for a longer period for "attempted participation in a [[human chain]] during the [[International Day of Peace]]". From the year 1985 on, Böttger worked as a computer programmer at the state-owned gasoline retailer [[Minol]]. In 1985 he co-founded the [[Initiative for Peace and Human Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jugendopposition.de/index.php?id=2367 Martin Böttger mit weiteren Mitgliedern der IFM 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; led this group's task force „Human rights and the judiciary" and contributed to the publication and dissemination of underground [[Samizdat]] magazines.

In 1989 he was a founding member of [[New Forum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jugendopposition.de/index.php?id=1723 Martin Böttger bei der Gründung des Neuen Forum in Grünheide]&lt;/ref&gt; and the coordinator of this civil rights movement in the district of [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]]. In March 1990 he was elected into the [[Volkskammer]] with [[Bündnis 90]], but immediately handed the mandate to [[Werner Schulz]].

== Bürokratopoly ==
Bürokratopoly is an educational tabletop game. Its author Martin Böttger used to satirize the East German state in the early 1980s. The game spread in the political underground. Over 30 years after its development it was remade and optimized as a teaching aid for use in history class. Bürokratopoly captures an authentic perspective on East Germany in game form and provokes discussions of democracy, politics and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bürokratopoly - Ein Lehrspiel aus der DDR|trans-title=|periodical=www.buerokratopoly.de|publisher=|url=http://www.buerokratopoly.de/|format=|accessdate=2016-01-16|last=DDR-Museum|date=2014|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Morris Knibb''', '''MBE''' (28 February 1886 – 21 September 1964) was a [[Jamaica]]n teacher, social reformer and philanthropist.  She founded the Morris Knibb Preparatory School and donated a building which is used as the headquarters of the [[Church of the Redeemer, Jamaica|Moravian Church in Jamaica]] as well as land for construction of a community center. Morris Knibb was a women's rights activist and the first elected councilwomen in Jamaica. She was the first woman to vie for a seat in the [[Parliament of Jamaica|House]] when Universal Suffrage was granted to all Jamaicans.

==Early life==
Mary Lenora Morris{{sfn|Bell|2002|p=179}} "Nora" was born on 28 February 1886{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|28 February 1953|p=13}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|10 April 1953|p=18}} in [[Carmel, Westmoreland, Jamaica|Carmel]], [[Westmoreland Parish]], Jamaica. In 1893, Morris began teaching as an assistant teacher at the Moravian Day School,{{sfn|Bell|2002|p=179}} in the customary [[Student teacher|pupil-teacher]] system of recruitment. Throughout the Caribbean prior to the 1950s, the most promising primary students, began working as assistant teachers to offset the cost of their further education. In some cases, they became full teachers upon passing an examination and in others were  sent after their pupil-teacher contractual period to [[normal schools]] for additional training.{{sfn|Miller|1999|p=11}}{{sfn|Steward|Thomas|1996|pp=40–41, 133}} Morris, followed the latter path and attended the [[Shortwood Teachers' College]]. While attending the college, Morris became one of the founders of the Alumni Students' Association.{{sfn|Bell|2002|p=179}}

==Career==
Between 1907 and 1917, Morris taught at the St. George Girls' School{{sfn|Bell|2002|p=179}} and then taught for almost two years at the Central Branch School.  She then became the headmistress of the Wesley School, where she remained until 1928.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner|1928|p=10}} In 1931, the now married Morris, opened her own school, the Mary Morris-Knibb Preparatory School in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]], at 3 Hector Street, Saint Andrew Parish, which she had inherited a few months previously upon the death of Frances Morris.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|28 March 1931|p=21}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|27 May 1931|p=21}} Catering to the middle-class, Morris-Knibb was known to provide an excellent education and stern discipline.{{sfn|Bell|2002|p=179}} Students were required to study geography, history, Latin, math, reading, spelling, and writing, earning the school the reputation as "one of the leading preparatory schools in the nation".{{sfn|Trouth Sr.|2015|p=37}}

In 1936 or 1937, she co-founded, along with Amy Bailey, [[Eulalie Domingo]] and [[Edith Dalton James]], the Jamaica Women’s Liberal Club (LC).{{sfn|Reddock|1990|p=67}}{{sfn|De Barros|2014|pp=161–162}} The organization was mostly made up of teachers and their goal was to agitate for women's inclusion in government service, including such posts as serving on the school board and civil service. Most of the women were black and middle-class women who wanted to advance the position of women in society on both socio-economic and political levels.{{sfn|Reddock|1990|p=67}} One of the social protections for which Morris Knibb advocated was marriage. In part because of morality concerns, but in part because common-law arrangements did not protect children adequately, she favored even holding mass weddings so that the costs of the ceremony would be reduced and participation greater.{{sfn|Cooper|1995|pp=50–54}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|13 September 1939|p=1}} When black women, like Morris-Knibb wanted to participate in the Child Welfare Association of Jamaica, they were told they were not welcome.{{sfn|Hemming|1976}}{{sfn|De Barros|2014|p=118}} The upperclass women of the Child Welfare Association suggested that the black women set up an auxiliary for women of their "shade".{{sfn|Altink|2011}} In response, Morris-Knibb joined [[Amy Bailey]], [[May Farquharson]], Dr. Jai Lal Varma, and Dr. Pengelley and others in founding the Save the Children Fund in 1938.{{sfn|Hemming|1976}}{{sfn|De Barros|2014|p=118}}

Morris Knibb was one of the leaders in the fight for Jamaican suffrage{{sfn|Jamaica Information Service|2004}} and as it had been a long-practiced method for women to gain a foothold and show their readiness to vote,{{sfn|Ray|1918|pp=469-474}} she was in favor of women running for local offices.{{sfn|Bell|2002|p=179}} In 1939, the LC organized women and ran a campaign with Morris Knibb as their candidate for parish council. She won the seat for the Kingston/[[Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica|Saint Andrew Parish]] seat on the council,{{sfn|Reddock|1990|p=74}} becoming the first woman to serve as an elected official in Jamaica.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1939|p=1}} Her work on the council focused on education and social services. She advocated for creation of after school programs, night schools, and trade education, utilizing existing school and government buildings for the purpose.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|11 August 1939|p=27}} She donated property located at 15 Byrnes Street to the Lower St. Andrews Citizen's Association to facilitate creation of a community centre{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|28 August 1939|p=7}} and was active in programs to care for the poor and the aged.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1943|p=3}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1947|p=10}}

When [[Universal suffrage|universal franchise]] was granted to Jamaicans in 1944, Morris Knibb immediately opened a campaign to run for a seat in the House, becoming the first woman to contest a general election in Jamaica.{{sfn|Bell|2002|p=179}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1944|p=10}} Though she didn't win, she was undaunted, becoming one of the first women sworn in as Justice of the Peace in 1945{{sfn|Bell|2002|p=179}} and continuing to serve as a councilwoman through the early 1950s.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1947|p=10}} In 1953, she was honored with the [[Order of the British Empire]] for her years of social service.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|28 February 1953|p=13}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|27 February 1953|p=16}} Throughout the 1950s, she continued her work with the Moravian Church and served several terms as the vice-chair of the school board.{{sfn|Jamaica Information Service|2004}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1956|p=8}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1959|p=18}}

==Death and legacy==
Morris Knibb died on 21 September 1964 in Woodford Park, Saint Andrew Parish, Jamaica.{{sfn|Brown|2004}} She donated the building which is used as the headquarters of the Moravian Church, 3 Hector Street, Kingston, Jamaica, to the organization.{{sfn|Tyson|2005|p=2}} Generations of students have been educated at the Morris Knibb Preparatory School, including many prominent Jamaicans. In 1984, the school was relocated, from its original location next to the Moravian Church, to Molynes Road in St. Andrew Parish, teaching kindergarten to grade 6.{{sfn|Bell|2002|p=179}} In 2004, as part of the Moravian Church's 250th anniversary, the church worked to have the [[Postal Corporation of Jamaica]] issue commemorative stamps of important leaders in their organization. Morris Knibb was one of three honorees recognized in the commemorative stamp series.{{sfn|Jamaica Information Service|2004}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3296">A '''moral hierarchy''' is a [[hierarchy]] by which actions are ranked by their [[morality]], with respect to a [[moral code]]. 

It also refers to a relationship – such as teacher/pupil or [[guru]]/disciple – in which one party is taken to have greater moral awareness than the other;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j31/moral-hierarchy.asp Moral hierarchy] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20081122224253/http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j31/moral-hierarchy.asp |date=2008-11-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or to the beneficial hierarchy of parent/child or doctor/patient.&lt;ref&gt;Claude Steiner, in ''The Radical Therapist'' (1974) p. 40-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kohlberg==

[[Kohlberg's stages of moral development]] have been read as creating a hierarchy of increasing moral complexity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://brianwilliamson.id.au/cit/level1/psych1/kohlberg.pdf Society and the Highest Stage of Moral Development]&lt;/ref&gt; ranging from the premoral at the bottom, through the midrange of conventionalism, up to the apex of self-selected morality.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Loevinger, ''Ego Development'' (1976) p. 119-20&lt;/ref&gt;

In similar fashion, [[Robin Skynner]] viewed moral ideas (such as the 'myths' of [[Charis Katakis]]) as being interpretable at different levels, depending on the degree of mental health attained;&lt;ref&gt;R. Skynner/J. Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (1994) p. 247-54&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Eric Berne]] saw the three [[Transactional analysis#Key ideas|ego states]] of Parent/Adult/Child as falling naturally into a moral hierarchy universally respected in both time and place.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Transactional Analysis in Psychotherapy'' (1961) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dante==

[[Dante]]'s universe was structured in a hierarchy of moral sins and moral virtues,&lt;ref&gt;G. S. Jackson, ''The Word and its Witness'' (1999) p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; the stratified circles of Hell reaching down for example from the self-indulgent sins at the higher levels, to those of violence below, and the fraudulent at the bottom.&lt;ref&gt;Dante, ''Hell'' (1975) p. 75 and p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confucianism==

The [[Confucius|Confucian]] concept of a moral hierarchy traditionally served as a check on arbitrary power in China.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Levinson, ''Confucian China and its Modern Fate'' 2 (1965) p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably at least, the concept of a moral hierarchy still influences China's view of its place in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;Z &amp; S Shih, ''China's Just World'' (1993) p. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Critics charge that the notion of a moral hierarchy is untenable in cases spanning multiple cultures, because moral codes are not equal but different, and therefore there is no way of showing that certain codes are [[Morality|superior]] to others.

Proponents of Kohlberg argue against such a relativistic view of morality, however, by pointing to cross-cultural evidence from more than 30 societies supporting the concept of a hierarchy of levels of moral complexity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brianwilliamson.id.au/cit/level1/psych1/kohlberg.pdf Society...]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Natural Capital graphic.jpg|thumb|The many components of natural capital can be viewed as providing essential goods and [[ecosystem services]] which underpin some of our key [[global issue]]s, such as food and water supply, minimising climate change and meeting energy needs.]]

'''Natural capital''' is the world's stock of [[natural resource]]s, which includes geology, soils, air, water and all living organisms. Some natural capital assets provide people with free goods and services, often called [[ecosystem services]]. Two of these (clean water and fertile soil) underpin our economy and society and make human life possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is natural capital?|url=http://naturalcapitalforum.com/about/|website=naturalcapitalforum.com|publisher=World Forum on Natural Capital|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Natural Capital|url=http://www.naturalcapitalcoalition.org/why-natural-capital/natural-capital.html|website=www.naturalcapitalcoalition.org|publisher=Natural Capital Coalition|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an extension of the economic notion of [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (resources which enable the production of more resources) to goods and services provided by the natural environment. For example, a well-maintained forest or river may provide an indefinitely sustainable flow of new trees or fish, whereas over-use of those resources may lead to a permanent decline in timber availability or fish stocks. Natural capital also provides people with essential services, like water catchment, erosion control and crop pollination by insects, which in turn ensure the long-term viability of other natural resources. Since the continuous supply of services from the available natural capital assets is dependent upon a healthy, functioning environment, the structure and diversity of habitats and ecosystems are important components of natural capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Natural_capital|title=Search - The Encyclopedia of Earth|website=www.eoearth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods, called 'natural capital asset checks', help decision-makers understand how changes in the current and future performance of natural capital assets will impact on human well-being and the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UK NEAFO Work Package 1: Natural capital asset check – Annex 4: Case studies|url=http://uknea.unep-wcmc.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=dNp%2bvIjmXi4%3d&amp;tabid=82|website=uknea.unep-wcmc.org|publisher=UK National Ecosystem Assessment|accessdate=31 December 2015|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
{{Ecological economics|Concepts}}
Natural capital is one approach to [[ecosystem valuation]] which revolves around the idea, in contrast to traditional economics, that non-human life produces essential resources. Thus, ecological health is essential to the sustainability of the economy. In ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hawken|first=Paul |author2=Amory Lovins |author3=Hunter Lovins |title=Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; the author claims that the global economy is within a larger economy of natural resources and ecosystem services that sustain us. In order to continue to reap the benefits of our natural environment, we need to recognize the importance of natural capital within the economy. According to the authors, the "next industrial revolution" depends on the espousal of four central strategies: "the conservation of resources through more effective [[manufacturing]] processes, the reuse of materials as found in natural systems, a change in values from quantity to quality, and investing in natural capital, or restoring and sustaining [[natural resources]]."&lt;ref name=nat&gt;[http://www.socialfunds.com/news/print.cgi?sfArticleId=164 Book Review: Natural Capitalism] from [http://www.socialRoth2014funds.com/ Socialfunds.com]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Retrieved April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a traditional economic analysis of the factors of production, natural capital would usually be classified as "land" distinct from traditional "capital". The historical distinction between "land" and "capital" defined “land” as naturally occurring with a fixed supply, whereas “capital”, as originally defined referred only to man-made goods. (e.g., [[Georgism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henrygeorge.org/pchp2.htm] - ''[[Progress and Poverty]]'' by [[Henry George]], Chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.henrygeorge.org/def2.htm|title=Economic Definitions|website=www.henrygeorge.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) It is however, misleading to view "land" as if its productive capacity is fixed, because natural capital can be improved or degraded by the actions of man over time (see [[Tragedy of the Commons]]). Moreover, natural capital yields benefits and goods, such as timber or food, which can be harvested by humans. These benefits are similar to those realized by owners of infrastructural capital which yields more goods, such as a factory which produces automobiles just as an apple tree produces apples.

The term 'natural capital' was first used in 1973 by [[E.F. Schumacher]] in his book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schumacher|first=E.F |title=Small is Beautiful:  A Study of Economics As If People Mattered|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is closely identified with [[Herman Daly]], [[Robert Costanza]], the [[Biosphere 2]] project, and the [[Natural Capitalism]] economic model of [[Paul Hawken]], [[Amory Lovins]], and [[Hunter Lovins]]. Recently, it has begun to be used by politicians, notably Ralph Nader, Paul Martin Jr., and agencies of the UK government, including its [[Natural Capital Committee]] and the London Health Observatory. All users of the term currently differentiate natural from man-made or infrastructural capital in some way. Indicators adopted by United Nations Environment Programme's [[World Conservation Monitoring Centre]] and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) to measure natural biodiversity use the term in a slightly more specific way. According to the OECD, natural capital is “natural assets in their role of providing natural resource inputs and environmental services for economic production” and is “generally considered to comprise three principal categories: natural resources stocks, land, and ecosystems.”

Within the international community the basic principle is not controversial, although much uncertainty exists over how best to value different aspects of ecological health, natural capital and ecosystem services. [[Environmental full-cost accounting|Full-cost accounting]], triple bottom line, measuring well-being and other proposals for accounting reform often include suggestions to measure an "ecological deficit" or "natural deficit" alongside a social and financial deficit. It is difficult to measure such a deficit without some agreement on methods of valuation and auditing of at least the global forms of natural capital (e.g. value of air, water, soil).{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Ecologists are teaming up with economists to measure and express values of the wealth of ecosystems as a way of finding solutions to the biodiversity crisis.&lt;ref name="Edwards98"&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Edwards |first = P.

==Natural capital declaration==
In June 2012 a 'natural capital declaration' (NCD) was launched at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20]] summit held in Brazil. An initiative of the global finance sector, it was signed by 40 [[Chief executive officer|CEOs]] to 'integrate natural capital considerations into loans, equity, fixed income and insurance products, as well as in accounting, disclosure and reporting frameworks.' They worked with supporting organisations to develop tools and metrics to integrate natural capital factors into existing business structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Declaration|url=http://www.naturalcapitaldeclaration.org/the-declaration/|website=www.naturalcapitaldeclaration.org|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, its four key aims are to:
*Increase understanding of business dependency on natural capital assets;
*Support development of tools to integrate natural capital considerations into the decision-making process of all financial products and services;
*Help build a global consensus on integrating natural capital into private sector accounting and decision-making;
*Encourage a consensus on [[integrated reporting]] to include natural capital as one of the key components of an organisation's success.

==Natural Capital Protocol==
In July 2016, the Natural Capital Coalition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/wp-admin/|title=Log In ‹ Natural Capital Coalition — WordPress|website=naturalcapitalcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; released the Natural Capital Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/protocol/|title=Natural Capital Coalition - Protocol|website=naturalcapitalcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Protocol provides a standardised framework for organisations to identify, measure and value their direct and indirect impacts and dependencies on natural capital. The Protocol harmonises existing tools and methodologies, and guides organisations towards the information they need to make strategic and operational decisions that include impacts and dependencies on natural capital.

The Protocol was developed in a unique collaboration between 38 organisations who signed voluntary, pre-competitive contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalcapitalcoalition.org/protocol/development/|title=Natural Capital Coalition - Protocol Development|website=naturalcapitalcoalition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Protocol is available on a creative commons license and is free for organisations to apply.

==Internationally agreed standard==
Environmental-economic accounts provide the conceptual framework for integrated statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy, including the impacts of the economy on the environment and the contribution of the environment to the economy. A coherent set of indicators and descriptive statistics can be derived from the accounts that inform a wide range of policies, including, but not limited to, [[green economy]]/[[green growth]], [[natural resource management]] and [[sustainable development]]. The '''System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA)''' contains the internationally agreed standard concepts, definitions, classifications, accounting rules and tables for producing internationally comparable statistics on the environment and its relationship with the economy. The SEEA is a flexible system in the sense that its implementation can be adapted to countries' specific situations and priorities. Coordination of the implementation of the SEEA and on-going work on new methodological developments is managed and supervised by the UN Committee of Experts on Environmental-Economic Accounting (UNCEEA). The final, official version of the SEEA Central Framework was published in February 2014.

==Criticism==
Whilst measuring the components of natural capital in any region is a relatively straightforward process, both the task and the rationale of putting a monetary valuation on them, or on the value of the goods and services they freely give us, has proved more contentious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conniff|first1=Richard|title=What’s Wrong with Putting a Price on Nature?|url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/ecosystem_services_whats_wrong_with_putting_a_price_on_nature/2583/|website=e360.yale.edu|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=5 January 2016|date=18 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Within the UK, [[The Guardian|Guardian]] columnist, [[George Monbiot]], has been critical of the work of the government's [[Natural Capital Committee]] and of other attempts to place any sort of monetary value on natural capital assets, or on the free [[ecosystem services]] they provide us with. In a speech referring to a report to government which suggested that better protection of the UK's freshwater ecosystems would yield an enhancement in aesthetic value of £700m, he derided attempts 'to compare things which cannot be directly compared'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monbiot|first1=George|title=Put a price on nature? We must stop this neoliberal road to ruin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2014/jul/24/price-nature-neoliberal-capital-road-ruin|accessdate=5 January 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say:
{{Quote|text=These figures, ladies and gentlemen, are marmalade. They are finely shredded, boiled to a pulp, heavily sweetened ... and still indigestible. In other words they are total gibberish.|author=G. Monbiot}}
Others have defended efforts to integrate the valuation of natural capital into local and national economic decision-making, arguing that it puts the environment on a more balanced footing when weighed against other commercial pressures, and that 'valuation' of those assets is not the same as [[monetisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paddison|first1=Laura|title=Is natural capital a 'neoliberal road to ruin'?- experts discuss|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/natural-capital-neoliberal-road-ruin-george-monbiot-experts-debate|accessdate=5 January 2016|publisher=The Guardian|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital (Does putting a value on natural capital mean it will be 'sold off'?)|url=http://www.naturalcapitalcommittee.org/natural-capital.html|website=www.naturalcapitalcommittee.org|publisher=Natural Capital Committee|accessdate=5 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113030316/http://www.naturalcapitalcommittee.org/natural-capital.html|archivedate=13 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20797">'''Naïve cynicism''' is a [[philosophy of mind]], [[cognitive bias]] and form of [[psychological egoism]] that occurs when people naïvely expect more [[egocentric bias]] in others than actually is the case.

[[File:Naive Cynicism Flow Chart.jpg|thumb|right|Flow chart of naïve cynicism]]

The term was formally proposed by [[Justin Kruger]] and [[Thomas Gilovich]] and has been studied across a wide range of contexts including: [[negotiation]]s,&lt;ref name ="Tsay 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsay|first1=Chia-Jung|last2=Shu|first2=Lisa L.|last3=Bazerman|first3=Max H.|title=Naïveté and Cynicism in Negotiations and Other Competitive Contexts|journal=The Academy of Management Annals|date=2011|volume=5|issue=1|pages=495–518|doi=10.1080/19416520.2011.587283}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ingroups and outgroups|group-membership]],&lt;ref name="Kruger 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruger|first1=Justin|last2=Gilovich|first2=Thomas|title='Naive cynicism' in everyday theories of responsibility assessment: On biased assumptions of bias.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1999|volume=76|issue=5|pages=743–753|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.76.5.743}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[marriage]],&lt;ref name="Kruger 1999" /&gt; [[economics]],&lt;ref name="Heath 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heath|first1=Joseph|title=Business ethics without stakeholders|journal=Business Ethics Quarterly|volume=16|issue=4|pages=533–557|url=http://benjaminferguson.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Heath-2006-Business-Ethics-Quarterly.pdf|doi=10.5840/beq200616448|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[public policy|government policy]]&lt;ref name="Benforado 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benforado|first1=Adam|last2=Hanson|first2=Jon|title=Naïve Cynicism: Maintaining False Perceptions in Policy Debates|journal=Emory Law Journal|date=2008|volume=57|issue=3|page=535|ssrn=1106690}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more.

==History==

===Early examples from social psychology (1949)===
The idea that people naïvely believe they see things objectively and others do not has been acknowledged for quite some time in the field of [[social psychology]]. For example, while studying social cognition, [[Solomon Asch]] and [[Gustav Ichheiser]] wrote in 1949:

:"[W]e tend to resolve our perplexity arising out of the experience that other people see the world differently than we see it ourselves by declaring that those others, in consequence of some basic intellectual and moral defect, are unable to see the things “as they really are” and to react to them “in a normal way.” We thus imply, of course, that things are in fact as we see them and that our ways are the normal ways."&lt;ref name="Ichheiser"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ichheiser|first1=Gustav|title=Misunderstandings in Human Relations: A Study in False Social Perception|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=1949|volume=55|issue=2|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1950-01772-001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formal laboratory experimentation (1999)===
The formal proposal of naïve cynicism came from Kruger and Gilovich's 1999 study called "'Naive cynicism' in everyday theories of responsibility assessment: On biased assumptions of bias".&lt;ref name="Kruger 1999" /&gt;

==Theory==
The theory of naïve cynicism can be described as:
# I am not [[bias]]ed.
# You are [[bias]]ed if you disagree with me.
# Your intentions/actions reflect your underlying egocentric [[bias]]es.

===A counter to naïve realism ===
As with [[naïve realism]], the theory of naïve cynicism hinges on the acceptance of the following three [[beliefs]]:
# I am not [[bias]]ed.
# Reasonable people are not [[bias]]ed.
# All others are [[bias]]ed.

Naïve cynicism can be thought of as the counter to [[naïve realism (psychology)|naïve realism]], which is the belief that an individual perceives the social world objectively while others perceive it subjectively.&lt;ref name="Baumeister 2007" /&gt;
 
It is important to discern that naïve cynicism is related to the notion that others have an egocentric bias that motivates them to do things for their own self-interest rather than for altruistic reasons.

Both of these theories, however, relate to the extent that adults credit or discredit the beliefs or statements of others.&lt;ref name="Miller 1999"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Miller |first1=Dale |title=The norm of self-interest |journal=American Psychologist |date=December 1999 |volume=54 |issue=12 |pages=1053–1060 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.54.12.1053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relating to psychological egoism===
[[Psychological egoism]] is the belief that humans are always motivated by self-interest.

In a related quote, [[Joel Feinberg]], in his 1958 paper ''"Psychological Egoism"'', embraces a similar critique by drawing attention to the infinite regress of psychological egoism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;"All men desire only satisfaction."
"Satisfaction of what?"
"Satisfaction of their desires."
"Their desires for what?"
"Their desires for satisfaction."
"Satisfaction of what?"
"Their desires."
"For what?"
"For satisfaction"—etc., ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref name="Feinberg 2008"&gt;[[Joel Feinberg|Feinberg, Joel]]. "Psychological Egoism." In ''Reason &amp; Responsibility: Readings in Some Basic Problems of Philosophy'', edited by Joel Feinberg and [[Russ Shafer-Landau]], 520-532. [[California]]: [[The Thomson Corporation|Thomson Wadsworth]], [[2008 in literature|2008]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[circular reasoning]] evidenced by Feinberg's quote exemplifies how this view can be thought of as the need for others to have incessant personal desires and satisfaction.

==Definition==
There are several ways to define naïve cynicism such as:
* The tendency to expect others’ judgments will have a motivational bias and therefore will be biased in the direction of their self-interest.&lt;ref name="Baumeister 2007"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Baumeister |editor1-first=Roy |editor2-last=Vohs |editor2-first=Kathleen |title=Encyclopedia of Social Psychology |date=August 29, 2007 |publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc. |isbn=978-1-4129-1670-7 |page=601}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Expecting that others are motivationally biased when determining responsibility for positive and negative outcomes.
*The propensity to believe that others are prone to committing the [[fundamental attribution error]],  [[false consensus effect]] or [[self-enhancement]] [[bias]].&lt;ref name="Baumeister 2007" /&gt;
*When our assumptions of others' [[bias]]es exceed their actual [[bias]]es.

==Examples==

===Historical examples===

====Cold War====
The American reaction to a Russian [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT]] treaty during the [[Cold War]] is one well-known example of naïve cynicism in history. Political leaders negotiating on behalf of the United States discredited the offer simply because it was proposed by the Russian side.&lt;ref name="Tsay 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ross|first1=Lee|last2=Stillinger|first2=Constance|title=Barriers to Conflict Resolution|journal=Negotiation Journal|date=1991|volume=7|issue=4|pages=389–404|doi=10.1111/j.1571-9979.1991.tb00634.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former U.S. congressman Floyd Spence indicates the use of naïve cynicism in this quote:
:"I have had a philosophy for some time in regard to SALT, and it goes like this: the Russians will not accept a SALT treaty that is not in their best interest, and it seems to me that if it is their best interests, it can‘t be in our best interest."&lt;ref name="Ross 1991" /&gt;

===Marketplace===
Consumers exhibit naïve cynicism toward commercial companies and advertisers through suspicion and awareness toward marketing strategies used by such companies.&lt;ref name="Friest"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friest|first1=Marian|last2=Wright|first2=Peter|title=The Persuasion Knowledge Model: How People Cope with Persuasion Attempts|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=June 1994|volume=21|issue=1|pages=1–31|jstor=2489738|doi=10.1086/209380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
The public displays naïve cynicism toward governments and political leaders through distrust.&lt;ref name="Jamieson"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jamieson|first1=Kathleen|title=Setting the Record Straight Do Ad Watches Help or Hurt?|journal=The International Journal of Press/Politics|date=January 1997|volume=2|issue=1|pages=13–22|url=http://hij.sagepub.com/content/2/1/13.short|doi=10.1177/1081180x97002001003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Workplace===
Employees of large business organizations frequently exhibit naïve cynicism toward their companies and executives in the workplace through [[employee cynicism]] or [[organizational cynicism]].&lt;ref name="Mirvis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mirvis|first1=Phillip|last2=Kanter|first2=Donald|title=Combatting cynicism in the workplace|journal=National Productivity Review|date=Fall 1989|volume=8|issue=4|pages=377–394|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/npr.4040080406/abstract|doi=10.1002/npr.4040080406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision-making behavior===
Naïve cynicism can be exemplified in some decision-making behaviors such as:
* '''Negotiations''' / '''Bargaining'''
* '''Economic games'''
** The Acquiring a Company Problem
** The [[Monty Hall Problem]]
* '''Competitive betting'''
** [[Auction]]s

===Other possible real-world examples===
* Overestimating the influence of financial compensation on people’s willingness to give blood. 
* If another person tends to favor himself when interpreting uncertain information, someone exhibiting naïve cynicism would believe the other person is intentionally misleading them for their own advantage.&lt;ref name="Tenbrunsel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tenbrunsel|first1=Anne|title=Trust as an Obstacle in Environmental-Economic Disputes|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|date=May 1999|volume=42|issue=8|pages=1350–1367|url=http://abs.sagepub.com/content/42/8/1350.short|doi=10.1177/00027649921954895}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Assuming that group membership has a large influence on beliefs and attitudes.&lt;ref name="Miller 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Dale|last2=Ratner|first2=Rebecca|title=The disparity between the actual and assumed power of self-interest|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1998|volume=74|issue=1|page=53|url=http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/9457775|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.1.53}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** If an individual of one political party makes an interpretation or a statement in favor of his own party and thus in accord with his self-interest, other adults discount his statement (especially if they belong to an opposing party).
*** Likewise, if that individual makes a statement against his own self-interest, adults are more likely to believe him.&lt;ref name="Murukutla"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murukutla|first1=N|last2=Armor|first2=DA|title=Illusions of objectivity in the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir.|journal=Yale University|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resulting negative outcomes==
Naïve cynicism can contribute to several negative outcomes including:

* Over-thinking the actions of others.
* Making negative attributions about others' motivations without sufficient cause.
* Missing opportunities that greater trust might capture.

==Reducing==
The major strategy to attenuate naïve cynicism in individuals has been shown by:

* Viewing the other person as part of one's in-group or acknowledging they are working in cooperation.

As a result of applying this strategy, happier married couples were less likely to exhibit cynical beliefs about each other’s judgments.&lt;ref name="Kruger 1999" /&gt;

Individuals are especially likely to exhibit naïve cynicism when the other person has a vested interest in the judgment at hand. However, if the other person is dispassionate about the judgment at hand, the individual will be less likely to engage in naïve cynicism and think the other person will see things the way they do.&lt;ref name="Kruger 1999" /&gt;

==Psychological contexts==
Naïve cynicism may play a major role in these psychology-related contexts:

===Groups===
In one series of classic experiments by Kruger and Gilovich, groups including video game players, darts players and debaters were asked how often they were responsible for good or bad events relative to their partner. Participants evenly apportioned themselves for both good and bad events, but expected their partner to claim more responsibility for good events than bad events ([[egocentric bias]]) than they actually did.&lt;ref name="Kruger 1999" /&gt;

===Marriage===
In the same study conducted by Kruger and Gilovich, married couples were also examined and ultimately exhibited the same type of naïve cynicism about their marriage partner as did partners of dart players, video game players and debaters.&lt;ref name="Kruger 1999" /&gt;

===Altruism===
Naïve cynicism has been exemplified in the context of altruism. Explanations of selfless human behavior have been described in terms of individuals seeking personal advantage as opposed to absolute [[altruism]].&lt;ref name="Boyd"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=Robert|last2=Peter|first2=Richerson|title=Solving the puzzle of human cooperation|journal=Evolution and culture|date=2005|pages=105–132|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.334.6027&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, naïve cynicism would explain the act of an individual donating money or items to charity as a way of self-enhancement rather than for altruistic purposes.

===Dispositionists vs. situationists===
[[Dispositionist]]s are described as individuals who believe people's actions are conditioned by some internal factor, such as beliefs, values, personality traits or abilities, rather than the situation they find themselves in.

Situationists, in contrast, are described as individuals who believe people's actions are conditioned by external factors outside of one's control.

[[Dispositionist]]s exemplify naïve cynicism while situationists do not.&lt;ref name="Chiu 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiu|first1=Chi-yue|last2=Hong|first2=Ying-yi|title=Lay Dispositionism and Implicit Theories of Personality|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1997|volume=73|issue=1|pages=19–30|url=https://psychology.stanford.edu/sites/all/files/Lay%20Dispositionism%20and%20Implicit%20Theories%20of%20Personality_0.pdf|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, situationist attributions are often thought to be more accurate than dispositionist attributions. However, dispositionist attributions are commonly believed to be the dominant schema because situationist attributions tend to be dismissed or attacked.

In a direct quote from Benforado and Hanson's paper titled ''"Naïve Cynicism: Maintaining False Perceptions in Policy Debates"'', the situationist and dispositionist are described as:

:"...the naïve cynic is a self-aware—even proud—critic. 
:She speaks what she believes to be the truth, though it may require disparaging her opponents. 
:She senses that she is delving below the surface of the complex arguments of the situationists; she “sees,” for example, the financial interest, the prejudice, or the distorting zealotry that motivates the situationist. 
:She “sees” the bias and self-interest in those who would disagree—while maintaining an affirming view of herself as objective and other-regarding. 
:The naïve cynic, then, is a dispositionist who cynically dispositionalizes the situationist. :She protects fundamentally flawed attributions by attacking the sources of potentially more accurate attributions. 
:The naïve cynic understands (though rarely consciously) that [[the best defense is a good offense]]."&lt;ref name="Benforado 2008" /&gt;

====Examples of differences====
* [[Dispositionist]]s might explain bankruptcy as the largely self-inflicted result of personal laziness and/or imprudence.
* Situationists might explain bankruptcy as frequently caused by more complicated external forces, such as divorce or the medical and other costs of unanticipated illness.&lt;ref name="Norton 2008"&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton|first=Helen|title=Situationism v. Dispositionism|url=http://prawfsblawg.blogs.com/prawfsblawg/2008/05/post1.html|work=article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied contexts==
In addition to purely psychological contexts, naïve cynicism may play a major role in several applied contexts such as:

===Negotiations===
Naïve cynicism has been studied extensively in several contexts of negotiating such as bargaining tactics, specifically in the sense that too much naïve cynicism can be costly.&lt;ref name="Tsay 2011" /&gt;

Negotiators displaying naïve cynicism rely on distributive and competitive strategies and focus on gaining concessions rather than on problem-solving. This can be detrimental and lead to reduced information exchange, information concealment, coordination, cooperation and quality of information revealed.&lt;ref name="Tsay 2011" /&gt;

====Reducing naïve cynicism in negotiations====
The following strategies have been identified as ways to reduce naïve cynicism in the context of negotiations:

=====Perspective taking=====

It has been shown that individuals who focus more on the perspectives of their opponents were more successful in experimental laboratory negotiations.

Taking another person's perspective produced better predictions of opponents' goals and biases, though it is noted that many individuals lack the ability to properly change perspectives. These incapable individuals tend to view their opponents as passive and can be prone to ignore valuable information disseminated during negotiations.&lt;ref name="Neale"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neale|first1=Margaret|last2=Bazerman|first2=Max|title=The Role of Perspective-Taking Ability in Negotiating under Different Forms of Arbitration|journal=ILR Review|date=April 1983|volume=36|issue=3|pages=378–388|url=http://ilr.sagepub.com/content/36/3/378.short|doi=10.1177/001979398303600304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiator [[role reversal]] is believed to be an important focus of training for individuals to be less inclined to use naïve cynicism during negotiations. This process involves having each negotiator verbally consider their opponents perspective prior to making any judgements.&lt;ref name="Pruitt"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pruitt|first1=Dean|title=Strategy in negotiation|date=1991|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Communication=====

It has been shown when [[communication]] between opponents in negotiations is strong, negotiators are more likely to avoid stalemates.&lt;ref name="Bazerman 1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bazerman|first1=Max|title=Can negotiators outperform game theory|date=1998|pages=79–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiators who exhibit strong communication skills tend to believe integrity should be reciprocally displayed by both sides and thus regard open communication as a positive aspect in negotiations. Those negotiators high in communication skills also tend to view deadlocks as a negative event and will avoid reaching an impasse in order to reach an agreement.&lt;ref name="Bazerman 1998" /&gt;

=====Feedback=====

Despite attempts to reduce errors of naïve cynicism in laboratory studies with [[corrective feedback|error-related feedback]], errors still persisted even after many trials and strong feedback.&lt;ref name="Grosskopf"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grosskopf|first1=Brit|last2=Bereby-Meyer|first2=Yoella|last3=Bazerman|first3=Max|title=On the robustness of the winner’s curse phenomenon|journal=Theory and Decision|date=2007|volume=63|issue=4|pages=389–418|doi=10.1007/s11238-007-9034-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11238-007-9034-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governmental policy debates===
In relation to governmental policy debates, it is hypothesized that naïve cynicism fosters a distrust of other political parties and entities. Naïve cynicism is thought to be a critical contributor for why certain legal policies succeed and others fail.

For example, naïve cynicism is thought to be a factor contributing to the existence of [[Administrative detention|detention center]]s such as [[Baghdad Central Prison|Abu Ghraib]], [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]], [[Parwan Detention Facility|Bagram Air Base]] and more.&lt;ref name="Benforado 2008" /&gt;

==Related biases==
Biases including the following have been argued to be caused at least partially by naïve cynicism:

* [[Negativity bias]]
* [[Fundamental attribution error]]
* [[False-consensus effect]]
* [[Bias blind spot]]
* [[Self-interest]]
* [[Curse of knowledge]]
* [[Hindsight bias]]
* [[Hostile media effect]]
* [[Attitude polarization]]
* [[Reactive devaluation]]
* [[Empathy gap]]s
* Some forms of [[confirmation bias]]

The '''No Show Museum''' is an [[art museum]], established in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] in 2015, devoted to [[nothing]] and its various manifestations throughout the [[history of art]]. It claims to be the first of its kind.&lt;ref&gt;cf.: Art in Berlin: "[http://www.art-in-berlin.de/incbmeld.php?id=3672 Dem Nichts Raum geben]"&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by Swiss conceptual artist and curator [[Andreas Heusser]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.andreasheusser.com/ | title=Andreas Heusser }}&lt;/ref&gt; the museum's collection today includes around 500 works and documents from over 150 international artists of the 20th and 21st centuries.

==Virtual collection==
The museum's collection is freely accessible online and displays works, documents, and artifacts from conceptual art, minimalist art, performance art, and painting, as well as from photography, literature, theatre,  film, and music. In all, the collection extends over four  ours, each with two wings, and with various tracts that are thematically dedicated to different way of approaching nothing:
* Nothing as Refusal: The Art of Doing Nothing
* Nothing as Annihilation: The Art of Destruction
* Nothing as Emptiness: The Art of Absence
* Nothing as Invisibility: The Art of The Imperceptible, The Unseen, and The Hidden 
* Nothing as Reduction: The Art of Minimalism
* Nothing as Lacuna: The Art of Omission
* Nothing as Statement: The Art of Saying Nothing Nothing as Notion: The Art of Pure Imagination

The museum also provides background information in German, Spanish and English about all the works and artists. In addition, there is library that provides texts, publications, and exhibition catalogues for further research on nothing in art and other disciplines (philosophy, science, literature, music, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Nana Adusei-Poku: [http://www.e-flux.com/journal/80/101727/on-being-present-where-you-wish-to-disappear/ On Being Present Where You Wish to Disappear]. In: Journal #80 - March 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile museum==
=== Converted bus ===
Since 2015, the No Show Museum has been on a world tour with a converted bus. Inside, the mobile museum is a futuristic white cube (4 m long, 2 m wide, 2.10 m high), in which the current special exhibition is shown. It also offers access to the virtual collection via ipad stations and houses the museum shop with a limited selection of souvenirs such as the BUY NOTHING CARD® (personal credit card to buy nothing) or ART FREE AIR® (medicine for allergy sufferers). The matt black painted exterior of the bus serves as a moving blackboard, which can be labeled with announcements and information about the current exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Ana Laura B. Villalta: [http://americanosfera.org/2017/11/museo-de-la-nada-en-marte/ Museo de la Nada en MARTE]. Americanosfera, 16.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Thematic special exhibitions ===
The special exhibitions in the Mobile Museum each illuminate certain aspects, variants and themes of nothingness in art: '' INVISIBLE ARTWORKS '' (2015) presented 24 intangible and invisible works of conceptual art. The show '' NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE ''(2016) focused on works of art that do not exist and can not possibly exist (eg because it simply exceeds the possibilities of producing the artwork, or because trying to realize it leads to unsolvable conceptual and logical contradictions.) The special exhibition '' ¡NO FALTA NADA! '' (2017) was about the art of nothing as an absence, eg because the artwork has been lost or irrevocably destroyed, or because it has never existed.&lt;ref&gt;Arnulfo Agüero: [https://www.laprensa.com.ni/2017/12/11/cultura/2345136-viaje-espectacular-del-arte-las-regiones-la-nada Un viaje espectacular del arte a las regiones de la nada]. La Prensa, 12.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nothing world tour==
The No Show Museum has committed itself to the mission to spread nothing all over the globe. For this reason, the museum is touring year after year from continent to continent.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrix Dargel: [http://www.deutsches-museum.de/fileadmin/Content/010_DM/060_Verlag/060_KuT/2018/KT1-2018/Dargel.pdf Nichts zu sehen!] In: Deutsches Museum (Ed.): Kultur &amp; Technik. Nichts, Edition 1/2018. Munich.&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage of the World Tour started in Zurich in July 2015 and led through 20 countries of Central and Northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Carina Pérez: [http://www.nvinoticias.com/nota/76607/llega-el-no-show-museum-al-maco Llega el No Show Museum al MACO]. NVI Noticias, 18.11.2017&lt;/ref&gt; It included around 30 exhibitions in [[museums]] and empty [[Art museum|galleries]] in [[public spaces]] and remote areas.&lt;ref&gt;See: Documentation on [http://www.facebook.com/noshowmuseum www.facebook.com/noshowmuseum] or on [http://www.noshowmuseum.com www.noshowmuseum.com], section "Archive/Past Exhibitions"&lt;/ref&gt; The tour ended in October 2015 with an exhibition and presentation of nothing in [[Venice]] where the No Show Museum was invited by Pro Helvetia's Salon Suisse as an official participant of the [[Biennale di Venezia|56th Art Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Juri; Zweifel, Stefan: "[https://biennials.ch/home/EventDetail.aspx?EventId=73 Pro Helvetia's platform to present the Swiss contributions to the Venice Biennials]"&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2016, the mobile museum was shipped from Europe to America with the mission to spread nothing in the New World: The 80-day exhibition tour led from New York to Canada, then to the West Coast of the U.S., and finally down to Baja California Sur, Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Yale University Radio WYBCX: [http://museumofnonvisibleart.com/interviews/andreas-heusser/ The Art World Demystified]. Hosted by Brainard Carey&lt;/ref&gt;
The third stage took place from November 2017 to January 2018 and led from Baja California in Mexico through the countries of Central America (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama) to Colombia, with numerous exhibitions in public space and in collaboration with museums and local galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Jaime Moreno: [https://elperiodico.com.gt/oculta/2017/11/28/el-arte-en-la-ausencia/ El arte en la ausencia].

==Conceptual background==

===Nothing as an aesthetic category ===
In the course of the 20th century, [[nothing]] has become as distinctive an aesthetic category as “the beautiful”, “the ugly” or "the absurd".&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lucy R. Lippard, Six Years: "The Dematerialization of the Art Object from 1966 to 1972". New York, Praeger, 1973, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The artistic examination of the (non) [[phenomenon]] "nothing" has led artists and critics to question the traditional practices of art production and open up new possibilities of spatial, temporal and material interpretation. Nothing is usually understood as the [[negation]] of being and figuration, but strictly speaking, it is impossible to define nothing.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Lütkehaus, Ludger: "Nichts", Haffmans Verlag, Zürich 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Every attempt to describe, represent or materialize nothing is doomed to fail, and it is this very fact that has inspired many artists of the [[20th century]] to work intensively with [[nothing]] and the [[paradoxes]] of its (re)presentation.
The result is a large number of artistic strategies and works on nothing.&lt;ref&gt;See the following exhibition catalogues on nothing:
* Armleder, John; Copeland, Matthieu; Le Bon, Laurent; Metzger, Gustav; Perret, MaiThu; Phillpot, Clive and Pirotte, Philippe (eds): "Voids: A Retrospective", Zürich : JRP Ringier, 2009
* Hollein, Max, Weinhart, Martina: "Nichts – Nothing", Ostfildern : Hatje Cantz, 2006
* Rugoff, Ralph: "Art about the Unseen", 1957-2012, London: Hayward Publishing, 2012
* Varnedoe, Kirk: "Pictures of Nothing. Abstract Art since Pollock", Princeton/Oxford : Princeton University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nothing as a ready-made===
Already in 1913, [[Marcel Duchamp]] demonstrated with his first [[ready-mades]] how any object can be converted into art by removing it from the sphere of ordinary life and placing it in a gallery or [[museum]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. Dorothee Fauth: "Kunstlexikon: Readymade". Hatje Cantz 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; This move from one context to another changes the way spectators view an object: in the context of art, it is no longer perceived as a mere object, but instead as placeholder of an idea or of an artistic intention. The result of such attributions is that the formerly ordinary object is transformed into a [[work of art]].
The same principle can be applied to [[nothing]], and [[nothing]] can equally acquire “the dignity of a work of art by the mere choice of the artist” (André Breton).&lt;ref&gt;Hector Olbak: "[http://www.toutfait.com/issues/issue_2/Articles/obalk.html The Unfindable Readymade]"&lt;/ref&gt; The No Show Museum is an attempt to create such an [[institutional framework]] for ensuring in the long run that nothing is art.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rts.ch/audio/la-1ere/programmes/forum/6397057-le-no-show-museum-le-musee-qui-n-a-rien-a-montrer-26-12-2014.html La musée qui n'a rien à montrer]". RTS.ch (2014-12-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The museum as a mobile art context===
Although the museum’s collection is [[virtuality|virtual]], the museum does have a physical space for presentations setup in a restored and customized post bus.  Thus, the museum provides a moving art context that can either be attached to established institutions are function autonomously.  Moreover, the mobile museum offers the opportunity to discover new regions and spaces for the contexts of nothing, and it serves as a marker to indicate any place as an exhibition area.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/bellevue/Das-Nichts-ist-unser-aller-Horizont/story/25033531 Das Nichts ist unser aller Horizont]".

In [[programming language]]s (more so [[functional programming]] languages) and [[type theory]], an '''option type''' or '''maybe type''' is a [[parametric polymorphism|polymorphic type]] that represents encapsulation of an optional value; e.g., it is used as the return type of functions which may or may not return a meaningful value when they are applied.  It consists of a constructor which either is empty (named ''None'' or ''Nothing''), or which encapsulates the original data type A (written ''Just'' A or ''Some'' A). Outside of functional programming, these are termed [[nullable type]]s.

==Names and definitions==
In different programming languages, the option type has various names and definitions.

* In [[Agda (programming language)|Agda]], it is named {{code|2=agda|Maybe}} with variants {{code|2=agda|nothing}} and {{code|2=agda|just a}}.
* In [[C++17]] it is defined as the template class {{code|2=c++|std::optional&lt;T&gt;}}.
* In [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], it is defined as {{code|2=CSharp|Nullable&lt;T&gt;}} but is generally written as {{code|2=CSharp|T?}}.
* In [[Coq]], it is defined as {{code|2=coq|1=Inductive option (A:Type) : Type := {{!}} Some : A -&gt; option A {{!}} None : option A. }}.
* In [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], it is named ''Maybe'', and defined as {{code|2=haskell|1=data Maybe a = Nothing {{!}} Just a}}.
* In [[Idris (programming language)|Idris]], it is defined as {{code|2=idris|1=data Maybe a = Nothing {{!}} Just a}}.
* In [[Java (programming language)|Java]], since version 8, it is defined as parameterized final class {{code|2=java|Optional&lt;T&gt;}}.
* In [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]], it is named {{code|2=julia|Nullable{T} }}.
* In [[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]], it is defined as {{code|2=kotlin|T?}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html |title=Null Safety - Kotlin Programming Language |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[OCaml]], it is defined as {{code|2=ocaml|1=type 'a option = None {{!}} Some of 'a}}.
* In [[Perl 6]], this is the default, but you can add a {{code|2=perl6|:D}} "smiley" to opt into a non option type.
* In [[Rust (programming language)|Rust]], it is defined as {{code|2=rust|enum Option&lt;T&gt; { None, Some(T) } }}.
* In [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], it is defined as parameterized abstract class {{code|2=scala|1='.. Option[A] = if (x == null) None else Some(x)..}}.
* In [[Standard ML]], it is defined as {{code|2=sml|1=datatype 'a option = NONE {{!}} SOME of 'a}}.
* In [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]], it is defined as {{code|2=swift|enum Optional&lt;T&gt; { case none, some(T) } }} but is generally written as {{code|2=swift|T?}}.

In [[type theory]], it may be written as: &lt;math&gt;A^{?} = A + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

In languages having [[tagged union]]s, as in most [[functional programming]] languages, option types can be expressed as the tagged union of a [[unit type]] plus the encapsulated type.

In the [[Curry-Howard correspondence]], option types are related to the [[absorption law|annihilation law]] for ∨: x∨1=1.

An option type can also be seen as a [[collection (computing)|collection]] containing either one or zero elements.

== The option monad ==
{{Further information|Monad (functional programming)#The Maybe monad}}
The option type is a [[monad (functional programming)|monad]] under these functions:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{return}\colon A \to A^{?} = a \mapsto \text{Just} \, a&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{bind}\colon A^{?} \to (A \to B^{?}) \to B^{?} = a \mapsto f \mapsto \begin{cases} \text{Nothing} &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{Nothing}\\ f \, a' &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{Just} \, a' \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
We may also describe the option monad in terms of functions ''return'', ''fmap'' and ''join'', where the latter two are given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{fmap} \colon (A \to B) \to A^{?} \to B^{?} = f \mapsto a \mapsto \begin{cases} \text{Nothing} &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{Nothing}\\ \text{Just} \, f \, a' &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{Just} \, a' \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{join} \colon {A^{?}}^{?} \to A^{?} = a \mapsto \begin{cases} \text{Nothing} &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{Nothing}\\ \text{Nothing} &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{Just} \, \text{Nothing}\\ \text{Just} \, a' &amp; \text{if} \ a = \text{Just} \, \text{Just} \, a' \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The option monad is an additive monad: it has ''Nothing'' as a zero constructor and the following function as a monadic sum:

:&lt;math&gt;\text{mplus} \colon A^{?} \to A^{?} \to A^{?} = a_1 \mapsto a_2 \mapsto \begin{cases} \text{Nothing} &amp; \text{if} \ a_1 = \text{Nothing} \land a_2 = \text{Nothing}\\ \text{Just} \, a'_2 &amp; \text{if} \ a_1 = \text{Nothing} \land a_2 = \text{Just} \, a'_2 \\ \text{Just} \, a'_1 &amp; \text{if} \ a_1 = \text{Just} \, a'_1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting structure is an [[Idempotence|idempotent]] [[monoid]].

== Examples ==

=== Scala ===
[[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] implements Option as a parameterized type, so a variable can be an Option, accessed as follows:&lt;ref name="OderskySpoon2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Martin Odersky|author2=Lex Spoon|author3=Bill Venners|title=Programming in Scala|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MFjNhTjeQKkC&amp;pg=PA283|accessdate=6 September 2011|year=2008|publisher=Artima Inc|isbn=978-0-9815316-0-1|pages=282–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="scala"&gt;
// Defining variables that are Options of type Int
val res1: Option[Int] = Some(42)
val res2: Option[Int] = None

// sample 1 :  This function uses pattern matching to deconstruct Options
def compute(opt: Option[Int]) = opt match {
  case None =&gt; "No value"
  case Some(x) =&gt; "The value is: " + x
}

// sample 2 :  This function uses monad method
def compute(opt: Option[Int]) = opt.fold("No Value")(v =&gt; "The value is:" + v )

println(compute(res1))  // The value is: 42
println(compute(res2))  // No value
&lt;/source&gt;

Two main ways to use an Option value exist. The first, not the best, is the [[pattern matching]], as in the first example. The second, the best practice, is the monad method, as in the second example. In this way, a program is safe, as it can generate no exception or error (e.g., by trying to obtain the value of an &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;/code&gt; variable that is equal to &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt;). Thus, it essentially works as a type-safe alternative to the null value.

=== OCaml ===
[[OCaml]] implements Option as a parameterized variant type.  Options are constructed and deconstructed as follows:
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;
(* Constructing options *)
let none = None
let some = Some 42

(* Deconstructing options *)
let compute opt = match opt with
  | None -&gt; "No value"
  | Some x -&gt; "The value is: " ^ string_of_int x

print_endline (compute none) (* "No value" *)
print_endline (compute some) (* "The value is: 42" *)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== F# ===
&lt;source lang="ocaml"&gt;

(* This function uses pattern matching to deconstruct Options *)
let compute = function
  | None   -&gt; "No value"
  | Some x -&gt; sprintf "The value is: %d" x

printfn "%s" (compute &lt;| Some 42)(* The value is: 42 *)
printfn "%s" (compute None)      (* No value         *)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Haskell ===
&lt;source lang="haskell"&gt;
-- This function uses pattern matching to deconstruct Maybes
compute :: Maybe Int -&gt; String
compute Nothing  = "No value"
compute (Just x) = "The value is: " ++ show x

main :: IO ()
main = do
    print $ compute (Just 42) -- The value is: 42
    print $ compute Nothing -- No value
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Swift ===
&lt;source lang="swift"&gt;
func compute(_ x: Int?) -&gt; String {
  // This function uses optional binding to deconstruct optionals
  if let y = x {
    // y is now the non-optional `Int` content of `x`, if it has any
    return "The value is: \(y)"
  } else {
    return "No value"
  }
}

print(compute(42)) // The value is: 42
print(compute(nil)) // No value
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="swift"&gt;
func compute(_ x: Int?) -&gt; String {
  // This function uses `map` to transform the optional if has a value,
  // or pass along the nil if it doesn't. If `map` results in nil,
  // the nil coalescing operator `??` sets a fall-back value of "No value"
  return x.map { unwrappedX in "The value is: \(unwrappedX)" } ?? "No value"
}

print(compute(42)) // The value is: 42
print(compute(nil)) // No value
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang="swift"&gt;
func compute(_ x: Int?) -&gt; String {
  // This function uses pattern matching to deconstruct optionals
  switch x {
  case .none: 
    return "No value"
  case .some(let y): 
    return "The value is: \(y)"
  }
}

print(compute(42)) // The value is: 42
print(compute(nil)) // No value
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="swift"&gt;
func compute(_ x: Int?) -&gt; String {
  // This function asserts that x has a value, forcefully unwraps x
  // and CRASHES if nil is encountered!
  return "The value is: \(x!)"
}

print(compute(42)) // The value is: 42
print(compute(nil)) // Crash!
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Rust ===
Rust allows using either pattern matching or optional binding to deconstruct the Option type:

&lt;source lang="rust"&gt;
fn main() {
    // This function uses pattern matching to deconstruct optionals
    fn compute(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; String {
        match x {
            Some(a) =&gt; format!("The value is: {}", a),
            None    =&gt; format!("No value")
        }
    }

    println!("{}", compute(Some(42))); // The value is: 42
    println!("{}", compute(None)); // No value
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="rust"&gt;
fn main() {
    // This function uses optional binding to deconstruct optionals
    fn compute(x: Option&lt;i32&gt;) -&gt; String {
        if let Some(a) = x {
            format!("The value is: {}", a)
        } else {
            format!("No value")
        }
    }

    println!("{}", compute(Some(42))); // The value is: 42
    println!("{}", compute(None)); // No value
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Julia ===
Julia requires explicit deconstruction to access a nullable value:

&lt;source lang="julia"&gt;
function compute(x::Nullable{Int})
    if !isnull(x)
        println("The value is: $(get(x))")
    else
        println("No value")
    end
end
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang="jlcon"&gt;
julia&gt; compute(Nullable(42))
The value is: 42
julia&gt; compute(Nullable{Int}())
No value
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Perl 6 ===
There are as many null values as there are types, that is because every type is its own null.
So all types are also their own option type.

Basically when use type in a declaration, it can be a value of that type or a null of that type.

To designate that it must have a defined value assigned to it (not be in the null state), use the {{code|2=perl6|:D}} "smiley" designation.

It is also possible to designate that it must always be a null using the {{code|2=perl6|:U}} "smiley".

&lt;hr&gt;

* '''Default Option Type Declaration:'''

&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
# no type declaration
my $a;
say defined $a; # False
# has a typed null value
say $a; # (Any)
# Note that Any is the default base class

# with a type declaration
my Int   $b;
my Int:_ $b;    # same as above
say defined $b; # False
say $b;         # (Int)
$b = 42;
say defined $b; # True
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Defined Declaration:'''

&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
# my Int:D $c;      # Error, you have to initialize it with a defined value
my Int:D $c = 0;
say defined $c;     # True
say $c.VAR.default; # (Int:D)
# $c = Nil;         # Error, the default is `Int:D` which isn't a defined value

# If you use the defined type "smiley" you may want to use `is default`
# to be able to accept a Nil. (Nil is not the same as a null in other languages)
my Int:D $d is default(10) = 0;
say $d;          # 0
$d = Nil;
say $d;          # 10

# no need to assign a value if it's the same as the default
my Int:D $e is default(10);
say $e;          # 10
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Typed Null Declaration:'''

&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
my Numeric:U $n;
$n = 1.WHAT;
say $n;          # (Int)
$n = (1/2).WHAT;
say $n;          # (Rat)
# $n = 1;        # Error, only accepts undefined values
# $n = Str;      # Error, only accepts types that do the Numeric role
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Signatures:'''

Type "smileys" are used more often for method and subroutine signatures than they are for variable declarations.

&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
proto sub is-it-defined ( Any:_ $ ) {*} # `Any:_` is the same as `Any`, only used here to line up the signatures

multi sub is-it-defined ( Any:U $ ) { 'undefined' } # a null value that is of type `Any` or a subtype
multi sub is-it-defined ( Any:D $ ) {   'defined' } # a non-null value of type `Any` or a subtype
&lt;/source&gt;

* '''Additional Syntax Relief:'''

There are special variations of {{code|2=perl6|if}} and {{code|2=perl6|unless}} called {{code|2=perl6|with}} and {{code|2=perl6|without}} that check for definedness rather than truthiness.

These set {{code|2=perl6|$_}} by default, unlike their boolean cousins.

&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
sub say-is-it-defined ( $value ) {
    # notice that these set `$_` to the argument by default, but `if` does not
    with    $value { say "$_.perl() is defined" }
    without $value { say "$_.perl() is not defined" }
}

say-is-it-defined 0;     # 0 is defined
say-is-it-defined '';    # "" is defined

say-is-it-defined Any;   # Any is not defined
say-is-it-defined my $;  # Any is not defined

my $a;
sub something-or-other { … }

# postfix variation of `with` also sets `$_`
$a = $_ with something-or-other;
# `$a` will change to the result, but only if the result was defined
&lt;/source&gt;

There are also variations of {{code|2=perl6|{{!}}{{!}}}}, {{code|2=perl6|or}} and {{code|2=perl6|and}} that test for definedness.

&lt;source lang="perl6"&gt;
say   0 // 42; # 0
say Nil // 42; # 42

# notice that these set `$_` to the left value
Nil orelse  say "$_.perl() is undefined"; # Nil is undefined
0   andthen say "$_.perl() is defined";   # 0 is defined
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12193">The '''PANOSE''' System is a method for [[Typeface#Style of typefaces|classifying]] [[typeface]]s solely on their visual characteristics, developed by [[Benjamin Bauermeister]]. It can be used to identify an unknown [[font]] from a sample image or to match a known font to its closest visual neighbor from a font pool. The word "PANOSE" is composed of letters taken from the six classes in which the creator of the system organized the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qrElYgVLDwYC&amp;pg=PA424&amp;lpg=PA424&amp;dq=Benjamin+Bauermeister+panose&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4grGp040MP&amp;sig=1H7JWLmIm18wD8gMzYy6zi3XY1o&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=zldNStT_BZ66jAeettC-BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8 Yannis Haralambous, Fonts &amp; Encodings, O'Reilly Media, 2007, p. 424.] {{ISBN|0-596-10242-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original PANOSE System was developed in 1985 by [[Benjamin Bauermeister]]. In 1988, it was published by Van Nostrand Reinhold Company Inc. under the title ''A Manual of Comparative Typography: The PANOSE System''. This initial version of the PANOSE system consisted of seven classification categories and was based on subjective visual parameters.

In 1990, the Weight category was added, and the Arm Style category was split off from the Stroke Variation category, bringing the number of classification categories to 9. Objective classification criteria were also added at this time.

In 1991, the Family Kind category was added, completing the PANOSE 1.0 definition.

In 1992, there were attempts made to classify Han ideographic typefaces, which allows applications to suggests the most appropriate Latin typeface to match a given Han ideographic typeface. Transliteral mapping could also be used to match between, for example, decorative or script faces and text equivalents.

In 1993, Mapper Application Interface (MAI) was developed. PANOSE 2.0 was also released in the same year, which is the basis for Hewlett Packard's Infinifont font synthesis technology.

PANOSE was incorporated into a variety of digital font metadata tags in 1992 by ElseWare Corporation. The classification system, its matching [[algorithm]]s reference databases, classification parameters, and trademarks were purchased by [[Hewlett Packard]] in 1995. A font synthesis engine named [[Infinifont]] was also purchased by Hewlett Packard at that time.

==Revisions==

===1.0===
It was published in 1988. A PANOSE classification number consists of 10 concatenated values. Each value from a given category was computed from a specific visual metric, such as the weight of the font and the presence or absence of serifs. Special values "Any" (0) and "No Fit" (1) exist for every category, which have specific meanings to the mapper. "Any" means match that digit with any available digit, which allows the mapper to handle distortable typefaces. "No Fit" means that the item being classified does not fit within the present system.

The standard classifies fonts in following categories in following order:
*Family: The Family value defines what type of font is being classified, which affects the valid values available for the latter categories, and the categories available. Different category definitions exist for Latin Text, Latin Hand Written, Latin Decorative, Latin Symbol, Iconographic, Japanese Text, Cyrillic Text and Hebrew.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

====Latin Text categories====
*'''Serif Style:''' it describes the appearance of the serifs used in a font design and groups them into one of 14 general categories. Serif and sans serif faces are classified within this digit.
*'''Weight:''' it classifies the appearance of a font's stem thickness in relation to its height. It offers 10 gradations, ranging from Very Light to Extra Black.
*'''Proportion:''' it describes the relative proportions of the characters in the font. Distinguishes Monospaced from Proportional, Modern from Old Style, and Extended from Condensed.
*'''Contrast:''' it describes the ratio between the thickest and narrowest points on the letter O. The uppercase O is used because it is generally of higher contrast than the other characters of the alphabet.
*'''Stroke Variation:''' it specifies the relationship between the thicknesses of the thin stems and the wide stems. It further details the contrast trait by describing the kind of transition that occurs as the stem thickness changes on rounded glyph shapes.
*'''Arm Style:''' it classifies special treatment of diagonal stems and termination of open rounded letterforms. The letter A and C are used extensively for this classification, along with G, M, S, V, W, and Y.
*'''Letterform:''' it classifies roundness of the character shapes and the predominant skewing of the character forms.
*'''Midline:''' it describes the placement of the midline across the uppercase characters and the treatment of diagonal stem apexes.
*'''X-height:''' it describes the treatment of uppercase glyphs with diacritical marks and the relative size of the lowercase characters.

====Latin Hand Written categories====

For example, the PANOSE digits for Times New Roman are:
{| class="wikitable"
|Family Kind
|'''2''' (Latin text)
|-
|Serif Style
|'''2''' (Cove)
|-
|Weight
|'''6''' (Medium)
|-
|Proportion
|'''3''' (Modern)
|-
|Contrast
|'''5''' (Medium low)
|-
|Stroke variation
|'''4''' (Transitional)
|-
|Arm style
|'''5''' (Straight arms)
|-
|Letterform
|'''2''' (Round)
|-
|Midline
|'''3''' (Standard)
|-
|X-height
|'''4''' (Large) 
|}

===2.0===
The system stores actual measurement data under the Rich Font Description (RFD) rather than bucketing it, which allows the matching system to use mathematical distance rather than penalty tables. It is designed for distortable font technologies (e.g.: Multi Master fonts). The system offers multiple methods for distortable fonts.

The original classification system was changed from a bucket-based system to an arithmetic system (except the Family from PANOSE 1.0 and derivatives), and was expanded to following categories:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!1.0!! 2.0
|-
|Family||Class, Genre
|-
|Serif Style||Serif Measure, Serif Tall Measure, Serif Tip Measure, Serif Hip Roundness, Serif Tip Roundness, Serif Angle, Serif Drop Measure, Serif Balance Measure, Serif Foot Pitch Measure, Serif Cup Measure
|-
|Weight||Weight Measure
|-
|Proportion||Monospace Flag, Distortion Measure, Ratio Measure
|-
|Contrast||Narrow Stem Measure
|-
|Stroke||Speed Factor, Stress-up Angle, Stress-low Angle
|-
|Arm Style||Stem Taper Factor, Stem Dishing Measure, Stem Bowing Measure, Stem Termination Type, Stem Termination Angle
|-
|Letterform||Slant Angle, Outer Curve Factor, Side Flat Factor, Top Flat Factor, Bowl Mid-out Measure
|-
|Midline||Mid "E" Measure, Mid "A" Measure, Apex Trim Factor, Apex Serif Flag
|-
|X-Height||X-Tall Measure, Diacritical Location
|-
|none||Cap-Scale Factor
|}
Each PANOSE 2.0 category value is a signed 16-bit number (from −32,768 to 32,767; only ranges between −10,000 and 10,000 are defined), where value zero (0) is considered to be the "normal" for the digit. For example, digit zero for the weight represents medium weight. The "any" value from PANOSE 1.0 is translated to a "don't care" parameter and is replaced by the more comprehensive distortable font descriptions.

The Family category is replaced by Class and Genre, where Class indicates a font's language and character set, where Genre indicates text faces, display faces, symbol faces, and so on. PANOSE matching software is designed to match fonts with different Class, but same Genre. The same Genre can have different meaning in different Class, so the matching heuristic decides the closeness of fonts based on adjusted values based on Class, rather than raw PANOSE values within the fonts themselves.

==PANOSE Classification Procedures==
Classification Procedures are objective measurement techniques used to assign a PANOSE number to a font.

==PANOSE Mapper software==
The PANOSE Mapper software determines the closest possible font match on any given system by comparing the PANOSE numbers of the requested and available fonts. The individual PANOSE digits are compared, weighted by their typographic importance, and summed to provide a numerical visual distance. Typographic importance is derived by assigning weights to each digit; for example, a font's weight (regular, bold, demibold, etc.) is more important than its contrast (difference between thick and thin strokes).

==Standardizations==
PANOSE 1.0 table is supported in [[TrueType]] font format.

PANOSE 2.0 is used in ElseWare Corporation's Infinifont parametric font generation system.

In 1996, during the [[W3C]]'s draft process for [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS1]], Hewlett Packard proposed a PANOSE syntax extension for [[font substitution]]. It was not included in the final CSS1 recommendation partly because of licensing concerns. Although Hewlett Packard Co. is not interested in profiting from PANOSE, it will negotiate licenses on a time and materials basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/Printing/stevahn.html PANOSE: An Ideal Typeface Matching System for the Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

PANOSE 1.0 is supported in [[SVG]] since version 1.0 in the ''font-face'' element under ''panose-1'' attribute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG10/fonts.html#FontFaceElement 20.8.3 The 'font-face' element]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[CSS2]], it is used in the ''panose-1'' property,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512/fonts.html#descdef-panose-1 15.3.6 Descriptors for Matching: 'panose-1', 'stemv', 'stemh', 'slope', 'cap-height', 'x-height', 'ascent', and 'descent']&lt;/ref&gt; which was removed in CSS2.1, and was reintroduced in ''[[CSS3]] module: Web Fonts'' specifications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-webfonts/#matching 2.6. Descriptors for Matching: 'panose-1', 'stemv', 'stemh', 'slope', 'cap-height', 'x-height', 'ascent', and 'descent']&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Office Open XML]], it is part of WordProcessingML.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.msdn.com/johnrdurant/archive/2005/08/08/wordmlpanose.aspx WordML and Panose- Yes, Panose!]&lt;/ref&gt;

PANOSE 1.0 is used in [[Rich Text Format]] Specification 1.7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.softhelp.ru/fileformat/rtf17/Word2002RTFSpecificationFinal.htm RTF Version 1.7]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[turn-based game]]s, '''permanent brain''' (also called '''pondering''') is the act of [[thought|thinking]] during the opponent's turn.  [[Chess engine|Chess engines]] that continue calculating even when it is not their turn to play end up choosing moves that are stronger than if they are barred from calculating on their opponent's turn.

== Use with chess programs ==

The strength of [[chess program]]s depends very much on the amount of time allocated for calculating. Many chess programs use pondering to improve their strength. Current programs cannot create strategic plans, so a program simply tries to predict the opponent's move and begins to calculate its response. If the opponent's move has been guessed correctly, then the program continues to calculate. If the prediction fails, the program begins a new computation.

Pondering is less effective than normal thinking. For example, if the program guesses 25% of the opponent's moves correctly, the use of pondering is on average equivalent to increasing the normal calculating time by a factor of 1.25.

In chess games between two computers, pondering makes sense only if the competing chess engines use separate [[Central processing unit|processors]] or [[Multi-core|core]]s. If they share the same core, the pondering program steals half of the time from the program thinking in the normal way and uses the stolen time less effectively. For this reason, chess [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]]s have an option to turn the permanent brain off.

:''This article discusses the history of the principle of least action. For the application, please refer to [[action (physics)]].''
The '''principle of least action''' – or, more accurately, the '''principle of stationary action''' – is a [[variational principle]] that, when applied to the [[action (physics)|action]] of a [[mechanics|mechanical]] system, can be used to obtain the [[equations of motion]] for that system. In relativity, a different action must be minimized or maximized. The principle can be used to derive [[Newtonian mechanics|Newtonian]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] [[equations of motion]], and even [[general relativity]] (see [[Einstein–Hilbert action]]). The physicist Paul Dirac&lt;ref&gt;P.A.M. Dirac, Physikalische Zeitschrift der Sowjetunion, Band 3, Heft 1, 64
(1933). A translated version can be found in; Julian S. Schwinger, Selected Papers on Electrodynamics, Dover Publications Inc.(1958), pp. 312.{{ISBN|9780883076484}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and after him Julian Schwinger and Richard Feynman, demonstrated how this principle can also be used in quantum calculations.&lt;ref&gt;R.

Benjamin Publishers (1970), {{ISBN|0738203033}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was historically called "least" because its solution requires finding the path that has the least value.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Chapter 19 of Volume II,  [[Richard Feynman|Feynman R]], [[Robert B.

The principle remains central in [[modern physics]] and [[mathematics]], being applied in [[thermodynamics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.aop.2008.04.007 |title=Thermodynamics based on the principle of least abbreviated action: Entropy production in a network of coupled oscillators |journal=Annals of Physics |volume=323 |issue=8 |pages=1844–58 |year=2008 |last1=García-Morales |first1=Vladimir |last2=Pellicer |first2=Julio |last3=Manzanares |first3=José A. |bibcode=2008AnPhy.323.1844G |arxiv=cond-mat/0602186 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fluid mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Principle_of_least_action&lt;/ref&gt; the [[theory of relativity]], [[quantum mechanics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1942PhDT.........5F |title=The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics |author1=Feynman |first1=Richard Phillips |year=1942 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[particle physics]], and [[string theory]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/LeastAction.pdf Principle of Least Action - damtp]&lt;/ref&gt; and is a focus of modern mathematical investigation in [[Morse theory]]. [[Maupertuis' principle]] and [[Hamilton's principle]] exemplify the principle of stationary action.

The action principle is preceded by earlier ideas in [[optics]]. In [[ancient Greece]], [[Euclid]] wrote in his ''Catoptrica'' that, for the path of light reflecting from a mirror, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] equals the [[angle of reflection]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[Hero of Alexandria]] later showed that this path was the shortest length and least time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Scholars often credit [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] for formulating the principle of least action because he wrote about it in 1744&lt;ref name="mau44"&gt;P.L.M. de Maupertuis, ''[[s:fr:Accord de différentes loix de la nature qui avoient jusqu’ici paru incompatibles|Accord de différentes lois de la nature qui avaient jusqu'ici paru incompatibles.]]'' (1744) Mém.

Ac. Berlin, p. 267.([[s:Derivation of the laws of motion and equilibrium from a metaphysical principle|English translation]])&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Leonhard Euler]] discussed the principle in 1744,&lt;ref name="eul44"&gt;Leonhard Euler, ''Methodus Inveniendi Lineas Curvas Maximi Minive Proprietate Gaudentes.''

It is defined as the [[integral (mathematics)|integral]] of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] ''L'' between two instants of [[time in physics|time]] ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - technically a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] of the ''N'' [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'') which define the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{q} : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}^N &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}[\mathbf{q}, t_1, t_2] 
= \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}(t),\mathbf{\dot{q}}(t), t) dt &lt;/math&gt;

where the dot denotes the [[time derivative]], and ''t'' is time.

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''δ'' (lowercase Greek [[Delta (letter)|delta]]) means a ''small'' change. In words this reads:&lt;ref name=penrose/&gt;

:''The path taken by the system between times t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and configurations q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the one for which the '''action''' is '''stationary (no change)''' to '''first order'''.''

In applications the statement and definition of action are taken together:&lt;ref&gt;Classical Mechanics, T.W.B. Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, {{ISBN|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}},t) dt = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the coordinates in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

==Origins, statements, and controversy==

===Fermat===
{{main article|Fermat's principle}}
In the 1600s, [[Pierre de Fermat]] postulated that "''light travels between two given points along the path of shortest time''," which is known as the '''principle of least time''' or '''[[Fermat's principle]]'''.&lt;ref name="Analytical Mechanics 2008"/&gt;

===Maupertuis===
{{main article|Maupertuis principle}}
Credit for the formulation of the '''principle of least action''' is commonly given to [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]], who felt that "Nature is thrifty in all its actions", and applied the principle broadly:

{{quote|The laws of movement and of rest deduced from this principle being precisely the same as those observed in nature, we can admire the application of it to all phenomena. The movement of animals, the vegetative growth of plants ... are only its consequences; and the spectacle of the universe becomes so much the grander, so much more beautiful, the worthier of its Author, when one knows that a small number of laws, most wisely established, suffice for all movements.|Pierre Louis Maupertuis&lt;ref&gt;Chris Davis. [http://www.idlex.freeserve.co.uk/idle/evolution/ref/leastact.html ''Idle theory''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615043538/http://www.idlex.freeserve.co.uk/idle/evolution/ref/leastact.html |date=2006-06-15 }} (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This notion of Maupertuis, although somewhat deterministic today, does capture much of the essence of mechanics.

In application to physics, Maupertuis suggested that the quantity to be minimized was the product of the duration (time) of movement within a system by the "[[vis viva]]",

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title='''Maupertuis' principle'''
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\delta \int 2T(t)  dt=0&lt;/math&gt;
|border=2
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

which is the integral of twice what we now call the [[kinetic energy]] ''T'' of the system.

===Euler===

[[Leonhard Euler]] gave a formulation of the action principle in 1744, in very recognizable terms, in the ''Additamentum 2'' to his ''Methodus Inveniendi Lineas Curvas Maximi Minive Proprietate Gaudentes''. Beginning with the second paragraph:

{{cquote|Let the mass of the projectile be ''M'', and let its speed be ''v'' while being moved over an infinitesimal distance ''ds''.   The body will have a momentum ''Mv'' that, when multiplied by the distance ''ds'', will give {{nowrap|''Mv'' ''ds''}}, the momentum of the body integrated over the distance ''ds''.  Now I assert that the curve thus described by the body to be the curve (from among all other curves connecting the same endpoints) that minimizes
:&lt;math&gt;\int Mv\,ds&lt;/math&gt;
or, provided that ''M'' is constant along the path,
:&lt;math&gt;M\int v\,ds&lt;/math&gt;.|20px|20px|Leonhard Euler&lt;ref name="eul44" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Euler, [[s:la:Methodus inveniendi/Additamentum II|Additamentum II]] ([http://math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/docs/originals/E065h external link]), ibid. ([[https://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Translation:Methodus_inveniendi/Additamentum_II&amp;oldid=6399338| English translation]])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Euler states, ∫''Mv''d''s'' is the integral of the momentum over distance travelled, which, in modern notation, equals the abbreviated or [[reduced action]]

{{Equation box 1
|indent =:
|title='''Euler's principle'''
|equation = &lt;math&gt;\delta\int p\,dq=0&lt;/math&gt;
|border=2
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

Thus, Euler made an equivalent and (apparently) independent statement of the variational principle in the same year as Maupertuis, albeit slightly later. Curiously, Euler did not claim any priority, as the following episode shows.

===Disputed priority===

Maupertuis' priority was disputed in 1751 by the mathematician [[Samuel König]], who claimed that it had been invented by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in 1707. Although similar to many of Leibniz's arguments, the principle itself has not been documented in Leibniz's works. König himself showed a ''copy'' of a 1707 letter from Leibniz to [[Jacob Hermann (mathematician)|Jacob Hermann]] with the principle, but the ''original'' letter has been lost. In contentious proceedings, König was accused of forgery,&lt;ref name="oco03" /&gt; and even the [[Frederick the Great|King of Prussia]] entered the debate, defending Maupertuis (the head of his Academy), while [[Voltaire]] defended König.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Euler, rather than claiming priority, was a staunch defender of Maupertuis, and Euler himself prosecuted König for forgery before the Berlin Academy on 13 April 1752.&lt;ref name="oco03" /&gt; The claims of forgery were re-examined 150 years later, and archival work by [[C.I. Gerhardt]] in 1898&lt;ref name="ger98" /&gt; and [[W. Kabitz]] in 1913&lt;ref name="kab13" /&gt; uncovered other copies of the letter, and three others cited by König, in the [[Bernoulli family|Bernoulli]] archives.

==Further development==

Euler continued to write on the topic; in his ''Reflexions sur quelques loix generales de la nature'' (1748), he called the quantity "effort". His expression corresponds to what we would now call [[potential energy]], so that his statement of least action in statics is equivalent to the principle that a system of bodies at rest will adopt a configuration that minimizes total potential energy.

===Lagrange and Hamilton===
{{main article|Hamilton's principle}}
Much of the calculus of variations was stated by [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] in 1760&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=D. J. Struik|title=A Source Book in Mathematics, 1200-1800|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass|year=1969}} pp. 406-413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kline|first=Morris|title=Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|year=1972|isbn=0-19-501496-0}} pp. 582-589&lt;/ref&gt; and he proceeded to apply this to problems in dynamics. In ''Méchanique Analytique'' (1788) Lagrange derived the general [[Lagrangian equations of motion|equations of motion]] of a mechanical body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lagrange|first=Joseph-Louis|title=Mécanique Analytique|year=1788}} p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in 1834 and 1835&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Hamilton, "On a General Method in Dynamics", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'' [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/GenMeth.pdf Part I (1834) p.247-308]; [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/SecEssay.pdf Part II (1835) p. 95-144]. (''From the collection [http://www.emis.de/classics/Hamilton/ Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865): Mathematical Papers] edited by David R. Wilkins, School of Mathematics, Trinity College, Dublin 2, Ireland. (2000); also reviewed as [http://www.maths.tcd.ie/pub/HistMath/People/Hamilton/Dynamics/ On a General Method in Dynamics]'')&lt;/ref&gt; applied the variational principle to the classical [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] [[function (mathematics)|function]]

:&lt;math&gt;L=T-V&lt;/math&gt;

to obtain the [[Euler–Lagrange equations]] in their present form.

===Jacobi and Morse===
In 1842, [[Carl Gustav Jacobi]] tackled the problem of whether the variational principle always found minima as opposed to other [[stationary points]] (maxima or stationary [[saddle points]]); most of his work focused on [[geodesics]] on two-dimensional surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;G.C.J. Jacobi, ''Vorlesungen über Dynamik, gehalten an der Universität Königsberg im Wintersemester 1842-1843''. A. Clebsch (ed.) (1866); Reimer; Berlin. 290 pages, available online [http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/cgi-bin/oeitem?id=OE_JACOBI__8_1_0  Œuvres complètes volume '''8'''] at [http://math-doc.ujf-grenoble.fr/OEUVRES/ Gallica-Math] from the [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ Gallica Bibliothèque nationale de France].&lt;/ref&gt; The first clear general statements were given by [[Marston Morse]] in the 1920s and 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;Marston Morse (1934). "The Calculus of Variations in the Large", ''American Mathematical Society Colloquium Publication'' '''18'''; New York.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to what is now known as [[Morse theory]]. For example, Morse showed that the number of [[conjugate points]] in a trajectory equalled the number of negative eigenvalues in the second variation of the Lagrangian.

===Gauss and Hertz===
Other extremal principles of [[classical mechanics]] have been formulated, such as [[Gauss's principle of least constraint]] and its corollary, [[Hertz's principle of least curvature]].

==Disputes about possible teleological aspects==

The  mathematical equivalence of the [[differential equation|differential]] [[equations of motion]] and their [[integral equation|integral]]
counterpart has important philosophical implications.  The differential equations are statements about quantities localized to a single point in space or single moment of time.  For example, [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;

states that the ''instantaneous'' force '''F''' applied to a mass ''m'' produces an acceleration '''a''' at the same ''instant''.  By  contrast, the action principle is not localized to a point; rather, it involves integrals over an interval of time and (for fields) an extended region of space.  Moreover, in the usual formulation of [[classical physics|classical]] action principles, the initial and final states of the system are fixed, e.g.,

:''Given that the particle begins at position x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at time t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ends at position x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at time t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the physical trajectory that connects these two endpoints is an [[extremum]] of the action integral.''

In particular, the fixing of the ''final'' state has been interpreted as giving the action principle a [[teleology|teleological character]] which has been controversial historically. However, according to W. Yourgrau and S. Mandelstam, ''the teleological approach... presupposes that the variational principles themselves have mathematical characteristics which they ''de facto'' do not possess''&lt;ref name="Stöltzner1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stöltzner|first=Michael|title=Inside Versus Outside: Action Principles and Teleology|year=1994|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-48649-4|pages=33–62 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-48647-0_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some critics maintain this apparent [[teleology]] occurs because of the way in which the question was asked. By specifying some but not all aspects of both the initial and final conditions (the positions but not the velocities) we are making some inferences about the initial conditions from the final conditions, and it is this "backward" inference that can be seen as a teleological explanation. Teleology can also be overcome if we consider the classical description as a limiting case of the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] formalism of [[Path integral formulation|path integration]], in which stationary paths are obtained as a result of interference of amplitudes along all possible paths.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The short story ''[[Story of Your Life]]'' by the speculative fiction writer [[Ted Chiang]] contains visual depictions of [[Fermat's Principle]] along with a discussion of its teleological dimension. [[Keith Devlin]]'s ''The Math Instinct'' contains a chapter, "Elvis the Welsh Corgi Who Can Do Calculus" that discusses the calculus "embedded" in some animals as they solve the "least time" problem in actual situations.

'''''Pāramitā''''' ([[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]]) or '''''pāramī''''' (Pāli) is "perfection" or "completeness". While, technically, ''pāramī'' and ''pāramitā'' are both Pāli terms, [[Pali literature]] makes far greater reference to ''pāramī''.

== Etymology ==
[[Donald S. Lopez, Jr.]] describes the etymology of the term:{{quote|The term ''pāramitā'', commonly translated as "perfection," has two etymologies. The first derives it from the word ''parama'', meaning "highest", "most distant", and hence "chief", "primary", "most excellent". Hence, the substantive can be rendered "excellence" or "perfection". This reading is supported by the ''[[Madhyanta-vibhaga-karika|Madhyāntavibhāga]]'' (V.4), where the twelve excellences (''parama'') are associated with the ten perfections (''pāramitā'').

A more creative yet widely reported etymology divides ''pāramitā'' into ''pāra'' and ''mita'', with ''pāra'' meaning "beyond", "the further bank, shore or boundary," and ''mita'', meaning "that which has arrived," or ''ita'' meaning "that which goes." ''Pāramitā'', then means "that which has gone beyond," "that which goes beyond," or "transcendent." This reading is reflected in the Tibetan translation ''pha rol tu phyin pa'' ("gone to the other side").{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=21}}}}

== Theravāda Buddhism ==
Theravada teachings on the ''pāramīs'' can be found in late canonical books and post-canonical [[Atthakatha|commentaries]].

=== Canonical sources ===
In the [[Pāli Canon]], the ''[[Buddhavamsa|Buddhavaṃsa]]'' lists the ten perfections (''dasa pāramiyo'') as:{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

# ''[[Dāna]] pāramī'' : generosity, giving of oneself
# ''[[Śīla|Sīla]] pāramī'' : virtue, morality, proper conduct
# ''[[Nekkhamma]] pāramī'' : renunciation
# ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Paññā]] pāramī'' : transcendental wisdom, insight
# ''[[Vīrya|Viriya]] pāramī'' : energy, diligence, vigour, effort
# ''[[Kshanti|Khanti]] pāramī'' : patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance
# ''[[Sacca]] pāramī'' : truthfulness, honesty
# ''[[Adhiṭṭhāna]] pāramī'' : determination, resolution
# ''[[Mettā]] pāramī'' : goodwill, friendliness, loving-kindness
# ''[[Upekkha|Upekkhā]] pāramī'' : equanimity, serenity

Two of the above [[virtue]]s, mettā and ''upekkhā'', also are [[brahmavihara|brahmavihāras]].

=== Historicity ===
The Theravādin teachings on the pāramīs can be found in canonical books (''[[Jataka tales]]'', ''[[Apadāna]]'', ''[[Buddhavamsa|Buddhavaṃsa]]'', ''[[Cariyapitaka|Cariyāpiṭaka]]'') and post-canonical [[Atthakatha|commentaries]] written to supplement the Pāli Canon at a later time, and thus might not be an original part of the Theravādin teachings.&lt;ref&gt;"[Prose portions of the ''Jātakas''] originally did not form part of [the Theravādins] scriptures": Nalinaksha Dutt (1978) ''Buddhist Sects in India''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition: 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regarding the ''Cariyāpiṭaka'', Horner (2000), ''Cariyāpiṭaka'' section, p. vi, writes that it is "[c]onsidered to be post-[[Asoka]]n...."&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest parts of the ''[[Sutta Pitaka|Sutta Piṭaka]]'' (for example, ''[[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima Nikāya]]'', ''[[Digha Nikaya|Digha Nikāya]]'', ''[[Samyutta Nikaya|Saṃyutta Nikāya]]'' and the ''[[Anguttara Nikaya|Aṅguttara Nikāya]]'') do not have any mention of the pāramīs as a category (though they are all mentioned individually).&lt;ref&gt;"[the Theravādins’] early literature did not refer to the pāramitās." Nalinaksha Dutt (1978) ''Buddhist Sects in India''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition: 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars even refer to the teachings of the pāramīs as a semi-Mahāyāna teaching added to the scriptures at a later time in order to appeal to the interests and needs of the lay community and to popularize their religion.&lt;ref&gt;"The incorporation of pāramis by the Theravādins in the Jātakas reveals that they were not immune from Mahāyānic influence. This happened, of course, at a much later date[.]" Nalinaksha Dutt (1978) ''Buddhist Sects in India''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition: 219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It is evident that the Hinayānists, either to popularize their religion or to interest the laity more in it, incorporated in their doctrines the conception of Bodhisattva and the practice of pāramitās. This was effected by the production of new literature: the Jātakas and Avadānas." Nalinaksha Dutt (1978) ''Buddhist Sects in India''. Motilal Banarsidass Publishers (Delhi), 2nd Edition: 251. The term "Semi-Mahāyāna" occurs here as a subtitle.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these views rely on the early scholarly presumption of Mahāyāna originating with religious devotion and appeal to laity. More recently, scholars have started to open up early Mahāyāna literature, which is very ascetic and expounds the ideal of the monk's life in the forest.&lt;ref&gt;"As scholars have moved away from this limited corpus, and have begun to explore a wider range of Mahāyāna sutras, they have stumbled on, and have started to open up, a literature that is often stridently ascetic and heavily engaged in reinventing the forest ideal, an individualistic, antisocial, ascetic ideal that is encapsulated in the apparently resurrected image of "wandering alone like a rhinoceros." ''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism'' (2004): p. 494&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the practice of the pāramitās in Buddhism is close to the ideals of the ascetic tradition of the [[śramaṇa]].

=== Traditional practice ===
Bodhi (2005) maintains that, in the earliest Buddhist texts (which he identifies as the first four ''[[Sutta Pitaka|nikāyas]]''), those seeking [[Nirvana|the extinction of suffering]] (''nibbana'') pursued the [[Noble Eightfold Path|noble eightfold path]].  As time went on, a [[backstory]] was provided for the [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|multi-life]] development of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]; as a result, the ten perfections were identified as part of the path for the [[bodhisattva]] (Pāli: ''bodhisatta'').  Over subsequent centuries, the ''pāramīs'' were seen as being significant for aspirants to both Buddhahood and [[Arhat|arahantship]].  Thus, Bodhi (2005) summarizes:
:It should be noted that in established Theravāda tradition the pāramīs are not regarded as a discipline peculiar to candidates for Buddhahood alone but as practices which must be fulfilled by all aspirants to enlightenment and deliverance, whether as [[Buddhahood|Buddhas]], [[paccekabuddha]]s, or [[sravaka|disciples]]. What distinguishes the supreme bodhisattva from aspirants in the other two vehicles is the degree to which the pāramīs must be cultivated and the length of time they must be pursued. But the qualities themselves are universal requisites for deliverance, which all must fulfill to at least a minimal degree to merit the fruits of the liberating path.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/wheel409.html Bodhi (2005).]  (Converted the document's original use of the [[Velthuis]] convention to [[Pali#Alphabet with diacritics|Pāli]] diacritics.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mahāyāna Buddhism ==

In [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] Buddhism, the [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñapāramitā sūtras]], the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' and a large number of other texts list the six perfections:

# ''[[Dāna]] pāramitā'': generosity, giving of oneself (in Chinese, Korean, and Japanese, 布施波羅蜜; in Tibetan, སྦྱིན་པ ''sbyin-pa'')
# ''[[Śīla]] pāramitā'' : virtue, morality, discipline, proper conduct (持戒波羅蜜; ཚུལ་ཁྲིམས ''tshul-khrims'')
# ''[[Kshanti|{{IAST|Kṣānti}}]] pāramitā'' : patience, tolerance, forbearance, acceptance, endurance (忍辱波羅蜜; བཟོད་པ ''bzod-pa'')
# ''[[Vīrya]] pāramitā'' : energy, diligence, vigor, effort (精進波羅蜜; བརྩོན་འགྲུས ''brtson-’grus'')
# ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|Dhyāna]] pāramitā'' : one-pointed concentration, contemplation (禪定波羅蜜, བསམ་གཏན ''bsam-gtan'')
# ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajñā]] pāramitā'' : wisdom, insight (般若波羅蜜; ཤེས་རབ ''shes-rab'')

Note that this list is also mentioned by the Theravāda commentator [[Dhammapala]], who says it is equivalent to the above list of ten.&lt;ref&gt;The passage is translated in Bodhi (1978), p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Ten Stages Sutra]]'', four more pāramitās are listed:

:7. ''[[upaya|Upāya]] pāramitā'': skillful means (方便波羅蜜）
:8. ''[[Bodhisattva vow|Praṇidhāna]] pāramitā'': vow, resolution, aspiration, determination (願波羅蜜）
:9. ''[[Five Strengths|Bala]] pāramitā'': spiritual power (力波羅蜜）
:10. ''[[Jnana|Jñāna]] pāramitā'': knowledge (智波羅蜜）

== Tibetan Buddhism ==
According to the perspective of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] practitioners have the choice of two practice paths: the path of perfection (Sanskrit: ''pāramitāyāna'') or the path of [[tantra]] (Sanskrit: ''tantrayāna''), which is the [[Vajrayana|Vajrayāna]].

[[Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche]] renders "pāramitā" into English as "transcendent action" and then frames and qualifies it:
{{quote|When we say that ''paramita'' means "transcendent action," we mean it in the sense that actions or attitude are performed in a non-egocentric manner.  "Transcendental" does not refer to some external reality, but rather to the way in which we conduct our lives and perceive the world – either in an egocentric or a non-egocentric way.  The six ''paramitas'' are concerned with the effort to step out of the egocentric mentality.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald A. (ed.) (2004).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3066">In [[calculus]], 
the '''racetrack principle''' describes the movement and growth of two functions in terms of their [[derivative]]s.

This principle is derived from the fact that if a horse named Frank Fleetfeet always runs faster than a horse named Greg Gooseleg, then if Frank and Greg start a race from the same place and the same time, then Frank will win.  More briefly, the horse that starts fast and stays fast wins.

In symbols: 
:if &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&gt;g'(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;f(0)=g(0)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x)&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. 
or, substituting ≥ for &gt; produces the theorem
:if &lt;math&gt;f'(x) \ge g'(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;f(0)=g(0)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x) \ge g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. 
which can be proved in a similar way

==Proof==
This principle can be proven by considering the function h(x) = f(x) - g(x). If we were to take the derivative we would notice that for x&gt;0

:&lt;math&gt; h'= f'-g'&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

Also notice that h(0) = 0. Combining these observations, we can use the [[mean value theorem]] on the interval [0, x] and get

:&lt;math&gt; h'(x_0)= \frac{h(x)-h(0)}{x-0}= \frac{f(x)-g(x)}{x}&gt;0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since x &gt; 0 for the mean value theorem to work then we may conclude that f(x) - g(x) &gt; 0. This implies f(x) &gt; g(x).

==Generalizations==

The statement of the racetrack principle can slightly generalized as follows; 
:if &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&gt;g'(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;f(a)=g(a)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x)&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

as above, substituting ≥ for &gt; produces the theorem 
:if &lt;math&gt;f'(x) \ge g'(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and if &lt;math&gt;f(a)=g(a)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f(x) \ge g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

===Proof===
This generalization can be proved from the racetrack principle as follows:

Consider functions &lt;math&gt;f_2(x)=f(x-a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_2(x)=g(x-a)&lt;/math&gt;.
Given that &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&gt;g'(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(a)=g(a)&lt;/math&gt;,

&lt;math&gt;f_2'(x)&gt;g_2'(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f_2(0)=g_2(0)&lt;/math&gt;, which by the proof of the racetrack principle above means &lt;math&gt;f_2(x)&gt;g_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; so &lt;math&gt;f(x)&gt;g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;.

==Application==
The racetrack principle can be used to prove a [[lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] necessary to show that the [[exponential function]] grows faster than any power function. The lemma required is that
:&lt;math&gt; e^{x}&gt;x &lt;/math&gt;
for all real x. This is obvious for x&lt;0 but the racetrack principle is required for x&gt;0. To see how it is used we consider the functions
:&lt;math&gt; f(x)=e^{x}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; g(x)=x+1.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that f(0) = g(0) and that
:&lt;math&gt; e^{x}&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
because the exponential function is always increasing ([[monotonic]]) so &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&gt;g'(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus by the racetrack principle f(x)&gt;g(x). Thus,
:&lt;math&gt; e^{x}&gt;x+1&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;
for all x&gt;0.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7298">In mathematics, a '''relative scalar''' (of weight&amp;nbsp;''w'') is a scalar-valued function whose transform under a coordinate transform,

\bar{x}^j = \bar{x}^j(x^i)
&lt;/math&gt;

Relative scalars are an important special case of the more general concept of a [[relative tensor]].

==Ordinary scalar==
An '''ordinary scalar''' or '''absolute scalar'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Veblen |first=Oswald |authorlink=Oswald Veblen |title=Invariants of Quadratic Differential Forms |url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/knowledge/isbn/item1156775/?site_locale=en_US |accessdate=3 October 2012 |year=2004 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-60484-2 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the &lt;math&gt;w=0&lt;/math&gt; case.

If &lt;math&gt;x^i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}^j&lt;/math&gt; refer to the same point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; on the manifold, then we desire &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(\bar{x}^j) = f(x^i)&lt;/math&gt;. This equation can be interpreted two ways when &lt;math&gt;\bar{x}^j&lt;/math&gt; are viewed as the "new coordinates" and &lt;math&gt;x^i&lt;/math&gt; are viewed as the "original coordinates". The first is as &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(\bar{x}^j) = f(x^i(\bar{x}^j))&lt;/math&gt;, which "converts the function to the new coordinates". The second is as &lt;math&gt;f(x^i)=\bar{f}(\bar{x}^j(x^i))&lt;/math&gt;, which "converts back to the original coordinates. Of course, "new" or "original" is a relative concept.

There are many physical quantities that are represented by ordinary scalars, such as temperature and pressure.

===Weight 0 example===
Suppose the temperature in a room is given in terms of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z)= 2 x + y + 5&lt;/math&gt; in Cartesian coordinates &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; and the function in cylindrical coordinates &lt;math&gt;(r,t,h)&lt;/math&gt; is desired. The two coordinate systems are related by the following sets of equations:
:&lt;math&gt; r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; t = \arctan(y/x) \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; h = z \, &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt; x = r \cos(t) \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = r \sin(t) \, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; z = h. \, &lt;/math&gt;

Using &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(\bar{x}^j) = f(x^i(\bar{x}^j))&lt;/math&gt; allows one to derive &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(r,t,h)= 2 r \cos(t)+ r \sin(t) + 5&lt;/math&gt; as the transformed function.

Consider the point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; whose Cartesian coordinates are &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)=(2,3,4)&lt;/math&gt; and whose corresponding value in the cylindrical system is &lt;math&gt;(r,t,h)=(\sqrt{13},\arctan{(3/2)},4)&lt;/math&gt;. A quick calculation shows that &lt;math&gt;f(2,3,4)=12&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(\sqrt{13},\arctan{(3/2)},4)=12&lt;/math&gt; also. This equality would have held for any chosen point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; is the "temperature function in the Cartesian coordinate system" and &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(r,t,h)&lt;/math&gt; is the "temperature function in the cylindrical coordinate system".

One way to view these functions is as representations of the "parent" function that takes a point of the manifold as an argument and gives the temperature.

The problem could have been reversed. One could have been given &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; and wished to have derived the Cartesian temperature function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;. This just flips the notion of "new" vs the "original" coordinate system.

Suppose that one wishes to ''integrate'' these functions over "the room", which will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;. (Yes, integrating temperature is strange but that's partly what's to be shown.) Suppose the region &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is given in cylindrical coordinates as &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;[0,2]&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;[0,\pi/2]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;[0,2]&lt;/math&gt; (that is, the "room" is a quarter slice of a cylinder of radius and height 2).
The integral of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; over the region &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^2 \! \int_{0}^\sqrt{2^2-x^2} \! \int_0^2 \! f(x,y,z) \, dz \, dy \, dx = 16 + 10 \pi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=int_0^2+int_0^%28sqrt%282^2-x^2%29%29+int_0^2+%282+x+%2B+y+%2B+5%29+dz+dy+dx]&lt;/ref&gt;
The value of the integral of &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; over the same region is
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^2 \! \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \! \int_0^2 \! \bar{f}(r,t,h) \, dh \, dt \, dr = 12 + 10 \pi&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=int_0^2+int_0^%28pi%2F2%29+int_0^2+%282+r+cos%28t%29+%2B+r+cos%28t%29+%2B+5%29+dh+dt+dr]&lt;/ref&gt;
They are not equal. The integral of temperature is not independent of the coordinate
system used. It is non-physical in that sense, hence "strange". Note that if the integral of &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; included a factor of the Jacobian (which is just &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;),
we get
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^2 \! \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \! \int_0^2 \! \bar{f}(r,t,h) r \, dh \, dt \, dr = 16 + 10 \pi&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=int_0^2+int_0^%28pi%2F2%29+int_0^2+%282+r+cos%28t%29+%2B+r+cos%28t%29+%2B+5%29+r^2+dh+dt+dr]&lt;/ref&gt;
which ''is'' equal to the original integral but it is not however the integral of ''temperature'' because
temperature is a relative scalar of weight 0, not a relative scalar of weight 1.

===Weight 1 example===
If we had said &lt;math&gt;f(x,y,z)= 2 x + y + 5&lt;/math&gt; was representing mass density, however, then its transformed value
should include the Jacobian factor that takes into account the geometric distortion of the coordinate
system. The transformed function is now &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(r,t,h)= (2 r \cos(t)+ r \sin(t) + 5) r&lt;/math&gt;. This time
&lt;math&gt;f(2,3,4)=12&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}(\sqrt{13},\arctan{(3/2)},4)=12\sqrt{29}&lt;/math&gt;. As before
is integral (the total mass) in Cartesian coordinates is
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^2 \! \int_{0}^\sqrt{2^2-x^2} \! \int_0^2 \! f(x,y,z) \, dz \, dy \, dx = 16 + 10 \pi&lt;/math&gt;.
The value of the integral of &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; over the same region is
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^2 \! \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \! \int_0^2 \! \bar{f}(r,t,h) \, dh \, dt \, dr = 16 + 10 \pi&lt;/math&gt;.
They are equal. The integral of mass ''density'' gives total mass which is a coordinate-independent concept.
Note that if the integral of &lt;math&gt;\bar{f}&lt;/math&gt; also included a factor of the Jacobian like before, we get
:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^2 \! \int_{0}^{\pi/2} \! \int_0^2 \! \bar{f}(r,t,h) r \, dh \, dt \, dr = 24 + 40 \pi /3&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=int_0^2+int_0^%28pi%2F2%29+int_0^2+%282+r+cos%28t%29+%2B+r+cos%28t%29+%2B+5%29+r^2+dh+dt+dr]&lt;/ref&gt;
which is not equal to the previous case.

==Other cases==
Weights other than 0 and 1 do not arise as often. It can be shown the determinant of a type (0,2) tensor is a relative scalar of weight 2.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9872">'''Religious stratification'''  is the division of a society into hierarchical layers on the basis of [[religious belief]]s, affiliation, or [[faith]] practices.  

According to [[Kingsley Davis]] and [[Wilbert E. Moore]], "[t]he reason why religion is necessary is apparently to be found in the fact that human society achieves its unity primarily through the possession by its members of certain ultimate values and ends in common".&lt;ref&gt;*Davis, Kingsley and Wilbert E Moore, 1945.  "Some Principles of Stratification," ''American Sociological Review 10''(April): 242-49.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Davis and Moore contend that it is "the role of religious belief and ritual to supply and reinforce this appearance of reality" that these "certain ultimate values" have. This is one possible explanation for why [[religion]] is one of the underlying factors which links various forms of [[Social inequality|inequality]] into a chain of [[Social stratification|stratification]].

==Critical overview==
Broadly defined, [[social stratification]] is constituted by the division of a society into hierarchical layers of wealth, power, and prestige. These layers, or strata, have been related to a variety of social categories, such as:

*[[Race (classification of humans)|Race]]
*[[Social class|Class]]
*[[Gender]]
*[[Ethnicity]]
*[[Religion]]

[[Sociologist]]s have paid attention to stratification based on race, class, gender, and ethnicity.  Religion is closely tied to ethnic affiliation. Research suggests that religious stratification deserves more attention than it usually gets. It is a common development in religiously diverse societies. Once it becomes embedded in societies' laws, customs, and ideologies, it tends to persist. It also has societal consequences. Thus, it is important in its own right, but also in relation to other forms of stratification.

==In the United States==

Sociologists James D. Davidson and Ralph E. Pyle (2011) argue that religious stratification emerged during America's colonial period, as a result of religious [[ethnocentrism]], religious competition, and unequal resources. They show that Anglicans, Congregationalists, and Presbyterians were over-represented among the economic, political, and educational elites. Other Protestant groups, Catholics, Jews, and people with no religious preference ranked much lower in status. 

The ranking of religious groups has changed in some ways over the course of U.S. history (Davidson and Pyle 2011, Pyle 1996). Most notably, Jews have risen into the upper stratum, while Catholics have climbed into the upper-middle stratum. However, religious stratification persists. For example, Anglicans (now Episcopalians), Congregationalists (now United Church of Christ), and Presbyterians remain in the upper stratum, and other Protestants groups such as Baptists (who ranked low in the colonial period) still have not experienced much upward mobility. 

These developments are linked to inter-religious power struggles related to membership size, organizational capacity, and resources. The struggles affect societal laws, ideologies, and customs. In the colonial period, religious stratification was justified by law: Congregationalists were the "established" church in New England colonies; Anglicans were the "established" church in southern colonies. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First]] and [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth]] Amendments, along with other civil rights laws, have knocked the legal foundation out from under religious stratification. The pro-Protestant ideology that emerged in the colonial period has been tempered somewhat by [[multiculturalism]], but it remains an integral part of American culture. Religious groups that have adapted most to this ideology have experienced more mobility than other groups. Colonial elites also have developed a number of customs, such as church-sponsored preparatory schools, private colleges, universities, and [[legacy preferences|legacy admission]]s that have perpetuated their prominence (Coe and Davidson 2011). Another custom has been the tendency to appoint other religious elites to political office (Davidson, Kraus, and Morrissey 2005). Jews and Catholics have developed customs of their own, such as parochial schools and business ownership, that have contributed to improvements in their social status.

Contrary to Davis and Moore's argument that stratification is functional for society, Davidson and Pyle (2011) argue that religious stratification destabilizes society. It produces social problems, like religious hate crimes, that would not otherwise exist.

==Stratification as the result of the social implications of religion==

According to Evelyn L. Lehrer religion has a significant impact on marital stability, the choice of marital partner, fertility, women's work at home and in the labor market, education, wages and wealth, and the timing of entry into first union and the choice of whether to cohabit.&lt;ref&gt;Evelyn L. Lehrer ''Religion as a Determinant of Economic and Demographic Behavior''&lt;/ref&gt;  In her research there are many instances in which stratification is the byproduct of religious faith practices.  Stratification based on religion is evident specifically in the realm of economics.
  
One case in point is the presence of women in the work force. Lehrer explains "The Mormon and conservative Protestant faiths make a sharp distinction between male and female social and economic roles, encouraging the traditional division of labor within the household when young children are present" (713).  Depending on the socioeconomic class of the family, the expectation of the woman to adhere to these traditional social roles could be a factor by which the economic advancement of the family is limited. 
 
Cited within Lehrer's book are studies which examine levels of education, wages, and wealth among different religious faiths.  Lehrer writes in her book, "A conservative Protestant upbringing may be associated with an authoritarian approach to knowledge and a rejection of critical inquiry and unconventional modes of thinking, implying lower levels of certain types of home investments in child quality" (716).  This was derived from the work of Sherkat and Darnell published in 1999.  Also based on the work of Sherkat and Darnell published in 1997, is Lehrer's assertion that conservative Protestant parents "often discourage their children from taking college preparatory courses, out of a concern that such courses may be harmful to them" (716).  Lehrer, as a result, contends that children raised by conservative Protestant parents "often acquire less human capital in their formative years and may thus be less able to benefit from college" (716).   So, as the topic is quite well developed, educational inequality is well researched and there is much evidence concerning the impact that an individual's level of education can have in terms of the hierarchy of stratification.  It seems however that there can be seen another factor which should be allowed for in terms of determining the lines of stratification.  Perhaps the significant impact that education plays in inequality can be even better understood when religion is controlled for.  

Other works which have investigated religious stratification include that of Gaetano Mosca whose research was published in his The Ruling Class.  Although this work was published in the late 1930s the concept that is brought forth is interesting to note and is perhaps still quite relevant in contemporary times.  Mosca states that "In societies in which religious beliefs are strong and ministers of the faith form a special class a priestly aristocracy almost always arises and gains possession of a more or less important share of the wealth and the political power."

'''Styrobot''' is the name applied to a number of site-specific sculptural assemblages created by the artist [[Michael Salter]]. Robotic figures puzzled together from discarded [[polystyrene]] packing forms, Styrobots have risen ceiling-high to dominate their space.

The six-foot tall figure led to a solo show at the [[Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], where, in a 30-foot high available space, former curator David J. Brown suggested: "Why don't you make a really big one?" With that, Salter says, "I went to town."&lt;ref name=RegisterGuard/&gt; His giant Styrobots have since appeared in shows in [[New York City]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Houston]], [[Miami]], and [[City of Brussels|Brussels, Belgium]].&lt;ref name="JeffBailey" /&gt;&lt;ref name=RegisterGuard/&gt;&lt;ref name= think.21/&gt;

In his review of Salter's 2008 show at the Jeff Bailey Gallery in New York, critic [[Edward Leffingwell]] characterized the massive ''Styrobot'' as demonstrating the notion that the artist "seems to toy with the replicable quality of a culture represented by freshly designed or appropriated images."&lt;ref name="JeffBailey"/&gt; "It more or less dominated the space," Bailey said.&lt;ref name=RegisterGuard/&gt; Curator David Brown has written that "the Styrobots are dazzling in their splendor, ambitious in their realization, and serve evidence to the artist's expansive interest in the bombardment of images that we suffer."&lt;ref name=RegisterGuard/&gt; For Salter's 2009 installation ''If You Don't Buy It From Us, It's Not Our Problem'', think.21 Gallery in Brussels proposed the figure of the Styrobot as:
:''"commenting on waste, the re-use of discarded material, and our uneasy relationship technology. The object itself can appear intriguing and beautiful. At first it appears to be a friendly machine, yet after close inspection it nevertheless reveals a much alarming reality. The polystyrene robot becomes a fearsome symbol of human consuming folly that is set to destroy mankind."''&lt;ref name=think.21/&gt;

The word "Styrobot" is a [[portmanteau]] of the words "[[styrofoam]]" and "[[robot]]".

[[File:Sonnensensor.jpg|thumbnail|right|Non-linear sun sensor used by the [[TET-1]] German [[Miniaturized satellite|microsatellite]].]]
A '''sun sensor''' is a [[navigational instrument]] used by [[spacecraft]] to detect the position of the [[sun]].&lt;ref name="airbus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt; Sun sensors are used for [[attitude control]], [[solar array]] pointing, [[gyroscope|gyro]] updating, and [[safe mode (spacecraft)|fail-safe]] recovery.&lt;ref name="adcole_DSS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adcole_HA"/&gt;

In addition to spacecraft, sun sensors find use in ground-based [[weather station]]s and sun-tracking systems, and aerial vehicles including [[Balloon (aeronautics)|balloon]]s and [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]]s.&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt;

==Mechanism==
There are various types of sun sensors, which differ in their technology and performance characteristics. Sun presence sensors provide a [[binary number|binary]] output, indicating when the sun is within the sensor's [[field of view]]. [[Analog electronics|Analog]] and [[digital electronics|digital]] sun sensors, in contrast, indicate the angle of the sun by continuous and [[discrete signal]] outputs, respectively.&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt;

In typical sun sensors, a thin slit at the top of a rectangular chamber allows a line of light to fall on an array of [[photodetector]] cells at the bottom of the chamber. A voltage is induced in these cells, which is registered electronically. By orienting two sensors perpendicular to each other, the direction of the sun can be fully determined.&lt;ref name="azo"/&gt;

Often, multiple sensors will share processing electronics.&lt;ref name="adcole_DSS"/&gt;

==Criteria==
There are a number of design and performance criteria which dictate the selection of a sun sensor model:
*[[Field of view]]
*[[Angular resolution]]
*[[Accuracy and precision|Accuracy]] and [[Stochastic drift|stability]]
*[[Mass]] and [[volume]]
*Input voltage and power
*Output characteristics (including electrical characteristics, update frequency, [[nonlinearity]], and encoding)
*Durability (including [[radiation hardening]] and tolerance to [[vibration]] and [[residual stress|thermal cycling]])

A '''supertaster''' is a person who experiences the sense of [[taste]] with far greater intensity than average, with some studies showing an increased sensitivity to bitter tastes.  It may be a cause of [[Selective eating disorder|selective eating]], but selective eaters are not necessarily supertasters, and vice versa.

==History==

The term originates with experimental psychologist [[Linda Bartoshuk]] who has spent much of her career studying genetic variation in taste perception. In the early 1980s, Bartoshuk and her colleagues noticed some individuals tested in the laboratory seemed to have an elevated taste response and took to calling them supertasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |id={{INIST|5536670}} |last1=Bartoshuk |first1=L. M. |year=1991 |title=Sweetness: history, preference, and genetic variability |journal=Food technology |issn=0015-6639 |volume=45 |issue=11 |pages=108–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious |Origin of term 'Supertaster' |reason=Earlier references available. Editor referencing Bartoshuk seems biased for Bartoshuk. |date=August 2013}} This increased taste response is not the result of [[response bias]] or a scaling artifact, but appears to have an anatomical/biological basis.

===Phenylthiocarbamide===

In 1931, Arthur L. Fox, a [[DuPont]] chemist, discovered that some persons found [[phenylthiocarbamide]] (PTC) to be bitter while others found it tasteless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fox |first1=AF |title=Six in ten 'tasteblind' to bitter chemical |journal=Sci News Lett |year=1931 |volume=9 |pages=249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartoshuk 2000"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/appe.1999.0287 |title=Psychophysical advances aid the study of genetic variation in taste |year=2000 |last1=Bartoshuk |first1=LM |journal=Appetite |volume=34 |pages=105 |pmid=10744897 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1931 meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]], Fox collaborated with Albert F. Blakeslee, a geneticist, to have attendees taste PTC: 65% found it bitter, 28% found it tasteless, and 6% described other taste qualities. Subsequent work revealed that the ability to taste PTC was genetic.

===Propylthiouracil===

In the 1960s, [[Roland L. Fischer|Roland Fischer]] was the first to link the ability to taste PTC, and the related{{clarify|date=October 2016}} compound [[propylthiouracil]] (PROP), to food preference and body type{{which|date=October 2016}}. Today, PROP has replaced PTC in taste research because{{clarify|date=October 2016}} of a faint sulfurous odor and safety concerns with PTC.&lt;ref name="TexleyKwan2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Juliana Texley|author2=Terry Kwan|author3=John Summers|title=Investigating Safely: A Guide for High School Teachers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SJYGmkmnPT8C&amp;pg=PT90|date=1 January 2004|publisher=NSTA Press|isbn=978-0-87355-202-8|pages=90–}}&lt;/ref&gt; As described above, Bartoshuk and colleagues discovered that the taster group could be further divided into medium tasters and supertasters. Most estimates suggest 25% of the population are nontasters{{clarify|date=October 2016}}, 50% are medium tasters, and 25% are supertasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roxby|first=Philippa|title=Why taste is all in the senses|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-20640337|newspaper=BBC News Health|date=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==

The cause of this heightened response is unknown, although it is thought to be related to the presence of the TAS2R38 gene, the ability to taste PROP and PTC, and, at least in part, due to an increased number of [[fungiform papillae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0031-9384(94)90361-1 |title=PTC/PROP tasting: Anatomy, psychophysics, and sex effects |year=1994 |last1=Bartoshuk |first1=Linda M. |last2=Duffy |first2=Valerie B. |last3=Miller |first3=Inglis J. |journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior |volume=56 |issue=6 |pages=1165–71 |pmid=7878086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any evolutionary advantage to supertasting is unclear. In some environments, heightened taste response, particularly to bitterness, would represent an important advantage in avoiding potentially toxic plant alkaloids. In other environments, increased response to bitterness may have limited the range of palatable foods.

===TAS2R38===

The bitter-taste-receptor gene [[TAS2R38]] has been associated with the ability to taste PROP&lt;ref name="Duffy 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/01.ALC.0000145789.55183.D4 |title=Bitter Receptor Gene (TAS2R38), 6-n-Propylthiouracil (PROP) Bitterness and Alcohol Intake |year=2004 |last1=Duffy |first1=Valerie B. |last2=Davidson |first2=Andrew C. |last3=Kidd |first3=Judith R. |last4=Kidd |first4=Kenneth K. |last5=Speed |first5=William C. |last6=Pakstis |first6=Andrew J. |last7=Reed |first7=Danielle R. |last8=Snyder |first8=Derek J. |last9=Bartoshuk |first9=Linda M. |journal=Alcoholism: Clinical &amp; Experimental Research |volume=28 |issue=11 |pages=1629–37 |pmid=15547448 |pmc=1397913 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and PTC;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.01.047 |title=The Molecular Basis of Individual Differences in Phenylthiocarbamide and Propylthiouracil Bitterness Perception |year=2005 |last1=Bufe |first1=Bernd |last2=Breslin |first2=Paul A.S. |last3=Kuhn |first3=Christina |last4=Reed |first4=Danielle R. |last5=Tharp |first5=Christopher D. |last6=Slack |first6=Jay P. |last7=Kim |first7=Un-Kyung |last8=Drayna |first8=Dennis |last9=Meyerhof |first9=Wolfgang |journal=Current Biology |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=322–7 |pmid=15723792 |pmc=1400547 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it cannot completely explain supertasting.&lt;ref name="pmid18209019"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/chemse/bjm084 |title=Supertasting and PROP Bitterness Depends on More Than the TAS2R38 Gene |year=2008 |last1=Hayes |first1=J.

Women are more likely to be supertasters, as are those from Asia, South America, and Africa.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/body/articles/senses/supertaster.shtml Science of supertasters] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

===Identification===
[[File:Blue tongue.jpg|thumb|150px|Tongue's fungiform papillae revealed with blue food dye.]]
Supertasters were initially identified on the basis of the perceived intensity of [[propylthiouracil]] (PROP) compared to a reference salt solution. However, because supertasters have a larger sense of taste than medium or nontasters, this can cause [[Image scaling|scaling artifacts]].&lt;ref name="Bartoshuk 2000"/&gt; Subsequently, salt has been replaced with a non-oral auditory standard. That is, if two individuals rate the same physical stimulus at a comparable perceptual intensity, but one gives a rating twice as large for the bitterness of a PROP solution, the experimenter can be confident the difference is real and not merely the result of how the person is using the scale.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Today, there is a phenylalanine test strip. The general population tastes this as bitter about 5% of the time.

Many studies do not include a cross-modal reference and simply categorize individuals on the basis of the bitterness of a concentrated PROP solution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/chemse/26.8.993 |title=Binary Taste Mixture Interactions in PROP Non-tasters, Medium-tasters and Super-tasters |year=2001 |last1=Prescott |first1=J. |last2=Ripandelli |first2=N. |last3=Wakeling |first3=I. |journal=Chemical Senses |volume=26 |issue=8 |pages=993–1003 |pmid=11595676}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lanier 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2004.10.004 |title=Sweet and bitter tastes of alcoholic beverages mediate alcohol intake in of-age undergraduates |year=2005 |last1=Lanier |first1=S |last2=Hayes |first2=J |last3=Duffy |first3=V |journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior |volume=83 |issue=5 |pages=821}}&lt;/ref&gt; or PROP impregnated paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0031-9384(00)00223-7 |title=Bitter taste perception and severe vomiting in pregnancy |year=2000 |last1=Sipiora |first1=M.L |last2=Murtaugh |first2=M.A |last3=Gregoire |first3=M.B |last4=Duffy |first4=V.B |journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior |volume=69 |issue=3 |pages=259–67 |pmid=10869591}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to make a reasonably accurate [[self-diagnosis]] at home by careful examination of the tongue and looking for the number of [[fungiform papillae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Super-Tasting Science: Find Out If You're a "Supertaster"!|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/super-tasting-science-find-out-if-youre-a-supertaster/|accessdate=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue food dye can make this easier.  Being a supertaster or nontaster is part of normal variation in the human population, as are eye color and hair color, so no treatment is needed.

In [[mathematics]], '''tensor calculus''' or '''tensor analysis''' is an extension of [[vector calculus]] to [[tensor field]]s ([[tensor]]s that may vary over a [[manifold]], e.g. in [[spacetime]]).

Developed by [[Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro]] and his student [[Tullio Levi-Civita]], it was used by [[Albert Einstein]] to develop his [[theory of general relativity]]. Contrasted with the infinitesimal calculus, tensor calculus allows presentation of physics equations in a [[Manifest covariance|form that is independent]] of the [[coordinate chart|choice of coordinates]] on the manifold.

Tensor calculus has many real-life applications in [[physics]] and [[engineering]], including [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[continuum mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]] (see [[mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field]]), [[general relativity]] (see [[mathematics of general relativity]]),[[quantum field theory]].

==Plot==
Elisa Esposito ([[Sally Hawkins]]) who was found abandoned as a child by the side of a river with wounds on her neck, is [[Muteness|mute]] and communicates through [[Sign language|sign language]]. She lives alone in an apartment above a cinema and works as a cleaner at a secret government laboratory in Baltimore, Maryland, at the height of the [[Cold War]]. Her only friends are her [[Closeted|closeted]] next-door neighbor Giles ([[Richard Jenkins]]) a middle-aged struggling advertising illustrator and Zelda ([[Octavia Spencer]]) a co-worker who serves as her interpreter.

The facility receives a mysterious creature captured from the [[Amazon River]] by Colonel Richard Strickland ([[Michael Shannon]]) who is in charge of the project to study it. Believing it is just a wild beast, Strickland treats it brutally, repeatedly shocking it with his electric [[Cattle prod|cattle prod]]. Curious about the creature, Elisa discovers it is a male humanoid amphibian ([[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]]). She begins visiting him in secret and the two form a close bond as she teaches him sign language.

Seeking to exploit the Amphibian Man for an American advantage in the [[Space Race|space race]], General Frank Hoyt ([[Nick Searcy]]) is eventually persuaded by Strickland to [[Vivisection|vivisect]] it. One scientist, Robert Hoffstetler ([[Michael Stuhlbarg]]) - who is really a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy named Dimitri Mosenkov - pleads unsuccessfully to keep the Amphibian Man alive for further study and, at the same time, is ordered by his Soviet handlers to [[Euthanasia|euthanize]] the creature. When Elisa overhears the American plans for the Amphibian Man, she persuades Giles to help her free him. Hoffstetler stumbles upon Elisa's plot in progress and chooses to help her. Though initially reluctant, Zelda also becomes involved in the successful escape.

Elisa keeps the Amphibian Man in her bathtub. She plans to release him into a nearby canal when it rains to give access to the ocean in several days' time. Strickland interrogates Elisa and Zelda, among others, but learns nothing. Back at the apartment, Giles discovers the Amphibian Man devouring one of his cats. Startled, the Amphibian Man slashes Giles's arm and rushes out of the apartment. He gets as far as the cinema downstairs, luckily empty of patrons, before Elisa finds him and returns him to her apartment. He touches Giles on his balding head and his wounded arm, and the next morning Giles discovers his hair has begun growing back and the wounds on his arm have healed. After initially walking away, Elisa has sex with the Amphibian Man in her shower. For a later encounter, she fills the bathroom completely with water, which eventually begins to cause water to drip into the theater below. The upset theater owner alerts Giles, who then enters the apartment and opens the bathroom door, interrupting the tryst.

Hoyt unexpectedly arrives and asks for the status of the case. When Strickland questions how much experimentation is enough, he is told he has 36 hours to recover the Amphibian Man or his career and life will be over. Meanwhile, Hoffstetler is told he will be [[Extraction (military)|extracted]] in two days. As the planned release date approaches, the Amphibian Man's health starts deteriorating. Hoffstetler goes to meet his handlers with Strickland tailing him. At the rendezvous, Hoffstetler is shot by a handler before Strickland kills him and then continuously tortures Hoffstetler for information (knowing he is a spy by virtue of having heard him speak Russian to his handler) while asking for the name and rank of who has the creature. Before dying, Hoffstetler implicates Elisa and Zelda. Strickland savagely threatens Zelda in her home until her husband Brewster (Martin Roach) reveals that Elisa has the Amphibian Man (having overheard her conversations). After Strickland's departure, Zelda immediately calls Elisa, warning her to get the creature out immediately. An enraged Strickland arrives and searches Elisa's empty apartment until he finds a calendar note revealing where she plans to release the Amphibian Man.

At the canal, Elisa and Giles are bidding farewell to the creature when Strickland arrives, knocks Giles down, and shoots the Amphibian Man and Elisa. The Amphibian Man quickly heals himself and slashes Strickland's throat, killing him. As police arrive on the scene with Zelda, the Amphibian Man takes Elisa and jumps into the canal, where he heals her. When he applies his healing touch to the scars on Elisa's neck, they open to reveal [[Gill|gills]] like his; she jolts back to life, and the two embrace. In a closing [[Voice-over|voice-over]] narration, Giles conveys his belief that Elisa lived "happily ever after in love" with the Amphibian Man.

Del Toro set the film during the 1960s Cold War era to counteract today's heightened tensions, specifying, "if I say once upon a time in 1962, it becomes a fairy tale for troubled times. People can lower their guard a little bit more and listen to the story and listen to the characters and talk about the issues, rather than the circumstances of the issues."&lt;ref name=MNDaily&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Bennett |first=Haley |authorlink=Haley Bennett|title='Review: The Shape of Water' Mermaid film noir sounds like a fishy genre, but director Guillermo del Toro navigates it with skill.|url=http://www.mndaily.com/article/2017/12/a-review-the-shape-of-water|work=[[Minnesota Daily]]|date=December 15, 2017 |access-date=December 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===

A fan of her performances in ''[[Happy-Go-Lucky]]'' and ''[[Fingersmith (TV serial)|Fingersmith]]'', Del Toro wrote the script with [[Sally Hawkins]] in mind for the part and pitched the idea to her while intoxicated at the [[2014 Golden Globes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Lee|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/how-guillermo-del-toro-cast-sally-hawkins-in-shape-of-water.html|title=How Guillermo del Toro Got Drunk at a Golden Globes After-party and Made Sally Hawkins the Star of The Shape of Water|publisher=Vulture|date=November 30, 2017|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710101859/http://www.vulture.com/2017/11/how-guillermo-del-toro-cast-sally-hawkins-in-shape-of-water.html#|archive-date=July 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkins prepared for the role by watching films of silent comedians [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Harold Lloyd]] and was told by Del Toro to watch [[Stan Laurel]] from [[Laurel and Hardy]], whom Del Toro thought was capable of doing a "state of grace without conveying it verbally".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/guillermo-del-toro-the-shape-of-water-fairy-tale-sally-hawkins-richard-jenkins-complete-interview-transcript-news|title=Guillermo del Toro ('The Shape of Water'): 'A fairy tale for troubled times' [Complete Interview Transcript]|last=Beachum|first=Chris|last2=Dixon|first2=Marcus James|date=December 26, 2017|website=GoldDerby|publisher=|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710102211/https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/guillermo-del-toro-the-shape-of-water-fairy-tale-sally-hawkins-richard-jenkins-complete-interview-transcript-news/#|archive-date=July 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of Giles was originally written with [[Ian McKellen]] in mind and Del Toro was inspired to do so by his performance as the real-life closeted gay filmmaker [[James Whale]] who directed ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' and ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'', who found himself unemployable in his later years. When McKellen proved unavailable, Del Toro sent an e-mail to [[Richard Jenkins]], who accepted the part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Patrick|last=Shanley|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/michael-shannon-getting-into-character-shape-of-water|title='Shape of Water' Star Richard Jenkins on Getting Cast Via Email|publisher=Hollywood Reporter|date=February 22, 2018|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180610181536/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/michael-shannon-getting-into-character-shape-of-water#|archive-date=June 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Shannon]] was cast as Richard Strickland, the villain of the film. According to an interview with Vanity Fair, Shannon and Del Toro had early conversations about the notion that Strickland would have been the hero of the film if it had been made in the 1950s, something that fascinated the actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Julie|last=Miller|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/michael-shannon-getting-into-character-shape-of-water|title=For Michael Shannon, the Clothes Made the Man in The Shape of Water|publisher=Vanity Fair|date=December 5, 2017|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180610181536/https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/michael-shannon-getting-into-character-shape-of-water#|archive-date=June 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Octavia Spencer]], who played the role of Elisa's co-worker, friend and interpreter Zelda found it funny that the people Del Toro used to speak for the mute main character were people who represent very disenfranchised groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Chris|last=Beachum|url=https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/octavia-spencer-the-shape-of-water-guillermo-del-toro-sally-hawkins-complete-interview-transcript-video-news/|title=Octavia Spencer ('The Shape of Water'): 'Otherworldly and beautiful' themes are 'very relevant for today' [Complete Interview Transcript]|publisher=GoldDerby|date=December 28, 2017|access-date=July 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710102032/https://www.goldderby.com/article/2017/octavia-spencer-the-shape-of-water-guillermo-del-toro-sally-hawkins-complete-interview-transcript-video-news/#|archive-date=July 10, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visuals===

According to an interview with ''[[The Wrap]]'', Guillermo Del Toro was torn between making the film in color or in black and white, and was at one point leaning toward the latter. [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] offered Del Toro either a $20 million budget to make the film in color or a $17 million budget to shoot it in black and white. "That was honestly a battle I was expecting to lose," Del Toro said to ''The Wrap''. "I was of two minds. On one hand I thought black and white would look luscious, but on the other hand I thought it would look postmodern, like I was being reflective rather than immersed. It's good, because it got me three million more."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Steve |last=Pond |url=https://www.thewrap.com/how-guillermo-del-toro-made-five-movies-in-one-with-the-shape-of-water/ |title='Guillermo del Toro on How 'The Shape of Water' Was Almost Shot in Black and White |publisher=The Wrap |date=January 23, 2018 |access-date=July 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710102012/https://www.thewrap.com/how-guillermo-del-toro-made-five-movies-in-one-with-the-shape-of-water/# |archive-date=July 10, 2018 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Rex Reed]] of the ''[[New York Observer]]'' gave the film 1 out of 4 stars and calling it "a loopy, lunkheaded load of drivel" and, referring to Hawkins's role in ''[[Maudie (film)|Maudie]]'', described people with disabilities as "defective creatures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.com/2017/12/review-sally-hawkins-sinks-in-guillermo-del-toros-the-shape-of-water/|title=One Star: ''The Shape of Water'' Is a Loopy, Lunkheaded Load of Drivel|publisher=[[New York Observer]]|first=Rex|last=Reed|authorlink=Rex Reed|date=December 19, 2017|access-date=January 7, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171220220654/http://observer.com/2017/12/review-sally-hawkins-sinks-in-guillermo-del-toros-the-shape-of-water/#|archive-date=December 20, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reed's review was criticized for referring to Sally Hawkins' mute character as "mentally handicapped" and for erroneously crediting actor [[Benicio del Toro]] as the film's director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/guillermo-del-toro-rex-reed-shape-of-water-review-benicio-1201909629/|title=Rex Reed's Negative 'The Shape of Water' Review Goes Viral After Crediting Benicio del Toro as Director|publisher=[[IndieWire]]|first=Zack|last=Sharf|date=December 20, 2017|access-date=March 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180306023706/https://www.indiewire.com/2017/12/guillermo-del-toro-rex-reed-shape-of-water-review-benicio-1201909629/#|archive-date=March 6, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
{{see also|List of accolades received by The Shape of Water}}
''The Shape of Water'' received 13 nominations at the 90th [[Academy Awards]], the most of any film in the 2018 race. It won in four categories: [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], Best Original Score, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

The film also spawned some debate about whether the fact that it was filmed in Canada, with a predominantly Canadian crew and many Canadian actors in the supporting roles, should have made it eligible to be nominated for the [[Canadian Screen Awards]]. Under [[Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television]] rules, to qualify for CSA nominations under the rules for international coproductions at least 15 per cent of a film's funding must come from a Canadian film studio. Even the film's Canadian co-producer, [[J. Miles Dale]], stated that he supports the rules and does not believe the film should have been eligible.&lt;ref name="toocanadian"&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2018/03/08/are-the-canadian-screen-awards-too-canadian.html "Are the Canadian Screen Awards too Canadian?"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309140451/https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/television/2018/03/08/are-the-canadian-screen-awards-too-canadian.html# |date=March 9, 2018 }}. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', March 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lawsuit alleging plagiarism===
In February 2018, the estate of [[Paul Zindel]] initiated a lawsuit in [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] against director Guillermo del Toro and associate producer Daniel Kraus, alleging that ''The Shape of Water'' "brazenly copies the story, elements, characters, and themes" of Zindel's 1969 work ''[[Let Me Hear You Whisper (play)|Let Me Hear You Whisper]]'', which depicts a cleaning lady bonding with a dolphin and attempting to rescue it from a secret research laboratory's nefarious uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/22/587902480/shape-of-water-creators-sued-over-plagiarism-claims-as-oscars-approach|title='Shape Of Water' Creators Sued Over Plagiarism Claims As Oscars Approach|publisher=|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223144801/https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/22/587902480/shape-of-water-creators-sued-over-plagiarism-claims-as-oscars-approach#|archive-date=February 23, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint spends more than a dozen pages detailing alleged "overwhelming similarities" between the works.&lt;ref&gt;Eliza Berman, [http://time.com/5170613/shape-of-water-plagiarism-controversy/ Everything to Know About the Shape of Water Plagiarism Controversy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305053610/http://time.com/5170613/shape-of-water-plagiarism-controversy/# |date=March 5, 2018 }}, ''Time'' (March 1, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

Del Toro denied the claim of the Zindel estate, saying that "I have never read nor seen the play. I'd never heard of this play before making ''The Shape of Water,'' and none of my collaborators ever mentioned the play." Distributor [[Fox Searchlight]] also denied the claim and said that it would "vigorously defend" itself in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Colin Dwyer|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/22/587902480/shape-of-water-creators-sued-over-plagiarism-claims-as-oscars-approach|title='Shape of Water' Creators Sued Over Plagiarism Claims As Oscars Approach|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=February 23, 2018|access-date=February 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223144801/https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/22/587902480/shape-of-water-creators-sued-over-plagiarism-claims-as-oscars-approach#|archive-date=February 23, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Judge Percy Anderson dismissed the suit and stated that del Toro and Fox Searchlight were entitled to recover their legal costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn C.|title=Judge Dismisses 'Shape Of Water' Lawsuit Waged During Final Oscar Voting Against Guillermo Del Toro's Best Picture Winner|url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/shape-of-water-lawsuit-dismissed-guillermo-del-toro-oscar-best-picture-copyright-1202432680/|publisher=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]|date=July 24, 2018|access-date=July 24, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180724215810/https://deadline.com/2018/07/shape-of-water-lawsuit-dismissed-guillermo-del-toro-oscar-best-picture-copyright-1202432680/#|archive-date=July 24, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shape of Water was also accused by a French director of [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/10/director-oscar-favourite-shape-water-accused-copying-scenes/ copying scenes] from the romantic comedy Amelie and the cult classic Delicatessen&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/02/10/director-oscar-favourite-shape-water-accused-copying-scenes/&lt;/ref&gt;.
Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s black comedy Delicatessen was released in 1991 and quickly became a cult classic, but it was his whimsical take on life and love in the picturesque Paris district of Montmartre, Amelie, that gave him his first global hit.

He claims fellow director Guillermo del Toro was clearly plagiarising one of his scenes in The Shape of Water when he has the characters played by British actor Sally Hawkins and Richard Jenkins perform a two-step dance while sitting on a sofa watching an old Hollywood movie.

There are some very strong similarities in the saturation of the colours, overall art direction and the use of anthropomorphic objects. The music is reminiscent of Yann Tiersen's soundtrack for Amelie.

"When [Guillermo del Toro] steals the scene of the couple sitting on the edge of the bed dancing with their feet, with the musical on telly in the background, it is so cut and pasted from Delicatessen that there’s a moment when I say to myself that he lacks self-respect," said Mr Jeunet.
“It is obvious that he had ‘Delicatessen’ in mind,” he said.

“I’m not going to sue him for plagiarism, that’s not my style. But Guillermo has enough talent not to be doing things like that,” he told Ouest-France newspaper&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ouest-france.fr/culture/la-forme-de-l-eau-jean-pierre-jeunet-accuse-guillermo-del-toro-de-copier-coller-delicatessen-5548366&lt;/ref&gt;.

Mr Jeunet said he emailed the Mexican director to ask him why he was stealing his ideas.
“He replied.. that he did not steal from others, that it was [American director] Terry Gilliam who influenced all of us,” he said

In biology, a '''type''' is a particular [[wiktionary:en:specimen|specimen]] (or in some cases a group of specimens) of an [[organism]] to which the [[scientific name]] of that organism is formally attached. In other words, a type is an example that serves to anchor or centralize the defining features of that particular [[taxon]]. In older usage (pre-1900 in botany), a type was a taxon rather than a specimen.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock/&gt;

A taxon is a scientifically named grouping of organisms with other like organisms, a [[set (mathematics)|set]] that includes some organisms and excludes others, based on a detailed published description (for example a [[species description]]) and on the provision of type material, which is usually available to scientists for examination in a major museum research collection, or similar institution.&lt;ref name=Hitchcock&gt;{{citation |author=Hitchcock, A.S. |year=1921 |title=The Type Concept in Systematic Botany |journal=American Journal of Botany |volume=8 |issue=5 |pages=251–255 |jstor=2434993 |doi=10.2307/2434993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicholson|first1=Dan H.|title=Botanical nomenclature, types, &amp; standard reference works|url=http://botany.si.edu/references/botlinks/dhntyp.htm|publisher=Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, Department of Botany|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type specimen==
According to a precise set of rules laid down in the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN) and the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]] (ICN), the scientific name of every taxon is almost always based on one particular ''specimen'', or in some cases specimens. Types are of great significance to biologists, especially to [[taxonomist]]s. Types are usually physical specimens that are kept in a [[museum]] or [[herbarium]] research collection, but failing that, an image of an individual of that taxon has sometimes been designated as a type.&lt;ref name="MarshallEvenhuis2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Evenhuis|first2=Neal L.|last1=Marshall|first1=Stephen A.|title=New species without dead bodies: a case for photo-based descriptions, illustrated by a striking new species of ''Marleyimyia'' Hesse (Diptera, Bombyliidae) from South Africa |journal=ZooKeys |volume=525 |year=2015 |pages=117–127 |issn=1313-2970 |doi=10.3897/zookeys.525.6143 |pmid=26487819 |pmc=4607853}}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing species and appointing type specimens is part of [[scientific nomenclature]] and [[alpha taxonomy]].

When identifying material, a scientist attempts to apply a taxon name to a specimen or group of specimens based on his or her understanding of the relevant taxa, based on (at least) having read the type description(s), preferably based on an examination of all the type material of all of the relevant taxa. If there is more than one named type that all appear to be the same taxon, then the oldest name takes precedence, and is considered to be the correct name of the material in hand. If on the other hand the taxon appears never to have been named at all, then the scientist or another qualified expert picks a type specimen and publishes a new name and an official description.

This process is crucial to the science of biological [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]]. People's ideas of how living things should be grouped change and shift over time. How do we know that what we call "''[[Canis lupus]]''" is the same thing,  or approximately the same thing, as what they will be calling "''Canis lupus''" in 200 years' time? It is possible to check this because there is a particular wolf specimen preserved in Sweden&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-037-01-0001.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115145/http://www.science.smith.edu/msi/pdf/i0076-3519-037-01-0001.pdf |archive-date=2015-09-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and everyone who uses that name – no matter what else they may mean by it – will include that particular specimen.

Depending on the [[Nomenclature Codes|nomenclature code]] applied to the organism in question, a type can be a specimen, a culture, an [[Biological illustration|illustration]], or (under the bacteriological code) a description. Some codes consider a subordinate taxon to be the type, but under the botanical code the type is always a specimen or illustration.

For example, in the research collection of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London, there is a bird specimen numbered 1886.6.24.20. This is a specimen of a kind of bird commonly known as the [[spotted harrier]], which currently bears the scientific name ''Circus assimilis''. This particular specimen is the [[holotype]] for that species; the name ''Circus assimilis'' refers, by definition, to the species of that particular specimen. That species was named and described by Jardine and Selby in 1828, and the holotype was placed in the museum collection so that other scientists might refer to it as necessary.

Note that at least for type specimens there is no requirement for a "typical" individual to be used. [[Genera]] and [[family (biology)|families]], particularly those established by early taxonomists, tend to be named after species that are more "typical" for them, but here too this is not always the case and due to changes in [[systematics]] ''cannot'' be. Hence, the term [[name-bearing type]] or onomatophore is sometimes used, to denote the fact that biological types do not define "typical" individuals or [[taxa]], but rather fix a scientific name to a specific [[wiktionary:operational taxonomic unit|operational taxonomic unit]]. Type specimens are theoretically even allowed to be aberrant or deformed individuals or color variations, though this is rarely chosen to be the case, as it makes it hard to determine to which population the individual belonged.&lt;ref name="Hitchcock" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=CANBR&gt;{{cite web|title=Plant names – a basic introduction|url=http://www.cpbr.gov.au/chah/avh/help/names/|publisher=Australian National Botanic Gardens, Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research|accessdate=17 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the term ''type'' is somewhat complicated by slightly different uses in [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. In the ''[[PhyloCode]]'', type-based definitions are replaced by [[phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic definitions]].

==Older terminology==
In some older taxonomic works the word "type" has sometimes been used differently. The meaning was similar in the first ''Laws of Botanical Nomenclature'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=de Candolle, A.P.|year=1867|title=Lois de la nomenclature botanique adoptées par le Congrès International de Botanique tenu à Paris en août 1867 suivies d'une deuxième édition de l'introduction historique et du commentaire qui accompagnaient la rédaction préparatoire présentée à la congrès|publisher=J.-B.

&lt;blockquote&gt;{{lang|fr|Ce seul caractère permet de distinguer ce type de toutes les autres espèces de la section. … Après avoir étudié ces diverses formes, j'en arrivai à les considérer comme appartenant à un seul et même type spécifique.}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Translation: This single character permits [one to] distinguish this type from all other species of the section ... After studying the diverse forms, I came to consider them as belonging to the one and the same specific type.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=={{anchor|botany|Botany}}In botany==
In [[botanical nomenclature]], a ''type'' (''typus'', ''nomenclatural type''), "is that element to which the name of a taxon is permanently attached." (article 7.1)&lt;ref name=ICN/&gt; In botany a type is either a specimen or an illustration. A specimen is a real plant (or one or more parts of a plant or a lot of small plants), dead and kept safe, "curated", in a [[herbarium]] (or the equivalent for fungi). Examples of where an illustration may serve as a type include:
* A detailed drawing, painting, etc., depicting the plant, from the early days of plant taxonomy. A dried plant was difficult to transport and hard to keep safe for the future; many specimens from the early days of botany have since been lost or damaged. Highly skilled botanical artists were sometimes employed by a botanist to make a faithful and detailed illustration. Some such illustrations have become the best record and have been chosen to serve as the type of a taxon.
* A detailed picture of something that can be seen only through a [[microscope]]. A tiny "plant" on a [[microscope slide]] makes for a poor type: the microscope slide may be lost or damaged, or it may be very difficult to find the "plant" in question among whatever else is on the microscope slide. An illustration makes for a much more reliable type (Art 37.5 of the ''Vienna Code'', 2006).

Note that a type does not determine the [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the taxon. For example, the common [[dandelion]] is a controversial taxon: some botanists consider it to consist of over a hundred species, and others regard it as a single species. The type of the name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same whether the circumscription of the species includes all those small species (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a "big" species) or whether the circumscription is limited to only one small species among the other hundred (''Taraxacum officinale'' is a "small" species). The name ''Taraxacum officinale'' is the same and the type of the name is the same, but the extent of what the name actually applies to varies greatly. Setting the circumscription of a taxon is done by a taxonomist in a publication.

Miscellaneous notes:
# Only a species or an [[infraspecific taxon]] can have a type of its own. For most new [[taxon|taxa]] (published on or after 1 January 2007, article 37) at these ranks a type should not be an illustration.
# A [[genus]] has the same type as that of one of its [[species]] (article 10).
# A [[Family (biology)|family]] has the same type as that of one of its [[genus|genera]] (article 10).

The ''ICN'' provides a listing of the various kinds of type (article 9),&lt;ref name=ICN&gt;{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012|volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154|title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G.

* holotype
* lectotype
* isotype
* syntype
* paratype
* neotype
* epitype

Note that the word "type" appears in botanical literature as a part of some older terms that have no status under the ''ICN'': for example a clonotype.

==In zoology==
[[File:JamidesEliotiMUpUnAC1.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Lycaenidae|gossamer-winged butterfly]], ''[[Jamides elioti]]'':&lt;br&gt;1) [[Dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] and 2) ventral aspect of holotype,&lt;br&gt;3) dorsal and 4) ventral aspect of paratype]]
In [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|zoological nomenclature]], the type of a species or subspecies is a specimen, or series of specimens.  The type of a genus or subgenus is a species. The type of a suprageneric taxon (e.g., family, etc.) is a genus. Names higher than superfamily rank do not have types. A "name-bearing type" is a specimen or image that "provides the objective standard of reference whereby the application of the name of a nominal taxon can be determined."

===Definitions===
* A type specimen is a vernacular term (not a formally defined term) typically used for an individual or fossil that is any of the various name-bearing types for a [[species]]. For example, the type specimen for the species ''[[Homo neanderthalensis]]'' was the specimen "Neanderthal-1" discovered by [[Johann Karl Fuhlrott]] in 1856 at Feldhofer in the Neander Valley in Germany, consisting of a [[Calvaria (skull)|skullcap]], thigh bones, part of a pelvis, some ribs, and some arm and shoulder bones. There may be more than one type specimen, but there is (at least in modern times) only one holotype.
* A [[type species]] is the [[nominal species]] that is the name-bearing type of a nominal [[genus]] or [[subgenus]].
* A [[type genus]] is the [[nominal genus]] that is the name-bearing type of a nominal family-group taxon.
* The [[type series]] are all those specimens included by the author in a taxon's formal description, unless the author explicitly or implicitly excludes them as part of the series.

===Use of type specimens===
[[File:Mormopterus acetabulosus type illustration.jpg|thumb|Type illustration of ''[[Mormopterus acetabulosus]]'']]
Although in reality biologists may examine many specimens (when available) of a new taxon before writing an official published species description, nonetheless, under the formal rules for naming species (the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature), a single type must be designated, as part of the published description.

A type description must include a diagnosis (typically, a discussion of similarities to and differences from closely related species), and an indication of where the type specimen or specimens are deposited for examination. The geographical location where a type specimen was originally found is known as its '''{{visible anchor|type locality}}'''. In the case of parasites, the term '''{{visible anchor|type host}}''' (or symbiotype) is used to indicate the host organism from which the type specimen was obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.2307/3283335|title=Designation and Curatorial Management of Type Host Specimens (Symbiotypes) for New Parasite Species|jstor=3283335|author1=Frey, Jennifer K. |author2=Yates, Terry L. |author3=Duszynski, Donald W. |author4=Gannon, William L. |author5=Gardner, Scott L. |last-author-amp=yes |journal=The Journal of Parasitology| volume=78|issue=5|year=1992| pages=930–993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zoological collections are maintained by universities and museums. Ensuring that types are kept in good condition and made available for examination by taxonomists are two important functions of such collections. And, while there is only one ''holotype'' designated, there can be other "type" specimens, the following of which are formally defined:

====Holotype====
{{main|Holotype}}
When a single specimen is clearly designated in the original description, this specimen is known as the ''holotype'' of that species. The holotype is typically placed in a major museum, or similar well-known public collection, so that it is freely available for later examination by other biologists.

====Paratype====
{{main|Paratype}}
When the original description designated a holotype, there may still be additional specimens listed in the type series and those are termed paratypes. These are not [[name-bearing type]]s.

====Allotype====
An allotype is a specimen of the opposite sex to the holotype, designated from among paratypes. It was also formerly used for a specimen that shows features not seen in the holotype of a fossil.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth2010"/&gt; The term is not regulated by the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]].

====Neotype====
A neotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen when an original holotype has been lost or destroyed or where the original author never cited a specimen.

====Syntype====
{{Main|Syntype}}
A syntype is any one of two or more specimens that is listed in a species description where no holotype was designated; historically, syntypes were often explicitly designated as such, and under the present ICZN this is a requirement, but modern attempts to publish species description based on syntypes are generally frowned upon by practicing taxonomists, and most are gradually being replaced by lectotypes. Those that still exist are still considered name-bearing types.

====Lectotype====
A lectotype is a specimen later selected to serve as the single type specimen for species originally described from a set of [[syntype]]s.
In zoology, a lectotype is a kind of [[name-bearing type]]. When a species was originally described on the basis of a name-bearing type consisting of multiple specimens, one of those may be designated as the lectotype. Having a single name-bearing type reduces the potential for confusion, especially considering that it is not uncommon for a series of syntypes to contain specimens of more than one species.

A notable example is that [[Carl Linnaeus]] is the lectotype for the species ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stearn, W. T. 1959. "The background of Linnaeus's contributions to the nomenclature and methods of systematic biology", ''Systematic Zoology'' 8 (1): 4-22, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

====Paralectotype====
A paralectotype is any additional specimen from among a set of syntypes, after a lectotype has been designated from among them. These are not name-bearing types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hansen, Hans V. |author2=Seberg, Ole |title=Paralectotype, a new type term in botany |journal=Taxon |year=1984 |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages=707–711 |jstor=1220790 |doi=10.2307/1220790}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hapantotype====
A special case in [[Protistan]]s where the type consists of two or more specimens of "directly related individuals representing distinct stages in the life cycle"; these are collectively treated as a single entity, and lectotypes cannot be designated from among them.

==== '''Iconotype''' ====
An illustration on which a new species or subspecies was based. For instance, the Burmese Python, ''[[Burmese python|Python bivittatus]],'' is one of many species that are based on illustrations by [[Albertus Seba]] (1734).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/62760#/summary|title=Locupletissimi Rerum naturalium Thesauri accurata Descriptio, et Iconibus artificiosissimus Expressio, per universam Physices Historiam.

The Complete Plates in Colour, 1734-1765. 2001.|url=|journal=International Society for the History and Bibliography of Herpetology|volume=3|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ergatotype====
An ergatotype is a specimen selected to represent a worker member in [[hymenopteran]]s which have polymorphic castes.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth2010"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hawksworth |first=D.L. |title=Terms Used in Bionomenclature. The naming of organisms (and plant communities) |date=2010 |publisher=Global Biodiversity Information Facility |location=Copenhagen |isbn=87-92020-09-7 |pages=216 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qky7_6-UcQQC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=ergatotype&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vec4jfleDx&amp;sig=QmCXOeWRVuPYbjtVKFC7OPfaC5g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MtErU7mTL866oQSsn4C4CQ&amp;ved=0CEoQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=ergatotype&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternatives to preserved specimens====
Type illustrations have also been used by zoologists, as in the case of the [[Réunion parakeet]], which is known only from historical illustrations and descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hume|first1=Julian Pender|title=Reappraisal of the parrots (Aves: Psittacidae) from the Mascarene Islands, with comments on their ecology, morphology, and affinities|url=http://julianhume.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Hume-Mascarene-Parrots.pdf|journal=Zootaxa|date=25 June 2007|accessdate=13 January 2011|ISSN=1175-5334|issue=1513|pages=1–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}

Recently, some species have been described where the type specimen was released alive back into the wild, such as the [[Bulo Burti boubou]] (a [[bushshrike]]), described as ''Laniarius liberatus'', in which the species description included DNA sequences from blood and feather samples. Assuming there is no future question as to the status of such a species, the absence of a type specimen does not invalidate the name, but it may be necessary in the future to designate a neotype for such a taxon, should any questions arise. However, in the case of the bushshrike, ornithologists have argued that the specimen was a rare and hitherto unknown [[morph (zoology)|color morph]] of a long-known species, using only the available blood and feather samples. While there is still some debate on the need to deposit actual killed individuals as type specimens, it can be observed that given proper vouchering and storage, tissue samples can be just as valuable should disputes about the validity of a species arise.

====Formalisation of the type system====
The various types listed above are necessary{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} because many species were described one or two centuries ago, when a single type specimen, a holotype, was often not designated. Also, types were not always carefully preserved, and intervening events such as wars and fires have resulted in destruction of original type material. The validity of a species name often rests upon the availability of original type specimens; or, if the type cannot be found, or one has never existed, upon the clarity of the description.

The ICZN has existed only since 1961, when the first edition of the Code was published. The ICZN does not always demand a type specimen for the historical validity of a species, and many "type-less" species do exist. The current edition of the Code, Article 75.3, prohibits the designation of a [[neotype]] unless there is "an exceptional need" for "clarifying the taxonomic status" of a species (Article 75.2).

There are many other permutations and variations on terms using the suffix "-type" (e.g., [[allotype (nomenclature)|allotype]], cotype, [[topotype]], [[generitype]], [[isotype (biology)|isotype]], isoneotype, isolectotype, etc.) but these are not formally regulated by the Code, and a great many are obsolete and/or idiosyncratic. However, some of these categories can potentially apply to genuine type specimens, such as a neotype; e.g., isotypic/topotypic specimens are preferred to other specimens, when they are available at the time a neotype is chosen (because they are from the same time and/or place as the original type).

The term fixation is used by the Code for the declaration of a name-bearing type, whether by original or subsequent designation.

===Type species===
{{Main|Type species}}
[[File:Bufo bufo (Marek Szczepanek).jpg|thumb|The [[common toad]], ''Bufo bufo'' described by [[Linnaeus]], is the type species for the genus ''[[Bufo]]'']]
Each genus must have a designated type species (the term "genotype" was once used for this but has been abandoned because the word has become much better known as the term for [[genotype|a different concept]] in [[genetics]]). The description of a genus is usually based primarily on its type species, modified and expanded by the features of other included species. The generic name is permanently associated with the name-bearing type of its type species.

Ideally, a type species best exemplifies the essential characteristics of the genus to which it belongs, but this is subjective and, ultimately, technically irrelevant, as it is not a requirement of the Code. If the type species proves, upon closer examination, to belong to a pre-existing genus (a common occurrence), then all of the constituent species must be either moved into the pre-existing genus, or disassociated from the original type species and given a new generic name; the old generic name passes into synonymy and is abandoned unless there is a pressing need to make an exception (decided case-by-case, via petition to the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature).{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Type genus===
{{Main|Type genus}}
A type genus is that genus from which the name of a [[family (biology)|family]] or subfamily is formed. As with type species, the type genus is not necessarily the most representative, but is usually the earliest described, largest or best known genus. It is not uncommon for the name of a family to be based upon the name of a type genus that has passed into synonymy; the family name does not need to be changed in such a situation.

In [[computer science]], '''[[type conversion]]''', '''type casting''', and '''type coercion''' are different ways of changing an entity of one [[data type]] into another. An example would be the conversion of an [[integer (computer science)|integer]] value into a [[floating point]] value or its textual representation as a [[string (computer science)|string]], and vice versa. Type conversions can take advantage of certain features of [[type hierarchy|type hierarchies]] or [[data representation]]s. Two important aspects of a type conversion is whether it happens ''implicitly'' or ''explicitly'', and whether the underlying data representation is converted from one representation into another, or a given representation is merely ''reinterpreted'' as the representation of another data type. In general, both [[primitive data type|primitive]] and [[compound data type]]s can be converted.

Each [[programming language]] has its own rules on how types can be converted. Languages with [[strong typing]] typically do little implicit conversion and discourage the reinterpretation of representations, while languages with [[weak typing]] perform many implicit conversions between data types.  Weak typing language often allow forcing the [[compiler]] to arbitrarily interpret a data item as having different representations—this can be a non-obvious programming error, or a technical method to directly deal with underlying hardware.

In most languages, the word ''coercion'' is used to denote an ''implicit'' conversion, either during compilation or during [[run time (program lifecycle phase)|run time]]. For example, in an expression mixing integer and floating point numbers (like 5 + 0.1), the compiler will automatically convert integer representation into floating point representation so fractions are not lost. Explicit type conversions are either indicated by writing additional code (e.g. adding type identifiers or calling built-in [[Subroutine|routines]]) or by coding conversion routines for the compiler to use when it otherwise would halt with a type mismatch.

In most [[ALGOL]]-like languages, such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Modula-2]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[Delphi (programming language)|Delphi]], ''conversion'' and ''casting'' are distinctly different concepts. In these languages, ''conversion'' refers to either implicitly or explicitly changing a value from one data type storage format to another, e.g. a 16-bit integer to a 32-bit integer. The storage needs may change as a result of the conversion, including a possible loss of precision or truncation. The word ''cast'', on the other hand, refers to explicitly changing the ''interpretation'' of the ''bit pattern'' representing a value from one type to another. For example, 32 contiguous bits may be treated as an array of 32 booleans, a 4-byte string, an unsigned 32-bit integer or an IEEE single precision floating point value. Because the stored bits are never changed, the programmer must know low level details such as representation format, byte order, and alignment needs, to meaningfully cast.

In the C family of languages and [[ALGOL 68]], the word ''cast'' typically refers to an ''explicit'' type conversion (as opposed to an implicit conversion), causing some ambiguity about whether this is a re-interpretation of a bit-pattern or a real data representation conversion.  More important is the multitude of ways and rules that apply to what data type (or class) is located by a pointer and how a pointer may be adjusted by the compiler in cases like object (class) inheritance.

== Language comparison ==

===C-like languages===

====Implicit type conversion====
Implicit type conversion, also known as ''coercion'', is an automatic type conversion by the [[compiler]]. Some [[programming language]]s allow compilers to provide coercion; others require it.

In a mixed-type expression, data of one or more [[Subtyping|subtype]]s can be [[Type conversion in C|converted]] to a supertype as needed at [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime]] so that the program will run correctly. For example, the following is legal [[C (programming language)|C language]] code:

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
double  d;
long    l;
int     i;

if (d &gt; i)   d = i;
if (i &gt; l)   l = i;
if (d == l)  d *= 2;
&lt;/source&gt;

Although {{mono|'''d'''}}, {{mono|'''l'''}}, and {{mono|'''i'''}} belong to different data types, they will be automatically converted to equal data types each time a comparison or assignment is executed. This behavior should be used with caution, as [[unintended consequences]] can arise. Data can be lost when converting representations from floating-point to integer, as the fractional components of the floating-point values will be truncated (rounded toward zero). Conversely, precision can be lost when converting representations from integer to floating-point, since a floating-point type may be unable to exactly represent an integer type. For example, {{C-lang|float}} might be an [[IEEE 754]] single precision type, which cannot represent the integer 16777217 exactly, while a 32-bit integer type can. This can lead to unintuitive behavior, as demonstrated by the following code:

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
    int i_value   = 16777217;
    float f_value = 16777216.0;
    printf("The integer is: %d\n", i_value);
    printf("The float is:   %f\n", f_value);
    printf("Their equality: %d\n", i_value == f_value);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

On compilers that implement floats as IEEE single precision, and ints as at least 32 bits, this code will give this peculiar print-out:

&lt;source lang=C&gt;
    The integer is: 16777217
    The float is: 16777216.000000
    Their equality: 1
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that 1 represents equality in the last line above. This odd behavior is caused by an implicit conversion of {{C-lang|i_value}} to float when it is compared with {{C-lang|f_value}}. The conversion causes loss of precision, which makes the values equal before the comparison.

Important takeaways:

# {{C-lang|float}} to {{C-lang|int}} causes [[truncation]], i.e., removal of the fractional part.
# {{C-lang|double}} to {{C-lang|float}} causes rounding of digit.
# {{C-lang|long}} to {{C-lang|int}} causes dropping of excess higher order bits.

=====Type promotion=====
One special case of implicit type conversion is type promotion, where the compiler automatically expands the binary representation of objects of integer or floating-point types. Promotions are commonly used with types smaller than the native type of the target platform's [[arithmetic logic unit]] (ALU), before arithmetic and logical operations, to make such operations possible, or more efficient if the ALU can work with more than one type. C and C++ perform such promotion for objects of boolean, character, wide character, enumeration, and short integer types which are promoted to int, and for objects of type float, which are promoted to double. Unlike some other type conversions, promotions never lose precision or modify the value stored in the object.

In [[Java (programming language)|Java]]:
&lt;source lang=java&gt;
int x = 3;
double y = 3.5;
System.out.println(x+y); //The output will be 6.5
&lt;/source&gt;

====Explicit type conversion====
Explicit type conversion is a type conversion which is explicitly defined within a program (instead of being done by a compiler for implicit type conversion). It is defined by the user in the program.

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
double da = 3.3;
double db = 3.3;
double dc = 3.4;
int result = (int)da + (int)db + (int)dc; //result == 9
//if implicit conversion would be used (as with "result = da + db + dc"), result would be equal to 10
&lt;/source&gt;

There are several kinds of explicit conversion.

; checked: Before the conversion is performed, a runtime check is done to see if the destination type can hold the source value. If not, an error condition is raised.
; unchecked: No check is performed. If the destination type cannot hold the source value, the result is undefined.
; bit pattern: The raw bit representation of the source is copied verbatim, and it is re-interpreted according to the destination type. This can also be achieved via [[Aliasing (computing)|aliasing]].

In [[object-oriented programming]] languages, objects can also be [[downcasting|downcast]] : a reference of a base class is cast to one of its derived classes.

===C# and C++===
In [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], type conversion can be made in a safe or unsafe (i.e., C-like) manner, the former called ''checked type cast''.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=Csharp&gt;
Animal animal = new Cat();

Bulldog b = (Bulldog) animal;   // if (animal is Bulldog), stat.type(animal) is Bulldog, else an exception
b = animal as Bulldog;          // if (animal is Bulldog), b = (Bulldog) animal, else b = null

animal = null;
b = animal as Bulldog;          // b == null
&lt;/source&gt;

In [[C++]] the similar effect can be achieved using ''C++-style cast syntax''.

&lt;source lang=Cpp&gt;
Animal* animal = new Cat;

Bulldog* b = static_cast&lt;Bulldog*&gt;(animal); // compiles only if either Animal or Bulldog is derived from the other (or same)
b = dynamic_cast&lt;Bulldog*&gt;(animal);         // if (animal is Bulldog), b = (Bulldog*) animal, else b = nullptr

animal = nullptr;
b = dynamic_cast&lt;Bulldog*&gt;(animal);         // b == nullptr
&lt;/source&gt;

===Eiffel===

In [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] the notion of type conversion is integrated into the rules of the type system. The Assignment Rule says that an assignment, such as:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
 x := y
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
is valid if and only if the type of its source expression, &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; in this case, is ''compatible with'' the type of its target entity, &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in this case. In this rule, ''compatible with'' means that the type of the source expression either ''conforms to'' or ''converts to'' that of the target. Conformance of types is defined by the familiar rules for [[polymorphism in object-oriented programming]]. For example, in the assignment above, the type of &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; conforms to the type of &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; if the class upon which &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; is based is a descendant of that upon which &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is based.

====Definition of type conversion in Eiffel====
The actions of type conversion in Eiffel, specifically ''converts to'' and ''converts from'' are defined as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A type based on a class CU ''converts to'' a type T based on a class CT (and T ''converts from'' U) if either
:CT has a ''conversion procedure'' using U as a conversion type, or
:CU has a ''conversion query'' listing T as a conversion type
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Example====

Eiffel is a fully compliant [[List of CLI languages|language]] for Microsoft [[.NET Framework]]. Before development of .NET, Eiffel already had extensive class libraries. Using the .NET type libraries, particularly with commonly used types such as strings, poses a conversion problem. Existing Eiffel software uses the string classes (such as &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt;) from the Eiffel libraries, but Eiffel software written for .NET must use the .NET string class (&lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;System.String&lt;/code&gt;) in many cases, for example when calling .NET methods which expect items of the .NET type to be passed as arguments. So, the conversion of these types back and forth needs to be as seamless as possible.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
    my_string: STRING_8                 -- Native Eiffel string
    my_system_string: SYSTEM_STRING     -- Native .NET string

        ...

            my_string := my_system_string
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In the code above, two strings are declared, one of each different type (&lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;SYSTEM_STRING&lt;/code&gt; is the Eiffel compliant alias for System.String). Because &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;System.String&lt;/code&gt; does not conform to &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt;, then the assignment above is valid only if &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;System.String&lt;/code&gt; converts to &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt;.

The Eiffel class &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt; has a conversion procedure &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;make_from_cil&lt;/code&gt; for objects of type &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;System.String&lt;/code&gt;. Conversion procedures are also always designated as creation procedures (similar to constructors). The following is an excerpt from the &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt; class:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
    class STRING_8
        ...
    create
        make_from_cil
        ...
    convert
        make_from_cil ({SYSTEM_STRING})
        ...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The presence of the conversion procedure makes the assignment:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
            my_string := my_system_string
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

semantically equivalent to:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
            create my_string.make_from_cil (my_system_string)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

in which &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;my_string&lt;/code&gt; is constructed as a new object of type &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt; with content equivalent to that of &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;my_system_string&lt;/code&gt;.

To handle an assignment with original source and target reversed:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
            my_system_string := my_string
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

the class &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt; also contains a conversion query &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;to_cil&lt;/code&gt; which will produce a &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;System.String&lt;/code&gt; from an instance of &lt;code lang="eiffel"&gt;STRING_8&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
    class STRING_8
        ...
    create
        make_from_cil
        ...
    convert
        make_from_cil ({SYSTEM_STRING})
        to_cil: {SYSTEM_STRING}
        ...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The assignment:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
            my_system_string := my_string
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

then, becomes equivalent to:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="eiffel"&gt;
            my_system_string := my_string.to_cil
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In Eiffel, the setup for type conversion is included in the class code, but then appears to happen as automatically as [[#Explicit type conversion|explicit type conversion]] in client code. The includes not just assignments but other types of attachments as well, such as argument (parameter) substitution.

==Security issues==
In [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]], typecasting is the misuse of type conversion to temporarily change a [[variable (computer science)|variable]]'s data type from how it was originally defined.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Erickson ''Hacking, 2nd Edition: The Art of Exploitation'' 2008 1593271441 p51   "Typecasting is simply a way to temporarily change a variable's data type, despite how it was originally defined. When a variable is typecast into a different type, the compiler is basically told to treat that variable as if it were the new data type, but only for that operation. The syntax for typecasting is as follows: (typecast_data_type) variable ..."&lt;/ref&gt; This provides opportunities for hackers since in type conversion after a variable is "typecast" to become a different data type, the compiler will treat that hacked variable as the new data type for that specific operation.&lt;ref&gt;Arpita Gopal ''Magnifying C'' 2009 8120338618 p.59 "From the above, it is clear that the usage of typecasting is to make a variable of one type, act like another type for one single operation. So by using this ability of typecasting it is possible for create ASCII characters by typecasting integer to its ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

{{essay|date=January 2012}}
'''Verisimilitude''' (or '''truthlikeness''') is a philosophical concept that distinguishes between the relative and apparent (or seemingly so) [[truth]] and [[falsity]] of [[Logical assertion|assertion]]s and [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.cn.edu/kwheeler/lit_terms_V.html|title=Definition of Verisimilitude, Carson-Newman University|date=|accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of verisimilitude is the problem of articulating what it takes for one false [[Philosophical theory|theory]] to be closer to the truth than another false theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://public.wsu.edu/~campbelld/amlit/realism.htm|title=Realism in AmericanLiterature, 1860-1890, Washington State University|date=|accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://literarydevices.net/verisimilitude/|title=Definition of Verisimilitude, Literary Devices|date=|accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem was central to the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]] of [[Karl Popper]], largely because Popper was among the first to  affirm that truth is the aim of [[Models of scientific inquiry|scientific inquiry]] while acknowledging that most of the greatest scientific theories in the [[history of science]] are, strictly speaking, false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://philosophy.wisc.edu/forster/220/notes_10.html|title=The Problem of Verisimilitude, University of Wisconsin-Madison|date=|accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If this long string of purportedly false theories is to constitute progress with respect to the goal of truth, then it must be at least possible for one false theory to be closer to the truth than others.

==Karl Popper==
{{also|Karl Popper#Truth}}
Popper assumed that scientists are interested in highly informative theories, in part for methodological reasons—the more informative a theory, the easier it is to test, and the greater its predictive power. But clearly [[Occam's razor|informative power by itself is rather easy to come by, and we do not want to gain content by sacrificing truths]]. So Popper proposed that closeness to the truth is a function of two factors—truth and content. The more truths that a theory [[Logical consequence|entails]] (other things being equal) the closer it is to the truth. 

Intuitively at least, it seems that [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s theory of motion entails a good many more truths than does, say, [[Aristotle]]'s theory—despite the fact that both are known to have flaws. Even two true theories can have differing degrees of verisimilitude, depending on how much true information they deliver. For example, the claim "it will be raining on Thursday next week," if true, is closer to the truth than the true yet logically weaker claim "it will either be raining next Thursday or it will be sunny".

Popper's formal definition of verisimilitude was challenged since 1974 by [[Pavel Tichý]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Pavel Tichý]] |title=On Popper's Definitions of Verisimilitude |journal=[[The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=June 1974 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=155–160 |jstor=686819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pavel Tichý |title=Verisimilitude Redefined  |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |publisher= |location= |date=March 1976 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=25-42 |jstor=686376}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Henry Harris (philosopher)|John Henry Harris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[John Henry Harris (philosopher)|John H. Harris]] |title=Popper's Definitions of 'Verisimilitude' |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |date=June 1974 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=160-166 |jstor=686820}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[David Miller (philosopher)|David Miller]] |title=Popper's Qualitative Theory of Verisimilitude |journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science |date=June 1974 |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=166–177 |jstor=686821}}&lt;/ref&gt; who argued that Popper's definition has an [[unintended consequences|unintended consequence]]: that no false theory can be closer to the truth than another. Popper himself stated: "I accepted the criticism of my definition within minutes of its presentation, wondering why I had not seen the mistake before."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Karl Popper]] |editor=[[W. W. Bartley III]] |title=Realism and the Aim of Science. From the Postcript to the Logic of Scientific Discovery |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tlowU8nS2ygC&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2013 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=4L6GswEACAAJ 1983] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |isbn=1-1358-5895-0 |id={{ISBN|978-1-135-85895-7}} |page=[https://books.google.com/?id=tlowU8nS2ygC&amp;pg=PR36&amp;dq=%22I+accepted+the+criticism+of+my+definition+within+minutes+of+its+presentation,+wondering+why+I+had+not+seen+the+mistake+before%22 xxxvi]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This result gave rise to a search for an account of verisimilitude that did not deem progress towards the truth an impossibility.

==Post-Popperian theories==

Some of the new theories (e.g. those proposed by David Miller and by [[Theo Kuipers]]) build on Popper's approach, guided by the notion that truthlikeness is a function of a truth factor and a content factor. Others (e.g. those advanced by {{ill|Gerhard Schurz|de}} in collaboration with {{ill|Paul Weingartner|de}}, by Mortensen, and by [[Ken Gemes]]) are also inspired by Popper's approach but locate what they believe to be the error of Popper's proposal in his overly generous notion of content, or consequence, proposing instead that the consequences that contribute to closeness to truth must be, in a technical sense, "relevant". A different approach (already proposed by [[Pavel Tichý|Tichý]] and {{ill|Risto Hilpinen|fi}} and developed especially by [[Ilkka Niiniluoto]] and [[Graham Oddie]]) takes the "likeness" in truthlikeness literally, holding that a proposition's likeness to the truth is a function of the overall likeness to the actual world of the possible worlds in which the proposition would be true. An attempt to use the notion of point-free metric space is proposed by Giangiacomo Gerla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Graham |last=Oddie|title= Truthlikeness|work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truthlikeness/}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is currently a debate about whether or to what extent these different approaches to the concept are compatible.&lt;ref&gt; Zwart, S. D., and Franssen, M.: An impossibility theorem for verisimilitude. ''Synthese'', '''158''':1 (2007), 75&amp;ndash;92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Oddie, Graham (2013). The content, consequence and likeness approaches to verisimilitude: compatibility, trivialization, and underdetermination. ''Synthese'' '''190''' (9):1647-1687.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Gerla, G., 2007, "Point free geometry and verisimilitude of theories", Journal of Philosophical Logic, 36: 707–733.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
Another problem in Popper's theory of verisimilitude is the connection between truthlikeness as the goal of scientific progress, on the one hand, and methodology, on the other hand, as the ways in which we can to some extent ensure that scientific research actually approaches this goal.{{fact|date=April 2012}} Popper conceived of his definition as a justification of his own preferred methodology: [[falsificationism]], in the following sense: suppose theory A is closer to the truth than theory B according to Popper's qualitative definition of verisimilitude; in this case, we will (or should, if that definition had been logically sound) have that all true consequences of B (ie: all predicted consequences of theory B's mathematical and physical predictions subject to a particular set of initial conditions) are consequences of [theory] A (['s] similarly predicted consequences – i.e., informally, B ≤ A), and that all false consequences of A are consequences of B (in that those set of events deemed impossible by theory A are a subset of those events deemed impossible B, subject to the same initial data conditions for both – i.e., informally, ¬B ≥ ¬A, so that ¬A ≤ ¬B); this means that, if A and B are so related, then it should be the case that all ''known'' false [[Empirical research|empirical]] consequences of A also follow from B, and all ''known'' true empirical consequences of B do follow from A. So, if A were closer to the truth than B, then A should be better [[Corroboration|corroborated]] than B by any possible amount of [[empirical evidence]]. Lastly, this easy theorem allows interpretation of the fact that A is actually better corroborated than B as a ''corroboration of the hypothesis'' (or 'meta-hypothesis') that A is more verisimilar than B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5803">The '''von Restorff effect''', also known as the "'''isolation effect'''", predicts that when multiple homogeneous stimuli are presented, the stimulus that differs from the rest is more likely to be remembered.&lt;ref name="Parker1998"/&gt; The theory was coined by German psychiatrist and pediatrician [[Hedwig von Restorff]] (1906–1962), who, in her 1933 study, found that when participants were presented with a list of categorically similar items with one distinctive, isolated item on the list, memory for the item was improved.&lt;ref name="vonRestorff1933"/&gt;

The study utilized the '''isolation paradigm''', which refers to a distinctive feature of an item in a list that differs from the others by way of dimension. Such distinctiveness, leading to the von Restorff effect, can be generated from changing the meaningfulness or physical nature of the stimulus in some way, such as in size, shape, color, spacing and underlining.

== Examples ==
For example, if a person examines a shopping list with one item highlighted in bright green, he or she will be more likely to remember the highlighted item than any of the others.  Additionally, in the following list of words – desk, chair, bed, table, chipmunk, dresser, stool, couch – chipmunk will be remembered the most as it stands out against the other words in its meaning.

== Explanation ==
There are different theories proposed to explain the increased performance of isolated items.  The total-time hypothesis suggests that isolated items are rehearsed for a longer time in working memory compared to non-isolated items.  Another approach offers that subjects could consider the isolated items to be in their own special category in a free-recall task, making them easier to recollect.  A separate explanation is based upon the analysis of the deep processing of similarities and differences among the items.  
Debate surrounds whether perceptual salience and differential attention are necessary to produce this effect.  Modern theory holds that the contextual incongruity of the isolate is what leads to the differential attention to this item.  Based on this assumption, an isolation effect would not be expected if the isolated item were presented prior to some consistent context, a theory that goes against von Restorff's findings.&lt;ref name="Hunt1995"/&gt;

Empirical data has shown a strong relationship between the von Restorff effect and measures of [[event-related potential]] in the brain. Specifically, evidence has shown that exposure to novel or isolated items on a list for free recall generates an ERP with a larger amplitude and this amplitude in turn predicts a higher likelihood of future recall and faster recognition of the items.&lt;ref name="Karis1984"/&gt;

==Age==
There have been many studies that demonstrate and confirm the von Restorff effect in children and young adults. Another study found that college-aged students performed better when trying to remember an outstanding item in a list during an immediate memory-task whereas elderly individuals did not remember it well, suggesting a difference in processing strategies between the age groups.&lt;ref name="Bireta2008"/&gt;

In yet another study, although a significant von Restorff effect was produced amongst both age groups when manipulating font color, it was found to be smaller in older adults than younger adults. This too indicates that older people display lesser benefits for distinctive information compared to younger people.&lt;ref name="Cimbalo1982"/&gt;

'''Wheat Street Baptist Church''' is located at 359 Auburn Ave. in the [[Sweet Auburn]] neighborhood of [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. The building is part of the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Historic District]]; the church and its leader at the time, Rev. [[William Holmes Borders]], played a leading role in the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=English|first=James W. |title=The prophet of Wheat Street: the story of William Holmes Borders, a man who refused to fail|publisher=D.

James Bryant]] served as pastor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wheatstreet.org/?page_id=57 "Our History", 'Wheat Street Baptist Church]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Rights}}

'''Wind rights''' are rights relating to [[windmill]]s, [[wind turbine]]s and [[wind power]]. Historically in [[Continental Europe]] wind rights were manorial rights and obligations relating to the operation and profitability of windmills. In modern times, as wind becomes a more important source of power, rights relating to wind turbines and windmills are sometimes referred to as "wind rights".

== Low Countries ==

Historically, "wind rights" (Dutch: ''windrecht'') referred to a tax paid by [[miller]]s in large parts of the [[Low Countries]] before around 1800. The tax was paid on the "wind catch" (''windvang'') needed to turn a [[windmill]], but it was often based on the windmill's output.&lt;ref&gt; In the northern provinces, however, ancient wind rights were lacking. Government regulations only dated from the 17th century.

Prof. S. J. Fockema Andreae at Leiden University wrote an interesting article on this subject, entitled "Recht van den wind en molendwang", Tijdschrift voor rechtsgeschiedenis, Part 1, Issue 4, 1919, pp. 431-442, Haarlem.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|

This part of the article is an adapted translation of the article on ''windrecht'' at the Dutch version of Wikipedia.|group="N"}}

Since a windmill in a ''[[heerlijkheid]]'' was primarily the property of the lord (although leased out to a miller), wind rights were one way for a lord to discourage competition. In consideration for payment of this tax, the lord ensured that there were no wind obstructions around the mill by imposing a prohibition on buildings and high trees in the area. Another obligation imposed on residents was the "mill obligation" (''molendwang''), which required them to have their grain ground at the lord's mill. To a certain extent, this was another way for a lord to safeguard the income received from the mill.

Because of these rights and obligations, windmills had to be identifiable. They each had a name, traditionally the name of an animal. An image of the animal was placed on the mill so that even the [[Literacy|illiterate]] would know which mill was which.

In the Netherlands, wind rights and the mill obligations were ended around 1800 when a new constitution was introduced in the [[Batavian Republic]]. Similar concepts still exist in modern times. Since around 1973 the wind needed to turn a mill has been referred to as the "windmill [[biotope]]" (''molenbiotoop''). An area of {{convert|375|m|ft}} around a windmill is maintained as a "free zone" so that the windmill can have enough wind. For [[polder]] windmills, ensuring that windmills have enough wind is the responsibility of the [[Water board (The Netherlands)|water board]] (''waterschap'' or ''hoogheemraadschap''). However, this seldom takes priority over the desire of municipalities to build new housing.

== United States ==

In the United States, as a result of the increased interest in wind energy, developers or utilities purchase “wind rights" from landowners to allow the installation of one or more wind generators and an access road to the equipment in exchange for a payment to the landowner.&lt;ref&gt;
