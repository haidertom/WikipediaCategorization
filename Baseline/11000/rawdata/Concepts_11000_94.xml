      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14077">"'''A Defense of Abortion'''" is a [[Ethics|moral]] [[philosophy]] paper by [[Judith Jarvis Thomson]] first published in 1971. Granting for the sake of argument that the [[fetus]] has a [[right to life]], Thomson uses [[thought experiment]]s to argue that the fetus's right to life does not trump the pregnant woman's right to control her own body and its life-support functions, and that [[Abortion|induced abortion]] is therefore not morally impermissible. Her argument has many critics on both sides of the abortion debate,&lt;ref&gt;e.g., Schwarz 1990, Beckwith 1993 and Lee 1996 on the [[pro-life]] side; Tooley 1972, Warren 1973, Steinbock 1992 and McMahan 2002 on the [[pro-choice]] side&lt;/ref&gt; yet continues to receive defense.&lt;ref&gt;Kamm 1992; Boonin 2003: ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomson's imaginative examples and controversial conclusions have made "A Defense of Abortion" perhaps "the most widely reprinted essay in all of contemporary [[philosophy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Parent 1986: vii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of the essay==

===The violinist{{anchor|The_Violinist}}===

In "A Defense of Abortion", Thomson grants for the sake of argument that the fetus has a [[right to life]], but defends the permissibility of abortion by appeal to a [[thought experiment]]:
:You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious [[violin]]ist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right [[blood type]] to help. They have therefore [[kidnap]]ped you, and last night the violinist's [[circulatory system]] was plugged into yours, so that your [[kidneys]] can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. [If he is unplugged from you now, he will die; but] in nine months he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson 1971: 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson says that you can now permissibly unplug yourself from the violinist even though this will cause his death: this is due to limits on the right to life, which does not include the right to use another person's body, and so by unplugging the violinist you do not violate his right to life but merely deprive him of something&amp;mdash;the use of your body&amp;mdash;to which he has no right. "[I]f you do allow him to go on using your kidneys, this is a [[kindness]] on your part, and not something he can claim from you as his due."&lt;ref&gt;Thomson 1971: 55&lt;/ref&gt;

For the same reason, Thomson says, abortion does not violate the fetus's legitimate right to life, but merely deprives the fetus of something&amp;mdash;the non-consensual use of the [[pregnant]] woman's body and life-support functions&amp;mdash;to which it has no right. Thus, by choosing to terminate her pregnancy, Thomson concludes that a pregnant woman does not normally violate the fetus's right to life, but merely withdraws its use of her own body, which usually causes the fetus to die.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson 1971: 63; Boonin 2003: 133–134&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-party participation – the "expanding child"===

Thomson criticizes the common method of deducing a woman’s right to abort from the permissibility of a third party committing the abortion. In almost all instances, a woman’s right to abortion may hinge on the doctor’s willingness to perform it. If the doctor refuses, then the woman is denied her right. To base the woman’s right on the accordance or refusal of a doctor, she says, is to ignore the mother’s full personhood, and subsequently, her rights to her body.  Thomson presents the hypothetical example of the 'expanding child':
:Suppose you find yourself trapped in a tiny house with a growing child. I mean a very tiny house, and a rapidly growing child&amp;mdash;you are already up against the wall of the house and in a few minutes you’ll be crushed to death.  The child on the other hand won’t be crushed to death; if nothing is done to stop him from growing he’ll be hurt, but in the end he’ll simply burst open the house and walk out a free man.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson 1971: 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomson concedes that a third party indeed cannot make the choice to kill either the person being crushed or the child.  However, this does not mean that the person being crushed cannot act in self-defense and attack the child to save his or her own life.  To liken this to pregnancy, the mother can be thought to be the house, the fetus the growing-child.  In such a case, the mother’s life is being threatened, and the fetus is the one who threatens it.  Because for no reason should the mother’s life be threatened, and also for no reason is the fetus threatening it, both are innocent, and thus no third party can intervene. But, Thomson says, the person threatened can intervene, by which justification a mother can rightfully abort.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson 1971: 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing, Thomson returns to the 'expanding child' example and points out:
:For what we have to keep in mind is that the mother and the unborn child are not like two tenants in a small house, which has, by unfortunate mistake, been rented to both: the mother owns the house. The fact that she does adds to the offensiveness of deducing that the mother can do nothing from the supposition that third parties can do nothing.  But it does more than this: it casts a bright light on the supposition that third parties can do nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson 1971: 53&lt;/ref&gt;

If we say that no one may help the mother obtain an abortion, we fail to acknowledge the mother’s right over her body (or property). Thomson says that we are not personally obligated to help the mother but this does not rule out the possibility that someone else may act. As Thomson reminds, the house belongs to the mother; similarly, the body which holds a fetus also belongs to the mother.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson 1971: 54&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pregnancy resulting from voluntary intercourse – “people-seeds”===

To illustrate an example of pregnancy due to voluntary intercourse, Thomson presents the 'people-seeds' situation:
:Again, suppose it were like this: people-seeds drift about in the air like pollen, and if you 	open your windows, one may drift in and take root in your carpets or upholstery. You don’t want children, so you fix up your windows with fine mesh screens, the very best you can buy. As can happen, however, and on very, very rare occasions does happen, one of the screens is defective; and a seed drifts in and takes root.&lt;ref name="Thomson 1971: 59"&gt;Thomson 1971: 59&lt;/ref&gt;

Here, the people-seeds flying through the window represent conception, despite the precautionary mesh screen, which functions as contraception. The woman does not want a people-seed to root itself in her house, and so she even takes the measure to protect herself with the best mesh screens, and then voluntarily opens the windows. However, in the event that one people-seed finds its way through her window screens, unwelcome as it may be, does the simple fact that the woman knowingly risked such an occurrence when opening her window deny her the ability to rid her house of the intruder?  Thomson notes that some may argue the affirmative to this question, claiming that "...after all you could have lived out your life with bare floors and furniture, or with sealed windows and doors".&lt;ref name="Thomson 1971: 59"/&gt; But by this logic, she says, any woman could avoid [[pregnancy from rape|pregnancy due to rape]] by simply having a hysterectomy – an extreme procedure simply to safeguard against such a possibility.  Thomson concludes that although there may be times when the fetus ''does'' have a right to the mother's body, certainly in most cases the fetus does not have a right to the mother's body. This analogy raises the issue of whether all abortions are ''unjust'' killing.&lt;ref name="Thomson 1971: 59"/&gt;

=== Caveats ===
Thomson does not support unlimited abortion rights.  She gives as an example a hypothetical woman who seeks a late-term abortion "just to avoid the nuisance of postponing a trip abroad" and declares this to be "positively indecent".  

Thomson also explicitly rejects the claim that pregnant women have a right to kill their offspring.  She argues for the right of the mother to stop being pregnant, even if this results in the death of the offspring, but not for the right to ensure that the offspring is dead.  If, for example, a late-term abortion accidentally results in the birth of a living baby, then Thomson would conclude that the mother has no right to kill the baby.

==Criticism==

Critics of Thomson's argument generally grant the permissibility of unplugging the violinist, but seek to block the [[inference]] that abortion is permissible by arguing that there are morally relevant differences between the violinist scenario and typical cases of abortion.  One notable exception to this general agreement is [[Peter Singer]], who says that, despite our intuitions, a [[utilitarian]] calculus implies that one is morally obliged to stay connected to the violinist.&lt;ref&gt;Singer 2011:134&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common objection is that Thomson's violinist argument can justify abortion only in cases of [[rape]]. In the violinist scenario, the woman was kidnapped:  she did not consent to having the violinist plugged in and she did nothing to cause the violinist to be plugged in, just as a woman who is pregnant due to rape did nothing to cause her pregnancy. But in typical cases of abortion, the pregnant woman had intercourse voluntarily, and thus has either tacitly consented to allow the fetus to use her body (the ''tacit consent'' objection),&lt;ref name="Reftacit"&gt;e.g. Warren 1973; Steinbock 1992&lt;/ref&gt; or else has a duty to sustain the fetus because the woman herself caused the fetus to stand in need of her body (the ''responsibility'' objection).&lt;ref name="Refresponsibility"&gt;e.g. Beckwith 1993; McMahan 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Other common objections turn on the claim that the fetus is the pregnant woman's [[child]], whereas the violinist is a stranger (the ''stranger versus offspring'' objection),&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;e.g. Schwarz 1990; Beckwith 1993; McMahan 2002&lt;/ref&gt; or that abortion directly and intentionally kills the fetus, whereas unplugging the violinist merely lets him die of natural causes (the ''killing versus [[letting die]]'' objection).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Defenders of Thomson's argument&lt;ref&gt;Boonin 2003: 133–281&lt;/ref&gt; reply that the alleged disanalogies between the violinist scenario and typical cases of abortion do not matter, either because the factors that critics appeal to are not genuinely morally relevant, or because those factors are morally relevant but do not apply to abortion in the way that critics have claimed. Thomson's defenders also point to her 'people-seeds' argument as a strong analogy to typical cases of abortion.

Thomson's article, by positing a moral justification for abortion even if one grants a fetal right to life, opened up a new avenue in the philosophical debate about the ethics of abortion. Critics of her view have formulated many objections to her argument, and defenders have responded in kind in a back and forth that continues in philosophy journals even now.

The first, a [[1989 NFL season|1989]] [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]] in [[Texas Stadium|Dallas]], was noted for allegations that the Eagles put a $200 [[bounty (reward)|bounty]] on Cowboys [[placekicker|kicker]] [[Luis Zendejas]], who had been cut by Philadelphia earlier that season. The second was a rematch held two weeks later in Philadelphia. The Eagles, favored to win both games, swept the series.

The Cowboys/Eagles rivalry had been increasingly heated since the 1986 season, with [[Buddy Ryan]] arriving as the Eagles' head coach; the next year, during the NFL players' strike, the Cowboys (who were playing with a number of players that crossed picket lines) routed an Eagles squad filled with [[replacement player]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pro Football: Ryan Gets Revenge in the End|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 26, 1987|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-10-26/sports/sp-10877_1_buddy-ryan|accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan, believing that the Cowboys had [[running up the score|run up the score]] in poor form, responded in kind in the second game when the strike was over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=He's sure no Buddy to the Cowboys|work=Eugene Register-Guard|date=October 27, 1987|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L2kVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eeEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6695,6719706|accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1988 season, the Cowboys were sold to [[Jerry Jones]], who proceeded to gut the team and fire longtime head coach [[Tom Landry]] in preparation for rebuilding.

On November 23, 1989, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Dallas Cowboys 27–0. Following the game, which was broadcast on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], Cowboys head coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] alleged that Ryan had taken out a bounty on two of the former's players, kicker Luis Zendejas and quarterback [[Troy Aikman]]:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOW9oYaSQdg&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|I have absolutely no respect for the way they played the game, I would have said something to Buddy, but he wouldn't stand on the field long enough. He put his big, fat rear end into the dressing room.}}

Ryan denied the bounty accusation, saying that film of the game "show that Small had no intention of hurting Zendejas."&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt; The Philadelphia coach asserted it would have been in the Eagles' best interests to keep Zendejas in the game because he was in a slump.&lt;ref name=Ryan/&gt; Ryan also joked about Johnson's accusations:&lt;ref name=Ryan&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.philly.com/1989-11-25/sports/26136930_1_bounty-luis-zendejas-james-david-ryan | title = Despite Investigation, Buddy's Humor Bountiful | first = Tim | last = Kawakami | newspaper = [[Philadelphia Daily News]] | date = November 25, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|I resent that. I've been on a diet, I lost a couple of pounds, and I thought I was looking good.}}

When the Cowboys and Eagles met on Thanksgiving 25 years later, on November 27, 2014, Johnson joked that Ryan put up the bounty offer to keep his players interested since the Cowboys, who ultimately went 1-15, were so bad that year.&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Johnson mentioned in the first segment of [[Fox NFL Sunday]] on November 27, 2014. Johnson was an analyst on the show at the time.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zendejas spoke of having seen &lt;nowiki&gt;''Buddy call guys out and give them $100''&lt;/nowiki&gt; for what the kicker called a weekly Big Hit award but what Ryan called a Big Play award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/26/sports/sports-of-the-times-the-backfire-from-buddy-ryan-s-bounties.html|title=Sports of The Times; The Backfire From Buddy Ryan's 'Bounties'|last=Dave Anderson|date=1989-11-26|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This set of events set the stage for the scheduled rematch two weeks later in Philadelphia, dubbed "Bounty Bowl II."  As for the Eagles, they would not play another Thanksgiving game until the [[2008 NFL season]] when the Eagles faced the [[2008 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] in a preview of that season's NFC Championship Game.

The second game in the series took place on December 10, 1989, with NFL commissioner [[Paul Tagliabue]] in attendance. The game was anticipated as a media event. [[CBS Sports]] did a pre-game opening touting the contest as "Bounty Bowl II", complete with wanted posters, the involved players' pictures, and bounty amounts.

During the game, Eagles' [[700 Level|fans]] threw snowballs, ice, and beer onto the field. Several game participants were targeted, including back judge [[Al Jury]] and Cowboys punter [[Mike Saxon]] (both struck by snowballs), as well as Cowboys coach [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]], who was hit with objects as he was escorted off the field by the [[Philadelphia Police Department]]. Television announcers [[Verne Lundquist]] and [[Terry Bradshaw]] were also pelted with snowballs – Lundquist would claim on-air that a recent dental surgery had been less unpleasant than broadcasting a game in Philadelphia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSroPtp4jTI&amp;feature=related | title = 1989 Bounty Bowl II | publisher = YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; – and Eagles defensive lineman [[Jerome Brown]] was struck while standing on the sideline asking fans to cease throwing things.

Future [[Pennsylvania governor]] and Eagles fan [[Edward Rendell]] later admitted that he was involved in the incident. The then-former Philadelphia [[district attorney]] and future [[mayor of Philadelphia]] and [[governor of Pennsylvania]] bet another fan $20 that the latter couldn't reach the field with a snowball; Rendell lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/1769299/detail.html | title = Meet Ed Rendell: New Governor Led Philly Comeback | date = November 5, 2002 | location = Philadelphia | publisher = WTAE Pittsburgh, ThePittsburghChannel | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20021107010050/http://www.thepittsburghchannel.com/news/1769299/detail.html | archivedate = November 7, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eagles won the game 20–10. As a result of the incident, the Eagles added security and banned beer sales for their last home game of the year against the [[Phoenix Cardinals]] and the subsequent NFC wild-card playoff game versus the [[Los Angeles Rams]].

==Aftermath==

'''Porkchop Bowl'''
{{Main article|1990 Dallas Cowboys season#Porkchop Bowl}}
A third game in the heated rivalry took place the next season, known as the "Porkchop Bowl". The game got its name because Eagles head coach Buddy Ryan choked on a pork chop in the week leading up to the game. Philadelphia won this game as well, 21–20. 

'''Further coverage'''

In 2008 and on April 11, 2010, the game was included on a list of the ten most memorable moments in the history of [[Texas Stadium]] by [[ESPN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=luksa_frank&amp;page=hotread1/luksa | title = Legends, underdogs, goats shared Texas Stadium spotlight: Texas Stadium is entering its 37th and final season.

[[File:Rosa camuna R24 - Foppe - Nadro (Foto Luca Giarelli).jpg|''Camunian rose'' in loc. ''Foppe'' of [[Nadro]]|200px|thumb]]
[[File:Rosa camuna R2-3 - Carpene - Sellero (Foto Luca Giarelli).jpg|"Camunian rose" as [[swastika]] in loc. ''Carpene'' of [[Sellero]]|200px|thumb]]
The '''Camunian rose''' (or in Italian '''Rosa camuna''') is the name given to a particular symbol represented among the [[rock Drawings in Valcamonica|rock carvings]] of [[Val Camonica]] (Brescia, Italy). It consists of a meandering closed line that winds around nine [[Cup and ring mark|cup marks]]. It is engraved in the form symmetrical, asymmetrical or [[swastika]].

There are many theories about its meaning, [[Emmanuel Anati]] suggests that it might symbolize a complex religious concept, perhaps a solar symbol linked to the astral movement. In [[Val Camonica]] this motif dates back to the Iron Age, particularly from the 7th to 1st centuries BC. There is only one doubtful case datable at the Final [[Bronze Age]] (1,100 BC). These figures are placed mainly in the Middle Camonica Valley (Capo di Ponte, Foppe of [[Nadro]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Valcamonica preistorica - Guida ai parchi acheologici|first2=Emmanuel|last2=Anati|first1=Ariela|last1=Fradkin|year=2001|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sellero]], Ceto and [[Paspardo]]), but numerous cases are in the Low Valley too ([[Darfo Boario Terme]] and Esine).

[[File:Rosa camuna svastika vite57.jpg|thumb| Camunian rose in the swastika shape on the rock 57 of Vite, Paspardo]]
The motif has been deeply studied by Paola Farina, who created a corpus of all the "camunian roses" known in Val Camonica: she counted 84 "roses" engraved on 27 rocks. Three basic types have been determined:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rupestre.net/tracce/?p=1366 Farina, Paola (1997). ''The motif of the “Camunnian Rose” in the Rock Art of Valcamonica (Italy)*'', TRACCE Online Rock Art Bulletin 7, May 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;
# swastika type: the 9 cup-marks make a 5 by 5 cross; the contour forms four arms that bend about 90° and every arm includes one of the top cup-marks of the cross. There are 16 “roses” of this type;
# asymmetric-swastika type: the disposition of the 9 cup-marks is the same as the previous; but the contour is different, because only two arms bend 90°, while the other ones join together in a single bilobate arm. There are 12 “roses” of this type;
# quadrilobate type: the 9 cup-marks are aligned in three columns of three cups; the contour develops into four orthogonal and symmetric arms, and everyone includes a cup-mark. It is the more widespread type of “camunian rose”, there are 56 examples.

Regarding the interpretation, not easy for a symbol pertaining to a lost and past culture, Paola Farina suggests that the "Camunian rose" had originally a solar meaning, which then developed into a wider meaning of a positive power, to bring life and good luck.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rupestre.net/tracce/?p=1782 Farina, Paola (1998). ''The motif of the “Camunnian Rose” in the Rock Art of Valcamonica (Italy)**'', TRACCE Online Rock Art Bulletin 10, May 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbol is called in Italian "rosa camuna" (camunian rose) because it looks like a [[flower]], but this name is a modern invention. A stylized "camunian rose" has become the symbol of the [[Lombardy]] Region.

The weeklong clashes resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people, thousands by some accounts, mostly at the hands of security forces and the military.&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UN, VENEZUELA: Wound Still Gaping 20 Years after ‘Caracazo’, By Humberto Márquez, CARACAS, Feb 27 2009 (IPS),http://www.ipsnews.net/2009/02/venezuela-wound-still-gaping-20-years-after-lsquocaracazorsquo/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;[[Amnesty International]], March 1990, Reports of Arbitrary Killings and Torture:, February/March 1989 , AI Index: AMR 53/02/90, https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr53/002/1991/en/&lt;/ref&gt; The riots and the protests began mainly in response to the government's economic reforms and the resulting increase in the price of gasoline and transportation.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''Caracazo'' is the name of the city followed by the [[Spanish nouns#Other suffixes|''-azo'' suffix]], which denotes a violent knock. Its translation could therefore be "the Caracas smash" or "the big one in Caracas". The name was inspired by the ''[[Bogotazo]]'', a massive riot in neighboring [[Colombia]] in 1948, which played a pivotal role in that country's history. ''Sacudón'' is from ''sacudir'' (to shake) and means something along the lines of "the day that shook the country" (see [[Spanish nouns#Other suffixes|Spanish nouns: Other suffixes]]).

The words are pronounced {{IPA-es|kaɾaˈkaso|}} and {{IPA-es|sakuˈðon|}}, respectively.

==Background==
A fall in oil prices in the mid-1980s caused an economic crisis to take hold in Venezuela, and the country had accrued significant levels of debt. Nevertheless, the administration of the [[political left|left]]-leaning President [[Jaime Lusinchi]] was able to restructure the country's debt repayments and offset an economic crisis but allow for the continuation of the government's policies of social spending and state-sponsored subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barcelona Centre for International Affairs]], Jaime Lusinchi, (Spanish) http://www.cidob.org/es/documentacion/biografias_lideres_politicos/america_del_sur/venezuela/jaime_lusinchi#2&lt;/ref&gt;

Lusinchi's political party, the [[Democratic Action]], was able to remain in power following the 1988 election of [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]] as president. Pérez then proposed a major shift in policy by implementing [[neoliberal]] economic reforms recommended by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF). The program, called ''El Gran Viraje'' (The Great Turn), but popularly known as the ''paquete'' (the "package"), was contrary to statements made during Pérez's populist campaign in which he had described the IMF as "a neutron bomb that killed people, but left buildings standing."&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2040189,00.html Carlos Andrés Pérez, Obituary], Time Magazine, Jan. 10 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Measures taken by Pérez included privatizing state companies, tax reform, reducing customs duties, and diminishing the role of the state in the economy. He also took measures to decentralize and modernize the Venezuelan political system by the direct election of state governors, who had previously been appointed by the president. The most controversial part of the economic reform package was the elimination of the gasoline subsidies, which had long maintained domestic gasoline prices far beneath international levels and even the production costs.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} When the subsidy was eliminated, gasoline prices rose by as much as 100% and so the costs of public transportation rose by 30%.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Weeks before the outbreak of rioting, Carlos Andrés Pérez was inaugurated on 2 February 1989. During the "lavish ceremony", [[Fidel Castro]] and other Cuban personnel entered Venezuela for the event. With Cuba recently entering its [[Special Period]], experiencing economic difficulties as a result of the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[Perestroika]], Castro allegedly sought to establish an ally in Venezuela so Cuba could also enjoy funds oil profits. The group of Cubans allegedly established a headquarters at the nearly finished Eurobuilding Hotel in Caracas and after the event, Venezuelan intelligence reported that less Cuban personnel departed from Venezuela than arrived. Cuban sleeper agents then allegedly waited for unrest to occur in Venezuela so they could exacerbate political tensions.&lt;ref name="DELFINcoro"/&gt;

==Protests and rioting==
[[File:Caracazo looting 2.png|250px|thumb|right|Looters running through the streets with stolen goods]]
The protests and rioting began on the morning of February 27, 1989, in [[Guarenas]], a town in [[Miranda State]] about {{convert|30|km}} east of Caracas, by the steep increase in public transportation prices.&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IACtHR&gt;[http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/iachr/C/58-ing.html El Caracazo Case, Judgment of 11 November 1999], Inter-American Court of Human Rights, accessed 1 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The protests and rioting quickly spread to the capital and other towns across the country. A lack of timely intervention by authorities - some police were under orders not to take action - led to the Metropolitan Police quickly being overwhelmed.&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt; Despite initial debate within the government over how to manage the situation, a heavyhanded approach was implemented, with a [[state of emergency]] and [[martial law]] being imposed.&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt;

On February 28, Pérez suspended a number of articles of the Constitution, including Article 60 (right to individual liberty and security), Article 62 (inviolability of the home), Article 66 (freedom of expression), Article 71 (right to gather publicly and privately), and Article 115 (right to peaceful protest).&lt;ref name=Crisp&gt;Crisp, Brian F. (1998), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=2k9iI91GVt4C&amp;pg=PA150 Presidential Decree Authority in Venezuela]", in John M. Carey and Matthew Soberg Shugart (eds, 1998), ''Executive decree authority'', [[Cambridge University Press]]. p150&lt;/ref&gt; The rights were not completely restored until March 22, and in the interim, there was no official decree or resolution to define how government authority would be exercised in the absence of those constitutional rights.&lt;ref name=Crisp/&gt;

[[File:Caracazo fire.png|250px|thumb|left|Smoke billowing from fires throughout Caracas]] 
[[File:Caracazo riot 2.png|250px|thumb|right|Large crowds of people gather during the rioting]]

By the time authorities encountered the scenes of rioting, citizens began firing weapons at officers, with ensuing firefights resulted in many bystanders being killed by "bullets from army troops and from sniping protesters".&lt;ref name="GAZ5"&gt;{{cite news|title=Riots leave Venezuela short of coffins; Up to 700 reported dead while hospitals say most of the injured were shot: B1|work=[[Montreal Gazette|The Gazette]]|date=5 March 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucdp.uu.se"/&gt; In many poor areas, citizens destroyed their own local commercial facilities, with food markets so damaged that their food distribution system was ruined.&lt;ref name="GAZ5"/&gt; Much of the rioters destroyed properties indiscriminately, with no motives related to initial protests.&lt;ref name="GAZ5"/&gt; According to [[Amnesty International]], tactics used by security forces included "disappearances," the use of torture, and extrajudicial killings.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; As part of the government's security forces, members of [[Hugo Chávez]]'s [[MBR-200]] allegedly participated in the crackdown.&lt;ref name=NELSON&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Brian A.|title=The silence and the scorpion: the coup against Chávez and the making of modern Venezuela|date=2009|publisher=Nation Books|location=New York|isbn=1568584180|page=24|edition=online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chávez himself was sick that day with the [[measles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Hugo Chávez: Oil, Politics, and the Challenge to the U.S.|last = Kozloff|first = Nikolas|publisher = Palgrave Macmillan|year = 2007|isbn = 9781403984098|location = |pages = 45}}&lt;/ref&gt; As tensions eased, troops began to sweep through neighborhoods collecting appliances and cash registers, telling citizens that if they provided a certificate of purchase, the items would be returned.&lt;ref name="GAZ5"/&gt;

The initial official pronouncements said 276 people had died&lt;ref name=IACtHR/&gt; but many estimates put the number at above 2,000.&lt;ref name=Crisp2&gt;Crisp, Brian F. (1998), "[https://books.google.com/books?id=2k9iI91GVt4C&amp;pg=PA150 Presidential Decree Authority in Venezuela]", in John M. Carey and Matthew Soberg Shugart (eds, 1998), ''Executive decree authority'', [[Cambridge University Press]]. p157&lt;/ref&gt; Shortages of coffins were reported and many Venezuelans had to line up at government food distribution centers since markets were destroyed by rioters.&lt;ref name="GAZ5"/&gt; Insurance estimates of damage caused during the rioting were $90 million CAD ($120 million 2017 USD).&lt;ref name="GAZ5"/&gt;

==Aftermath and consequences==
On March 3, 1989, Pérez spoke with U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]]. President Bush offered President Pérez a US$450 million emergency loan. Pérez thanked Bush and asked him to support a change in debt policy toward Latin America: "I want to tell you if there is no change in [international] debt policy then whatever we may do here may be useless."&lt;ref name="bushlibrary.tamu.edu"&gt;Bush Presidential Library, 3 March 1989, Memcons and Telcons, http://bushlibrary.tamu.edu/research/pdfs/memcons_telcons/1989-03-03--Perez.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Pérez told Bush that he had sent him a letter several days earlier and that he would appreciate it if he would read it.&lt;ref name="bushlibrary.tamu.edu"/&gt;

===Political instability===
The clearest consequence of the ''Caracazo'' was political instability. The following February, the army was called to contain similar riots in [[Puerto La Cruz]] and [[Barcelona, Venezuela|Barcelona]] and again in June, when rising of transportation costs ended in riots in [[Maracaibo]] and other cities. The reforms were modified.

The MBR-200 repudiated the Caracazo and accelerated its preparation for a [[coup d'état]] against the Perez government.&lt;ref name=HELLINGER&gt;{{Cite book|title = Comparative Politics of Latin America: Democracy at Last?|last = Hellinger|first = Daniel|publisher = Routledge|year = 2014|isbn = 9781134070077}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 there were two attempted coups in [[Venezuelan coup attempt of 1992|February and November]]. Pérez was later accused of corruption and removed from the presidency. Chávez, a MBR-200 leader and an organiser of one of the coups, was found guilty of sedition and incarcerated. However, he was subsequently pardoned by Pérez's successor, [[Rafael Caldera]], and he went on to be elected president after the latter. Chavez later explained that after the event, "the members of the MBR 200 realized we had passed the point of no return and we had to take up arms. We could not continue to defend a murderous regime."&lt;ref name=HELLINGER/&gt;

===Investigations===
[[File:Caracazo military response.png|250px|thumb|right|Military response to the rioting.]]
In 1998, the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] condemned the government's action and referred the case to the [[Inter-American Court of Human Rights]]. In 1999, the Court heard the case and found that the government had committed violations of [[human rights]], including extrajudicial killings.

The '''Chicago principles''' are a set of guiding principles intended to demonstrate a commitment to [[freedom of speech]] and freedom of expression on college campuses in the United States. Initially adopted by the [[University of Chicago]] following a report issued by a designated Committee on Freedom of Expression in 2014 (''″Report of the Committee on Freedom of Expression″'')&lt;ref name="FOECReport_2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://provost.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/documents/reports/FOECommitteeReport.pdf|title=Report of the Committee on Freedom of Expression|last1=Zimmer|first1=Robert J.|last2=Isaacs|first2=Eric D.|website=uchicago.edu|publisher=ommittee on Freedom of Expression at the University of Chicago|accessdate=31 July 2018|last3=(et al.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;, they came to be known as the “Chicago principles” after other universities across the country committed to the principles or modelled their own based on similar goals.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/ct-purdue-chicago-principles-free-speech-20150523-story.html|title=Purdue adopts 'Chicago principles' to protect free speech|last=|first=|date=3 May 2015|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=2017-03-29|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 2014, several other universities have committed to the principles, including [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Purdue University|Purdue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mag.uchicago.edu/university-news/opening-inquiry|title=Opening inquiry {{!}} The University of Chicago Magazine|website=mag.uchicago.edu|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/15/purdue-free-speech-chicago-principles_n_7278716.html|title=Purdue Takes A Stand For Free Speech, No Matter How Offensive Or Unwise|last=Kingkade|first=Tyler|date=2015-05-15|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of September 2018, the [[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education]] reported that 45 American colleges and universities had "adopted or endorsed the Chicago Statement or a substantially similar statement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefire.org/chicago-statement-university-and-faculty-body-support/|title=Chicago Statement: University and Faculty Body Support|website=www.thefire.org|date=2018-08-31|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Context and formulation ==
In July 2014, the University of Chicago formed the ‘University of Chicago's Committee on Freedom of Expression’ after a series of incidents where students at various schools sought to prevent controversial commencement speakers that year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The committee returned a report which re-emphasized the school’s commitment to principles of free expression as “an essential element of the University’s culture.” The University's commitment to free speech gained national media attention in August 2016, when Dean of Students John Ellison sent a letter to the incoming freshman class of 2020 affirming the free speech principles and stating that the University did not support the use of [[trigger warnings]] or [[safe spaces]]. 

In adopting the principles, Purdue president, [[Mitch Daniels]] later said “we didn’t see how we could improve on the language.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7600">A '''circannual cycle''' is a biological process that occurs in living creatures over the period of approximately one year. This cycle was first discovered by Ebo Gwinner and Canadian biologist Ted Pengelley.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is classified as an [[Infradian rhythm]], which is biological process with a period longer than that of a circadian rhythm, less than one cycle per 28 hours. These processes continue even in artificial environments in which seasonal cues have been removed by scientists.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Circannual rhythm - Oxford Reference|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095613678|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term circannual is Latin, [[circa]] meaning approximately and [[wikt:annual|annual]] relating to one year. [[Chronobiology]] is the field of biology pertaining to periodic rhythms that occur in living organisms in response to external stimuli such as [[Photoperiodism|photoperiod]].

The location of the physical circannual timer in organisms and how it works are almost entirely unknown.

== Examples ==
In one study performed by Eberhard Gwinner, two species of birds were born in a controlled environment without ever being exposed to external stimuli. They were presented with a fixed [[Photoperiodism|Photoperiod]] of 10 hours of light and 14 hours of darkness each day. The birds were exposed to these conditions for eight years and consistently molted at the same time as they would have in the wild, indicating that this physiological cycle is innate rather than governed environmentally.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chelonia.org/Articles/Biological_clocks.htm|title=Circannual Rhythms, Seasonal Change, Climate and Stress - Darrell Senneke|website=www.chelonia.org|access-date=2017-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers Ted Pengelley and Ken Fisher studied the circannual clock in the golden-mantled ground squirrel. They exposed the squirrels to twelve hours of light and 12 hours of darkness and at a constant temperature for three years. Despite this constant cycle, they continued to hibernate once a year with each episode preceded by an increase in body weight and food consumption. During the first year, the squirrels began hibernation in late October. They started hibernating in mid August and early April respectively for the following two years, displaying a circannual rhythm with a period of about 10 months.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Foster RG, Kreitzman L. Seasons of life: The biological rhythms that enable living things to thrive and survive 1-303.&amp;nbsp;New Haven (Connecticut): Yale University Press.&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|9780300115567}}. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A classic example in insects is the [[varied carpet beetle]].

== Biological advantages ==
Generating  biological rhythms internally helps organisms anticipate important changes in the environment before they occur, thus providing the organisms with time to prepare and survive.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, some plants have a very strict time frame in regards to blooming and preparing for spring. If they begin their preparations too early or too late they risk not being pollinated, competing with different species, or other factors that might affect their survival rate. Having a circannual cycle may keep them from making this mistake if a particular geographic region experiences a false spring, where the weather becomes exceptionally warm early for a short period of time before returning to winter temperatures.

Similarly, bird plumage and mammal fur change with the approach of winter, and is triggered by the shortening photoperiod of autumn.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gwinner|first=Eberhard|date=1996|title=Circannual Clocks in Avian Reproduction and Migration|url=|journal=Ibis|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|volume=138|pages=47–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The circannual cycle can also be useful for animals that [[Animal migration|Migrate]] or [[Hibernation|Hibernate]]. Many animals' reproductive organs change in response to changes in photoperiod. Male gonads will grow during the onset of spring to promote reproduction among the species. These enlarged gonads would be nearly impossible to keep year round and would be inefficient for the species. Many female animals will only produce eggs during certain times of the year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Interaction with changing climate ==
Changing climate may unravel ecosystems in which different organisms use different internal calendars. Warming temperatures may lead to earlier blooms of flora in spring. For instance, one study performed by Menzel et al., analyzed 125,000 phenological records of 542 plant species in 21 European countries from 1971 to 2000 and found that 78% of all plants studied advanced in flowering, leafing, and fruiting while only three percent were significantly delayed. They determined that the average advance of spring and summer was 2.5 days per decade in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Menzel|first=et al.,|date=2006|title=European Phenological Response to Climate Change Matches the Warming Pattern|url=|journal=Global Change Biology|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|volume=12|pages=1969–1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, fauna may breed or migrate based on the length of day, and thus might arrive too late for critical food supplies they co-evolved with.

For example, the [[Parus major]] closely times the hatching of their chicks to the emergence of the protein-rich winter moth caterpillar, which in turn hatches to meet the budding of oaks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These birds are a single-brood bird, meaning they breed once a year with about nine chicks per brood. If the birds and caterpillars and buds all emerge at the right time, the caterpillars eat the new oak leaves and their population increases dramatically, and this hopefully will coincide with the arrival of the new chicks, allowing them to eat. But if plants, insects, and birds respond differently to the advance of spring or other [[phenology]] changes, the relationship may be altered.

As another example, studies of the Pied Flycatcher ([[ficedula hypoleuca]]) have shown that their spring migration timing is triggered by an internal circannual clock that is fine tuned to day length.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These particular birds overwinter in dry tropical forest in Western Africa and breed in temperate forests in Europe, over 4,500&amp;nbsp;km away. From 1980-2000, temperatures at the time of arrival and the start of breeding have warmed significantly. They have advanced their mean laying date by ten days, but have not advanced the spring arrival on their breeding grounds because their migration behavior is triggered by photoperiod rather than temperature.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In short, even if each individual species can easily live with elevated temperatures, disruptions of [[phenology]] timing at ecosystem level may still imperil them.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Challenges for scientific study ==
One reason for the paucity of research on circannual cycles is the duration of required efforts. The ratio of the period length of a circannual cycle to the length of the productive life of a scientist makes this branch of chronobiology difficult.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It takes an entire year to get a time series which makes it difficult to see how these cycles adjust over the years. To put this into perspective, a two-week experiment for a circadian biologist would take fourteen years for a circannual researcher, in order to achieve the same level of data robustness for the conclusions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12730">In [[combinatorics]], a '''Davenport–Schinzel sequence''' is a [[sequence]] of symbols in which the number of times any two symbols may appear in alternation is limited. The maximum possible length of a Davenport–Schinzel sequence is bounded by the number of its distinct symbols multiplied by a small but nonconstant factor that depends on the number of alternations that are allowed. Davenport–Schinzel sequences were first defined in 1965 by [[Harold Davenport]] and [[Andrzej Schinzel]] to analyze [[linear differential equation]]s. Following {{harvtxt|Atallah|1985}} these sequences and their length bounds have also become a standard tool in [[discrete geometry]] and in the analysis of [[Computational geometry|geometric algorithms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sharir|Agarwal|1995}}, pp. x and 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A finite sequence ''U'' = ''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''u''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is said to be a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order ''s'' if it satisfies the following two properties:
#No two consecutive values in the sequence are equal to each other.
#If ''x'' and ''y'' are two distinct values occurring in the sequence, then the sequence does not contain a subsequence ... ''x'', ... ''y'', ..., ''x'', ..., ''y'', ... consisting of ''s''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;2 values alternating between ''x'' and ''y''.

For instance, the sequence
:1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 4, 5, 2, 3
is a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order 3: it contains alternating subsequences of length four, such as ...1, ... 2, ... 1, ... 2, ... (which appears in four different ways as a subsequence of the whole sequence) but it does not contain any alternating subsequences of length five.

If a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order ''s'' includes ''n'' distinct values, it is called an (''n'',''s'') Davenport–Schinzel sequence, or a ''DS''(''n'',''s'')-sequence.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Sharir|Agarwal|1995}}, p. 1, for this notation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Length bounds==
The complexity of ''DS''(''n'',''s'')-sequence has been analyzed [[asymptotics|asymptotically]] in the limit as ''n'' goes to infinity, with the assumption that ''s'' is a fixed constant, and nearly tight bounds are known for all ''s''. Let λ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') denote the length of the longest ''DS''(''n'',''s'')-sequence. The best bounds known on λ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt; involve the [[Ackermann function#Inverse|inverse Ackermann function]]
:&amp;alpha;(''n'') = min { ''m'' | ''A''(''m'',''m'') ≥ ''n'' },
where ''A'' is the Ackermann function. Due to the very rapid growth of the Ackermann function, its inverse α grows very slowly, and is at most four for problems of any practical size.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sharir|Agarwal|1995}}, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[big O notation|big O and big &amp;Theta; notation]], the following bounds are known:
*&lt;math&gt;\lambda_0(n)=1&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1(n)=n&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="DS12"&gt;{{harvtxt|Sharir|Agarwal|1995}}, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\lambda_2(n)=2n-1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="DS12" /&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\lambda_3(n) = 2n\alpha(n)+O(n)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sharir|Agarwal|1995}}, Chapter 2, pp. 12–42; {{harvtxt|Hart|Sharir|1986}}; {{harvtxt|Komjáth|1988}}; {{harvtxt|Klazar|1999}}; {{harvtxt|Nivasch|2009}}; {{harvtxt|Pettie|2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This complexity bound can be realized to within a factor of 2 by line segments: there exist arrangements of ''n'' line segments in the plane whose lower envelopes have complexity Ω(''n''&amp;nbsp;α(''n'')).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sharir|Agarwal|1995}}, Chapter 4, pp. 86–114; {{harvtxt|Wiernik|Sharir|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\lambda_4(n) = \Theta(n2^{\alpha(n)})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sharir|Agarwal|1995}}, Chapter 3, pp. 43–85; {{harvtxt|Agarwal|Sharir|1989}}; {{harvtxt|Nivasch|1999}}; {{harvtxt|Pettie|2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\lambda_5(n) = \Theta(n\alpha(n)2^{\alpha(n)})&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Pettie|2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*For both even and odd values of ''s'' ≥ 6,
::&lt;math&gt;\lambda_s(n)=n\cdot 2^{\frac{1}{t!}\alpha(n)^t + O(\alpha(n)^{t-1})}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t = \left\lfloor\frac{s-2}{2}\right\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Sharir|Agarwal|1995}}, Chapter 3, pp. 43–85; {{harvtxt|Agarwal|Sharir|1989}}; {{harvtxt|Nivasch|1999}}; {{harvtxt|Pettie|2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The value of λ&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is also known when ''s'' is variable but ''n'' is a small constant:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Roselle|Stanton|1970/71}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_s(1)=1\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_s(2)=s+1\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_s(3)=3s-2+(s\, \bmod \, 2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_s(4)=6s-2+(s\, \bmod\, 2).&lt;/math&gt;

When ''s'' is a function of ''n'' the upper and lower bounds on Davenport-Schinzel sequences are not tight.
*When &lt;math&gt;s &gt; n^{1/t}(t-1)!&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_s(n) = \Omega(n^2s/(t-1)!)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda_s(n) = O(n^2s)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Roselle|Stanton|1970/71}}; {{harvtxt|Wellman|Pettie|2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*When &lt;math&gt;\log\log n &lt; s = n^{o(1)}&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\lambda_s(n) = \Omega\left(n\left(\frac{s}{2\log\log_s n}\right)^{\log\log_s n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wellman|Pettie|2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*When &lt;math&gt;s \le \log\log n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\lambda_s(n) = \Omega(n2^s)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Wellman|Pettie|2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to lower envelopes==
[[Image:Line segment lower envelope.svg|thumb|300px|A Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order 3 formed by the lower envelope of line segments.]]
The ''lower envelope'' of a set of functions ƒ&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') of a [[Function of a real variable|real variable]] ''x'' is the function given by their pointwise minimum:
:&amp;fnof;(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;min&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;fnof;&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'').
Suppose that these functions are particularly well behaved: they are all [[continuous function|continuous]], and any two of them are equal on at most ''s'' values. With these assumptions, the real line can be partitioned into finitely many [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]] within which one function has values smaller than all of the other functions. The sequence of these intervals, labeled by the minimizing function within each interval, forms a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order ''s''. Thus, any upper bound on the complexity of a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of this order also bounds the number of intervals in this representation of the lower envelope.

In the original application of Davenport and Schinzel, the functions under consideration were a set of different solutions to the same homogeneous [[linear differential equation]] of order ''s''. Any two distinct solutions can have at most ''s'' values in common, so the lower envelope of a set of ''n'' distinct solutions forms a ''DS''(''n'',''s'')-sequence.

The same concept of a lower envelope can also be applied to functions that are only [[piecewise]] continuous or that are defined only over intervals of the real line; however, in this case, the points of discontinuity of the functions and the endpoints of the interval within which each function is defined add to the order of the sequence. For instance, a non-vertical line segment in the plane can be interpreted as the [[graph of a function]] mapping an interval of ''x'' values to their corresponding ''y'' values, and the lower envelope of a collection of line segments forms a Davenport–Schinzel sequence of order three because any two line segments can form an alternating subsequence with length at most four.

 NOTE TO POTENTIAL EDITORS: "Defence" is the correct spelling of the word in British English, and should be maintained throughout the article, as it is used as such in the title. Please do not change "defence" to the American English spelling, "defense", as this goes against WP:LANGVAR. See also WP:RETAIN / WP:CONSISTENCY and MOS:QUOTE.

A '''defence mechanism''' is an [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] psychological mechanism that reduces anxiety arising from unacceptable or potentially harmful stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schacter |first=Daniel L. |title=Psychology Second Edition |year=2011 |publisher=Worth Publishers |location=41 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10010 |isbn=978-1-4292-3719-2 |pages=482–483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defence mechanisms may result in healthy or unhealthy consequences depending on the circumstances and frequency with which the mechanism is used.&lt;ref name=utah&gt;[http://www.utahpsych.org/defensemechanisms.htm Utah Psych. "Defense Mechanisms"] 2010. Retrieved on 05 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[psychoanalytic theory]], defence mechanisms ({{lang-de|Abwehrmechanismen}}) are psychological strategies brought into play by the [[unconscious mind]]&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Defense+Mechanisms}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Psychological manipulation|manipulate]], [[denial|deny]], or distort reality in order to defend against feelings of anxiety and unacceptable impulses and to maintain one's [[self-schema]] or other [[Schema (psychology)|schema]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.med.yale.edu/psych/3s/self_schema.html |title=archive of: www.3-S.us What is a self-schema? |publisher=Info.med.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204225215/http://info.med.yale.edu/psych/3s/self_schema.html |archivedate=February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These processes that manipulate, deny, or distort reality may include the following: '''[[Psychological repression|repression]]''', or the burying of a painful feeling or thought from one's awareness even though it may resurface in a symbolic form;&lt;ref name=utah/&gt; '''[[Identification (psychology)|identification]]''', incorporating an object or thought into oneself;&lt;ref&gt;Chalquist, Craig.

Healthy persons normally use different defences throughout life. An [[Human ego|ego]] defence mechanism becomes pathological only when its persistent use leads to maladaptive behaviour such that the physical or mental health of the individual is adversely affected. Among the purposes of ego defence mechanisms is to protect the mind/self/ego from [[anxiety]] or social sanctions or to provide a refuge from a situation with which one cannot currently cope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9029737/defence-mechanism |title=defence mechanisms --  Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=www.britannica.com |accessdate=2008-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One resource used to evaluate these mechanisms is the ''Defense Style Questionnaire'' (DSQ-40).&lt;ref name="pmid16477187"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruuttu T, Pelkonen M, Holi M |title=Psychometric properties of the defense style questionnaire (DSQ-40) in adolescents |journal=J.

== Structural model: Id, ego, and superego ==
[[File:Freud 420a.jpg|thumb|Sigmund Freud]]
The concept of id impulses comes from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s [[structural model]]. According to this theory, [[Id, ego, and super-ego|id]] impulses are based on the [[Pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]: instant gratification of one's own desires and needs. Sigmund Freud believed that the id represents biological instinctual impulses in humans, such as aggression ([[Thanatos]] or the Death instinct) and sexuality ([[Eros (love)|Eros]] or the Life instinct).

For example, when the id impulses (e.g., desire to have sexual relations with a stranger) conflict with the [[superego]] (e.g., belief in societal conventions of not having sex with unknown persons), unsatisfied feelings of anxiousness or feelings of anxiety come to the surface. To reduce these unpleasant feelings, the ego might use defence mechanisms (conscious or unconscious blockage of the id impulses).

Freud believed that conflicts between these two structures resulted in conflicts associated with [[psychosexual stages]].

===Definitions of individual psyche structures===
[[File:Structural-Iceberg.svg|thumb|280px|The [[iceberg]] metaphor is often used to explain the psyche's parts in relation to one another.]]
Freud proposed three structures of the psyche or personality:
* '''[[Id, ego, and super-ego#Id|Id]]''': The id is the unconscious reservoir of the libido, the psychic energy that fuels instincts and psychic processes. It is a selfish, childish, pleasure-oriented part of the personality with no ability to delay gratification.
* '''[[Id, ego, and super-ego#Super-ego|Superego]]''':  The superego contains internalised societal and parental standards of "good" and "bad", "right" and "wrong" behaviour.  They include conscious appreciations of rules and regulations as well as those incorporated unconsciously.
* '''[[Id, ego, and super-ego#Ego|Ego]]''': The ego acts as a moderator between the pleasure sought by the id and the morals of the superego, seeking compromises to pacify both. It can be viewed as the individual's "sense of time and place".

===Primary and secondary processes===
In the ego, there are two ongoing processes. First, there is the unconscious primary process, where the thoughts are not organised in a coherent way; the feelings can shift, contradictions are not in conflict or are just not perceived that way, and [[Condensation (psychology)|condensations]] arise. There is no logic and no time line. [[Lust]] is important for this process. By contrast, there is the conscious secondary process, where strong [[Personal boundaries|boundaries]] are set and thoughts must be organised in a coherent way. Most conscious thoughts originate here.

===The reality principle===

Id impulses are not appropriate in a civilised society, so there is societal pressure to modify the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]] in favour of the [[reality principle]]; that is, the requirements of the external world.

===Formation of the superego===

The superego forms as the child grows and learns parental and social standards. The superego consists of two structures: the [[conscience]], which stores information about what is "bad" and what has been punished, and the [[ego ideal]], which stores information about what is "good" and what one "should" do or be.

===The ego's use of defence mechanisms===

When [[anxiety]] becomes overwhelming, it is the ego's place to protect the person by employing defence mechanisms. [[guilt (emotion)|Guilt]], [[embarrassment]], and [[shame]] often accompany anxiety. In the first definitive book on defence mechanisms, ''The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence'' (1936),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1937"&gt;Freud, A. (1937). ''The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defence'', London: Hogarth Press and Institute of Psycho-Analysis. (Revised edition: 1966 (US), 1968 (UK))&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anna Freud]] introduced the concept of signal anxiety; she stated that it was "not directly a conflicted instinctual tension but a signal occurring in the ego of an anticipated instinctual tension".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1937"/&gt;

The signalling function of anxiety is thus seen as crucial, and biologically adapted to warn the organism of danger or a threat to its equilibrium. The anxiety is felt as an increase in bodily or mental tension, and the signal that the organism receives in this way allows for the possibility of taking defensive action regarding the perceived danger. Defence mechanisms work by distorting the id impulses into acceptable forms, or by unconscious or conscious blockage of these impulses.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1937"/&gt;

== Theories and classifications ==

The list of defence mechanisms, with no theoretical consensus on the exact number.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Classifying defence mechanisms according to some of their properties (like underlying mechanisms, similarities or connections with personality) has been attempted. Different theorists have different categorizations and conceptualizations of defence mechanisms. Large reviews of theories of defence mechanisms are available from Paulhus, Fridhandler and Hayes (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Paulhus, D.L., Fridhandler B., and Hayes S. (1997). Psychological defense: Contemporary theory and research. In {{cite book |author1=Briggs, Stephen |author2=Hogan, Robert Goode |author3=Johnson, John W. |title=Handbook of personality psychology |publisher=Academic Press |location=Boston |year=1997 |pages=543–579 |isbn=0-12-134646-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Cramer (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, P. (1991). The Development of Defense Mechanisms: Theory, Research, and Assessment. New York, Springer-Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal of Personality'' published a special issue on defence mechanisms (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jopy.1998.66.issue-6/issuetoc Special issue] [on defense mechanisms], ''Journal of Personality'' (1998), '''66''' (6): 879–1157&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936, [[Anna Freud]] enumerated the ten defence mechanisms that appear in the works of her father, [[Sigmund Freud]]: 1. [[Psychological repression|Repression]], 2. [[Regression (psychology)|Regression]], 3. [[Reaction formation]], 4. [[Isolation (psychology)|Isolation]], 5. [[Undoing (psychology)|Undoing]], 6. [[Psychological projection|Projection]], 7. [[Introjection]], 8. [[self-harm|Turning against one's own person]], 9. Reversal into the opposite, 10. [[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]] or [[Displacement (psychology)|displacement]].&lt;ref name="Szondi1956"&gt;Lipot Szondi (1956) [http://www.szondiforum.org/II.%20Szondi%20Ego%20Defenses%20and%20Sublimination.pdf ''Ego Analysis''] Ch. XIX, translated by Arthur C. Johnston, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Freuds studied defence mechanisms, but Anna spent more of her time and research on five main mechanisms: repression, regression, projection, reaction formation, and sublimation. All defence mechanisms are responses to anxiety and how the consciousness and unconscious handle the stress of a social situation.&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"&gt;Hock, Roger R. "Reading 30: You're Getting Defensive Again!" Forty Studies That Changed Psychology. 7th ed. Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2013. 233–38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Repression''': when a feeling is hidden and forced from the consciousness to the unconscious because it is seen as socially unacceptable.
*'''Regression''': falling back into an early state of mental/physical development seen as "less demanding and safer".&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"/&gt;
*'''Projection''': possessing a feeling that is deigned as socially unacceptable and instead of facing it, that feeling or "unconscious urge" is seen in the actions of other people.&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"/&gt;
*'''Reaction formation''': acting the opposite way that the unconscious instructs a person to behave, "often exaggerated and obsessive". For example, if a wife is infatuated with a man who is not her husband, reaction formation may cause her to – rather than cheat – become obsessed with showing her husband signs of love and affection.&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"/&gt;
*'''Sublimation''': seen as the most acceptable of the mechanisms, an expression of anxiety in socially acceptable ways.&lt;ref name="Hock, Roger R 2013"/&gt;

[[Otto F. Kernberg]] (1967) developed a theory of borderline personality organization of which one consequence may be [[borderline personality disorder]]. His theory is based on ego psychological [[object relations theory]]. Borderline personality organization develops when the child cannot integrate helpful and harmful mental objects together. Kernberg views the use of primitive defence mechanisms as central to this personality organization. Primitive psychological defences are projection, denial, dissociation or splitting and they are called borderline defence mechanisms. Also, devaluation and projective identification are seen as borderline defences.&lt;ref name="pmid4861171"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kernberg O |title=Borderline personality organization |journal=J Am Psychoanal Assoc |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=641–85 |date=July 1967 |pmid=4861171 |doi= 10.1177/000306516701500309|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[George Eman Vaillant]]'s (1977) categorization, defences form a continuum related to their [[Developmental stage theories|psychoanalytical developmental level]].&lt;ref name="Vaillant1997"&gt;{{cite book |author=Vaillant, George E. |title=Adaptation to life |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-316-89520-2 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=June 2013}} They are classified into pathological, immature, neurotic and "mature" defences.

[[Robert Plutchik]]'s (1979) theory views defences as derivatives of basic [[emotions]], which in turn relate to particular diagnostic structures.  According to his theory, reaction formation relates to joy (and manic features), denial relates to acceptance (and histrionic features), repression to fear (and passivity), regression to surprise (and borderline traits), compensation to sadness (and depression), projection to disgust (and paranoia), displacement to anger (and hostility) and intellectualization to anticipation (and obsessionality).&lt;ref&gt;Plutchik, R., Kellerman, H., &amp; Conte, H. R. (1979). A structural theory of ego defences and emotions. In C. E. Izard (Ed.), Emotions in personality and psychopathology (pp. 229–-257). New
York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ([[DSM-IV]])'' published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (1994) includes a tentative diagnostic axis for defence mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (1994). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed.). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; This classification is largely based on Vaillant's hierarchical view of defences, but has some modifications. Examples include: denial, fantasy, rationalization, regression, isolation, projection, and displacement.

== Vaillant's categorization ==
{{Refimprove section |date=June 2013}}
Psychiatrist [[George Eman Vaillant]] introduced a four-level classification of defence mechanisms:&lt;ref name="Cramer"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Protecting the Self|last=Cramer|first=Phebe|publisher=The Guilford Press|year=May 2006|isbn=9781593855284|location=|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FNsmzy-lLagC&amp;pg=PA17 17]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Level I – pathological defences (psychotic denial, delusional projection)
*Level II – immature defences (fantasy, projection, passive aggression, acting out)
*Level III – neurotic defences (intellectualization, reaction formation, dissociation, displacement, repression)
*Level IV – mature defences (humour, sublimation, suppression, altruism, anticipation)

===Level 1: "Psychotic"===
When predominant, the mechanisms on this level are almost always severely [[Psychopathology|pathological]].  These six defences, in conjunction, permit one effectively to rearrange external experiences to eliminate the need to cope with reality.  Pathological users of these mechanisms frequently appear irrational or [[Insanity|insane]] to others. These are the "psychotic" defences, common in overt [[psychosis]].  However, they are normally found in [[dream]]s and throughout childhood as well.&lt;ref name="Vaillant, G. E. 1986"&gt;Vaillant, G. E., Bond, M., &amp; Vaillant, C. O. (1986). An empirically validated hierarchy of defence mechanisms. Archives of General Psychiatry, 73, 786–794. George Eman Valillant&lt;/ref&gt;
They include:
*'''[[Delusion|Delusional projection]]''': Delusions about external reality, usually of a persecutory nature.
*'''[[Denial]]''': Refusal to accept external reality because it is too threatening; arguing against an anxiety-provoking stimulus by stating it doesn't exist; resolution of emotional conflict and reduction of anxiety by refusing to perceive or consciously acknowledge the more unpleasant aspects of external reality.
*'''[[Cognitive distortion|Distortion]]''': A gross reshaping of external reality to meet internal needs.

===Level 2: Immature===
These mechanisms are often present in adults. These mechanisms lessen distress and anxiety produced by threatening people or by an uncomfortable reality.  Excessive use of such defences is seen as socially undesirable, in that they are immature, difficult to deal with and seriously out of touch with reality.  These are the so-called "immature" defences and overuse almost always leads to serious problems in a person's ability to cope effectively.  These defences are often seen in [[major depression]] and [[personality disorders]].&lt;ref name="Vaillant, G. E. 1986"/&gt;
They include:
*'''[[Acting out]]''': Direct expression of an unconscious wish or impulse in action, without conscious awareness of the emotion that drives the expressive behavior.
*'''[[Hypochondriasis]]''': An excessive preoccupation or worry about having a serious illness.
*'''[[Passive-aggressive behavior]]''': Indirect expression of hostility
*'''[[Psychological projection|Projection]]''': A primitive form of [[paranoia]]. Projection reduces anxiety by allowing the expression of the undesirable impulses or desires without becoming consciously aware of them; attributing one's own unacknowledged, unacceptable, or unwanted thoughts and emotions to another; includes severe [[prejudice]] and [[Envy|jealousy]], [[hypervigilance]] to external danger, and "injustice collecting", all with the aim of shifting one's unacceptable thoughts, feelings and impulses onto someone else, such that those same thoughts, feelings, beliefs and motivations are perceived as being possessed by the other.
*'''[[Fantasy (psychology)|Schizoid fantasy]]''': Tendency to retreat into fantasy in order to resolve inner and outer conflicts.

===Level 3: Neurotic===
These mechanisms are considered [[neurosis|neurotic]], but fairly common in adults. Such defences have short-term advantages in coping, but can often cause long-term problems in relationships, work and in enjoying life when used as one's primary style of coping with the world.&lt;ref name="Vaillant, G. E. 1986"/&gt;
They include:
*'''[[Displacement (psychology)|Displacement]]''': defence mechanism that shifts sexual or aggressive impulses to a more acceptable or less threatening target; redirecting emotion to a safer outlet; separation of emotion from its real object and redirection of the intense emotion toward someone or something that is less offensive or threatening in order to avoid dealing directly with what is frightening or threatening.  For example, a parent may yell at their child because they are angry with their spouse.
*'''[[Dissociation (psychology)|Dissociation]]''': Temporary drastic modification of one's personal identity or character to avoid emotional distress; separation or postponement of a feeling that normally would accompany a situation or thought.
*'''[[Intellectualization]]''': A form of isolation; concentrating on the intellectual components of a situation so as to distance oneself from the associated anxiety-provoking emotions; separation of emotion from ideas; thinking about wishes in formal, affectively bland terms and not acting on them; avoiding unacceptable emotions by focusing on the intellectual aspects ([[Solitude|isolation]], [[Rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]], [[ritual]], [[Undoing (psychology)|undoing]], [[Compensation (psychology)|compensation]], and [[magical thinking]]).
*'''[[Reaction formation]]''': Converting unconscious wishes or impulses that are perceived to be dangerous or unacceptable into their opposites; behaviour that is completely the opposite of what one really wants or feels; taking the opposite belief because the true belief causes anxiety.
*'''[[Psychological repression|Repression]]''': The process of attempting to repel desires towards pleasurable instincts, caused by a threat of suffering if the desire is satisfied; the desire is moved to the unconscious in the attempt to prevent it from entering consciousness;&lt;ref name="LaplancheP390"&gt;Laplanche pp. 390, 392{{Full citation needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; seemingly unexplainable naivety, memory lapse or lack of awareness of one's own situation and condition; the emotion is conscious, but the idea behind it is absent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eric.vcu.edu/home/resources/pipc/Other/Personality/Table_Defenses.pdf Psychological Defenses from DSM-IV (see Repression)], Virginia Commonwealth University. Retrieved on December 12, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Level 4: Mature===
These are commonly found among emotionally healthy adults and are considered mature, even though many have their origins in an immature stage of development. They have been adapted through the years in order to optimise success in human society and relationships. The use of these defences enhances pleasure and feelings of control. These defences help to integrate conflicting emotions and thoughts, whilst still remaining effective.  Those who use these mechanisms are usually considered [[virtue|virtuous]].&lt;ref name="Vaillant, G. E. 1986"/&gt;
Mature defences include:
*'''[[Altruism]]''': Constructive service to others that brings pleasure and personal satisfaction.
*'''[[Anticipation (emotion)|Anticipation]]''': Realistic planning for future discomfort.
*'''[[Humour]]''': Overt expression of ideas and feelings (especially those that are unpleasant to focus on or too terrible to talk about directly) that gives pleasure to others. The thoughts retain a portion of their innate distress, but they are "skirted around" by witticism, for example [[self-deprecation]].
*'''[[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]]''': Transformation of unhelpful emotions or instincts into healthy actions, behaviours, or emotions, for example, playing a heavy contact sport such as football or rugby can transform aggression into a game.&lt;ref name="autogenerated483"&gt;Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner (2011), ''Psychology'' (2nd edition), Worth Publishers, p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''[[Thought suppression|Suppression]]''': The conscious decision to delay paying attention to a thought, emotion, or need in order to cope with the present reality; making it possible later to access uncomfortable or distressing emotions whilst accepting them.

Toronto, Ont.: Pearson Education Canada Inc., 2010. 456. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Splitting (psychology)|Splitting]]''':  A primitive defence.  Both harmful and helpful impulses are split off and unintegrated, frequently projected onto someone else.  The defended individual segregates experiences into all-good and all-bad categories, with no room for ambiguity and ambivalence.  When "splitting" is combined with "projecting", the undesirable qualities that one unconsciously perceives oneself as possessing, one consciously attributes to another.&lt;ref name="McWilliams"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychoanalytic Diagnosis: Understanding Personality Structure in the Clinical Process, Second Edition|last=McWilliams|first=Nancy|publisher=The Guilford Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1609184940|location=New York, NY|pages=60,63,103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immature ===
*'''[[Idealization and devaluation|Idealization]]''': Tending to perceive another individual as having more desirable qualities than he or she may actually have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ny6wkHI9qUcC&amp;pg=PA238|title=Ego Mechanisms of Defense: A Guide for Clinicians and Researchers|last=Vaillant|first=George Eman|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|year=1992|isbn=0-88048-404-7|page=238|authorlink=George Eman Vaillant}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Introjection]]''': Identifying with some idea or object so deeply that it becomes a part of that person. For example, introjection occurs when we take on attributes of other people who seem better able to cope with the situation than we do.
*'''[[Passive–aggressive behaviour|Passive aggression]]''': Aggression towards others expressed indirectly or passively, often through [[procrastination]].
*'''[[Projective identification]]''': The object of [[Psychological projection|projection]] invokes in that person a version of the thoughts, feelings or behaviours projected.
*'''[[Somatization]]''': The transformation of uncomfortable feelings towards others into uncomfortable feelings toward oneself: pain, illness, and anxiety.
*'''[[Wishful thinking]]''': Making decisions according to what might be pleasing to imagine instead of by appealing to evidence, rationality, or reality.

=== Neurotic ===
*'''[[Isolation (psychology)|Isolation]]''': Separation of feelings from ideas and events, for example, describing a murder with graphic details with no emotional response.
*'''[[Rationalization (making excuses)]]''': Convincing oneself that no wrong has been done and that all is or was all right through faulty and false reasoning. An indicator of this defence mechanism can be seen socially as the formulation of convenient excuses.
*'''[[Regression (psychology)|Regression]]''': Temporary reversion of the ego to an earlier stage of development rather than handling unacceptable impulses in a more adult way, for example, using whining as a method of communicating despite already having acquired the ability to speak with an appropriate level of maturity.&lt;ref name="autogenerated483" /&gt;  
*'''[[Undoing (psychology)|Undoing]]''':  A person tries to 'undo' an unhealthy, destructive or otherwise threatening thought by acting out the reverse of the unacceptable. Involves symbolically nullifying an unacceptable or guilt provoking thought, idea, or feeling by confession or atonement.
*'''[[Social comparison|Upward and downward social comparisons]]''': A defensive tendency that is used as a means of self-evaluation. Individuals will look to another individual or comparison group who are considered to be worse off in order to dissociate themselves from perceived similarities and to make themselves feel better about themselves or their personal situation.
*'''[[Solitude|Withdrawal]]''':  Withdrawal is a more severe form of defence. It entails removing oneself from events, stimuli, and interactions under the threat of being reminded of painful thoughts and feelings.

=== Mature ===
*'''[[Acceptance]]''': A person's assent to the reality of a situation, recognizing a process or condition (often a difficult or uncomfortable situation) without attempting to change it, protest, or exit. Religions and psychological treatments often suggest the path of acceptance when a situation is both disliked and unchangeable, or when change may be possible only at great cost or risk.
*'''[[Courage]]''': The mental ability and willingness to confront conflicts, fear, pain, danger, uncertainty, despair, obstacles, vicissitudes or intimidation. Physical courage often extends lives, while moral courage preserves the ideals of justice and fairness.
*'''[[Emotion regulation|Emotional self-regulation]]''': The ability to respond to the ongoing demands of experience with the range of emotions in a manner that is socially tolerable. Emotional self-regulation refers to the processes people use to modify the type, intensity, duration, or expression of various emotions.
*'''[[Emotional resilience|Emotional self-sufficiency]]''': Not being dependent on the validation (approval or disapproval) of others.
*'''[[Forgiveness]]''': Cessation of resentment, indignation or anger as a result of a perceived offence, disagreement, or mistake, or ceasing to demand retribution or restitution.
*'''[[Gratitude]]''': A feeling of thankfulness or appreciation involving appreciation of a wide range of people and events. Gratitude is likely to bring higher levels of happiness, and lower levels of depression and stress. Throughout history, gratitude has been given a central position in religious and philosophical theories.
*'''[[Humility]]''': A mechanism by which a person, considering their own defects, has a humble self-opinion. Humility is intelligent self-respect which keeps one from thinking too highly or too meanly of oneself.
*'''[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]]''': The unconscious modelling of one's self upon another person's character and behaviour.
*'''[[Mercy]]''': Compassionate behavior on the part of those in power.
*'''[[Mindfulness (psychology)|Mindfulness]]''': Adopting an orientation (characterized by curiosity, openness, and acceptance) toward one's experiences in the present moment.
*'''[[Moderation]]''': The process of eliminating or lessening extremes and staying within reasonable limits. It necessitates self-restraint which is imposed by oneself on one's own feelings, desires etc.
*'''[[Patience]]''': Enduring difficult circumstances (delay, provocation, criticism, attack etc.) for some time before responding negatively.
*'''[[Respect]]''': Willingness to show consideration or appreciation. Respect can be a specific feeling of regard for the actual qualities of a person or feeling being and also specific actions and conduct representative of that esteem. Relationships and contacts that are built without the presence of respect are seldom long term or sustainable. The lack of respect is at the very heart of most conflict in families, communities, and nations.
*'''[[Toleration|Tolerance]]''': The practice of deliberately allowing or permitting a thing of which one disapproves.

There are many different perspectives on how the construct of ''defence'' relates to the construct of ''[[Coping (psychology)|coping]]''; some writers differentiate the constructs in various ways, but "an important literature exists that does not make any difference between the two concepts".&lt;ref name="pmid19883526"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kramer |first=Ueli |title=Coping and defence mechanisms: What's the difference? - Second act |journal=Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice |volume=83 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=207–221 |date=June 2010 |pmid=19883526 |doi=10.1348/147608309X475989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In at least one of his books, [[George Eman Vaillant]] stated that he "will use the terms ''adaptation'', ''resilience'', ''coping'', and ''defense'' interchangeably".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vaillant |first=George E. |authorlink=George Eman Vaillant |date=2012 |title=Triumphs of experience: the men of the Harvard Grant Study |location=Cambridge, MA |publisher=[[Belknap Press]] of [[Harvard University Press]] |isbn=9780674059825 |oclc=792887462 |doi=10.4159/harvard.9780674067424 |page=[//books.google.com/books?id=pPobx78zuj8C&amp;pg=PA262 262] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Déjà vu'' is most strongly associated with [[temporal lobe epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neurologychannel.com/seizures/types.shtml|title=What Is a Neurological Exam? -  Brain and Nerve Tests - HealthCommunities.com|website=www.neurologychannel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pnoegm2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.howstuffworks.com/question657.htm|title=What is déjà vu?|date=13 June 2001|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kovacs|first1=N.|last2=Auer|first2=T.|last3=Balas|first3=I.|last4=Karadi|first4=K.|last5=Zambo|first5=K.|last6=Schwarcz|first6=A.|display-authors=etal|year=2009|title=Neuroimaging and cognitive changes during déjà vu.|url=|journal=Epilepsy &amp; Behavior|volume=14|issue=|pages=190–196|doi=10.1016/j.yebeh.2008.08.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Medical citation needed|date=March 2018}} This experience  is a [[Neurology|neurological]] anomaly related to epileptic electrical discharge in the brain, creating a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past.

Early researchers{{When|date=March 2018}} tried to establish a link between ''déjà vu'' and mental disorders such as [[anxiety]], [[dissociative identity disorder]] and [[schizophrenia]] but failed to find correlations of any diagnostic value.&lt;ref name="Brown20042"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5flMtjmezeYC&amp;vq=the+deja+vu+experience+alan+brown|title=The Déjà Vu Experience|last=Brown|first=Alan S.|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2004|isbn=1-84169-075-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; No special association has been found between déjà vu and schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Adachi T, Adachi N, Takekawa Y, Akanuma N, Ito M, Matsubara R, Ikeda H, Kimura M, Arai H|date=2006|title=Déjà vu experiences in patients with schizophrenia|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|volume=47|issue=5|pages=389–393|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2005.12.003|issn=0010-440X|pmid=16905402|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Adachi N, Adachi T, Akanuma N, Matsubara R, Ito M, Takekawa Y, Ikeda H, Arai H|date=2007|title=Déjà vu experiences in schizophrenia: relations with psychopathology and antipsychotic medication|journal=Comprehensive Psychiatry|volume=48|issue=6|pages=592–596|doi=10.1016/j.comppsych.2007.05.014|issn=0010-440X|pmid=17954146|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study found that ''déjà vu'' experiences are unlikely to be pathological [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociative experiences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adachi | first1 = N. | last2 = Akanu | first2 = N. | last3 = Adachi | first3 = T. | last4 = Takekawa | first4 = Y. | last5 = Adachi | first5 = Y. | last6 = Ito | first6 = M. | last7 = Ikeda | first7 = H. | year = 2008 | title = Déjà vu experiences are rarely associated with pathological dissociation | url = | journal = Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 196 | issue = | pages = 417–419 | doi=10.1097/nmd.0b013e31816ff36d}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Medical citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Some research has looked into genetics when considering ''déjà vu''. Although there is not currently a gene associated with ''déjà vu'', the LGII gene on [[chromosome 10]] is being studied for a possible link. Certain forms of the gene are associated with a mild form of epilepsy and, though by no means a certainty, ''déjà vu'', along with [[jamais vu]], occurs often enough during seizures (such as [[simple partial seizure]]s) that researchers have reason to suspect a link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brynie|first=Faith|title=Brain Sense: The Science of the Senses and How We Process the World Around Us|year=2009|publisher=Amacom|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmacology==
Certain drugs increase the chances of ''déjà vu'' occurring in the user, resulting in a strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past. Some pharmaceutical drugs, when taken together, have also been implicated in the cause of ''déjà vu''. Taiminen and Jääskeläinen (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

He found the experience so interesting that he completed the full course of his treatment and reported it to the psychologists to write up as a case study. Because of the [[dopaminergic]] action of the drugs and previous findings from electrode stimulation of the brain (e.g. Bancaud, Brunet-Bourgin, Chauvel, &amp; Halgren, 1994),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taiminen and Jääskeläinen speculate that ''déjà vu'' occurs as a result of hyperdopaminergic action in the mesial temporal areas of the brain.

==Explanations==

=== Memory-based explanation ===
Research has associated ''déjà vu'' experiences with good memory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adachi | first1 = N. | last2 = Adachi | first2 = T. | last3 = Kimura | first3 = M. | last4 = Akanuma | first4 = N. | last5 = Takekawa | first5 = Y. | last6 = Kato | first6 = M. | year = 2003 | title = Demographic and psychological features of déjà vu experiences in a nonclinical Japanese population | url = | journal = Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 191 | issue = | pages = 242–247 | doi=10.1097/01.nmd.0000061149.26296.dc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarity between a ''déjà-vu''-eliciting stimulus and an existing, or non-existing but different, memory trace may lead to the sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past.&lt;ref name="Brown20042"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cleary2008"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Cleary AM|year=2008|title=Recognition memory, familiarity and déjà vu experiences |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=17 |issue=5|pages=353–357 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00605.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, encountering something that evokes the implicit associations of an experience or sensation that ''cannot be remembered'' may lead to ''déjà vu''.

In an effort to reproduce the sensation experimentally, Banister and [[Oliver Zangwill|Zangwill]] (1941)&lt;ref name="Banister1941a"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Banister H, Zangwill, O |year=1941 |title=Experimentally induced olfactory paramnesia |journal=[[British Journal of Psychology]]|volume=32|pages=155–175 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1941.tb01018.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banister1941b"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Banister H, Zangwill, O |year=1941 |title=Experimentally induced visual paramnesias |journal=British Journal of Psychology|volume=32|pages=30–51 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1941.tb01008.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; used [[hypnosis]] to give participants posthypnotic amnesia for material they had already seen. When this was later re-encountered, the restricted activation caused thereafter by the posthypnotic amnesia resulted in 3 of the 10 participants reporting what the authors termed "paramnesias".

Memory-based explanations may lead to the development of a number of non-invasive experimental methods by which a long sought-after analogue of ''déjà vu'' can be reliably produced that would allow it to be tested under well-controlled experimental conditions. Cleary suggests that ''déjà vu'' may be a form of familiarity-based recognition (recognition that is based on a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past) and that laboratory methods of probing familiarity-based recognition hold promise for probing ''déjà vu'' in laboratory settings.&lt;ref name="Cleary2008"/&gt;

A 2012 study in the journal ''[[Consciousness and Cognition]]'', that used virtual reality technology to study reported ''déjà vu'' experiences, supported this idea. This virtual reality investigation suggested that similarity between a new scene's spatial layout and the layout of a previously experienced scene in memory (but which fails to be recalled) may contribute to the ''déjà vu'' experience.&lt;ref name="Cleary et al., 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cleary et al., 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cleary |title = Familiarity from the configuration of objects in 3-dimensional space and its relation to déjà vu: A virtual reality investigation | journal = [[Consciousness and Cognition]] | year = 2012 | volume = 21 | pages = 969–975 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1016/j.concog.2011.12.010 | pmid = 22322010 | last2 = Brown | first2 = AS | last3 = Sawyer | first3 = BD | last4 = Nomi | first4 = JS | last5 = Ajoku | first5 = AC | last6 = Ryals | first6 = AJ|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the previously experienced scene fails to come to mind in response to viewing the new scene, that previously experienced scene in memory can still exert an effect—that effect may be a feeling of familiarity with the new scene that is subjectively experienced as a feeling that an event or experience currently being experienced has already been experienced in the past, or of having been there before despite knowing otherwise.

Another possible explanation for the phenomenon of ''déjà vu'' is the occurrence of "[[cryptomnesia]]", which is where information learned is forgotten but nevertheless stored in the brain, and similar occurrences invoke the contained knowledge, leading to a feeling of familiarity because the event or experience being experienced has already been experienced in the past, known as "''déjà vu''". Some experts suggest that memory is a process of reconstruction, rather than a recall of fixed, established events. This reconstruction comes from stored components, involving elaborations, distortions, and omissions. Each successive recall of an event is merely a recall of the last reconstruction. The proposed sense of recognition (''déjà vu'') involves achieving a good "match" between the present experience and our stored data. This reconstruction, however, may now differ so much from the original event that we "know" we have never experienced it before, even though it seems similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngson|first=R.|title=Deja Vu|url=http://www.credoreference.com/entry/rsmhealth/deja_vu|work=The Royal Society of Medicine Health Encyclopedia|publisher=Dr R.M. Youngson|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, Robert Efron of Boston's Veterans Hospital proposed that ''déjà vu'' is caused by dual neurological processing caused by delayed signals. Efron found that the brain's sorting of incoming signals is done in the temporal lobe of the brain's left hemisphere. However, signals enter the temporal lobe ''twice'' before processing, once from each hemisphere of the brain, normally with a slight delay of milliseconds between them. Efron proposed that if the two signals were occasionally not synchronized properly, then they would be processed as two separate experiences, with the second seeming to be a re-living of the first.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Efron R|date=September 1963|title=Temporal perception, aphasia and déjà  vu|journal=Brain: A Journal of Neurology|volume=86|pages=403–424|issn=0006-8950|pmid=14063892|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/deja-vu4.htm|title=How Déjà Vu Works|date=11 April 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dream-based explanation===
One theory of ''déjà vu'' attributes the feeling of having previously seen or experienced something that is currently being seen or experienced to that of having dreamt about a similar situation or place and then forgetting about it until one seems to be mysteriously reminded of the situation or the place while awake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dream Directory: The Comprehensive Guide to Analysis and Interpretation |last=Lohff |first=David C. |year=2004 |publisher=Running Press |isbn=0-7624-1962-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spontaneity of these types of ''déjà vu'' "moments"  can catch many people off-guard, especially when they get the sensation from visiting a specific place they have never been to before, to the point where they are in a temporary state of shock and disbelief.

===''Jamais vu''===
{{Main|Jamais vu }}

''Jamais vu'' (from French, meaning "never seen") is a term in psychology which is used to describe any familiar situation which is not recognized by the observer.

Often described as the opposite of ''déjà vu'', ''jamais vu'' involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. ''Jamais vu'' is more commonly explained as when a person momentarily does not recognize a word, person, or place that they already know. ''Jamais vu'' is sometimes associated with certain types of [[aphasia]], [[amnesia]], and [[epilepsy]].

Theoretically, a ''jamais vu'' feeling in a sufferer of a [[delirium|delirious]] disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in the [[Capgras delusion]], in which the patient takes a known person for a false [[Body double|double]] or impostor.&lt;ref name="moulin"/&gt; If the impostor is himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as [[depersonalisation]], hence ''jamais vus'' of oneself or of the very "reality of reality", are termed depersonalisation (or [[surreality]]) feelings.

The feeling has been evoked through [[semantic satiation]]. [[Chris Moulin]] of the [[University of Leeds]] asked 95 volunteers to write the word "door" 30 times in 60 seconds. 68 percent of the subjects reported symptoms of ''jamais vu'', with some beginning to doubt that "door" was a real word.&lt;ref name="moulin"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,6-2282789,00.html |title=Doctor, I've got this little lump on my arm . . .

===''Presque vu''===
'''''Presque vu''''' ({{IPA-fr|pʁɛsk vy}}, from French, meaning "almost seen") is the intense feeling of being on the very brink of a powerful [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]], insight, or revelation, without actually achieving the revelation. The feeling is often therefore associated with a frustrating, tantalizing sense of incompleteness or near-completeness.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, Jan Dirk (2009).

===''Déjà vous''===
'''''[[Déjà vous (disambiguation)|Déjà vous]]''''' is a pun on the English pronunciation of déjà vu.

Therefor déjà vu is usually pronounced with a {{IPAc-en|uː}} in English. When pronounced this way, {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-deja vu.ogg|ˌ|d|eɪ|ʒ|ɑː|_|ˈ|v|uː}}, it means "already you" in French, rather than "already seen" and is written "déjà vous".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3791">'''EdgeRank''' is the name commonly given to the [[algorithm]] that [[Facebook]] uses to determine what articles should be displayed in a user's [[News Feed (Facebook)|News Feed]]. As of 2011, Facebook has stopped using the EdgeRank system and uses a [[machine learning]] algorithm that, as of 2013, takes more than 100,000 factors into account.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGee|first=Matt|title=EdgeRank Is Dead: Facebook’s News Feed Algorithm Now Has Close To 100K Weight Factors|url=http://marketingland.com/edgerank-is-dead-facebooks-news-feed-algorithm-now-has-close-to-100k-weight-factors-55908|accessdate=28 May 2014|date=Aug 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EdgeRank was developed and implemented by [[Serkan Piantino]].

== Formula and factors ==
In 2010, a simplified version of the EdgeRank algorithm was presented as:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\mathrm{edges\,}e} u_e w_e d_e&lt;/math&gt;
where:
: &lt;math&gt;u_e&lt;/math&gt; is user affinity.
: &lt;math&gt;w_e&lt;/math&gt; is how the content is weighted.
: &lt;math&gt;d_e&lt;/math&gt; is a time-based decay parameter.

* User Affinity: The User Affinity part of the algorithm in Facebook's [http://www.paulramondo.com/facebook-edgerank EdgeRank] looks at the relationship and proximity of the user and the content (post/status update).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Content Weight: What action was taken by the user on the content.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Time-Based Decay Parameter: New or old. Newer posts tend to hold a higher place than older posts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some of the methods that Facebook uses to adjust the parameters are proprietary and not available to the public.&lt;ref name="techcrunch"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/04/22/facebook-edgerank/ |title=EdgeRank: The Secret Sauce That Makes Facebook's News Feed Tick |publisher=techcrunch.com |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2012-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==

EdgeRank and its successors have a broad impact on what users actually see out of what they ostensibly follow: for instance, the selection can produce a [[filter bubble]] (if users are exposed to updates which confirm their opinions etc.) or alter people's mood (if users are shown a disproportionate amount of positive or negative updates).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Dominic|last1=Rushe|title=Facebook sorry – almost – for secret psychological experiment on users|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/oct/02/facebook-sorry-secret-psychological-experiment-users|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2014-10-02|issn=0261-3077|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, for Facebook pages, the typical [[engagement rate]] is less than 1 % (or less than 0.1 % for the bigger ones)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2016-12-17|title=What is a good Facebook engagement rate? See numbers here|url=http://www.michaelleander.me/blog/facebook-engagement-rate-benchmark/|website=www.michaelleander.me}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[organic reach]] 10 % or less for most non-profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2016-12-17|title=The 2016 Social Media Director’s Guide to Benchmarks &amp;#124; M+R|url=http://www.mrss.com/lab/the-2016-social-media-directors-guide-to-benchmarks/|website=www.mrss.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence, for pages it may be nearly impossible to reach any significant audience without paying to promote their content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2016-12-17|title=Facebook Organic Reach Is DEAD (Here's What You Can Do About It)|url=http://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2016/09/facebook-organic-reach-is-dead-heres-what-you-can-do-about-it.html|website=hypebot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2702">'''Elapsed real time''', '''real time''', '''wall-clock time''', or '''wall time''' is the actual time taken from the start of a [[computer program]] to the end. In other words, it is the difference between the time at which a task finishes and the time at which the task started.

Wall time is thus different from [[CPU time]], which measures only the time during which the processor is actively working on a certain task. The difference between the two can arise from [[Computer architecture|architecture]] and [[Runtime system|run-time]] dependent factors, e.g. [[sleep (operating system)|programmed delays]] or waiting for [[system resources]] to become available. Consider the example of a mathematical program that reports that it has used "CPU time 0m0.04s, Wall time 6m6.01s". This means that while the program was active for six minutes and six seconds, during that time the computer's processor spent only 4/100 of a second performing calculations for the program.

Conversely, programs [[Parallel computing|running in parallel]] on more than one processing unit can spend CPU time many times beyond their elapsed time. Since in [[concurrent computing]] the definition of elapsed time is non-trivial, the conceptualization of the elapsed time as measured on a separate, independent wall clock is convenient.

Another definition of "wall time" is the measurement of time via a separate, independent clock as opposed to the local system's internal time, i.e. with regard to the difference between the two.&lt;!-- This is a useless and thus bad definition: If you can state what "opposed" means, then the difference is known, which fundamentally means that the two clocks are synchronized, i.e. the same --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Wall time|url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/W/wall-time.html|work=The Jargon File|accessdate=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Real time" in the meaning of "wall time" should not be confused with [[real-time computing]]. 

== In Simulation ==
The term wall-clock time has also found widespread adoption in computer simulation, to distinguish between, first, the (often compressed or expanded) simulation time and, second, time as it passes for the user of the simulation tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NS-3 Manual|url=http://www.nsnam.org/docs/manual/html/realtime.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OMNeT++ Manual|url=http://www.omnetpp.org/doc/omnetpp/manual/usman.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nicol|first1=John|title=Fundamentals of Real-Time Distributed Simulation|isbn=978-0986841408|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2729">In [[science]], an '''empirical relationship''' or '''phenomenological relationship''' is a relationship or [[correlation]] that is supported by experiment and observation but not necessarily supported by [[theory]].&lt;ref name="Hall"&gt;{{cite|title=Dictionary of Energy|last1=Hall|first1=Carl W.|last2=Hinman|first2=George W.|year=1983|p=84|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|ISBN=0824717937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytical solutions without a theory==
An empirical relationship is supported by confirmatory data irrespective of theoretical basis such as [[First principle#In physics|first principles]]. Sometimes theoretical explanations for what were initially empirical relationships are found, in which case the relationships are no longer considered empirical. An example was the [[Rydberg formula]] to predict the [[wavelength]]s of hydrogen [[spectral line]]s.

The '''evolution of morality''' refers to the emergence of human moral behavior over the course of [[human evolution]]. [[Morality]] can be defined as a system of ideas about right and wrong conduct. In everyday life, morality is typically associated with [[human behavior]],  and not much thought is given to the social conducts of other creatures. The emerging fields of [[evolutionary biology]] and in particular [[sociobiology]] have argued  that, though human [[social behavior]]s are complex, the precursors of human morality can be traced to the behaviors of many other [[social animal]]s. Sociobiological explanations of human behavior are still controversial. The traditional view of social scientists has been that morality is a construct, and is thus culturally relative, although others argue that there is a [[science of morality]].

==Animal sociality==
{{see also|Social animal}}
Though other animals may not possess what humans may perceive as moral behavior, all social animals have had to modify or restrain their behaviors for group living to be worthwhile. Typical examples of behavioral modification can be found in the societies of [[ants]], [[bees]] and [[termites]]. Ant colonies may possess millions of individuals. [[E. O. Wilson]] argues that the single most important factor that leads to the success of ant colonies is the existence of a sterile worker caste. This caste of females are subservient to the needs of their mother, the [[Queen ant|queen]], and in so doing, have given up their own reproduction in order to raise brothers and sisters. The existence of sterile castes among these social insects significantly restricts the competition for mating and in the process fosters cooperation within a colony. Cooperation among ants is vital, because a solitary ant has an improbable chance of long-term survival and reproduction. However, as part of a group, colonies can thrive for decades. As a consequence, ants are one of the most successful families of species on the planet, accounting for a [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] that rivals that of the human species.&lt;ref name="ants"&gt;{{cite book

The basic reason that social animals live in groups is that opportunities for survival and reproduction are much better in groups than living alone. The social behaviors of mammals are more familiar to humans. Highly social mammals such as primates and elephants have been known to exhibit traits that were once thought to be uniquely human, like [[empathy]] and [[altruism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Byrne|first=Richard|author2=Lee, P.C. |author3=Njiraini, N. |author4=Poole, J.H. |author5=Sayialel, K. |author6=Sayialel, S. |author7=Bates, L.A. |author8= Moss, C.J. |title=Do Elephants Show Empathy?|journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies|year=2008|volume=15|series=10-11|pages=204–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Tommy 2011"&gt;Rodriguez, Tommy (2011).

== Primate sociality ==
{{See also|Altruism in animals}}
Humanity’s closest living relatives are [[common chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s. These primates share a [[common ancestor]] with humans who lived four to six million years ago. It is for this reason that chimpanzees and bonobos are viewed as the best available surrogate for this common ancestor. Barbara King argues that while primates may not possess morality in the human sense, they do exhibit some traits that would have been necessary for the evolution of morality. These traits include high intelligence, a capacity for symbolic communication, a sense of [[social norm]]s,  realization of "self", and a concept of continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/14/AR2008081403049.html|title=Barbara J.

King|author=|date=|website=randomhouse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Frans de Waal]] and Barbara King both view human morality as having grown out of primate sociality.
Many social animals such as primates, dolphins, and whales have shown to exhibit what [[Michael Shermer]] refers to as premoral sentiments. According to Shermer, the following characteristics are shared by humans and other social animals, particularly the great apes:

:'' attachment and bonding, cooperation and mutual aid, sympathy and empathy, direct and indirect reciprocity, altruism and reciprocal altruism, conflict resolution and peacemaking, deception and deception detection, community concern and caring about what others think about you, and awareness of and response to the social rules of the group''.&lt;ref name="shermer"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shermer argues that these premoral sentiments evolved in primate societies as a method of restraining individual selfishness and building more cooperative groups. For any social species, the benefits of being part of an altruistic group should outweigh the benefits of individualism. For example, lack of [[group cohesion]] could make individuals more vulnerable to attack from outsiders. Being part of group may also improve the chances of finding food. This is evident among animals that [[pack hunter|hunt in packs]] to take down large or dangerous prey.

All social animals have hierarchical societies in which each member knows its own place.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Social order is maintained by certain rules of expected behavior and dominant group members enforce order through punishment. However, higher order primates also have a sense of reciprocity. Chimpanzees remember who did them favors and who did them wrong.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} For example, chimpanzees are more likely to [[food sharing|share food]] with individuals who have previously [[Personal grooming|groomed]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Chimpanzees Share Forbidden Fruit|first1=Kimberley J.|last1=Hockings|first2=Tatyana|last2=Humle|first3=James R.|last3=Anderson|first4=Dora|last4=Biro|first5=Claudia|last5=Sousa|first6=Gaku|last6=Ohashi|first7=Tetsuro|last7=Matsuzawa|date=12 September 2007|publisher=|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=2|issue=9 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0000886|pmid=17849015 | pmc=1964537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vampire bats also demonstrate a sense of reciprocity and altruism. They share blood by regurgitation, but do not share randomly. They are most likely to share with other bats who have shared with them in the past or who are in dire need of feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.life.umd.edu/faculty/wilkinson/Wilkinson84.pdf|title=Reciprocal food sharing in the vampire bat|author=|date=|website=umd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals such as Capuchin monkeys&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.primates.com/monkeys/fairness.html|title=Monkey research : monkeys show sense of justice |website=www.primates.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dogs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2008/12/08/0810957105|title=The absence of reward induces inequity aversion in dogs|first1=Friederike|last1=Range|first2=Lisa|last2=Horn|first3=Zsófia|last3=Viranyi|first4=Ludwig|last4=Huber|date=7 December 2008|publisher=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|pages=pnas.0810957105|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.0810957105|pmid=19064923|pmc=2629244}}&lt;/ref&gt; also display an understanding of fairness, refusing to co-operate when presented unequal rewards for the same behaviors.

Chimpanzees live in [[fission-fusion society|fission-fusion groups]] that average 50 individuals. It is likely that early ancestors of humans lived in groups of similar size. Based on the size of [[wikt:extant|extant]] hunter gatherer societies, recent paleolithic hominids lived in bands of a few hundred individuals.  As community size increased over the course of human evolution, greater enforcement to achieve group cohesion would have been required. Morality may have evolved in these bands of 100 to 200 people as a means of [[social control]], [[conflict resolution]] and group solidarity. This numerical limit is theorized to be hard coded in our [[gene]]s since even modern humans have difficulty maintaining stable social relationships with [[Dunbar's number|more than 100–200 people]].  According to Dr. de Waal, human morality has two extra levels of sophistication that are not found in primate societies. Humans enforce their society's moral codes much more rigorously with rewards, punishments and reputation building. People also apply a degree of judgment and reason not seen in the animal kingdom.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==The punishment problems==
While groups may benefit from avoiding certain behaviors, those harmful behaviors have the same effect regardless of whether the offending individuals are aware of them or not.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Nietzsche Beyond Good and Evil: Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future 1886&lt;/ref&gt; Since the individuals themselves can increase their reproductive success by doing many of them, any characteristics that entail impunity are positively selected by evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1979). Twelve misunderstandings of kin selection&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically punishing individuals aware of their breach of rules would select against the ability to be aware of it, precluding any coevolution of both conscious choice and a sense of it being the basis for moral and penal liability in the same species.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Elizabeth, et al. (1975). "Against 'Sociobiology'". [letter] New York Review of Books 22 (Nov. 13).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human social intelligence==
The [[Dunbar's number|social brain hypothesis]], detailed by [[Robin Dunbar|R.I.M Dunbar]] in the article ''The Social Brain Hypothesis and Its Implications for Social Evolution'', supports the fact that the brain originally evolved to process factual information. The brain allows an individual to recognize patterns, perceive speech, develop strategies to circumvent ecologically-based problems such as foraging for food, and also permits the phenomenon of [[color vision]]. Furthermore, having a large brain is a reflection of the large cognitive demands of complex social systems. It is said that in humans and primates the neocortex is responsible for reasoning and consciousness. Therefore, in social animals, the neocortex came under intense selection to increase in size to improve social cognitive abilities. Social animals, such as humans are capable of two important concepts, coalition formation, or group living, and tactical deception, which is a tactic of presenting false information to others. The fundamental importance of animal social skills lies within the ability to manage relationships and in turn, the ability to not just commit information to memory, but manipulate it as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar, R. 2009. The Social Brain Hypothesis and Its Implications for Social Evolution. Annals of Human Biology 562-572.&lt;/ref&gt; An adaptive response to the challenges of social interaction and living is [[theory of mind]]. Theory of mind as defined by [[Martin Brüne|M. Brune]], is the ability to infer another individual's mental states or emotions.&lt;ref name="Brune, M. 2006"&gt;Brune, M., and Brunecohrs, U. 2006. Theory Of Mind—Evolution, Ontogeny, Brain Mechanisms And Psychopathology. Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews, 30:437-455.&lt;/ref&gt; Having a strong theory of mind is tied closely with possessing advanced [[social intelligence]]. Collectively, group living requires cooperation and generates conflict. Social living puts strong evolutionary selection pressures on acquiring social intelligence due to the fact that living in groups has advantages. Advantages to group living include protection from predators and the fact that groups in general outperform the sum of an individual’s performance. But, from an objective point of view, group living also has disadvantages, such as, competition from within the group for resources and mates. This sets the stage for something of an evolutionary arms race from within the species.

Within populations of social animals, altruism, or acts of behavior that are disadvantageous to one individual while benefiting other group members has evolved. This notion seems to be contradictory to evolutionary thought, due to the fact that an organism's fitness and success is defined by its ability to pass genes on to the next generation. According to [[Ernst Fehr|E. Fehr]], in the article, ''The Nature of Human Altruism'', the evolution of altruism can be accounted for when [[kin selection]] and [[inclusive fitness]] are taken into account; meaning [[reproductive success]] is not just dependent on the number of offspring an individual produces, but also the number of offspring that related individuals produce.&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, E., &amp; Fischbacher, U. 2003.  The Nature Of Human Altruism. Nature 425:785-791.&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of familial relationships altruism is also seen, but in a different manner typically defined by the [[prisoner's dilemma]], theorized by [[John Forbes Nash, Jr.|John Nash]]. The prisoner's dilemma serves to define cooperation and defecting with and against individuals driven by incentive, or in Nash's proposed case, years in jail. In evolutionary terms, the best strategy to use for the prisoner's dilemma is tit-for-tat. In the tit-for-tat strategy, an individual should cooperate as long others are cooperating, and not defect until another individual defects against them. At their core, complex social interactions are driven by the need to distinguish sincere cooperation and defection.

Brune details that theory of mind has been traced back to primates, but it is not observed to the extent that it is in the modern human. The emergence of this unique trait is perhaps where the divergence of the modern human begins, along with our acquisition of language. Humans use metaphors and imply much of what we say. Phrases such as, "You know what I mean?" are not uncommon and are direct results of the sophistication of the human theory of mind. Failure to understand another's intentions and emotions can yield inappropriate social responses and are often associated with human mental conditions such as [[autism]], [[schizophrenia]], [[bipolar disorder]], some forms of [[dementia]], and [[psychopathy]]. This is especially true for autism spectrum disorders, where social disconnect is evident, but non-social intelligence can be preserved or even in some cases augmented, such as in the case of a savant.&lt;ref name="Brune, M. 2006"/&gt; The need for social intelligence surrounding theory of mind is a possible answer to the question as to why morality has evolved as a part of human behavior.

==Evolution of religion==
{{see also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}
Psychologist Matt J. Rossano muses that religion emerged after morality and built upon morality by expanding the social scrutiny of individual behavior to include supernatural agents. By including ever watchful ancestors, spirits and gods in the social realm, humans discovered an effective strategy for restraining selfishness and building more cooperative groups.&lt;ref name="supernature"&gt;

==The Wason selection task==
{{See also|Wason selection task|Altruism#Scientific viewpoints|}}
In an experiment where subjects must demonstrate abstract, complex reasoning, researchers have found that humans (as has been seen in other animals) have a strong innate ability to reason about social exchanges. This ability is believed to be intuitive, since the logical rules do not seem to be accessible to the individuals for use in situations without moral overtones.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/print/1870/the-science-good-and-evil?page=0,0&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emotion ==
[[Disgust]], one of the [[basic emotions]], may have an important role in certain forms of morality. Disgust is argued to be a specific response to certain things or behaviors that are dangerous or undesirable from an evolutionary perspective. One example is things that increase the risk of an [[infectious disease]] such as spoiled foods, dead bodies, other forms of microbiological [[decomposition]], a physical appearance suggesting sickness or poor [[hygiene]], and various body fluids such as [[feces]], [[vomiting|vomit]], [[phlegm]], and [[blood]]. Another example is disgust against evolutionary disadvantageous mating such as [[incest]] (the [[incest taboo]]) or unwanted sexual advances.&lt;ref name="Rodriguez, Tommy 2011"/&gt; Still another example are behaviors that may threaten group cohesion or cooperation such as cheating, lying, and stealing. [[MRI]] studies have found that such situations activate areas in the brain associated with disgust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Tybur | first1 = J.

The '''fact–value distinction''' is the distinction between things that can be known to be true and things that are the personal preferences of individuals.

==David Hume's skepticism==
The fact–value distinction emerged in [[philosophy]] in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In particular, [[David Hume]] (1711–1776) argued that human beings are unable to ground normative arguments in positive arguments, that is, to derive [[is–ought problem|''ought'' from ''is'']]. Hume was a [[skeptic]], and although a complex and dedicated philosopher, he shared a political viewpoint with early Enlightenment [[philosophers]] such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) and [[John Locke]] (1632–1704). Specifically, Hume, at least to some extent, argued that religious and national hostilities that divided European society were based on unfounded beliefs. In effect, Hume contended that such hostilities are not found in [[nature]], but are a human creation, depending on a particular time and place, and thus unworthy of mortal conflict.

==Naturalistic fallacy==
The fact–value distinction is closely related to the [[naturalistic fallacy]], a topic debated in ethical and [[moral philosophy]]. [[G. E. Moore]] believed it essential to all ethical thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Casimir Lewy 1965 - G.E. Moore on the naturalistic fallacy&lt;/ref&gt; However, contemporary philosophers like [[Phillipa Foot]] have called into question the validity of such assumptions. Others, such as Ruth Anna Putnam, argue that even the most "scientific" of disciplines are affected by the "values" of those who research and practice the vocation.&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Ruth Anna. "Perceiving Facts and Values", ''[[Philosophy (journal)|Philosophy]]'' 73, 1998. {{JSTOR|3752124}}  This article as well as her earlier article, "Creating Facts and Values", ''Philosophy'' 60, 1985 {{JSTOR|3750998}}, examines how scientists may base their choice of investigations on their unexamined subjectivity, which undermines the objectivity of their hypothesis and findings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.C. "Ruth Anna Putnam and the Fact-Value Distinction", ''Philosophy'' 74, 1999.  {{JSTOR|3751844}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the difference between the naturalistic fallacy and the fact–value distinction is derived from the manner in which modern [[social science]] has used the fact–value distinction, and not the strict naturalistic fallacy to articulate new fields of study and create academic disciplines.

==Moralistic fallacy==
The fact–value distinction is also closely related to the [[moralistic fallacy]], an invalid inference of factual conclusions from purely evaluative premises. For example, an invalid inference "Because everybody ought to be equal, there are no innate genetic differences between people" is an instance of the moralistic fallacy. As for the naturalistic fallacy one attempts to move from an "is" to an "ought" statement, with the moralistic fallacy one attempts to move from an "ought" to an "is" statement.

==Nietzsche's table of values==
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' said that a table of values hangs above every great people. Nietzsche points out that what is common among different peoples is the act of ''esteeming'', of creating values, even if the values are different from one people to the next. Nietzsche asserts that what made people great was not the content of their beliefs, but the act of valuing. Thus the values a community strives to articulate are not as important as the collective will to act on those values.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''. Book Two "On the Virtuous": "You who are virtuous still want to be paid! Do you want rewards for virtue, and heaven for earth, and the eternal for your today? And now you are angry with me because I teach that there is no reward and paymaster? And verily, I do not even teach that virtue is its own reward."&lt;/ref&gt; The ''willing'' is more essential than the intrinsic worth of the goal itself, according to Nietzsche.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich. ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''. Book Four "On Old and New Tablets": "To redeem what is past in man and to recreate all 'it was' until the will says, 'Thus I willed it! Thus I shall will it!' - this I called redemption and this alone I taught them to call redemption."&lt;/ref&gt; "A thousand goals have there been so far," says Zarathustra, "for there are a thousand peoples. Only the yoke for the thousand necks is still lacking: the one goal is lacking. Humanity still has no goal." Hence, the title of the aphorism, "On The Thousand And One Goals." The idea that one value-system is no more worthy than the next, although it may not be directly ascribed to Nietzsche, has become a common premise in modern social science. [[Max Weber]] and [[Martin Heidegger]] absorbed it and made it their own. It shaped their philosophical endeavor, as well as their political understanding.

==Criticisms==
Virtually all modern philosophers affirm ''some'' sort of fact–value distinction, insofar as they distinguish between science and "valued" disciplines such as [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]], or the fine [[arts]]. However, philosophers such as [[Hilary Putnam]] argue that the distinction between fact and value is not as absolute as Hume envisioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reasonpapers.com/pdf/28/rp_28_9.pdf |title=The Collapse of the Fact/Value Dichotomy and Other Essays, Cambridge, MA : Harvard University Press, 2002 |author=Putnam, Hilary |publisher=Reasonpapers.com |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophical [[pragmatists]], for instance, believe that true propositions are those that are ''useful'' or ''effective'' in predicting future (empirical) states of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/#PeiTruRea |title=Pragmatism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date=2008-08-16 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Far from being value-free, the pragmatists' conception of truth or facts directly relates to an end (namely, empirical predictability) that human beings regard as ''normatively'' desirable. Other thinkers reject an absolutist fact–value distinction by contending that our senses are imbued with prior conceptualizations, making it impossible to have any observation that is totally value-free, which is how Hume and the later [[Positivism|positivists]] conceived of facts.

=== Functionalist counterexamples ===
Several counterexamples have been offered by philosophers claiming to show that there are cases when an evaluative statement does indeed logically follow from a factual statement. [[Arthur Prior|A. N. Prior]] points out, from the statement "He is a sea captain," it logically follows, "He ought to do what a sea captain ought to do."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alasdair MacIntyre]], ''After Virtue'' (1984), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] points out, from the statement "This watch is grossly inaccurate and irregular in time-keeping and too heavy to carry about comfortably," the evaluative conclusion validly follows, "This is a bad watch."&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.'', p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Searle]] points out, from the statement "Jones promised to pay Smith five dollars," it logically follows that "Jones ought to pay Smith five dollars." The act of promising by definition places the promiser under obligation.&lt;ref&gt;Don MacNiven, ''Creative Morality'', pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral realism ===
[[Philippa Foot]] adopts a [[Moral realism|moral realist]] position, criticizing the idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a "committal in a new dimension".&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Foot, “Moral Beliefs,” ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'', vol. 59 (1958), pp. 83–104.&lt;/ref&gt;  She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word "injury". Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, haven’t we fallen into the old naturalist fallacy?
{{quote|It may seem that the only way to make a necessary connexion between 'injury' and the things that are to be avoided, is to say that it is only used in an 'action-guiding sense' when applied to something the speaker intends to avoid. But we should look carefully at the crucial move in that argument, and query the suggestion that someone might happen not to want anything for which he would need the use of hands or eyes. Hands and eyes, like ears and legs, play a part in so many operations that a man could only be said not to need them if he had no wants at all.&lt;ref&gt;Foot 1958, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Foot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.
{{quote|Philosophers who have supposed that actual action was required if 'good' were to be used in a sincere evaluation have got into difficulties over weakness of will, and they should surely agree that enough has been done if we can show that any man has reason to aim at virtue and avoid vice. But is this impossibly difficult if we consider the kinds of things that count as virtue and vice? Consider, for instance, the cardinal virtues, prudence, temperance, courage and justice. Obviously any man needs prudence, but does he not also need to resist the temptation of pleasure when there is harm involved? And how could it be argued that he would never need to face what was fearful for the sake of some good? It is not obvious what someone would mean if he said that temperance or courage were not good qualities, and this not because of the 'praising' sense of these words, but because of the things that courage and temperance are.&lt;ref&gt;Foot 1958, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Bandeiras06052007.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Brazilian flag]] being changed in a monthly ceremony that takes place in the [[Praça dos Três Poderes]], [[Brasília]].]]

A '''flag protocol''' defines the proper placement, handling, use, and disposal of [[flag]]s. Some countries have added certain protocols into their legal system while others prefer to have "guidelines" without civil or criminal consequences attached.
{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==General guidelines==
General guidelines are accepted practically universally.

===On a mast or pole===
The flag of honor, which is the [[National flag|nation's flag]] in most cases, is flown on the center mast if possible. It is also correct to fly the flag on its own right. To an observer it would be on the far left. If more than three flags are used, the proper position is as far left from the point of view of an observer. An additional flag may be placed on the right side, but is not necessary.

When two poles are crossed, the position of honor is the flag that ends on the left side from the point of view of an observer (the pole will therefore end on the right).

In a semicircle, the position of honor is the center. If a full circle is used outside an entrance to an arena or stadium, the position of honor is directly over the entrance. If used to line the walls of the arena, the flag should be placed directly opposite the entrance.

===Hanging===
When flown horizontally, as from a flag pole, the flag should be oriented so that the [[Flag terminology|canton]] is closest to the top of the pole. If hung against a wall, the canton should be placed in the upper-left corner from the point of view of the observer.

When hung vertically, flags should be rotated so the canton is again closest to the top of the pole. If the flag is displayed against a wall, the canton should again appear in the upper-left corner, which requires that the flag be both rotated and "flipped" from its horizontal orientation.

===Other places===
On a vehicle the flag should be put on a window or affixed securely to the front of the chassis, on the nearside of the vehicle, i.e. the one opposite the driver. (In other words, in countries that drive on the right hand side of the road, a flag is on the right of the vehicle.) On a vehicle where a visiting Head of State or Government is sharing a car with the host Head of State or Government, the host's flag takes the nearside position, the guest's flag on the offside.

When placed with a podium or at a place of worship, the flag should hang directly behind or on a pole to the right of the speaker, from the point of view of the flag.

When carried in single file, the flag of honor leads.

===Multiple flags===
When flags of many nations are flown the flag of the hosting country should be placed on the right with the rest following in alphabetical order in the language of the host country. The flag of any sovereign nation should not be displayed over that of another, except when the nations are at war with each other.&lt;ref&gt;4 U.S. Code § 7(g)&lt;/ref&gt;

===On a helicopter===
Sometimes in a ceremonial [[flypast]], a flag is flown from a weighted rope dangling from beneath a helicopter.

==By country==
===Brunei===
Members of the royal family and the nobility each have [[Flag of Brunei#Personal standards|their own flags]]. The Standard of the [[Sultan of Brunei|Sultan]] must be flown only over [[Istana Nurul Iman]]. The same goes for the Crown Prince (Deputy Sultan)'s flag, but other non-royal title holders fly the [[Flag of Brunei|national flag]]. As in many other countries, Bruneians consider it taboo for the flag to touch the ground.

===France===
When a French vessel meets another French ship, it is to [[flag dipping|lower and raise]] its ensign as a greeting. A merchant ship meeting a ship of the [[French Navy]] will greet three times.

===India===
{{Main|Flag of India#Protocol}}
The flag of India has a very distinctive protocol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/nationalflag2002.htm |title=Flag Code of India |accessdate=October 11, 2006 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224162430/http://mha.nic.in/nationalflag2002.htm |archivedate=February 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is governed by the Flag Code of India, 2002 the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950; and the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr2002/fapr2002/f030420021.html|title=Flag code of India, 2002|accessdate=11 October 2006|date=4 April 2002|work=Fact Sheet|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insults to the national flag, are punishable by law with imprisonment up to three years, or a fine, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mha.nic.in/pdfs/Prevention_Insults_National_Honour_Act1971.pdf|title=The Prevention Of Insults To National Honour Act, 1971|publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India|accessdate=11 December 2009|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official regulation states that the flag must never touch the ground or water, or be used as a drapery in any form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/feature/feyr2002/fapr2002/f030420021.html|title=Flag code of India, 2002|accessdate=11 October 2006|date=4 April 2002|work=Fact Sheet|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disposal of damaged flags is also covered by the flag code. Damaged or soiled flags may not be cast aside or disrespectfully destroyed; they have to be destroyed as a whole in private, preferably by burning or by any other method consistent with the dignity of the flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mha.nic.in/nationalflag2002.htm |title=Flag Code of India|accessdate=11 October 2006|date=25 January 2006|publisher=Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060110155908/http://mha.nic.in/nationalflag2002.htm |archivedate = 10 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===
Because the [[flag of Saudi Arabia]] bears the [[Shahada]], it is never flown at half-mast.

===United Kingdom===
The [[Department for Communities and Local Government]] in November 2012 released the ''Plain English guide to flying flags'' for England, a "summary of the new, more liberalised, controls over flag flying that were introduced on 12 October 2012".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/15438/flying_flags_guide.pdf gov.uk: "Plain English guide to flying flags" Nov 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; In England, the statute governing the flying of flags are The Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2007&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/783/contents/made&lt;/ref&gt; and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2012/2372/contents/made&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|United States Flag Code}}
When displayed either horizontally or vertically against a wall, the union should be uppermost and to the flag's own right, that is, to the observer's left. When displayed in a window, the flag should be displayed in the same way, with the union or blue field to the left of the observer in the street.

The flag should be to the speaker's right (also described as the flag's own right or audience's left), that is to the left of the podium or pulpit as the speaker is facing the audience. Old guidelines had a distinction whether the flag was at the level of the speaker on a stage or the level of the audience. That distinction has been eliminated and the rule simplified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/betsy/flagetiq.html|title=Flag Rules and Regulations|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}--&gt;

When the flag is displayed at half-staff, it is customary to raise it briskly to the top the flag pole, then lower it slowly to the half-way mark. This is also done when lowering the flag. The flag is only displayed at half-staff by presidential decree or act of Congress, except on two days: On [[Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day]], the flag can be displayed at half-staff until sundown.; on [[Memorial Day]], the flag is flown at half-staff until noon, and then raised to full staff for the remainder of the day.

When displaying the US flag, it is customary for it to be above a state's flag when flown on the same pole. When flown separately, a state's flag may be at the same height as the US flag, with the US flag to the left of the state flag, from the perspective of the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usflag.org/flagetiquette.html|title=USFlag.org: A website dedicated to the Flag of the United States of America - Flag Etiquette|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/betsy/flagetiq.html|title=Flag Rules and Regulations|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When flown with several state flags, the US flag should be at the same height and to the flag's own right (viewer's left), or at the center of and higher than a grouping of state flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushistory.org/betsy/flagetiq.html|title=Flag Rules and Regulations|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--although there is debate as to whether or not this applies to--&gt; The idea that only the Texas and Hawaii flags—having been the national flags of the Republic of Texas and the Kingdom of Hawaii—may be flown at an equal height to the US flag is a legend.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} In fact, ''any'' other flag may be flown at an equal height to the US flag provided the US flag is at the leftmost staff from the perspective of the viewer.

The flag of the United States is used to drape the coffins of deceased [[veteran]]s of the [[United States Armed Forces|armed forces]]. When it is so used, the Union (white stars on blue background) is placed above the deceased's left shoulder.

According to United States Code found in Title 4, Chapter 1 pertaining to patriotic customs and observances:
{{quote|§8(k) The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed, preferably by burning.}}

These laws were supplemented by executive orders and presidential proclamations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/cic_text/misc/ourflag/flaglaws3.htm|title=Federal Citizen Information Center: Our Flag|accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uruguay===
National flags cannot be adulterated on any way, nor be used with other intention than as national symbols as stated by law. It is also prohibited for buildings to raise flags other than national flags. The public loyalty oath to the flag must be taken once by every citizen and is celebrated on 19 June at learning institutes. Disposal of damaged flags is done by the Uruguayan Army. Each year on 24 September damaged flags are burnt as an official act.

In [[topology]], a '''formal ball''' is an extension of the notion of [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] to allow unbounded and negative radius.  The concept of formal ball was introduced by Weihrauch and Schreiber in 1981 and the negative radius case (the '''generalized formal ball''') by Tsuiki and Hattori in 2008.

Specifically, if &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric space]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; the nonnegative real numbers, then an element of &lt;math&gt;B^+(X,d)=X\times\mathbb{R}^{+}&lt;/math&gt; is a formal ball.  Elements of &lt;math&gt;B(X,d)=X\times\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are known as generalized formal balls.

Formal balls possess a partial order &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;(x,r)\leq(y,s)&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)\leq r-s&lt;/math&gt;, identical to that defined by set inclusion.

Generalized formal balls are interesting because this partial order works just as well for &lt;math&gt;B(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; as for &lt;math&gt;B^+(X,d)&lt;/math&gt;, even though a generalized formal ball with negative radius does not correspond to a subset of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

Formal balls possess the [[Lawson topology]] and the [[Martin topology]].

The '''graph of desire''' ({{lang-fr|graphe du désir}}) is a conceptual tool from the [[psychoanalytic]] theory of [[Jacques Lacan]].

==History==
Lacan devised numerous quasi-mathematical diagrams to represent the structure of the unconscious and its points of contact with empirical and mental reality. He adapted figures from the field of [[topology]] in order to represent the Freudian view of the mind as embodying a 'double inscription' (which could be defined as the ultimate inseparability of unconscious motivations from conscious ones).

==Graph==
The graph of desire was first proposed in a 1960 colloquium, and was later published in the ''Ecrits''. It depends on ideas developed originally in Lacan's ''Schema R'', a graph in which fundamental organising structures of the human mind are shown in a schematic relationship to the domains or 'orders' which in turn structure human reality: the Imaginary, the Symbolic and the Real.

The graph of desire is a 'flattened' representation of a '''signifying chain''' as it crosses a pathway Lacan called a [[vector (geometric)|vector]] of desire. It appears as two curved lines which cross one another at two separate points. Each line has a symbolic meaning.

===Elements of the graph===
The signifying chain begins in a linguistic sign (S) and progresses to a signification (S'), or a [[linguistic meaning]]. It can be expressed sententially and has a duration.

The vector of desire is a representation of the volition and will of the split or barred subject (''$''). Unlike the signifying chain, the vector of desire is expressed metaphorically, and has no duration.

It is necessary to bear in mind the special conception of the subject Lacan means by the (''$'') symbol. The barred subject is the internally conflicted result of the processes of individuation that begin in infancy. In Lacan's account of individuation, the infant must respond to the loss of symbiosis with the mother by creating a symbol of this lack. In doing so the infant is constrained by the always-already present structures of a natural language. There is a certain relief in the summoning of a symbolically present 'mother', but the experience of the mother who returns to the infant as someone-signified-by-the-word-'mother' is nevertheless one of absolute, irremediable loss. Mother — and the world — is now mediated by the Symbolic order and the exigencies of language.

With this in mind, the crossing of the two pathways in the graph of desire can be understood to connote interference and constraint. Desire for the primordial object is not fulfilled except through the constraints of the signifying chain. The vector of desire is metaphorical, substituting various objects for the absolutely lost primordial one, and irrupting into language without regard for the passage of time, or for the particular human relationship through which the vector moves.

Finally, the points at which the vector of desire and the signifying chain cross can be seen as instances of Freudian double inscription. The 'conscious and unconscious' significance of an act or utterance are one and the same, and each constrains the other.

As part of this discipline, several commonly found patterns of system behavior were found, named and described in detail. The Growth and Underinvestment Archetype is one of such patterns.

[[File:Growth and underinvestment.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Growth and underinvestment"''']]

== Elements of Archetype ==

The system described in the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype consists of three feedback loops. Each feedback loop can be one of two types:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Senge|first1=Peter M.|title=The fifth discipline the art and practice of the learning organization|date=2006|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-47764-4|pages=82–83|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Reinforcing loop''' – A reinforcing loop is a type of a feedback loop, where a positive increase of variable A causes an '''increase''' in variable B, which then in turn causes a positive increase in variable A. The behavior of such system in time is an exponential increase in both variables A and B. As an example, consider the behavior of a long-term bank savings account. As your savings accumulate, the more interest per time period you receive, further increasing the balance on your savings account. This is the crowning principle of retirement planning schemes, such as the American [[401k]] pension system. In many cases however, there is a balancing loop to prevent the reinforcing behavior from occurring indefinitely.
* '''Balancing loop''' – A balancing loop is a type of a feedback loop, where a positive increase of variable A causes a '''decrease''' in variable B, which in turn causes a positive increase in variable A. The behavior of such a system leads to the system finding stable state over time. Consider the behavior of a thermostat. The thermostat is a very simple device in its core. If the measured temperature exceeds a certain preconfigured value, the heating is turned off. Otherwise the heating is turned on. The heating in turn influences the temperature, forcing the thermostat to reevaluate its behavior periodically. Since there is a delay in the system (it takes a while for the room to heat up after the heating has been turned on), the temperature in the room will oscillate around the preconfigured value. This happens because when the heating is turned on, it doesn’t have an immediate effect (the body emitting heat must warm up first), causing the temperature to fall below desired level. The same effect is in play when the temperature exceeds the desired value and the heating is turned off, since it takes a while for the heating body to cool down, causing further undesired temperature increases. This behavior could be potentially mitigated by setting two separate temperature thresholds, a lower one as a signal for the heating to activate and a higher one as a signal for the heating to deactivate.

=== Reinforcing loop ===

The reinforcing loop consists of a growing action, such as units of a specific product shipped to a customer, and a current state, such as current demand for a specific product. The growing action causes a positive increase in the current state. The increase of the current state then in turn causes a positive increase of the growing action, thereby creating the reinforcing characteristic of the loop.

As discussed above, this reinforcing loop would have exponential behavior in time, if its growth wouldn’t be bound by the combination of the two balancing loops present in the system.

=== First balancing loop ===

The first balancing loop is directly connected to the reinforcing loop via the current state variable. The first balancing loop consists of a current state and a slowing action (for example exceeding capacity limits). The growth of the current state causes the growth of the slowing action. The growth of the slowing action in turn reduces the current state, thereby creating a balancing loop.

One example of this balancing loop is a situation where a number of units manufactured is increasing (current state), which causes the manufacturing utilization to increase (end eventually exceed capacity). This will make each additional unit of manufacturing more expensive, reducing the growth in units manufacture. One can note that a rubber-banding effect occurs, since the more units are manufactured, the more expensive the manufacturing is. This loop taken in isolation would eventually find a stable state, independently of its beginning state.

=== Second balancing loop ===

The second balancing loop is what differentiates the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype from other archetypes. It is directly connected to the first balancing loop via the slowing action variable. The balancing loop consists of several elements:

* A slowing action
* A performance standard – represents a pressure on upholding a certain standard of the system's output (e.g. the manufactured product)
* A perceived need for investment – the first step toward an actual investment
* An investment
* A delay in investment – represents the time needed for the system to go from a perception of an investment need to actually making the investment. In the real world this element is often caused by hesitation of management to invest in additional capacity.

First, the growth of the slowing action causes growth of the perceived need for investment (e.g. building additional manufacturing capacity). Another factor that can positively contribute to the perceived need to invest is the failure to uphold the performance standard (for example manufacturing error rate). The perceived need to invest positively translates into actually making the investment. The investment made then negatively influences the slowing action (e.g. removal of capacity limits).

The last element of the second balancing loop is the delay in investment, which happens for a variety of reasons, for example hesitation of management to invest in additional capacity.

=== Behavior of Archetype ===
The key to understanding the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype is in the delay in investment. This delay causes the second balancing loop to have longer cycle times than the first balancing loop. That in turn has the following effect:

Since the second balancing loop has a shorter loop cycle, it causes the current state to be reduced, which in turn decreases the slowing action. This happens before an investment is made, in effect reducing the perceived need for investment.

In effect, the first and second reinforcing loop act together as a reinforcing loop to restrict growth.

If it were not for the delay, the whole system would work optimally thanks to timely investments.

==== Difficulties Identifying Archetype ====
At least two factors can contribute to the difficulty of identifying the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype in real-world complex systems.

First, the archetype can be temporarily covered up by [http://www.systems-thinking.org/theWay/ssb/sb.htm shifting the burden], that is, by trying to solve the underlying problem by a symptomatic solution, instead of a fundamental one. This leads to further delaying the investment decision, narrowing the window for effective and timely investment or missing it entirely.

Second, in order to recognize the archetype, a holistic view of the system is required. This can be difficult, since the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype can create many issues that management must attend to,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Senge|first1=Peter M.|title=The fifth discipline the art and practice of the learning organization|date=2006|publisher=Broadway Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-307-47764-4|page=117|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in effect preventing them from stepping back and seeing the bigger picture.

=== Optimizing the System ===
When discussing how to optimize the system, it can be beneficial to discuss what a leverage point is.

The leverage point in the system is a place where structural changes can lead to significant and lasting improvements to the system. There are two kinds of leverage points:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leverage Point|url=http://thwink.org/sustain/glossary/LeveragePoint.htm|website=thwink.org|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Low leverage point''' – These points are usually the places in the system where the stress is greatest. However, solving problems at these points usually doesn’t lead to a lasting improvement
* '''High leverage point''' – These points are often hidden in the system, but even smaller changes in these components can lead to significant and lasting improvements in the system as a whole

When dealing with this archetype, several generic strategies can be considered in order to solve the problem the archetype presents.

==== Reduction of Investment Delay ====
The first strategy to consider is whether it is possible to shorten the delay between the perceived need to invest and actually making an investment.

One tool one can utilize in order to shorten the delay is [[Business Process Management]], a field of study focusing on improving the efficiency of business processes. With its help, we might be able to identify the excessive delays in the investment process and shorten the delays or eliminate the parts of process that cause it entirely.

==== Plan Ahead, Identify Growth Potential ====
When the reduction of investment delay is not possible, consider having a plan in advance. This includes monitoring the right [[key performance indicators]] (some KPIs such as [[utilization rate]] might act as an inhibitor for investment, since they frown upon unused capacity) and have an investment plan prepared in advance.

Such plan can also include a stop-gap solution that can temporarily weaken the growth inhibitor, such as hiring outside help in the form of contractors or lending additional capacity. But beware to not let the stop-gap solution become a permanent one, which could become a [[Shifting the Burden]] archetype.

== Example – Home Delivery Pizza ==
A new home delivery-focused pizzeria opens up in the neighborhood. At first, the demand is low, but the pizza’s quality is excellent, as well as the delivery times. After a while, the pizzeria gets noticed and is featured in a local online food blog. As a result, the demand for the pizza rises sharply. But the pizzeria owners are reluctant to purchase more delivery capacity (pizza delivery vehicles and personnel) along with higher pizza production capacity (additional pizza ovens). That results in higher delivery times and a larger percentage of undercooked pizzas, in turn lowering the number of returning customers. As a result, the pressure for additional investment in both delivery and production capacity is eliminated. The pizzeria owners are happy that they held off on the additional investment.

[[File:Home Delivery Pizza Company - Growth and Underinvestment Archetype.PNG|none|framed|Home Delivery Pizza Company - Growth and Underinvestment Archetype]]

Such an example clearly represents a missed opportunity for further growth. It could have been avoided in two ways:
* '''Reduction of the delay in investment.''' If the owners would react quicker, they could have seized the opportunity and convert more of the opportune customers into recurring ones, creating a sustained growth.
* '''Having a plan in advance.''' This might include having a trigger for when a certain amount of pizza is delivered, that will act as an indicator that an investment is needed. Such a trigger needs to be triggered with minimal delay based on the growth variable. Also having a simulation prepared might be helpful, in order to predict the demand in the future based on the current trend, which can be used as a tool to justify the investment, shortening the time needed to make an investment decision.

== Example – Startup Company ==
The application of the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype can be especially crucial for startup businesses, which need to grow fast or might have to face failure to raise additional funds. For them, the growing concern is a [[going concern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=David|first1=Schneider|title=Growth &amp; Underinvestment - System Archetype 10|url=http://wearethepractitioners.com/library/the-practitioner/2013/08/05/growth-underinvestment---system-archetype-10|website=We Are the Practitioners|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new startup company focused on developing mobile gaming experiences has recently released its first game after successfully completing the first round of raising capital from investors. The game is initially priced at $5.99 in the Store. After the initial release, the game starts gaining a little bit of traction, but not enough to be considered a success. The company operates as usual, adding more content into the game and fixing bugs. Also, the game has an online component that is sized well for the current audience.

After several weeks, the company comes to a major decision. It will re-release the game as free, instead focusing on selling additional content on the form in in-app purchases. The strategy works and many new users start playing the game. This has two effects:
* The online component of the game becomes overloaded. It becomes clear that an investment is needed to rearchitect the component in order to scale it up without friction 
* The company is making little money from in-app purchases, since it doesn’t have a lot of premium content built for the game yet

Shortly after the free version of the game comes out, the influx of players starts to affect the online component, which occasionally crashes and disconnects users, causing them to save progress they have made in the game. The company redeploys its resources and tries to mitigate the situation by incrementally improving the online component. It is clear, however, that a complete rewrite of the online component is needed on order to eliminate the problem entirely. Therefore the company contacts its investors in order to raise additional funds to rebuild the online component.

Meanwhile, the number of active players dwindles. In response to this fact, as well as the weak cash flow generated by the game, the investor decides to take time to make the investment decision. Unfortunately, the cash flow from the game is not improving, since the remaining user base purchased the content they were interested in and new content is delayed, since most of the developers have been reassigned to solving the online component woes. In response to this, the investor sees the ever-flattening sales and dwindling user base and decides not to invest further resources into the company. A few weeks later, the company runs out of funds and declares bankruptcy.

[[File:Mobile Gaming Startup - Growth and Underinvestment Archetype.PNG|none|framed|Mobile Gaming Startup - Growth and Underinvestment Archetype]]

How such a situation could be prevented:
* The company clearly didn’t calculate with growing quickly and haven’t prepared its infrastructure for it. If it set out to build an architecture that scales out well from the outset, it would diminish the power of the slowing action significantly.
* Instead of redeploying resources when the system was under stress, it might have introduced a stop-gap solution, such as restricting the number of players online in order to keep the standard for the users that got online. Meanwhile, it would produce new content to prove to its investors, that the in-app purchase model will work in the longer-term

== Modification with a Drifting Standard ==
[[File:Growth and Underinvestment Archetype with Drifting Standard.png|none|framed|A casual loop diagram describing the Growth and Underinvestment Archetype with Drifting Standard]]
The Growth and Underinvestment with a Drifting Standard is a special case of the archetype.

It adds an additional relationship between the slowing action and the performance standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sherrer|first1=J. Alex|title=A Project Manager's Guide to Systems Thinking: Part II|url=http://www.projectsmart.co.uk/project-managers-guide-to-systems-thinking-part-2.php|website=Project Smart|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the slowing action is growing (e.g. the backlog of order is increasing in size), it has a negative effect on the performance standard (e.g. raising the maximum permitted time it takes to deliver an order). The rest of the system behaves in the same way as the original archetype.

This additional relationship can have severe consequences, since in some cases the performance standard can have major contribution to pressure exerted on individuals deciding whether to make the investment. With the slowing action actively undermining the performance standard, it can be harder to find the incentive to invest into additional resources.

== Related Archetypes ==
The Growth and Underinvestment Archetype can be considered to be an elaboration o the [http://www.systems-thinking.org/arch/arch.htm#archls Limits to Success archetype].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bellinger|first1=Gene|author-link=Gene Bellinger|title=Archetypes|url=http://www.systems-thinking.org/arch/arch.htm#archgu|website=Systems Thinking|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It adds another feedback loop which effectively elaborates the Limiting State part of the Limits to Success archetype.

The '''International Standard Classification of Education''' ('''ISCED''') is a statistical framework for organizing information on [[education]] maintained by the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]]. It is a member of the international family of economic and social classifications of the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unstats.un.org/unsd/class/ United Nations Statistics Division: ''UN Classifications Registry''], retrieved 30-03-2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ISCED was designed in the early 2009 to serve ‘as an instrument suitable for assembling, compiling and presenting statistics of education both within individual countries and internationally’.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2016. ''International Standard Classification of Education: ISCED 2001'. http://www.uis.unesco.org/Library/Documents/isced97-en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The first version, known as ISCED 2001, was approved by the International Conference on Education (Geneva, 1975), and was subsequently endorsed by UNESCO’s 19th General Conference in 1976.

The second version, known as ISCED 1997, was approved by the UNESCO General Conference at its 29th session in November 1997 as part of efforts to increase the international comparability of education statistics. It covered primarily two cross-classification variables: ''levels'' (7) and ''fields'' of education (25). The UNESCO Institute for Statistics led the development of a third version, which was adopted by UNESCO’s 36th General Conference in November 2011 and which will replace ISCED 1997 in international data collections in the coming years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/Documents/isced-2011-en.pdf Revision of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)], retrieved 05-04-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ISCED 2011 has 9 rather than 7 levels, created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels. It also extended the lowest level (ISCED 0) to cover a new sub-category of early childhood educational development programmes, which target children below the age of 3 years.

During the review and revision, which led to the adoption of ISCED 2011, UNESCO Member States agreed that the fields of education should be examined in a separate process. This review is now underway with the view to establishing an independent but related classification called the ISCED Fields of Education and Training.

Related materials from the [[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training]] and also [[Eurostat]] provide further information and statistical guidance for the classification of sub-fields of education as a companion to ISCED.&lt;ref&gt;European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training and Eurostat. 1999.

| Pre-primary education
| Initial stage of organized instruction, designed primarily to introduce very young children to a school-type environment and to develop their cognitive, physical, social and emotional skills. Designed for children from age 3 to the start of primary education.
|-
|  1
| [[Primary education]] or first stage of [[basic education]]
| Normally starting between the ages of 5 – 7, designed to give a sound basic education in reading, writing and mathematics along with an elementary understanding of other subjects.
|-
|  2
| [[Lower secondary school|Lower secondary education]] or second stage of [[basic education]]
| Designed to complete basic education, usually on a more subject-oriented pattern. It builds upon the learning outcomes from primary education (ISCED level 1) and aims to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human development.
|-
|  3
| [[Upper secondary school|Upper secondary education]]
| More specialized education typically beginning at age 15 or 16 years and/or completes secondary education in preparation for tertiary education, or to provide skills relevant to employment, or both.
|-
|  4
| Post-secondary non-tertiary education
| Programmes that straddle the boundary between upper- and post-secondary education from an international point of view. ISCED level 4 programmes, considering their content, cannot be regarded as tertiary programmes. They are often not significantly more advanced than programmes at ISCED level 3 but they serve to broaden the knowledge of participants who have already completed a programme at level 3.
|-
|  5
| First stage of tertiary education  
| Tertiary programmes having an educational content more advanced than those offered at ISCED levels 3 and 4. These programmes may be academically based or practically oriented / occupationally specific. Entry to these programmes normally requires the successful completion of ISCED level 3A or 3B or a similar qualification at ISCED level 4A. All degrees and qualifications are cross-classified by type of programmes, position in national degree or qualification structures and cumulative duration at tertiary.
|-
|  6
| Second stage of tertiary education 
| Tertiary programmes leading to the award of an advanced research qualification, e.g. [[Ph.D.]] These programmes are therefore devoted to advanced study and original research and are not based on course-work only. It typically requires the submission of a thesis or dissertation of publishable quality which is the product of original research and represents a significant contribution to knowledge.

'''James Haughton Jr.''' (1929-2016) was a prominent American [[Civil rights movement|civil rights]] activist, labor leader, [[Community organizing|community organizer]], and social worker. Haughton is most widely known for advocating for racial equality within the construction industry.

== Personal Life ==
James Haughton was born on October 1929 in Brooklyn, New York to James Haughton Sr. and Mary Miller, both immigrants from the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/nyregion/james-haughton-who-fought-racial-barriers-in-building-trades-dies-at-86.html|title=James Haughton, Who Fought Racial Barriers in Building Trades, Dies at 86|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haughton received a BSS from the [[City College of New York]] in 1951 and an [[Master of Public Administration|MPA]] from [[New York University]] in 1960. From 1951 to 1953 Haughton fought in the [[Korean War]] as a US Army lieutenant.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.nypl.org/scm/20945|title=archives.nypl.org -- James Haughton Papers|website=archives.nypl.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1955 to 1960, Haughton worked with gangs in Los Angeles and New York City as a youth counselor and social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/nyregion/james-haughton-who-fought-racial-barriers-in-building-trades-dies-at-86.html|title=James Haughton, Who Fought Racial Barriers in Building Trades, Dies at 86|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Haughton married prominent anthropologist, social theorist, and feminist [[Eleanor Leacock|Elanor Leacock]] and remained with her until her death in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56014756|title=Notable American women : a biographical dictionary completing the twentieth century|last=|first=|date=2004|publisher=Belknap Press|others=Ware, Susan, 1950-, Braukman, Stacy Lorraine., Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study.|year=|isbn=067401488X|location=Cambridge, Mass|pages=374|oclc=56014756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
In 1960, Haughton joined the newly formed Negro American Labor Council (NALC), remaining involved with the organization until his 1962 departure. Following his involvement with NALC, Haughton served as chairman of the Labor and Industry Committee of the New York Branch of the [[NAACP]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Frustrated with a perceived passivity within established civil rights organizations, Haughton, in 1964, established the Harlem Unemployment Center. The organization, renamed Fight Back in 1969, employed more aggressive tactics in advocating for minority hiring in the construction industry, equal employment opportunities, and minority—particularly Black and Puerto Rican— inclusion in unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/7038/|title=James Haughton on Racism in the House of Labor|last=Jackson|first=Janine|date=1999|website=George Mason University|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://amsterdamnews.com/news/2016/may/12/james-haughton-crusader-against-construction-indus/|title=James Haughton, crusader against the construction industry|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Haughton was involved in a number of other causes including the [[anti-war movement]], [[anti-nuclear movement]], [[Anti-Apartheid Movement|anti-Apartheid movement]], and Puerto Rico solidarity movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.worldcat.org/archivegrid/collection/data/436872248|title=James Haughton papers, 1924-1984 (bulk 1959-1982)|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''JobShopLean''' is a concept for applying the philosophy of Lean to the type of usually small manufacturing organization known as a [[job shop]]. 

Unlike continuous (Flow) manufacturing as practised by Toyota, this manufacturing is characterized by skilled hourly employees such as machinists, diemakers, welders, pipefitters, painters, etc. that perform non-repetitive manufacturing operations, often based on them determine the manufacturing processes and sequences. [[Lean manufacturing]] is the concept of doing all this as efficiently as possible.

{{main|Bottling (concert abuse)}}

==1970s==
* ''[[Metallic K.O.]]'' is an infamous live recording by [[The Stooges]]. During much of the performance, [[Iggy Pop]] sings while pieces of ice, eggs, beer bottles and jelly beans, among other things, are thrown at him in response to his audience-baiting. In the essay "Iggy Pop: Blowtorch in Bondage" critic [[Lester Bangs]] calls the album a "documentation of the Iggy holocaust at its most nihilistically out of control." He describes the Stooges concert he attended that immediately preceded the ''Metallic K.O.'' performances:
{{cquote|''The audience, which consisted largely of bikers, was unusually hostile, and Iggy, as usual, fed on that hostility, soaked it up and gave it back and absorbed it all over again in an eerie, frightening symbiosis. "All right," he finally said, stopping a song in the middle, "you assholes wanta hear 'Louie, Louie,' we'll give you 'Louie, Louie.'" So the Stooges played a forty-five-minute version of "Louie Louie," including new lyrics improvised by the Pop on the spot consisting of "You can suck my ass / You biker faggot sissies," etc.

''By now the hatred in the room is one huge livid wave, and Iggy singles out one heckler who has been particularly abusive: "Listen, asshole, you heckle me one more time and I'm gonna come down there and kick your ass." "Fuck you, you little punk," responds the biker. So Iggy jumps off the stage, runs through the middle of the crowd, and the guy beats the shit out of him, ending the evening's musical festivities by sending the lead singer back to his motel room and a doctor. I walk into the dressing room, where I encounter the manager of the club offering to punch out anybody in the band who will take him on. The next day the bike gang, who call themselves the Scorpions, will phone WABX-FM and promise to kill Iggy and the Stooges if they play the Michigan Palace on Thursday night. They do (play, that is), and nobody gets killed, but ''Metallic K.O.'' is the only rock album I know where you can actually hear hurled beer bottles breaking against guitar strings.''}}

* On June 3, 1977, restless fans threw rocks and bottles at [[Led Zeppelin]] when a concert in [[Tampa, Florida]] ended early due to a thunderstorm, even though the tickets said "rain or shine", resulting in a small riot that left over 100 injured due to [[crowd crushing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=June 3, 1977|url=http://www.ledzeppelin.com/node/789/257|website=Led Zeppelin official site|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1978, [[AC/DC]] were bottled on stage at the [[Seattle Center Coliseum]], in which [[Angus Young]] got onto [[Bon Scott]]'s shoulders and walked into the audience, but the band continued playing after this incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1978 "Powerage" US Tour|url=http://www.ac-dc.net/archives/review.php?date_id=1091|website=AC/DC.net|accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Various objects, including sandwiches and bottles were thrown at [[Ramones|The Ramones]] at the Canadian World Music Festival in [[Toronto]] in July 1979, ending with [[Johnny Ramone]] "[[The finger|flipping them off]]" 5 or 6 songs into the set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ramones "Flipping The Bird" After Getting Booed Off The Stage|url=http://www.feelnumb.com/2014/04/06/ramones-flipping-the-bird-after-getting-booed-off-the-stage/|website=Feelnumb.com|accessdate=20 September 2015|date=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At a [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] concert in [[Madison Square Garden]] on October 12, 1979, a fan threw a rose onstage, and it hit [[Ian Anderson]], wounding his eye with a thorn. The band was forced to cancel the next two shows while Anderson recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oldies.about.com/od/oldieshistory/a/october12.htm|title=Today in Oldies Music History - October 12 - This Day in Oldies History - October 12 in Music|author=Robert Fontenot|work=About.com Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/entertainment/12008773147699/entertainment-history-oct-12-2012/&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared at subsequent concert dates wearing protective goggles.

==1980s==

* In 1989 a very young [[Texas (band)|Texas]] were opening for [[Simple Minds]] in [[Cardiff Arms Park]]. The band temporarily halted the show due to being continually pelted by a sea of plastic bottles. Lead singer [[Sharleen Spiteri]] angrily chastised the crowd who stopped throwing in response: "Do you think it is alright to throw bottles at a wee lassie up here on stage?" at which point a lone bottle was thrown, it arched through the air towards the band and as was clearly seen on the large stage monitors hit Spiteri directly on the head. A huge cheer went up and a deluge of bottles followed, not letting up until Spiteri and Texas had stormed off stage.{{citation needed|reason=this does not read as a documented event but as an oft exaggerated story from your youth|date=March 2015}}

==1990s==
* [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] were bottled during a [[Lollapalooza]] event in [[West Virginia]] in 1995 with mud. A rock hit [[Stephen Malkmus]] in the chest, causing Malkmus to storm off stage, abruptly ending their set. The incident is featured in the documentary [[Slow Century]]. 
*[[Everclear (band)|Everclear]] front man [[Art Alexakis]] was pegged in the mouth with a full water bottle at some point during the So Much for the Afterglow tour. The bottle knocked loose one of his front teeth.
* At a November 5, 1993 concert at [[Empire Polo Club]] while opening for [[U2 (band)|U2]], [[Pearl Jam]] were pelted by hundreds of shoes thrown by the audience, and were forced to play behind their amplifiers. [[Eddie Vedder]] addressed the crowd, joking that he and [[Jeff Ament]] were going to be at the gate after the show and beat up every barefoot person they see. He then stated that instead, the band were going to donate the shoes to charity. A recording of the incident was included on Pearl Jam's 1993 Fan Club Holiday Single, and the recording of the song "Blood" was included as a [[b-side]] on the [[Daughter (song)|Daughter single]].
* The [[Sex Pistols]] were bottled off stage at Denmark's [[Roskilde Festival]] in 1996. The band left the stage briefly after only two songs but returned to play another three. [[John Lydon|Johnny Rotten]] asked the crowd to stop; however, bottling continued and the band ended their set with Rotten criticising the crowd for failing to "police themselves".
* On June 17, 1997 at an [[Ozzfest]] event, concert goers began throwing bottles at the bands on stage, smashed box office windows, started fires, and overturned cars after the announcement that [[Ozzy Osbourne]] would not perform.   
* A full bottle of [[Sprite (drink)|Sprite]] was thrown at [[James (band)|James]] as they performed at [[V Festival]] in the mid-'90s. It struck lead guitarist [[Adrian Oxaal]] on the head and temporarily dazed him; after a few moments, he continued to play and the set finished without further incident.
* During her performance at [[Pinkpop Festival|Pinkpop]] 1998, some people in the audience threw a couple of eggs at Dutch singer [[Anouk (singer)|Anouk]]. In response, she took off her shirt and finished her performance in a red bra, as was shown on Dutch television.
* [[Silverchair]]'s [[Daniel Johns]] had a bottle thrown at him during a performance in early 1995 at [[Santa Monica Pier]] when he was 15 years old. He received multiple stitches to his eyebrow, which he later turned into an eyebrow piercing.

The band eventually came back onstage and finished their set.
* In 1999, [[Kevin Rowland]] was bottled at Reading Festival, after appearing wearing a dress and stockings and being accompanied by two female dancers in stockings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/sep/19/2 "I was nuts"], [[The Guardian]], 19 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[Woodstock 99]] festival, Canadian folk rock band [[The Tragically Hip]] were pelted with rocks and bottles by audience members who were there to see harder metal acts on the bill like [[Kid Rock]] and [[Rage Against the Machine]]. Some American concertgoers reportedly taunted the band and their fans by singing "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" while the group performed a brief rendition of "[[O Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kreps |first1=Daniel |title=19 Worst Things About Woodstock '99 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/19-worst-things-about-woodstock-99-176052/ |website=Rolling Stone |accessdate=19 November 2018 |date=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000s==

* [[Daphne and Celeste]] were heavily bottled at the [[Reading Festival]], and left the stage at the start of their last song. [[Pop punk]] favorites [[Blink-182]] were scheduled to follow them later that day.&lt;ref name= daph /&gt; The duo accused the crowd of "Wasting so much food", which was one of the items thrown at them. The duo themselves have differing opinions if this incident was the beginning of the end of their time together.

===2001===
* [[Marilyn Manson]] Was bottled during [[OzzFest]] at [[The Docks]] in Toronto. A fan threw a water bottle at the stage during the song [[The Nobodies (song)]] just before the end. Immediately bassist [[Twiggy Ramirez]] pointed it out to Marilyn, following that he demanded that the fan who threw it would come come on stage for a "duel". The fan came up and was counted down, he threw the bottle and then was hit with by many more water bottles from the crowd including Marilyn's. Following losing the "duel" Marilyn then said "Who's got the good aim now? You fucking bitch. Get the fuck off my stage, you pussy", then proceeded to play their song [[Rock Is Dead (Marilyn Manson song)|Rock Is Dead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gösta Hare|title=Marilyn Manson invites bottle throwing "fan" to the stage.

* At the Sydney [[Big Day Out]] in 2004, restless [[Metallica]] fans waiting for the band to play threw bottles at [[The Strokes]] during their set on the adjacent stage.

*[[Bring Me the Horizon]] were bottled at the 2008 Reading Festival when appearing as a last-minute replacement for [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], after drummer [[Joey Jordison]] broke his ankle. The band were heavily bottled which caused singer [[Oliver Sykes]], to respond to the abuse by saying "It looks a right mess up here on this stage, you obviously don't like our band but that's okay". Other items thrown were crisps and [[woodchips]] from the floor.

They would later return to the main stage, but with a positive reception.
* Later on in the day, American alternative rock band [[The Plain White T's]] were bottled during the early stages of their set. The abuse was put down to the demographic their music was aimed at, as [[Metallica]] were that day's headliners.
* [[Lethal Bizzle]] was heavily bottled during his set at the 2008 [[Download Festival]] as he was the only act on the bill not associated with rock or heavy metal.

* [[Black Veil Brides]] suffered bottling abuse from metal fans at June 2012's [[Download Festival]]. The lead singer, [[Andy Biersack]], responded to this by "mooning" the crowd. On the Download 2012 Sky Arts highlights, Biersack can clearly be seen in the Black Veil Brides video narrowly avoiding a launched bottle during "[[Fallen Angels (song)|Fallen Angels]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="133196">On a number of occasions throughout history, notable sporting participants have been involved in violent confrontations with spectators during a competition. This list includes events in which a spectator at a sporting event was engaged in such a confrontation with an athlete, coach or game official, either through the spectator's intrusion upon the field of play, or (as a result of such an event) a participant entering the spectator seating area. Incidents of object or snow throwing are included when it results in injuries to a match participant or causes significant delays or cancellation of the event.

It does ''not'' include incidents of [[riot]]s or other violence, often outside the event venue, which did not involve game participants.

* August 21 – In the bottom of the 4th inning of an American League Baseball game between [[New York Yankees|the then-Baltimore Orioles]] and the [[Detroit Tigers]] at Baltimore, the Tigers were leading 7-4 when the lead-off batter for Baltimore was called out at first base; Orioles players surrounded and argued with umpire Tom Connolly about the call, and a bench-clearing brawl broke out. Fans responded by invading the field and storming the box office for refunds, with Orioles pitcher Joe McGinnity being ejected for spitting in Connolly's eyes, Detroit's [[Kid Elberfeld]] exchanging punches with Baltimore's Mike Donlin before Donlin's teammate [[Bill Keister]] got involved, and Connolly was assaulted by fans as he escaped to the groundskeeper's office, staying there for over an hour before the crowd thinned out enough for him to leave, with McGinnity, Elberfeld, Keister and a fan being arrested and escorted off the field by police. McGinnity was suspended for 10 games, the fan was fined $100 for disorderly conduct, and the game was ruled a forfeit to the Tigers.&lt;ref name="Forfeits in Major League Baseball"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/forfeits.htm|title=Forfeits|publisher=|accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1901#August Baseball in 1901] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406025016/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/chronology/byyear.php?year=1901 |date=2013-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three players were suspended for four matches each by the VFL.&lt;ref name="100years"/&gt;

==1909==

Fans also brawled with and assaulted police and firefighters when they arrived, destroyed the goals and fencing, and lit numerous fires throughout the arena. It took authorities 2½ hours to break up the riots and bring the fires under control, by which time £1000 in damage had been done; 58 police officers and 60 other people were injured. The 1909 Scottish Cup and all medals were withheld.
* September 4 – During a VFL match between [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] and Melbourne at Victoria Park, a Collingwood fan jumped the fence and punched a Melbourne player in the face.

[[File:Ty-Cobb-1913-NPC-detail-1.jpeg|right|80px|[[Ty Cobb]]]]
* May 15 – During the sixth inning of a game between the [[New York Highlanders]] and the [[Detroit Tigers]] at [[Hilltop Park]] in New York, Tigers outfielder [[Ty Cobb]] ran into the stands and assaulted a handicapped fan, Claude Lueker, after Lueker had heckled him throughout the first three innings (reportedly saying "I don't care if he's got no feet!" when called out on this). Cobb was ejected, and he was suspended indefinitely and fined $50 for the incident.

They were given two 90-second ultimatums but the 65ers never came out. It was only then the Zoom Masters were declared champions by game forfeiture. Team manager Navarro later said that the decision to walkout was from his fear that something more untoward would happen if his team continued on with the game.  The 65ers were fined a total of P550,000 for the walkout.

* December 16 – During an NFL game between the [[Cleveland Browns]] and the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], the referees took the unusual step of reviewing a play that had happened three plays earlier, citing technical difficulties (normally under NFL rules, only the last play made can be reviewed). Browns fans angered by the overturning of the call on that play with 48 seconds left in the fourth quarter threw beer bottles, cups and garbage onto the field, with officials as well as players on both teams being hit, resulting in a thirty-minute delay. Initially the game was called, with [[CBS]] announcers [[Gus Johnson (sportscaster)|Gus Johnson]] and [[Boomer Esiason]]—who played for the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] during the "You don't live in Cleveland" incident—highly critical of the fans' conduct and the officials' handling of the incident.

Al-Masry fans reacted first by attacking Ahli players, then opposing fans. Fights from the stands poured out onto the field, causing riots and eventual civil unrest. The rioting resulted in 73 deaths and at least 1,000 injured, making it the worst disaster in the history of soccer in that nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/25-people-dead-egyptian-soccer-pitch-invasion-tv-190605203--soccer.html|title=More than 70 die in Egyptian soccer pitch invasion|last1=El Madany|first1=Sherine|last2=Abdelatti|first2=Ali|date=February 1, 2012|agency=Reuters|publisher=Yahoo.com|accessdate=2012-02-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203152603/http://ca.news.yahoo.com/25-people-dead-egyptian-soccer-pitch-invasion-tv-190605203--soccer.html|archivedate=February 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A {{nihongo|'''local hero'''|ローカルヒーロー|rōkaru hīrō|also written as {{nihongo3||ご当地ヒーロー|gotōchi hīrō}}}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[superhero]] who is created to represent a particular region of Japan, such as a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] or city. They often perform in special [[martial arts]] [[stage show]]s. Created either by local groups or the [[local government]], a local hero is modeled after the superheroes of Japanese [[tokusatsu]]. A local hero is often themed around the city or prefecture's local mythologies or industries, are created to teach the children who watch the stage shows certain things (like {{nihongo|Recycle Sentai Wakerunger|リサイクル戦隊ワケルンジャー|Risaikuru Sentai Wakerunjā}} of [[Fukui, Fukui|Fukui]], [[Fukui Prefecture]]), or are themed after the event that they are used to promote (the {{nihongo|Traffic Sentai Anzenger|トラフィック戦隊アンゼンジャー|Torafikku Sentai Anzenjā}} group performed at the [[Tokyo Motor Show]] to act in both the latter forms for [[road traffic safety]]).

Although local heroes are produced to act in a local area, some gain fame throughout Japan by performing at other local heroes' shows or being featured in mainstream media. {{nihongo|[[Chōjin Neiger]]|超神ネイガー|Chōjin Neigā|extra=translated as "Super-God Neiger" or "Neiger The Hero"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage1.nifty.com/nexus/neiger/|title=超神ネイガー|accessdate=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Nikaho, Akita|Nikaho]], [[Akita Prefecture]], has had two theme songs recorded by [[anison]] recording artist [[Ichirou Mizuki]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neiger.la.coocan.jp/kirokuhtmls/kiroku1a.htm|title=活動記録 平成19年10月|date=October 2007|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the first of which was previously available on the Japanese [[iTunes Store]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaplog.jp/allenkk/archive/796|title=豪石！超神ネイガー-ALLEN's BLOG|date=2007-08-14|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a subsequent EP featuring [[Mitsuko Horie]]'s vocals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage1.nifty.com/nexus/neiger/products/music_radio.htm|title=【関連商品】■音楽／ラジオ|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.jp.msn.com/news/2776.htm|title=秋田のヒーロー"超神ネイガー"、ミニアルバム発売　MSNミュージック 音楽ニュース|date=2007-06-07| accessdate=2010-01-12| archivedate=2008-06-16| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616205623/http://music.jp.msn.com/news/2776.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{nihongo|[[Ryujin Mabuyer]]|琉神マブヤー|Ryūjin Mabuyā}} from [[Okinawa Prefecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mabuyer.com/index.html|title=琉神マブヤー公式WEBサイト：ニライカナイからやってきた魂の戦士「琉神マブヤー」|accessdate=2010-01-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127112237/http://www.mabuyer.com/index.html|archivedate=2010-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was featured in his own [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] television series. {{nihongo|[[Maburittokiba]]|マブリットキバ}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maburittokiba.web.fc2.com/index.html|title=マブリットキバ：公式サイト　トップ|accessdate=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Tōno, Iwate|Tōno]], [[Iwate Prefecture]], was featured in an episode of the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] program ''Kizuna Dining'' when they visited Tōno and appears at hero shows throughout Japan.

The anime ''[[Tentai Senshi Sunred]]'' is based on the local hero theme, featuring the title character as the protector of the city of [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]].

Another TV tokusatsu series, [[Houjin Yatsurugi]] was shown as the local hero in Chiba.

In 2008, [[Symantec]] created the character of {{nihongo|[[Norton Fighter]]|[[:ja:ノートンファイター|ノートンファイター]]|Nōton Faitā}} for its Japanese advertising campaign alongside celebrity otaku [[Shoko Nakagawa]] for their new software, including several other characters to go with him. [[Hironobu Kageyama]] has recorded a song for Norton Fighter as well titled {{nihongo|"Bōei Senshi! Norton Fighter"|防衛戦士！ノートン・ファイター|Bōei Senshi! Nōton Faitā}}. As a local hero, Norton Fighter is based in the [[Akihabara]] region of [[Tokyo]].

'''[[Lorenzo Valla]]'s Dialogue on Free Will''' (''De libero arbitrio'') is one in a series of dialogues written by Valla throughout his lifetime. The work discusses his views on the concept of [[free will]] as it pertains the Catholic Church's opinion on predestination at the time. The concept of [[predestination]], in the opinion of the Catholic Church, deals with the fact that God has predetermined our lives, and that he knows how we will act. Many philosophers of the time argued that if humans' lives are in fact predetermined by God, than in reality the concept of free will is simply an illusion. Essentially the argument is that if God has created us already knowing the decisions we will make, than those decisions are not actually ours. Valla, through a fictional dialogue amongst the work's characters, defends the idea that the concepts of predetermination and free will can coexist. In the work, Valla states that he is attempting to directly refute the works of the 6th century philosopher [[Boethius]].

==Background==
Lorenzo Valla was an Italian [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] who lived during the 15th century. Valla was born in Rome in 1406. Valla's family had close ties to the papal curia, putting him in close contact with many established Church figures at an early age. Many of these figures were also thinkers who abided by humanist ideologies. One such humanist was Melchior Scrivani, who served as a papal secretary. Scrivani was also Valla's uncle. Lorenzo Valla hoped to one day succeed his uncle, and from early on in his career, he had a desire to leave his impact on the papacy and the Catholic Church. Valla faced criticisms from his peers within Rome which eventually forced him to leave for Pavia in 1431. Valla taught  for three years in Pavia, eventually leaving to serves as a member of Alfonso of Aragon's court. Disputes between the Aragones and the papacy, in which Valla played a central role, left Valla with a renewed desire to leave his mark in Rome, even after the Argonese settled their differences with the papacy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/622198/Lorenzo-Valla&lt;/ref&gt;

==Valla as a humanist==
As a humanist, Valla spent much of his early career writing on the importance of the Latin language to scholarly society. [[Renaissance humanism]] concentrates itself around the importance of Latin as the international language of scholars. Most Renaissance humanists, and Valla in particular, recognized and stressed the importance of rhetoric and language. Valla was known for his critiques of classical scholastic thought, and his ideas on the reformation of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] logic.

==Valla's dialogue on free will==
As mentioned, Valla wrote his dialogue on free will (de libero arbitrio) with the intent of proving that the ideas of predetermination and free will could co-exist within the Catholic Church. Lorenzo Valla argued, not only in his dialogue on free will, that free will was essential to the make up of human morality. This is belief is central to his theologies, and is one of the main reasons for his strong attempts to defend the concept.

Valla chronicles a fictional dialogue between two protagonists and through their conversation, expresses his own ideas on the issue. The first of the two main characters is Antonio Glarea, an educated man who Valla identifies as being from San Lorenzo. The second is a man named Lorenzo, and it is safe to assume that Lorenzo's comments throughout the dialogue are meant to represent those of Lorenzo Valla. The two engage in an intensely theoretical debate. Eventually, Valla's conclusions become evident to the reader. Many critics argue that although Valla argues his points passionately, many of his conclusions are inconclusive.

After a brief introduction by Valla, in which he outlines his reasons for writing the piece, he begins the dialogue with a statement by Antonio. The general point of Antonio's first statement is to express his utter confusion in regards to grasping the concept of free will. Antonio's initial comments are not as forceful as they become later in the dialogue. At this point in the work Antonio is simply expressing his frustrations with his inability to understand free will as the Church defines it.

Valla's character Lorenzo addresses Antonio's questions about free will by explaining that the free will of humans' lies in their decision to live good or bad lives morally. He argues that God has given each person certain characteristics, and that we are free to decide how we use those attributes. Lorenzo speaks about how the differences amongst our characteristics are things that God knows, and that we can not know about all of the things we don't have, and that we are best to just do all that we can to make the best of what we know we do have. The heart of Lorenzo's initial argument is that although God does know who we are and what we are going to do, we still have the ability to decide to live within God's grace and make the most of what we have.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sophia.org/lorenzo-valla-an-interpretation-of-the-dialogue-on-tutorial&lt;/ref&gt;

Antonio and Lorenzo go on to agree on the terms of the concepts of free will and predestination. It is important to note that both Antonio and Lorenzo consider themselves to be devout Roman Catholics. The two agree that in terms of the Catholic Church's view of predestination, that God does indeed know how we will act. The two also agree that the term free will can be defined as the ability for humans to make decisions about their actions. Antonio's main argument is that if God knows what we are going to do and he has created us, that God can not hold us accountable for our sins.

Valla attempts to counter Antonio through numerous historical examples where he argues that God's foreknowledge of our action does not affect the morality of the decision at hand. He uses the example of the betrayal of Jesus by Judas. Initially Antonio claims that Lorenzo is simply bringing him back to his initial confusion on the issue of free will. After further discussion however Antonio admits that Lorenzo's arguments have persuaded him to recognize the compatibility of predestination and free will.

==Criticisms==
Many critics of Valla argue that although he makes strong arguments, he bases many of them on the inability of humans to grasp God's ability to know everything. Many of Valla's arguments demand the human concession that many aspects of God and faith are never going to be able to be understood. Oftentimes Valla resorts to making that claim that many of the counter arguments he is presented with are in fact heretical.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lorenzo-valla/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Mand (disambiguation){{!}}Mand}}
'''Mand''' is a term that [[B.F. Skinner]] used to describe a verbal [[operant conditioning|operant]] in which the response is reinforced by a characteristic consequence and is therefore under the functional control of relevant conditions of deprivation or aversive stimulation. One cannot determine, based on form alone, whether a response is a mand; it is necessary to know the kinds of variables controlling a response in order to identify a verbal operant. A mand is sometimes said to "specify its reinforcement" although this is not always the case. Skinner introduced the mand as one of six primary verbal operants in his 1957 work, ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''.

Chapter three of Skinner's work, ''Verbal Behavior'', discusses a functional relationship called the mand. A mand is a form of verbal behavior that is controlled by deprivation, satiation, or what is now called motivating operations (MO), as well as a controlling history. An example of this would be asking for water when one is water deprived ("thirsty"). It is tempting to say that a mand ''describes its reinforcer'', which it sometimes does. But many mands have no correspondence to the reinforcer. For example, a loud knock may be a mand "open the door" and a servant may be called by a hand clap as much as a child might "ask for milk."

Mands differ from other verbal operants in that they primarily benefit the speaker, whereas other verbal operants function primarily for the benefit of the listener. This is not to say that mands function exclusively in favor of the speaker, however; Skinner gives the example of the advice, "Go west!" as having the potential to yield consequences which will be reinforcing to both speaker and listener. When warnings such as "Look out!" are heeded, the listener may avoid aversive stimulation.

The Lamarre &amp; Holland (1985) study on mands would be one example of a research study in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Lamarre |first=J. |last2=Holland |first2=J.G. |year=1985 |title=The functional independence of mands and tacts |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=5–19 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1985.43-5 |pmid=16812407 |pmc=1348092}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dynamic properties==
The mand form, being under the control of deprivation and stimulation, will vary in energy level. Dynamic qualities are to be understood as variations that arise as a function of multiple causes. Dynamic in this case is opposed how someone reading from a text might sound if they do not simulate the normal dynamic qualities of verbal behavior. Mands tend to be permanent when they are acquired.&lt;ref&gt;Wacker, D.P.; Harding, J.W. &amp; Berg, W.K. (2008). Evaluation of Mand-Reinforcer Relations Following Long-Term Functional Communication Training. ''Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis'', 3(1), 25. [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extended mands==
Emitting mands to objects or animals that cannot possibly supply an appropriate response would be an example of the extended mand. Telling "stop!" to someone out of earshot, perhaps in a film, who is about to hurt themselves is an example of the extended mand. Extended mands occur due to extended [[stimulus control]]. In the case of an extended mand, the listener is unable to deliver consequences that would reinforce the mand, but they have enough in common with listeners that have previously reinforced the mand that stimulus control can be inferred.

===Superstitious mands===
Mands directed to inanimate objects may be said to be superstitious mands. Mands to an unreliable car to "come on and start" for example may be due to a history of [[intermittent reinforcement]].

===Magical mands===
A magical mand is a mand form where the consequences specified in the mand have never occurred. The form "Give me a million dollars" has never before produced a million dollars and so would be classified as a magical mand. Skinner posits that many literary mands are of the magical form. Prayer might also be analyzed as belonging in one of the above three categories, depending upon one's opinion of the likelihood and mechanism of its answer.

==Clinical application==
Failure to mand adequately appears to be correlated with destructive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, W.W. (2001) Functional Analysis of Precurrent Contingencies Between Mands and Destructive Behavior. ''The Behavior Analyst Today'', 2(3), 176–85 [http://www.baojournal.com BAO]&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be especially true for those with [[developmental disabilities]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4635">'''Marconi's law''' is the relation between length of [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]] and maximum signaling distance of [[radio transmission]]s. [[Guglielmo Marconi]] enunciated at one time an [[empirical law]] that, for [[radio transmitter|simple vertical sending]] and [[radio receiver|receiving antennas]] of equal height, the maximum working [[radio telegraphy|telegraphic]] distance varied as the square of the height of the antenna. It has been stated that the rule was tested in experiments made on [[Salisbury Plain]] in 1897, and also by experiments made by Italian [[naval officer]]s on behalf of the [[Royal Italian Navy]] in 1900 and 1901. [[Captain (nautical)|Captain]] [[Quintino Bonomo]] gave a report of these experiments in an official report.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Description==
{{expand section|date=December 2010}}
&lt;!-- Need the equation put in here --&gt;

If ''H'' is the height (i.e. the length) of the antenna and ''D'' the maximum signalling distance, then we have, according to ''Marconi's law''
: &lt;math&gt;H = c \sqrt{D}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''c'' is some constant.

''Marconi's law'' can be deduced theoretically as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, J. A. (1906). The principles of electric wave telegraphy. London: Longmans, Green, and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Heinrich Hertz|Hertz]] has shown that distances large compared with its length the magnetic force of a linear oscillator varies inversely as the distance. The maximum value of the current set up in any given receiving antenna varies as its length, also as the magnetic force of the waves incident on it, and as the maximum value of the current in the transmitting antenna. Hence, if &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic force of the waves incident on a receiving antenna of height H, and if &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the sending and receiving antenna, and if &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt; are the maximum values of the currents in the sending and receiving antennæ, we have—

&lt;math&gt;M \propto \frac{I_1}{D}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_2 \propto MH&lt;/math&gt;

Hence &lt;math&gt;I_2 \propto \frac{I_2H}{D}&lt;/math&gt;

Also, since for a given charging voltage the current &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; in the sending antenna varies very nearly as its capacity—that is, as its height—and if the sending antenna has the same height, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, as the receiving aerial, we have—

&lt;math&gt;I_1 \propto H&lt;/math&gt;

But &lt;math&gt;I_2 \propto \frac{I_1H}{D}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore &lt;math&gt;I_2 \propto \frac{H^2}{D} \propto&lt;/math&gt; some constant

For any given receiving apparatus a certain constant minimum value of the maximum current in the receiving antenna is necessary to cause a signal. Therefore it follows that, with given receiving and sending apparatus, we must have &lt;math&gt;\frac{H^2}{D}&lt;/math&gt; a constant, or—

&lt;math&gt;H = c \sqrt{D}&lt;/math&gt;

That is, the maximum signalling distance with given apparatus will vary as the square of the height of the antenna.

The above law is, however, much interfered with by the nature of the surface over which the propagation takes place.

A '''node''' is a point along a [[standing wave]] where the wave has minimum [[amplitude]].  For instance, in a vibrating [[guitar]] string, the ends of the string are nodes.  By changing the position of the end node through [[frets]], the guitarist changes the effective length of the [[vibrating string]] and thereby the [[Musical note|note]] played. The opposite of a node is an '''anti-node''', a point where the amplitude of the standing wave is a maximum.  These occur midway between the nodes.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite book

In a standing wave the '''nodes''' are a series of locations at equally spaced intervals where the wave [[amplitude]] (motion) is zero (see animation above).  At these points the two waves add with opposite [[phase (waves)|phase]] and cancel each other out.  They occur at intervals of half a [[wavelength]] (λ/2).  Midway between each pair of nodes are locations where the amplitude is maximum.  These are called the '''antinodes'''.  At these points the two waves add with the same phase and reinforce each other.

In cases where the two opposite wave trains are not the same amplitude, they do not cancel perfectly, so the amplitude of the standing wave at the nodes is not zero but merely a minimum.  This occurs when the reflection at the boundary is imperfect.  This is indicated by a finite [[standing wave ratio]] (SWR), the ratio of the amplitude of the wave at the antinode to the amplitude at the node.

In [[resonance]] of a [[two dimensional]] surface or membrane, such as a [[drumhead]] or vibrating metal plate, the nodes become nodal lines, lines on the surface where the surface is motionless, dividing the surface into separate regions vibrating with opposite phase.  These can be made visible by sprinkling sand on the surface, and the intricate patterns of lines resulting are called [[Chladni figure]]s.

In [[transmission line]]s a [[voltage]] node is a [[Electric current|current]] antinode, and a voltage antinode is a current node.

Nodes are the points of zero displacement, not the points where two constituent waves intersect.

== Boundary conditions ==
Where the nodes occur in relation to the boundary reflecting the waves depends on the end conditions or [[boundary conditions]].  Although there are many types of end conditions, the ends of resonators are usually one of two types that cause total reflection:

*&lt;u&gt;Fixed boundary&lt;/u&gt;: Examples of this type of boundary are the attachment point of a [[guitar]] string, the closed end of an open pipe like an [[organ pipe]] or a [[woodwind]] pipe, the periphery of a [[drumhead]], a [[transmission line]] with the end [[short circuit]]ed, or the mirrors at the ends of a [[laser cavity]].  In this type, the amplitude of the wave is forced to zero at the boundary, so there is a node at the boundary, and the other nodes occur at multiples of half a wavelength from it:

:: 0,&amp;nbsp; λ/2,&amp;nbsp; λ,&amp;nbsp; 3λ/2,&amp;nbsp; 2λ, ...

*&lt;u&gt;Free boundary&lt;/u&gt;: Examples of this type are an open-ended organ or woodwind pipe, the ends of the vibrating resonator bars in a [[xylophone]], [[glockenspiel]] or [[tuning fork]], the ends of an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]], or a transmission line with an open end.  In this type the [[derivative (calculus)|derivative]] (slope) of the wave's amplitude (in [[sound wave]]s the pressure, in electromagnetic waves the [[Electric current|current]]) is forced to zero at the boundary.  So there is an amplitude maximum (antinode) at the boundary, the first node occurs a quarter wavelength from the end, and the other nodes are at half wavelength intervals from there:

:: λ/4,&amp;nbsp; 3λ/4,&amp;nbsp; 5λ/4,&amp;nbsp; 7λ/4, ...

== Examples ==

=== Sound ===
A sound wave consists of alternating cycles of compression and expansion of the wave medium. During compression, the molecules of the medium are forced together, resulting in the increased pressure and density. During expansion the molecules are forced apart, resulting in the decreased pressure and density.

The number of nodes in a specified length is directly proportional to the frequency of the wave.

Occasionally on a guitar, violin, or other stringed instrument, nodes are used to create [[harmonic]]s. When the finger is placed on top of the string at a certain point, but does not push the string all the way down to the fretboard, a third node is created (in addition to the [[bridge (instrument)|bridge]] and [[nut (instrument)|nut]]) and a harmonic is sounded. During normal play when the frets are used, the harmonics are always present, although they are quieter.  With the artificial node method, the [[overtone]] is louder and the [[Fundamental frequency|fundamental]] tone is quieter. If the finger is placed at the midpoint of the string, the first overtone is heard, which is an octave above the fundamental note which would be played, had the harmonic not been sounded. When two additional nodes divide the string into thirds, this creates an octave and a perfect fifth (twelfth). When three additional nodes divide the string into quarters, this creates a double octave. When four additional nodes divide the string into fifths, this creates a double-octave and a major third (17th). The octave, major third and perfect fifth are the three notes present in a major chord.

The characteristic sound that allows the listener to identify a particular instrument is largely due to the relative magnitude of the harmonics created by the instrument.

=== Chemistry ===

In chemistry, [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] waves, or "[[atomic orbital|orbitals]]", are used to describe the wave-like properties of electrons. Many of these quantum waves have nodes and antinodes as well. The number and position of these nodes and antinodes give rise to many of the properties of an atom or [[covalent bond]]. [[Atomic orbital]]s are classified according to the number of radial and angular nodes, while [[molecular orbital]]s are classified according to bonding character. Molecular orbitals with an antinode between nuclei are very stable, and are known as "bonding orbitals" which strengthen the bond. In contrast, molecular orbitals with a node between nuclei will not be stable due to electrostatic repulsion and are known as "anti-bonding orbitals" which weaken the bond. Another such [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] concept is the [[particle in a box]] where the number of nodes of the wavefunction can help determine the quantum energy state&amp;mdash;zero nodes corresponds to the ground state, one node corresponds to the 1st excited state, etc. In general,&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Messiah]], 1966. ''Quantum Mechanics'' (Vol. I), English translation from French by G. M. Temmer. North Holland, John Wiley &amp; Sons. Cf. chpt. IV, section III. [https://archive.org/details/QuantumMechanicsVolumeI   online]  Ch 3  §12&lt;/ref&gt; ''If one arranges the eigenstates in the order of increasing energies, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1,\epsilon_2, \epsilon_3,...&lt;/math&gt;, the eigenfunctions likewise fall in the order of increasing number of nodes; the ''n''th eigenfunction has ''n−1'' nodes, between each of which the following eigenfunctions have at least one node''.

Their coordinate addresses are (1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0), (0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0), (0,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;0) and (0,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;1) respectively.  These may be scaled and linearly combined to span conventional ''XYZ'' space, with at least one of the four coordinates unneeded (set to zero) in any given quadrant.

The normalization scheme is somewhat unusual in keeping all coordinates non-negative.  Typical of coordinate systems of this type (a, a, a, a) is an identity vector and may be added to normalize a result.  To negate (1,0,0,0), write (&amp;minus;1,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0,&amp;nbsp;0) then add (1,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1) to get&amp;nbsp;(0,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1).

==Pedagogical significance==

A typical application might set the edges of the basis tetrahedron as unit, with the quadrays considered unit on some other scale.  The tetrahedron itself may also be defined as the unit of volume, although the infrastructure does not demand using this setting.

The four quadrays may be linearly combined to provide integer coordinates for the inverse tetrahedron (0,1,1,1), (1,0,1,1), (1,1,0,1), (1,1,1,0), and for the cube, octahedron, rhombic dodecahedron and cuboctahedron of volumes 3, 4, 6 and 20 respectively, given the starting tetrahedron of unit volume.

For example, given A, B, C, D as (1,0,0,0), (0,1,0,0), (0,0,1,0) and (0,0,0,1) respectively, the vertices of an octahedron with the same edge length and volume four would be A + B, A + C, A + D, B + C, B + D, C + D or all eight permutations of {1,1,0,0}.  The vertices of the volume 20 cuboctahedron are all 12 permutations of {2,1,1,0}.

[[File:Raúl Cordero.jpg|thumb|right|Raúl Cordero in 2008]]

'''Raúl Cordero''' (born 1971) is a Cuban born conceptual painter. First known as part of the 90s generation in [[Cuba]], when he started exhibiting his work mostly in [[Europe]] and the [[United States of America]]. Cordero represents through his work the "other Cuban art." Far from the standards of the Cuban Revolution art, and without falling into topics of other artists from in and out of the island, Cordero samples pretexts whimsically obtained from various referential origins (press, magazines, books, TV, photography and video) and shows us his work as a result of recycling, of a revival, creating a new reality that refers more to art than to any other apparent content.

His art education started in [[Havana]] (Academia San Alejandro and Instituto Superior de Diseño) and his influences mix an interest in conceptual American artists such as [[John Baldessari]], [[Bruce Nauman]] or [[Chris Burden]] -who later informed his conceptual training- together with elements of the 12th century's [[Flemish painting]] tradition, acquired during his postgraduate formation in the [[Netherlands]] (Graphic Media Development Centre and Rijksakademie Van Beeldende Kunsten). Cordero has held visiting professorships at the Instituto Superior de Arte (ISA) in Havana, Cuba; The [[San Francisco Art Institute]], [[California]] and [[The Art Academy of Cincinnati]], in [[Ohio]], U.S.A.

His work features in the collection of several museums such as [[Centre Georges Pompidou|Musée National D’Art Moderne Centre Pompidou]], [[Paris]], [[France]], [[Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes de La Habana]], Cuba, [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (LACMA), [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] (MOCA), California, Stedelijk Museum voor Actuele Kunst (SMAK). [[Ghent]], [[Belgium]], Centro Atlántico de Arte Moderno and Museo Extremeño Iberoamericano de Arte Contemporáneo (MEIAC), [[Spain]], [[Museum of Contemporary Art, San Diego]], California, U.S.A. The National Museum of Fine Arts in Havana is currently building a large exhibition of Cordero's work, which was scheduled to open in November 2017. Cordero is represented by Mai 36 Galerie in [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]].

'''Recognition-primed decision''' ('''RPD''') is a model of how people make quick, effective [[decision making|decision]]s when faced with complex situations. In this model, the decision maker is assumed to generate a possible course of action, compare it to the constraints imposed by the situation, and select the first course of action that is not rejected. RPD has been described in diverse groups including Whitewater kayaking Trauma nurses, fireground commanders, chess players, commercial Whitewater river guides and  stock market traders. It functions well in conditions of time pressure, and in which information is partial and goals poorly defined. The limitations of RPD include the need for extensive experience among decision-makers (in order to correctly recognize the salient features of a problem and model solutions) and the problem of the failure of recognition and modeling in unusual or misidentified circumstances. It appears{{to whom?|date=May 2017}} to be a valid model for how human decision-makers make decisions.

==Overview==
The RPD model identifies a reasonable reaction as the first one that is immediately considered. RPD combines two ways of developing a decision; the first is recognizing which course of action makes sense, and the second, evaluating the course of action through [[imagination]] to see if the actions resulting from that decision make sense. However, the difference of being experienced or inexperienced plays a major factor in the decision-making processes. 

RPD reveals a critical difference between experts and novices when presented with recurring situations. Experienced people will generally be able to come up with a quicker decision because the situation may match a prototypical situation they have encountered before. Novices, lacking this experience, must cycle through different possibilities, and tend to use the first course of action that they believe will work. The inexperienced also have the tendencies of using [[trial and error]] through their imagination.

==Variations==
There are three variations in RPD strategy. In Variation 1, decision makers recognize the situation as typical: a scenario where both the situational detail and the detail of relevant courses of action are known. Variation 1 is therefore essentially an “If… then…” reaction. A given situation will lead to an immediate course of action as a function of the situation's typicality. More experienced decision makers are more likely to have the knowledge of both prototypical situations and established courses of action that is required for an RPD strategy to qualify as Variation 1. 

Variation 2 occurs when the decision maker diagnoses an unknown situation to choose from a known selection of courses of action. Variation 2 takes the form of “If (???)… then…,” a phrase which implies the decision maker's specific knowledge of available courses of action but lack of knowledge regarding the parameters of the situation. In order to prevent situational complications and the accrual of misinformation, the decision maker models possible details of the situation carefully and then chooses the most relevant known course of action. Experienced decision makers are more likely to correctly model the situation, and are thus more likely to more quickly choose more appropriate courses of action.

In Variation 3, the decision maker is knowledgeable of the situation but unaware of the proper course of action. The decision maker therefore implements a mental trial and error simulation to develop the most effective course of action. Variation 3 takes the form of “If… then… (???)” wherein the decision maker models outcomes of new or uncommon courses of action. The decision maker will cycle through different courses of action until a course of action appears appropriate to the goals and priorities of the situation. Due to the time constraint fundamental to the RPD model, the decision maker will choose the first course of action which appears appropriate to the situation. Experienced decision makers are likely to develop a viable course of action more quickly because their expert knowledge can rapidly be used to disqualify inappropriate courses of action.

==Application==
Recognition primed decision making is highly relevant to the leaders or officers of organizations that are affiliated with emergency services such as fire fighters, search and rescue units, police, and other emergency services. It is applied to both the experienced and the inexperienced, and how they manage their decision making processes. The Recognition primed decision making model is developed as samples for organizations on how important decisions can affect important situations which may either save lives or take lives. The model developed can be used as a study for organizations to fill in the gaps and to determine which type of RPD variation is more applicable to the organization.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">In [[mathematical analysis]], the word '''''region''''' usually refers to a subset of &lt;math&gt;\R^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\C^n&lt;/math&gt; that is [[open set|open]] (in the standard [[Euclidean topology]]), [[connected set|connected]] and [[empty set|non-empty]]. A '''closed region''' is sometimes defined to be the [[closure (topology)|closure]] of a region.

Regions and closed regions are often used as domains of functions or differential equations.

According to Kreyszig,&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Kreyszig]] (1993) ''Advanced Engineering Mathematics'', 7th edition, p. 720, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], {{ISBN|0-471-55380-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:A region is a set consisting of a [[domain (mathematical analysis)|domain]] plus, perhaps, some or all of its boundary points. (The reader is warned that some authors use the term "region" for what we call a domain [following standard terminology], and others make no distinction between the two terms.)
According to Yue Kuen Kwok,
:An open connected set is called an ''open region'' or ''domain''. ...to an open region we may add none, some, or all its [[limit point]]s, and simply call the new set a ''region''.&lt;ref&gt;Yue Kuen Kwok (2002) ''Applied Complex Variables for Scientists and Engineers'', § 1.4 Some topological definitions, p 23, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-00462-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3812">'''Resource selection functions''' (RSFs) are a class of functions that are used in [[spatial ecology]] to assess which habitat characteristics are important to a specific population or species of animal, by assessing the a probability of that animal using a certain resource proportional to the availability of that resource in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyce|first=Mark S|last2=Vernier|first2=Pierre R|last3=Nielsen|first3=Scott E|last4=Schmiegelow|first4=Fiona K. A|date=2002-11-30|title=Evaluating resource selection functions|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304380002002004|journal=Ecological Modelling|volume=157|issue=2–3|pages=281–300|doi=10.1016/S0304-3800(02)00200-4|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.8823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modeling ==
Resource Selection Functions require two types of data: location information for the wildlife in question, and data on the resources available across the study area. Resources can include a broad range of environmental and geographical variables, including categorical variables such as land cover type, or continuous variables such as average rainfall over a given time period. A variety of methods are used for modeling RSFs, with [[logistic regression]] being commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rBXnBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Resource Selection by Animals: Statistical Design and Analysis for Field Studies|last=Manly|first=B.

RSFs can be fit to data where animal presence is known, but absence is not, such as for species where several individuals within a study area are fitted with a GPS collar, but some individuals may be present without collars.
When this is the case, buffers of various distances are generated around known presence points, with a number of available points generated within each buffer, which represent areas where the animal could have been, but it is unknown whether they actually were.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Chris J.|last2=Nielsen|first2=Scott E.|last3=Merrill|first3=Evelyn H.|last4=Mcdonald|first4=Trent L.|last5=Boyce|first5=Mark S.|date=2006-04-01|title=Resource Selection Functions Based on Use–Availability Data: Theoretical Motivation and Evaluation Methods|journal=Journal of Wildlife Management|volume=70|issue=2|pages=347–357|doi=10.2193/0022-541X(2006)70[347:RSFBOU]2.0.CO;2|issn=0022-541X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These models can be fit using binomial generalized linear models or binomial generalized linear mixed models, with the resources, or environmental and geographic data, as explanatory variables.

== Scale ==
Resource selection functions can be modeled at a variety of spatial scales, depending on the species and the scientific question being studied. (insert one more sentence on scale)

Most RSFs address one of the following scales, which were defined by Douglas Johnson in 1980 and are still used today:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Douglas H.|date=1980-02-01|title=The Comparison of Usage and Availability Measurements for Evaluating Resource Preference|journal=Ecology|language=en|volume=61|issue=1|pages=65–71|doi=10.2307/1937156|issn=1939-9170|jstor=1937156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''First order selection:''' The entire range of a species
* '''Second order selection:''' The home range of an individual or group of animals
* '''Third order selection:''' Resource or habitat usage within an individual's or group's home range

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4820">'''Respect for persons''' is the concept that all people deserve the right to fully exercise their [[autonomy]]. Showing respect for persons is a system for interaction in which one entity ensures that another has [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] to be able to make a [[choice]].

This concept is usually discussed in the context of [[research ethics]]. It is one of the three basic principles of research ethics stated in the [[Belmont Report]] issued by the Office of Human Subject Research; it comprises two essential moral requirements: to recognize the right for autonomy and to protect individuals who are disadvantaged to the extent that they cannot practice this right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research |location=[[Washington, DC]] |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |url=http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html#gob1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426013513/http://ohsr.od.nih.gov/guidelines/belmont.html |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An autonomous person is defined as an individual who is capable of self-legislation and is able to make judgments and actions based on his/her particular set of values, preferences, and beliefs. Respecting a person’s autonomy thus involves considering his/her choices and decisions without deliberate obstruction. It also requires that subjects be treated in a non-degrading manner out of respect for their dignity. In practice, respect for persons is operationalized by obtaining [[Informed Consent]] from all individuals who are going to be research subjects.

==Vulnerable populations==
The standard case for applying respect for persons is when the person receiving the health intervention is of sound mind, fit to make personal decisions, and empowered to choose from various options. Other cases involve showing respect to people who for whatever reason are not free to choose among the typical range of options when making a decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cook | first1 = D. | last2 = Moore-Cox | first2 = A. | last3 = Xavier | first3 = D. | last4 = Lauzier | first4 = F. | last5 = Roberts | first5 = I. | title = Randomized Trials in Vulnerable Populations | doi = 10.1177/1740774507087552 | journal = Clinical Trials | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–69 | year = 2008 | pmid =  18283082| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Robert J.|title=Ethics and regulation of clinical research|year=1988|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|isbn=978-0-300-04288-7|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medical research ethics, the term Vulnerable Populations generally refers to individuals whose situations do not allow them to protect their own interests. The categories of individuals that constitute Vulnerable Populations are outlined under The Common Rule (45 CFR 46, Subparts A-D). These include individuals who are minors, prisoners, pregnant, physically handicapped, mentally disabled, old, economically disadvantaged, educationally disadvantaged, or subordinates in hierarchical groups (e.g. a soldier).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruof|first=Mary, C.|title=Vulnerability, Vulnerable Populations, and Policy.|journal=Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal|year=2004|volume=4|issue=14|pages=411–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2. International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects, Council for International Organization of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) and World Health Organization (WHO) Geneva, Switzerland, 2002|url=http://www.cioms.ch/publications/layout_guide2002.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823205120/http://www.cioms.ch/publications/layout_guide2002.pdf|archivedate=2010-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These individuals are entitled to protection, and additional ethical justification is needed to involve such populations in human subject studies. In such cases, a balance should be established between protecting subjects from exploitation and depriving these subjects of access to the potential benefits of research.

Reasons justifying the participation of these subjects would include that some studies could not be carried out without a vulnerable population. Another justification would be that the aim of the study is to gain knowledge to improve diagnosis, prevention or treatment of diseases associated specifically with that population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruof|first=Mary, C.|title=Vulnerability, Vulnerable Populations, and Policy.|journal=Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal|year=2004|volume=4|issue=14|pages=411–425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Kambalu was born in Malawi, where he attended [[Kamuzu Academy]], the "Eton of Africa".&lt;ref&gt;[[Kamuzu Academy]]&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[University of Malawi]]'s Chancellor College, [[Zomba, Malawi|Zomba]] in 1999.  Kambalu completed his MA in Fine Art at [[Nottingham Trent University]] in 2003 and wrote his PhD at [[Chelsea College of Art and Design]], looking at how the problematic of the gift and the general economy animates various aspects of his art practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.arts.ac.uk/chelsea/2015/04/01/phd-student-samson-kambalu-to-exhibit-at-venice-2015/|title=PhD student Samson Kambalu to exhibit at Venice 2015 – Chelsea College of Arts Blog|website=blogs.arts.ac.uk|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Savage Worlds''''' is a generic [[role-playing game]] and [[Miniature wargaming|miniatures wargame]] written by [[Shane Lacy Hensley]] and published by [[Pinnacle Entertainment Group]]. The game emphasizes speed of play and reduced preparation over realism or detail. The game received the 2003 Origin Gamers' Choice Award for best role-playing game.&lt;ref name="OriginsAward"&gt;{{cite web |title=List of Winners Presented at Origins 2004 |publisher=[[Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts and Design]] |url=http://www.originsgames.com/awards/2003 |accessdate=2008-07-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430164136/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/2003|archivedate=2008-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Settings==
Although ''Savage Worlds'' is a generic rules system, Pinnacle has released "Savage Settings" - campaign settings or modules designed specifically for the ''Savage Worlds'' rules. These have included ''Evernight'', ''50 Fathoms'', ''Necessary Evil'', ''Rippers'', and ''Low Life''. Pinnacle has also published setting books based on the company's earlier lines, including ''[[Deadlands]]: Reloaded'' as well as the ''Tour of Darkness,'' ''Necropolis,'' and ''Weird War II'' settings based on the ''[[Weird Wars]]'' line.

Beginning with ''50 Fathoms'', the majority of settings released by Pinnacle feature a concept known as a "Plot Point Campaign". In such campaigns, a series of loosely defined adventure scenarios are presented. A main storyline is presented as a series of "Plot Points" and additional [[side-quests]] (or "Savage Tales") expand the scope of the campaign. This format allow a group of characters to explore the game universe while playing through (or disregarding) the main storyline in a manner similar to that of [[role-playing video game]]s.

A licensing system is in place for electronic and book publishers to release material for the ''Savage Worlds'' game. Such "Savaged!" licensees are allowed to use the ''Savage Worlds'' mascot "Smiling Jack" as a logo on their products. Multiple PDF adventure scenarios are available using this licensing system, as well as setting related supplements like the ''[[Vampire Earth]] RPG Sourcebook'' and the ''Shaintar Player's Guide''.

==System==

===Character creation===
Player characters are built using a point allocation system, though game masters are encouraged to design non-player characters to the needs of the game rather than to fit the system. Characters in ''Savage Worlds'' are composed of a variety of [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]]. These include [[Race (fantasy)|Race]], Traits, Edges, Hindrances and sometimes [[statistic (role-playing games)#Powers|Powers]].

====Race====
A character's race usually refers to his or her species, which may grant or impose modifiers to characteristics. In some settings (such as the [[Pirates Constructible Strategy Game|''Pirates of the Spanish Main'' RPG]]) this may instead refer to nationality, which typically does not. Nationality based differences may occur in campaigns where certain Skill specializations, Edges and Hindrances are affected by cultural or technological differences or are included to add flavor to a character. For instance, in ''Deadlands: Reloaded'' a non-Chinese character may learn Chinese Martial Arts but cannot acquire and use its Chi-based Powers. In ''Weird War II'' American, British, or French soldiers have special Edges and Hindrances to reflect their different national and military cultures.

====Traits (Attributes &amp; Skills)====
A character's traits are characteristics that are rated by a single polyhedral [[dice|die]]. The more sides the trait is rated in, the better the character is at the trait - ranging from a 4-sided die (d4 - the lowest) to a 12-sided die (d12 - the highest). So a character with a Strength trait of a ten-sided die (d10) is stronger than a character whose Strength trait is rated with a six-sided die (d6). Traits are divided into [[Attribute (role-playing games)|Attributes]], which are inherent, and [[statistic (role-playing games)#Skills|Skills]], which are learned.

The five Attributes used in ''Savage Worlds'' are Agility (Physical Precision and Speed), Smarts (Mental Power), Spirit (Willpower), Strength (Physical Power) and Vigor (Physical Health). Attributes start at Level 1 (d4) and cost one point per additional level; Level 1 (d4) in an Attribute would cost nothing and Level 5 (d12) would cost four points. The number of points assigned to spend on Attributes is usually 5 points, but can be more in certain gameworlds.

Attributes are also used to set the point cost of skills in that Attribute's group. The player can buy levels in a Skill at cost as long as its level is lower than its controlling Attribute. The point cost doubles if the Skill level exceeds the controlling Attribute. For instance, Healing is a Smarts-based skill. If a character had a Smarts of Level 1 (4-sided die, or d4) and wants to buy the Healing skill at Level 2 (six-sided die, or d6), it will cost 3 points - one point for Healing at Level 1 (d4) and two points for Healing at Level 2 (d6). If they had a Smarts of Level 2 (or d6) it would only have cost 2 points - one point for Level 1 (d4) and another for Level 2 (d6). The number of points assigned to spend on Skills is usually 15 points, but can be more in certain gameworlds.

In addition to Attributes a character has the following [[statistic (role-playing games)#Derived statistics|derived statistics]]: Pace (ground speed), Parry (the ability to defend one's self), Toughness (resistance to damage) and Charisma (presence and charm). Some setting supplements add a fifth derived statistic such as Reason (Problem Solving), Sanity (Mental Health) or Grit (Mental Strength) to reflect the special needs of the gameworld.

Like in the [[Fudge (role-playing game system)|FUDGE]] and [[Fate (role-playing game system)|FATE]] systems the skills are broad and allow the character to use them for a variety of related tasks. For instance, a character with Fighting would not just be skilled in fighting with their bare hands or with melee weapons. They might also be able to identify and counter an opponent's fighting style, know the name and reputation of a skilled fighter they meet, figure out the nationality and rank of a soldier by their uniform and insignia, or locate and hire a mercenary or bodyguard. Healing could be used to diagnose an illness, identify medicinal herbs or pharmaceutical drugs, find a healer or medical specialist, or prevent a disease outbreak in an encampment by organizing sanitation protocols.

====Edges and Hindrances====
Characters are also customized with [[statistic (role-playing games)#Advantages and disadvantages|advantages and disadvantages]] known as Edges and Hindrances. Edges and Hindrances, unlike Traits, are not rated with dice. Edges (character advantages) cost points, are based on their character Rank (Novice, Seasoned, Veteran, Heroic, or Legendary), and are unlocked as the character levels up. They are also grouped by Type, which may - depending on the campaign or world - affect their availability. Beginning Edges can only be granted at character creation. Social Edges affect interaction skills. Combat Edges affect the character's fighting skills and Leadership Edges affect group or massed combat. Professional Edges are related to the character's job or role and affects their career skills. Power, Weird, or Wild Card Edges are supernatural, paranormal, or superhuman advantages and grant bonuses to Powers; they may not be available in mundane game worlds. Hindrances (character disadvantages) grant points and are ranked as Minor (which grants a character point) or Major (which grants two character points).

====Powers====
Some gameworlds have the option of granting superhuman abilities to characters -usually with a magical, mystical, technological, [[Psychic|psionic]], racial, or mutant origin. They are ranked like Edges (Novice, Seasoned, Veteran, Heroic, or Legendary) and can be expanded by leveling up.

===Task resolution===
Dice are rolled to determine the outcome of character actions and interactions in the game. Usually a trait die is rolled against a target number of four. If the roll equals or exceeds the target number, the action succeeds; otherwise it fails.

If a player rolls the highest number possible on a given die (such as an 8 on an eight-sided die), the die may be re-rolled and its result added to the initial roll. This is known as "Acing". A die may continue to Ace as long as the highest die number is rolled.

Player characters and significant non-player characters are known as "Wild Cards". Wild Cards get to roll a second die, known as a "Wild Die", alongside their trait rolls. This roll may Ace as normal. The player of the Wild Card uses the higher of the two rolls (trait die or Wild Die) to determine the actual result of the roll. In addition Wild Cards also receive a number of Bennies (Slang for benefits, also called poker chips in Dead Lands) per session. These can be traded in to reduce or negate damage from a given attack, or to reroll a trait die, and are used as rewards for good play.

Combat initiative is determined by a standard deck of playing cards (with two jokers); characters act in sequence according to the fall of the cards from highest to lowest. Ties are broken by suit (in order from best to worst, spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs). Jokers beat all other cards and additionally give bonuses on rolls made in the round one receives them. The deck is shuffled at the end of every round in which a joker was dealt.

Any player that receives a Joker during initiative may take his action at any time during the round.  So if he wishes to act first, or in response to another PC or NPC acting he may at any point.

==History==
In 1997, Pinnacle published ''Deadlands: the Great Rail Wars'', a [[Miniature_wargaming|miniature wargame]] set in the "Weird West" world of Hensley's  [[Deadlands]] role-playing game. The rules were a greatly simplified version of the full ''Deadlands'' system, focused on single-figure skirmishes. In 2003 the rules from ''The Great Rail Wars'' were revised and expanded into a generic, simple but complete role-playing system and retitled ''Savage Worlds''. At [[Origins International Game Expo|Origins]] 2003, ''Savage Worlds'' was awarded the Gamer's Choice Award in the Roleplaying Game category.&lt;ref name="OriginsAward"/&gt; The main rulebook was revised and released as a [[PDF]] format eBook in late 2004, with a print version following in early 2005. The same year, Great White Games began releasing rules expansions in the form of several PDF format genre toolkit books. Self-contained miniature skirmish games based upon the ''Savage Worlds'' engine were also released in print and PDF form.

''[[Deadlands]] Reloaded'', a version of the classic Pinnacle game using the ''Savage Worlds'' rules, was released in May 2006. In late 2005, Pinnacle entered into an agreement with [[WizKids]] to publish self-contained RPGs set in the worlds of ''[[Pirates of the Spanish Main|Pirates]]'', ''[[Rocketmen]]'', and ''[[MageKnight]]'' using the ''Savage Worlds'' rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wizkidsgames.com/wk_article.asp?cid=40452&amp;frame=company|title=Pinnacle Entertainment Group to Produce WizKids RPGs, Scenario Books|date=2005-11-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081125231523/http://www.wizkidsgames.com/wk_article.asp?cid=40452&amp;frame=company|archivedate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the three licenses, only ''The Pirates of the Spanish Main RPG'' saw release, and was published in April 2007. Pinnacle released another licensed game, ''The Savage World of [[Solomon Kane]]'', in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peginc.com/Press/SK_Announce_Aug082006.pdf|format=pdf|title=The Savage World of Solomon Kane to be an RPG|publisher=Greta Pinnacle Entertainment|date=2006-08-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927132245/http://www.peginc.com/Press/SK_Announce_Aug082006.pdf|archivedate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Pinnacle released the ''Savage Worlds Explorer's Edition'', a [[digest size]] [[paperback]] edition of the rules. It featured the revisions to melee damage rules first introduced in ''Deadlands Reloaded'', as well as new chase rules, and was released at Origins 2007. At that event, ''Deadlands Reloaded'' won the [[Origins Award]] in the category of Best Roleplaying Game Supplement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peginc.com/Press/DL_OriginsWin_July102007.pdf Deadlands: Reloaded Wins Origins Award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927132239/http://www.peginc.com/Press/DL_OriginsWin_July102007.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, Pinnacle released ''Savage Worlds Deluxe'', a hardcover and expanded version of the rules found in the Explorer's Edition.

In August 2012, Pinnacle released the digest size paperback edition of the Deluxe rules, ''Savage Worlds Deluxe Explorer's Edition''.

In 2015 Pinnacle announced a series of supplements converting [[Rifts (role-playing game)|''Rifts'']] to the Savage Worlds system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.peginc.com/rifts-is-coming-for-savage-worlds/| title= Rifts is Coming for Savage Worlds!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 Pinnacle announced a new edition: Savage Worlds Adventure Edition (#SWADE). &lt;ref&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/ref&gt; funded in six minutes.

'''Shram Suvidha''' is a Web Portal to provide a single platform for all labour compliances.

[[India]] has more than 40 labour laws regulated by the[[Ministry of Labour and Employment (India)| Ministry of Labour and Employment]], the [[Government of India]] and State Government. Compliance with these laws is tedious and time-consuming. As a result, employers often do not comply. The scale of noncompliance exceeds the ability of enforcement agencies to regulate. Amidst the confusion, employees do not always receive what they are entitled to under these laws. 

==Objectives==
The primary objectives of Shram Suvidha are:

* A unified portal for all compliance pertaining to Chief Labour Commissioner of India, Director General Mines and Safety, Employee State Insurance Corporation, and Employee Provident Fund Organization. There are 16 laws that are covered here like Payment of Wages Act, [[Minimum Wages Act 1948|Minimum Wages Act]], Contract Labour (Abolition and Regulation) Act.
* Creation of a unique number known as the Labour Identification Number or LIN to supplement all other registration numbers such as PF Establishment Code, [[ESIC]] Registration Number, Contract Labour Registration Number, etc.
* Online servicing of notices from the labour department and online submission of answers with document.
* Employee grievances can now be received online and employer has to clear them and submit proof of clearance.

==Process==
Shram Suvidha allows an organization to know what labour laws apply to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shramsamadhan.com/p/shram-suvidha-compliances-explanations.html|title=Shram Suvidha Compliances &amp; Explanations|website=Shramsamadhan.com|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://shramsuvidha.gov.in/home.action|title=Shram Suvidha : (One-Stop-Shop for Labour Law Compliance)|website=Shramsuvidha.gov.in|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compliances are reportable in a single form that makes it simple for those filing such forms. Performance is monitored using key indicators thus making the evaluation process objective. It promotes the use of a common Labour Identification Number (LIN) by all Implementing agencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20581">[[Image:Maxschelerphoto.jpg|thumb|Max Scheler (1874–1928)]]
[[Max Scheler]] (1874–1928) was an early 20th-century German Continental philosopher in the phenomenological tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Max Scheler, Selected Philosophical Essays. Trans. David R. Lachterman. “The Idols of Self-Knowledge,” “Ordo Amoris,” “Phenomenology and the Theory of Cognition,” “The Theory of Three Facts,” and “Idealism and Realism” (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973) editor’s introduction, pp. xi-xiv.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scheler's style of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] has been described by some scholars as “applied phenomenology”: an appeal to facts or “things in themselves” as always furnishing a descriptive basis for speculative philosophical concepts. One key source of just such a pattern of facts is expressed in Scheler’s descriptive mapping of human emotional life (the “Stratification of Emotional Life”) as articulated in his seminal 1913–1916 work, Formalism in Ethics and Non-Formal Ethics of Values.&lt;ref&gt;Manfred S. Frings, Max Scheler: A Concise Introduction into the World of a Great Thinker (Milwaukee: Marquette University Press, 1996), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
{{Original research|date=January 2009}}
The practical significance of Scheler's Stratification of Emotional Life is obvious in several respects and points of view.

First, Scheler seems to be making a case in favor of what we might refer to today as [[Emotional Intelligence]], as a portal to more ethical behavior and optimum personal development, similar to the ancient Greek concern for promoting virtuous character.&lt;ref&gt;Max Scheler “Ordo Amoris”, in Selected Philosophical Essays, trans. David R. Lachterman (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), pp. 103-104. See also Plato’s Republic (the Soul).&lt;/ref&gt;  However quite unlike many of our modern attitudes and prejudices, emotional life ought '''''not''''' be viewed as simply a chaotic impediment to reason, but rather should be understood as a sort of “sixth sense” having an informative objective core: what Scheler termed our ''Ordo Amoris'' (or “Logic of the Heart”).&lt;ref&gt;“Ordo Amoris”, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, for Scheler values have true primacy as real inherent ''qualities'' discovered in things, people, situations and the like. Values and immanent emotive experience are co-extensive: “the plain fact is that we act vis-à-vis values just as we do vis-à-vis colors and sounds.” &lt;ref&gt;Max Scheler, Formalism in Ethics and Non-Formal Ethics of Values, trans. Manfred S. Frings and Richard L. Funk (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; Scheler's claim is that the correlates of feelings and emotions are ''values'', just as the correlates of visual perception are ''colors'' and audio perceptions are ''sounds''. If such qualities are present in a person's world, they tend to be apprehended. But the reverse is also true: the meanings ascribed to things, people, situations and the like are uniquely co-extensive with the subjective relativity of every ''person'', as the "totality of acts of different kinds" &lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; having a unique qualitative direction &lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; and destiny.&lt;ref&gt;"Ordo Amoris", p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; As a value being and bearer of values every person is as unique as a snowflake. This is why Scheler's ethics is commonly referred as a [[Material Value-Ethics]] as opposed to a formal ethics ([[Immanuel Kant]]).

Third, values are emotively intuited. The ''whole'' of "something" is intuited by consciousness before any of the ''parts'' can fully be rationally known or assimilated. Common expressions such as "ah ha", "love at first sight," ''déjà vu'' or "the cat's pajamas" sum up this basic idea. Values are realized though personal apprehensions (i.e. "attractions" and "repulsions") of positive (and negative) qualities discoverable through our own pre-thought, pre-willed acts of ''preference''.&lt;ref&gt;Max Scheler, The Nature of Sympathy, trans. Peter Heath (Hamden: Shoe Sting Press, 1973), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth, depth of emotion signals importance (intensity) of value, just as absence of feeling signals the lack. This depth structure found in emotive life correlates reciprocally to Scheler’s formulation of an upward vertical ''apriori'' hierarchy of values as forming the basis of an intuitive ethics inspired by love,&lt;ref&gt;Sympathy, p. 157 &amp; 161.  For Scheler, the introduction of Christian Love in history validated loving those perceived as “lower” in stature than oneself, (i.e., the needy, the affirmed, the socially exploited and rejected, the different) in contrast to the classical Greek and Roman love which focused only what is higher or more powerful. With Christian love, our aiming higher leads to God which in turn leads to compassion and acceptance toward others and the world unlike ourselves as a work in progress, struggling and less than perfect, but beautiful and valued nonetheless.  See also “Frings” pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt; emanating ultimately from the ''Divine''.&lt;ref&gt;Sympathy, Chapter 11; “Ordo Amoris”, pp. 105-108; Formalism, p. 294. Also see Max Scheler, On the Eternal in Man.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scheler's analysis of the strata of emotive life ==
For Scheler, human feelings, feeling states and emotions display a meaningful and progressive pattern of levels from our peripheral to the deeper more stable structures of personality.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p. 336.
&lt;/ref&gt; Scheler identified four &lt;ref&gt;Some Scholars focusing on Scheler’s later writings have come to posit a fifth value modality, values of utility, located between sensible and vital values.  This is a debatable point as many scholars believe that Scheler never retraced his early formulations on the emotions and values. Also, in his early works Scheler did not identify a distinct class of feelings, feeling states or emotions associated with utility. In fact, Scheler maintained that the values of the useful always served values of the agreeable (Formalism., p. 94). Utility may very well better be interpreted and assimilated as a highly developed dimension of Vital Urge.
&lt;/ref&gt; distinct but interrelated strata found in human emotional life.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;

At our most periphery we have '''sensible feelings''' (e.g., a tickle, an itch, a fragrance, a taste, pleasure, pain, hunger, thirst, intoxication…), which manifest in relative modes of joy and suffering.  These feelings are shortest in duration, extended and localizable with reference to the lived-body, and are the most readily alterable and accessible through external means and stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, pp. 333-338.&lt;/ref&gt;

Next we have '''vital feelings''' or feeling states of the unitary lived-body which are experienced as a unified field or whole (e.g., comfort, health, vigor, strength, tiredness, illness, weakness, advancing age, [[phantom limb]] phenomenon…), and which manifest intentionally as fear and hope.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, pp. 338-342 &amp; 335. Fear as a negative vital influence has the usual effect of blocking higher thought processes of the psychic level.&lt;/ref&gt;

The remaining two strata of the emotive map belongs to the realm of individual personhood because these emotions transcend (or at least exceed) the physical restrictions of lived-body and environment; they are the least subject to arbitrary alteration; and they are also by their very nature communicable and social in character.

These are, first, the purely '''psychic feeling states''' or emotions having a characteristically ego-quality (e.g., euphoria, happiness, sympathy, enjoyment, sadness, sorrow, anger, jealousy…), and which manifest intentionally as empathy, preferring, loving, hating and willing.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p. 342 &amp; 336.&lt;/ref&gt; As representing one’s prevalent mental disposition it is important to note that psychic feeling states are alterable though acts of free will, thought and positive social interactions.

Finally, Scheler identifies '''spiritual feelings''' which differ sharply from personal psychic feeling states in that “all ego-states seem to be extinguished… [and such emotions] take possession of the whole of our being.”&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., bliss, awe, wonder, catharsis, despair, shame, remorse, anxiety, pangs of conscience, grief…). These types of emotions overtake and overcome us, usually quite unexpectedly.  We can not reason or will to produce such spiritual feelings.  As positive experiences, we can only open our hearts and mind and hope that they find us.

The intentional arch of positive feelings and feeling states ultimately spans from the sensible to the spiritual, or from a sort of “hedonistic nihilism” to deeper levels of personal contentment.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p. 331.  Also, see Formalism, Part II, Chapter 9 (b) “All Volitional Direction toward the Realization of Positive and Comparatively Higher Values Originally Arise from Positive Feeling-States and Sources." Note, that all experience of positive feelings and felling states always inherently point and inform directionally toward yet higher values with their attendant feelings and feeling states.  All positive feelings and feeling states precipitate awareness of yet higher value and feeling strata. Positive spiritual feelings particularly can serve a function of returning the person back onto their world with renewed perspective and energy.&lt;/ref&gt; The opposite is true for negative feeling and feeling states.&lt;ref&gt;Max Scheler, Ressentiment, trans. William H. Holdheim (New York: Noonday, 1973), pp. 23-26.  Also, see Formalism, Part II, and Chapter 9 (a) "The Law of the Tendency toward Surrogates When a “Deeper” Emotional Determination of the Ego Is Negative." When personal progress becomes stagnant or frustrated in moving from a negative to a more positive plateau given a relatively high vital or psychic level of value attainment, there is an inherent tendency toward regression in terms of indulgence in traditional vices. This tendency might be termed as the transcendable (self-medicating) condition of mans "inherent moral weakness." In its extreme form this tendency can lend itself toward '''ressentiment'''. In literature this tendency is akin to the concept of "[[tragic flaw]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

== The connection between emotive life and value modalities ==
The structure of Scheler's stratification model of emotive life correlates to the inherent spectral type structure of value rankings, or what Scheler termed the  '''''apriori'' hierarchy of value modalities'''.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, Part I, Chapter 2, Section 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Our earlier analogy to color perception illustrates this point. Just as all colors we intuit (see) are derivative of the pure spectrum or hues as when pure ("white") light is refracted through a prism, so too all intuited (felt) values are derivative of the '''''apriori'' hierarchy of value modalities''' as when ''Divine'' love is apprehended through a purely ordered heart ('''''Ordo Amoris''''').

Scheler's claim is that these value modalities are  constant and unchanging throughout history, forming a basis for objective non-formal ethics.  From lowest to highest these modalities (with their respective positive and corresponding negative dis-value forms) are as follows: '''''sensual values''''' of the '''agreeable''' and the '''disagreeable'''; '''''vital values''''' of the '''noble''' and '''vulgar'''; '''''mental (psychic) values''''' of the '''beautiful''' and '''ugly''', '''right''' and '''wrong''' and '''truth''' and '''falsehood'''; and finally '''''values of the Holy and Unholy''''' of the '''Divine''' and '''Idols'''.&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, Part I, Chapter 2-B (5) “A Priori Relations of Rank among Value-Modalities".&lt;/ref&gt;

                       
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Values hiearchy.jpg|Click on to Enlarge
Image:Emotion value correlation.jpg|Click on to Enlarge
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The [[logical consequence|logical implication]] of all the above is that human beings will naturally prefer a positive value (i.e., value situation) over a negative value (or dis-value), such as when life seems to tragically descend in a self-perpetuating spiral of negative emotions (envy, anger, jealousy, spite, hate, revenge)--a psycho-philosophical problematic termed '''''[[Ressentiment]]'''''. Furthermore, human beings will naturally prefer values of a higher ranking over those of a lower to the extent that they will invest time, work and sacrifice to order to attain them: for example, people will routinely defer a measure of immediate gratification in order to secure a child's education, their own retirement, etc.

Hence, the relativity of value experience transitions to the beginnings of an objective morality which ensures personal fulfillment and transcendence. Since all ethics must ultimately advise our decisions in some way, Scheler’s non-formal value-based ethics promises to potentially achieve this end through our cognitive understanding and channeling of the advance information offered through our emotive life.

== Philosophy vs. psychology: a relation of synergy ==
Critics and admirers alike find Scheler's ethics susceptible to flights of romanticism as "decisively canceling the normative character of ethical acts." &lt;ref&gt;Rocco Buttiglione, Karol Wojtyla: The Thought of the Man who Became Pope John Paul II, trans. Paolo Guietti, Francesca Murphy (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1997). pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt; No surprise since a non-formal ethics does not rely on a system of rules or principles, but only implicit suggestions.&lt;ref&gt;Scheler maintained that two events insure the restoration of a rightly ordered  heart '''''Ordo Amoris''''': (a) the appearance of model persons ("role models"), and (b) natural mystic religious experience.&lt;/ref&gt;  More pragmatic applications of Scheler's principles might best be implemented under the controlled guidance of therapeutic psychology.

Scheler’s ideas are inspiring to anyone who shares a common philosophical belief in the fundamental value of persons and in developing each of us to our optimum potential. This is all the more true when we consider just what this might mean for a well-ordered free and democratic society.

However, extreme care should be taken not to assume Scheler’s philosophy is somehow based purely in some sort of progressive bottom-up psychology: for example, Abraham [[Maslow’s hierarchy of needs]], Jean Piaget’s [[theory of cognitive development]], or Lawrence Kohlberg’s [[Stages of Moral Development]].  This is particularly important since Scheler’s relied extensively on hierarchical “stratification” models as a sort of general motif&lt;ref&gt;Hierarchy of Model Person Types from lowest to highest: the Bon Vivant, the Hero, the Genius and the Saint. (See Formalism, p. 585). Hierarchy of Essential Forms of Human Togetherness from lowest to highest: the Herd, the Family &amp; Live-Community, the Society, and the Collective Persons of Church and Nation. Hierarchy of Spheres of Consciousness (Forms of Cognition or Knowing) from lowest to highest: the Inanimate, the Animate, I-Thou and the Absolute.&lt;/ref&gt; for his philosophy as a whole, as well as for a wide range of editorial topics.  In spite many striking content similarities with scientific psychological theories, Scheler’s philosophy is, by contrast, first and foremost a serviceable speculative top-down emanation model,&lt;ref&gt;Formalism, p 94.&lt;/ref&gt; guided by love and values, and based upon dualistic metaphysical principals &lt;ref&gt;Arthur R. Luther, “The Articulated Unity of Being in Scheler’s Phenomenology. Basic Drive and Spirit,” in Max Scheler (1874-1928) Centennial Essays, ed. Manfred S. Frings (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1974), pp 1-42.  See also Max Scheler, Man’s Place in Nature.  Also see “Frings”, Chapter 2 “On the Bio-Psychic World.”  For Scheler, Spirit is manifest infinitely as the Divine Essence, or God (depending upon your religious orientation); and finitely as persons and collectively as the nation and church.  Persons are the juncture point and locus between drives (Vital Urge) and Spirit.&lt;/ref&gt; of '''Vital Urge''' (''Drang'')&lt;ref&gt;"Frings", p 11. "...the lowest stratum of psychic being is the presence of an unspecified, undifferentiated, blind "''urge forward''" (''Drang''). It is completely conscious-less and, therefore without inner or outer sensation. This urge reveals itself as a slow "towards" and "away from" (e.g. towards light) and it must first be attributed to plant life. It is at the same time the "vapor" (''Dampf''), which is at the bottom of all life, driving forward all life up to its highest manifestations."&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Spirit''' (''Geist'').&lt;ref&gt;"Frings, pp 15-17. "...the essential difference between animal and man is the presence of ''Spirit'' (''Geist''), which makes human life highly independent of drives, and independent of  attachment to environment (in contrast to the basically environment-stricken animal).... This is clear when we consider that man forms his own environment in social life and history as well as in using artificial means to change it for better adjustment and comfort.... Spirit elevates man above world and above himself (as organic being).... Spirit, then, cannot have its foundation or source in this objective world, but only in the primordial principal of the cosmos (''Urgrund'') itself."&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, science alone can not fully account the sustaining spiritual forces that lift man and culture beyond the limitations of practical necessity, adaptation and natural selection. When scientific method can no longer design a model to verify what the scientist suspects, he becomes a philosopher of sorts...that is when the scientific community considers that member to have gone "soft in the head"—a distinction which ironically includes most of the best and brightest of science.

'''Structural violence''' is a term commonly ascribed to [[Johan Galtung]], which he introduced in the article "Violence, Peace, and Peace Research" (1969).&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan. "Violence, Peace, and Peace Research" ''[[Journal of Peace Research]]'', Vol. 6, No. 3 (1969), pp. 167–191&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a form of violence wherein some [[social structure]] or [[social institution]] may harm people by preventing them from meeting their basic needs. Institutionalized [[Adultism#Institutional adultism|adultism]], [[ageism]], [[classism]], [[elitism]], [[ethnocentrism]], [[nationalism]], [[speciesism]], [[racism]], and [[sexism]] are some examples of structural violence as proposed by Galtung.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.galtung-institut.de/en/home/johan-galtung/ Johan Galtung]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iais.org.my/e/index.php/events-sp-1744003054/past-events/517-public-lecture-seeking-peace-from-resolving-conflict-between-buddhists-and-muslims-in-myanmar-and-sri-lanka-by-prof-dr-johan-galtung.html "Seeking Peace from Resolving Conflict between Buddhists and Muslims in Myanmar and Sri Lanka" by Prof. Dr. Johan Galtung]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Galtung, rather than conveying a physical image, structural violence is an "avoidable impairment of fundamental human needs".&lt;ref&gt;Johan Galtung, "Kulturelle Gewalt" (1993) Vol. 43 ''Der Burger im Staat'' p. 106 in Ho, Kathleen "Structural Violence as a Human Rights Violation" (2007). ''Essex Human Rights Review'' Vol. 4 No. 2 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As it is avoidable, structural violence is a high cause of premature death and unnecessary disability. Because structural violence affects people differently in various social structures, it is very closely linked to social injustice.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Structural violence and direct violence are said to be highly interdependent, including [[domestic violence|family violence]], [[sexual violence|gender violence]], [[hate crime]]s, [[racial violence]], [[police violence]], [[state violence]], [[terrorism]], and [[war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1 = James |last1 = Gilligan |authorlink = James Gilligan |year = 1997 |title = Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic |location =  |publisher = [[Vintage Books]] |isbn = 978-0679779124 |quote = Structural violence is ... the main cause of behavioral violence on a socially and epidemiologically significant scale (from homicide and suicide to war and genocide). The question as to which of the two forms of violence—structural or behavioral—is more important, dangerous, or lethal is moot, for they are inextricably related to each other, as cause to effect. |page = 196 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic'', [[James Gilligan]] defines structural violence as "the increased rates of death and disability suffered by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted with the relatively lower death rates experienced by those who are above them". Gilligan largely describes these "excess deaths" as "non-natural" and attributes them to the stress, shame, [[discrimination]], and denigration that results from lower status. He draws on Sennett and Cobb, who examine the "contest for dignity" in a context of dramatic [[social inequality|inequality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilligan|first1=James|title=Violence: Reflections on a National Epidemic|date=1996|publisher=First Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0-679-77912-4|edition=second}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bandy X Lee wrote in her article ''Causes and cures VII: Structural violence,'' "It refers to the avoidable limitations society places on groups of people that constrain them from achieving the quality of life that would have otherwise been possible. These limitations could be political, economic, religious, cultural, or legal in nature and usually originate in institutions that have authority over particular subjects."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aggression and Violent Behavior|last=|first=|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=109–114|quote=|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to say that it "directly illustrates a power system wherein social structures or institutions cause harm to people in a way that results in maldevelopment or deprivation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rather than the term being called social injustice or oppression, there is an advocacy for it to be called violence because this phenomenon comes from, and can be corrected by human decisions, rather than just natural causes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cause and effects ==
In ''The Sources of Social Power'',&amp;nbsp;Michael Mann makes the argument that within state formation, "increased organizational power is a trade-off, whereby the individual obtains more security and food in exchange for his or her freedom."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=How Old is Human Brutality?: On the Structural Origins of Violence|journal=Common Knowledge|volume=22|issue=1|last=Malešević|first=Siniša|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=81–104|quote=|via=Academic Search Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Siniša&amp;nbsp;Malešević&amp;nbsp;elaborates on Mann's argument by saying, "Mann's point needs extending to cover all social organizations, not just the state. The early chiefdoms were not states, obviously; still, they were established on a similar basis—an inversely proportional relationship between security and resources, on the one hand, and liberty, on the other."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This means that although those who live in organized, centralized social systems are not likely subject to hunger or to die in an animal attack, they are likely to engage in organized violence, which could include war. These structures make for opportunities and advances that humans could not create for themselves, including the development of agriculture, technology, philosophy, science, and art; however, these structures take tolls elsewhere, meaning that these structures are both productive and detrimental. In our early history, hunter-gather groups used organizational power to acquire more resources and produce more food, but at the same time, this power was also used to dominate, kill, and enslave other groups in order to expand territory and supplies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although structural violence is said to be invisible, it has a number of influences which shape it. These include identifiable institutions, relationships, force fields, and ideologies, including discriminatory laws, gender inequality, and racism.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chopra|first=Anayika|year=2014|title=Structural Violence|url=|journal=International Journal of Multidisciplinary Approach &amp; Studies|volume=1| issue =  4|pages=19–23|via=Academic Search Premier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this does not only exist for those of the lower class, although the effects are much heavier on them, including the highest rate of disease and death, unemployment, homelessness, lack of education, powerlessness, and shared fate of miseries. The whole social order is effected by social power, but these other groups have much more indirect effects on them, with the acts generally being less violent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Due to the social and economic structure in place today, specifically the division into rich and poor, powerful and weak, and superior and inferior, the death rate is between 10 and 20 million per year, which is about ten times the death rates from suicide, homicide, and warfare combined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cultural violence==
"Cultural violence" refers to aspects of a culture that can be used to justify or legitimize direct or structural violence, and may be exemplified by religion and ideology, language and art, empirical science and formal science.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung, Johan. "Cultural Violence," ''Journal of Peace Research'', Vol. 27, No. 3 (Aug., 1990), pp. 291–305&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural violence makes direct and structural violence look or feel "right", or at least not wrong, according to Galtung.&lt;ref&gt;Galtung 1990, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; The study of cultural violence highlights the ways the act of direct violence and the fact of structural violence are legitimized and thus made acceptable in society. One mechanism of cultural violence is to change the "moral color" of an act from "red/wrong" to "green/right", or at least to "yellow/acceptable".&lt;ref&gt;Galtung 1990, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

==International scope==
{{see also|Structural violence in Haiti}}
[[Petra Kelly]] wrote in her first book, ''Fighting for Hope'' (1984):

{{quote|A third of the 2 Billion people in the [[developing countries]] are [[starving]] or suffering from [[malnutrition]]. Twenty-five percent of their children die before their fifth birthday […] Less than 10 per cent of the 15 million children who died this year had been [[vaccinated]] against the six most common and dangerous [[Childhood disease|children's diseases]]. Vaccination costs £3 per child. But not doing so costs us five million lives a year. These are classic examples of ''structural violence''.}}

The violence in structural violence is attributed to the specific organizations of society that injure or harm individuals or masses of individuals. In explaining his point of view on how structural violence affects the health of subaltern or marginalized people, [[medical anthropologist]] [[Paul Farmer]] writes:

{{quote|Their sickness is a result of structural violence: neither culture nor pure individual will is at fault; rather, historically given (and often economically driven) processes and forces conspire to constrain individual agency. Structural violence is visited upon all those whose social status denies them access to the fruits of scientific and social progress.}}

This perspective has been continually discussed by [[Paul Farmer]], as well as by [[Philippe Bourgois]] and [[Nancy Scheper-Hughes]].

Theorists argue that structural violence is embedded in the current world system; this form of violence, which is centered on apparently inequitable social arrangements, is not inevitable. Ending the global problem of structural violence will require actions that may seem unfeasible in the short term. To some,{{who|date=June 2015}} this indicates that it may be easier to devote resources to minimizing the harmful impacts of structural violence. Others, such as futurist Wendell Bell, see a need for long-term vision to guide projects for social justice. Many structural violences, such as [[racism]] and [[sexism]], have become such a common occurrence in society that they appear almost invisible. Despite this fact, sexism and racism have been the focus of intense cultural and political resistance for many decades. Significant reform has been accomplished, though the project remains incomplete.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Paul Farmer notes that there are three reasons why structural violence is hard to see. 

1. Suffering is exoticized--that is, when something/someone is distant or far away, individuals tend to not be affected by it. When suffering lacks proximity, it's easy to exoticise. 
2. The weight of suffering is also impossible to comprehend. There is simply no way that many individuals are able to comprehend what suffering is like. 
3. Lastly, the dynamics and distribution of suffering are still poorly understood. &lt;ref&gt;Women, Poverty &amp; AIDS: Sex, Drugs and Structural Violence (Series in Health and Social Justice), with coauthor Margaret Connors, Common Courage Press; Reprint edition (September 1996), {{ISBN|978-1-56751-074-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to health care===
Structural violence affects the availability of [[health care]] in the sense that physicians often need to pay attention to broad social forces (racism, gender inequality, classism, etc.) to determine who falls ill and who will be given access to care. It is more likely for structural violence to occur in areas where biosocial methods are neglected in a country's health care system. Since structurally violent situations are viewed primarily as biological consequences, it neglects environmentally stimulated problems, such as negative social behaviours or inequality prominence. If biosocial understandings are forsaken when considering [[discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|communicable diseases such as HIV]], for example, prevention methods and treatment practices become inadequate and unsustainable for populations. However, the challenge is obvious: many countries cannot afford to stop the harmful cycle of structural violence.&lt;ref name="PLoS"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Farmer |first = Paul E. |authorlink = Paul Farmer |author2 = Nizeye Bruce |author3 = Stulac Sara |author4 = Keshavjee Salmaan |date = October 24, 2006 |title = Structural Violence and Clinical Medicine |journal = [[PLoS Medicine]] |volume = 3 |issue = 10 |pages = 1686–1691 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0030449 |url = http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0030449 |pmid = 17076568 |pmc = 1621099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Farmer argues that the major flaw in the dominant model of medical care is that medical services are sold as a [[commodity]], remaining only available to those who can afford them.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; The concept of structural violence is used to show how medical professionals are not trained to understand the social forces behind disease, nor are they trained to deal with or alter them. Medical professionals have to ignore the social determinants that alter access to care, and as a result, medical interventions are significantly less effective in low-income countries.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Structural violence is an issue not only in developing countries, but also in North America. For example, it has had a significant impact on diagnosis and treatment of AIDS in the United States. A 1990 study by Moore et al. found that blacks had a significantly lesser chance of receiving treatment than whites.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt;  Findings from another study suggest that the increased rate of workplace injury among undocumented Latino immigrants in the United States can be understood as an example of structural violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flynn|first=Michael A.|last2=Eggerth|first2=Donald E.|last3=Jacobson|first3=C. Jeffrey|date=2015-09-01|title=Undocumented status as a social determinant of occupational safety and health: The workers’ perspective|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281671993_Undocumented_status_as_a_social_determinant_of_occupational_safety_and_health_The_workers%2527_perspective|journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|volume=58|issue=11|pages=1127–1137|doi=10.1002/ajim.22531|issn=1097-0274|pmc=4632487|pmid=26471878}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Structural violence is the result of policy and [[social structure]]s, and change can only be a product of altering the processes that encourage structural violence in the first place. Paul Farmer claims that "structural interventions" are one possible solution.

Countries such as Haiti and Rwanda have implemented these interventions with positive outcomes. Examples include prohibiting the [[commodification]] of the citizen needs, such as health care, ensuring equitable access to effective therapies, and developing social safety nets. These initiatives increase citizen's [[economic, social and cultural rights|social and economic rights]], thus decreasing structural violence. However, for these structural interventions to be successful, medical professionals need to be capable of executing such tasks. Unfortunately, many of these professionals are not trained to perform structural interventions.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Moreover, medical professionals continue to operate under conventional clinical intervention because physicians can rightly note that structural interventions are not their job. Therefore, the onus falls more on political and other experts to implement such structural changes. As noted, structural forces account for most if not all epidemic diseases (e.g., HIV). Medical professionals still continue to operate under the downstream phenomenon, with a focus is on individual lifestyle factors rather than general socio-economic, cultural, and environmental conditions. This paradigm obscures the structural impediments to changes because it tends to avoid the root causes that should be focused on. One response is to incorporate medical professionals and to acknowledge that such active structural interventions are necessary to address real public health issues.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt;

The lessons that have been learned from successful examples of structural interventions in these countries are fundamental. Although health disparities resulting from social inequalities are possible to reduce, as long as health care is exchanged as a commodity, those without the power to purchase it will have less access to it. Biosocial research should be the main focus. Sociology can better explain the origin and spread of infectious diseases, such as HIV or AIDS. Research shows that the risk of HIV is highly affected by one's behavior and habits.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt; Although some structural interventions can decrease premature morbidity and mortality, the social and historical determinants of the structural violence cannot be omitted. Although the interventions have enormous influence on economical and political aspects of international bodies, more interventions are needed to improve access.&lt;ref name=PLoS/&gt;

Structural violence also exists in the area of [[mental health]], where systems are designed to ignore the lived experiences of people with mental illnesses when making decisions about services and funding without consulting with the ill, including those who are illiterate, cannot access computers, do not speak the dominant language, are homeless, are too unwell to fill out long formal surveys, or are in locked psychiatric and forensic wards. Online-only consultation may be inappropriate for people with a lived experience of mental illness. Structural violence is also apparent when consumers in developed countries die from preventable diseases 15–25 years earlier than do people without a lived experience of mental health.

'''Tele-information services''' are based on an alliance of digital [[telecommunication]] and [[computer technology]] that play an important role in inter-[[human communication]]s. It is a classification of [[information flow]]s broken down so that the presentation and information content are not confused with the character of the information flow. Tele-information services consist of four definable information traffic patterns being ''allocution'', ''conversation'', ''consultation'' and ''registration''. These [[Tele-information services#Information traffic patterns|information traffic patterns]] can be combined to form more complex multi-pattern services and networks made up of any number of information traffic patterns.&lt;ref name="bordwijk"&gt;Bordewijk, Jan L. and Van Kaam, Ben (2002) [1986] "Towards a New Classification of Tele-Information Services," in Denis McQuail (ed.) ''McQuail's Reader in Mass Communication Theory,'' Sage, London, pp. 113–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information traffic patterns==

* Allocution — the issue of information by an information service centre under programmatic control of the centre itself. Typically has a general/soldier, master/slave relationship. Examples include [[broadcasting]] organisations such as [[radio]] and [[television]].
* Conversation — the issue of information by information services consumer(s) under programmatic control of the consumer(s) themselves. Examples include information flow between consumers or with the help of an interpreter.
* Consultation — the issue of information by an information service provider under programmatic control of an information service consumer. Examples include phoning a doctor, lawyer, reading books, magazines and newspapers as well as cable television and the Internet.
* Registration — the issue of information by an information service consumer under the programmatic control of an information service centre. Examples include a fire alarm, news agencies and some [[MMORPG|MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game)]] such as [[World of Warcraft]].&lt;ref name="bordwijk" /&gt;

In [[scientific visualization]], '''texture advection''' is a family of methods to densely visualize [[vector field]]s or flows (like the wind movement of a tornado). Scientists can use the created images and animations to better understand these flows and reason about them. 
In comparison to techniques that visualise [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]], [[streakline]]s, or [[timeline]]s, methods of this family don't need any seed points and can produce a whole image at every step.

The methods have in common that they bend a whole image (or texture) according to the flow to create a new image that is warped by the flow. If that is done in small enough time steps and often enough, the images can be combined to create an animation visualising the flow.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4836">'''Theatrum Mundi''' (or the Great Theater of the World) is a metaphorical concept developed throughout Western literature and thought, apparent in theories of the world such as [[Plato | Plato's]] [[Allegory of the Cave]], and a popular idea in the [[Baroque Period]] among certain writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoffmeister |first=Gerhart |date=March 2009 |title=World as a Stage - Theatrum Mundi |journal=The Literary Encyclopedia. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This metaphysical explanation of the world portrays the world as a theater (apparent in Shakespeare's saying that "all the world's a stage") wherein people are characters and their actions form a drama, with God as the author, specifically for some [[Christian]] thinkers. This metaphor can take various forms, some more [[Determinism|deterministic]] than others, and has also been formulated in different fashions, such as the world as chess game by the Persian philosopher [[Omar Khayyam]]. In each formulation of the ''theatrum mundi'', though, the world is a sum greater than its parts, where various roles are played by different actors.

==History==

The world as a stage was expressed among the ancient Greeks, and especially gained popularity among [[Stoicism|Stoic]] and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplantonist]] philosophers such as [[Plotinus]] in the [[late antiquity]] of the [[Roman Empire]]. In Neoplatonism, which went on to influence Christianity, the belief of the separate realm of the soul and its transcendence above the instability of worldly affairs influenced philosophers and later, important Christian figures like [[St. Augustine]] to view the world as a theatrical spectacle. 

The relation of God to humanity and the world was expressed throughout the Middle Ages. [[John of Salisbury]], a 12th-century theologian especially coined the term ''theatrum mundi'', characterized by commenting that saints "despise the theater of this world from the heights of their virtue". In several chapters of the third book of his ''[[Policraticus]]'', a moral encyclopedia, he meditates on the fact that "the life of man on earth is a comedy, where each forgetting his own plays another's role". The comedy takes place on the scene/in the world, while the ''auditorium'' is associated to the Christian paradise. Only a few sages, like some Stoic philosophers or the prophets like [[Abraham]] or [[John the Baptist|John the Baptiste]], are able to accept the role given by God. This acceptation allows to extract themselves from the ''theatrum mundi'', to adopt a celestial position in the ''auditorium'', and to watch and understand the roles played in the comedy&lt;ref&gt;John Gillies, ''Shakespeare and the Geography of Difference'', Volume 4 of Cambridge Studies in Renaissance Literature and Culture, Cambridge University Press, 1994. {{ISBN|9780521458535}}. [https://books.google.ca/books?id=HoKybxnJLVMC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;lpg=PA76 Pages 76-77].&lt;/ref&gt;.

The metaphor had intercourse with the actual theater, which could be conversely conceived as a world, or a microcosm. The idea continued to be expressed throughout the early modern period and became less of a strictly theological or philosophical metaphor and began to insert itself in various forms of literature and rhetorical expressions, and its use in certain times has been theorized to be a result of political and religious alienation, especially in the midst of tumultuous historical periods. It is possible that it gradually began to lose its religious connotations, and the ''theatrum mundi'' took on more of a secular, political aspect. But going back to Plato's emphasis in ''Laws'' of a protagonist embodying the ideal political subject by reflecting the ideal plane, this both political and theological formulation of ''theatrum mundi''was eventually propagated by [[Tertullian]] to the point where the sociological idea of [[role (sociology)|roles]] descends from it as well. Additionally, it was also cultivated by the transition towards new social forms; for instance, the trappings of the feudal monarchy in England was seen as "empty" and "theatrical" because they occurred in the social context of an ascendant capitalism. It was in England, moreover, where the metaphor was the most developed, although it was also refined in Spain.

Transforming with the developments of philosophy and culture, the ''theatrum mundi'' became less popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, but more recently reconceptualizations have developed among [[Situationists]] and [[Jean Baudrillard]], as well as [[Brecht]], [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]], and [[Artaud]].

'''Tunnel vision''' &lt;!-- WHAT ABOUT 'KALNIENK VISION" YOU MAY ASK? "KALNIENK VISION" WAS ADDED BY AN ANONYMOUS VANDAL IN 2010 AND HAS SNUCK ITS WAY ONTO THE INTERNET WHEN THIS ARTICLE WAS COPIED PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T NOTICE THAT IT WAS VANDALISM. IF YOU WANT TO RESTORE 'KALNIENK VISION' TO THIS ARTICLE, GET ME PROOF THAT IT WAS USED PRIOR TO 2010. --&gt;is the loss of [[peripheral vision]] with retention of central vision, resulting in a constricted circular [[tunnel]]-like [[visual field|field of vision]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=24514 Medical terms]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Tunnel vision can be caused by:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[Glaucoma]], a disease of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Glaucoma: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001620.htm|website = www.nlm.nih.gov|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Retinitis pigmentosa]], a disease of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Retinitis pigmentosa|url = http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/retinitis-pigmentosa|website = Genetics Home Reference|date = 2016-02-15|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Blood loss ([[hypovolemia]])
* Alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.wright.edu/bie/rehabengr/vision/visionalcohol.htm Effects of Alcohol on Vision] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008100320/http://www.cs.wright.edu/bie/rehabengr/vision/visionalcohol.htm |date=2006-10-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the vision becomes blurred or double since eye muscles lose their precision causing them to be unable to focus on the same object.
* Sustained (1 second or more) high accelerations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051123000128/http://www.vnh.org/FSManual/02/02SustainedAcceleration.html Web Archive: Virtual Naval Hospital]&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, flying an airplane with a centripetal acceleration of up to or over 39&amp;nbsp;m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (4gs) with the head towards the center of curvature, common in aerobatic or fighter pilots. In these cases, tunnel vision and [[greyout (medical)|greyout]] may proceed to a ''g''-force induced Loss Of Consciousness [[G-LOC|(''g''-LOC)]].
* [[Psychedelics, Dissociatives and Deliriants|Hallucinogenic]] drugs, in particular the [[dissociative]]s.
* Extreme fear or distress, most often in the context of a [[panic attack]].
* Excitement or extreme [[pleasure]] such as on a roller-coaster, causing a surge of adrenaline in the body.
* During periods of high [[epinephrine|adrenaline]] production, such as an intense [[hand-to-hand combat|physical fight]].
* [[Altitude sickness]], [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] in passenger aircraft&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061005203309/http://www.house.gov/transportation/aviation/06-05-03/friend.html Web Archive: Aircraft air quality]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exposure to oxygen at a partial pressure above 1.5-2 atmospheres, producing central nervous system oxygen toxicity, called narcosis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051122223954/http://www.vnh.org/FSManual/01/10OxygenToxic.html Web Archive: Virtual Naval Hospital, Oxygen Toxity]&lt;/ref&gt; Other symptoms can include dizziness, nausea, blindness, fatigue, anxiety, confusion and lack of coordination.
* [[Pituitary adenoma|Pituitary tumours]] (or other brain tumours that compress the [[optic chiasm]])
* Prolonged exposure to air contaminated with heated [[hydraulic fluids]] and oils, as can sometimes happen in passenger aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20061005203309/http://www.house.gov/transportation/aviation/06-05-03/friend.html Web Archive: Aircraft air quality]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Severe [[cataract]]s, causing a removal of most of the field of vision
* During the [[Migraine#Aura phase|aura phase of a migraine]]
* Intense anger, due to the body being rapidly flooded with adrenaline and oxygen
* A bite from a [[black mamba]] and other snakes with the same strength venom.
* Mercury poisoning (especially [[methylmercury]])
* Sleep deprivation

==Eyeglass users==
[[Eyeglass]] users experience tunnel vision to varying degrees due to the [[corrective lens]] only providing a small area of proper focus, with the rest of the field of view beyond the lenses being unfocused and blurry. Where a naturally sighted person only needs to move their eyes to see an object far to the side or far down, the eyeglass wearer may need to move their whole head to point the eyeglasses towards the target object.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The eyeglass frame also blocks the view of the world with a thin opaque boundary separating the lens area from the rest of the field of view. The eyeglass frame is capable of obscuring small objects and details in the peripheral field.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Mask, goggle, and helmet users==
[[File:US Navy 050727-N-0295M-010 Electrician's Mate 2nd Class Shane Portton emerges out of the Navy Diver-Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) dive tank exhibit at the 2005 National Scout Jamboree held at Fort A.P. Hill, Va.jpg|thumb|200px|Wide-field, wrap-around diving mask]]

[[File:Navy binoculars.jpg|thumb|150px|Extremely large wide-field binoculars that would not be practical to carry]]

Activities which require a protective mask, safety goggles, or fully enclosing protective helmet can also result in an experience approximating tunnel vision. Underwater [[diving mask]]s using a single flat transparent lens usually have the lens surface several centimeters from the eyes. The lens is typically enclosed with an opaque black rubber sealing shell to keep out water. For this type of mask the peripheral field of the diver is extremely limited. Generally, the peripheral field of a diving mask is improved if the lenses are as close to the eye as possible, or if the lenses are large, multi-window, or is a curved wrap-around design.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Protective helmets such as a [[welding helmet]] restrict vision to an extremely small slot or hole, with no peripheral perception at all. This is done out of necessity so that [[ultraviolet radiation]] emitted from the [[welding arc]] does not damage the welder's eyes due to reflections off shiny objects in the peripheral field.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== Optical instruments ==
[[Binoculars]], [[telescope]]s, and [[microscope]]s induce an experience of extreme tunnel vision due to the design of the optical components. A wide field microscope or telescope generally requires much larger diameter and thicker lenses, or complex parabolic mirror assemblies, either of which results in significantly greater cost for construction of the optical device.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Wide-field binoculars are possible, but require bulkier, heavier, and more complex eyepieces. The diameter of the objective lenses is unimportant for field of view.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.meade.com/support/selbinoc.html&lt;/ref&gt; The widest-angle eyepieces used in telescopes are so large that two would not fit side-by-side for use in binoculars.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In a high-dimensional, human behavioural data set, such as [[Call detail record|mobile phone meta-data]], for each person, there exists potentially thousands of different records. In the case of mobile phone meta-data, [[Card Transaction Data|credit card transaction]] histories and many other types of personal data, this information includes the time and location of an individual. 

In research, unicity is widely used to illustrate the re-identifiability of anonymous data sets. In 2013&lt;ref name="uinc"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; researchers from the [[MIT Media Lab]] showed that only 4 points needed to uniquely identify 95% of individual trajectories in a [[De-identification|de-identified]] data set of 1.5 million mobility trajectories.

==Measuring unicity==
Unicity (&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_p&lt;/math&gt;) is formally defined as the expected value of the fraction of uniquely identifiable trajectories, given ''p'' points selected from those trajectories uniformly at random. A full computation of &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_p&lt;/math&gt; of a data set &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; requires picking ''p'' points uniformly at random from each trajectory &lt;math&gt;T_i \in D&lt;/math&gt;, and then checking whether or not any other trajectory also contains those ''p'' points. Averaging over all possible sets of ''p'' points for each trajectory results in a value for &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_p&lt;/math&gt;. This is usually prohibitively expensive&lt;ref name="smartphones"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as it requires considering every possible set of ''p'' points for each trajectory in the data set — trajectories that sometimes contain thousands of points&lt;ref name="uinc"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uins"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Instead, unicity is usually estimated using sampling techniques. Specifically, given a data set &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, the the estimated unicity is computed by sampling from &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; a fraction of the trajectories &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and then checking whether each of the trajectories &lt;math&gt;T_j \in S&lt;/math&gt; are unique in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; given ''p'' randomly selected points from each &lt;math&gt;T_j&lt;/math&gt;. The fraction of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; that is uniquely identifiable is then the unicity estimate.

In [[meteorology]], '''visibility''' is a measure of the [[distance]] at which an object or light can be clearly discerned.  It is reported within [[surface weather observation]]s and [[METAR]] code either in [[Metre|meters]] or [[Mile#Statute mile|statute miles]], depending upon the country.  Visibility affects all forms of traffic: roads, sailing and aviation. Meteorological visibility refers to transparency of air: in dark, meteorological visibility is still the same as in daylight for the same air.

==Definition==
[[File:Plane flying into clouds.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A commercial aircraft flying into the clouds over Los Angeles]]
[[ICAO]] Annex 3 ''Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation'' &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/www/ISS/Meetings/CT-MTDCF-ET-DRC_Geneva2008/Annex3_16ed.pdf|title=ICAO Annex 3 Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation|last=|first=|date=July 2007|website=|publisher=International Civil Aviation Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-09|edition=16th}}&lt;/ref&gt; contains the following definitions and note:
:a) the greatest distance at which a black object of suitable dimensions, situated near the ground, can be seen and recognized when observed against a bright background;
:b) the greatest distance at which lights of 1,000 [[candela]]s can be seen and identified against an unlit background.
:Note.— The two distances have different values in air of a given [[Attenuation coefficient|extinction coefficient]], and the latter b) varies with the background illumination. The former a) is represented by the meteorological optical range (MOR).
Annex 3 &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; also defines [[Runway visual range|Runway Visual Range (RVR)]] as:
:The range over which the pilot of an aircraft on the centre line of a runway can see the runway surface markings or the lights delineating the runway or identifying its centre line.

[[File:Foggy morning road - visibility at 200 ft.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Fog]]gy morning road]]
[[File:Tel Aviv Carmel Panorama.jpg|thumb|240px|On clear days, Tel Aviv's skyline is visible from the Carmel mountains, 80km north]]

In extremely clean air in Arctic or mountainous areas, the visibility can be up to 160 km (100 miles) where there are large markers such as mountains or high ridges. However, visibility is often reduced somewhat by [[air pollution]] and high [[humidity]].  Various [[weather station]]s report this as [[haze]] (dry) or [[mist]] (moist).  [[Fog]] and [[smoke]] can reduce visibility to near zero, making [[driving]] extremely dangerous.  The same can happen in a [[Dust storm|sandstorm]] in and near [[desert]] areas, or with [[forest fire]]s.  Heavy [[rain]] (such as from a [[thunderstorm]]) not only causes low visibility, but the inability to [[brake]] quickly due to [[Hydroplaning (tires)|hydroplaning]].  [[Blizzard]]s and ground blizzards (blowing snow) are also defined in part by low visibility.

==Derivation==
To define visibility the case of a [[Black body|perfectly black]] object being viewed against a perfectly white background is examined. The [[Contrast (vision)|visual contrast]], ''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;(x), at a distance ''x'' from the black object is defined as the relative difference between the light intensity of the background and the object

&lt;math&gt;C_\text{V}(x) = \frac{F_\text{B}(x) - F(x)}{F_\text{B}(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;(x) and ''F''(x) are the intensities of the background and the object, respectively. Because the object is assumed to be perfectly black, it must absorb all of the light incident on it. Thus when ''x''=0 (at the object), ''F''(0) = 0 and ''C&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;''(0) = 1.

Between the object and the observer, ''F''(x) is affected by additional light that is [[scattering|scattered]] into the observer's line of sight and the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of light by gases and [[Particulate|particles]]. Light scattered by particles outside of a particular beam may ultimately contribute to the [[irradiance]] at the target, a phenomenon known as [[multiple scattering]]. Unlike absorbed light, scattered light is not lost from a system. Rather, it can change directions and contribute to other directions. It is only lost from the original beam traveling in one particular direction. The multiple scattering's contribution to the irradiance at ''x'' is modified by the individual particle scattering coefficient, the number concentration of particles, and the depth of the beam. The intensity change ''dF'' is the result of these effects over a distance ''dx''. Because ''dx'' is a measure of the amount of suspended gases and particles, the fraction of ''F'' that is diminished is assumed to be proportional to the distance, ''dx''.  The fractional reduction in ''F'' is

&lt;math&gt;dF = -b_\text{ext} F dx&lt;/math&gt;

where ''b''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[attenuation coefficient]].  The scattering of background light into the observer's line of sight can increase ''F'' over the distance ''dx''.  This increase is defined as ''b' F''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') ''dx'', where ''b''' is a constant. The overall change in intensity is expressed as

&lt;math&gt;dF(x) = \left[b' F_\text{B}(x) - b_\text{ext} F(x)\right] dx&lt;/math&gt;

Since ''F''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; represents the background intensity, it is independent of ''x'' by definition.  Therefore,

&lt;math&gt;dF_\text{B}(x) = 0 = \left[b' F_\text{B}(x) - b_\text{ext} F_\text{B}(x)\right] dx&lt;/math&gt;

It is clear from this expression that ''b''' must be equal to ''b''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, the visual contrast, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''), obeys the [[Beer–Lambert law]]

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dC_\text{V}(x)}{dx} = - b_\text{ext} C_\text{V}(x)&lt;/math&gt;

which means that the contrast decreases exponentially with the distance from the object:

&lt;math&gt;C_\text{V}(x) = \exp(- b_\text{ext} x)&lt;/math&gt;

Lab experiments have determined that contrast ratios between 0.018 and 0.03 are perceptible under typical daylight viewing conditions. Usually, a contrast ratio of 2% (''C''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.02) is used to calculate visual range. Plugging this value into the above equation and solving for ''x'' produces the following visual range expression (the Koschmieder equation):

&lt;math&gt;x_\text{V} = \frac{3.912}{b_\text{ext}}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''x''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; in units of length.  At sea level, the [[Rayleigh scattering|Rayleigh atmosphere]] has an extinction coefficient of approximately 13.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; at a [[wavelength]] of 520&amp;nbsp;nm.  This means that in the cleanest possible atmosphere, visibility is limited to about 296&amp;nbsp;km.

Visibility perception depends on several physical and visual factors. A realistic definition should consider the fact that the human visual system (HVS) is highly sensitive to spatial frequencies, and then to use the Fourier transform and the contrast sensitivity
function of the HVS to assess visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Moreno|first1 = Ivan|last2 = Jauregui-Sánchez|first2 = Y.|last3 = Avendaño-Alejo|first3 = Maximino|year = 2014|title = Invisibility assessment: a visual perception approach|url = http://fisica.uaz.edu.mx/~imoreno/Publicaciones/JOSA2014.pdf|journal = Journal of the Optical Society of America A|volume = 31|issue = 10|pages = 2244–2248|doi = 10.1364/josaa.31.002244|bibcode = 2014JOSAA..31.2244M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fog, mist, haze, and freezing drizzle==
The international definition of fog is a visibility of less than {{convert|1|km|ft}}; mist is a visibility of between {{convert|1|km|mi}} and {{convert|2|km|mi}} and haze from {{convert|2|km|mi}} to {{convert|5|km|mi}}. Fog and mist are generally assumed to be composed principally of water droplets, haze and smoke can be of smaller particle size; this has implications for sensors such as Thermal Imagers (TI/FLIR) operating in the far-IR at wavelengths of about 10 μm which are better able to penetrate haze and some smokes because their particle size is smaller than the wavelength; the IR radiation is therefore not significantly deflected or absorbed by the particles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} 

With fog, occasional [[freezing drizzle]] and [[snow]] can occur. This usually occurs when temperatures are below 0° Celsius (32° Fahrenheit). Hazards can include slipping and falling on ice or slipping in your car on ice causing a potential lethal crash. Low visibility below 1000 yards is usually accompanied with this. Low lying stratus clouds are the culprit of most of these cold weather events.

==Very low visibility==
Visibility of less than {{convert|100|m|ft}} is usually reported as zero.  In these conditions, [[road]]s may be closed, or automatic warning lights and signs may be activated to warn drivers.  These have been put in place in certain areas that are subject to repeatedly low visibility, particularly after [[traffic collision]]s or  [[pile-up]]s involving multiple vehicles.

==Low visibility warnings==
In addition, an advisory is often issued by a government weather agency for low visibility, such as a dense fog advisory from the U.S. [[National Weather Service]].  These generally advise motorists to avoid [[travel]] until the fog dissipates or other conditions improve.  [[Airport]] travel is also often delayed by low visibility, sometimes causing long waits due to [[Instrument approach#Decision_height_or_altitude|approach visibility minimums]] and the difficulty of safely moving aircraft on the ground in low visibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why fog can play havoc with your travel plans|url=http://www.newcastleairport.com.au/blog/why-fog-can-play-havoc-with-your-travel-plans#.WayUZciGOUk|website=www.newcastleairport.com.au|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project AS 07/13 - Regulation of Low Visibility Operations|url=https://www.casa.gov.au/standard-page/project-0713-regulation-low-visibility-operations?WCMS%3APWA%3A%3Apc=PC_93101|website=www.casa.gov.au|publisher=Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority|accessdate=3 September 2017|language=en|date=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visibility and air pollution==
A visibility reduction is probably the most apparent symptom of [[air pollution]].  Visibility degradation is caused by the [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[scattering]] of light by particles and gases in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. Absorption of [[electromagnetic radiation]] by gases and particles is sometimes the cause of discolorations in the atmosphere but usually does not contribute very significantly to visibility degradation.

Scattering by particulates impairs visibility much more readily. Visibility is reduced by significant scattering from particles between an observer and a distant object. The particles scatter light from the [[sun]] and the rest of the sky through the line of sight of the observer, thereby decreasing the contrast between the object and the background sky. Particles that are the most effective at reducing visibility (per unit [[aerosol]] mass) have diameters in the range of 0.1-1.0&amp;nbsp;µm. The effect of air molecules on visibility is minor for short visual ranges but must be taken into account for ranges above 30&amp;nbsp;km.

'''Ximena Zomosa''' (born 1966, [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]]) is a [[Visual arts|visual artist]] and [[curator]] who works in [[contemporary art]]&lt;ref name=ref_11 /&gt; and [[conceptual art]],&lt;ref name=ref_1 /&gt; whose work demonstrates — from the perspective of [[gender]]&lt;ref name=ref_3 /&gt; — a discourse that is fundamentally feminine.&lt;ref name=ref_4 /&gt; She acted in a managerial and curatorial capacity at the Balmaceda Youth Art Gallery, a space for art by emerging Chilean artists.&lt;ref name=ref_10&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zomosa studied art at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile]], which complemented her studies at various Chilean universities.&lt;ref name=ref_1 /&gt; Her work is characterized by "la originalidad mostrada en el empleo de materiales sacados de la vida cotidiana y dispuestos en instalaciones inusuales (...). En su afán transformatorio, es evidente un sentido autobiográfico e irónico frente a lo femenino y lo doméstico" ("originality demonstrated in the use of materials from everyday life and displayed in unusual installations (...). In her eager transformation, there is a sense of the autobiographical and irony in the face of that which is feminine and that which is domestic").&lt;ref name=ref_1 /&gt;

In 2004, Zomosa received the [[Altazor Award|Altazor Award of the National Arts]] in the category of Installations and Video Art for ''Colección de la artista'' (''Artist's Collection'').&lt;ref name=ref_2&gt;{{Cite web
