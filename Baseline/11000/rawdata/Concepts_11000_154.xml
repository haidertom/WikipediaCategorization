'''''3D&amp;T''''', formerly known as "Defensores de Tóquio", is a [[Brazil]]ian [[tabletop role-playing game]], created by [[Marcelo Cassaro]]. It is designed to be a very simple, beginner-friendly game system.

==History==

=== Origin ===
The name of the game is a pun on the famous ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' or "D&amp;D"; the original version of the game – ''Defensores de Tóquio'' ("Defenders of Tokyo") – was a satire of [[tokusatsu]], [[fighting game]]s, and [[anime]] series. It was created by [[Marcelo Cassaro]] and published by Trama Editorial, later known as Editora Talismã. It spawned "AD&amp;T" - as implied by the name, an "advanced" edition (and a pun on [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons|AD&amp;D]]). Finally, "3D&amp;T" means "Defenders of Tokyo 3rd edition". The major change on the 3rd edition was that it was turned into a [[generic game]], dropping its satire roots. It was a huge success, becoming as popular as ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' among Brazilian roleplayers.

An even simpler version, like [[GURPS Lite]] called "3D&amp;T Fastplay", was made freely available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragaobrasil.com.br/3d&amp;t/fastplay.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731015325/http://www.dragaobrasil.com.br/3d&amp;t/fastplay.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=31 July 2008|title=Dragão Brasil -- Site Oficial da Revista Dragão Brasil|date=31 July 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A revision, "3D&amp;T Manual Revisado, Ampliado e Turbinado", was released in 2003.

Dissatisfied with the poor management at Talismã – also publishers of RPG magazine ''Dragão Brasil'', of which he was editor-in-chief – Marcelo Cassaro left to start a new RPG magazine, ''RPG Master'' for Mythos Editora, a magazine entirely dedicated to 3D&amp;T (although the news releases for other systems)&lt;ref&gt;Talu (June 27, 2005), [http://www.rederpg.com.br/portal/modules/news/article.php?storyid=2864 RPGMaster #01 - Tópico a Tópico] RedeRPG&lt;/ref&gt; and soon after, ''Dragon Slayer'', fully devoted to the [[d20 System]]; meanwhile, Talismã kept publishing 3D&amp;T, despite ''not'' having the rights to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamboeditora.com.br:80/noticias/3d&amp;t-bastidores.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226213310/http://www.jamboeditora.com.br:80/noticias/3d&amp;t-bastidores.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 February 2009|title=Jambô Editora|date=26 February 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, ''Dragon Slayer'' was very successful and remains in print, while Talismã closed their doors.

===4D&amp;T===
As a successor to 3D&amp;T, a new system named 4D&amp;T was published in 2006 by [[Editora JBC]] (Brazilian publisher of manga). It completely dropped 3D&amp;T's own fast, in this the player uses 4 [[six-sided dice]]. The book was published under the [[Open Game License]]. This edition is itself a change of the [[d20 System]], but with six-sided dice.

Although it has succeeded on its own, it has been poorly received by 3D&amp;T players, given the original purpose of the system was to be as simple as possible.

===3D&amp;T Alpha===
In May 2008, Cassaro was told by Guilherme Dei Svaldi, editor-in-chief at Jambô Editora, that he found 3D&amp;T to remain very popular, despite being out of print for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.doutorcareca.com.br/?p=239 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-01-05 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130115044514/http://www.doutorcareca.com.br/?p=239 |archive-date=2013-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This surprised Cassaro, and gave him the idea of bringing 3D&amp;T back; it was released again in September 2008, under the name "3D&amp;T Alpha"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/noticias/3d&amp;t-anuncio.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223231244/http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/noticias/3d&amp;t-anuncio.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=23 February 2009|title=Jambô Editora|date=23 February 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the new name inspired by ''[[Street Fighter Alpha 3]]'', which Cassaro and [[Erica Awano]] had adapted into a 4-issue comic book series published by Trama in 1998/99&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fenixdown.com.br/2011/11/gamics-002/&lt;/ref&gt;). It is also available as a free [[e-book]] from Jambô's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/produtos/3d%26t.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724101436/http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/produtos/3d%26t.htm |archive-date=2010-07-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this new version, the combat rules remain basically the same; the advantage/disadvantage system was fine-tuned; and, most importantly, the magic system was completely revamped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/noticias/3d%26t-anuncio.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122142930/http://www.jamboeditora.com.br/noticias/3d%26t-anuncio.php |archive-date=2008-11-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, now the book is printed in [[Page orientation|landscape]] format.

In 2010 the first major setting for 3D&amp;T Alpha was announced: '''Mega City,''' by Gustavo Brauner. It was finally published in mid-2012, bringing as setting a [[Megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] in which five different smaller settings coexist: 
*'''''Super Mega City''''' (featuring superheroes and supervillains, similar to characters from [[DC Comics]] and [[Marvel Comics]])
*'''''Torneio das Sombras''''' (''Tournament of the Shadows'', featuring martial artists similar to the ones in video games like [[Street Fighter]], [[Tekken]] and [[The King of Fighters]])
*'''''Megadroide''''' (''Megadroid'', featuring characters equipped with futuristic technology inspired in Japanese pop culture like [[Mega Man]] and [[Astro Boy]]; a later handbook expanded this setting to include references to [[Mecha]] and [[Tokusatsu]] genres)
*'''''Crônicas de Nova Memphis''''' (''Nova Memphis Chronicles'', featuring supernatural creatures such as vampires, werewolves, angels and demons, similar to the [[World of Darkness]] RPG setting)
*'''''Mega City Contra-Ataca''''' (''Mega City Strikes Back'', featuring regular people such as police officers, scientists, athletes and journalists among several other occupations, for more realistic adventures)
'''Mega City''' allows to either choose one of the smaller settings to play, or to combine some of them (or even all of them), teaching how to balance the different kinds of characters.

A second major setting was released in the same year: '''Brigada Ligeira Estelar''' ''(Star Light Brigade),'' by Alexandre Lancaster. It's a [[mecha]]/[[space opera]]/[[swashbuckling]] setting, bringing an empire spread in seventeen solar systems that together form the '''Constellation of Sabre''' – main target of invaders from outer space called ''The Forsaken,'' while the empire itself is divided by political intrigue. ''Brigada'' brings a heavy influence of classic sci-fi anime like [[Mobile Suit Gundam]], [[Captain Harlock]], [[Legend of the Galactic Heroes]] and [[Star Blazers]], having as player characters [[mecha]] ace pilots, [[space pirates]], space [[condottieri]], swashbuckling [[noblemen]] and others.

== Overview ==
A game aimed at beginners, 3D&amp;T focus on simplicity and ease of play.

As in [[GURPS]], each character is built with a pre-determined number of "points" (typically 5) to distribute between the main stats, magic power and advantages and disadvantages.

There are 5 stats:
* "Força" - Strength (which does not only measures the physical might of the character but also skill in melee combat)
* "Habilidade" - Ability (which measures manual dextery, speed and mental abilities)
* "Resistência" - Resistance (which measures the "health" of the character, and defines its Hit Points)
* "Armadura" - Armor (which measures how well the character can protect him/herself)
* "Poder de Fogo" - Firepower (which measures skill with ranged attacks - anything from firearms to bows and throwing daggers)

The magical powers of characters are defined by "Elemental Paths" ("Caminhos Elementais", in the original), which measure how well the mage can control the elements - there are 6 "Elemental Paths": Fire ("Fogo"), Water ("Água"), Earth ("Terra"), Air ("Ar"), Light ("Luz") and Darkness ("Trevas").

Advantages and disadvantages are special powers which characters can possess; advantages cost points, and disadvantages ''give'' more points to spend. Finally, there is also a special kind of advantages, called "skills" ("Perícias"), which are things that your character can do, but with no relation to combat: "Animals","Arts", "Crime", "Investigation","Languages", "Machines","Manipulation", "Medicine", "Science","Sports" and "Survival."

{{Locke}}
'''''A Letter Concerning Toleration''''' by [[John Locke]] was originally published in 1689. Its initial publication was in [[Latin]], though it was immediately translated into other languages. Locke's work appeared amidst a fear that [[Catholicism]] might be taking over England, and responds to the problem of religion and government by proposing [[religious toleration]] as the answer. This "letter" is addressed to an anonymous "Honored Sir": this was actually Locke's close friend [[Philipp van Limborch]], who published it without Locke's knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;A Letter Concerning Toleration by Locke, John; Tully, James H.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In the wake of discovery of the [[Rye House Plot]] and [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s persecution of the Whigs, Locke fled England to Amsterdam, Holland in September 1683.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Klibansky, 'Preface', in Klibansky and J. W. Gough (eds.), ''Espitola de Tolerantia/A Letter on Toleration'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Cranston, ''John Locke: A Biography'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985), pp. 227-230.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his life, Locke had taken an interest in the debate about religious toleration. The question was much debated in Holland during Locke's stay and in October 1685 [[Louis XIV of France]] [[Edict of Fontainebleau|Revoked]] the [[Edict of Nantes]] that had guaranteed religious toleration for French Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky, p. x, pp.
xvi-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Holland, Locke met [[Philipp van Limborch]], a Professor of Divinity, and it was to be a discussion with Limborch that persuaded Locke to temporarily put aside his work on ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' and put forth his ideas on toleration. Locke wrote the ''Letter'' during the winter of 1685-86.&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky, pp. viii-ix, p. x, pp. xvi-xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument of the ''Letter''==
One of the founders of [[Empiricism]], Locke develops a [[philosophy]] that is contrary to the one expressed by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', in supporting toleration for various [[Christian]] denominations. Hobbes did allow for individuals to maintain their own religious beliefs as long as they outwardly expressed those of the state, however, and it has been argued that Locke's rejection of Catholic Imperialism was the ultimate basis for his rejection of government's interest in spiritual salvation.&lt;ref&gt;E. C. Graf, 2007: ''Cervantes and Modernity: Four Essays on Modernity'', Bucknell University Press, pp. 141-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Hobbes, who saw uniformity of religion as the key to a well-functioning civil society, Locke argues that more religious groups actually prevent civil unrest. Locke argues that civil unrest results from confrontations caused by any magistrate's attempt to prevent different religions from being practiced, rather than tolerating their proliferation. Locke's primary goal is to "distinguish exactly the business of civil government from that of religion." He seeks to persuade the reader that government is instituted to promote external interests, relating to life, liberty, and the general welfare, while the church exists to promote internal interests, i.e., salvation. The two serve separate functions, and so, must be considered to be separate institutions.

For Locke, the only way a Church can gain genuine converts is through persuasion and not through violence. This relates to his central conclusion, namely, that the government should not involve itself in care of souls. In support of this argument he presents three main reasons: (1) individuals, according to Locke, cannot divest control over their souls to secular forces, as God does not appoint the magistrate; (2) force cannot create the change necessary for salvation, because while it can coerce obedience, it cannot change one's beliefs; and (3) even if coercion could persuade someone of a notion, it would not help with ensuring salvation, because there is no reason to believe that magistrates are reliable judges of religious truth.

Locke argued that those who believed that "faith need not be kept with heretics" and that "kings excommunicated forfeit their kingdoms"
had "no right to be tolerated by the magistrate". Neither did "those who refuse to teach that dissenters from their own religion should be tolerated". This was because those who believed such doctrines would, given the opportunity,
attack the laws and the liberty and property of the citizen. These people, Locke argued, sought religious toleration "only until they have supplies and forces enough to make the attempt" on liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky and Gough, pp. 131-33.&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrines that "faith need not be kept with heretics" and that "kings excommunicated forfeit their kingdoms" were commonly held to be Catholic beliefs by Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;John Marshall, ''John Locke, Toleration and Early Enlightenment Culture'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 690-91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky and Gough,
pp. 160-61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Goldie (ed.), ''A Letter Concerning Toleration and Other Writings'' (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2010), p. 50, notes 127 and 128.&lt;/ref&gt; During his visit to France in 1676, Locke recorded that the belief that "faith does not have to be kept with heretics" was an important factor in the intolerance shown to the Protestant [[Huguenots]].&lt;ref&gt;John Lough (ed.), ''Locke's Travels in France, 1675-9: As related in his Journals, Correspondence and other papers'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1953), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

"That church can have no right to be tolerated by the magistrate," Locke argued, "which is so constituted that all who enter it ''ipso facto'' pass into the allegiance and service of another prince".&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky and Gough,
p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; If this were to be tolerated, "the magistrate would make room for a foreign jurisdiction in his own territory and...allow for his own people to be enlisted as soldiers against his own government".&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky and Gough,
p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been interpreted by historians as a reference to the Catholic Church, with the Pope being the prince to whom Catholics owed allegiance.&lt;ref&gt;Cranston, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky,
p. xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Gough, 'Introduction',
in Klibansky and Gough, pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Gough, ''John Locke's Political Philosophy: Eight Studies'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1973), p.
197.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Sowerby, ''Making Toleration: The Repealers and the Glorious Revolution'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2013), p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, more recently scholars have challenged the idea that Locke opposed the toleration of Catholics in all circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, pp. 690-694.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Goldie, 'Introduction', in Goldie (ed.), ''A Letter Concerning Toleration and Other Writings'', p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sowerby, p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Goldie]] argues that the traditional interpretation of Locke's position on Catholics "needs finessing, since he did not, in fact, exclude the theoretical possibility of tolerating Catholics...if Catholics could discard their uncivil beliefs, they could then be tolerated".&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldie asserts that Locke was opposed not to Catholicism as such but [[antinomianism]], the belief that ordinary moral laws are superseded by religious truth.&lt;ref&gt;Goldie, p. xix.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott Sowerby]] also claims that Locke left open the possibility that Catholics could be tolerated if they adopted tolerant principles and rejected political allegiance to the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Sowerby,
p. 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Marshall (historian)|John Marshall]] has argued that a number of passages in the ''Letter'' demonstrate that Locke believed that Catholics "in their terms of worship and religious speculative beliefs...deserved their worship to be free".&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 691.&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall also notes that "The combination of Locke’s comments in the Letter suggest that during [its] composition ... Locke was once again struggling over how to discriminate between the series of associated political principles which for him made Catholics intolerable, and the religious worship and other religious beliefs of Catholics which deserved toleration."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 692.&lt;/ref&gt;

Locke argued that [[atheists]] should not be tolerated because "Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon or sanctity for an atheist".&lt;ref&gt;Klibansky and Gough, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is, however,  a passage added in a later edition of the ''[[Essay concerning Human Understanding]]'', where Locke perhaps questioned "whether 'atheism' was necessarily inimical to political obedience."&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toleration]] is central to Locke's political philosophy. Consequently, only churches that teach toleration are to be allowed in his society. Locke’s view on the difficulty of knowing the [[one true religion]] may suggest that religion is not personally important to Locke, but it also may point to the deep uncertainties surrounding religious belief in a time of political and intellectual conflict. In contrast, Locke’s view on atheism suggests that he was far from considering religion as unimportant. As an empiricist, he took practical considerations into account, such as how the peace of civil society will be affected by religious toleration. A close reading of the text also reveals that Locke relies on [[Bible|Biblical]] analysis at several key points in his argument.

==Reception==
There were immediate responses from the [[High Church]] Anglican clergy, published by [[Thomas Long (writer)|Thomas Long]] and [[Jonas Proast]]. Long believed the letter was written by an atheistically disguised Jesuit plot for the Roman Catholic Church to gain dominance by bringing chaos and ruin to church and state. Proast attacked the Letter and defended the view that the government has the right to use force to cause dissenters to reflect on the merits of Anglicanism, the True Religion.  Locke's reply to Proast developed into an extended, controversial exchange.

An example of algorithmic art produced with the software ''Structure Synth''.&lt;ref name=Hvidtfeldt&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hvidtfeldt Christensen |first1=Mikael |title=Hvitfeldts.net |url=http://hvidtfeldts.net/ |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Algorithmic art''', also known as ''algorithm art'', is art, mostly [[visual art]], of which the design is generated by an [[algorithm]]. Algorithmic artists are sometimes called '''algorists'''.

==Overview==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}
Algorithmic art, also known as [[computer-generated art]], is a subset of [[generative art]] (generated by an autonomous system) and is related to [[systems art]] (influenced by systems theory). [[Fractal art]] is an example of algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=UCSB&gt;{{cite web |title=Approximating Reality with Interactive Algorithmic Art |url=http://www.mat.ucsb.edu/~g.legrady/academic/courses/01sp200a/students/brentYokota/200a_fin.html |publisher=University of California Santa Barbara |accessdate=25 December 2015 |date=7 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an image of reasonable size, even the simplest [[algorithm]]s require too much calculation for manual execution to be practical, and they are thus executed on either a single computer or on a cluster of computers.  The final output is typically displayed on a [[computer monitor]], printed with a [[wikt:raster|raster]]-type printer, or drawn using a [[plotter]].  Variability can be introduced by using [[pseudo-random]] numbers.  There is no consensus as to whether the product of an algorithm that operates on an existing image (or on any input other than pseudo-random numbers) can still be considered computer-generated art, as opposed to computer-assisted art.&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Darb-i Imam shrine spandrel.JPG|thumb|left|[[Islamic geometric patterns]] such as this [[girih]] tiling in the [[Darb-e Imam]] shrine in [[Isfahan]], are precursors of algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;]]

[[Roman Verostko]] argues that [[Islamic geometric patterns]] are constructed using algorithms, as are [[Italian Renaissance]] paintings which make use of [[mathematics and art|mathematical techniques]], in particular [[linear perspective]] and proportion.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;

[[File:San Romano Battle (Paolo Uccello, London) 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2&lt;!--width for very low image--&gt;|[[Paolo Uccello]] made innovative use of a geometric algorithm, incorporating [[linear perspective]] in paintings such as ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' (c. 1435–1460): broken lances run along perspective lines.]]

Some of the earliest known examples of computer-generated algorithmic art were created by [[Georg Nees]], [[Frieder Nake]], [[A. Michael Noll]], [[Manfred Mohr]] and [[:fr:Vera Molnár|Vera Molnár]] in the early 1960s. These artworks were executed by a [[plotter]] controlled by a [[computer]], and were therefore computer-generated art but not [[digital art]]. The act of creation lay in writing the [[Computer program|program]], which specified the sequence of actions to be performed by the [[plotter]]. [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] established Generative Systems as a program at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1970 in response to social change brought about in part by the computer-robot communications revolution.&lt;ref name = "SLS 83"&gt;Sonia Landy Sheridan, "Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas", in: ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo]]'', Vol. 16, No. 2 (Spring, 1983), pp. 103-108. {{doi|10.2307/1574794}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her early work with copier and telematic art focused on the differences between the human hand and the algorithm.&lt;ref name="MF1"&gt;Flanagan, Mary. "An Appreciation on the Impact of the work of Sonia Landy Sheridan." The Art of Sonia Landy Sheridan. Hanover, NH: [[Hood Museum of Art]], 2009, pp. 37–42.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Aside from the ongoing work of Roman Verostko and his fellow algorists, the next known examples are [[fractal art]]works created in the mid to late 1980s. These are important here because they use a different means of execution. Whereas the earliest algorithmic art was "drawn" by a [[plotter]], [[fractal art]] simply creates an image in [[computer memory]]; it is therefore [[digital art]]. The native form of a [[fractal art]]work is an image stored on a [[computer]]&amp;nbsp;–this is also true of very nearly all equation art and of most recent algorithmic art in general. However, in a stricter sense "fractal art" is not considered algorithmic art, because the algorithm is not devised by the artist.&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;

In light of such ongoing developments, pioneer algorithmic artist [[Ernest Edmonds]] has documented the continuing prophetic role of art in human affairs by tracing the early 1960s association between art and the computer up to a present time in which the algorithm is now widely recognized as a key concept for society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-0752/7/1/3|author=Ernest Edmonds|date=15 January 2018|title=Algorithmic Art Machines|publisher=Arts|doi=10.3390/arts7010003|accessdate=27 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The role of the algorithm==
[[File:Judson Rosebush Visions 15101 Computer Art April 22, 1978 JGR19780422 100.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|''Letter Field'' by Judson Rosebush, 1978. [[Calcomp plotter]] computer output with liquid inks on rag paper, 15.25 x 21 inches. This image was created using an early version of what became [[Digital Effects]]' Vision software, in [[APL (programming language)|APL]] and [[Fortran]] on an [[IBM 370]]/158. A database of the Souvenir font; [[Statistical randomness|random number]] generation, a statistical basis to determine letter size, color, and position; and a hidden line algorithm combine to produce this scan line [[raster image]], output to a plotter.]]

From one point of view, for a work of art to be considered algorithmic art, its creation must include a process based on an [[algorithm]] devised by the artist. Here, an algorithm is simply a detailed recipe for the design and possibly execution of an artwork, which may include [[computer code]], [[function (mathematics)|functions]], [[expression (mathematics)|expressions]], or other input which ultimately determines the form the art will take.&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt; This input may be [[mathematical]], [[computation]]al, or generative in nature. Inasmuch as algorithms tend to be [[deterministic]], meaning that their repeated execution would always result in the production of identical artworks, some external factor is usually introduced. This can either be a random number generator of some sort, or an external body of data (which can range from recorded heartbeats to frames of a movie.) Some artists also work with organically based gestural input which is then modified by an algorithm. By this definition, [[fractal]]s made by a fractal program are not art, as humans are not involved. However, defined differently, algorithmic art can be seen to include fractal art, as well as other varieties such as those using [[genetic algorithm]]s. The artist [[Kerry Mitchell]] stated in his 1999 ''Fractal Art Manifesto'':&lt;ref name=Mitchell2009&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Kerry |title=Selected Works |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-QUyAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA7 |date=24 July 2009| publisher=Lulu.com&lt;!--This book is published by the artist himself, and can be relied on only for his own point of view.--&gt;|isbn=978-0-557-08398-5|pages=7–8}} This artist is notable for his place in the Fractal Art movement, as is his opinion and manifesto.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCSB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mitchell, Kerry |title=The Fractal Art Manifesto |url=https://www.fractalus.com/info/manifesto.htm |publisher=Fractalus.com |accessdate=27 December 2015 |date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Fractal Art is not..Computer(ized) Art, in the sense that the computer does all the work. The work is executed on a computer, but only at the direction of the artist. Turn a computer on and leave it alone for an hour. When you come back, no art will have been generated.&lt;ref name=Mitchell2009/&gt;}}

==Algorists==
"Algorist" is a term used for [[digital artist]]s who create algorithmic art.&lt;ref name=Verostko&gt;{{cite web |last1=Verostko |first1=Roman |title=Algorithmic Art |url=http://www.verostko.com/algorithm.html |date=1999 |origyear=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorists formally began correspondence and establishing their identity as artists following a panel titled "Art and Algorithms" at [[SIGGRAPH]] in 1995. The co-founders were [[Jean-Pierre Hébert]] and [[Roman Verostko]]. Hébert is credited with coining the term and its definition, which is in the form of his own algorithm:&lt;ref name=Verostko/&gt;

 if (creation &amp;&amp; object of art &amp;&amp; algorithm &amp;&amp; one's own algorithm) {
      return * an algorist *
 } else {
      return * not an algorist *
 }

===Types===
[[File:Morphogenic digital art exhibition by Andy Lomas at Watermans Arts Centre, London.jpg|thumb|''[[Morphogenetic]] Creations'', a computer-generated digital art exhibition using programmed algorithms by [[Andy Lomas]], at the [[Watermans Arts Centre]], west London, 2016]]

[[Cellular automata]] can be used to generate artistic patterns with an appearance of randomness, or to modify images such as photographs by applying a transformation such as the stepping stone rule (to give an impressionist style) repeatedly until the desired artistic effect is achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hoke |first1=Brian P. |title=Cellular Automata and Art |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.pattern/FinalProject/Hoke.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=24 December 2015 |date=21 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their use has also been explored in music.&lt;ref name="Burraston Edmonds 2005 pp. 165–185"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Burraston | first=Dave | last2=Edmonds | first2=Ernest | title=Cellular automata in generative electronic music and sonic art: a historical and technical review | journal=Digital Creativity | volume=16 | issue=3 | year=2005 | doi=10.1080/14626260500370882 | pages=165–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fractal art]] consists of varieties of computer-generated [[fractals]] with colouring chosen to give an attractive effect.&lt;ref name="fgad"&gt;{{cite book |title=Fractal geometry in architecture and design |last=Bovill |first=Carl |year=1996 |publisher=Birkhauser |location=Boston |isbn=0-8176-3795-8 |page=153 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w5ptaiGsac4C |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the western world, it is not drawn or painted by hand. It is usually created indirectly with the assistance of [[fractal-generating software]], [[iteration|iterating]] through three phases: setting [[parameter]]s of appropriate fractal software; executing the possibly lengthy calculation; and evaluating the product. In some cases, other [[graphics software|graphics programs]] are used to further modify the images produced. This is called post-processing. Non-fractal imagery may also be integrated into the artwork.&lt;ref name="mra"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.casperjournal.com/article_bbe58a64-0b86-5e64-8fc5-459eafbe67fb.html |title=Meet Reginald Atkins, mathematical artist |author=Conner, Elysia |date=25 February 2009 |publisher=CasperJournal.com |accessdate=28 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic or evolutionary art makes use of [[genetic algorithm]]s to develop images iteratively, selecting at each "generation" according to a rule defined by the artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Eberle |first1=Robert |title=Evolutionary Art - Genetic Algorithm |url=http://www.saatchiart.com/art/New-Media-Evolutionary-Art-Genetic-Algorithm/57335/1837679/view |publisher=Saatchi Art |accessdate=25 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Reynolds |first1=Craig |title=Evolutionary Computation and its application to art and design |url=http://www.red3d.com/cwr/evolve.html |publisher=Reynolds engineering &amp; Design |accessdate=25 December 2015 |date=27 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Algorithmic art is not only produced by computers. Wendy Chun explains:&lt;ref name=Chun2011/&gt;

{{quote|Software is unique in its status as metaphor for metaphor itself. As A universal imitator/machine, it encapsulates a logic of general substitutability ; a logic of ordering and creative, animating disordering. Joseph Weizenbaum has argued that computers have become metaphors for "effective procedures," that is, for anything that can be solved in a prescribed number of steps, such as gene expression and clerical work.&lt;ref name=Chun2011&gt;{{cite book |author=Chun, Wendy Hui Kyong |year=2011 |title=Programmed Visions: Software and Memory |page=2 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0262518512}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The American artist, [[Jack Ox]], has used algorithms to produce paintings that are [[music visualization|visualizations of music]] without using a computer. Two examples are ''visual performances'' of extant scores, such as [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Bruckner)|Eighth Symphony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Ox, Jack |year=1990 |url=https://www.academia.edu/35788162/The_Systematic_Translation_of_Anton_Bruckners_Eighth_Symphony_into_a_Series_of_Thirteen_Paintings |title=The Systematic Translation of Anton Bruckner's Eighth Symphony into a Series of Thirteen Paintings |conference=Bruckner Symposium 1990 |location=Linz, Austria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://intermediaprojects.org/pages/Bruckner.html |title=Bruckner: Eighth Symphony visualized themes |publisher=Intermedia Projects |accessdate=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kurt Schwitters]]' ''Ursonate''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ox, Jack |year=1993 |title=Creating a Visual Translation of Kurt Schwitters' Ursonate |journal=Leonardo Music Journal |volume=3 |pages=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jackox.net/pages/Ursonate/UrPaintMv1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she and her collaborator, Dave Britton, created the 21st Century Virtual Color Organ that does use computer coding and algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ox |first1=Jack |last2=Britton |first2=Dave |year=2000 |url=https://www.academia.edu/785266/The_21st_century_virtual_reality_color_organ |title=The 21st Century Virtual Reality Color Organ |journal=Journal of IEEE Computer Society |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=2–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18503">An '''autonomous robot''' is a [[robot]] that performs [[Behavior-based robotics|behaviors]] or tasks with a high degree of [[autonomy]]. Autonomous robotics is usually considered to be a subfield of [[artificial intelligence]], [[robotics]], and [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/|title=Information Engineering Main/Home Page|website=www.robots.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Autonomous robots are particularly desirable in fields such as [[spaceflight]], household maintenance (such as cleaning), [[waste water treatment]], and delivering goods and services.

Some modern [[factory robot]]s are "autonomous" within the strict confines of their direct environment. It may not be that every [[degree of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] exists in their surrounding environment, but the factory [[robot]]'s workplace is challenging and can often contain chaotic, unpredicted variables. The exact orientation and position of the next object of work and (in the more advanced factories) even the type of object and the required task must be determined. This can vary unpredictably (at least from the robot's point of view).

One important area of robotics research is to enable the robot to cope with its environment whether this be on land, underwater, in the air, underground, or in [[outer space|space]].

A fully autonomous robot can{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}:
* Gain information about the environment
* Work for an extended period without human intervention
* Move either all or part of itself throughout its operating environment without human assistance
* [[Three Laws of Robotics|Avoid situations that are harmful to people]], property, or itself unless those are part of its design specifications

An autonomous robot may also learn or gain new knowledge like adjusting for new methods of accomplishing its tasks or adapting to changing surroundings.

Like other machines, autonomous robots still require regular maintenance.

== Examples ==

=== Self-maintenance ===
&lt;!-- [[Image:PeopleGuide.jpg|left|thumb|Exteroceptive sensors: 1. blue laser rangefinder senses up to 360 distance readings in a 180-degree slice; 2. 24 round golden ultrasonic sensors sample range readings in a 15-degree cone; 3. ten touch panels along the bottom detect shoes and other low-lying objects. 4. break beams between the lower and upper segments sense tables and other mid-level obstacles.]] --&gt;

The first requirement for complete physical autonomy is the ability for a robot to take care of itself. Many of the battery-powered robots on the market today can find and connect to a charging station, and some toys like Sony's ''[[Aibo]]'' are capable of self-docking to charge their batteries.

Self-maintenance is based on "proprioception", or sensing one's own internal status. In the battery charging example, the robot can tell proprioceptively that its batteries are low and it then seeks the charger. Another common proprioceptive sensor is for heat monitoring. Increased proprioception will be required for robots to work autonomously near people and in harsh environments. Common proprioceptive sensors include thermal, optical, and haptic sensing, as well as the [[Hall effect]] (electric).

[[Image:MobileEyesIntel.jpg|right|thumb|Robot GUI display showing battery voltage and other proprioceptive data in lower right-hand corner. The display is for user information only. Autonomous robots monitor and respond to [[Proprioception|proprioceptive]] sensors without human intervention to keep themselves safe and operating properly.]]

=== Sensing the environment ===
Exteroception is sensing things about the environment. Autonomous robots must have a range of environmental sensors to perform their task and stay out of trouble.

*Common exteroceptive sensors include the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], [[sound]], touch, chemical (smell, [[odor]]), temperature, range to various objects, and [[altitude]].

Some robotic lawn mowers will adapt their programming by detecting the speed in which grass grows as needed to maintain a perfectly cut lawn, and some vacuum cleaning robots have dirt detectors that sense how much dirt is being picked up and use this information to tell them to stay in one area longer.

=== Task performance ===
The next step in autonomous behavior is to actually perform a physical task. A new area showing commercial promise is domestic robots, with a flood of small vacuuming robots beginning with [[iRobot]] and [[Electrolux]] in 2002. While the level of intelligence is not high in these systems, they navigate over wide areas and pilot in tight situations around homes using contact and non-contact sensors. Both of these robots use proprietary algorithms to increase coverage over simple random bounce.

The next level of autonomous task performance requires a robot to perform conditional tasks. For instance, security robots can be programmed to detect intruders and respond in a particular way depending upon where the intruder is.

=== Autonomous navigation ===

==== Indoor navigation ====

For a robot to associate behaviors with a place ([[robot localization|localization]]) requires it to know where it is and to be able to navigate point-to-point. Such navigation began with wire-guidance in the 1970s and progressed in the early 2000s to beacon-based [[triangulation]]. Current commercial robots autonomously navigate based on sensing natural features. The first commercial robots to achieve this were Pyxus' HelpMate hospital robot and the CyberMotion guard robot, both designed by robotics pioneers in the 1980s. These robots originally used manually created [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] floor plans, sonar sensing and wall-following variations to navigate buildings. The next generation, such as MobileRobots' [[PatrolBot]] and autonomous wheelchair,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.activrobots.com/ "Principal Investigator: W. Kennedy"], [[National Institutes of Health]], NIH SBIR 2 R44 HD041781-02&lt;/ref&gt; both introduced in 2004, have the ability to create their own laser-based maps of a building and to navigate open areas as well as corridors. Their control system changes its path on the fly if something blocks the way.

At first, autonomous navigation was based on planar sensors, such as laser range-finders, that can only sense at one level. The most advanced systems now fuse information from various sensors for both localization (position) and navigation. Systems such as Motivity can rely on different sensors in different areas, depending upon which provides the most reliable data at the time, and can re-map a building autonomously.

Rather than climb stairs, which requires highly specialized hardware, most indoor robots navigate handicapped-accessible areas, controlling elevators, and electronic doors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccsrobotics.com/speciminder.htm "Speci-Minder; see elevator and door access"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102053209/http://www.ccsrobotics.com/speciminder.htm |date=January 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With such electronic access-control interfaces, robots can now freely navigate indoors. Autonomously climbing stairs and opening doors manually are topics of research at the current time.

As these indoor techniques continue to develop, vacuuming robots will gain the ability to clean a specific user-specified room or a whole floor. Security robots will be able to cooperatively surround intruders and cut off exits. These advances also bring concomitant protections: robots' internal maps typically permit "forbidden areas" to be defined to prevent robots from autonomously entering certain regions.

==== Outdoor navigation ====

Outdoor autonomy is most easily achieved in the air, since obstacles are rare. [[Cruise missile]]s are rather dangerous highly autonomous robots. Pilotless drone aircraft are increasingly used for reconnaissance. Some of these [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs) are capable of flying their entire mission without any human interaction at all except possibly for the landing where a person intervenes using radio remote control. Some drones are capable of safe, automatic landings, however.  An autonomous ship was announced in 2014—the [[Autonomous spaceport drone ship]]—and is scheduled to make its first operational test in December 2014.&lt;ref name=nsf20141117&gt;
{{cite news |last1=Bergin|first1=Chris |title=Pad 39A – SpaceX laying the groundwork for Falcon Heavy debut |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/11/pad-39a-spacex-groundwork-falcon-heavy-debut/ |accessdate=2014-11-17 |work=NASA Spaceflight |date=2014-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2014|12}}

Outdoor autonomy is the most difficult for ground vehicles, due to:
* Three-dimensional terrain
* Great disparities in surface density
* Weather exigencies
* Instability of the sensed environment

[[Image:smSeekurMDARS.jpg|thumb|The Seekur and MDARS robots demonstrate their autonomous navigation and security capabilities at an airbase.]]
The Seekur robot was the first commercially available robot to demonstrate MDARS-like capabilities for general use by airports, utility plants, corrections facilities and [[Homeland Security]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,293390,00.html "Weapons Makers Unveil New Era of Counter-Terror Equipment"], Fox News&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mars rovers MER-A and MER-B (now known as [[Spirit rover]] and [[Opportunity rover]]) can find the position of the sun and navigate their own routes to destinations on the fly by:

* Mapping the surface with 3D vision
* Computing safe and unsafe areas on the surface within that field of vision
* Computing optimal paths across the safe area towards the desired destination
* Driving along the calculated route;
* Repeating this cycle until either the destination is reached, or there is no known path to the destination

The planned ESA Rover, ExoMars Rover, is capable of vision based relative localisation and absolute localisation to autonomously navigate safe and efficient trajectories to targets by:

* Reconstructing 3D models of the terrain surrounding the Rover using a pair of stereo cameras
* Determining safe and unsafe areas of the terrain and the general "difficulty" for the Rover to navigate the terrain
* Computing efficient paths across the safe area towards the desired destination
* Driving the Rover along the planned path
* Building up a navigation map of all previous navigation data

During the final NASA Sample Return Robot Centennial Challenge in 2016, a rover, named Cataglyphis, successfully demonstrated fully autonomous navigation, decision-making, and sample detection, retrieval, and return capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/centennial_challenges/feature/2016_sample_return_robot_challenge_award.html|title=NASA Awards $750K in Sample Return Robot Challenge|last=Hall|first=Loura|date=2016-09-08|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rover relied on a fusion of measurements from inertial sensors, wheel encoders, Lidar, and camera for navigation and mapping, instead of using GPS or magnetometers. During the 2 hour challenge, Cataglyphis traversed over 2.6&amp;nbsp;km and returned five different samples to its starting position.

The [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] and [[DARPA Urban Challenge]] have encouraged development of even more autonomous capabilities for ground vehicles, while this has been the demonstrated goal for aerial robots since 1990 as part of the AUVSI [[International Aerial Robotics Competition]].

Between 2013 and 2017, [[Total S.A.]] has held the [[ARGOS Challenge]] to develop the first autonomous robot for oil and gas production sites.

{{Expand section|date=July 2008}}
There are several open problems in autonomous robotics which are special to the field rather than being a part of the general pursuit of AI. According to George A. Bekey's ''Autonomous Robots: From Biological Inspiration to Implementation and Control'', problems include things such as making sure the robot is able to function correctly and not run into obstacles autonomously.

=== Energy autonomy and foraging ===
Researchers concerned with creating true [[artificial life]] are concerned not only with intelligent control, but further with the capacity of the robot to find its own resources through [[foraging]] (looking for [[food]], which includes both [[energy]] and spare parts).

This is related to '''autonomous foraging''', a concern within the [[science]]s of [[behavioral ecology]], [[social anthropology]], and [[human behavioral ecology]]; as well as [[robot]]ics, [[artificial intelligence]], and [[artificial life]].

== Delivery robot==
A delivery robot is an autonomous robot used for delivering goods. As of February 2017 there were several notable companies developing delivery robots (some with pilot deliveries in progress):

===Legislature===

In March 2016 a bill was introduced in Washington, D.C., allowing pilot ground robotic deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B21-0673 – Personal Delivery Device Act of 2016|url=http://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/B21-0673}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program was to take place from September 15 through the end of December 2017. The robots were limited to a weight of 50 pounds unloaded and maximum speed of 10 miles per hour. In case the robot stopped moving because of malfunction the company was required to remove it from the streets within 24 hours. There were allowed only 5 robots to be tested per company at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/06/24/its-official-drone-delivery-is-coming-to-d-c-in-september/|title=It’s official: Drone delivery is coming to D.C. in September|first=Brian|last=Fung|date=24 June 2016|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 version of the Personal Delivery Device Act bill was under review as of March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=B22-0019 – Personal Delivery Device Act of 2017|url=http://lims.dccouncil.us/Legislation/B22-0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017 a bill was passed in the US state of [[Virginia]] (the House bill, HB2016,&lt;ref&gt;https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=171&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=HB2016&lt;/ref&gt; and the Senate bill, SB1207&lt;ref&gt;https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?ses=171&amp;typ=bil&amp;val=SB1207&lt;/ref&gt;) that will allow autonomous delivery robots to travel on sidewalks and use crosswalks statewide beginning on July 1, 2017. The robots will be limited to a maximum speed of 10&amp;nbsp;mph and maximum weight of 50 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.recode.net/2017/3/1/14782518/virginia-robot-law-first-state-delivery-starship|title=Virginia is the first state to pass a law allowing robots to deliver straight to your door|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the states of Idaho and Florida there are also talks about passing similar legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktvb.com/news/local/capitol-watch/bill-allowing-robots-to-make-deliveries-heads-to-idaho-house/416300359|title=Could delivery robots be on their way to Idaho?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2017/01/25/florida-senator-proposes-rules-for-tiny-personal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been discussed that robots with similar characteristics to invalid carriages (e.g. 10&amp;nbsp;mph maximum, limited battery life) might be a workaround for certain classes of applications. If the robot was sufficiently intelligent and able to recharge itself using existing electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure it would only need minimal supervision and a single arm with low dexterity might be enough to enable this function if its visual systems had enough resolution.

In November 2017, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors announced that companies would need to get a city permit in order to test these robots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/san-francisco-just-put-the-brakes-on-delivery-robots/|title=San Francisco Just Put the Brakes on Delivery Robots|last=Simon|first=Matt|date=6 December 2017|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|access-date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, sidewalk delivery robots have been banned from making non-research deliveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sf.curbed.com/2017/12/6/16743326/san-francisco-delivery-robot-ban|title=San Francisco bans robots from most sidewalks|last=Brinklow|first=Adam|date=6 December 2017|work=[[Curbed]]|access-date=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1284">In [[geometric topology]], a '''band sum''' of two ''n''-dimensional knots ''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; along an (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional 1-handle ''h'' called a ''band''  is an ''n''-dimensional knot ''K'' such that:

* There is an (''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional 1-handle ''h'' connected to (''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) embedded in ''S''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+2&lt;/sup&gt;.
* There are points &lt;math&gt;p_1\in K_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p_2\in K_2&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is attached to &lt;math&gt;K_1\sqcup K_2&lt;/math&gt; along &lt;math&gt;p_1\sqcup p_2&lt;/math&gt;.

''K'' is the ''n''-dimensional knot obtained by this surgery.

A band sum is thus a generalization of the usual [[connected sum]] of knots.

'''[[Burmese name#Honorifics|Bo]] Mya''' ({{lang-my|ဘိုမြ}} {{IPA-my|bò mja̰|}}; born '''Htee Moo Kee'''; 20 January 1927 – 24 December 2006) was a [[Karen people|Karen]] rebel leader born in Papun District, which is in present-day [[Karen State]], [[Myanmar]]. He was a long-standing chairman of the [[Karen National Union]] (KNU), a political organisation of the [[Karen people]], from 1976 to 2000. He stepped down to become vice-chairman in 2004, and retired in 2004 from all public offices, due to poor health.

==Early career==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Bo Mya was among a significant number of Karens who joined the British — specifically in Bo Mya's case, Force 136 — during [[World War II]], with whom he fought the Japanese from the [[Dawna Range|East Dawna hills]] in 1944 to 1945.

After the Karens declared independence from Burma in 1949, Bo Mya quickly rose to a position of pre-eminence in the Karen movement, earning a reputation as a hard and ruthless operator. Based at [[Manerplaw]] ("victory field") close to the Thai-Burma border, the KNU under his control, and its military wing the [[Karen National Liberation Army]] (KNLA), was probably the most successful of the ethnic rebel organisations fighting [[Yangon|Rangoon]] in the [[Karen Conflict]] in the 1970s and 1980s.

==1990s==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
But by the mid-1990s, the tide was turning against him. A devout  [[Christianity|Christian]] of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], Bo Mya had always risked antagonising elements from within the predominantly [[Buddhism|Karen Buddhist]] and [[Animism|animist]] KNLA ranks. Although his defenders say he treated both Christians and Buddhists equally, the fact that the top positions of the KNU were filled almost entirely by Christians seemed to confirm the impression that he promoted the minority Christians' interests at the expense of those of the Buddhists and animists.

In late 1994, a group of KNLA soldiers broke away from the main army and formed the [[Democratic Karen Buddhist Army]] (DKBA). They allied themselves with the Burmese military, and led Burmese troops into Manerplaw in December 1994, leading to its capture — the biggest single setback to the Karens in their post-war history.

Since then, the KNU and KNLA's effectiveness has gradually diminished. This was demonstrated at the beginning of 2004 when Bo Mya travelled to [[Yangon]] (Rangoon), his first visit to the capital in 50 years, to hold peace talks with [[Khin Nyunt]], who was Prime Minister at the time.

==Death==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
{{Portal|Seventh-day Adventist Church|Christianity|Biography}}
On 24 December 2006, Bo Mya died in a hospital in [[Mae Sot]], [[Thailand]], near the eastern border of Myanmar. He had [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]] and was unable to walk for three years before his death.

'''''Brahmacharya''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|r|ɑː|m|ə|ˈ|tʃ|ɑr|j|ə}}; [[Devanagari]]: [[wikt:ब्रह्मचर्य|ब्रह्मचर्य]]) is a concept within [[Indian religions]] that literally means "conduct consistent with [[Brahma]]"&lt;ref&gt;James Lochtefeld, "Brahmacharya" in The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 1: A–M, pp. 120, Rosen Publishing. {{ISBN|9780823931798}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In one context, ''brahmacharya'' is the first of four ''[[ashrama (stage)|ashrama]]'' (age-based stages) of a human life, with ''[[grihastha]]'' (householder), ''[[vanaprastha]]'' (forest dweller), and ''[[sannyasa]]'' (renunciation) being the other three ''asramas''. The ''brahmacharya'' (bachelor student) stage of life – from childhood up to twenty-five years of age – was focused on education and included the practice of [[celibacy]].&lt;ref name=rks&gt;RK Sharma (1999), Indian Society, Institutions and Change, {{ISBN|978-8171566655}}, page 28&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, it connotes [[chastity]] during the student stage of life for the purposes of learning from a ''[[guru]]'' (teacher), and during later stages of life for the purposes of attaining spiritual liberation (Sanskrit: ''[[moksha]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Georg Feuerstein]], ''The Encyclopedia of Yoga and Tantra'', Shambhala Publications, {{ISBN|978-1590308790}}, 2011, pg 76, Quote – "Brahmacharya essentially stands for the ideal of chastity"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Johnson (2009), "The chaste and celibate state of a student of the ''Veda''", Oxford Dictionary of Hinduism, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-2713223273}}, pg 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In another context, ''brahmacharya'' is the [[virtue]] of celibacy when unmarried and [[fidelity]] when married.&lt;ref name=caf/&gt;&lt;ref name=brahmacarya2&gt;'''[a]''' Louise Taylor (2001), A Woman's Book of Yoga, Tuttle, {{ISBN|978-0804818292}}, page 3;&lt;br&gt;'''[b]'''Jeffrey Long (2009), Jainism: An Introduction, IB Tauris, {{ISBN|978-1845116262}}, page 109; Quote: The fourth vow – brahmacarya – means for laypersons, marital fidelity and pre-marital celibacy; for ascetics, it means absolute celibacy; John Cort explains, "Brahmacharya involves having sex only with one's spouse, as well as the avoidance of ardent gazing or lewd gestures (...) — Quoted by Long, ibid, page 101&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a virtuous lifestyle that also includes simple living, meditation and other behaviors.&lt;ref name=mkha/&gt;&lt;ref name=joseph/&gt;

In the Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist monastic traditions, ''brahmacharya'' implies, among other things, the mandatory renunciation of sex and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Carl Olson (2007), Celibacy and Religious Traditions, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195306323}}, page 227-233&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered necessary for a monk's spiritual practice.&lt;ref&gt;DR Pattanaik (1998), The Holy Refusal, MELUS, Vol. 23, No. 2, 113–127&lt;/ref&gt; Western notions of the religious life as practiced in monastic settings mirror these characteristics.

==Etymology==
The word ''brahmacharya'' stems from two Sanskrit roots:
#''[[Brahman]]'' is what god is called in the Vedas, the main Hindu scriptures.
#''charya'' (चर्य), which means "occupation with, engaging, proceeding, behaviour, conduct, to follow, going after".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/tamil/index.html carya] Monier Williams Sanskrit Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; This is often translated as activity, conduct, or mode of behaviour.

In ancient and medieval era Indian texts, the term ''brahmacharya'' is a concept with a more complex meaning indicating an overall lifestyle conducive to the pursuit of sacred knowledge and spiritual liberation.&lt;ref name=mkha/&gt; ''Brahmacharya'' is a means, not an end. It usually includes cleanliness, [[ahimsa]], simple living, studies, meditation, and voluntary restraints on certain foods, intoxicants, and behaviors (including sexual behavior).&lt;ref name=mkha&gt;M Khandelwal (2001), Sexual Fluids, Emotions, Morality – Notes on the Gendering of Brahmacharya, in Celibacy, Culture, and Society: The Anthropology of Sexual Abstinence (Editors: Elisa Sobo and Sandra Bell), University of Wisconsin Press, {{ISBN|978-0299171643}}, pages 157–174&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=joseph&gt;Joseph Alter (2012), Moral Materialism, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0143417415}}, pages 65–67&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a virtue==
''Brahmacharya'' is traditionally regarded as one of the five [[yamas]] in [[Yoga]], as declared in verse 2.30 of Patanjali's [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga Sutras]].&lt;ref&gt;Original:अहिंसासत्यास्तेय ब्रह्मचर्यापरिग्रहाः यमाः |&lt;br&gt;Source:{{cite book|last1=Āgāśe|first1=K.

For a married practitioner it means marital fidelity (not cheating on one's spouse); for a single person it means celibacy.&lt;ref name=caf&gt;[http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/himalayanacademy/sacredhinduliterature/lws/lws_ch-10.html Brahmacharyam Pativratyam cha – Celibacy and Fidelity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630071725/http://ebooks.gutenberg.us/himalayanacademy/sacredhinduliterature/lws/lws_ch-10.html |date=30 June 2013 }} Himalayan Academy, Gutenberg Archives (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brahmacarya2/&gt; Sandilya [[Upanishad]] includes ''brahmacharya'' as one of ten [[yamas]] in Chapter 1, defining it as "refraining from sexual intercourse in all places and in all states in mind, speech or body".&lt;ref&gt;KN Aiyar (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/thirtyminorupani00xxxxuoft#page/n189/mode/2up Sandilya Upanishad], Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Archives, page 173&lt;/ref&gt;

Patanjali in verse 2.38&lt;ref&gt;Original: ब्रह्मचर्य प्रतिष्ठायां वीर्यलाभः |&lt;br&gt;Source: [http://vedanta-yoga.de/yoga-sutras-yamas-ashtanga-ahimsa/ Yogasutra 2.35–2.39] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; states that the virtue of brahmacharya leads to the profit of ''virya'' (वीर्य).&lt;ref name=svb&gt;SV Bharti (2001), Yoga Sutras of Patanjali: With the Exposition of Vyasa, Motilal Banarsidas, {{ISBN|978-8120818255}}, Appendix I, pages 536–539&lt;/ref&gt; This Sanskrit word, ''virya'', has been variously translated as virility and, by [[Vyasa]], as strength and capacity. Vyasa explains that this virtue promotes other good qualities.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt; Other ancient and medieval era texts of Hinduism describe the fruits of this virtue differently. For example, Pada Chandrika, Raja Marttanda, Sutrartha Bodhini, Mani Prabha and Yoga Sudhakara each state that ''brahmacharya'' must be understood as the voluntary restraint of power.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt; [[Chandogya Upanishad]] in verses of chapter 8.5 extols ''brahmacharya'' as a sacrament and sacrifice which, once perfected, leads to realization of the soul or Self (Atman), and thereafter becomes the habit of experiencing the soul in others and everything.&lt;ref name=svb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/Shankara.Bhashya-Chandogya.Upanishad-Ganganath.Jha.1942.English#page/n449/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad] Book 8, Chapter 5, Jha (Translator), pages 434–440&lt;/ref&gt; Tattva Vaisharadi and Yoga Sarasangraha assert that ''brahmacharya'' leads to and increase in ''jñana-shakti'' (power of knowledge) and ''kriya-shakti'' (power of action).&lt;ref name=svb/&gt;

The great epic [[Mahabharata]] describes the objective of brahmacharya as knowledge of [[Brahman]] (Book Five, [[Udyoga Parva]], the Book of Effort).&lt;ref name=kmg/&gt; Brahmacharya leads one to union with the Supreme Soul or Self (Chapter 43). By subduing desire, the practice of self-restraint enables the student to learn, pay attention in [[Manasa, vacha, karmana|thought, word and deed]] to the ''guru'' (teacher), and discover the truth embodied in the Vedas and Upanishads. According to the epic, the practice of studying and learning requires the "aid of time," as well as personal effort, ability, discussion, and practice, all of which are helped by the virtue of brahmacharya.&lt;ref name=kmg/&gt; A brahmacharya should do useful work, and the earnings he obtains should be given away as ''dakshina'' ("fee," "gift of thanks") to the guru. The epic declares that brahmacharya is one of twelve virtues, an essential part of ''angas'' in [[yoga]] and the path of perfecting perseverance and the pursuit of knowledge.&lt;ref name=kmg&gt;KM Ganguli (Translator), {{Google books|OrpZAAAAMAAJ|The Mahabharata of Krishna-Dwaipayana Vyasa|page=150}}, Udyoga Parva, Chapter 43, pages 150–153&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Jainism ==
[[File:In-jain.svg|alt=Jain Flag Photo|thumb|Green colour in the [[Jain flag]] stands for ''brahmacharya''{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2012|p=iv}}]]
''Brahmacharya'' is one of the five major vows prescribed for the ''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|śrāvakā]]'' (layman) and ascetics in [[Jainism]]. For those Jains who adopt the path of monks, celibacy in action, words and thoughts is expected. For lay Jains who are married, the virtue of ''brahmacharya'' requires remaining sexually faithful to one's chosen partner.&lt;ref name=pshah/&gt; For lay Jains who are unmarried, chaste living requires Jains to avoid sex before marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Brahmacarya |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/living/brahmacarya.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Uttam Brahmacharya'' (Supreme Celibacy) is one of the ten excellencies of a ''[[Digambara monk]]''.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1926|p=64}} ''Brahmacharya'' is mentioned as one of the ''das [[Dharma (Jainism)|dharma]]'' (ten virtues) in ancient Jain texts like ''[[Tattvartha Sutra]]'', ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]'' and ''[[Puruşārthasiddhyupāya]]''.{{sfn|Vijay K.

==Among Sramanic traditions==
Among the [[sramana|sramanic traditions]] ([[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Ājīvika]] and Carvaka schools ), ''brahmacharya'' is the term used for a self-imposed practice of celibacy generally considered a prerequisite for [[sadhana|spiritual practice]]. The fourth of the five great vows of [[Jain monk]]s, for example, is the vow of celibacy, which in this case means a total abstinence from the sensual pleasure of all five senses, including the avoidance of sexual thoughts and desires.&lt;ref name=pshah&gt;Pravin Shah, [http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~pluralsm/affiliates/jainism/jainedu/5greatvows.htm Five Great Vows (Maha-vratas) of Jainism] Jainism Literature Center, Harvard University Archives (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kolb (2007), Encyclopedia of Business Ethics and Society, SAGE Publications, {{ISBN|978-1412916523}}, page 1207-1208&lt;/ref&gt; The [[yogin]] who is firmly grounded in the virtue of ''brahmacharya'' is said to gain great vitality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Shambhala Encyclopedia of Yoga|page= 61|author=Georg Feuerstein|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i7yoPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Shambhala+Encyclopedia+of+Yoga%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2wynVP6sDpCDNvTggOAM&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As Asrama stage of life==
{{Main|Ashrama (stage)}}
Historically ''brahmacarya'' referred to a stage of life ''(asrama)'' within the [[Vedic ashram system]]. Ancient [[Hindu culture]] divided the human lifespan into four stages: ''Brahmacharya'', ''[[Grihastha]]'', ''[[Vanaprastha]]'' and ''[[Sannyasa]]''. ''Brahamacharya asrama'' occupied the first 20–25 years of life roughly corresponding to adolescence.&lt;ref&gt;Manusmriti suggests the Brahmacharya ashrama be about 25 years, one fourth of the normal life of human being he estimates to be 100 years. See: RK Sharma (1999), Indian Society, Institutions and Change, {{ISBN|978-8171566655}}, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bodhinatha Veylanswami (2007), What Is Hinduism?, Editors of Hinduism Today, Himalayan Academy Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1934145005}}, page 372&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the child's ''[[Upanayanam]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Vivekjivandas, Sadhu. ''Hinduism: An Introduction&amp;nbsp;– Part 2''. (Swaminarayan Aksharpith: Ahmedabad, 2010) p. 113. {{ISBN|978-81-7526-434-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the young person would begin a life of study in the [[Gurukula]] (the household of the [[Guru]]) dedicated to learning all aspects of ''dharma'' that is the "principles of righteous living". ''Dharma'' comprised personal responsibilities towards himself, family, society, humanity and God which included the environment, earth and nature. This educational period started when the child was five to eight years old and lasted until the age of 14 to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Rocher, Ludo. "The Dharmaśāstas". ''The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism''.(Ed.Gavin Flood) (Blackwell Publishing Ltd.: Oxford, 2003) p. 103. {{ISBN|0-631-21535-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this stage of life, the traditional [[Vedanga|vedic sciences]] and various sastras&lt;ref&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1958), Traditions of the Indian Craftsman, The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 71, No. 281, Traditional India: Structure and Change (Jul. – Sep., 1958), pp. 224–230&lt;/ref&gt; were studied along with the religious texts contained within the [[Vedas]] and [[Upanishads]].&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Parker (1987), Artistic practice and education in India: A historical overview, Journal of Aesthetic Education, pp 123–141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Misra, R.

Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad suggests that Brahmacharya (student) stage of life should extend from the age a child is ready to receive teachings from a ''guru'', and continue for a period of twelve years.&lt;ref&gt;KN Aiyar (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/thirtyminorupani00xxxxuoft#page/n151/mode/2up Narada Parivrajaka Upanishad], Thirty Minor Upanishads, University of Toronto Archives, page 135&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical references to Brahmacharya==
The Vedas discuss Brahmacharya, both in the context of lifestyle and stage of one's life. [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], for example, in Book 10 Chapter 136, mentions knowledge seekers as those with ''Kesin'' (long haired) and soil-colored clothes (yellow, orange, saffron) engaged in the affairs of ''Mananat'' (mind, meditation).&lt;ref&gt;GS Ghurye (1952), Ascetic Origins, Sociological Bulletin, Vol. 1, No. 2, pages 162–184;&lt;br&gt;For original: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.१३६ Rigveda] Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt; Rigveda, however, refers to these people as ''Muni'' and ''Vati''. The [[Atharva Veda]], completed by about 1000 BC, has more explicit discussion of ''Brahmacharya'', in Book XI Chapter 5.&lt;ref name=atharvaveda&gt;For source in Sanskrit: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/अथर्ववेदः/अथर्ववेद:_काण्डं_11 Atharva Veda] Wikisource, Hymns 11.5[7].1 – 11.5[7].26; ('''ब्रह्मचारी'''ष्णंश् चरति रोदसी उभे तस्मिन् देवाः संमनसो भवन्ति | स दाधार पृथिवीं दिवं च स आचार्यं तपसा पिपर्ति ||1|| '''ब्रह्मचारिणं''' पितरो देवजनाः पृथग् देवा अनुसंयन्ति सर्वे | गन्धर्वा एनम् अन्व् आयन् त्रयस्त्रिंशत् त्रिशताः षट्सहस्राः सर्वान्त् स देवांस् तपसा पिपर्ति ||2|| आचार्य उपनयमानो '''ब्रह्मचारिणं''' कृणुते गर्भम् अन्तः | तं रात्रीस् तिस्र उदरे बिभर्ति तं जातं द्रष्टुम् अभिसंयन्ति देवाः ||3|| (...))&lt;br&gt; For English translation: Stephen N Hay and William Theodore De Bary (1988), Sources of Indian Tradition, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120804678}}, pages 18–19&lt;/ref&gt; This Chapter of Atharva Veda describes Brahmacharya as that which leads to one's second birth (mind, Self-awareness), with Hymn 11.5.3 painting a symbolic picture that when a teacher accepts a Brahmachari, the student becomes his embryo.&lt;ref name=atharvaveda/&gt;

The concept and practice of ''Brahmacarya'' is extensively found among the older strata of the [[Mukhya Upanishads]] in Hinduism. The 8th century BC text [[Chandogya Upanishad]] describes in Book 8, activities and lifestyle that is Brahmacharya:&lt;ref name=sscu&gt;Translation: S Swahananda (2010), Chandogya Upanishad, Vedanta Press, {{ISBN|978-8171203307}}, Book VIII, Chapter 5, verse 1–4&lt;br&gt;Original: अथ यद्यज्ञ इत्याचक्षते '''ब्रह्मचर्य'''मेव तद्ब्रह्मचर्येण | ह्येव यो ज्ञाता तं विन्दतेऽथ यदिष्टमित्याचक्षते | '''ब्रह्मचर्य'''मेव तद्ब्रह्मचर्येण ह्येवेष्ट्वात्मानमनुविन्दते ॥ १ ॥ अथ यत्सत्त्रायणमित्याचक्षते '''ब्रह्मचर्य'''मेव तद्ब्रह्मचर्येण | ह्येव सत आत्मनस्त्राणं विन्दतेऽथ यन्मौनमित्याचक्षते |

{{quote|Now what people call ''[[Yajna|yajña]]'' (sacrifice) is really ''Brahmacharya'', for only by means of Brahmacharya does the knower attain that world (of Brahman). And what people call ''Ishta'' (worship) is really Brahmacharya, for only worshipping by means of Brahmacarya does one attain the Atman (the liberated Self). Now, what people call the ''Sattrayana'' (sacrificial session) is really Brahmacharya, for only by means of Brahmacharya does one obtain one's salvation from ''Sat'' (Being). And what people call the ''Mauna'' (vow of silence) is really Brahmacharya for only through Brahmacharya does one understand the Atman and then meditate. Now, what people call a ''Anasakayana'' (vow of fasting) is really Brahmacharya, for this Atman never perishes which one attains by means of Brahmacharya. And what people call the ''Aranyayana'' (life of a hermit) is really Brahmacharya, for the world of [[Brahman]] belongs to those who by means of Brahmacharya attain the seas Ara and Nya in the world of Brahman.

A hymn in another early Upanishad, the [[Mundaka Upanishad]] in Book 3, Chapter 1 similarly states,
{{quote|

Through continuous pursuit of [[Satya]] (truthfulness), [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|Tapas]] (perseverance, austerity), ''Samyajñāna'' (correct knowledge), and ''Brahmacharya'', one attains [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] (the Self, soul).|Mundaka Upanishad|III.1.5&lt;ref&gt;MP Pandit (1969), Mundaka Upanishad 3.1.5, Gleanings from the Upanishads, {{oclc|81579}}, University of Virginia Archives, pages 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Vedas and early Upanishadic texts of Hinduism in their discussion of Brahmacharya, make no mention of the age of the student at the start of Brahmacharya,&lt;ref&gt;Some recent [[Upanishad]]s do, see for example Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad mentioned below&lt;/ref&gt; nor any restraint on sexual activity. One of the earliest discussion and contrasting viewpoints on sexual intercourse during ''Brahmacharya'' is in section 11.5.4 of [[Shatapatha Brahmana|Satpatha Brahamana]]. The verses 11.5.4.16 and 11.5.4.17 present two different viewpoints on sexual activity, one against and one as a choice.&lt;ref name=julius&gt;Julius Eggeling, [https://archive.org/stream/satapathabrhman01eggegoog#page/n143/mode/2up Satapatha Brahmana] Madhyandina School version, Clarendon Press, Oxford, page 90&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in verse 11.5.4.18, the Satapatha Brahamana presents contrasting viewpoints on an eating restraint for the Brahmachari.&lt;ref name=julius/&gt;

The '''Causal body''' - originally '''''Karana-Sarira''''' - is a [[Yoga|Yogic]] and [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] concept that was adopted and modified by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and from the latter made its way into the general [[New Age]] movement and contemporary western [[esotericism]]. It generally refers to the highest or innermost body that veils the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]] or true [[Soul (spirit)|soul]].

==Hinduism==
{{Main|Three Bodies Doctrine}}
{{See also|Eight Consciousnesses#Ālayavijñānas|l1=Ālayavijñānas}}

''Karana sarira'' or the causal body is the cause{{sfn|Sharma|2006|p=193}} or seed of the subtle body and the gross body. It has no other function than being the seed of the subtle and the gross body.{{sfn|Bahder|Bahder|2013}} It is ''nirvikalpa [[Rūpa|rupam]]'', "undifferentiated form".{{sfn|Bahder|Bahder|2013}} It originates with ''[[Advaita vedanta#Avidyā|avidya]]'', "ignorance" or "nescience" of the real identity of the atman, instead giving birth to the notion of ''[[jiva]]-bhuta''.

[[Swami Sivananda]] characterizes the causal body as "The beginningless ignorance that is indescribable".&lt;ref group=web name="BV" /&gt; [[Siddharameshwar Maharaj]], the guru of [[Nisargadatta Maharaj]], also describes the causal body as characterized by "emptiness", "ignorance" and "darkness".{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|31-32}} In the search for the "I am", this is a state where there is nothing to hold on to anymore.{{sfn|Siddharameshwar Maharaj|2009|31-32}}{{refn|group=note|name="kenosis"|Compare [[kenosis]] and Juan de la Cross' ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]''.}}

[[Ramanuja]] concludes that it is at this stage that consummation of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]] with the [[Paramatman]] is reached and the search of the highest [[Purusa]] i.e. of [[Ishvara]] ends.{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=155–168}} 

According to other philosophical schools the causal body is not the ''atman'', because it also has a beginning and an end and is subject to modification.&lt;ref group=web&gt;{{cite web|title=Tattva Bodha of Adi Shankara Part 2|author=Dr. S. Yegnasubramanian|url=http://svbf.org/journal/vol3no4/bodha.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], not seeking a personal god, goes beyond ''Anandamaya Kosha'' in search of the transcendent [[Brahman]].{{sfn|Ranade|1926|p=155–168}}

The Indian tradition identifies it with the ''[[Anandamaya kosha]]'',&lt;ref group=web name="BV"&gt;[http://sivanandaonline.org/public_html/?cmd=displaysection&amp;section_id=774 Divine life Society, ''Bases of Vedanta'']&lt;/ref&gt; and the deep sleep state, as mentioned in the [[Mandukya Upanishad]], where ''buddhi'' becomes dormant and all concepts of time fail, although there differences between these three descriptions.

==Theosophy==
In [[Blavatsky]]'s synthesis of [[eastern philosophy]] with western [[esotericism]], the union of the higher [[Manas (Theosophy)|Manas]] with the [[Buddhi (Theosophy)|Buddhi]] (i.e. the essential nature of the fifth, along with the sixth, of the [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven principles]]) is referred to as the Causal Body (Blavatsky, ''Key to Theosophy'', pp.&amp;nbsp;121, 174). This higher principle is contrasted with the lower, the ''[[Kama-Manas]]'', which is the seat of lower passions.
In the Theosophy of [[Annie Besant]] and [[C. W. Leadbeater]], the "Causal Body" refers not to the "Buddhi-Manas" but to Blavatsky's "Higher Manas" alone. This is also referred to as the "Higher Mental", "Abstract Mind" (as opposed to Lower Mental or "Concrete Mind"), or "Causal Body". It is considered the highest [[subtle body]], beyond even the [[mental body]]. As with all the vehicles of consciousness, the Causal Body is associated with an objective or cosmic plane, in this case the [[Causal plane]]. A detailed definition of the Causal Body, is provided by A. E. Powell, who has brought together information in the works of Besant and Leadbeater in a series of books on each of the subtle bodies.

==Samael Aun Weor==
In the tradition of [[Samael Aun Weor]] it is taught that most people have only incarnated a fraction of the causal body or human soul. This fraction is known as the Essence or the [[Buddha-nature|Buddhata]], which in humanity is bottled up in the psychological aggregates that constitute the ego. Samael Aun Weor states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, the various aggregates that are within ourselves represent different volitional impulses. There are, therefore, several wills within our psyche which fight against each other. The intellectual animal doesn’t have any autonomous, independent and unitotal will. There is no unity in the intellectual animal’s willpower. But when a man has created his Body of Conscious Will [causal body], he has individual willpower he can work with in the whole universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The way to create the causal body is by working in the "Forge of Cyclops", that is, [[Sex magic#Samael Aun Weor|sexual alchemy]] between husband and wife.

{{Rights |Human}}

'''Civil and political rights''' are a class of [[rights]] that protect [[individual]]s' [[political freedom|freedom]] from infringement by [[government]]s, [[social organization]]s, and private individuals. They ensure one's ability to participate in the civil and political life of the society and [[State (polity)|state]] without [[discrimination]] or [[Political repression|repression]].

Civil rights include the ensuring of peoples' physical and mental [[integrity]], [[right to life|life]], and [[safety]]; protection from discrimination on grounds such as [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[gender]], [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[national origin]], [[human skin color|color]], [[ageing|age]], [[Political party|political affiliation]], [[ethnicity]], [[religion]], and [[disability]];&lt;ref&gt;The Civil Rights act of 1964, [http://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=97 ourdocuments.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, [http://www.access-board.gov/about/laws/ada.htm accessboard.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Summary of LGBT civil rights protections, by state, at Lambda Legal, [http://www.lambdalegal.org/states-regions/ lambdalegal.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[individual rights]] such as [[privacy]] and the freedoms of [[freedom of thought|thought]], [[freedom of speech|speech]], [[freedom of religion|religion]], [[freedom of the press|press]], [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], and [[freedom of movement|movement]].

Political rights include [[natural justice]] (procedural fairness) in [[law]], such as the [[rights of the accused]], including the [[right to a fair trial]]; [[due process]]; the right to seek redress or a [[legal remedy]]; and rights of [[Participation (decision making)|participation]] in [[civil society]] and [[politics]] such as [[freedom of association]], the [[right to assemble]], the [[right to petition]], the [[right of self-defense]], and the [[Suffrage|right to vote]].

Civil and political rights form the original and main part of international [[human rights]].&lt;ref&gt;A useful survey is Paul Sieghart, ''The Lawful Rights of Mankind: An Introduction to the International Legal Code of Human Rights'', Oxford University Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; They comprise the first portion of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (with [[economic, social, and cultural rights]] comprising the second portion). The theory of [[three generations  of human rights]] considers this group of rights to be "first-generation rights", and the theory of [[negative and positive rights]] considers them to be generally [[negative rights]].

==History==
The phrase "Rights for Civil" is a translation of Latin ''ius civis'' (rights of a citizen). Roman citizens could be either free (''libertas'') or servile (''servitus''), but they all had rights in law.&lt;ref&gt;Mears, T. Lambert, ''Analysis of M. Ortolan's Institutes of Justinian, Including the History and'', p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, these rights included the freedom of religion; however in 380, the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] required all subjects of the Roman Empire to profess Catholic Christianity.&lt;ref name="Fahlbusch"&gt;Fahlbusch, Erwin and Geoffrey William Bromiley, ''The encyclopedia of Christianity'', Volume 4, p. 703.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman legal doctrine was lost during the Middle Ages, but claims of universal rights could still be made based on Christian doctrine. According to the leaders of [[Kett's Rebellion]] (1549), "all bond men may be made free, for God made all free with his precious blood-shedding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/humanrights/1500-1760/ |title=Human Rights: 1500-1760 - Background |publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[English common law]] judge Sir [[Edward Coke]] revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that Englishmen had historically enjoyed [[Rights of Englishmen|such rights]]. The [[Parliament of England]] adopted the [[English Bill of Rights]] in 1689. It was one of the influences drawn on by [[George Mason]] and [[James Madison]] when drafting the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]] in 1776. The Virginia declaration is the direct ancestor and model for the [[U.S. Bill of Rights]] (1789).

The removal by legislation of a civil right constitutes a "civil disability". In early 19th century Britain, the phrase "civil rights" most commonly referred to the issue of such legal discrimination against Catholics. In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] support for civil rights was divided, with many  politicians agreeing with the existing civil disabilities of Catholics. The [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]] restored their civil rights.

In the 1860s, Americans adapted this usage to newly freed blacks. [[United States Congress|Congress]] enacted [[Civil Rights Act (disambiguation)|civil rights acts]] in [[Civil Rights Act of 1866|1866]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1871|1871]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1875|1875]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1957|1957]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1960|1960]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|1964]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1968|1968]], and [[Civil Rights Act of 1991|1991]].

==Protection of rights==
[[T. H. Marshall]] notes that civil rights were among the first to be recognized and codified, followed later by political rights and still later by social rights. In many countries, they are [[constitutional right]]s and are included in a [[bill of rights]] or similar document. They are also defined in [[international human rights instruments]], such as the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the 1967 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]].

Civil and political rights need not be codified to be protected, although most [[Democracy|democracies]] worldwide do have formal written guarantees of civil and political rights. Civil rights are considered to be [[Natural and legal rights|natural rights]]. [[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote in his ''[[A Summary View of the Rights of British America]]'' that "a free people [claim] their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their [[chief magistrate]]."

The question of to whom civil and political rights apply is a subject of controversy. In many countries, [[citizen]]s have greater protections against infringement of rights than non-citizens; at the same time, civil and political rights are generally considered to be universal rights that apply to all [[person]]s.

According to political scientist Salvador Santino F. Regilme Jr., analyzing the causes of and lack of protection from human rights abuses in the Global South should be focusing on the interactions of domestic and international factors—an important perspective that has usually been systematically neglected in the social science literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Regilme |first=Salvador Santino F., Jr. |date=3 October 2014 |title=The Social Science of Human Rights: The Need for a 'Second Image Reversed'? |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01436597.2014.946255 |work=[[Third World Quarterly]] |volume=35 |issue=8 |pages=1390–1405 |doi=10.1080/01436597.2014.946255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other rights==
[[Custom (law)|Custom]] also plays a role. Implied or [[unenumerated rights]] are rights that [[court]]s may find to exist even though not expressly guaranteed by written law or custom; one example is the [[right to privacy]] in the [[United States]], and the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] explicitly shows that there are other rights that are also protected.

The [[United States Declaration of Independence]] states that people have unalienable rights including "Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness". It is considered by some that the sole purpose of government is the protection of life, liberty and property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb4.htm House Bill 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001010710/http://www1.legis.ga.gov/legis/2011_12/fulltext/hb4.htm |date=2012-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social movements for civil rights==
{{Main article|Movements for civil rights}}

[[File:Savka Dabcevic Kucar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Savka Dabčević-Kučar]], [[Croatian Spring]] participant; Europe's first female prime minister]]

Civil rights guarantee equal protection under the law. When civil and political rights are not guaranteed to all as part of equal protection of [[law]]s, or when such guarantees exist on paper but are not respected in practice, opposition, legal action and even [[social unrest]] may ensue.

Some historians suggest that [[New Orleans]] was the cradle of the civil rights movement in the United States, due to the earliest efforts of Creoles to integrate the military ''en masse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Fernin|title=Louisiana's Free People of Color-Digitization Grant-letter in support|url=https://www.academia.edu/3505760/Louisianas_Free_People_of_Color-Digitization_grant_awarded_to_LSU_Hill_library_others|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; W.C.C. Claiborne, appointed by Thomas Jefferson to be governor of the Territory of Orleans, formally accepted delivery of the French colony on December 20, 1803. Free men of colour had been members of the militia for decades under both Spanish and French control of the colony of Louisiana. They volunteered their services and pledged their loyalty to Claiborne and to their newly adopted country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=Clarence|title=The Territorial Papers of the United States, Vol. IX, The Territory of Orleans|year=1940|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, in early 1804, the new U.S. administration in New Orleans, under Governor Claiborne, was faced with a dilemma previously unknown in the United States, i.e., the integration of the military by incorporating entire units of previously established "colored" militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eaton|first=Fernin|title=1811 Slave Uprising, etc|url=https://www.academia.edu/1910804/Gov._Claiborne_in_his_own_words--a_salon_publique_at_Pitot_House_Bayou_St._John|work=Salon Publique, Pitot House, November 7, 2011|accessdate=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; See, e.g., the February 20, 1804 letter to Claiborne from Secretary of War Henry Dearborn that "it would be prudent not to increase the Corps, but to diminish, if it could be done without giving offense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rowland|first=Dunbar|title=Official Letter Books of W.C.C.

Civil rights movements in the United States gathered steam by 1848 with such documents as the Declaration of Sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;"Signatures to the Seneca Falls Convention 'Declaration of Sentiments{{'"}}. American History Online, Facts On File, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=March 2014}} Consciously modeled after the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the [[Declaration of Rights and Sentiments]] became the founding document of the American women's movement, and it was adopted at the Seneca Falls Convention, July 19 and 20, 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Cullen-DuPont, Kathryn.

Worldwide, several [[political movement]]s for [[equality before the law]] occurred between approximately 1950 and 1980. These movements had a legal and constitutional aspect, and resulted in much law-making at both national and international levels. They also had an activist side, particularly in situations where violations of rights were widespread. Movements with the proclaimed aim of securing observance of civil and political rights included:

* the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States, where rights of black citizens had been violated;
* the [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]], formed in 1967 following failures in this province of the [[United Kingdom]] to respect the Roman Catholic minority's rights; and
* movements in many Communist countries, such as the [[Prague Spring]] and [[Charter 77]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] and the uprisings in Hungary.

Most civil rights movements relied on the technique of [[civil resistance]], using [[nonviolent]] methods to achieve their aims.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Roberts (scholar)|Adam Roberts]] and [[Timothy Garton Ash]] (eds.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BxOQKrCe7UUC&amp;dq=Civil+resistance+and+power+politics&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Civil Resistance and Power Politics: The Experience of Non-violent Action from Gandhi to the Present''], Oxford University Press, 2009. Includes chapters by specialists on the various movements.&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, struggles for civil rights were accompanied, or followed, by [[civil unrest]] and even armed rebellion. While civil rights movements over the last sixty years have resulted in an extension of civil and political rights, the process was long and tenuous in many countries, and many of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.

==Problems and analysis==
Questions about civil and political rights have frequently emerged. For example, to what extent should the government intervene to protect individuals from infringement on their rights by other [[individual]]s, or from [[corporation]]s—e.g., in what way should [[employment discrimination]] in the [[private sector]] be dealt with?

[[Political theory]] deals with civil and political rights. [[Robert Nozick]] and [[John Rawls]] expressed competing visions in Nozick's ''[[Anarchy, State, and Utopia]]'' and Rawls' ''[[A Theory of Justice]]''. Other influential authors in the area include [[Wesley Newcomb Hohfeld]], and [[Jean Edward Smith]].

==First-generation rights==
First-generation rights, often called "purple" rights, deal essentially with liberty and participation in political life. They are fundamentally civil and political in nature, as well as strongly [[individual and group rights|individualistic]]: They serve [[negative and positive rights|negatively to protect]] the individual from excesses of the state. First-generation rights include, among other things, [[freedom of speech]], the [[right to a fair trial]], (in some countries) the [[right to keep and bear arms]], [[freedom of religion]] and [[voting rights]]. They were pioneered in the [[United States]] by the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] and in [[France]] by the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in the 18th century, although some of these rights and the right to due process date back to the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 and the [[Rights of Englishmen]], which were expressed in the [[English Bill of Rights]] in 1689.

They were enshrined at the global level and given status in [[international law]] first by Articles 3 to 21 of the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and later in the 1966 [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]. In Europe, they were enshrined in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] in 1953.

The civil rights movement was a struggle for social justice that took place mainly during the 1950s and 1960s for blacks to gain equal rights under the law in the United States. In 1868, the  14th amendment to the constitution gave blacks equal protection under the law.
In the 1960s, Americans who knew only the potential of "equal protection of the laws" expected the president, the Congress, and the courts to fulfill the promise of the 14th Amendment.

In the United States, '''civil confinement''' is a term for the formal legal process by which persons convicted of certain sexual offenses (generally violent [[sex offender]]s) may be subject to [[involuntary commitment]] upon completion of a prison sentence.

== Legal process ==

Although the exact details of the legal process may vary from state to state, the [[United States Supreme Court]] reviewed and upheld as constitutional a statutory process adopted in Kansas. See ''[[Kansas v. Hendricks]]'', 521 U.S. 346 (1997). There, civil confinement proceedings could be initiated against "any person who has been convicted of or charged with a sexually violent offense and who suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder which makes the person likely to engage in the predatory acts of sexual violence." Many of those terms were themselves defined in the statute, including "mental abnormality," defined as "congenital or acquired condition affecting the emotional or volitional capacity which predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses in a degree constituting such person a menace to the health and safety of others." ''Id''.

If a prison identified an inmate who was about to be released but potentially fit this definition, the prison authorities were required to notify the local prosecutor of the impending release. The prosecutor was then required to decide whether to petition for commitment. The court would then have to determine whether probable cause existed to support the inmate's status as a "sexually violent predator," and, upon such a determination, order the inmate to be psychologically evaluated. The psychological evaluation would then form the basis of a further trial to determine whether the inmate qualified as a violent sexual predator. Upon such a determination, the inmate would be subject to involuntary commitment at a medical facility until such time as his mental abnormality had changed and it was safe to release him.'' Id''. at 353. The court would then be required to conduct an annual review of the determination, and the inmate would always be allowed to petition for freedom under the same standards. The Supreme Court concluded that this process met previously established standards of constitutional [[substantive due process]] governing voluntary confinement, did not constitute [[double jeopardy]] because the proceedings were civil rather than criminal, and was not an ex post facto law for the same reason. ''Id''. at 353-371. In a following case, the United States Supreme Court clarified that the government must demonstrate that the inmate has at least a serious lack of ability to control his behavior. ''[[Kansas v. Crane]]'' 534 U.S. 407 (2002). The Supreme Court has also determined that Congress has the authority to pass a similar law affecting federal prisoners. ''[[United States v. Comstock]]'', 560 U.S. 126 (2010).

Twenty states have civil commitment facilities, as of 2018.&lt;ref name=mail &gt;{{cite news

== Controversy ==

As with [[civil commitment]] generally, civil confinement is a controversial implementation of state power. Detractors point to the prospect of indefinite detention without due process of law.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., David Rosen, "Sex Offenders, Civil Confinement and the Resurrection of Evil: The New Disappeared," May 10, 2007, [http://www.counterpunch.org/rosen05102007.html Counterpunch] ("Civil confinement permits the state to transform a criminal sentence with a specified duration into an indeterminate life sentence.") Accessed January 24, 2008; Mark K. Matthews, "Molesters confined even after jail time is up" [http://www.stateline.org/live/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=136&amp;languageId=1&amp;contentId=87312 State Line] ("When the most dangerous sexual predators are due to leave prison ... officials can revoke their freedom and toss them into mental hospitals indefinitely.") Accessed January 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents cite public safety.&lt;ref&gt;E.g., Don Esmonde, "No mercy due 100-year-old pedophile," December 13, 2009, [http://www.buffalonews.com/donnesmonde/story/892797.html The Buffalo News]. Accessed December 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

State legislatures who have decided to adopt civil confinement statutes have expressed the intent of the laws in their enactments. One example is the state of Washington, which explained:

:The legislature finds that a small but extremely dangerous group of sexually violent predators exist who do not have a mental disease or defect that renders them appropriate for the existing involuntary treatment act . . . which is intended to be a short-term civil commitment system that is primarily designed to provide short-term treatment to individuals with serious mental disorders and then return them to the community. In contrast to persons appropriate for civil commitment . . . sexually violent predators generally have personality disorders and/or mental abnormalities which are unamenable to existing mental illness treatment modalities and those conditions render them likely to engage in sexually violent behavior. The legislature further finds that sex offenders' likelihood of engaging in repeat acts of predatory sexual violence is high. The existing involuntary commitment act . . . is inadequate to address the risk to reoffend because during confinement these offenders do not have access to potential victims and therefore they will not engage in an overt act during confinement as required by the involuntary treatment act for continued confinement. The legislature further finds that the prognosis for curing sexually violent offenders is poor, the treatment needs of this population are very long term, and the treatment modalities for this population are very different than the traditional treatment modalities for people appropriate for commitment under the involuntary treatment act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=71.09.010 RCW 70.09.010].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Docking states==
A docking/berthing connection is referred to as either "soft" or "hard". Typically, a spacecraft first initiates a ''soft dock'' by making contact and latching its docking connector with that of the target vehicle. Once the soft connection is secured, if both spacecraft are pressurized, they may proceed to a ''hard dock'' where the docking mechanisms form an airtight seal, enabling interior hatches to be safely opened so that crew and cargo can be transferred.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2018}} 
[[File:Gemini 8 docking.jpg|thumb| The first spacecraft docking was performed between [[Gemini 8]] and an unmanned [[Agena Target Vehicle]] on March 16, 1966.]]
Spacecraft docking capability depends on [[space rendezvous]], the ability of two spacecraft to find each other and [[orbital station-keeping|station-keep in the same orbit]]. This was first developed by the United States for [[Project Gemini]]. It was planned for the crew of [[Gemini 6A|Gemini 6]] to rendezvous and manually dock under the command of [[Wally Schirra]], with an unmanned [[Agena Target Vehicle]] in October 1965, but the Agena vehicle exploded during launch. On the revised mission Gemini 6A, Schirra successfully performed a rendezvous in December 1965 with the manned [[Gemini 7]], approaching to within one foot, but there was no docking capability between two Gemini spacecraft. The first docking with an Agena was successfully performed under the command of [[Neil Armstrong]] on [[Gemini 8]] on March 16, 1966. Manual dockings were performed on three subsequent Gemini missions in 1966.

The [[Apollo program]] depended on [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] to achieve its objective of landing men on the Moon. This required first a [[transposition, docking, and extraction]] maneuver between the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] (CSM) mother spacecraft and the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) landing spacecraft, shortly after both craft were sent out of Earth orbit on a path to the Moon. Then after completing the lunar landing mission, two astronauts in the LM had to rendezvous and dock with the CSM in lunar orbit, in order to be able to return to Earth. The spacecraft were designed to permit intra-vehicular crew transfer through a tunnel between the nose of the Command Module and the roof of the Lunar Module. These maneuvers were first demonstrated in [[low Earth orbit]] on March 7, 1969, on [[Apollo 9]], then in lunar orbit in May 1969 on [[Apollo 10]], then in six lunar landing missions.

Unlike the United States, which used manual piloted docking throughout the Apollo and [[Space Shuttle]] programs, the Soviet Union employed automated docking systems from the beginning of its docking attempts. The first such system, [[Igla (spacecraft docking system)|Igla]], was successfully tested on October 30, 1967 when the two uncrewed [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] test vehicles [[Kosmos 186]] and [[Kosmos 188]] docked automatically in orbit.&lt;ref name=MirHH&gt;{{cite web |title=Mir Hardware Heritage Part 1: Soyuz |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/documentation/mhh/mirhh-part1.pdf |publisher=NASA |accessdate=3 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226011559/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/documentation/mhh/mirhh-part1.pdf |archivedate=26 December 2017 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niitp.ru/en/directions/02/history/ |accessdate=June 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424051917/http://www.niitp.ru/en/directions/02/history/ |archivedate=April 24, 2008|title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first successful Soviet docking. Proceeding to manned docking attempts, the Soviet Union first achieved rendezvous of [[Soyuz 3]] with the unmanned [[Soyuz 2]] craft on October 25, 1968; docking was unsuccessfully attempted. The first manned Soviet docking was achieved on January 16, 1969, between [[Soyuz 4]] and [[Soyuz 5]]. This early version of the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] had no internal transfer tunnel, but two cosmonauts performed an [[extravehicular activity|extravehicular]] transfer from Soyuz 5 to Soyuz 4, landing in a different spacecraft than they had launched in. 

In the 1970s, the Soviet Union upgraded the Soyuz spacecraft to add an internal transfer tunnel and used it to transport cosmonauts during the [[Salyut]] space station program with the first successful space station visit beginning on 7 June 1971, when [[Soyuz 11]] docked to [[Salyut 1]]. The United States followed suit, docking its Apollo spacecraft to the [[Skylab]] space station in May 1973. In July 1975, the two nations cooperated in the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]], docking an Apollo spacecraft with a Soyuz using a specially designed docking module to accommodate the different docking systems and spacecraft atmospheres.

Beginning with [[Salyut 6]] in 1978, the Soviet Union began using the uncrewed [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] cargo spacecraft to resupply its space stations in low earth orbit, greatly extending the length of crew stays. As an uncrewed spacecraft, Progress rendezvoused and docked with the space stations entirely automatically. In 1986, the Igla docking system was replaced with the updated Kurs system on Soyuz spacecraft. Progress spacecraft received the same upgrade several years later.&lt;ref name=MirHH /&gt;{{rp|7}}  The Kurs system is still used to dock to the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] of the [[ISS]] today.

===Androgyny===
{{Wiktionary|androgynous}}

Docking/berthing systems may be either androgynous ([[hermaphroditic connector|ungendered]]) or non-androgynous ([[gender of connectors and fasteners|gendered]]), indicating which parts of the system may mate together.

Early systems for conjoining spacecraft were all non-androgynous docking system designs. Non-androgynous designs are a form of "gender mating"&lt;ref name=nasa20090317/&gt; where each spacecraft to be joined has a unique design ("male" or "female") and a specific role to play in the docking process. The roles cannot be reversed. Furthermore, two spacecraft of the same gender cannot be joined at all.

Androgynous docking (and later androgynous berthing) by contrast has an identical interface on both spacecraft. In an androgynous interface, there is a single design which can connect to a duplicate of itself. This allows system-level [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] (role reversing) as well as rescue and collaboration between any two spacecraft. It also provides more flexible mission design and reduces unique mission analysis and training.&lt;ref name=nasa20090317/&gt;

| The original Soyuz "probe and drogue" docking system was used with the first generation [[Soyuz 7K-OK]] spacecraft from 1966 &lt;!--Kosmos 133--&gt; until 1970&lt;!--Soyuz 9--&gt;, in order to gather engineering data as a preparation for the Soviet space station program. The gathered data were subsequently used for the conversion of the Soyuz spacecraft – which was initially developed for the [[Soviet manned lunar programs|Soviet manned lunar program]] – into a space station transport craft.&lt;ref name=her/&gt;&lt;!--From the heritage document: "The Original Soyuz survived the Moon program to become the ancestor of all subsequent Soyuz and Soyuz-derived craft. Spacecraft designer Konstantin Feoktistov stated that the Original Soyuz missions in 1966-1970 provided engineering data for its conversion into a space station transport." --&gt;
A first docking with two unmanned Soyuz spacecraft – the first fully automated space docking in the history of space flight – was made with the [[Kosmos 186 and Kosmos 188]] missions on October 30, 1967.

It consisted of a spherical section (2.55 m in diameter) topped with a cylindrical tunnel (2.2 m in diameter) with an APAS-89 androgynous docking port, a modified version of the APAS-75 system developed by NPO Energiya for the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (Page 141). The plan was for the orbiter to be launched unmanned and fly to the Mir space station, where it would dock with the axial APAS-89 docking port of the Kristall module (Page 246). In the late 1980s NPO Energiya was ordered to build three Soyuz spacecraft (serial numbers 101, 102, 103) with APAS-89 docking ports (Page 246). Soyuz craft nr. 101 was eventually launched as Soyuz TM-16 on January 1993, carrying another resident crew (Gennadiy Manakov and Aleksandr Poleshchuk) to Mir space station. Equipped with an APAS-89 docking port, it was the only Soyuz vehicle to ever docking with the Kristall module. Soyuz "rescue" vehicle nr. 102 and 103, which had only been partially assembled, were modified as ordinary Soyuz TM spacecraft with standard "probe" docking mechanisms and were given new serial numbers (Page 249). In July 1992 NASA initiated the development of the Orbiter Docking System (ODS) to support Shuttle flights to Mir. Mounted in the forward end of the payload bay, the ODS consists of an external airlock, a supporting truss structure, and an APAS docking port. While the first two elements were built by Rockwell, the APAS was manufactured by RKK Energiya. Although Energiya's internal designator for the Shuttle APAS is APAS-95, it is essentially the same as Buran's APAS-89. While the ODS was slightly modified for Shuttle missions to ISS, APAS remained unchanged (Page 380).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRb1yAGVWNsC&amp;dq=%22APAS-95%22+nasa&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mir Docking Module]]), [[Soyuz TM-16]],&lt;ref name=Mir/&gt;&lt;ref name="sovietspaceshuttledockingmodule"/&gt; [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] (was planned).&lt;ref name="sovietspaceshuttledockingmodule"/&gt; It had a circular transfer passage with a diameter of {{convert|800|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=her/&gt;&lt;ref name=ARDS/&gt;&lt;ref name=AdvanDock/&gt;

===Adapters===
A docking or berthing adapter is a mechanical or electromechanical device that facilitates the connection of one type of docking or berthing interface to a different interface. While such interfaces may theoretically be docking/docking, docking/berthing, or berthing/berthing, only the first two types have been deployed in space to date. Previously launched and planned to be launched adapters are listed below:

==Docking of unmanned spacecraft==
[[File:Hubble Space Telescope Final Mission.png|thumb|350871main s125e011810 hires full (cropped&amp;rotated)|The Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM) added in 2009 to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. The SCM allows both manned and unmanned spacecraft that utilize the [[NASA Docking System]] (NDS) to dock with Hubble.]]
For the first fifty years of spaceflight, the main objective of most ''docking'' and ''berthing'' missions was to transfer crew, construct or resupply a space station, or to test for such a mission (e.g. the docking between [[Kosmos 186 and Kosmos 188]]).
Therefore, commonly at least one of the participating spacecraft was "manned", with a pressurized habitable volume (e.g. a space station or a lunar lander) being the target – the exceptions were a few fully unmanned Soviet docking missions (e.g. the dockings of Kosmos 1443 and Progress 23 to an unmanned [[Salyut 7]] or [[Progress M1-5]] to an unmanned [[Mir]]).
Another exception were a few missions of the manned US [[Space Shuttle]]s, like berthings of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) during the five HST servicing missions.

Changes to the "manned" aspect began in 2015, as a number of economically driven commercial dockings of unmanned spacecraft were planned. In 2011, two commercial spacecraft providers  announced plans to provide [[Autonomous robot|autonomous]]/[[Teleoperation|teleoperated]] [[unmanned resupply spacecraft]] for servicing other unmanned spacecraft. Notably, both of these servicing spacecraft were intending to dock with satellites that weren't designed for docking, nor for in-space servicing.

The early business model for these services was primarily in near-[[geosynchronous]] orbit, although [[delta-v|large delta-v]] [[orbital maneuver]]ing services were also envisioned.&lt;ref name=av20110321/&gt;

Building off of the 2007 [[Orbital Express]] mission — a [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]-sponsored mission to test in-space satellite servicing with two vehicles designed from the ground up for on-orbit refueling and subsystem replacement — two companies announced plans for commercial satellite servicing missions that would require docking of two unmanned vehicles.

* [[Space Infrastructure Servicing]] (SIS) is a [[spacecraft]] that was being developed by [[Canada|Canadian]] aerospace firm [[MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates]] (MDA)—maker of [[Canadarm]]—to operate as a small-scale in-space [[propellant depot|refueling depot]] for [[communication satellites]] in [[geosynchronous orbit]].

 |quote=''more than 40 different types of fueling systems ... SIS will be carrying enough tools to open 75 percent of the fueling systems aboard satellites now in geostationary orbit. ... MDA will launch the SIS servicer, which will rendezvous and dock with the Intelsat satellite, attaching itself to the ring around the satellite’s apogee-boost motor. With ground teams governing the movements, the SIS robotic arm will reach through the nozzle of the apogee motor to find and unscrew the satellite’s fuel cap. The SIS vehicle will reclose the fuel cap after delivering the agreed amount of propellant and then head to its next mission. ... Key to the business model is MDA’s ability to launch replacement fuel canisters that would be grappled by SIS and used to refuel dozens of satellites over a period of years. These canisters would be much lighter than the SIS vehicle and thus much less expensive to launch. ''

A prominent spacecraft that received a mechanism for unmanned dockings is the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST). In 2009 the [[STS-125]] shuttle mission added the Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM) at the aft bulkhead of the space telescope. The SCM is meant for unpressurized dockings and will be used at the end of Hubble's service lifetime to dock an unmanned spacecraft to de-orbit Hubble. The SCM used was designed to be compatible to the [[NASA Docking System]] (NDS) interface to reserve the possibility of a [[Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle]] docked mission.&lt;ref name="softcap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/servicing/SM4/main/SCRS_FS_HTML.html|title=The Soft Capture and Rendezvous System|accessdate=May 22, 2009|publisher=NASA|year=2008|author=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-cooperative docking==

Docking with a spacecraft (or other man made space object) that does not have an operable attitude control system might sometimes be desirable, either in order to salvage it, or to initiate a controlled [[Atmospheric entry|de-orbit]]. Some theoretical techniques for docking with non-cooperative spacecraft have been proposed so far.&lt;ref name=ieee200610&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ma |first=Zhanhua |author2=Ma, Ou |author3=Shashikanth, Banavara |last-author-amp=yes |title=Optimal Control for Spacecraft to Rendezvous with a Tumbling Satellite in a Close Range |url=http://mae.nmsu.edu/~oma/Papers/Paper_Optimal_Ctrl_IROS06.pdf |journal=Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems |date=October 2006 |pages=4109–4114 |accessdate=2011-08-09 |quote=''One of the most challenging tasks for satellite on-orbit servicing is to rendezvous and capture a non-cooperative satellite such as a tumbling satellite.'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605184656/http://mae.nmsu.edu/~oma/Papers/Paper_Optimal_Ctrl_IROS06.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Ma et al. assume a standardized "docking interface" exists on each spacecraft; see pp 4109. --&gt; Yet, with the sole exception of the [[Soyuz T-13]] mission to salvage the crippled [[Salyut 7]] space station, {{asof|2006|lc=y}}&lt;!-- 2006 is the date of the source --&gt;, all spacecraft dockings in the first fifty years of spaceflight had been accomplished with vehicles where both spacecraft involved were under either piloted, autonomous or telerobotic [[attitude control]].&lt;ref name=ieee200610/&gt;
In 2007, however, a demonstration mission was flown that included an initial [[flight test|test]] of a [[NEXTSat|non-cooperative spacecraft]]&lt;!-- in the literature on this subject, "non-cooperative" does not mean "uncooperative"; it merely means that the non-cooperative spacecraft is orbiting with no active attitude control underway by the spacecraft, and no intent to assist in the capture. --&gt; captured by a [[ASTRO (satellite)|controlled spacecraft]] with the use of a robotic arm.&lt;ref name=sfn20070704/&gt;

[[Salyut 7]], the tenth space station of any kind launched, and [[Soyuz T-13]] were docked in what author David S. F. Portree describes as "one of the most impressive feats of in-space repairs in history".&lt;ref name=Mir/&gt; Solar tracking failed and due to a telemetry fault the station did not report the failure to mission control while flying autonomously. Once the station ran out of electrical energy reserves it ceased communication abruptly in February 1985. Crew scheduling was interrupted to allow Russian military commander [[Vladimir Dzhanibekov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/d/dzhanibekov.html |title=Dzhanibekov |publisher=Astronautix.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and technical science flight engineer [[Viktor Savinykh]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/s/savinykh.html |title=Savinykh |publisher=Astronautix.com |date= |accessdate=August 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; to make emergency repairs.

All Soviet and Russian space stations were equipped with automatic rendezvous and docking systems, from the first space station Salyut 1 using the IGLA system, to the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] of the [[International Space Station]] using the [[Kurs (docking system)|Kurs]] system. The soyuz crew found the station was not broadcasting radar or telemetry for rendezvous, and after arrival and external inspection of the tumbling station, the crew judged proximity using handheld laser rangefinders.

Dzhanibekov piloted his ship to intercept the forward port of Salyut 7, matched the station's rotation and achieved soft dock with the station. After achieving hard dock they confirmed that the station's electrical system was dead. Prior to opening the hatch, Dzhanibekov and Savinykh sampled the condition of the station's atmosphere and found it satisfactory. Attired in winter fur-lined clothing, they entered the cold station to conduct repairs. Within a week sufficient systems were brought back online to allow robot cargo ships to dock with the station. Nearly two months went by before atmospheric conditions on the space station were normalized.&lt;ref name=Mir/&gt;

===Uncrewed dockings of non-cooperative space objects===
{{Globalize/US|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Orbital Express 2.png|thumb|left|Orbital Express: ASTRO (left) and NEXTSat (right), 2007.]]

Non-cooperative rendezvous and capture techniques have been theorized, and [[Orbital Express|one mission]] has successfully been performed with uncrewed spacecraft in orbit.&lt;ref name=sfn20070704&gt;
{{cite news |last=Clark|first=Stephen |title=In-space satellite servicing tests come to an end |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0707/04orbitalexpress/ |accessdate=2014-03-20 |newspaper=Spaceflight Now |date=2007-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical approach for solving this problem involves two phases. First, [[attitude control|attitude]] and [[Orbit (dynamics)|orbital]] changes are made to the "chaser" spacecraft until it has zero relative motion with the "target" spacecraft. Second, docking maneuvers commence that are similar to traditional cooperative spacecraft docking. A standardized docking interface on each spacecraft is assumed.&lt;ref name=nmsu2008&gt;
{{cite web |title=Optimal Control of Rendezvous and Docking with a Non-Cooperative Satellite |url=http://mae.nmsu.edu/~oma/Posters/Satellite_RnD_Ma.pdf |publisher=New Mexico State University |quote=''Most of the current research and all the past missions are aiming at capturing very cooperative satellites only.

NASA has identified automated and autonomous rendezvous and docking — the ability of two spacecraft to rendezvous and dock "operating independently from human controllers and without other back-up, [and which requires technology] advances in sensors, software, and [[Real-time Control System|realtime]] [[Orbital station-keeping|on-orbit positioning]] and [[Attitude control (spacecraft)#Attitude Control|flight control]], among other challenges" — as a critical technology to the "ultimate success of capabilities such as in-orbit [[propellant depot|propellant storage and refueling]]," and also for complex operations in assembling mission components for interplanetary destinations.&lt;ref name=nasa20100525&gt;{{cite web|last=Tooley|first=Craig|title=A New Space Enterprise of Exploration|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/458813main_FTD_AutomatedAutonomousRendezvousAndDockingVehicleOverview.pdf|date=2010-05-25|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Automated/Autonomous Rendezvous &amp; Docking Vehicle (ARDV) is a proposed [[Flagship technology demonstrations|NASA Flagship Technology Demonstration]] (FTD) mission, for flight as early as 2014/2015. An important NASA objective on the proposed mission is to advance the technology and demonstrate automated rendezvous and docking. One mission element defined in the 2010 analysis was the development of a laser proximity operations sensor that could be used for non-cooperative vehicles at distances between {{convert|1|m}} and {{convert|3|km|sigfig=1|sp=us}}. Non-cooperative docking mechanisms were identified as critical mission elements to the success of such autonomous missions.&lt;ref name=nasa20100525/&gt;

[[Grapple Fixture|Grappling]] and connecting to non-cooperative space objects was identified as a top technical challenge in the 2010 NASA Robotics, tele-robotics and autonomous systems roadmap.&lt;ref name=nasa201011&gt;{{cite web|last=Ambrose|first=Rob|title=Robotics, Tele-Robotics and Autonomous systems Roadmap (Draft)|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/501622main_TA04-Robotics-DRAFT-Nov2010-A.pdf|date=November 2010|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2012-06-25|quote=''A smaller common docking system for robotic spacecraft is also needed to enable robotic spacecraft AR&amp;D within the capture envelopes of these systems. Assembly of the large vehicles and stages used for beyond LEO exploration missions will require new mechanisms with new capture envelopes beyond any docking system currently used or in development. Development and testing of autonomous robotic capture of non-cooperative target vehicles in which the target does not have capture aids such as grapple fixtures or docking mechanisms is needed to support satellite servicing/rescue.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berthing spacecraft and modules==
Docking and undocking describe spacecraft using a docking port, without assistance and under their own power. Berthing takes place when a spacecraft or unpowered module cannot use a docking port or requires assistance to use one. This assistance may come from a spacecraft, such as when the [[Space Shuttle]] used its robotic arm to push ISS modules into their permanent berths. In a similar fashion the [[Poisk (ISS module)|Poisk module]] was permanently berthed to a docking port after it was pushed into place by a [[Progress M-MIM2|modified Progress spacecraft]] which was then discarded. The [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus resupply spacecraft]] arriving at the ISS does not connect to a [[Androgynous_Peripheral_Attach_System#APAS-95|docking port]], instead it is pulled into a berthing mechanism by the station's robotic arm and the station then closes the connection. The [[common berthing mechanism|berthing mechanism]] is used only on the [[US Orbital Segment|US segment]] of the ISS, the [[Russian Orbital Segment|Russian segment]] of the ISS uses [[Androgynous_Peripheral_Attach_System#APAS-95|docking ports]] for permanent berths.

==Mars surface docking==
Docking has been discussed by NASA in regards to a [[Crewed Mars rover]], such as with [[Mars habitat]] or ascent stage.&lt;reF&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/464826main_SEV_Concept_FactSheet.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt;

'''Etiquette''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|t|ᵻ|ˌ|k|ɛ|t}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|t|ᵻ|k|ᵻ|t}}, {{IPA-fr|e.ti.kɛt|lang}}) is a [[Ethical code|code of behavior]] that delineates expectations for [[social behavior]] according to contemporary [[Convention (norm)|conventional]] [[Norm (sociology)|norms]] within a [[society]], [[social class]], or [[Group (sociology)|group]].

The French word ''[[wikt:étiquette|étiquette]]'', literally signifying a tag or label, was used in a modern sense in English around 1750.&lt;ref&gt;''[[OED]]'', "Etiquette".&lt;/ref&gt; Etiquette is behaviour that assists survival and has changed and evolved over the years.

==History==
[[File:Zuidgevel Corps de logis rond 1675 Anonieme schilder.jpg|thumb|[[Louis XIV]]'s court at the [[Palace of Versailles]] developed an elaborate form of etiquette.]]

In the 3rd millennium BC, [[Ptahhotep]] wrote ''[[The Maxims of Ptahhotep]]''. The Maxims were conformist precepts extolling such civil virtues as truthfulness, self-control and kindness towards one's fellow beings. Learning by listening to everybody and knowing that human knowledge is never perfect are a [[leitmotif]]. Avoiding open conflict wherever possible should not be considered weakness. Stress is placed on the pursuit of [[justice]], although it is conceded that it is a god's command that prevails in the end. Some of the maxims refer to one's behaviour when in the presence of the great, how to choose the right master and how to serve him. Others teach the correct way to lead through openness and kindness. Greed is the base of all evil and should be guarded against, while generosity towards family and friends is deemed praiseworthy.

[[Confucius]] (551–479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher whose philosophy emphasized personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice and sincerity.

[[Baldassare Castiglione]] (Italian: [baldasˈsaːre kastiʎˈʎoːne]; December 6, 1478 – February 2, 1529), count of Casatico, was an Italian courtier, diplomat, soldier and a prominent Renaissance author, who is probably most famous for his authorship of The Book of the Courtier. The work was an example of a courtesy book, dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier, and was very influential in 16th century European court circles.

[[Louis XIV]] (1638–1718) "transformed a royal hunting lodge in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], a village 25 miles southwest of the capital, into one of the largest palaces in the world, officially moving his court and government there in 1682. It was against this awe-inspiring backdrop that Louis tamed the [[nobility]] and impressed foreign dignitaries, using entertainment, ceremony and a highly codified system of etiquette to assert his supremacy.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/louis-xiv|title=Louis XIV|publisher=[[History.com]]|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politeness===
{{Main article|Politeness}}
[[File:Joseph Highmore - A Club of Gentlemen - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Members of a [[Gentlemen's club]] had to conform to a socially acceptable standard of politeness. The painting, ''A Club of Gentlemen'' by [[Joseph Highmore]] c. 1730.]]

During the [[Enlightenment era]], a self-conscious process of the imposition of polite norms and behaviours became a symbol of being a genteel member of the upper class. Upwardly mobile [[middle class]] [[bourgeoisie]] increasingly tried to identify themselves with the elite through their adopted artistic preferences and their standards of behaviour. They became preoccupied with precise rules of etiquette, such as when to show [[emotion]], the art of elegant dress and graceful conversation and how to act courteously, especially with women. Influential in this new discourse was a series of essays on the nature of politeness in a commercial society, penned by the philosopher [[Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]] in the early 18th century. Shaftesbury defined politeness as the art of being pleasing in company:
:'Politeness' may be defined a dext'rous management of our words and actions, whereby we make other people have better opinion of us and themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Third Earl of Shaftesbury and the Progress of Politeness|jstor = 2738536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodicals, such as ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', founded as a daily publication by [[Joseph Addison]] and [[Richard Steele]] in 1711, gave regular advice to its readers on how to conform to the etiquette required of a polite gentleman. Its stated goal was "to enliven morality with wit, and to temper wit with morality... to bring philosophy out of the closets and libraries, schools and colleges, to dwell in clubs and assemblies, at tea-tables and coffeehouses" It provided its readers with educated, topical talking points, and advice in how to carry on conversations and social interactions in a polite manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-britain.co.uk/famdates.php?id=888|title=Information Britain|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The allied notion of 'civility' – referring to a desired social interaction which valued sober and reasoned debate on matters of interest – also became an important quality for the 'polite classes'.&lt;ref&gt;Cowan, 2005. p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Established rules and procedures for proper behaviour as well as etiquette conventions, were outlined by [[gentlemen's club]]s, such as Harrington's Rota Club. Periodicals, including ''[[Tatler (1709)|The Tatler]]'' and ''[[The Spectator (1711)|The Spectator]]'', infused politeness into English coffeehouse conversation, as their explicit purpose lay in the reformation of English manners and morals.&lt;ref name="Mackie, 1998. p 1"&gt;Mackie, 1998. p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Etiquette is the virtue of morality and code of behaviour.

[[Image:Philip Dormer Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield by William Hoare.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield|The Earl of Chesterfield]] invented the term 'etiquette' in the mid-18th century. Painting by [[William Hoare]].]]
It was [[Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield]] who first used the word 'etiquette' in its modern meaning, in his ''Letters to His Son on the Art of Becoming a Man of the World and a Gentleman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=de&amp;tbo=p&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=isbn:1848546661 |title=Sorry! The English and Their Manners |author=Henry Hitchings |year=2013 |publisher=Hachette UK |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work comprised over 400 letters written from 1737 or 1738 and continuing until his son's death in 1768, and were mostly instructive letters on various subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, Christopher. "Letters To His Son". The Literary Encyclopedia. First published 25 February 2007 [http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=21002, accessed 30 November 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; The letters were first published by his son's widow [[Eugenia Stanhope]] in 1774. Chesterfield endeavoured to decouple the issue of manners from conventional morality, arguing that mastery of etiquette was an important weapon for social advancement. The Letters were full of elegant wisdom and perceptive observation and deduction. Chesterfield epitomised the restraint of polite 18th-century society, writing, for instance, in 1748:
{{quote|
I would heartily wish that you may often be seen to smile, but never heard to laugh while you live. Frequent and loud laughter is the characteristic of folly and ill-manners; it is the manner in which the mob express their silly joy at silly things; and they call it being merry. In my mind there is nothing so illiberal, and so ill-bred, as audible laughter. I am neither of a melancholy nor a cynical disposition, and am as willing and as apt to be pleased as anybody; but I am sure that since I have had the full use of my reason nobody has ever heard me laugh.
}}

By the [[Victorian era]], etiquette had developed into an exceptionally complicated system of rules, governing everything from the proper method for writing letters and using [[cutlery]] to the minutely regulated interactions between different classes and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Tudor Rose" |title=Victorian Society |publisher=AboutBritain.com |date=1999–2010 |url=http://www.aboutbritain.com/articles/victorian-society.asp |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manners==
[[File:High-Change-in-Bond-Street-Gillray.jpeg|thumb|In ''High-Change in Bond Street,—ou—la Politesse du Grande Monde'' (1796), [[James Gillray]] caricatured the lack of etiquette in a group of men leering at women and crowding them off a pavement.]]

Manners are described as good or bad to indicate whether or not a behavior is socially acceptable. Every culture adheres to a different set of manners, although a lot of manners are cross-culturally common. Manners are a subset of social norms which are informally enforced through self-regulation and social policing and publicly performed. They enable human ‘ultrasociality’ &lt;ref&gt;Richerson and Boyd, [http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/ultra.pdf "The Evolution of Human Ultra Sociality"], ''In press: I. Eibl-Eibisfeldt and F. Salter, eds. Ideology, Warfare, and Indoctrinability'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt; by imposing self-restraint and compromise on regular, everyday actions.

=== Sociology perspectives===
In his book [[The Civilizing Process]], [[Norbert Elias]] &lt;ref&gt;Norbert Elias, [http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/faculty/boyd/ultra.pdfhttp://www.norberteliasfoundation.nl/ "The Civilizing Process"], ''Oxford Blackwell Publishers'', 1994&lt;/ref&gt; argued that manners arose as a product of group living and persist as a way of maintaining social order.  He theorized that manners proliferated during the [[Renaissance]] in response to the development of the ‘absolute state’ – the progression from small group living to the centralization of power by the state. Elias believed that the rituals associated with manners in the Court Society of England during this period were closely bound with social status. To him, manners demonstrate an individual’s position within a social network and act as a means by which the individual can negotiate that position.

Petersen and Lupton argue that manners helped reduce the boundaries between the [[public sphere]] and the [[private sphere]] and gave rise to ''“a highly reflective self, a self who monitors his or her behavior with due regard for others with whom he or she interacts socially.”'' They explain that; ''“The public behavior of ''individuals came to signify their social standing, a means of presenting the self and of evaluating others and thus the control of the outward self was''
''vital.”'' &lt;ref&gt;Petersen A., Lupton D., [https://books.google.com/books/about/The_New_Public_Health.html?id=RofiHHQddx0C "The Healthy Citizen"], in The New Public Health – Discourses, Knowledges,
Strategies, ''London, SAGE'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, manners are seen not just as a means of displaying one’s [[social status]], but also as a
means of  maintaining social
boundaries relative to class and identity.

[[Pierre Bourdieu]]’s notion of ''‘[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]’'' can also contribute to the understanding of manners.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu P., [http://ebooks.cambridge.org/ebook.jsf?bid=CBO9780511812507 "Outline of a Theory of Practice], ''Cambridge, Cambridge University Press'', 1977&lt;/ref&gt; The habitus, he explains, is a set of ''‘dispositions’'' that are
neither self-determined, nor pre-determined, by external environmental factors. They tend to operate at a subconscious level and are ''“inculcated through experience and explicit teaching”'' &lt;ref&gt;Jenkins R., [https://books.google.com/books/about/Pierre_Bourdieu.html?id=aPVaHgUx1f0C "Pierre Bourdieu (Key Sociologists)], ''Cornwall, Routledge'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and produced and reproduced by social interactions. Manners, in this view, are likely to be a central part of the ''‘dispositions’'' which guide an individual’s ability to make socially compliant behavioral decisions.

===Anthropology perspectives===
Anthropologists concern themselves primarily with detailing cultural variances and differences in ''‘ways of seeing’.''  Theorists such as [[Mary Douglas]] have
claimed that each culture’s unique set of manners, behaviors and rituals enable the local cosmology to remain ordered and free from those things that may pollute or
defile it.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas M., [http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/schloesser/HS041-042/fall/w04/resources/DOUGLAS_Purity-Danger.pdf "Purity and Danger – An Analysis of Concepts of Pollution and Taboo] ''London, Routledge'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, she suggests that ideas of pollution and disgust are attached to the margins of socially acceptable behavior to curtail such actions and
maintain''“ the assumptions by which experience is controlled.”''

=== Evolutionary biology perspectives===
Evolutionary biology looks at the origin of  behavior and the motivation behind it. [[Charles Darwin]] analyzed the remarkable universality of facial responses to [[disgust]], [[shame]] and other complex emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin C., [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?pageseq=1&amp;itemID=F1142&amp;viewtype=text ''The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals''] London, Penguin, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Having identified the same behavior in young infants and blind individuals he concluded that these responses are not learned but innate. According to [[Val Curtis]],&lt;ref&gt;Curtis V.,[http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199579488.do#.Ul6c1BAwK8A ''Don’t Look, Don't Touch – The Science Behind Revulsion''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728230238/http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199579488.do |date=2014-07-28 }} Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2013&lt;br&gt;Curtis V. Aunger R, Rabie T.,[http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/271/Suppl_4/S131.abstract "Evidence that disgust evolved to protect from risk of disease] ''Royal Society B: Biological Sciences'', '''271 Suppl''': S131–33., 2004&lt;/ref&gt; the development of these responses was concomitant with the development of manners behavior. For Curtis, manners play an evolutionary role in the prevention of [[disease]]. This assumes that those who were hygienic, polite to others and most able to benefit from their membership within a cultural group, stand the best
chance of survival and reproduction.

Catherine Cottrell and [[Steven Neuberg]] explore how our behavioral responses to ‘otherness’ may enable the preservation of manners and norms.&lt;ref name="Evolutionary Bases of Prejudices"&gt;Neuberg SL., Cottrell CA.,[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=aJe9fLi8pW0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=%28Cottrell+%26+Neuberg+2005%29.+evolutionary+bases+of+prejudice&amp;ots=RKGAer-6uw&amp;sig=nDTy2QDmZca9l36r9D3vs9idnQQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%28Cottrell%20%26%20Neuberg%202005%29.%20evolutionary%20bases%20of%20prejudice&amp;f=false "Evolutionary Bases of Prejudices"] in Schaller M. et al., ed. ''Evolution and Social Psychology''. New York, Psychology Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that the foreignness or unfamiliarity we experience when interacting with different cultural groups for the first time, may partly serve an evolutionary function: ''“Group living surrounds one with individuals able to physically harm fellow group members, to spread contagious disease, or to “free ride” on their efforts. A commitment to sociality thus carries a risk: If threats such as these are left unchecked, the costs of sociality will quickly exceed its benefits. Thus, to maximize the returns on group ''living, individual group members should be attuned to others’ features or behaviors.”''&lt;ref name="Evolutionary Bases of Prejudices"/&gt;

Thus, people who possess similar traits, common to the group, are to be trusted, whereas those who do not are to be considered as ‘others’ and treated with suspicion or even exclusion. Curtis argues that selective pressure borne out of a shift towards [[communal living]] would have resulted in individuals being shunned from the group for hygiene lapses or uncooperative behavior. This would have led to people avoiding actions that might result in embarrassment or others being disgusted.&lt;ref name="ukcatalogue.oup.com"&gt;Curtis V.,[http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199579488.do#.Ul6c1BAwK8A "Don’t Look, Don't Touch – The Science Behind Revulsion"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728230238/http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780199579488.do |date=2014-07-28 }} Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Henrich]] and [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]] developed a
model to demonstrate this process at work. They explain [[natural selection]] has favored the acquisition of genetically transmitted learning mechanisms that increase an individual’s chance of acquiring locally adaptive behavior. They hypothesize that: ''“Humans possess a reliably developing neural encoding that compels them both to punish individuals who violate group norms (common beliefs or practices) and punish individuals who do not punish norm violators.”''&lt;ref&gt;Henrich J, Boyd R., [http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138%2898%2900018-X/abstract "The Evolution of Conformist Transmission and the Emergence of Between Group Differences"]''Evolution and Human Behavior'', '''19(4)''':215–41, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; From this approach, manners are a means of mitigating undesirable behavior and fostering the benefits of in-group cooperation.

===Types===
Curtis also specifically outlines three manner categories; [[hygiene]], [[courtesy]] and cultural [[Norm (social)|norms]], each of which help to account for the multifaceted role manners play in society.&lt;ref name="ukcatalogue.oup.com"/&gt;
These categories are based on the outcome rather than the motivation of manners behavior and individual manner behaviors may fit into 2 or more categories.

'''Hygiene Manners''' – are any manners which affect [[disease transmission]]. They are likely to be taught at an early age, primarily through parental discipline, positive behavioral
enforcement of continence with bodily fluids (such as toilet training), and the avoidance or removal of items that pose a disease risk for children. It is expected that,
by adulthood, hygiene manners are so entrenched in one’s behavior that they become second nature.  Violations are likely to elicit [[disgust]] responses.

'''Courtesy Manners''' – demonstrate one’s ability to put the interests of others before oneself; to display self-control and good intent for the purposes of being trusted
in social interactions. Courtesy manners help to maximize the benefits of group living by regulating social interaction. Disease avoidance behavior can sometimes be compromised in the performance of courtesy manners. They may be taught in the same way as hygiene manners but are likely to also be learned through direct,
indirect (i.e. observing the interactions of others) or imagined (i.e. through the [[executive functions]] of the brain) social interactions. The learning of courtesy manners may take place
at an older age than hygiene manners, because individuals must have at least some means of communication and some awareness of self and social positioning.
The violation of courtesy manners most commonly results in social disapproval from peers.

'''Cultural Norm Manners''' – typically demonstrate one’s [[Identity (social science)|identity]] within a specific socio-cultural group. Adherence to cultural norm manners allows for the demarcation of socio-cultural identities and the creation of boundaries which inform who is to be trusted or who is to be deemed as ‘other’. Cultural norm manners are learnt through the enculturation and routinisation of ‘the familiar’ and through exposure to ‘otherness’ or those who are identified as foreign or different. Transgressions and non-adherence to cultural norm manners commonly result in [[Social alienation|alienation]]. Cultural norms, by their very nature, have a high level of between-group variability but are likely to be common to all those who identify with a given group identity.

Rules of etiquette encompass most aspects of social interaction in any society, though the term itself is not commonly used. A rule of etiquette may reflect an underlying [[ethical code]], or it may reflect a person's [[fashion]] or [[Social status|status]]. Rules of etiquette are usually unwritten, but aspects of etiquette have been codified from time to time.

===Books===
[[Baldassare Castiglione]] was an Italian courtier, diplomat, soldier and a prominent Renaissance author, who is probably most famous for his authorship of The Book of the Courtier. The work was an example of a courtesy book, dealing with questions of the etiquette and morality of the courtier, and was very influential in 16th century European court circles.

[[Erasmus]] of Rotterdam published his book ''On Good Manners for Boys'' in 1530. Amid his advice for young children on [[fidgeting]], [[yawning]], bickering and scratching he highlights that a core tenet of manners is the ability to “''readily ignore the faults of others but avoid falling short yourself''”.&lt;ref&gt;Rotterdam, E. of. (1536). ''A Handbook on Good Manners for Children: De Civilitate Morum Puerilium Libellus''. (E. Merchant, Ed.) (English tr.). London: Preface Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

In centuries since then, many authors have tried to collate manners or etiquette guide books. One of the most famous of these was [[Emily Post]] who began to document etiquette in 1922. She described her work as detailing the “''trivialities''” of desirable everyday conduct but also provided descriptions of appropriate conduct for key life events such as [[baptism]]s, [[wedding]]s and [[funeral]]s. She later established an institute which continues to provide updated advice on how to negotiate modern day society with good manners and decorum. The most recent edition of her book provides advice on such topics as when it is acceptable to ‘unfriend’ someone on Facebook and who is entitled to which armrest when flying.&lt;ref&gt;Post, P., Post, A., Post, L., &amp; Senning, D. P. (2011). Emily Post’s Etiquette, 18th Edition (Emily Post's Etiquette). New York: William Morrow.&lt;/ref&gt; Etiquette books such as these as well as those by [[Amy Vanderbilt]],&lt;ref&gt;Vanderbilt, A. (1957). Amy Vanderbilt’s Complete Book Of Etiquette. New York: Doubleday &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Hartley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Florence |last=Hartley |year=1860 |title=The Ladies’ Book of Etiquette, and Manual of Politeness: A Complete Hand Book for the Use of the Lady in Polite Society |location=Boston |publisher=G.

New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sandi Toksvig]]&lt;ref&gt;Toksvig, S. (2013). ''Peas &amp; Queues: The Minefield of Modern Manners''. London: Profile Books Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; outline suggested behaviours for a range of social interactions. However, all note that to be a well-mannered person one must not merely read their books but be able to employ good manners fluidly in any situation that may arise. [[How Rude!]] is an American series of comic manners books for teens.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen R. Delisio, "[http://www.education-world.com/a_issues/chat/chat139.shtml Teaching Manners in a Manner-less World]", ''Education World'', July 4, 2005. Accessed 2&amp; July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western office and business===
The etiquette of business is the set of written and unwritten rules of conduct that make social interactions run more smoothly. Office etiquette in particular applies to coworker interaction, excluding interactions with external contacts such as customers and suppliers. When conducting group meetings in the United States, the assembly might follow ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'', if there are no other company policies to control a meeting.

These rules are often echoed throughout an industry or economy. For instance, 49% of employers surveyed in 2005 by the American National Association of Colleges and Employers found that non-traditional attire would be a "strong influence" on their opinion of a potential job candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |volume=50 |number=3 |title=Blue hair, body piercings--do employers care? |work=Grab Bag |publisher=Occupational Outlook Quarterly |date=Fall 2006 |url=http://stats.bls.gov/opub/ooq/2006/fall/grabbag.htm#B |accessdate=August 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Business Etiquette at companies such as [[IBM]] influence global business etiquette and professional standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sherman|first1=Joseph J|title=How they did it: Sharon Hill|url=http://simplebooklet.com/publish.php?wpKey=JWi8pGQwRiArQNq8XrLfwd#page=72|work=FYI Magazine|issue=August|date=2015|quote=Sharon was a rising start at IBM.  After a long span of promotions and top  performance reviews, her career changed with one of IBM's Vice Presidents choose to cut the number of employees at the company.  Sharon explains “My worldwide success, customer loyalty, and employee praise meant nothing. My department was cut and it was time to decide what I would do next in my life. That’s when I decided to follow my passion and start my own company. I got certified as an Etiquette trainer and was off and running. To this day, I thank IBM for teaching me professionalism and giving me the business acumen needed to start my business.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both office and business etiquette overlap considerably with basic tenets of [[netiquette]], the social conventions for using computer networks.

Business etiquette can vary significantly in different countries, which is invariably related to their culture. For example: A notable difference between Chinese and Western business etiquette is conflict handling.  Chinese businesses prefer to look upon relationship management to avoid conflicts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author="Ho-Ching Wei" |title=Chinese-Style Conflict Resolution: A Case of Taiwanese Business Immigrants in Australia |publisher=University of Western Sydney |url=http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2000v9n2/5%20Ho-Ching%20Wei.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123080428/http://www.uri.edu/iaics/content/2000v9n2/5%20Ho-Ching%20Wei.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 23, 2009 |accessdate=June 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – stemming from a culture that heavily relies on ''[[guanxi]]'' (personal connections) – while the west leaves resolution of conflict to the interpretations of law through contracts and lawyers.

Adjusting to foreign etiquettes is a major complement of [[culture shock]], providing a market for manuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=De Mente |first=Boyd |title=Chinese Etiquette &amp; Ethics in Business |publisher= NTC Business Books |location=Lincolnwood |year=1994 |isbn=0-8442-8524-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other resources include business and diplomacy institutions, available only in certain countries such as the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Institute of Diplomacy and Business  |url=http://www.diplomacyandbusiness.com/ |accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a group of etiquette experts and international business group formed a non-profit organization called IITTI (pronounced as "''ET''") to help human resource (HR) departments of multinationals in measuring the etiquette skills of prospective new employees during the recruitment process by standardizing image and etiquette examination, similar to what ISO does for industrial process measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iitti.org/about/about.htm|title=IITTI website "About Us"|publisher=|accessdate=13 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913174240/http://www.iitti.org/about/about.htm|archivedate=13 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etiquette in [[retail]] is sometimes summarized as "The customer is always right." {{quote|There are always two sides to the case, of course, and it is a credit to good manners that there is scarcely ever any friction in stores and shops of the first class. Salesmen and women are usually persons who are both patient and polite, and their customers are most often ladies in fact as well as "by courtesy." Between those before and those behind the counters, there has sprung up in many instances a relationship of mutual goodwill and friendliness. It is, in fact, only the woman who is afraid that someone may encroach upon her exceedingly insecure dignity, who shows neither courtesy nor consideration to any except those whom she considers it to her advantage to please.
[[Emily Post]] ''Etiquette'' 1922}}

==Cultural differences==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2011}}
[[File:AndriesBothLicehunting.jpg|thumb|''Hunting Lice by Candlelight'', [[Andries Both]] (Dutch, c. 1612/13 – 1641)]]

Etiquette is dependent on [[culture]]; what is excellent etiquette in one society may shock another. Etiquette evolves within culture. The Dutch painter [[Andries Both]] shows that the hunt for [[head lice]] (''illustration, right''), which had been a civilized grooming occupation in the early Middle Ages, a bonding experience that reinforced the comparative rank of two people, one groomed the other, one was the subject of the groomer, had become a peasant occupation by 1630. The painter portrays the familiar operation matter-of-factly, without the disdain this subject would have received in a 19th-century representation.

Etiquette can vary widely between different cultures and nations. For example, in [[Hausa people|Hausa]] culture, eating while standing may be seen as offensively casual and ill-omened behavior, insulting the host and showing a lack of respect for the scarcity of food—the offense is known as "eating with the devil" or "committing ''santi''." In China, a person who takes the last item of food from a common plate or bowl without first offering it to others at the table may be seen as a glutton who is insulting the host's generosity. Traditionally, if guests do not have leftover food in front of them at the end of a meal, it is to the dishonour of the host. In the United States of America, a guest is expected to eat all of the food given to them, as a compliment to the quality of the cooking. However, it is still considered polite to offer food from a common plate or bowl to others at the table.

In such rigid hierarchal cultures as Korea and Japan, alcohol helps to break down the strict social barrier between classes. It allows for a hint of informality to creep in. It is traditional for host and guest to take turns filling each other's cups and encouraging each other to gulp it down. For someone who does not consume alcohol (except for religious reasons), it can be difficult escaping the ritual of the social drink.&lt;ref name="IBC"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Charles |title=Short Course in International Business Culture |publisher=World Trade Press |location=San Rafael |year=1999 |isbn=1-885073-54-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Etiquette is a topic that has occupied writers and thinkers in all sophisticated societies for millennia, beginning with a behavior code by [[Ptahhotep]], a vizier in ancient Egypt's [[Old Kingdom]] during the reign of the Fifth Dynasty king [[Djedkare Isesi]] (c. 2414–2375 BC). All known literate civilizations, including ancient Greece and Rome, developed rules for proper social conduct. [[Confucius]] included rules for eating and speaking along with his more philosophical sayings.
[[File:High-change in Bond Street, - ou - la politesse du grande monde by James Gillray.jpg|thumb|High-change in Bond Street, - ou - la politesse du grande monde by James Gillray]]
[[Early modern]] conceptions of what behavior identifies a "[[gentleman]]" were codified in the 16th century, in a book by [[Baldassare Castiglione]], ''Il Cortegiano'' ("The Courtier"); its codification of expectations at the court of Urbino remained in force in its essentials until [[World War I]]. [[Louis XIV]] established an elaborate and rigid court ceremony, but distinguished himself from the high bourgeoisie by continuing to eat, stylishly and fastidiously, with his fingers. An important book about etiquette is ''[[Il Galateo]]'' by [[Giovanni della Casa]]; in fact, in [[Italian language|Italian]], etiquette is generally called ''galateo'' (or ''etichetta'' or ''protocollo'').

In the American colonies, [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[George Washington]] wrote codes of conduct for young gentlemen. The immense popularity of advice columns and books by [[Letitia Baldrige]] and [[Judith Martin|Miss Manners]] shows the currency of this topic. Even more recently, the rise of the Internet has necessitated the adaptation of existing rules of conduct to create [[Netiquette]], which governs the drafting of e-mail, rules for participating in an online forum, and so on.

In Germany, many books dealing with etiquette, especially dining, dressing etc., are called ''the [[Knigge]]'', named after [[Adolph Freiherr Knigge]] who wrote the book ''Über den Umgang mit Menschen'' (''On Human Relations'') in the late 18th century. However, this book is about good manners and also about the social state of its time, but not about etiquette.

Etiquette may be wielded as a social weapon. The outward adoption of the superficial mannerisms of an in-group, in the interests of social advancement rather than a concern for others, is considered by many a form of [[snob]]bery, lacking in [[virtue]].

{{Feminism sidebar |concepts}}
Feminism has affected culture in many ways, and has famously been theorised in relation to culture by [[Angela McRobbie]], [[Laura Mulvey]] and others. Timothy Laurie and Jessica Kean have argued that "one of [feminism's] most important innovations has been to seriously examine the ways women receive popular culture, given that so much pop culture is made by and for men."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Why consenting adults should see 50 Shades of Grey - and take their teens | first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Jessica | last2= Kean | newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald | year= 2015 | url= https://www.academia.edu/10818672}} February 19&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in a variety of forms, including literature, music, film and other screen cultures.

== Women's writing ==
[[File:Virginia Woolf 1927.jpg|thumb|[[Virginia Woolf]]]]
{{Main|Women's writing (literary category)}}
{{See also|Feminist literary criticism|Écriture féminine}}
Women's writing came to exist as a separate category of scholarly interest relatively recently. In the West, second-wave feminism prompted a general reevaluation of women's historical contributions, and various academic sub-disciplines, such as [[Women's history]] (or [[herstory]]) and women's writing (including [[Women's writing in English|in English]]) (a [[list of feminist literature|list]] is available), developed in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name="Blain"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Blain, Virginia |author2=Clements, Patricia; Grundy, Isobel |title=The Feminist Companion to Literature in English: Women Writers From the Middle Ages to the Present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0-300-04854-8 |page=1231}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virginia Blain et al. characterize the growth in interest since 1970 in women's writing as "powerful".&lt;ref name="Blain" /&gt; Much of this early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. Studies such as Dale Spender's ''Mothers of the Novel'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing. Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. Virago Press began to publish its large list of nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s, Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of eighteenth-century novels written by women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD1E3AF937A35756C0A960948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 Gilbert, Sandra M., ''Paperbacks: From Our Mothers' Libraries: Women Who Created the Novel'', in ''New York Times'', May 4, 1986].&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Broadview Press has begun to issue eighteenth- and nineteenth-century works, many hitherto out of print, and the University of Kentucky has a series of republications of early women's novels. There has been commensurate growth in the area of [[List of biographical dictionaries of women writers|biographical dictionaries of women writers]] due to a perception, according to one editor, that "most of our women are not represented in the 'standard' reference books in the field".&lt;ref name="Blain" /&gt;

=== Science fiction ===
{{Main|Feminist science fiction}}
In the 1960s, the genre of science fiction combined its sensationalism with political and technological critiques of society to produce [[feminist science fiction]]. With the advent of feminism, questioning women's roles became fair game to this "subversive, mind expanding genre".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Clute, John |author2=Nicholls, Peter |title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York |isbn=0-312-13486-X |page=1386}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two early texts are [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969) and [[Joanna Russ]]' ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1970). They serve to highlight the socially constructed nature of gender roles by creating [[utopia]]s that do away with gender.&lt;ref&gt;Helford, Elyce Rae, in Westfahl, Gary, ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy'' (Greenwood Press, 2005), 290.&lt;/ref&gt; Both authors were also pioneers in feminist criticism of science fiction in the 1960s and '70s, in essays collected in ''The Language of the Night'' (Le Guin, 1979) and ''How To Suppress Women's Writing'' (Russ, 1983). Another major work of feminist science fiction has been&lt;ref&gt;Sturgis, Susanna, ''Octavia E. Butler: June 22, 1947 &amp;mdash; February 24, 2006'', in ''The Women's Review of Books'', '''23'''(3): 19 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' by [[Octavia Butler]].

== Women's films ==
{{Main|Women's cinema}}
{{See also|Feminist film theory}}

The term "women's cinema" usually refers to the work of women [[film director]]s. It can also designate the work of other women behind the camera such as [[cinematographers]] and [[screenwriter]]s. Although the participation of women [[film editor]]s, [[costume designer]]s, and [[production designer]]s is usually not considered to be decisive enough to justify the term "women's cinema", it does have a large influence on the visual impression of any movie.

In a film from popular culture although not in women's film, an early reference to the "feminist movement" is heard from [[Katharine Hepburn]] in the 1942 movie ''[[Woman of the Year]]''.

== Women's music ==
{{main| Women's music}}

[[Women's music]] (or womyn's music or wimmin's music) is the music by women, for women, and about women.&lt;ref name="NoSmPvtPty"&gt;Lont, Cynthia, ''Women's Music: No Longer a Small Private Party'', in Reebee Garofalo, ed., ''Rockin' the Boat: Mass Music &amp; Mass Movements'' (Cambridge, MA: South End Press, 1992 ({{ISBN|0-89608-427-2}}), p. 242).&lt;/ref&gt; The genre emerged as a musical expression of the [[second-wave feminist]] movement&lt;ref&gt;Peraino, Judith, ''Girls with Guitars and Other Strange Stories'', in ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'', vol. 54, no. 3 (2001), p. 693.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[labour (economics)|labor]], [[civil rights]], and [[peace movement]]s.&lt;ref name="RadHarmonies"&gt;Mosbacher, Dee, ''Radical Harmonies'', ''Woman Vision'' (2002 (OCLC 53071762)). See also [http://www.woman-vision.org/radicalharmonies/index.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was started by lesbians such as [[Cris Williamson]], [[Meg Christian]], and [[Margie Adam]], African-American women activists such as [[Bernice Johnson Reagon]] and her group [[Sweet Honey in the Rock]], and peace activist [[Holly Near]].&lt;ref name="RadHarmonies" /&gt; Women's music also refers to the wider industry of women's music that goes beyond the performing artists to include [[studio musicians]], [[record producer|producers]], [[sound engineer]]s, [[technician]]s, cover artists, [[distributors]], [[promoter (entertainment)|promoter]]s, and festival organizers who are also women.&lt;ref name="NoSmPvtPty" /&gt;

== Riot grrrl movement ==
{{Main|Riot Grrrl}}
[[File:Khanna.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Kathleen Hanna]] was the lead singer of [[Bikini Kill]], a [[riot grrrl]] music band formed in 1990.]]

''Riot grrrl'' (or ''riot grrl'') is an underground feminist [[Punk rock|punk]] movement that started in the 1990s and is often associated with [[third-wave feminism]] (it is sometimes seen as its starting point). It was grounded in the [[DIY ethic|DIY philosophy]] of [[Punk ideologies#Punk ethics|punk values]]. Riot grrrls took an [[anti-corporate]] stance of [[self-sufficiency]] and [[Individualism|self-reliance]].&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Rowe-Finkbeiner, Kristin |title=The F-Word: Feminism In Jeopardy&amp;mdash;Women, Politics and the Future |year=2004 |publisher=Seal Press |isbn=1-58005-114-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot grrrls' emphasis on universal female identity and separatism often appears more closely allied with second-wave feminism than with the third wave.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg_Garofalo"&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Rosenberg, Jessica |title=Riot Grrrl: Revolutions From Within; Spring 1998 |journal=Signs |volume=23 |issue=Feminisms and Youth Cultures; number 3 |doi=10.1086/495289 |page=809 |author2=Gitana Garofalo |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, and female empowerment. Some bands associated with the movement are [[Bikini Kill]], [[Bratmobile]], [[Excuse 17]], [[Free Kitten]], [[Heavens to Betsy]], [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], [[L7 (band)|L7]], and [[Team Dresch]]. In addition to a music scene, riot grrrl is also a [[subculture]]; [[zines]], the [[DIY]] ethic, art, political action, and activism are part of the movement. Riot grrrls hold meetings, start chapters, and support and organize women in music.&lt;ref name="Schilt"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Schilt, Kristen |title='A Little Too Ironic': The Appropriation and Packaging of Riot Grrrl Politics by Mainstream Female Musicians |journal=Popular Music and Society |year=2003 |volume=26| issue =  1 |url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~kleong/riottgrrl%20analysis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The riot grrrl movement sprang out of [[Olympia, Washington]], and [[Washington, D.C.]], in the early 1990s. It sought to give women the power to control their voices and artistic expressions.&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner" /&gt; Riot grrrls took a growling double or triple r, placing it in the word ''girl'' as a way to take back the derogatory use of the term.&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner" /&gt;

The riot grrrls' links to social and political issues are where the beginnings of third-wave feminism can be seen. The music and zine writings are strong examples of "cultural politics in action, with strong women giving voice to important social issues though an empowered, a female oriented community, many people link the emergence of the third-wave feminism to this time".&lt;ref name="Rowe-Finbeiner" /&gt; The movement encouraged and made "adolescent girls' standpoints central", allowing them to express themselves fully.&lt;ref name="Code"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Code, Lorraine |title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |place=London |isbn=0-415-30885-2 |page=560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pornography ==
{{Main|Feminist views on pornography}}
The [[feminist sex wars]] is a term for the acrimonious debates within the feminist movement in the late 1970s through the 1980s around the issues of feminism, sexuality, sexual representation, [[pornography]], [[sadomasochism]], the role of [[transwomen]] in the lesbian community, and other sexual issues. The [[Feminist views on pornography|feminist debate on porn]] pitted [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]], and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates.&lt;ref name="Duggan"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Duggan, Lisa |author2=Hunter, Nan D. |title=Sex Wars: Sexual Dissent and Political Culture |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=0-415-91036-6 |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Hansen, Karen Tranberg; |author2=Philipson, Ilene J. |title=Women, Class, and the Feminist Imagination: A Socialist-Feminist Reader |year=1990 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=0-87722-630-X |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerhard"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Gerhard, Jane F. |title=Desiring Revolution: Second-Wave Feminism and the Rewriting of American Sexual Thought, 1920 to 1982 |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-11204-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leidholdt"&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Leidholdt, Dorchen; |authorlink=Dorchen Leidholdt |author2=Raymond, Janice G. |title=The Sexual Liberals and the Attack on Feminism |year=1990 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |isbn=0-08-037457-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vance"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Vance, Carole S. |title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality |publisher=Thorsons Publishers|isbn=0-04-440593-6 |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-pornography movement ===
[[Anti-pornography movement#Feminist objections|Anti-pornography feminists]], such as [[Catharine MacKinnon]], [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Robin Morgan]], and [[Dorchen Leidholdt]], put [[pornography]] at the center of a feminist explanation of women's oppression.&lt;ref name="XXX"&gt;{{Cite book |author=McElroy, Wendy |title=XXX: A Woman's Right to Pornography |year=1995 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |location=New York |isbn=0-312-13626-9 |page=243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some feminists, such as [[Diana E. H. Russell|Diana Russell]], [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Catharine MacKinnon]], [[Susan Brownmiller]], [[Dorchen Leidholdt]], [[Ariel Levy (journalist)|Ariel Levy]], [[Robin Morgan]], and [[Feminists Fighting Pornography|Page Mellish]], argue that pornography is degrading of women and complicit in [[violence against women]] both in its production (whereby, they charge, abuse and exploitation of women performing in pornography is rampant) and in its consumption (whereby, they charge, pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in [[rape]] and [[sexual harassment]]).&lt;ref name= "Dworkin"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dworkin, Andrea |authorlink=Andrea Dworkin |title=Pornography: Men Possessing Women |year=1989 |publisher=Plume |location=New York |isbn=0-452-26793-5 |page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1970s, [[Feminist views on pornography#Anti-pornography feminism|anti-pornography]] [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] formed organizations such as [[Women Against Pornography]] and [[Feminists Fighting Pornography]] that provided educational events, including slide-shows, speeches, and guided tours of the sex industry in [[Times Square]], [[New York City]], in order to raise awareness of the content of pornography and the sexual subculture in pornography shops and live sex shows.&lt;ref name="Brownmiller"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Brownmiller, Susan |title=In Our Time: Memoir of a Revolution |year=1999 |publisher=Dial Press |location=New York |isbn=0-385-31486-8 |page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrea Dworkin and Robin Morgan began articulating a vehemently anti-porn stance based in radical feminism beginning in 1974 and anti-porn feminist groups, such as [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]] in San Francisco, became highly active in various U.S. cities during the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Dworkin" /&gt;

=== Sex-positive movement ===
{{Main|Sex-positive feminism}}
[[Sex-positive feminism]] is a movement that was formed in order to address issues of women's sexual pleasure, freedom of expression, [[sex work]], and inclusive gender identities. [[Ellen Willis]]' 1981 essay, "Lust Horizons: Is the Women's Movement Pro-Sex?" is the origin of the term, "pro-sex feminism"; the more commonly used variant, "sex positive feminism" arose soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Willis |first=Ellen |date=1981-06-17 |title=Lust Horizons: Is the Women's Movement Pro-Sex?|periodical = [[Village Voice]]|issue=17 June 1981|doi=|oclc = |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although some sex-positive feminists, such as [[Betty Dodson]], were active in the early 1970s, much of sex-positive feminism largely began in the late 1970s and 1980s as a response to the increasing emphasis in radical feminism on anti-pornography activism.

Sex-positive feminists are also strongly opposed to radical feminist calls for legislation against pornography, a strategy they decried as [[censorship]], and something that could, they argued, be used by social conservatives to censor the sexual expression of women, gay people, and other sexual minorities. The initial period of intense debate and acrimony between sex-positive and anti-pornography feminists during the early 1980s is often referred to as the [[feminist sex wars]]. Other sex-positive feminists became involved not in opposition to other feminists but in direct response to what they saw as patriarchal control of sexuality.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

== Sex work and sex industry ==
{{Main|Feminist views on prostitution}}
Feminist views on sex work and prostitution vary. Feminist supporters of [[sex worker rights]] and decriminalization argue that women's right to control their own bodies and sexuality includes the right to engage in consensual sexual commerce. They also argue that criminalization and social stigmatization of [[sex work]] and sex workers only worsens the existing marginalization and victimization that sex workers are often subjected to. On the other hand, feminist opponents of prostitution argue that prostitution is so tangled with forced prostitution, [[human trafficking]], exploitation, and violence as to be inseparable from these ills in practice. They also argue that prostitution and other forms of sex work are inherently a product of [[patriarchy]] and [[sexism]], and that the presence even of consensual sex work is harmful to society and women in particular. While feminists across all positions generally agree that direct criminalization of women in prostitution should be ended, there is little or no consensus on much else on the topics of legal approaches to the sex trade, the status of sex workers, or the nature of sex work itself.&lt;!-- citation needed --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2525">'''Free play''' ({{lang-fr|jeu libre}}) is a literary concept from [[Jacques Derrida]]'s 1966 essay, "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences." In his essay, Derrida speaks of a philosophical "[[Event (philosophy)|event]]" that has occurred to the historic foundation of structure. Before the “event,” man was the center of all things. After the “event,” however, man could no longer be judged the center of the universe. Without this centralized reference, all that is left is “free play.”

&lt;blockquote&gt;[U]p until the event which I wish to mark out and define, structure—or rather the structurality of structure—although it has always been involved, has always been neutralized or reduced, and this by a process of giving it a center or referring it to a point of presence, a fixed origin. The function of this center was not only to orient, balance, and organize the structure—one cannot in fact conceive of an unorganized structure—but above all to make sure that the organizing principle of the structure would limit what we might call the freeplay of the structure. No doubt that by orienting and organizing the coherence of the system, the center of a structure permits the freeplay of its elements inside the total form. And even today the notion of a structure lacking any center represents the unthinkable itself.&lt;br&gt;— "Structure, Sign and Play" in ''Writing and Difference'', p. 278&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Besides the tension of freeplay with history, there is also the tension of freeplay with presence. Freeplay is the disruption of presence. The presence of an element is always a signifying and substitutive reference inscribed in a system of differences and the movement of a chain. Freeplay is always an interplay of absence and presence, but if it is to be radically conceived, freeplay must be conceived of before the alternative of presence and absence; being must be conceived of as presence or absence beginning with the possibility of freeplay and not the other way around.&lt;br&gt;—"Structure, Sign and Play" in ''Writing and Difference'', p. 294&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Geometrical frustration occurs when a set of [[degrees of freedom]] is incompatible with the [[Space (mathematics)|space]] it occupies.

A purely [[geometry|geometric]] example of this is the impossibility of close-packing [[pentagon]]s in [[Two-dimensional space|two dimensions]]. Another is atomic [[magnetic moment]]s with [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] interactions. These [[Moment (mathematics)|moments]] lower their [[interaction energy]] by pointing [[antiparallel (mathematics)|antiparallel]] to their neighbors.

In the case of two dimensional space, the [[triangular lattice]] is the simplest example of such frustration. With a triangular [[Lattice (group)|lattice]], the two spins can easily accommodate two sides, but the third spin is frustrated. If this third spin is up, then two arrangements out of the three are compatible, but one is incompatible. This leads to a huge degeneracy in the [[ground state]] with non-zero [[entropy]]. This frustration leads to breaking [[symmetry]], which leads to [[ferroelectricity]].

Eric Drexler|Eric Drexler]] in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of Creation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Apocalypse 2012 |last= Joseph |first= Lawrence E. |authorlink= |year= 2007 |publisher= Broadway |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-7679-2448-1 |page= 6 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 he stated, "I wish I had never used the term 'gray goo'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/429591b |pmid=15190320 |title=Nanotech takes small step towards burying 'grey goo' |year=2004 |last1=Giles |first1=Jim |journal=Nature |volume=429 |issue=6992 |pages=591|url=http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038%2F429591b}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Engines of Creation'' mentions "gray goo" in two paragraphs and a note, while the popularized idea of gray goo was first publicized in a mass-circulation magazine, ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'', in November 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metamodern.com/b/wp-content/uploads/docs/OMNI_TINYTECH.pdf Nanotechnology: Molecular Machines that Mimic Life, OMNI, Vol. 9 No. 6, November 1986, p. 56ff.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The term was first used by molecular nanotechnology pioneer [[Eric Drexler]] in his book ''[[Engines of Creation]]'' (1986). In Chapter 4, ''Engines Of Abundance'', Drexler illustrates both [[exponential growth]] and inherent limits (not gray goo) by describing [[nanomachines]] that can function only if given special raw materials:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Imagine such a replicator floating in a bottle of chemicals, making copies of itself...the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four, and the eight build another eight. At the end of ten hours, there are not thirty-six new replicators, but over 68 billion. In less than a day, they would weigh a ton; in less than two days, they would outweigh the Earth; in another four hours, they would exceed the mass of the Sun and all the planets combined&amp;thinsp;—&amp;thinsp;if the bottle of chemicals hadn't run dry long before.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Drexler, the term was popularized by an article in science fiction magazine ''[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]]'', which also popularized the term ''nanotechnology'' in the same issue. Drexler says [[arms control]] is a far greater issue than grey goo "nanobugs".&lt;ref&gt;[https://youtube.com/watch?v=50iAoe7bs9o?t=3385 Dr Eric Drexler - Nanotechnology: The Big Picture]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] broadcast, a contrasting idea (a kind of gray goo) is referred to in a futuristic [[End time|doomsday]] scenario:
"In a common practice, billions of nanobots are released to clean up [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|an oil spill off the coast of Louisiana]]. However, due to a programming error, the nanobots devour all carbon based objects, instead of just the hydrocarbons of the oil. The nanobots destroy everything, all the while, replicating themselves. Within days, the planet is turned to dust."&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Drexler describes gray goo in Chapter 11 of ''Engines of Creation'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Early assembler-based replicators could beat the most advanced modern organisms. 'Plants' with 'leaves' no more efficient than today's solar cells could out-compete real plants, crowding the biosphere with an inedible foliage. Tough, omnivorous 'bacteria' could out-compete real bacteria: they could spread like blowing pollen, replicate swiftly, and reduce the biosphere to dust in a matter of days. Dangerous replicators could easily be too tough, small, and rapidly spreading to stop&amp;thinsp;—&amp;thinsp;at least if we made no preparation. We have trouble enough controlling viruses and fruit flies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Drexler notes that the geometric growth made possible by self-replication is inherently limited by the availability of suitable raw materials.

Drexler used the term "gray goo" not to indicate color or texture, but to emphasize the difference between "superiority" in terms of human values and "superiority" in terms of competitive success:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though masses of uncontrolled replicators need not be grey or gooey, the term "grey goo" emphasizes that replicators able to obliterate life might be less inspiring than a single species of crabgrass. They might be "superior" in an evolutionary sense, but this need not make them valuable.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Bill Joy]], one of the founders of Sun Microsystems, discussed some of the problems with pursuing this technology in his now-famous 2000 article in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine, titled "[[Why the Future Doesn't Need Us]]". In direct response to Joy's concerns, the first quantitative technical analysis of the [[ecophagy]] scenario was published in 2000 by nanomedicine pioneer [[Robert Freitas]].&lt;ref name="freitas"/&gt;

==Risks and precautions==
Drexler more recently conceded that there is no need to build anything that even resembles a potential runaway replicator. This would avoid the problem entirely. In a paper in the journal ''[[Nanotechnology (journal)|Nanotechnology]]'', he argues that self-replicating machines are needlessly complex and inefficient. His 1992 technical book on advanced nanotechnologies ''[[Nanosystems|Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.e-drexler.com/d/06/00/Nanosystems/toc.html |title=Nanosystems: molecular machinery, manufacturing, and computation |first=K. Eric |last=Drexler |publisher=Wiley |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-471-57518-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes manufacturing systems that are desktop-scale factories with specialized machines in fixed locations and conveyor belts to move parts from place to place. None of these measures would prevent a party from creating a weaponized grey goo, were such a thing possible.

[[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] called upon the British [[Royal Society]] to investigate the "enormous environmental and social risks" of nanotechnology in a planned report, leading to much media commentary on grey goo. The Royal Society's report on nanoscience was released on 29 July 2004, and declared the possibility of self-replicating machines to lie too far in the future to be of concern to regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nanotec.org.uk/finalReport.htm| title=Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties| publisher=The Royal Society| accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent analysis in the paper titled ''Safe Exponential Manufacturing'' from the [[Institute of Physics]] (co-written by Chris Phoenix, Director of Research of the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology, and Eric Drexler), shows that the danger of grey goo is far less likely than originally thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.crnano.org/PR-IOP.htm| date=9 June 2004| title=Leading nanotech experts put 'grey goo' in perspective| publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology| accessdate=2006-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other long-term major risks to society and the environment from nanotechnology have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.crnano.org/dangers.htm| title= Current Results of Our Research| publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology| accessdate=2006-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drexler has made a somewhat public effort to retract his grey goo hypothesis, in an effort to focus the debate on more realistic threats associated with knowledge-enabled nanoterrorism and other misuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3788673.stm| title=Nanotech guru turns back on 'goo'| publisher= BBC News|accessdate=2012-03-30|first=Paul|last=Rincon|date=2004-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Safe Exponential Manufacturing'', which was published in a 2004 issue of ''Nanotechnology'', it was suggested that creating manufacturing systems with the ability to self-replicate by the use of their own energy sources would not be needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Phoenix|first=Chris|author2=Eric Drexler|title=Safe Exponential Manufacturing|journal=Nanotechnology|date=August 2004|doi=10.1088/0957-4484/15/8/001 |volume=15|issue=8|pages=869–72|url=http://rachel.org/lib/safe_exponential_manufacturing.040601.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foresight Institute also recommended embedding controls in the molecular machines. These controls would be able to prevent anyone from purposely abusing nanotechnology, and therefore avoid the grey goo scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foresight.org/guidelines/current.html| title=Foresight Guidelines for Responsible Nanotechnology Development| publisher= Foresight Institute and IMM|accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and chaos==

Grey goo is a useful construct for considering low-probability, high-impact outcomes from emerging technologies. Thus, it is a useful tool in the [[ethics of technology]]. [[Daniel A. Vallero]] applied it as a worst-case scenario [[thought experiment]] for technologists contemplating possible risks from advancing a technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Biomedical Ethics for Engineers: Ethics and Decision Making in Biomedical and Biosystem Engineering|first=Daniel|last=Vallero |publisher=Academic Press |year=2007 |isbn=9780080476100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires that a [[decision tree]] or [[event tree]] include even extremely low probability events if such events may have an extremely negative and irreversible consequence, i.e. application of the [[precautionary principle]]. Dianne Irving admonishes that "any error in science will have a rippling effect..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Science, the formation of conscience and moral decision theory|last1=Irving |first1=Dianne|journal=Proceedings of the Guadalupan Appeal: The Dignity and Status of the Human Embryo, Mexico City, Mexico|date=October 28, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vallero adapted this reference to chaos theory to emerging technologies, wherein slight permutations of initial conditions can lead to unforeseen and profoundly negative downstream effects, for which the technologist and the new technology's proponents must be held accountable.

'''Henrik Palmgren''' is a Swedish [[alt-right]] political podcaster, vlogger, and YouTube personality.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-a-Student-Got-Kicked-Out/243549?key=tsxY_TWHW8qXB5a8zx2fCjFExZG2KdHSQXc_HzXGIWAjv9GyiV4kS55e30fdGFBoQ09JWTdBSXNjaGVzb0tkUnAycjdtLWRaRGR3cjdQUUVxNlB1Y2pfYkZkWQ|title=How a Student Got Kicked Out of Class —  and Became a Conservative Hero|date=2018-05-31|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=2018-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the alt-right website ''Red Ice'' in 2003.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Career ==
Palmgren launched the company Red Ice in 2002 in Gothenburg, Sweden as an outlet for [[conspiracy theories]] about [[Unidentified flying object|U.F.O.]]s, [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Freemasonry]], [[9/11 conspiracy theories|9/11]], and [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|The Illuminati]].&lt;ref name="darby-2"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Darby |first1=Seyward |title=The Rise of the Valkyries |url=https://harpers.org/archive/2017/09/the-rise-of-the-valkyries/2/ |accessdate=18 September 2018 |work=Harper's Magazine |date=September 2017 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 he began collaborating with [[Lana Lokteff]], an Oregon-based musician who was a listener to his internet radio show. They married in 2011.&lt;ref name="darby-8"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Darby |first1=Seyward |title=The Rise of the Valkyries |url=https://harpers.org/archive/2017/09/the-rise-of-the-valkyries/8/ |accessdate=18 September 2018 |work=Harper's Magazine |date=September 2017 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2012, Red Ice started shifting towards more racist conspiracy theories, such as the [[white genocide conspiracy theory]] and [[Holocaust denial]].&lt;ref name="darby-2"/&gt;

Palmgren is the host of the podcast and video program ''Red Ice Radio'', while Lokteff hosts ''Radio 3Fourteen''.&lt;ref name=NPR/&gt; Palmgren's program includes content promoting [[white nationalism]], [[anti-Semitism]], [[paranormal]] topics, holocaust revisionism, and [[far-right politics]].&lt;ref name="darby-2"/&gt; Palmgren's show has included guests such as [[Ingrid Carlqvist]], [[Richard B.

In May 2017, ''[[The Forward]]'' reported that Palmgren is collaborating with white nationalist [[Richard B. Spencer]] to form a new media company.&lt;ref&gt;Kestenbaum, Sam (May 3, 2017). [http://forward.com/fast-forward/370870/white-nationalist-richard-spencer-makes-alt-right-expansion-in-sweden/ White Nationalist Richard Spencer Makes ‘Alt-Right’ Expansion In Sweden], [[The Forward]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmgren took part in the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]].&lt;ref name="Englund"&gt;Englund, Tindra (14 August 2017) [http://www.dn.se/nyheter/varlden/svenska-hogerextremister-pa-plats-i-charlottesville/ Svenska högerextremister på plats i Charlottesville]. In: [[Dagens Nyheter]] (in Swedish).{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, Palmgren and Lotkeff, alongside several other alt-right figures including Goldy, were banned from the online money transfer service [[PayPal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thinkprogress.org/paypal-kicks-yet-more-white-nationalists-off-its-funding-site-6f359b586f72/|title=3 more prominent far-right accounts get de-platformed by PayPal|access-date=2018-09-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4044">[[Image:Homing pigeon.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[homing pigeon]]. These have been selectively bred to home over long distances.]]
'''Homing''' is the inherent ability of an [[animal]] to [[navigate]] towards an original [[location (geography)|location]] through unfamiliar areas. This location may be either a [[home territory]], or a breeding spot.

==Uses==
Homing abilities can be used to find the way back to home in a [[wikt:migration|migration]]. It is often used in reference to going back to a breeding spot seen years before, as in the case of [[salmon]]. Homing abilities can also be used to go back to familiar territory when displaced over long distances, such as with the [[red-bellied newt]].

==True navigation==
[[Image:Caretta caretta 060417w2.jpg|thumb|175px|right|[[Loggerhead sea turtle]]s home both using true navigation and magnetic orientation]]
{{see|Animal navigation}}

Some animals use true [[navigation]] for their homing. This means in familiar areas they will use landmarks such as roads, rivers or mountains when flying, or islands and other landmarks while swimming. However, this only works in familiar territory. [[Homing pigeon]]s, for example, will often navigate using familiar [[landmark]]s, such as roads.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3460977.stm BBC News: Pigeons reveal map-reading secret]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sea turtle]]s will also use landmarks to orient themselves.&lt;ref name=Avens&gt;Avens, L., (2003) "Homing Behavior, Navigation, and Orientation of Juvenile Sea Turtles" [https://web.archive.org/web/20090508214743/http://www.sefsc.noaa.gov/PDFdocs/Avens_Dissertation_2003.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magnetic orientation==
Many animals use [[magnetic]] orientation based on the [[Earth's magnetic field]] to find their way home. This is usually used together with other methods, such as a sun compass, as in [[Bird migration#Orientation and navigation|bird migration]] and in the case of turtles. This is also commonly used when no other methods are available, as in the case of [[lobster]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Lohmann, K., Pentcheff, N., Nevitt, G., Stetten, G., Zimmer-Faust, R., Jarrard H., and Boles, L., (1995) ''Magnetic orientation of spiny lobsters in the ocean: experiments with undersea coil systems'' The Journal of Experimental Biology '''198'''(10); pg. 2041–2048&lt;/ref&gt; which live underwater, and [[Blesmol|mole rat]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Kimchi, T., and Terkel, J., (2001) ''Magnetic compass orientation in the blind mole rat Spalax ehrenbergi'' The Journal of Experimental Biology '''204'''(4); pg. 751–758&lt;/ref&gt; which home through their underground [[burrow]]s.

==Celestial orientation==
Celestial orientation, navigation using the stars, is commonly used for homing. Displaced [[marbled newt]]s, for example, can only home when stars are visible.&lt;ref&gt;Diego-Rasilla, J., and Luengo, R., (2002) ''Journal of Ethology'' '''20'''(1):137–141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Olfaction==
There is evidence that [[olfaction]], or smell, is used in homing with several salamanders, such as the [[red-bellied newt]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, D., Anderson, O., and Twitty, V. (1968) "Homing Orientation by Olfaction in Newts (Taricha rivularis)" ''Science'' '''160'''(3834):1354–1356&lt;/ref&gt; Olfaction is also necessary for the homing of [[salmon]].&lt;ref&gt;Stabell, O. (1984) "Homing and olfaction in Salmonids: a critical review with special reference to the Atlantic Salmon" ''Biological Reviews'' '''59'''(3):333–388&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topographic memory==
Topographic memory, memory of the contours surrounding the destination, is one common method for navigation. This is mainly used by animals with less intelligence, such as molluscs. [[Limpet]]s use this to find their way back to the home scrape; although whether this is true homing has been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Villee, C., and Groody, T., (1940) ''American Midland Naturalist''; '''24'''(1):190–204&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For the village in Nepal see [[Hukam, Nepal]]''
{{Sikhism sidebar}}

'''Hukam''' ({{lang-pa| ਹੁਕਮਿ}}) is a [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] word derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''[[hukm]]'', meaning "command" or "divine order."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=YOI1nB_zTyAC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=Hukam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiApNqc3q3QAhUH5oMKHTN1BtQQ6AEIMjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Hukam&amp;f=false|title=Sikhism|last=Haar|first=Kristen|last2=Kalsi|first2=Sewa Singh|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438106472|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sikhism, Hukam represents the goal of becoming in harmony with the will of God and thus attaining inner peace.  It also designates the practice of opening up at random to a page in the Sikh scripture (Guru Granth Sahib) to receive God's guidance on how to handle a certain situation, as answer to a question, or as more general guidance for that day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20488">'''Human rights defenders''' or '''human rights activists''' are people who, individually or with others, act to promote or protect [[human rights]]. They can be journalists, environmentalists, whistle-blowers, trade unionists, lawyers, teachers, housing campaigners, and so on. They can defend rights as part of their jobs or in a voluntary capacity. As a result of their activities, they can sometimes be the subject of reprisals and attacks of all kinds, including smears, surveillance, harassment, false charges, arbitrary detention, restrictions on the right to freedom of association, and physical attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act30/6011/2017/en/|title=Human rights defenders under threat - A shrinking space for civil society|last=Amnesty International|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Declaration on Human Rights Defenders==
The [[United Nations]] Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized [[human rights|Human Rights]] and [[fundamental freedoms|Fundamental Freedoms]] (A/RES/53/144) on December 9, 1998, commonly known as the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ishr.ch/un-declaration |title=UN Human Rights Defenders |publisher=Ishr.ch |date=2013-11-20 |accessdate=2014-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; marks a historic achievement in the struggle toward better protection of those at risk for carrying out legitimate [[human rights]] activities and is the first UN instrument that recognizes the importance and legitimacy of the work of human rights defenders, as well as the right and responsibility of all to protect human rights.

The Declaration codifies the international standards that protect the activity of human rights defenders around the world. It recognises the legitimacy of human rights activity and the need for this activity and those who carry it out to be protected. Under the Declaration, a human rights defender is anyone working alone, as part of group or an institution,  working for the promotion and protection of human rights. This broad definition encompasses professional as well as non-professional human rights workers, [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[lawyer]]s and anyone else carrying out, even on an occasional basis, a human rights activity.

The Declaration articulates existing rights in a way that makes it easier to apply them to the situation of human rights defenders. It specifies how the rights contained in the major human rights instruments, including the [[right of free expression]], association and assembly, apply to defenders.

The rights protected under the Declaration include, among others,  the right to develop and discuss new human rights ideas and to advocate their acceptance; the right to criticise government bodies and agencies and to make proposals to improve their functioning; the right to provide legal assistance or other advice and assistance in defence of human rights; the [[right to fair trial|right to observe fair trials]]; the right to unhindered access to and communication with [[non-governmental]] and [[intergovernmental organisations]]; the right to access resources for the purpose of protecting human rights, including the receipt of funds from abroad.

States have a responsibility to implement and respect all the provisions of the Declaration. In particular, states have the duty to protect human rights defenders against any violence, retaliation and intimidation as a consequence of their human rights work.

==Protection instruments==
Following the adoption of the Declaration on human rights defenders in 1998, a number of initiatives were taken, both at the international and regional level, to increase the protection of defenders and contribute to the implementation of the Declaration. In this context, the following mechanisms and guidelines were established:

*The mandate of the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] on human rights defenders (2000)
*The mandate of the Special Rapporteur of the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] on human rights defenders (2004)
*The Human Rights Defenders Unit of the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]] (2001)
*The [[European Union]] Guidelines on human rights defenders (2004)
*The Declaration of the Committee of Ministers on Council of Europe action to improve the protection of human rights defenders and promote their activities [https://search.coe.int/cm/Pages/result_details.aspx?ObjectID=09000016805d3e52] (2008)
*The European Union Human Rights Defenders mechanism, which is implemented by civil society organizations, [https://protectdefenders.eu/en/ ProtectDefenders.eu] (2015)

In 2008, the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, a joint programme of the [[International Federation for Human Rights]] (FIDH) and the [[World Organisation Against Torture]] (OMCT), took the initiative to gather all the human rights defenders’ institutional mandate-holders (created within the United Nations, the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Council of Europe, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Union) to find ways to enhance coordination and complementarities among themselves and with NGOs. In 2010, a single inter-mechanisms website&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrights-defenders.org humanrights-defenders.org]&lt;/ref&gt; was created, gathering all relevant public information on the activities of the different human rights defenders’ protection mandate-holders. It aims to increase the visibility of the documentation produced by the mechanisms (press releases, studies, reports, statements), as well as of their actions (country visits, institutional events, trials observed).

In 2016, the [[International Service for Human Rights]] published the 'Model National Law on the Recognition and Protection of Human Rights Defenders'.[https://www.ishr.ch/news/model-law] This document provides authoritative guidance to states on how to implement the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders at the national level. It was developed in collaboration with hundreds of defenders and endorsed by leading human rights experts and jurists.

Several countries have introduced national legislation or policies to protect human rights defenders, such as Colombia Brazil, Mexico, Guatemala, but key challenges in implementation remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/amr01/6211/2017/en/|title=Americas: State protection mechanisms for human rights defenders|last=Amnesty International|first=|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Human rights lawyer Emil Kurbedinov,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kyivpost.com/business/russian-held-crimea-lawyer-fights-repression-crimean-tatars.html|title=In Russian-held Crimea, lawyer fights repression against Crimean Tatars - Apr. 03, 2017|date=2017-04-03|work=KyivPost|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Crimean Tartar, won the 2017 Award for Frontline Human Rights Defenders at Risk. Kurbedinov has been an avid defender of civil society militants, mistreated Crimean Tartars, and members of the media. He documents violations of human rights during searches of activists’ residences as well as emergency responses. In January 2017, the Crimean Center for Counteracting Extremism&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://khpg.org/en/index.php?id=1490184936|title=Menacing FSB interrogations of Ukrainian Cultural Centre activists in Russian-occupied Crimea - Human Rights in Ukraine|work=Human Rights in Ukraine|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; arrested and detained the lawyer. He was taken to a local facility of the Russian Federal Security Service&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://government.ru/en/department/113/|title=Federal Security Service - The Russian Government|website=government.ru|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for questioning.  A district tribunal ruled that Kurbedinov was guilty of doing propaganda work for terrorist groups and organizations. He was sentenced to 10 days of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rightsinrussia.info/person-of-the-week/emilkurbedinov-1|title=Person of the Week: Emil Kurbedinov - Rights in Russia|website=www.rightsinrussia.info|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the same year, female activists who were killed because of their advocacies and activities in defending human rights were honored during the International Women Human Rights Defenders’ Day. Those murdered criticized corruption and other forms of injustice, protect their lands from governments and multinational corporations, and upheld the rights of lesbians, gays and transgender individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/nov/29/remembering-women-killed-fighting-for-human-rights-in-2017|title=Remembering women killed fighting for human rights in 2017|last=Sekyiamah|first=Nana Darkoa|last2=Ford|first2=Liz|date=2017-11-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research conducted by the Business and Human Rights Resource Center&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/library/581|title=Business and Human Rights Resource Centre {{!}} UN Global Compact|website=www.unglobalcompact.org|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; documented a 34 percent increase worldwide in attacks against human rights activists in 2017. The figures included 120 suspected murders and hundreds of incidents that involved assault, bullying, and threats. There were 388 attacks in 2017 compared to only 290 in 2016. The same study identified human rights defenders connected to agribusiness, mining, and renewable energy sectors as those in greatest danger. Lawyers and members of environmental groups were also at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/09/human-rights-activists-growing-risk-attacks-and-killings-study-claims|title='Attacks and killings': human rights activists at growing risk, study claims|last=Kelly|first=Annie|date=2018-03-09|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards for human rights defenders==
*The [[United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights]] in 1998.
*The [[Martin Ennals Award]], a collaboration of several human rights NGOs. [[Martin Ennals]] was a renowned human rights defender and secretary general of [[Amnesty International]]. Its secretariat is located at the [[OMCT]] office in Geneva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martinennalsaward.org/en/winners/index.html|title=Winner of the Martin Ennals Award 1994-2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The award carries a grant of at least 20,000 [[Swiss Francs]] (about 20,000 [[US dollars]]) to be used for further work in the field of human rights.
*The [[Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award]], established in 1984.
*The [[Sakharov Prize]], established in 1998 by the [[European Parliament]].  Laureates include: [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Malala Yousafzai|Malala Yousafza]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;i, the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]], [[Raif Badawi]].
*The [[Human rights defenders tulip|Human Rights Defenders Tulip]], established by the [[Netherlands]] government in 2008.
*Several human rights defenders have received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], such as imprisoned [[China|Chinese]] human rights activist [[Liu Xiaobo]] who won the [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize]] for his "long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China".
*The [[Front Line Defenders|Front Line Defenders Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk]], established in 2005 to 'honour the work of a human rights defender who, through non-violent work, is courageously making an outstanding contribution to the promotion and protection of the human rights of others.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Front Line Defenders Award|url=https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/en/front-line-defenders-award-human-rights-defenders-risk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Ginetta Sagan]] award for Women Human Rights Defenders, established in 1997 "to help women throughout the world in their struggle to overcome oppression, to let them know that they are not alone".[https://www.amnestyusa.org/about-us/grants-and-awards/ginetta-sagan-award/] Awardees include [[Hina Jilani]], [[Sonia Pierre]], [[Lydia Cacho]], Julienne Lusenge.

==Transnational advocacy networks==
Margaret E. Keck and Kathryn Sikkink, in “Activists Beyond Borders” define transnational advocacy networks as “…networks of activists, distinguishable largely by the centrality of principled ideas or values in motivating their formation.”&lt;ref&gt;Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. "Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politicals." [[Cornell University Press]], 1998,p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; This definition can be seen in many human rights organizations.

Keck and Sikkink write from a context before the universal availability of information technology and at this point the main actors are the States.&lt;ref&gt;Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. "Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politicals." Cornell University Press, 1998,p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; The boomerang pattern, argued by Keck and Sikkink, is a model of advocacy where a State A causes “blockage” by not protecting or violating rights.  Non-state actors provide other non-state actors from a State B with information about the blockage and those non-state actors inform State B.  State B places pressure on State A and/or has intergovernmental organizations place pressure on State A to change its policies.&lt;ref&gt;Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. "Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politicals." Cornell University Press, 1998,p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to facilitate transnational advocacy networks, the network needs to have common values and principles, access to information and be able to effectively use that information, believe their efforts will cause change and effectively frame their values.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. "Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politicals." Cornell University Press, 1998,p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Information use is historically very important to human rights organizations. Human rights methodology is considered “promoting change by promoting facts.”&lt;ref&gt;Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. "Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politicals." Cornell University Press, 1998,p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;  By using facts, state and non-state actors can use that viable information to pressure human rights violators.

Human rights advocacy networks focus on either countries or issues by targeting particular audiences in order to gain support.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;  To gain audience support human rights organizations need to cultivate relationships through networking, have access to resources and maintain an institutional structure.&lt;ref&gt;Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. "Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks in International Politicals." Cornell University Press, 1998,p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists commonly use four tactics in their advocacy efforts: 1) Information politics provides comprehensive and useful information on an issue that otherwise might not be heard from sources who otherwise might be overlooked; 2) Symbolic politics uses powerful symbolic events as a way to increase awareness surrounding an issue; 3) Leverage politics utilizes material leverage (examples such as goods, money, or votes), moral leverage (the "mobilization of shame") or both in order to gain influence over more powerful actors; 4) Accountability politics holds those who make commitments to a cause accountable for their actions or lack thereof.&lt;ref&gt;Keck, Margaret E., and Kathryn Sikkink. "Activists Beyond Borders: Advocacy Networks i2International Politicals." Cornell University Press, 1998,p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information technology and networked advocacy==
The widespread availability of the internet, mobile telephones, and related [[information and communications technology|communications technologies]] enabling users to [[Networked advocacy|overcome the transaction costs of collective action]] has begun to change the previous models of advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Clay Shirky|Shirky, Clay]]. ''[[Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing without Organizations]]''. New York: Penguin Group, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to information technology and its ability to provide an abundance of information, there are fewer to no costs for group forming.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Shirky, Clay. Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing without Organizations. New York: Penguin Group, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Coordination is now much easier for human rights organizations to track human rights violators and use the information to advocate for those in need.

One effect is that it is harder for governments to block information they do not want their citizens to obtain.  The increase in technology makes it nearly impossible for information not to penetrate everyone around the globe making it easier for human rights organizations to monitor and ensure rights are being protected.

In addition, the fact that the Internet provides a platform for easy group forming, the use of an institutional organization is not essential.  With social networking sites and blogs, any individual can perpetuate collective action with the right tools and audience.  The need for a hierarchy is diminishing with the great abundance of information available.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Electronic mapping==
Electronic mapping is a newly developed tool using electronic networks and [[satellite imagery]] and tracking.  Examples include tactical mapping, crisis mapping and geo-mapping.  Tactical mapping has been primarily used in tracking human rights abuses by providing visualization of the tracking and implementation monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;Movements.org.  “Maptivism: Mapping Information for Advocacy and Activism."&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwell, MA/New York: Kluwer/Plenum, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  Information diagrams are a useful pedagogical tool for teaching and learning about these basic measures of information, but using such diagrams carries some non-trivial implications.  For example, Shannon's entropy in the context of an information diagram must be taken as a [[signed measure]].  (See the article ''[[Information theory and measure theory]]'' for more information.)

[[Image:VennInfo3Var.svg|thumb|512px|left|[[Venn diagram]] of information theoretic measures for three variables x, y, and z. Each circle represents an individual [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]]: H(x) is the lower left circle, H(y) the lower right, and H(z) is the upper circle. The intersections of any two circles represents the [[mutual information]] for the two associated variables (e.g. I(x;z) is yellow and gray). The union of any two circles is the [[joint entropy]] for the two associated variables (e.g. H(x,y) is everything but green). The joint entropy H(x,y,z) of all three variables is the union of all three circles. It is partitioned into 7 pieces, red, blue, and green being the [[Conditional entropy|conditional entropies]] H(x&amp;#124;y,z), H(y&amp;#124;x,z), H(z&amp;#124;x,y) respectively, yellow, magenta and cyan being the [[conditional mutual information|conditional mutual informations]] I(x;z&amp;#124;y), I(y;z&amp;#124;x) and I(x;y&amp;#124;z) respectively, and gray being the [[multivariate mutual information]] I(x;y;z). The multivariate mutual information is the only one of all that may be negative.]]

'''Jewish political movements''' refer to the organized efforts of [[Jew]]s to build their own [[Political party|political parties]] or otherwise represent their interest in politics outside the [[Jewish community]]. From the time of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|siege of Jerusalem]] by the Romans to the foundation of [[Israel]] the Jewish people had no territory, and, until the 19th century they by-and-large were also denied equal rights in the countries in which they lived. Thus, until the 19th century effort for the [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation of the Jews]], almost all Jewish political struggles were internal, and dealt primarily with either religious issues or issues of a particular Jewish community. (See [[Judaism and politics]].){{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Birth of Jewish political movements==
[[Image:Moses Mendelson P7160073.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Moses Mendelssohn, the founder of the [[Haskalah]] movement]]
Since Jews were excluded as outsiders throughout Europe, they were mostly shut out of politics or any sort of participation in the wider political and social sphere of the nations in which they were involved until the Enlightenment, and its Jewish counterpart, [[Haskalah]], made popular movements possible. As long as the Jews lived in [[Religious segregation|segregated]] communities, and as long as all avenues of social intercourse with their [[gentile]] neighbors were closed to them, the [[rabbi]] was the most influential member of the Jewish community. In addition to being a religious scholar and clergy, a rabbi also acted as a civil [[judge]] in all cases in which both parties were Jews. Rabbis sometimes had other important administrative powers, together with the community elders. The rabbinate was the highest aim of many Jewish boys, and the study of the [[Torah]] (first five books of the Bible) and the [[Talmud]] was the means of obtaining that coveted position, or one of many other important communal distinctions. Haskalah followers advocated "coming out of the [[ghetto]]", not just physically but also mentally and spiritually.  The example of [[Moses Mendelssohn]]  (1729&amp;ndash;1786), a [[Prussia]]n Jew and grandfather of the composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]], served to lead this movement. Mendelssohn's extraordinary success as a popular philosopher and [[man of letters]] revealed hitherto unsuspected possibilities of integration and acceptance of Jews among non-Jews.

The changes caused by the Haskalah movement coincided with rising revolutionary movements throughout Europe.  Despite these movements, only France, Britain, and the Netherlands had granted the Jews in their countries equal rights with gentiles after the [[French Revolution]] in 1796.  Elsewhere in Europe, especially where Jews were most concentrated in Central and Eastern Europe, Jews were not granted equal rights. It was in the revolutionary atmosphere of the mid-19th century that the first true Jewish political movements would take place.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Emancipation movements==
{{see also|Jewish Emancipation|Haskalah}}
During the early stages of [[Jewish Emancipation|Jewish emancipation movements]], Jews were simply part of the general effort to achieve freedom and rights that drove popular uprisings like the [[Revolutions of 1848]]. Jewish statesmen and intellectuals like [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Johann Jacoby]], [[Gabriel Riesser]], [[Berr Isaac Berr]], and [[Lionel Nathan Rothschild]] were active with the general movement towards liberty and political freedom.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Still, in the face of persistent [[anti-semitic]] incidents like the [[Damascus affair|Damascus Blood Libel]] of 1840, and the failure of many states to emancipate the Jews, Jewish organizations started to form in order to push for the emancipation and protection of Jews.  The [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] under [[Moses Montefiore]], the [[Central Consistory]] of Paris, and the [[Alliance Israelite Universelle]] founded by [[Adolphe Crémieux]], all began working to assure the freedom of the Jews throughout the middle of the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Socialist and Labor movements==
{{see also|Jewish left}}
Frustration with the slow pace of Jewish acceptance into European society, and a revolutionary [[utopianism]], led to a growing interest in proto-[[socialism|socialist]] and [[communist]] movements, especially as early socialist leaders, like [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, Comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], preached the emancipation of the Jews. [[Moses Hess]] played a role in introducing [[Karl Marx]] (who was descended from a long line of rabbis) and [[Friedrich Engels]] to [[historical materialism]].  The Jewish [[Ferdinand Lassalle]], founded the first actual workers' party in Germany, the [[General German Workers' Association]] (which ultimately merged with other parties to become the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]) and made Jewish emancipation one of his goals.  {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The more intellectual socialist movements of the Jews in Western Europe never gathered steam as emancipation took hold. In Eastern Europe and Russia, however, the ''Bund''{{spaced ndash}}the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|General Jewish Labor Union]]{{spaced ndash}}founded in 1897, became a key force in organizing Jews, and, at least initially, the major opponent of another Jewish political movement of the time, [[Zionism]]. There were other Jewish socialist parties in Russia, like the ([[Jewish Territorialist Organization|territorialist]]) [[Zionist Socialist Workers Party]] and the [[Jewish Socialist Workers Party]], which united their destinies in 1917 as the [[United Jewish Socialist Workers Party]]. Another left-wing Russian Jewish party was the [[Jewish Social Democratic Labour Party (Poalei Zion)]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Zionist movements==
{{main|Zionism}}
The aim of Zionism was to set up a secular state in the vicinity of the Biblical [[Land of Israel]]. Zionism, or the idea of a restored national homeland and common identity for the Jews, had already started to take shape by the mid-19th century, with Jewish thinkers such as [[Moses Hess]] whose 1862 work ''Rome and Jerusalem; The Last National Question'' argued for the Jews to settle in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] as a means of settling the [[national question]]. Hess proposed a socialist state in which the Jews would become [[agrarianism|agrarianised]] through a process of "redemption of the soil" which would transform the Jewish community into a "true" nation, in that Jews would occupy the productive layers of society rather than being an intermediary non-productive merchant class, which is how he perceived Jews in Europe. Hess, along with later thinkers such as [[Nahum Syrkin]] and [[Ber Borochov]], is considered a founder of ''Socialist Zionism'' and [[Labour Zionism]] and one of the intellectual forebears of the [[kibbutz]] movement. Others like Rabbi Zvi Kalischer viewed a return to the Jewish homeland as the fulfillment of biblical prophecy through natural means.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

[[Image:Theodore Herzl.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Theodor Herzl]], a key figure in the development of Zionism]]
As the 19th century wore on, the persecution of the Jews in Eastern Europe where emancipation had not occurred to the extent it did in Western Europe (or at all) increased.  Starting with the state-sponsored massive [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Jewish]] [[pogroms]] following the assassination of [[Russian history, 1855-1892|Tsar Alexander II]], through the bloody pogroms of 1903 to 1906 who left thousands of Jews dead and many more wounded, continuing with the [[Dreyfus Affair]]  in [[France]] in 1894, Jews were profoundly shocked to see the continuing extent of [[anti-Semitism]] from Russia to France, a country which they thought of as the home of enlightenment and liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Robert. ''The Revolution of 1905 in Odessa: Blood on the Steps''. 1993, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the first, [[Judah Leib Pinsker]] published the pamphlet [[Auto-Emancipation]] on January 1, 1882.  The pamphlet became influential for the ''Political Zionism'' movement. The movement was to achieve momentum under the leadership of an Austrian-Jewish journalist, [[Theodor Herzl]], who published his pamphlet ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' ("The Jewish State") in 1896. Prior to the Dreyfus Affair, Herzl had been an assimilationist, but after seeing how France treated its loyal Jewish subjects, he proposed building a separate Jewish state. In 1897 Herzl organized the [[First Zionist Congress]] in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], which founded the [[World Zionist Organisation]] (WZO) and elected Herzl as its first President.  After the state's establishment Zionism, in its various forms, would become the largest Jewish political movement, although more Jews would participate in the national politics of the countries in which they resided.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Folkists==
{{see also|Jewish Autonomism}}
In the aftermath of the 1905 pogroms in Russia, the historian [[Simon Dubnow]] founded the [[Folkspartei]] (Yiddishe Folkspartay) which had some intellectual audience in Russia, then, in independent [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] in the 1920–1930s where it was represented as well in the Parliaments ([[Sejm]], [[Seimas]]) as in numerous municipal councils (incl. [[Warsaw]]) till in the late 1930s. The party did not survive the Shoah, the Holocaust.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Territorialists==
{{main|Jewish Territorialist Organization}}
The territorialists, who had split from the Zionists after the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905, called for creation of a sufficiently large and compact Jewish territory (or territories), not necessarily in the [[Land of Israel]] and not necessarily fully autonomous. Some territorialist leaders, such as [[Nachman Syrkin]], supported the [[Socialism|Socialist]] versions of [[Zionism]], while some others, such as [[Lucien Wolf]], actively opposed [[Zionism]] and promoted anti-nationalist ideas. [[Isaac Nachman Steinberg]], one of the founders of the [[Freeland League]], held anti-authoritarian socialist views, as well as his close friend [[Erich Fromm]], who supported Steinberg's territorialist ideas.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Anarchists==
{{main|Jewish Anarchism}}
While the Jews in general played an important role in the international anarchist movements, many Jewish anarchists actively promoted [[Yiddish]] language and culture, focused on specifically Jewish issues. While most Jewish anarchists were irreligious or even vehemently anti-religious, some Jewish anarchist and anti-authoritarian thinkers, such as [[Martin Buber]], rabbi [[Yehuda Ashlag]], [[Isaac Nachman Steinberg]] and [[Gustav Landauer]], were religious or religiously inclined and often referred to the Torah, Talmud and other traditional Judaic sources, claiming that anarchist ideas are deeply rooted in the Jewish tradition. The Jewish anarchists believe that in the stateless, free and diverse anarchist society the Jews would have more opportunities to express their individual and cultural autonomy. Many Jewish anarchists, while promoting universal [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] values, had actively participated in the development of the Yiddish culture and Jewish community life. {{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

There was some intersection between the Jewish anarchist, [[Folkism|Folkist]] and [[Jewish Territorialist Organization|Territorialist]] movements. For example, [[Isaac Nachman Steinberg]], a renowned Territorialist leader, held anarchist views. Most Jewish anarchists supported [[anarcho-syndicalism]] and [[communist anarchism]], while a few were individualist anarchists. The small contemporary [[Anarchism in Israel|anarchist movement in Israel]] is very active in [[Israeli peace camp|peace]] and Palestinian solidarity actions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Modern Jewish political movements==
Zionism continues to be the central trans-national political movement of most Jews, although it has split into a variety of branches and philosophies that span the political spectrum from left-wing to right-wing.  Jews are also active in government in many of the countries in which they live, as well as in Jewish community organizations that often take political positions.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===In Israel===
{{main|Politics of Israel}}
{{see also|List of political parties in Israel}}

===Outside Israel===
In the 20th century, Jews in Europe and the Americas traditionally tended towards the [[left-wing politics|political left]], and played key roles in the birth of the [[labor movement]] as well as [[socialism]].  While Diaspora Jews have also been represented in the [[conservatism|conservative]] side of the political spectrum, even politically conservative Jews have tended to support [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]] more consistently than many other elements of the [[right-wing politics|political right]].{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Daniel J. Elazar connects this pluralist tendency to the fact that Jews are not expected to proselytize, and argues that whereas [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] anticipate a single world-state, Judaism does not.[http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles2/jud-democ.htm]  This lack of a universalizing religion is combined with the fact that most Jews live as minorities in their countries, and that no central Jewish religious authority has existed for over 2,000 years. ''(See [[List of Jews#Politics|list of Jews in politics]], which illustrates the diversity of Jewish political thought and of the roles Jews have played in politics.)''

There are also a number of Jewish secular organizations at the local, national, and international levels.  These organizations often play an important part in the Jewish community.  Most of the largest groups, such as [[Hadassah]] and the [http://www.ujc.org/ United Jewish Communities], have an elected leadership.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}  No one secular group represents the entire Jewish community, and there is often significant internal debate among Jews about the stances these organizations take on affairs dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, such as antisemitism and Israeli policies.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} In the United States and Canada today, the mainly secular [[United Jewish Communities]] (UJC), formerly known as the [[United Jewish Appeal]] (UJA), represents over 150 [[Jewish Federations]] and 400 independent communities across North America. Every major American city has its local "Jewish Federation", and many have sophisticated community centers and provide services, mainly health care-related. They raise record sums of money for [[philanthropy|philanthropic]] and [[humanitarian]] causes in North America and Israel. Other organizations such as the [[Anti-Defamation League]], [[American Jewish Congress]], [[American Jewish Committee]], [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]], Zionist Organization of America, Americans for a safe Israel, [[B'nai B'rith]] and [[Agudath Israel of America|Agudath Israel]] represent different segments of the American Jewish community on a variety of issues.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The 21st century has brought changes in the political leanings of Jewish communities in the diaspora. In the U.S. and Canada, the two largest Jewish diaspora communities, voters are shifting from liberal to more conservative leanings. in 2011 an Ipsos Reid exit poll of voters in the federal election of Canada found that 52 per cent of Jewish voters supported the Conservatives, 24 per cent the Liberals and 16 per cent the NDP, reflecting " an enormous shift in voter preference among Canadian Jews." The shift appears to reflect an alignment with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition government and its views on Israel’s security.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/how-the-political-shift-among-jewish-voters-plays-in-canada/article4199522/ How the political shift among Jewish voters plays in Canada], The Globe and Mail, 28 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish community in Great Britain is also leaning conservative in the 21st century as a poll published by the Jewish Chronicle in early 2015 shows. Of British Jews polled, 69% would vote for the Conservative Party, while 22% would vote for the Labour Party.  This is in stark contrast to the rest of the voter population, which according to a BBC poll had Conservatives and Labor almost tied at about a third each. Jews have typically been a part of the British middle class, traditional home of the Conservative Party, though the number of Jews in working class communities of London is in decline. The main voting bloc of poorer Jews in Britain now, made up primarily of ultra-Orthodox, votes "en masse" for the Conservatives. Attitudes toward [[Israel]] influence the vote of three out of four of British Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/133505/huge-majority-british-jews-will-vote-tory-jc-poll-reveals Huge majority of British Jews will vote Tory, JC poll reveals] The JC.com, 7 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.forward.com/forward-thinking/218262/how-ed-miliband-lost-britains-jewish-voters/ How Ed Miliband Lost Britain's Jewish Voters] The Jewish Daily Forward, 8 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Joy Bale Boone''' (October 29, 1912 – October 3, 2002) was an American poet best known for her devotion to the arts. She was also active in the [[women's liberation movement]] throughout her life. Although she was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]] Boone spent most of her life in [[Kentucky]].

==Life and career==
Boone became interested in poetry at a very young age. As a young girl, she attended the Chicago Latin School and then went on to [[Roycemore School]] for girls. Boone received inspiration as a young girl from poet [[Harriet Monroe]], who lived just a few blocks away from her as a child. Bale Boone came to Kentucky to begin her career in writing after she met her husband, Shelby Garnett Bale. The two met in Chicago while Garnett Bale was attending medical school at [[Northwestern University]]. They were married in 1934. In the first few years of their marriage, the couple lived in both New York and Louisville while Garnett Bale finished his residencies.

In 1944, Boone formed the League of Women Voters in Hardin County, Kentucky. and served as its first president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bale Boone's first job in Kentucky came in 1945 as a book reviewer for the [[Louisville Courier-Journal]]. In 1964, Boone went on to found the literary magazine ''Approaches''. She held the position of editor of the magazine until 1975. She was also the editor for the 1964 and 1967 ''Contemporary Poetry'' collections. Bale Boone has had many individual poems published, but her most significant work was ''The Storm's Eye: A Narrative in Verse Celebrating Cassius Marcellus Clay, Man of Freedom 1810–1903.'' Her two collections of poetry include: ''Never Less Than Love'' (1972) and ''Even Without Love'' (1992). Boone received the Distinguished Kentuckian Award from [[KET]] in 1974. She also received the Sullivan Award from the [[University of Kentucky]] in 1969. Finally, in 1997, Boone was honored by being named the [[Poet Laureate of Kentucky]].&lt;!--"Poet Laureate History." Kentucky Arts Council. Kentucky Department for Libraries and Archives and the Kentucky Arts Council, 9 August 2010. Accessed 24 November 2010.--&gt;&lt;ref name="artscouncil1"&gt;[http://artscouncil.ky.gov/Poet/Poet_History.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124145407/http://artscouncil.ky.gov/Poet/Poet_History.htm |date=November 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boone spent most her life in [[Elizabethtown, Kentucky]] with her first husband, physician Shelby Garnett Bale. The couple had four sons and two daughters. Shelby Garnett Bale (Senior) died in 1972. In 1975, Boone married [[George Street Boone]] of Elkton. After marrying, she spent many years residing in [[Elkton, Kentucky]] where she continued to write and actively serve the state of Kentucky through the arts.

After suffering from an illness for some time, Boone died in [[Glasgow, Kentucky]] on Tuesday, October 3, 2002, at the age of 89.

==The arts==
Boone dedicated her life to the arts. Throughout her life, she served on numerous committees and boards in hopes that more people would have the opportunity to experience the arts in the way that she had. She served as President of the Friends of Kentucky Libraries; in this role, she spearheaded the creation of the bookmobile, which is still used today to deliver books to those who are unable to come to the library. She served on many other boards and committees, these include: the Kentucky Educational Television Advisory Board, Kentucky Council on Higher Education (now the [[Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education]]), Editorial Board of the [[University Press of Kentucky]], the [[Kentucky Humanities Council]], chair of the Robert Penn Warren Committee at [[Western Kentucky University]], board member the Robert Penn Warren Circle at [[Duke University]], director of the Thomas Clark Foundation of the University Press of Kentucky, and the Gaines Center for the Humanities at the [[University of Kentucky]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2142">In [[robotics]] and [[motion planning]], '''kinodynamic planning''' is a class of problems for which [[velocity]],  [[acceleration]], and force/torque bounds must be satisfied, together with kinematic constraints such as avoiding obstacles.  The term was coined by [[Bruce Donald]], Pat Xavier, John Canny, and John Reif.&lt;ref name=Donald1993&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donald et al. developed the first [[polynomial-time approximation scheme]]s (PTAS) for the problem. By providing a  provably [[polynomial-time]] [[ε-approximation algorithm]], they resolved a long-standing open problem in optimal control. Their first paper considered time-optimal control  ("fastest path") of a point mass under Newtonian dynamics, amidst polygonal (2D) or polyhedral  (3D) obstacles, subject to  state  bounds on position, velocity, and acceleration. Later they extended the technique to many other cases, for example, to 3D open-chain kinematic robots under full Lagrangian dynamics. More recently, many  practical [[heuristic algorithm]]s  based on stochastic optimization and iterative sampling were developed, by a wide range of authors, to address the kinodynamic planning problem. These techniques for kinodynamic planning have been shown to work well in practice. However,  none of these heuristic techniques can guarantee the optimality of the computed solution (i.e., they have no performance guarantees), and  none can be mathematically proven to be faster than the original PTAS algorithms (i.e., none have a provably lower computational complexity).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29692">'''New Sincerity''' (closely related to and sometimes described as synonymous with [[post-postmodernism]]) is a trend in [[music]], [[aesthetics]], [[literary fiction]], [[film criticism]], [[poetry]], [[literary criticism]] and [[philosophy]]. It generally describes creative works that expand upon and break away from concepts of [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] [[irony]] and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], representing a partial return to [[modernism]]. Its usage dates back to the mid-1980s; however, it was popularized in the 1990s by [[United States|American]] author [[David Foster Wallace]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;David Foster Wallace, [http://jsomers.net/DFW_TV.pdf "E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Iain|date=2015-05-27|title=(New) Sincerity in David Foster Wallace's "Octet"|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00111619.2014.899199|journal=Critique: Studies in Contemporary Fiction|volume=56|issue=3|pages=299–314|doi=10.1080/00111619.2014.899199|issn=0011-1619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In music==
"New Sincerity" was used as a collective name for a loose group of [[alternative rock]] bands, centered in [[Austin, Texas]] in the years from about 1985 to 1990, who were perceived as reacting to the ironic outlook of then-prominent music movements like [[punk rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]]. The use of "New Sincerity" in connection with these bands began with an off-handed comment by Austin punk rocker/author [[Jesse Sublett]] to his friend, local music writer [[Margaret Moser]]. According to author Barry Shank, Sublett said: "All those new sincerity bands, they're crap."&lt;ref name="Shank"&gt;Barry Shank, [https://books.google.com/books?as_isbn=9780819562760 ''Dissonant Identities: The Rock'N'Roll Scene in Austin, Texas''] ([[Wesleyan University Press]], 1994) ({{ISBN|9780819562760}}), p. 148–149 &amp; p.271 n.84. ([https://books.google.com/books?id=v79of-KXnfgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=crap&amp;pg=RA1-PA171#v=snippet&amp;q=%22all%20those%20new%20sincerity%20bands%22&amp;f=false excerpt available] at [[Google Books]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Sublett (at his own website) states that he was misquoted, and actually told Moser, "It's all new sincerity to me... It's not my cup of tea."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100122071814/http://jessesublett.wordpress.com/the-skunks-the-band-that-blasted-austin-out-of-the-1970s/ "Jesse's Music Bio"] at [http://jessesublett.wordpress.com/ ''Jesse Sublett's Little Black Book''] (retrieved September 18, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;  In any event, Moser began using the term in print, and it ended up becoming the catch phrase for these bands.&lt;ref name="Shank" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Blackstock, [http://www.nodepression.net/blogs/peter/2008/01/_is_it_worth_the_admission.html "'is it worth the admission....'"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204134302/http://www.nodepression.net/blogs/peter/2008/01/_is_it_worth_the_admission.html |date=2008-12-04 }}, ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' blog post dated January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Regarding [[Jesse Sublett]] and his band, [[The Skunks]], ''see'' Ken Lieck, [http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A79685 "Young, Loud, and Cheap: The Skunks, the Band That Broke Austin Out of the Seventies"], ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'', December 8, 2000, ''and'' Jesse Sublett, ''Never the Same Again: A Rock 'N' Roll Gothic'' (Ten Speed Press, 2004), {{ISBN|978-1-58008-598-4}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=-6yPxcrGqfMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Jesse%20Sublett&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false excerpts available] at [[Google Books]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationally, the most successful "New Sincerity" band was [[The Reivers (band)|The Reivers]] (originally called Zeitgeist), who released four well-received albums between 1985 and 1991. [[True Believers (band)|True Believers]], led by [[Alejandro Escovedo]] and [[Jon Dee Graham]], also received extensive critical praise and local acclaim in Austin, but the band had difficulty capturing its live sound on recordings, among other problems.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p27102|pure_url=yes}} True Believers] at [[Allmusic]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other important "New Sincerity" bands included [[Doctors Mob]],&lt;ref&gt;Kent H. Benjamin, [http://weeklywire.com/ww/08-30-99/austin_music_feature2.html "Why Should Anyone Care Now?"], ''[[Austin Chronicle]] Weekly Wire'' August 30, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p26360|pure_url=yes}} Doctors Mob] at [[Allmusic]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wild Seeds]],&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p27169|pure_url=yes}} Wild Seeds] at [[Allmusic]].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Glass Eye (band)|Glass Eye]].&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4370|pure_url=yes}} Glass Eye] at [[Allmusic]].&lt;/ref&gt; Another significant "New Sincerity" figure was the eccentric, critically acclaimed songwriter [[Daniel Johnston]].&lt;ref name="Shank" /&gt;

Despite extensive critical attention (including national coverage in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and a 1985 episode of the [[MTV]] program ''[[I.R.S. Records Presents The Cutting Edge|The Cutting Edge]]''), none of the "New Sincerity" bands met with much commercial success, and the "scene" ended within a few years.&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Gorski, [http://annabellemagazine.com/annabelle%20issue%2012/08Z.html Almost Famous: The Austin Texas Soundtrack Circa 1985], ''Annabelle Magazine'', No. 12 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Corcoran, "The New Sincerity: Austin in the Eighties", reprinted in Michael Corcoran, ''All Over the Map: True Heroes of Texas Music'' (University of Texas Press, 2005), {{ISBN|978-0-292-70976-8}}, pp. 150–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film criticism==
Critic Jim Collins introduced the concept of "new sincerity" to film criticism in his 1993 essay entitled “Genericity in the 90s: Eclectic Irony and the New Sincerity”. In this essay he contrasts films that treat genre conventions with "eclectic irony" and those that treat them seriously, with "new sincerity". Collins describes&lt;blockquote&gt;
the 'new sincerity' of films like ''[[Field of Dreams]]'' (1989), ''[[Dances With Wolves]]'' (1990), and ''[[Hook (film)|Hook]]'' (1991), all of which depend not on hybridization, but on an "ethnographic" rewriting of the classic genre film that serves as their inspiration, all attempting, using one strategy or another, to recover a lost "purity", which apparently pre-existed even the Golden Age of film genre.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Collins, “Genericity in the 90s: Eclectic Irony and the New Sincerity” in Jim Collins, Hilary Radner and Ava Preacher Collins, eds., [https://books.google.com/books?id=oDwTPU8l2RQC ''Film Theory Goes to the Movies''] (New York: Routledge, 1993) ({{ISBN|0415905761}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-90576-3}}), p. 242, 245.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other critics have suggested "new sincerity" as a descriptive term for work by American filmmakers such as [[Wes Anderson]], [[Paul Thomas Anderson]], [[Todd Louiso]], [[Sofia Coppola]], [[Charlie Kaufman]], [[Zach Braff]], and [[Jared Hess]],&lt;ref&gt;Brannon M. Hancock, [http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Vol9No2/HancockCommunity.htm "A Community of Characters – the Narrative Self in the Films of Wes Anderson"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724015633/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/Vol9No2/HancockCommunity.htm |date=2008-07-24 }}, ''The Journal of Religion and Film'', vol. 9, no. 2 (October 2005), citing Mark Olsen, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1069/is_1_35/ai_53705833/pg_1?tag=artBody;col1 "If I Can Dream: The Everlasting Boyhoods of Wes Anderson"], ''[[Film Comment]]'', 35/1 (January/February 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; and filmmakers from other countries such as [[Michel Gondry]], [[Lars von Trier]], the [[Dogme 95]] movement, [[Aki Kaurismäki]], and [[Pedro Almodóvar]].&lt;ref name="Yurchak"&gt;Alexei Yurchak, "Post-Post-Communist Sincerity: Pioneers, Cosmonauts, and Other Soviet Heroes Born Today", in Thomas Lahusen and Peter H.

"&lt;ref name="Yurchak" /&gt;

==In literary fiction and criticism ==
In response to the hegemony of metafictional and self-conscious irony in contemporary fiction, writer [[David Foster Wallace]] predicted, in his 1993 essay "E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; a new literary movement which would espouse something like the New Sincerity ethos:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The next real literary “rebels” in this country might well emerge as some weird bunch of anti-rebels, born oglers who dare somehow to back away from ironic watching, who have the childish gall actually to endorse and instantiate single-entendre principles. Who treat of plain old untrendy human troubles and emotions in U.S. life with reverence and conviction. Who eschew self-consciousness and hip fatigue. These anti-rebels would be outdated, of course, before they even started. Dead on the page. Too sincere. Clearly repressed. Backward, quaint, naive, anachronistic. Maybe that’ll be the point. Maybe that’s why they’ll be the next real rebels. Real rebels, as far as I can see, risk disapproval. The old postmodern insurgents risked the gasp and squeal: shock, disgust, outrage, censorship, accusations of socialism, anarchism, nihilism. Today’s risks are different. The new rebels might be artists willing to risk the yawn, the rolled eyes, the cool smile, the nudged ribs, the parody of gifted ironists, the “Oh how banal”. To risk accusations of sentimentality, melodrama. Of overcredulity. Of softness. Of willingness to be suckered by a world of lurkers and starers who fear gaze and ridicule above imprisonment without law. Who knows."&lt;/blockquote&gt;This was further examined on the blog ''Fiction Advocate by Mike Moats:''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fictionadvocate.com/2012/09/19/the-infinite-jest-liveblog-what-happened-pt-2/|title=The Infinite Jest Liveblog: What Happened, Pt. 2|last=Mike|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The theory is this: ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' is Wallace’s attempt to both manifest and dramatize a revolutionary fiction style that he called for in his essay “E Unibus Pluram: Television and U.S. Fiction.” The style is one in which a new sincerity will overturn the ironic detachment that hollowed out contemporary fiction towards the end of the 20th century. Wallace was trying to write an antidote to the cynicism that had pervaded and saddened so much of American culture in his lifetime.  He was trying to create an entertainment that would get us talking again."&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his 2010 essay "David Foster Wallace and the New Sincerity in American Fiction", Adam Kelly argues that Wallace's fiction, and that of his generation, is marked by a revival and theoretical reconception of sincerity, challenging the emphasis on authenticity that dominated twentieth-century literature and conceptions of the self.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Adam Kelly.

==In philosophy==
"New sincerity" has also sometimes been used to refer to a philosophical concept deriving from the basic tenets of [[performatism]].&lt;ref&gt;Raoul Eshelman, [http://www.anthropoetics.ucla.edu/ap0602/perform.htm "Performatism, or the End of Postmodernism"] in ''Anthropoetics'' 6 (2000/2001). See also his book, ''Performatism or the End of Postmodernism''. Davies Group: Aurora, Colorado 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also seen as one of the key characteristics of [[metamodernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Timotheus Vermeulen &amp; Robin van den Akker, [http://www.aestheticsandculture.net/index.php/jac/article/view/5677 "Notes on metamodernism"] in ''Journal of Aesthetics and Culture'' 2 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Related literature includes Wendy Steiner's ''The Trouble with Beauty'' and [[Elaine Scarry]]'s ''On Beauty and Being Just''. Related movements may include [[post-postmodernism]], [[New Puritans]], [[Stuckism]], the [[Kitsch movement]] and [[remodernism]], as well as the [[Dogme 95]] film movement led by [[Lars von Trier]] and others.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

==As a cultural movement==
"The New Sincerity" has been espoused since 2002 by radio host [[Jesse Thorn]] of [[Public Radio International|PRI]]'s ''[[The Sound of Young America]]'' (now ''Bullseye''), self-described as "the public radio program about things that are awesome". Thorn characterizes New Sincerity as a cultural movement defined by dicta including "Maximum Fun" and "Be More Awesome". It celebrates outsized celebration of joy, and rejects irony, and particularly ironic appreciation of cultural products. Thorn has promoted this concept on his program and in interviews&lt;ref&gt;Ben Kharakh, [http://gothamist.com/2006/11/02/jesse_thorn_ame.php "Jesse Thorn, America's Radio Sweetheart"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080929115220/http://gothamist.com/2006/11/02/jesse_thorn_ame.php |date=2008-09-29 }} in [[Gothamist]], posted November 2, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis McCafferty, [http://www.usaweekend.com/07_issues/070114/070114tech.html "Top podcast picks: Favorites from experts in their category"]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[USA Weekend]], January 14, 2007.

Solomon, ''What Is Soviet Now?: Identities, Legacies, Memories'' (LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2008), {{ISBN|978-3-8258-0640-8}}, p.258 n.3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3GonhERyzwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA258,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]]. ("In the United States, the term 'new sincerity' has been popularized since 9/11 by some youth media (for example, by Jesse Thorn, the host of a popular music program ''Sound of Young America'', on New York's National Public Radio station WNYC").)&lt;/ref&gt; A typical explication of Thorn's concept is this 2006 "Manifesto for the New Sincerity":&lt;blockquote&gt;
What is The New Sincerity? Think of it as irony and sincerity combined like [[Voltron]], to form a new movement of astonishing power. Or think of it as the absence of irony and sincerity, where less is (obviously) more. If those strain the brain, just think of [[Evel Knievel]]. Let's be frank. There's no way to appreciate Evel Knievel literally. Evel is the kind of man who defies even fiction, because the reality is too over the top. Here is a man in a red-white-and-blue leather jumpsuit, driving some kind of rocket car. A man who achieved fame and fortune jumping over things. Here is a real man who feels at home as [[Spider-Man|Spidey]] on the cover of a comic book. Simply put, Evel Knievel boggles the mind. But by the same token, he isn't to be taken ironically, either. The fact of the matter is that Evel is, in a word, awesome. . . . Our greeting: a double thumbs-up. Our credo: "Be More Awesome". Our lifestyle: "Maximum Fun". Throw caution to the wind, friend, and live The New Sincerity.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Thorn, [http://www.maximumfun.org/blog/2006/02/manifesto-for-new-sincerity.html "A Manifesto for The New Sincerity"], February 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a September 2009 interview, Thorn commented that "new sincerity" had begun as "a silly, philosophical movement that me and some friends made up in college" and that "everything that we said was a joke, but at the same time it wasn’t all a joke in the sense that we weren’t being arch or we weren’t being campy. While we were talking about ridiculous, funny things we were sincere about them."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Valania, [http://www.phawker.com/2009/09/15/qa-with-jesse-thorn-americas-radio-sweetheart/ "Q&amp;A: With Jesse Thorn, America’s Radio Sweetheart"], ''Phawker'', September 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thorn's concept of "new sincerity" as a social response has gained popularity since his introduction of the term in 2002. Several point to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] and the subsequent wake of events that created this movement, in which there was a drastic shift in tone. The 1990s were considered a period of artistic works ripe with irony, and the attacks shocked a change in the American culture. Graydon Carter, editor of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', published an editorial a few weeks after the attacks claiming that "this was the end of the age of irony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.salon.com/2001/09/25/irony_lives/ | title = Irony is dead! Long live irony! | first = David | last = Beers | date = September 25, 2001 | accessdate = April 20, 2016 | work = [[Salon (magazine)|Salon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan D. Fitzgerald for ''[[The Atlantic]]'' suggests this new movement could also be attributed to broader periodic shifts that occur in culture.&lt;ref name="atlantic 2012"/&gt;

As a result of this movement, several cultural works, including many identified above, were considered elements of "new sincerity",&lt;ref name="atlantic 2012"/&gt; but this was also seen to be a mannerism adopted by the general public, to show appreciation for cultural works that they happened to enjoy. Andrew Watercutter of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' saw this as having being able to enjoy one's [[guilty pleasure]]s without having to feel guilty about enjoying it, and being able to share that appreciation with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2010/09/new-sincerity/ | title = Sincerely Ours: Glee‘s Success Cements Age of Geeky ‘New Sincerity’ | first = Angela | last = Watercutter | date = September 21, 2010 | accessdate = April 20, 2016 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example of a "new sincerity" movement is the [[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fandom|brony fandom]], generally adult and primarily male fans of the 2010 animated show ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'' which is produced by [[Hasbro]] to sell its toys to young girls. These fans have been called "internet neo-sincerity at its best", unabashedly enjoying the show and challenging the preconceived gender roles that such a show ordinarily carries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | title = Curious about Bronies? | url = http://www.cbc.ca/q/blog/2011/12/07/curious-about-bronies/ | format = [[Adobe Flash]] | date = 2011-12-07 | accessdate = 2011-12-07 | publisher = [[CBC Radio]] | medium = Radio broadcast | first = Jian | last = Ghomeshi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired brony"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/underwire/2011/06/bronies-my-little-ponys/ | title = My Little Pony Corrals Unlikely Fanboys Known as 'Bronies' | first= Angela| last = Watchcutter | date = 2011-06-09 | accessdate = 2011-06-09 | work = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional variants==

===Russia===
In Russia, the term ''new sincerity'' (''novaya iskrennost'') was used as early as the mid-1980s&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Epstein]], "On the Place of Postmodernism in Postmodernity", in Mikhail Epstein, Aleksandr Genis, Slobodanka Vladiv-Glover, eds., ''Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture'' (Berghahn Books, 1999), {{ISBN|978-1-57181-098-4}}, p. 457, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5qjzj3JwaoIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA457,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; or early 1990s by dissident poet [[Dmitry Prigov]] and critic [[Mikhail Epstein]], as a response to the dominant sense of absurdity in late [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[post-Soviet]] culture.&lt;ref name="Yurchak n0"&gt;Alexei Yurchak, "Post-Post-Communist Sincerity: Pioneers, Cosmonauts, and Other Soviet Heroes Born Today", in Thomas Lahusen and Peter H. Solomon, eds., ''What Is Soviet Now?: Identities, Legacies, Memories'' (LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2008), {{ISBN|978-3-8258-0640-8}}, p. 258–259, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3GonhERyzwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA258,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Epstein's words, "Postconceptualism, or the New Sincerity, is an experiment in resuscitating "fallen", dead languages with a renewed pathos of love, sentimentality and enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Epstein]], "A Catalogue of New Poetries", in Mikhail Epstein, Aleksandr Genis, Slobodanka Vladiv-Glover, eds., ''Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture'' (Berghahn Books, 1999), {{ISBN|978-1-57181-098-4}}, p. 146 [https://books.google.com/books?id=5qjzj3JwaoIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA146,M1 excerpt] available at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;

This conception of "new sincerity" meant the avoidance of cynicism, but not necessarily of irony. In the words of Professor [[Alexei Yurchak]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]],&lt;ref name="Yurchak n1"&gt;[http://anthropology.berkeley.edu/users/alexei-yurchak Alexei Yurchak biography] at [[University of California, Berkeley]] Department of Anthropology website (retrieved February 15, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; it "is a particular brand of irony, which is sympathetic and warm, and allows its authors to remain committed to the ideals that they discuss, while also being somewhat ironic about this commitment".&lt;ref name="Yurchak n1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yurchak, at p.259 n.6, further explains this contrast in terms of [[Susan Sontag]]'s comment that a good writer should "Be serious. By which I meant: never be cynical. And which doesn't preclude being funny." (Citing Sontag as quoted in Jenny Diski, "Seriously Uncool", ''[[London Review of Books]]'' 29, no. 6 (March 22, 2007).)&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays New Sincerity is being contraposed not to Soviet literature, but to [[postmodernism]]. [[Dmitry Vodennikov]] has been acclaimed as the leader of the new wave of Russian New Sincerity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://magazines.russ.ru/novyi_mi/2006/8/vo9.html |title=Журнальный зал.

===In American poetry===
Since 2005, poets including Reb Livingston, Joseph Massey, Andrew Mister, and Anthony Robinson have collaborated in a [[blog]]-driven poetry movement, described by Massey as "a ‘new sincerity’ brewing in American poetry—a contrast to the cold, irony-laden poetry dominating the journals and magazines and new books of poetry".&lt;ref&gt;Katy Henriksen, [http://www.econoculture.com/m/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=414&amp;Itemid=45 " Drunk Bunnies, The New Sincerity, Flarf: How Blogs are Transforming Poetry"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110223025/http://econoculture.com/m/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=414&amp;Itemid=45 |date=2007-11-10 }}, ''EconoCulture'', January 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other poets named as associated with this movement, or its tenets, have included [[David Berman (musician)|David Berman]], [[Catherine Wagner]], [[Dean Young (poet)|Dean Young]], [[Matt Hart (poet)|Matt Hart]], [[Miranda July]],&lt;ref name="htmlgiant"&gt;http://htmlgiant.com/haut-or-not/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-the-new-sincerity/ Jameson, A.D.

{{Philosophy of religion sidebar |God}}

'''Pascal's Wager''' is an argument in philosophy presented by the seventeenth-century [[French people|French]] [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]] and [[physicist]] [[Blaise Pascal]] (1623–1662).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Connor |first= James A. |date= 2006 |title= Pascal's wager : the man who played dice with God |location= San Francisco |publisher= HarperSanFrancisco |pages= 180–1 |isbn= 9780060766917 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It posits that humans bet with their lives that God either [[Existence of God|exists]] or does not.

Pascal argues that a rational person should live as though God exists and seek to believe in God. If God does not actually exist, such a person will have only a finite loss (some pleasures, luxury, etc.), whereas he stands to receive infinite gains (as represented by eternity in [[Heaven]]) and avoid infinite losses (eternity in [[Hell]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Blaise Pascal", ''Columbia History of Western Philosophy'', page 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pascal's Wager was based on the idea of the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]], though similar arguments have occurred [[#Variations|in other religious traditions]]. The original wager was set out in section 233 of Pascal's posthumously published ''[[Pensées]]'' ("Thoughts"). These previously unpublished notes were assembled to form an incomplete [[treatise]] on [[Christian apologetics]].

Historically, Pascal's Wager was groundbreaking because it charted new territory in [[probability theory]],&lt;ref name="chance and infinity"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thegemsbok.com/art-reviews-and-articles/friday-phil-pascals-wager/|title=A Logical Infinite: The Constrained Probabilistic Definitions of Chance and Infinity in Blaise Pascal's Famous Wager|last=Podgorski|first=Daniel|date=December 18, 2015|website=The Gemsbok|access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; marked the first formal use of [[decision theory]], and anticipated future philosophies such as [[existentialism]], [[pragmatism]] and [[Voluntarism (metaphysics)|voluntarism]].&lt;ref name="SEP entry"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/index.html|title=Pascal's Wager|last=Hájek|first=Alan|date=November 6, 2012|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Wager==
{{refimprove|date=April 2017}}
The Wager uses the following logic (excerpts from ''Pensées'', part III, §233):

#God is, or God is not. Reason cannot decide between the two alternatives.
#A Game is being played... where heads or tails will turn up.
#You must wager (it is not optional).
#Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing.
#Wager, then, without hesitation that He is. (...) There is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain against a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is finite. And so our proposition is of infinite force, when there is the finite to stake in a game where there are equal risks of gain and of loss, and the infinite to gain.
#But some cannot believe. They should then 'at least learn your inability to believe...' and 'Endeavour then to convince' themselves.

Pascal asks the reader to analyze humankind's position, where our actions can be enormously consequential but our understanding of those consequences is flawed. While we can discern a great deal through reason, we are ultimately forced to gamble. Pascal cites a number of distinct areas of uncertainty in human life:

|}
Pascal describes humanity as a finite being trapped within an incomprehensible infinity, briefly thrust into being from non-being, with no explanation of "Why?" or "What?" or "How?" On Pascal's view, human finitude constrains our ability to reliably achieve truth.

Given that reason alone cannot determine whether God exists, Pascal concludes that this question functions like a coin toss. However, even if we do not know the outcome of this coin toss, we must base our actions on some expectation about the outcome. We must decide whether to live as though God exists, or whether to live as though God does not exist, even though we may be mistaken in either case.

In Pascal's assessment, participation in this wager is not optional. Merely by existing in a state of uncertainty, we are forced to choose between the available courses of action for practical purposes.

==Explanation==
The ''Pensées'' passage on Pascal's Wager is as follows:

{{quote|If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible, since, having neither parts nor limits, He has no affinity to us. We are then incapable of knowing either what He is or if He is....

..."God is, or He is not." But to which side shall we incline? Reason can decide nothing here. There is an infinite chaos which separated us. A game is being played at the extremity of this infinite distance where heads or tails will turn up. What will you wager? According to reason, you can do neither the one thing nor the other; according to reason, you can defend neither of the propositions.

Do not, then, reprove for error those who have made a choice; for you know nothing about it. "No, but I blame them for having made, not this choice, but a choice; for again both he who chooses heads and he who chooses tails are equally at fault, they are both in the wrong. The true course is not to wager at all."

Yes; but you must wager. It is not optional. You are embarked. Which will you choose then? Let us see. Since you must choose, let us see which interests you least. You have two things to lose, the true and the good; and two things to stake, your reason and your will, your knowledge and your happiness; and your nature has two things to shun, error and misery. Your reason is no more shocked in choosing one rather than the other, since you must of necessity choose. This is one point settled. But your happiness? Let us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing. Wager, then, without hesitation that He is.

"That is very fine. Yes, I must wager; but I may perhaps wager too much." Let us see. Since there is an equal risk of gain and of loss, if you had only to gain two lives, instead of one, you might still wager. But if there were three lives to gain, you would have to play (since you are under the necessity of playing), and you would be imprudent, when you are forced to play, not to chance your life to gain three at a game where there is an equal risk of loss and gain. But there is an eternity of life and happiness. And this being so, if there were an infinity of chances, of which one only would be for you, you would still be right in wagering one to win two, and you would act stupidly, being obliged to play, by refusing to stake one life against three at a game in which out of an infinity of chances there is one for you, if there were an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain. But there is here an infinity of an infinitely happy life to gain, a chance of gain against a finite number of chances of loss, and what you stake is finite.&lt;ref name="renamed_from_272_on_20110506051909"/&gt;}}

Pascal begins by painting a situation where both the existence and non-existence of God are impossible to prove by [[Reason|human reason]]. So, supposing that reason cannot determine the truth between the two options, one must "wager" by weighing the possible consequences. Pascal's assumption is that, when it comes to making the decision, no one can refuse to participate; withholding assent is impossible because we are already "embarked", effectively living out the choice.

We only have two things to stake, our "reason" and our "happiness". Pascal considers that if there is "''equal'' risk of loss and gain" (i.e. a coin toss), then human reason is powerless to address the question of whether God exists. That being the case, then human reason can only decide the question according to possible resulting happiness of the decision, weighing the gain and loss in believing that God exists and likewise in believing that God does not exist.

He points out that if a wager was between the equal chance of gaining two lifetimes of happiness and gaining nothing, then a person would be a fool to bet on the latter. The same would go if it was three lifetimes of happiness versus nothing. He then argues that it is simply unconscionable by comparison to bet against an eternal life of happiness for the possibility of gaining nothing. The wise decision is to wager that God exists, since "If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing", meaning one can gain [[Immortality|eternal life]] if God exists, but if not, one will be no worse off in death than if one had not believed. On the other hand, if you bet against God, win or lose, you either gain nothing or lose everything. You are either unavoidably annihilated (in which case, nothing matters one way or the other) or lose the opportunity of eternal happiness. In note 194, speaking about those who live apathetically betting against God, he sums up by remarking, "It is to the glory of religion to have for enemies men so unreasonable..."

===Inability to believe===
Pascal addressed the difficulty that '[[reason]]' and '[[rationality]]' pose to genuine belief by proposing that "acting as if [one] believed" could "cure [one] of unbelief":

{{quote|quote=But at least learn your inability to believe, since reason brings you to this, and yet you cannot believe. Endeavour then to convince yourself, not by increase of proofs of God, but by the abatement of your passions. You would like to attain faith, and do not know the way; you would like to cure yourself of unbelief, and ask the remedy for it. Learn of those who have been bound like you, and who now stake all their possessions. These are people who know the way which you would follow, and who are cured of an ill of which you would be cured. Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you believe, and deaden your acuteness.&lt;ref&gt;Pensées Section III note 233, Translation by W. F. Trotter&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Analysis with decision theory===
The possibilities defined by Pascal's Wager can be thought of as a [[decision theory#Choice under uncertainty|decision under uncertainty]] with the values of the following [[decision matrix]].
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;width100%;"
|-
|
! God exists (G)
! God does not exist (¬G)
|-
! Belief (B)
| +∞ (infinite gain)
| −1 (finite loss)
|-
! Disbelief (¬B)
| −∞ (infinite loss)
| +1 (finite gain)
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Given these values, the option of living as if God exists (B) dominates the option of living as if God does not exist (¬B), as long as one assumes a positive probability that God exists. In other words, the expected value gained by choosing B is greater than or equal to that of choosing ¬B.

In fact, according to decision theory, the only value that matters in the above matrix is the +∞ (infinitely positive).  Any matrix of the following type (where f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and f&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are all negative or finite positive numbers) results in (B) as being the only rational decision.&lt;ref name="SEP entry" /&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
|-
|
! God exists (G)
! God does not exist (¬G)
|-
! Belief (B)
| +∞
| f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
! Disbelief (¬B)
| f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
| f&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

===Misunderstanding of the wager===
Many criticisms have explained that the wager has been used as a supposed theory of the necessity to believe, although that was never Pascal's intention. As Laurent Thirouin writes: 
{{quote|The celebrity of fragment 418 has been established at the price of a mutilation. By titling this text "the wager", readers have been fixated only on one part of Pascal's reasoning. It doesn't conclude with a QED at the end of the mathematical part. The unbeliever who had provoked this long analysis to counter his previous objection ("Maybe I bet too much") is still not ready to join the apologist on the side of faith. He put forward two new objections, undermining the foundations of the wager: the impossibility to know, and the obligation of playing.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Thiroin, Le hasard et les règles, le modèle du jeu dans la pensée de Pascal, Vrin, Paris 1991, p.170&lt;/ref&gt;}}
To be put at the beginning of Pascal's planned book, the wager was meant to show that logical reasoning cannot support faith or lack thereof, {{quote|We have to accept reality and accept the reaction of the libertine when he rejects arguments he is unable to counter. The conclusion is evident: if men believe or refuse to believe, it is not how some believers sometimes say and most unbelievers claim, because their own reason justifies the position they have adopted. Belief in God doesn't depend upon rational evidence, no matter which position.&lt;ref&gt;Laurent Thiroin, Le hasard et les règles, le modèle du jeu dans la pensée de Pascal, Vrin, Paris 1991, p.176&lt;/ref&gt;}}Pascal's intended book was precisely to find other ways to establish the value of faith, an apology for the Christian faith.

==Criticism==
Criticism of Pascal's Wager began in his own day, and came from both atheists, who questioned the 'benefits' of a deity whose 'realm' is beyond reason, and the religiously orthodox, who primarily took issue with the wager's [[deism|deistic]] and [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] language. It is criticized for not proving God's existence, the encouragement of false belief, and the problem of which religion and which God should be worshipped.&lt;ref name="chance and infinity" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The God Delusion"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Dawkins|publisher=Black Swan|date=May 21, 2007|title=[[The God Delusion]]|pages=130–132|chapter=Chapter 3: Arguments for God's existence|isbn=9780552773317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Should probably source criticisms to J. H. Sobel, Logic and Theism, Chapter XIII --&gt;

===Nature as not a proof of the existence of God=== 
[[Voltaire]] (another prominent French writer of the [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), a generation after Pascal, rejected the idea that the wager was "proof of God" as "indecent and childish", adding, "the interest I have to believe a thing is no proof that such a thing exists".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.voltaire-integral.com/Html/22/07_Pascal.html|title=Remarques (Premiéres) sur les Pensées de Pascal|last=Voltaire|authorlink=Voltaire|year=1728|website=Oeuvres Complétes de Voltaire|series=Mélanges I|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418162422/http://www.voltaire-integral.com/Html/22/07_Pascal.html|archive-date=April 18, 2012|dead-url=yes|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal, however, did not advance the wager as a proof of God's existence but rather as a necessary pragmatic decision which is "impossible to avoid" for any living person.&lt;ref name="Durant-Voltaire"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Durant
  | first = Will and Ariel
  | authorlink= Will Durant
  | title = The Age of Voltaire
  | year = 1965
  | pages = 370
}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that abstaining from making a wager is not an option and that "reason is incapable of divining the truth"; thus, a decision of whether to believe in the existence of God must be made by "considering the consequences of each possibility".

Voltaire's critique concerns not the nature of the Pascalian wager as proof of God's existence, but the contention that the very belief Pascal tried to promote is not convincing. Voltaire hints at the fact that Pascal, as a [[Jansenist]], believed that only a small, and already predestined, portion of humanity would eventually be saved by God.

Voltaire explained that no matter how far someone is tempted with rewards to believe in Christian salvation, the result will be at best a faint belief.&lt;ref&gt;Vous me promettez l’empire du monde si je crois que vous avez raison: je souhaite alors, de tout mon coeur, que vous ayez raison; mais jusqu’à ce que vous me l’ayez prouvé, je ne puis vous croire. […] J’ai intérêt, sans doute, qu’il y ait un Dieu; mais si dans votre système Dieu n’est venu que pour si peu de personnes; si le petit nombre des élus est si effrayant; si je ne puis rien du tout par moi-même, dites-moi, je vous prie, quel intérêt j’ai à vous croire? N’ai-je pas un intérêt visible à être persuadé du contraire? De quel front osez-vous me montrer un bonheur infini, auquel d’un million d’hommes un seul à peine a droit d’aspirer?&lt;/ref&gt;  Pascal, in his Pensees, agrees with this, not stating that people can choose to believe (and therefore make a safe wager), but rather that some cannot believe.

As [[Étienne Souriau]] explained, in order to accept Pascal's argument, the bettor needs to be certain that God seriously intends to honour the bet; he says that the Wager assumes that God also accepts the bet, which is not proved; Pascal's bettor is here like the fool who seeing a leaf floating on a river's waters and quivering at some point, for a few seconds, between the two sides of a stone, says: "I bet a million with Rothschild that it takes finally the left path." And, effectively, the leaf passed on the left side of the stone, but unfortunately for the fool Rothschild never said "I [will take that] bet".&lt;ref&gt;À vrai dire le célèbre pari de Pascal, ou plutôt le pari que Pascal propose au libertin n'est pas une option désintéressée mais un pari de joueur. Si le libertin joue «croix», parie que Dieu existe, il gagne (si Dieu existe) la vie éternelle et la béatitude infinie, et risque seulement de perdre les misérables plaisirs de sa vie actuelle. Cette mise ne compte pas au regard du gain possible qui est infini. Seulement, l'argument suppose que Dieu accepte le pari, que Dieu dit «je tiens». Sans quoi, nous dit Souriau, le libertin « est comme ce fou : il voit une feuille au fil de l'eau, hésiter entre deux côtés d'un caillou. Il dit : «je parie un million avec Rothschild qu'elle passera à droite». La feuille passe à droite et le fou dit : «j'ai gagné un million». Où est sa folie? Ce n'est pas que le million n'existe pas, c'est que Rothschild n'a pas dit : «je tiens». ». (Cf. l'admirable analyse du pari de Pascal in Souriau, L'ombre de Dieu, p. 47 sq.) – La Philosophie, Tome 2 (La Connaissance), Denis Huisman, André Vergez, Marabout 1994, pp. 462–63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argument from inconsistent revelations===
{{main|Argument from inconsistent revelations}}
Since there have been many religions throughout history, and therefore many conceptions of God (or gods), some assert that all of them need to be factored into the Wager, in an argument known as the [[argument from inconsistent revelations]]. This, its proponents argue, would lead to a high probability of believing in "the wrong god", which, they claim, eliminates the mathematical advantage Pascal claimed with his Wager.&lt;ref name="chance and infinity" /&gt; [[Denis Diderot]], a contemporary of Voltaire, concisely expressed this opinion when asked about the Wager, saying "an [[Imam]] could reason the same way".&lt;ref name="Diderot"&gt;{{cite book

  | first = Denis
  | authorlink = Denis Diderot
  | editor = J. Assézar

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. L. Mackie]] notes that "the church within which alone salvation is to be found is not necessarily the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church of Rome]], but perhaps that of the [[Anabaptists]] or members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] or the [[Sunni Muslims|Muslim Sunnis]] or the worshipers of [[Kali]] or of [[Odin]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[J.L. Mackie|Mackie, J. L.]] (1982). ''The Miracle of Theism'', Oxford, pg. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

Another version of this objection argues that for every religion that promulgates rules, there exists another religion that has rules of the opposite kind. If a certain action leads one closer to salvation in the former religion, it leads one further away from it in the latter. Therefore, the expected value of following a certain religion could be negative. Or, one could also argue that there are an infinite number of mutually exclusive religions (which is a subset of the set of all possible religions), and that the probability of any one of them being true is zero; therefore, the expected value of following a certain religion is zero.

Pascal considers this type of objection briefly in the notes compiled into the ''Pensées'', and dismisses it as obviously wrong and disingenuous:&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, David (1994). ''Pascal and Disbelief: Catechesis and Conversion in the Pensées''. Washington, D. C.: The Catholic University of America Press, p. 117. {{ISBN|0-8132-1328-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=What say [the unbelievers] then? "Do we not see," say they, "that the brutes live and die like men, and Turks like Christians? They have their ceremonies, their prophets, their doctors, their saints, their monks, like us," etc. If you care but little to know the truth, that is enough to leave you in repose. But if you desire with all your heart to know it, it is not enough; look at it in detail. That would be sufficient for a question in philosophy; but not here, where everything is at stake. And yet, after a superficial reflection of this kind, we go to amuse ourselves, etc. Let us inquire of this same religion whether it does not give a reason for this obscurity; perhaps it will teach it to us.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;}}

This short but densely packed passage, which alludes to numerous themes discussed elsewhere in the ''Pensées'', has given rise to many pages of scholarly analysis.

Pascal says that unbelievers who rest content with the many-religions objection are people whose scepticism has seduced them into a fatal "repose". If they were really bent on knowing the truth, they would be persuaded to examine "in detail" whether Christianity is like any other religion, but they just cannot be bothered.&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt; Their objection might be sufficient were the subject concerned merely some "question in philosophy", but not "here, where everything is at stake". In "a matter where they themselves, their eternity, their all are concerned",&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm#p_226 ''Pensée'' #226]&lt;/ref&gt; they can manage no better than "a superficial reflection" ("une reflexion légère") and, thinking they have scored a point by asking a [[leading question]], they go off to amuse themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Pascal scholars observe, Pascal regarded the many-religions objection as a rhetorical ploy, a "trap"&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', pp. 118 (quotation from Jean Mesnard), 236.&lt;/ref&gt; that he had no intention of falling into. If, however, any who raised it were sincere, they would want to examine the matter "in detail". In that case, they could get some pointers by turning to his chapter on "other religions".

As David Wetsel notes, Pascal's treatment of the pagan religions is brisk: "As far as Pascal is concerned, the demise of the pagan religions of antiquity speaks for itself. Those pagan religions which still exist in the New World, in India, and in Africa are not even worth a second glance. They are obviously the work of superstition and ignorance and have nothing in them which might interest 'les gens habiles' ('clever men')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm#p_251 ''Pensée'' #251]&lt;/ref&gt;".&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Islam warrants more attention, being distinguished from paganism (which for Pascal presumably includes all the other non-Christian religions) by its claim to be a revealed religion. Nevertheless, Pascal concludes that the religion founded by Mohammed can on several counts be shown to be devoid of divine authority, and that therefore, as a path to the knowledge of God, it is as much a dead end as paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism, in view of its close links to Christianity, he deals with elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Wetsel, ''Pascal and Disbelief'', p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

The many-religions objection is taken more seriously by some later [[apologist]]s of the Wager, who argue that, of the rival options, only those awarding infinite happiness affect the Wager's [[dominance (game theory)|dominance]]. In the opinion of these apologists "finite, semi-blissful promises such as Kali's or Odin's" therefore drop out of consideration.&lt;ref name="SEP entry" /&gt;  Also, the infinite bliss that the rival conception of God offers has to be mutually exclusive.  If Christ's promise of bliss can be attained concurrently with [[Jehovah]]'s and [[Allah]]'s (all three being identified as the [[Abrahamic religions|God of Abraham]]), there is no conflict in the decision matrix in the case where the cost of believing in the wrong conception of God is neutral (limbo/purgatory/spiritual death), although this would be countered with an infinite cost in the case where not believing in the correct conception of God results in punishment (hell).&lt;ref name="IEP entry"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/pasc-wag/|title=Pascal's Wager about God|last=Saka|first=Paul|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, [[ecumenical]] interpretations of the Wager&lt;ref&gt;For example: Jeff Jordan, ''Gambling on God: Essays on Pascal's Wager'', 1994, Rowman &amp; Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that it could even be suggested that believing in a generic God, or a god by the wrong name, is acceptable so long as that conception of God has similar essential characteristics of the conception of God considered in Pascal's Wager (perhaps the [[Aristotelian view of God|God of Aristotle]]).  Proponents of this line of reasoning suggest that either all of the conceptions of God or gods throughout history truly boil down to just a small set of "genuine options", or that if Pascal's Wager can simply bring a person to believe in "generic theism" it has done its job.&lt;ref name="IEP entry" /&gt;

Pascal argues implicitly for the uniqueness of Christianity in the Wager itself, writing: "If there is a God, He is infinitely incomprehensible...Who then can blame the Christians for not being able to give reasons for their beliefs, professing as they do a religion which they cannot explain by reason?"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stat.ucla.edu/history/pascal_wager.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argument from inauthentic belief===
Some critics argue that Pascal's Wager, for those who cannot believe, suggests feigning belief to gain eternal reward. This would be dishonest and immoral. In addition, it is absurd to think that God, being just and omniscient, would not see through this deceptive strategy on the part of the "believer", thus nullifying the benefits of the Wager.&lt;ref name="The God Delusion" /&gt;

Since these criticisms are concerned not with the validity of the Wager itself, but with its possible aftermath—namely that a person who has been convinced of the overwhelming odds in favor of belief might still find himself unable to sincerely believe—they are tangential to the thrust of the Wager. What such critics are objecting to is Pascal's subsequent advice to an unbeliever who, having concluded that the only rational way to wager is in favor of God's existence, points out, reasonably enough, that this by no means makes him a believer. This hypothetical unbeliever complains, "I am so made that I cannot believe. What would you have me do?"&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm#p_233 ''Pensée'' #233]&lt;/ref&gt; Pascal, far from suggesting that God can be deceived by outward show, says that God does not regard it at all: "God looks only at what is inward."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-h/18269-h.htm#p_904 ''Pensée'' #904]&lt;/ref&gt; For a person who is already convinced of the odds of the Wager but cannot seem to put his heart into the belief, he offers practical advice.

Explicitly addressing the question of inability to believe, Pascal argues that if the Wager is valid, the inability to believe is irrational, and therefore must be caused by feelings: "your inability to believe, because reason compels you to [believe] and yet you cannot, [comes] from your passions." This inability, therefore, can be overcome by diminishing these irrational sentiments: "Learn from those who were bound like you. . . . Follow the way by which they began; by acting as if they believed, taking the holy water, having masses said, etc. Even this will naturally make you believe, and deaden your acuteness.—'But this is what I am afraid of.'—And why? What have you to lose?"&lt;ref&gt;''Pensée'' #233. Gérard Ferreyrolles, ed. Paris: Librairie Générale Française, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other critics have objected to Pascal's Wager on the grounds that he wrongly assumes what type of epistemic character God would likely value in his rational creatures if he existed. More specifically, [[Richard Carrier]] has objected by positing an alternative conception of God that prefers his creatures to be honest inquirers and disapproves of thoughtless or feigned belief:

{{quote box|quote=Suppose there is a god who is watching us and choosing which souls of the deceased to bring to heaven, and this god really does want only the morally good to populate heaven. He will probably select from only those who made a significant and responsible effort to discover the truth. . .Therefore, only such people can be sufficiently moral and trustworthy to deserve a place in heaven — unless God wishes to fill heaven with the morally lazy, irresponsible, or untrustworthy.

==Variations==
*Muslim [[Imamah (Shia)|Imam]] [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] is recorded to have postulated variations of the Wager on several occasions in different forms, including his famed 'Tradition of the Myrobalan Fruit.'&lt;ref&gt; Al-Islam.org. (2017). Tradition of the Myrobalan Fruit. https://www.al-islam.org/tradition-myrobalan-fruit-hadith-al-halila-imam-jafar-al-sadiq/hadith&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Shia Islam|Sh'i'i]] [[hadith]] book [[Al-Kafi|al-Kafi]], al-Sadiq declares to an atheist "If what you say is correct – and it is not – then we will both succeed. But if what I say is correct – and it is – then I will succeed, and you will be destroyed."&lt;ref&gt;al-Kulainī, M. (1982). al- Kāfī. Tehran: Group of Muslim Brothers.&lt;/ref&gt;
*An instantiation of this [[argument]], within the Islamic ''kalam'' tradition, was discussed by [[Al-Juwayni|Imam al-Haramayn al-Juwayni]] (d. 478/1085) in his ''Kitab al-irshad ila-qawati al-adilla fi usul al-i'tiqad'', or ''A Guide to the Conclusive Proofs for the Principles of Belief''.&lt;ref&gt;[[al-Juwayni]] ''A Guide to Conclusive Proofs for the Principles of Belief'', 6&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Anyone want to write a little about what makes Juwayni's argument different from Pascal's? --&gt;
*The [[Sophist]] [[Protagoras]] had an agnostic position regarding the gods, but he nevertheless continued to worship the gods. This could be considered as an early version of the Wager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Socrates &amp; the fat rabbis|last= Boyarin|first=Daniel|authorlink=Daniel Boyarin|year=2009 |publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0-226-06916-8|page=48 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the famous tragedy of [[Euripides]] ''[[The Bacchae|Bacchae]]'', [[Kadmos]] states an early version of Pascal's Wager. It is noteworthy that at the end of the tragedy [[Dionysos]], the god to whom [[Kadmos]] referred, appears and punishes him for thinking in this way. [[Euripides]], quite clearly, considered and dismissed the wager in this tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Plots of epiphany: prison-escape in Acts of the Apostles |last= Weaver|first=John B.|authorlink= John B. Weaver|year=2004 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-018266-8|pages=453–454, 595}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Christian apologist [[Arnobius of Sicca]] (d. 330) stated an early version of the argument in his book ''Against the Pagans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The pillar and ground of the truth (1914)|last= Aleksandrovich Florenskiĭ|first=Pavel|authorlink=Pavel Florensky|year=1997 |publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-03243-2 |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pascal's Wager is often concluded (not by Pascal) by stating that people should 'choose the safer wager'.  Pascal stated that people could not simply choose to believe, but that they might develop a faith through their actions.
*In the [[Sanskrit]] classic ''[[Sārasamuccaya]]'', &lt;!-- WAIT--WAIT! Before you remove the brackets, consider writing a new article! -- Paine --&gt;[[Vararuci]] makes a similar argument to Pascal's Wager.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Ostler|Ostler, Nicholas]] (2005). ''Empires of the Word''. HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 2008 philosophy book, ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time]]'', presents a secular revision of Pascal’s wager: “What does it hurt to pursue value and virtue? If there is value, then we have everything to gain, but if there is none, then we haven’t lost anything.... Thus, we should seek value.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://andphilosophy.com/2014/07/16/24-and-philosophy/ 24 and Philosophy (2014)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16278">"'''Peace through strength'''" is a [[phrase]] which suggests that [[military]] [[Power (social and political)|power]] can help preserve [[peace]]. It is quite old and has famously been used by many leaders from [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]] in the [[1st century|first century AD]] to former [[United States|U.S.]] [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] in the 1980s. The concept has long been associated with [[realpolitik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjIrN4WGJUwC&amp;pg=PA325 |page=325 |title=World Politics: The Menu for Choice |author=Bruce Russett |date=2009 |publisher=Cengage Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has critics: "'Peace through strength' easily enough becomes 'peace through war,'" according to [[Andrew Bacevich]].

==History==
The phrase and concept date to ancient times. [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]] (AD 76–138) is said to have sought "peace through strength or, failing that, peace through threat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gVXFkh-tlBcC |title=Following Hadrian? |author=Elizabeth Speller |publisher=Oxford University Press |date= Oct 14, 2004 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hadrian's Wall]] was a symbol of this policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2010/mar/14/hadrians-wall-lights-illumination |title=Legions of sightseers attend Hadrian's Wall illumination |author=Martin Wainwright |quote=Designed as a symbol of Hadrian's contemporary-sounding policy of "peace through strength", the wall marked the northern frontier of the Roman empire. |date=14 March 2010 |accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===
The first American President, [[George Washington]], enunciated a policy of peace through strength in his fifth annual message to Congress, the [[1793 State of the Union Address]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5qvfCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24 |title=Invitation to Peace Studies |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Houston Wood |year=2015 |pages=24–25 |accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1FPpEd0sBJQC&amp;pg=PA24 |title=George Washington and the Origins of the American Presidency |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |author=Mark J Rozell |year=2000 |page=24 |accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said:

:"There is a rank due to the United States among nations which will be withheld, if not absolutely lost, by the reputation of weakness. If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known that we are at all times ready for war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/washs05.asp |title=Fifth Annual Message of George Washington |work=[[1793 State of the Union Address]] |location=Philadelphia |author=[[George Washington]] |date=December 3, 1793 |accessdate=April 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Federalist No. 24]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] argued for peace through strength, stating that strong garrisons in the west and a navy in the east would protect the Union from the threat of Britain and Spain.&lt;ref name=Book5&gt;{{cite book|title=The Federalist Papers|year=1999|publisher=New American Library, a division of Penguin Books|location=New York|isbn=0-451-52881-6|pages=157–158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Peace Through Strength'' (1952) is the title of a book about a defense plan by [[Bernard Baruch]], a [[World War II]] adviser to [[U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], published by [[Farrar, Straus and Young]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Peace_through_strength.html?id=5icdAAAAMAAJ|title=Peace through strength: Bernard Baruch and a blueprint for security|first=Morris Victor|last=Rosenbloom|date=1 January 1952|publisher=American Surveys in association with Farrar, Straus and Young, New York|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1964 presidential campaign in the United States, the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] spent about $5 million on "Peace through Strength" TV spots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iREHODXtO-wC&amp;pg=PA76 |page=76 |title=Posters, Propaganda, and Persuasion in Election Campaigns Around the World and Through History |author=Steven A. Seidman |publisher=Peter Lang |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For supporters of the [[MX missile]] in the 1970s, the missile symbolized "peace through strength".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Perspective: Cold War Relic; All It Touched Off Was a Debate  |author=Fred Kaplan | authorlink=Fred Kaplan (journalist) |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=18 September 2005 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE6D81F31F93BA2575AC0A9639C8B63&amp;scp=9&amp;sq=peace%20through%20strength&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The US Republican party====

In 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] used the phrase during his election challenge against [[Jimmy Carter]], accusing the incumbent of weak, vacillating leadership that invited enemies to attack the United States and its allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Politics Starts at the Water’s Edge  |authors=[[Kiron K. Skinner]], Serhiy Kudelia, Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, and Condoleezza Rice |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=17 September 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/opinion/15skinner.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z0VQ4vFwPU |title=Peace Through Strength (1980 Political Commercial) |author= |date= |work= |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reagan later considered it one of the mainstays of his foreign policy as [[President of the United States|President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/about/presidents/ronaldreagan |title=Biography of Ronald Reagan |author=[[White House]] |date= |work= |publisher=[[United States Government]] |accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, he explained it thus:

:"We know that peace is the condition under which mankind was meant to flourish. Yet peace does not exist of its own will. It depends on us, on our courage to build it and guard it and pass it on to future generations. George Washington's words may seem hard and cold today, but history has proven him right again and again. "To be prepared for war," he said, "is one of the most effective means of preserving peace." Well, to those who think strength provokes conflict, [[Will Rogers]] had his own answer. He said of the world heavyweight champion of his day: "I've never seen anyone insult [[Jack Dempsey]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reagan2020.us/speeches/address_on_national_security.asp|title=Reagan 2020 - Ronald Reagan - Address on National Security|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach has been credited for forcing the [[Soviet Union]] to lose the arms race and end the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gDQvz0Bck8sC&amp;pg=PA168 |title=Historical Dictionary Of Arms Control And Disarmament |author=Jeffrey Arthur Larsen |chapter=Peace through Strength |page=168 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Peace Through Strength" is the official motto of the ''Nimitz''-class nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, [[USS Ronald Reagan|USS ''Ronald Reagan'']] (CVN-76).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Peace Through Strength' - The Official Web Site of CVN 76 USS Ronald Reagan|url=http://www.public.navy.mil/airfor/cvn76/Pages/default.aspx|publisher=United States Navy|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Peace Through Strength" appeared in the Republican Party platforms of 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Republican Party Platform of 1980|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25844|publisher=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Republican Party Platform of 1984|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25845|publisher=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Republican Party Platform of 1988|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25846|publisher=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Republican Platform of 1992|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25849|publisher=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Republican Party Platform of 1996|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25849|publisher=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Republican Party Platform of 2000|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=25849|publisher=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Republican Party Platform|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=78545|publisher=The American Presidenty Project|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Republican Platform|title=We Believe in America|url=http://www.gop.com/2012-republican-platform_exceptionalism/|publisher=Republican National Committee|accessdate=October 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Huntley|first=Steve|title=Romney's Foreign Policy: Peace Through Strength|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/huntley/15634669-452/romneys-foreign-policy-promotes-peace-through-strength.html|accessdate=October 12, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Sun Times|date=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Editorial|title=Romney's Peace Through Strength|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/oct/8/romneys-peace-through-strength/|accessdate=October 12, 2012|newspaper=Washington Times|date=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Walshe|first=Shushannah|title=Paul Ryan Describes Mitt Romney Foreign Policy as the 'Peace Through Strength Doctrine'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/paul-ryan-says-mitt-romney-foreign-policy-is-peace-through-strength-doctrine/|newspaper=The Note, ABC News|date=September 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/ted-cruzs-hugely-expensive-plan-for-a-huge-military/462993/ |title=Ted Cruz's Hugely Expensive Plan for a Huge Military |work=[[The Atlantic]] |author=David A.

Barabak|date=December 6, 2016|work=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On assuming office in January 2017, [[President Trump]] cited the idea of "Peace Through Strength" as central to his overall "America First" foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trumps-national-security-adviser-says-foreign-policy-will-emphasize-peace-through-strength/2017/01/10/e4652c08-d767-11e6-b8b2-cb5164beba6b_story.html |title=Trump’s national security adviser says foreign policy will emphasize ‘peace through strength’ |work=[[Washington Post]] |author=Karen DeYoung |date=January 10, 2017 |accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

For [[Andrew Bacevich]], "belief in the efficacy of military power almost inevitably breeds the temptation to put that power to work. 'Peace through strength' easily enough becomes 'peace through war.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Western Way of War Has Run its Course |author=[[Andrew Bacevich]] |newspaper=[[CBS News]] |date=4 August 2010 |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/08/04/opinion/main6742001.shtml |accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim George of [[Australian National University]] used the term to describe part of what he argued was the [[Leo Strauss|Straussian]] and [[neoconservative]] foreign policy of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jim George |date=June 2005 |title=Leo Strauss, Neoconservatism and US Foreign Policy: Esoteric Nihilism and the Bush Doctrine |journal=International Politics |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=174&amp;ndash;202 |doi=10.1057/palgrave.ip.8800106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mock inversion "strength through peace" has been used on occasion to draw criticism to the militaristic system of diplomacy advocated by "peace through strength".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Polite Protesters: The American Peace Movement of the 1980s |pages=103–104 |author=John Lofland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YjCBPMJCz5EC&amp;pg=PA104 |year=1993 |publisher=Syracuse University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio Congressman [[Dennis Kucinich]] adopted the slogan "Strength Through Peace" during his 2008 Presidential run, as part of his platform as a peace candidate in opposition to the Iraq War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rzXqCEJPhLMC&amp;pg=PA29 |title=The Race for the 2008 Democratic Nomination: A Book of Editorial Cartoons |editor=Eric Appleman |publisher=Pelican Publishing |year=2008 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark dispute==
During Reagan's presidency, the non-profit [[American Security Council Foundation]] (ASCF) and its for-profit direct-mail provider, Communications Corporation of America, sought to influence United States foreign policy by promoting the idea, but after the Soviet collapse of 1991 ASCF fell into obscurity while other organizations continued to promote the slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americansecuritycouncil.org |title=The American Security Council Mission Statement |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Heritage Foundation]] and the [[Center for Security Policy]] (CSP) have also used the term in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kim R. Holmes |year=1995 |title=Geo-Conservatism; Why Conservatives Are Better Than Liberals at Foreign Policy |journal=[[Policy Review]] |publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]&lt;!-- at time of publication--&gt; |volume= |issue=71 |pages= |url=https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5001643939 |doi= |authorlink= Kim Holmes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ASCF registered a trademark for the phrase in April 2011.&lt;ref name=uspto&gt;{{cite web|title=Peace Through Strength|url=http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4008:gfrhmd.2.3|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|accessdate=15 September 2012|date=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, ASCF filed a trademark infringement lawsuit against CSP and [[Frank Gaffney]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Security Council Foundation v. Center for Security Policy, Inc. et al|url=http://dockets.justia.com/docket/district-of-columbia/dcdce/1:2012cv01486/155957/|work=District of Columbia District Court|publisher=Justia|date=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting the ''Washington City Paper'' to ridicule ASCF's Director of Operations, Gary James, for editing the online encyclopedia [[Wikipedia]] article titled 'Peace through strength' so that it was "drenched in ... ASCF references".&lt;ref name=sommer&gt;{{cite news|last=Sommer|first=Will|title=No Peace for Hawkish Think Tanks Over Reagan Slogan|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2012/09/14/no-peace-for-hawkish-think-tanks-over-reagan-slogan/|newspaper=Washington City Paper|date=September 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a counterclaim by the CSP alleging that the trademark application had been fraudulent, in August 2013 the ACSF announced that it had settled the lawsuit with the CSP and would cancel its trademark claim.&lt;ref name="settlement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanfreedomlawcenter.org/press-release/ronald-reagans-legacy-preserved-aflc-wins-favorable-settlement-in-trademark-battle-over-famous-slogan/|title=Ronald Reagan’s Legacy Preserved: AFLC Wins Favorable Settlement in Trademark Battle over Famous Slogan|date=August 5, 2013|author=[[American Security Council Foundation]]|accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Ludwig Berger''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜr|ɡ|ər}}; March 17, 1929 &amp;ndash; June 27, 2017) was an Austrian-born American [[sociology|sociologist]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[theology|theologian]]. Berger became known for his work in the [[sociology of knowledge]], the [[sociology of religion]], study of [[modernization]], and theoretical contributions to [[sociological theory]]. 

Berger is arguably best known for his book, co-authored with [[Thomas Luckmann]], ''[[The Social Construction of Reality|The Social Construction of Reality: A Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge]]'' (New York, 1966), which is considered one of the most influential texts in the sociology of knowledge and played a central role in the development of [[social constructionism]]. In 1998 the [[International Sociological Association]] named this book as the fifth most-influential book written in the field of sociology during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.isa-sociology.org/en/about-isa/history-of-isa/books-of-the-xx-century/ Books of the XX Century]". International Sociological Association. isa-sociology.org. Retrieved June&amp;nbsp;30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this book, some of the other books that Berger has written include: ''[[Invitation to Sociology: A Humanistic Perspective]]'' (1963); ''[[A Rumor of Angels: Modern Society and the Rediscovery of the Supernatural]]'' (1969); and ''The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Social Theory of Religion'' (1967).&lt;ref name="The Sacred Canopy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aeschliman, M.D. June 2011.

==Biography==

===Family life===

Peter Ludwig Berger was born on March 17, 1929, in Vienna, Austria, to George William and Jelka (Loew) Berger, who were [[Jewish]] converts to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison Smith, ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/peter-berger-sociologist-who-argued-for-ongoing-relevance-of-religion-dies-at-88/2017/07/02/1e5636d0-5f32-11e7-84a1-a26b75ad39fe_story.html Peter Berger, sociologist who argued for ongoing relevance of religion, dies at 88]'', July 2 2017, [[The Washington Post]]&lt;/ref&gt; He died on June 27, 2017, in his [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], home after a prolonged illness.&lt;ref name="RIP Peter berger"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/2017/06/28/rip-founding-director-of-cura-prof-peter-berger-dies-at-88/ |title=RIP: Founding Director of CURA, Prof. Peter Berger, Dies at 88 | publisher = Boston University |date= |accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emigrated to the United States shortly after [[World War II]] in 1946 at the age of 17&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; and in 1952 he became a naturalized citizen.

On September 28, 1959, he married Brigitte Kellner, herself an eminent sociologist who was on the faculty at [[Wellesley College]] and [[Boston University]] where she was the chair of the sociology department at both schools. Brigitte was born in Eastern Germany in 1928. She moved to the United States in the mid-1950s. She was a sociologist who focused on the sociology of the family, arguing that the nuclear family was one of the main causes of modernization. Although she studied traditional families, she supported same-sex relationships. She was on the faculties of Hunter College of the City University of New York, Long Island University, Wellesley College, and Boston University.&lt;ref name="Brigitte Kellner Berger" /&gt; Additionally, she was author of ''Societies in Change'' (1971), ''The Homeless Mind'' (1974), ''The War over the Family'' (1984), and ''The Family in the Modern Age'' (2002).Brigitte Kellner Berger died May 28, 2015. &lt;ref name="Brigitte Kellner Berger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/06/17/an-obituary/ |title=An Obituary: Brigitte Berger, by Peter Berger | publisher = The American Interest |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They had two sons, Thomas Ulrich Berger and Michael George Berger. Thomas is himself a scholar of international relations, now a Professor at the [[Pardee School of Global Studies]] at [[Boston University]] and author of ''War, Guilt and World Politics After World War II'' (2012) and ''Cultures of Antimilitarism: National Security in Germany and Japan'' (2003).&lt;ref name="Thomas Berger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/pardeeschool/profile/thomas-berger/ |title=Profile: Thomas Berger | publisher = Pardee School of Global Studies, Boston University |date= |accessdate=June 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and career===
After the Nazi takeover of Austria in 1938, Berger and his family emigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], then under British rule. He attended a British High school, St. Luke's. Following the German bombings of [[Haifa]], he was evacuated to [[Mt. Carmel]], where he developed his life-long interest in religion. In 1947 Berger and his family emigrated again, this time to the United States, where they settled in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;Peter L. Berger "In Morgenlicht der Erinnerung - Eine Kindheit in turbulenter Zeit (Vienna: Molden Wien, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Berger attended [[Wagner College]] for his [[Bachelor of Arts]] and received his M.A. and Ph.D. from the [[New School]] for Social Research in New York in 1954.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Berger, in his memoir, described himself as an "accidental sociologist", enrolling here in an effort to learn about American society and help become a Lutheran minister, and learning under Alfred Schütz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=Adventures of an Accidental Sociologist: How to Explain the World Without Becoming a Bore|date=2011|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, NY|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 and 1956 he worked at the Evangelische Akademie in [[Bad Boll]], [[West Germany]]. From 1956 to 1958 Berger was an assistant professor at the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]]; from 1958 to 1963 he was an associate professor at [[Hartford Theological Seminary]]. The next stations in his career were professorships at the New School for Social Research, [[Rutgers University]], and [[Boston College]]. Since 1981 Berger was the University Professor of Sociology and Theology at [[Boston University]]. He retired from BU in 2009. In 1985 he founded the Institute for the Study of Economic Culture, which later transformed into the Institute on Culture, Religion and World Affairs (CURA), and is now part of the Boston University [[Pardee School of Global Studies]].&lt;ref name="CURA Website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/PardeeSchool/ |title=Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies  | publisher = Boston University |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained the Director of CURA from 1985 to 2010.&lt;ref name="CURA Website2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/cura/ |title=Institute on Culture, Religion and World Affairs  | publisher = Boston University |date= |accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CURA'''

Berger founded The [[Institute on Culture, Religion, and World Affairs]] at Boston University in 1985. It is a world-center for research, education, and public scholarship on religion and world affairs. Some of the questions it attempts to answer are: How do religion and values affect political, economic, and public ethical developments around the world? Defying earlier forecasts, why have religious actors and ideas become more rather than less globally powerful in recent years? and In a world of increasing religious and ethical diversity, what are the implications of the revival of public religion for citizenship, democracy, and civil coexistence? CURA has over 140 projects in 40 countries.&lt;ref name="CURA Website2" /&gt;

'''Religious views'''

Berger was a moderate Christian [[Lutheran]] conservative whose work in theology, secularization, and modernity at times has challenged the views of contemporary mainstream sociology which tends to lean away from any [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] political thinking. Ultimately, however, Berger's approach to sociology was humanist with special emphasis on "value-free" analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=Adventures of an Accidental Sociologist: How to Explain the World Without Becoming a Bore|date=2011|publisher=Prometheus|location=Amherst|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological thought==

===The social construction of reality===
Human beings construct a shared social reality. This is explained in Berger and Thomas Luckmann's book ''The Social Construction of Reality'' (1966). This reality includes things from ordinary language to large-scale institutions. Our lives are governed by the knowledge about the world that we have and use the information that is relevant to our lives. We take into account typificatory schemes, which are general assumptions about society. As one encounters a new scheme, one must compare it to the ones that are already established in one's mind and determine whether to keep those schemes or replace the old ones with new ones. Social structure is the total of all these typificatory schemes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Society: A Survey of Modern Social Theory|last=Mann|first=Douglas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=978-0-19-542184-2|location=Canada|pages=207–210|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The reality of everyday life====

Berger and Luckmann present this as the sphere of reality that presents itself upon human existence most intensely and immediately. Everyday life is contrasted with other spheres of reality – dreamworlds, theatre – and is considered by a person to be the objective, intersubjective (shared with others) and self-evident.  Life is ordered spatially and temporally. Spatial ordering allows interaction with other people and objects; the human ability to manipulate zones of space can intersect with another's ability.

{{quote|The reality of everyday life is taken for granted as reality. It does not require additional verification over and beyond its simple presence. It is simply there, as self-evident and compelling facticity.&lt;ref name="Anchor" /&gt;}}

Social interactions in everyday life favour personal, face-to-face encounters as the best scenarios where human beings can actually connect with each other through interactions. Humans perceive the other in these interactions as more real than they would themselves; we can place a person in everyday life by seeing them, yet we need to contemplate our own placement in the world as it is not so concrete. Berger believes that although you know yourself on a much deeper scale than you would the other person, they are more real to you because they are constantly making "What he is" available to you. It is difficult to recognize "What I am" without separating oneself from the conversation and reflecting on it. Even then, that self-reflection is caused by the other person's interactions leading to that self contemplation.&lt;ref name="Anchor" /&gt;

Language is imperative to the understanding of everyday life. People understand knowledge through language. The knowledge relevant to us is the only necessary knowledge to our survival, but humans interact through sharing and connecting the relevant structures of our lives with each other.&lt;ref name="Anchor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter L|title=The Social Construction of Reality: a Treatise in the Sociology of Knowledge|date=1966|publisher=Anchor|location=Garden City, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language helps create shared symbols and stocks of knowledge and participation in these things inherently makes us participate in society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Social reality on two levels====

Social reality exists at both the subjective and objective levels. At the subjective level, people find reality personally meaningful and created by human beings in aspects such as personal friendships. At the objective level, people find reality is aspects such as government bureaucracies and large corporations where reality is seen as more out of one's control.

==== Society as objective and subjective ====

Objectively, social order is a product of our social enterprise: it is an ongoing process that results from human activity. Institutions are a product of the historicity and need to control human habitualization (the repeated behaviours or patterns). The shared nature of these experiences and their commonality results in sedimentation, meaning they lose their memorability. Many behaviours lose sedimented institutional meanings. Institutional order involves specified roles for people to play. These roles are seen as performing as this objective figure – an employee is not judged as a human but by that role they have taken.

The process of building a socially-constructed reality takes place in three phases. Initially, externalization is the first step in which humans pour out meaning (both mental and physical) into their reality, thus creating things through language. In externalization, social actors create their social worlds and it is seen through action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following that, reality becomes established by the products of externalization through the course of objectivation (things and ideas "harden" in a sense).&lt;ref name="Anchor" /&gt; People see either a social practice or institution as an objective reality that cannot be changed, such as something like language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, this newly-made, and man-made reality (or society) has an effect on humans themselves. In this third phase, internalization, the external, objective world to a person becomes part of their internal, subjective world.&lt;ref name="Anchor" /&gt; Social actors internalize norms and values, accepting them as givens, and make them our reality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Social Construction of Reality.png|thumb|408x408px|The Social Construction of Reality]]

====Levels of socialization====

Subjectively, we experience first and second socialization into society. Firstly, we are socialized into the world during one's childhood by family members and friends. Secondly, we internalize institutional "sub worlds" during one's adulthood, put in various positions in the economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; We maintain our subjective world through reaffirmation with social interactions with others. Our identity and the society are seen as dialectically related: our identity is formed by social processes, which are in turn ordered by our society.&lt;ref name="Anchor" /&gt; Berger and Luckmann see socialization as very powerful and able to influence things such as sexual and nutritional choices. People have the ability to do whatever they want in these spheres, but socialization causes people to only choose certain sexual partners or certain foods to eat to satisfy biological needs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Humanistic perspective===

The humanistic perspective is generally outside of mainstream, contemporary sociology. It is considered as a view that relates more to the humanities – literature, philosophy – than to social science. Its ultimate purpose lies in freeing society of illusions to help make it more humane. In this sense, we are the "puppets of society," but sociology allows us to see the strings that we are attached to, which helps to free ourselves. Berger's "Invitation to Sociology" outlines his approach to the field of sociology in these humanistic terms. Methodologically, sociologists should attempt to understand and observe human behaviour outside the context of its social setting and free from whatever influence a sociologist's personal biases or feelings might be. The study of sociology, Berger posits, should be value-free. Research should be accrued in the same manner as the scientific method, using observation, hypothesis, testing, data, analysis and generalization. The meaning derived from the results of research should be contextualized with historical, cultural, environmental, or other important data.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=Invitation to Sociology: A Humanist Perspective|date=1963|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===View of sociology===
Berger saw the field of sociology as not only just a way to help people and the community, but sociological insights are also important to all people interested in instilling action in society. Sociologists are a part of a multitude of fields, not just social work. Berger stated that sociology is not a practice, but an attempt to understand the social world. These understandings could be used by people in any field for whatever purpose and with whatever moral implications. He believed that sociologists, even if their values varied greatly, should at the very least have scientific integrity. Sociologists are only humans and will still have to deal with things such as convictions, emotions, and prejudices, but being trained in sociology should learn to understand and control these things and try to eliminate them from their work. A sociologist's job is to accurately report on a certain social terrain. Sociology is a science, and its findings are found through observation of certain rules of evidence that allow people to repeat and continue to develop the findings.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Religion and society ==

===Religion and the human problems of modernity===

Berger believed that society is made aware of what he referred to as the nomos, or the patterns a particular society wants its members to see as objectively right and to internalize. The nomos is all the society's knowledge about how things are, and all of its values and ways of living. This is upheld through legitimacy, either giving special meaning to these behaviors or by creating a structure of knowledge that enhances the plausibility of the nomos. The existence of an eternal cosmic entity that legitimizes a nomos makes the nomos itself eternal; an individual's actions within its set society are all based on a universal and orderly pattern based on their beliefs.&lt;ref name="The Sacred Canopy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=The Sacred Canopy|date=1969|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern pluralization, which has stemmed from the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, set forth a new set of values, including: separation of the religious and secular spheres of life, a person's wealth as a determinant of value, maximizing freedom to enhance wealth, increasing prediction and control to increase wealth, and identifying oneself as a member of a nation-state. This, in turn, spread capitalism and its ideals and beliefs of individualism and rationalization and separated Christians from their Gods. With globalization, even more beliefs and cultures were confronted with this.&lt;ref name="The Sacred Canopy"/&gt;

Berger believed that modernity – technological production paradigms of thinking and bureaucracy, namely – alienated the individual from primary institutions and forced individuals to create separate spheres of public and private life. There is no plausibility structure for any system of beliefs in the modern world; people are made to choose their own with no anchors to our own perceptions of reality. This lowers feelings of belonging and forces our own subjectivities onto themselves. Berger called this a "homelessness of the mind." It is the product of the modern world, he believed, as it has transformed the technology of production into our consciousness, making our cognition componential, always searching for a "means to an end." Ideas and beliefs are varied in the modern world, and an individual, not sharing their system of beliefs with the public whole, relegates any behaviors that are contingent on it to their private life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=The Homelessness of the Mind|date=1974|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain beliefs that an individual has that may not be widely accepted by society as a whole, are then kept to one's self and may only be seen within one's private life and are not seen by society.

The socialist myth, a non-pejorative term of Berger's, actually arises from intellectual leftism masking a need to resolve the lacking sense of community in the modern world through the promise to destroy the oppression of capitalism. Berger believed resolving community in modern society needs to emphasize the role of "mediating structures" in their lives to counter the alienation of modernity. Human existence in the age of modernity requires there to be structures like church, neighbourhood, and family to help establish a sense of belonging rooted in a commitment to values or beliefs. This builds a sense of community and belonging in an individual. In addition, these structures can serve a role in addressing larger social problems without the alienation that larger society creates. The role of mediating structures in civil society is both private and public, in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=Facing Up to Modernity|date=1977|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pluralism ===
The general meaning of pluralism is the coexistence, generally peaceful, of different religions, worldviews, and value systems within the same society. Berger believes pluralism exists in two ways. The first being that many religions and worldviews coexist in the same society. The second is the coexistence of the secular discourse with all these religious discourses. Some people avoid pluralism by only operating within their own secular or religious discourse, meaning they do not interact with others outside of their beliefs. Pluralism generally today is that it is globalized. Berger sees benefits in pluralism. One is that pluralism makes complete consensus in beliefs very rare, which allows people to form and hold their own beliefs without trying to conform to a society that holds all the same beliefs. This ties into the second benefit which is that pluralism gives freedom and allows people free decisions. Another benefit is that if pluralism is connected to religious freedom, religious institutions now become voluntary associations. Lastly, pluralism influences individual believers and religious communities to define the core of their faith separately from less central elements, which allows people to pick and choose certain aspects of their chosen form of belief that they may or may not agree with, while still remaining true to the central parts of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berger|first=Peter L.|year=2016|title=The good of religious pluralism: Peter L. Berger outlines four benefits of pluralism|journal=First Things: A Monthly Journal of Religion and Public Life|volume=262|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transcendence ===

In daily life, people experience symbols and glimpses of existence beyond empirical order and of transcendent existence. Berger calls these "rumours of angels". People feel in times of great joy, in never-ending pursuit of order against chaos, in the existence of objective evil, and in the sense of hope that there exists some supernatural reality beyond that of human existence. People who choose to believe in the existence of a supernatural other require faith – a wager of belief against doubt – in the modern rationalised world. Knowledge can no longer sufficiently ground human belief in the pluralized world, forcing people to wager their own beliefs against the current of doubt in our society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=A Rumor of Angels: Modern Society and the Rediscovery of the Supernatural|date=1970|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secularization theory ===

Like most other sociologists of religion of his day, Berger once predicted the all-encompassing [[secularization]] of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Berger|first=Peter L.|title=The heretical imperative : contemporary possibilities of religious affirmation|year=1979|publisher=Anchor Press|location=Garden City, N.Y.|isbn=0-385-14286-2|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has admitted to his own miscalculations about secularization, concluding that the existence of resurgent religiosity in the modernised world has proven otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=Peter L.|title=The Secularism in Retreat|journal=The National Interest|year=1996|volume=46|url=http://csrs.nd.edu/assets/50014/secularism_in_retreat.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Desecularization of the World'', he cites both Western academia and Western Europe itself as exceptions to the triumphant desecularization hypothesis: that these cultures have remained highly secularized despite the resurgence of religion in the rest of the world. Berger finds that his and most sociologists' misconsensus about secularisation may have been the result of their own bias as members of academia, which is a largely atheist concentration of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=The Desecularization of the World: Resurgent Religion and World Politics|date=1999|publisher=Ethics and Policy Center|location=Grand Rapids, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical contributions==

In ''Making Sense of Modern Times: Peter L. Berger and the Vision of Interpretive Sociology'', [[James Davison Hunter]] and Stephen C. Ainlay build upon the social theories of Berger's. Hunter and Ainlay use Berger's ideologies as a foundation and framework for this particular book. Nicholas Abercrombie begins by examining his reformation of the sociology of knowledge. Shifting his focus on the subjective reality of everyday life, Berger enters a dialogue with traditional sociologies of knowledge – more specific, those of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Karl Mannheim]]. Abercrombie digs deeper into this dialogue Berger brings up, and he considers ways in which Berger goes beyond these figures. Stephen Ainlay then pursues the notable influence on Berger's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ainlay|first=Stephen C.|title=Making Sense of Modern Times: Peter L. Berger and the Vision of Interpretive Sociology|year=1986|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-7102-0826-X|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of sociology, Berger has been somewhat excluded from the mainstream; his humanistic perspective was denounced by much of the intellectual elite in the field, though it sold well over a million copies. Berger's leftist criticisms do not help him much in that regard either. Berger's theories on religion have held considerable weight in contemporary neoconservative and theological fields of thinking, however.&lt;ref name="Prometheus Books"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=Adventures of an Accidental Sociologist: How to Explain the World Without Becoming a Bore|date=2011|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, NY|isbn=978-1-61614-389-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 Berger argued about the emergence of a new [[social class]] he called the "knowledge class". He views it as a result of what was known as the [[middle class]] into two groups: the "old middle class" of those who produce material goods and services and the "knowledge class" whose occupations relate to the production and distribution of "symbolic knowledge." He followed [[Helmut Schelsky]]'s definition of ''Sinn- und Hellsvermittler'', "agents (intemediaries) of meanings and purposes".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rt6tBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT118]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Berger's work was notably influenced by [[Max Weber]]. Weber focused on the empirical realities of rationality as a characteristic of action and rationalization. In comparison, Berger proposed the usage of the word 'options' rather than freedom as an empirical concept. Therefore, much of the empirical work of Berger and Weber have revolved around the relationship between modern rationalization and options for social action. Weber argued that [[rationalism]] can mean a variety of things at the subjective level of consciousness and at the objective level of social institutions. The connection between Berger's analysis of the sociology of religion in modern society and Max Weber's ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' aligns. Weber saw capitalism as a result of the Protestant secularisation of work ethic and morality in amassing wealth, which Berger integrates into his analysis about the effects of losing the non-secular foundations for belief about life's ultimate meaning.

Berger's own experiences teaching in North Carolina in the 1950s showed the shocking American prejudice of that era's Southern culture and influenced his humanistic perspective as a way to reveal the ideological forces from which it stemmed.&lt;ref name="Prometheus Books"/&gt;

==Honors==

In the [[outline of physical science|physical sciences]], a '''phase''' is a region of space (a [[thermodynamic system]]), throughout which all physical properties of a material are essentially uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Modell|first=Michael|author2=Robert C. Reid|title=Thermodynamics and Its Applications |publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ |date=1974 |isbn=978-0-13-914861-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fermi2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Enrico Fermi|title=Thermodynamics|date=25 April 2012|publisher=Courier Corporation|isbn=978-0-486-13485-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86}}&lt;ref name="Adkins1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Clement John Adkins|title=Equilibrium Thermodynamics|date=14 July 1983|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-27456-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} Examples of physical properties include [[density]], [[refractive index|index of refraction]], [[magnetization]] and chemical composition. A simple description is that a phase is a region of material that is chemically uniform, physically distinct, and (often) mechanically separable. In a system consisting of ice and water in a glass jar, the ice cubes are one phase, the water is a second phase, and the humid air is a third phase over the ice and water. The glass of the jar is another separate phase. (See {{section link|state of matter|Glass}})

The term ''phase'' is sometimes used as a synonym for [[state of matter]], but there can be several [[Miscibility|immiscible]] phases of the same state of matter. Also, the term ''phase'' is sometimes used to refer to a set of equilibrium states demarcated in terms of state variables such as pressure and temperature by a [[phase boundary]] on a [[phase diagram]]. Because phase boundaries relate to changes in the organization of matter, such as a change from liquid to solid or a more subtle change from one crystal structure to another, this latter usage is similar to the use of "phase" as a synonym for state of matter. However, the state of matter and phase diagram usages are not [[wikt:commensurate|commensurate]] with the formal definition given above and the intended meaning must be determined in part from the context in which the term is used.

== Types of phases ==
[[File:Steel pd.svg|thumb|left|350px|Iron-carbon [[phase diagram]], showing the conditions necessary to form different phases]]

Distinct phases may be described as different [[state of matter|states of matter]] such as [[gas]], [[liquid]], [[solid]], [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] or [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]. Useful [[mesophase]]s between solid and liquid form other states of matter.

Distinct phases may also exist within a given state of matter. As shown in the diagram for iron alloys, several phases exist for both the solid and liquid states. Phases may also be differentiated based on [[solubility]] as in polar (hydrophilic) or non-polar (hydrophobic). A mixture of water (a polar liquid) and oil (a non-polar liquid) will spontaneously separate into two phases. Water has a very low [[solubility]] (is insoluble) in oil, and oil has a low solubility in water. Solubility is the maximum amount of a solute that can dissolve in a solvent before the solute ceases to dissolve and remains in a separate phase. A mixture can separate into more than two liquid phases and the concept of phase separation extends to solids, i.e., solids can form [[solid solution]]s or crystallize into distinct crystal phases. Metal pairs that are mutually soluble can form [[alloy]]s, whereas metal pairs that are mutually insoluble cannot.

As many as [[multiphasic liquid|eight immiscible liquid phases]] have been observed.{{efn|One such system is, from the top: [[mineral oil]], [[silicone oil]], [[water]], [[aniline]], [[perfluoro(dimethylcyclohexane)]], [[white phosphorus]], [[gallium]], and [[mercury (element)|mercury]]. The system remains indefinitely separated at {{val|45|u=°C}}, where gallium and phosphorus are in the molten state. From {{cite book

}}}} Mutually immiscible liquid phases are formed from water (aqueous phase), hydrophobic organic solvents, perfluorocarbons ([[organofluorine chemistry#Fluorous phases|fluorous phase]]), silicones, several different metals, and also from molten phosphorus. Not all organic solvents are completely miscible, e.g. a mixture of [[ethylene glycol]] and [[toluene]] may separate into two distinct organic phases.{{efn|This phenomenon can be used to help with catalyst recycling in [[Heck reaction|Heck vinylation]]. See {{cite journal

Phases do not need to macroscopically separate spontaneously. [[Emulsion]]s and [[colloid]]s are examples of immiscible phase pair combinations that do not physically separate.

==Phase equilibrium==
Left to equilibration, many compositions will form a uniform single phase, but depending on the temperature and pressure even a single substance may separate into two or more distinct phases. Within each phase, the properties are uniform but between the two phases properties differ.

Water in a closed jar with an air space over it forms a two phase system. Most of the water is in the liquid phase, where it is held by the mutual attraction of water molecules. Even at equilibrium molecules are constantly in motion and, once in a while, a molecule in the liquid phase gains enough kinetic energy to break away from the liquid phase and enter the gas phase. Likewise, every once in a while a vapor molecule collides with the liquid surface and condenses into the liquid. At equilibrium, evaporation and condensation processes exactly balance and there is no net change in the volume of either phase.

At room temperature and pressure, the water jar reaches equilibrium when the air over the water has a humidity of about 3%. This percentage increases as the temperature goes up. At 100&amp;nbsp;°C and atmospheric pressure, equilibrium is not reached until the air is 100% water. If the liquid is heated a little over 100&amp;nbsp;°C, the transition from liquid to gas will occur not only at the surface, but throughout the liquid volume: the water boils.

==Number of phases==
{{see also|Multiphasic liquid}}
[[Image:phase-diag2.svg|thumb|right|280px|A typical phase diagram for a single-component material, exhibiting solid, liquid and gaseous phases. The solid green line shows the usual shape of the liquid–solid phase line. The dotted green line shows the anomalous behavior of water when the pressure increases. The [[triple point]] and the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] are shown as red dots.]]

For a given composition, only certain phases are possible at a given [[temperature]] and pressure. The number and type of phases that will form is hard to predict and is usually determined by experiment. The results of such experiments can be plotted in [[phase diagram]]s.

The phase diagram shown here is for a single component system. In this simple system, which phases that are possible depends only on [[pressure]] and [[temperature]]. The markings show points where two or more phases can co-exist in equilibrium. At temperatures and pressures away from the markings, there will be only one phase at equilibrium.

In the diagram, the blue line marking the boundary between liquid and gas does not continue indefinitely, but terminates at a point called the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]]. As the temperature and pressure approach the critical point, the properties of the liquid and gas become progressively more similar. At the critical point, the liquid and gas become indistinguishable. Above the critical point, there are no longer separate liquid and gas phases: there is only a generic fluid phase referred to as a [[supercritical fluid]]. In water, the critical point occurs at around 647 [[Kelvin|K]] (374&amp;nbsp;°C or 705&amp;nbsp;°F) and 22.064 [[Pascal (pressure)|MPa]].

An unusual feature of the water phase diagram is that the solid–liquid phase line (illustrated by the dotted green line) has a negative slope. For most substances, the slope is positive as exemplified by the dark green line. This unusual feature of water is related to ice having a lower density than liquid water. Increasing the pressure drives the water into the higher density phase, which causes melting.

Another interesting though not unusual feature of the phase diagram is the point where the solid–liquid phase line meets the liquid–gas phase line. The intersection is referred to as the [[triple point]]. At the triple point, all three phases can coexist.

Experimentally, the phase lines are relatively easy to map due to the interdependence of temperature and pressure that develops when multiple phases forms. See [[Gibbs' phase rule]]. Consider a test apparatus consisting of a closed and well insulated cylinder equipped with a piston. By charging the right amount of water and applying heat, the system can be brought to any point in the gas region of the phase diagram. If the piston is slowly lowered, the system will trace a curve of increasing temperature and pressure within the gas region of the phase diagram. At the point where gas begins to condense to liquid, the direction of the temperature and pressure curve will abruptly change to trace along the phase line until all of the water has condensed.

==Interfacial phenomena==
{{further|Surface science}}
Between two phases in equilibrium there is a narrow region where the properties are not that of either phase. Although this region may be very thin, it can have significant and easily observable effects, such as causing a liquid to exhibit [[surface tension]]. In mixtures, some components may preferentially move toward the interface. In terms of modeling, describing, or understanding the behavior of a particular system, it may be efficacious to treat the interfacial region as a separate phase.

==Crystal phases==

A single material may have several distinct solid states capable of forming separate phases. Water is a well-known example of such a material. For example, water [[ice]] is ordinarily found in the hexagonal form [[ice Ih|ice I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;]], but can also exist as the cubic [[ice Ic|ice I&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;]], the [[rhombohedral crystal system|rhombohedral]] [[ice II]], and many other forms. [[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]] is the ability of a solid to exist in more than one crystal form. For pure chemical elements, polymorphism is known as [[allotropy]]. For example, [[diamond]], [[graphite]], and [[fullerene]]s are different allotropes of [[carbon]].

==Phase transitions==
{{main|Phase transition}}
When a substance undergoes a phase transition (changes from one [[state of matter]] to another) it usually either takes up or releases energy. For example, when water evaporates, the increase in kinetic energy as the evaporating molecules escape the attractive forces of the liquid is reflected in a decrease in temperature. The energy required to induce the phase transition is taken from the internal thermal energy of the water, which cools the liquid to a lower temperature; hence evaporation is useful for cooling. See [[Enthalpy of vaporization]]. The reverse process, condensation, releases heat. The heat energy, or enthalpy, associated with a solid to liquid transition is the [[enthalpy of fusion]] and that associated with a solid to gas transition is the [[enthalpy of sublimation]].

&lt;br /&gt;

== Phases out of equilibrium ==
While phases of matter are traditionally defined for systems in thermal equilibrium, work on quantum [[Many body localization|many-body localized]] (MBL) systems has provided a framework for defining phases out of equilibrium. MBL phases never reach thermal equilibrium, and can allow for new forms of order disallowed in equilibrium via a phenomenon known as [[localization protected quantum order.]] The transitions between different MBL phases and between MBL and thermalizing phases are novel dynamical phase transitions whose properties are active areas of research.

A '''photonic laser thruster''' ('''PLT''') is an amplified photonic propulsion thruster for [[space propulsion]] that works on the principle of a photon-pushed sail, generating thrust directly from the [[momentum]] of a [[photon]] from a [[laser]] reflected from a mirror. The thruster, invented by Young K. Bae differs from other [[solar sail]] and [[laser propulsion]] thrusters in that an amplification process is used, in which the incident beam is re-used by being reflected by a stationary mirror, with an amplification stage at each reflection.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite | url = http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2007-6084 | title = Photon Tether Formation Flight (PTFF) for Distributed and Fractionated Space Architectures | last = Bae | first = Young | publisher = American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |year = 2007 |journal = AIAA Space 2007 Conference &amp; Exposition, Long Beach, CA | doi = 10.2514/6.2007-6084 }} Sept. 18-20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite | url = http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2007-6131 | title = Photonic Laser Propulsion (PLP): Photon Propulsion Using an Active Resonant Optical Cavity | last = Bae | first = Young | publisher = American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics  |year = 2007  |journal = AIAA Space 2007 Conference &amp; Exposition, Long Beach, CA | doi = 10.2514/6.2007-6131 }}Sept. 18-20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite | url = http://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2007-6156 | title = Photonic Laser Thruster (PLT): Experimental Prototype Development and Demonstration | last = Bae | first = Young | publisher = American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics | doi = 10.2514/6.2007-6156 |date = 2007 |journal = AIAA Space 2007 Conference &amp; Exposition, Long Beach, CA | page = paper 2007-6156-318}}; Sept. 18-20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Photonic Laser Propulsion: Proof-of-Concept Demonstration|last = Bae|first = Y.K.|date = 2008|journal = AIAA Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets|accessdate = |doi = 10.2514/1.32284|pmid = |volume = 45|issue = 1|pages = 153–155|bibcode = 2008JSpRo..45..153B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because of the recycling of energy, the photonic laser thruster has been demonstrated to be more energy efficient than other laser-pushed sail concepts.

The near-term usage of the photonic laser thruster the earth-orbit applications include propellant-free and thrust-plume-contamination-free spacecraft maneuvering for precision [[Satellite formation flying|formation flying]], large optical and RF [[Synthetic-aperture radar|synthetic aperture]] construction, and [[stationkeeping]].  The usage of the photonic laser thruster for main space propulsion would require scaling-up of the laser power and controlling laser diffraction over interplanetary and interstellar distances. Photonic laser thrusters have a very high [[specific impulse]], and can permit spacecraft to reach much higher speeds that approach a fraction of the light speed, unlike conventional rockets, which are limited by the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fiso.spiritastro.net/telecon/Bae_11-9-16/|title=Breaking the Tyranny of the Rocket Equation|last=Bae|first=Young|date=2016|website=Future In-Space Operations Telecon Presentation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Background===
The use of light for propulsion has been researched since the beginning of the 20th century,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = From a Scientific Heritage|last = Tsander|first = Friedrich|date = 1967|journal = NASA Ttf-541|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  with the analysis of a sail pushed by the pressure of sunlight by [[Friedrich Zander|Friedrich Tsander]].&lt;ref&gt;Tsander, Friedrich (1925). "Problems of flight by jet propulsion: interplanetary flights"; in English translation as  ''NASA Technical Translation F-147'' (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; Photon propulsion has been discussed for decades as a propulsion that could enable interstellar flight.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=GLWHQgAACAAJ}}|date=1 September 1995|isbn=978-0-07-031320-0|title = Space Propulsion Analysis and Design|last = Humble|first = R.W.|publisher = McGraw-Hill Co.|location= New York|pages = 631–683|last2 = Henry|first2 = G.N.|last3 = Larson|first6 = W.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. A. Landis, “The Ultimate Exploration: Approaches to Interstellar Flight,” ''Interstellar Exploration'', Y. Kondo, ed., Apogee Books (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional photonic propulsion, such as laser- or microwave-pushed [[Beam-powered propulsion#Direct impulse|lightsails]], photons transfer their momentum to the sail by reflection. Since, for a sail moving slowly with respect to the speed of light, very little of the energy of the photon is lost on reflection, a theoretical way to increase the efficiency is by recycling photons, bouncing the reflected photons back to the sail by a mirror,&lt;ref name= "metzger" /&gt; resulting in repetitively cycling the photons between two reflective mirrors in an [[optical cavity]].

The photonic thruster utilized this approach of recycling the reflected light, but with the addition of an active material amplifying the beam.

===Development===
The Photonic Laser Thruster (PLT) was invented and developed by Young Bae and his team at Y.K. Bae Corp for use in nanometer precision spacecraft formation under a [[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts]] (NIAC) grant in 2006,&lt;ref name=":18"/&gt; for forming space telescopes and radars. Initial proposed uses include high-precision and high-speed maneuver of small spacecraft, such as formation flying, orbit adjustments, and drag compensation.  In this research Bae discovered that photonic laser thruster was stable against movements of laser mirrors and proved that it can be used for main propulsion.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;  In this program he demonstrated a 100-fold improvement in conversion efficiency, reaching a photon thrust of 35 micronewtons by putting the laser-energizing medium between two mirrors as in typical lasers.

In August 2015, under another NASA program (NIAC, NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts) he demonstrated additional 100-fold improvement, achieving a photon thrust of 3.5 millinewtons.

===Beamed laser propulsion===
{{see also|Laser propulsion|Beam-powered propulsion}}

The limitations posed by the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation|rocket equation]] can be overcome, as long as the reaction mass is not carried by the spacecraft. In the Beamed Laser Propulsion (BLP) concept, the photons are beamed from the photon source to the spacecraft as coherent light. [[Robert L. Forward]] pioneered interstellar propulsion concepts including photon propulsion and [[antimatter rocket]] propulsion.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Forward | first = R.L. | date = 1987 | title = Advanced Space Propulsion Study | url = http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a189218.pdf | journal = AFRL Final Report | page = F04611–86–C–0039 | doi = | pmid = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Forward introduced beamed laser propulsion, aiming at the goal of achieving roundtrip manned [[interstellar travel]].

However, at higher speeds (v&gt;0.1c), owing to the favorable [[Doppler effect|Doppler shift]] energy transfer, onboard photon propulsion becomes much more energy efficient.

Photons transfer their energy to the spacecraft by redshifting due to Doppler shift upon reflection, thus the higher the spacecraft speed, the higher the efficiency. The figure shows the energy transfer efficiency from photons to the spacecraft's [[kinetic energy]] as a function of β=v/c (the spacecraft velocity divided by the light velocity) in photon propulsion. As the spacecraft velocity approaches the light velocity (v≈c), the efficiency of photon propulsion approaches 100%, as if the spacecraft acts like a [[black hole]] in the moving direction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The lower solid curve in the figure represents the efficiency of conventional photon rocket or sail with photon recycling.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The upper solid line represents schematically an example the efficiency of a recycling photon rocket, such as a PLT. At low β, the recycling rocket can have a high thrust amplification factor (in this example, ~3,000), however as β approaches 1, the amplification factor converges to 1 and the overhead of recycling is unneeded. Therefore, these rockets are projected to bridge the efficiency gap.[[File:Photon-Thrust-Amplification.jpg|thumb|Figure 4: Amplification of photon thrust by bouncing photon beams.

==== Photonic laser thruster ====
After 2000 Bae began to investigate photon recycling for use in a nanometer accuracy formation flight, for a [[NASA]]-[[NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts|NIAC]] project called Photon Tether Formation Flight (PTFF).&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bae | first = Young K. | date = 2006-01-20 | title = A Contamination‐Free Ultrahigh Precision Formation Flying Method for Micro‐, Nano‐, and Pico‐Satellites with Nanometer Accuracy | journal = AIP Conference Proceedings | volume = 813 | pages = 1213–1223 | doi = 10.1063/1.2169304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal was to sustain fixed-formation flight with a baseline distance between craft of over 10&amp;nbsp;km, for next generation NASA space missions. In 2006 Bae investigated active resonant optical cavities, in which the optical gain medium is located within the cavity, and coined the term "photonic laser thruster" (PLT) for such thrusters.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"/&gt; [[File:PLT-Mechanism-Diagram.jpg|thumb|Figure 5: Photonic Laser Thruster mechanism diagram shows its laser-like active resonance cavity with a laser gain medium in the cavity.|302x302px]]Initially PLT was proposed.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; It was assumed that the cavity would be sensitive to the stability of the mirrors and other optical parameters as in passive cavities. Bae discovered that he could sustain the resonance with the mirror in his hand.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This would be impossible if the cavity were highly sensitive to cavity perturbations such as moving and tilting. He concluded the gain medium in the cavity actively stabilizes the recycling photon beam, through negative feedback. This encouraged the idea that these thrusters could enable a range of applications well beyond PTFF.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:PLT-Demo-Setup.jpg|thumb|Figure 6: Schematic diagram of the first Photonic Laser Thruster (PLT) demonstration setup in December 2006.|298x298px]] In December 2006, a proof-of-concept of PTFF was demonstrated in a laboratory environment.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Figure 6 illustrates the first demonstration setup, consisting of a concave High Reflectance (HR) mirror, a [[Nd:YAG laser|Nd:YAG]] Diode Pumped Solid State laser gain medium and a flat Output Coupler (OC) mirror. The photon thrust was determined by measuring the difference between the weight of the HR mirror with laser on and that with laser off with the use of a digital scale. Below is an infrared picture of the thruster in action. [[File:PLT-1st-Lab-Demo.jpg|thumb|An infrared picture of the first proof-of-principle demonstration of Photonic Laser Thruster, in which photon thrust was measure on a digital scale by measuring the mirror weight difference with power on and off.|250x250px]]

Figure 7 shows the experimental results of the photon thrust measured as a function of the laser power output through the OC mirror, P, with [[reflectance]] greater than 0.997 according to the manufacturer’s specification. Curve fitting the data resulted in the specific thrust of 20±1&amp;nbsp;µN/W, resulting in the apparent photon momentum multiplication factor of 2,990±150 and the true OC mirror reflectance used in this demonstration of 0.99967±0.00002. The maximum photon thrust demonstrated was 35 μN. When the demonstration setup was operating at thruster levels near or beyond 35&amp;nbsp;µN, the setup became unstable and the gain medium overheated. Therefore, it was realized that thermal management is critical to scaling such thrusters.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;[[File:PLT-Thrust-Data.jpg|thumb|Figure 7: The first PLT demonstration data obtained with an output coupler mirror with 0.99967 reflectance.|265x265px]]

The Doppler shift limits the maximum obtainable velocity of the accelerating mirror and its accommodating spacecraft. Doppler shift effect on the active resonant cavity behavior is an extremely complicated issue.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Optical gain in the laser cavity can only occur for a finite range of optical frequencies. The gain bandwidth is approximately the width of this frequency range. For example, the gain bandwidth of the YAG laser system with the laser wavelength in the order of 1,000&amp;nbsp;nm is in the order of 0.6&amp;nbsp;nm,&lt;ref name="Yariv1989"&gt;{{cite book|title=Quantum electronics|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=UTWg1VIkNuMC}}|date=17 January 1989|isbn=978-0-471-60997-1|last = Yariv|first = A.|publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons}}&lt;/ref&gt; ~ 0.06% of the wavelength. For an order of magnitude estimation, it can be assumed that a thruster utilizing the YAG laser system will be limited by the gain bandwidth to the first order, i.e., its theoretical maximum spacecraft velocity is ~{{val|1.8|e=5|u=m/s}} (180&amp;nbsp;km/s), 0.06% of the light velocity, c=3x10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s. To overcome this redshift limitation, at high operation velocities, wide bandwidth lasers should be used.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Greater thrust requires higher power lasers.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Hagop |last1=Injeyan|first2=Gregory |last2=Goodno|title=High Power Laser Handbook|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=0u0Foaw8wNYC}}|date=5 January 2011|publisher=McGraw Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-160902-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lasers are often designed to maximize power outside the laser cavity, while PLT calls for maximizing laser power inside the cavity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The necessary laser operation parameters to maximize intracavity power (circulating power) in laser cavities are still poorly understood.

[[File:PLT-TDL-System.jpg|thumb|Figure 8: TDL PLT |264x264px]]
Bae and colleagues chose a thin [[disk laser]] and began to develop a PLT in 2013.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Typically, a thin disk laser with a 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm disk thickness can be operated with a 99% output coupler, and provide an intracavity power 100 times larger than extracavity power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Latham | first = William P. | last2 = Lobad | first2 = Ahmed | last3 = Newell | first3 = Tim C. | last4 = Stalnaker | first4 = Don | date = 2010-10-08 | title = 6.5 kW, Yb:YAG Ceramic Thin Disk Laser | journal = AIP Conference Proceedings | volume = 1278 | pages = 758–764 | doi = 10.1063/1.3507169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A schematic diagram of this design is shown in Figure 8. A thin disk gain medium is coated with HR with a reflectivity of up to 99.999% and attached to a heat sink. The recycling photons between the gain medium and the HR mirror located in the mission platform deliver amplified thrust beaming from the resource platform.

In 2014, Bae's group, working under a NASA program (NIAC, NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts), demonstrated intracavity power of 154&amp;nbsp;kW with a 0.6&amp;nbsp;cm diameter thin disk laser, which can be translated into a photon thrust of 1.03&amp;nbsp;mN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nasa.gov/spacetech/niac/2013phaseII_bae.html#.VGqrRvnF_SM|title = Propellantless Spacecraft Formation-Flying and Maneuvering with Photonic Laser Thruster|date = 2013|accessdate = |website = NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC)|publisher = |last =Bae |first =Y.K. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2015, the group successfully [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QICCrlmBjvY&amp;ab_channel=NASAVideo measured] photon thrust up to 1.1&amp;nbsp;mN with a digital scale.

In August 2015, under the NASA program the group successfully [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLEK8Zq7Pk&amp;ab_channel=Y.K.BaeCorporation propelled] a Cube satellite, and demonstrated and measured photon thrust up to 3.5&amp;nbsp;mN with the use of the newly developed NIST/Scientech/Navy radiation pressure sensor. An intracavity power of the photonic laser thruster over 500&amp;nbsp;kW was demonstrated with 500 W laser pumping.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Open problems ====
To date the experimental tests of the photonic thruster are limited to laboratory-scale distances.  The maximum range of operation for a photonic laser thruster, PLT, is yet to be established. Bohn&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Bohn | first = Willy L. | date = 2008-01-01 | volume = 7005 | pages = 70051C–70051C–9 | doi = 10.1117/12.785634 | title = High-Power Laser Ablation VII | chapter = Novel aspects in laser propulsion }}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated a 1&amp;nbsp;km-long laser resonator similar to the PLT cavity, which is an active cavity, in 1995 and proposed that such resonators could scale to 100&amp;nbsp;km.  Recently, 4-km &amp;nbsp;[[Fabry–Pérot interferometer|Fabry–Pérot cavities]], which are passive cavities, but share the same intracavity power multiplication principle with the PLT cavity, have been demonstrated in [[LIGO]] for gravitational wave detection with an intracavity multiplication factor of 280 and an intracavity laser power on the order of 100&amp;nbsp;kW. Based on these results and the state-of-the-art technologies in precision optics, the PLT cavity length over 1,000&amp;nbsp;km is promising. Further studies need to be performed to determine whether the PLT cavity could be scaled for astronomical distances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Likewise, use of the amplifying cavity has not yet been demonstrated for the case when the sail is moving at velocities approaching fractions of the light velocity. The Doppler shift of the moving sail will, as noted earlier, mean that the amplification medium will need to operate at a different wavelength for each pass of the photons through the system. The mode of the Fabry-Perot cavity will likewise be changing with time.

Another issue is intracavity laser beam aiming, aligning and tracking over long distances.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Progress in [[directed energy weapon]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt; has improved these capabilities. The speed of light limits how quickly tracking information can travel between the two cavity ends over long distances.

At speeds higher than rocket speeds lack of brakes is a problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://livestream.com/viewnow/niac2015seattle/videos/105034354 Philip Lubin, Univ. of California Santa Barbara, DEEP IN Directed Propulsion for Interstellar Exploration, since 4:17]&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a problem can be solved by installing another photonic laser thruster at the destination as in photonic railway.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The braking of spacecraft with PLT in lab has been recently demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TzLEK8Zq7Pk&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=February 2018}}

If the photonic laser thruster is scalable for the use in such main space propulsion, multiple photonic laser thrusters can be used to construct a photonic railway that has been proposed as a potential permanent transport infrastructure for interplanetary or interstellar commutes, allowing the transport craft themselves to carry very little or no fuel.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187538921202514X|title = Prospective of photon propulsion for interstellar flight|last = Bae|first = Y.K.|date = 2012|journal = Physics Procedia|accessdate = |doi = 10.1016/j.phpro.2012.08.026|pmid = |volume = 38|pages = 253–279|bibcode = 2012PhPro..38..253B}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The photonic railway&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; was investigated for a space applications involving planets, moons and asteroids both in the solar system and other star systems, such as mining and setting up permanent habitation, with regular interplanetary and interstellar travel.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

For example, platforms could be built in Earth orbit and then used for constructing further platforms at one of the [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange points]] of a planet of interest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For Mars, solar power is still strong, thus solar pumped platforms could be operated near Mars. Planets farther from the sun might not support solar pumping, and the railway would involve two PLT-BLP systems near Earth.

Bae compared the energy need to speed spacecraft for conventional rockets and that for photonic railway or PLT-BLP, in terms of specific energy (J/kg) that is the energy required for propelling a unit mass to a given velocity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Fig. 11 shows examples of the specific energy (J/kg) as a function of the spacecraft velocity (km/s) related with the Mars photonic railway. Two curves represent the specific energies for conventional rockets with I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; = 500 s and 3,000 s, respectively.  The upper straight solid line represents the specific energy for BLP and the lower straight solid line for photonic railway or PLT-BLP with M=1,000.  Here M is the photon thrust amplification factor.  It is interesting that BPL becomes more energy efficient than rockets with I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;=500 s, if the travel time needs to be shorter than 1 month.  BPL becomes more energy efficient than rockets with I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;=3,000 s, if the travel time is shorter than a week. However, photonic railway or PLT-BPL with M=1,000 becomes more energy efficient than rockets with I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;=500 s, if the travel time needs to be shorter than 2 month.  BPL becomes more energy efficient than rockets with I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;=3,000 s, if the travel time needs to be shorter than two weeks. Eventually, when the flight time needs to be 3 days, for example, both BLP and photonic railway or PLT-BLP are more energy efficient than rockets with I&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;=3,000 s.  This estimate demonstrates photonic railway is potentially the most energy efficient way to commute to planets in the solar system.

One interesting aspect of the Spacetrain on the photonic railway was realized that the continuous low level acceleration of up to 1 g will create an artificial gravity that may eliminate or minimize the health effects of [[weightlessness]] long term space travel in zero-gravity environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This artificial gravity will play a crucial role in reducing or eliminating the health problems arising from the typical zero-g space travel environment.

A simple PLT system could provide continuous and constant thrust in a straight line. However, travel around the solar system involves interacting with planets and the sun, so trajectories and travel time calculations are more complex. Fu-Yuen Hsiao has investigated the trajectories of spacecraft relying entirely on a PLT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Trajectory of spacecraft with photonic laser propulsion in the two-body problem|last = Hsiao|first = F.Y.|display-authors = etal|date = 2012|journal = Acta Astronautica|accessdate = |doi = 10.1016/j.actaastro.2012.11.006|pmid = |volume = 84|pages = 215–226|bibcode = 2013AcAau..84..215H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bae's investigation concluded that the development of interplanetary and interstellar photonic railway will require development of the ways to utilize Photon [[Bose Einstein Condensation]] or diffraction-minimized laser beam propagation with non-diffracting beams, such as [[Bessel beam]], or [[x-ray lasers]] and future advanced material science and technologies.  Bae further concluded that the realization of the interstellar photonic railway would require that the PLT technology developments ride on the [[Moore’s law]] as the 20th century silicon devices did.

The '''principles of grouping''' (or '''Gestalt laws of grouping''') are a set of principles in [[psychology]], first proposed by [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt psychologists]] to account for the observation that humans naturally perceive objects as organized patterns and objects, a principle known as [[Prägnanz]]. Gestalt psychologists argued that these principles exist because the mind has an innate disposition to perceive patterns in the stimulus based on certain rules. These principles are organized into five categories: Proximity, Similarity, Continuity, Closure, and Connectedness.&lt;ref name=Gray2006a/&gt;{{sfn|Wolfe|Kluender|Levi|Bartoshuk|2008|pp=78,80}}{{sfn|Goldstein|2009|pp=105&amp;ndash;107}}{{sfn|Banerjee|1994|pp=107&amp;ndash;108}}

[[Irvin Rock]] and Steve Palmer, who are acknowledged as having built upon the work of [[Max Wertheimer]] and others and to have identified additional grouping principles,{{sfn|Weiten|1998|pp=144}} note that Wertheimer's laws have come to be called the "Gestalt laws of grouping" but state that "perhaps a more appropriate description" is "principles of grouping."{{sfn|Palmer|Neff|Beck|1997|pp=63}}{{sfn|Palmer|2003|pp=180&amp;ndash;181}}Rock and Palmer helped to further Wertheimer's research to explain human perception of groups of objects and how we perceive&amp;nbsp;''parts''&amp;nbsp;of objects and form&amp;nbsp;''whole''&amp;nbsp;objects on the basis of these.

== Proximity ==
[[File:Gestalt proximity.svg|left|thumb|Law of Proximity]]
The Gestalt law of proximity states that "objects or shapes that are close to one another appear to form groups". Even if the shapes, sizes, and objects are radically different, they will appear as a group if they are close.

* Refers to the way smaller elements are "assembled" in a composition.
* Also called "grouping," the principle concerns the effect generated when the collective presence of the set of elements becomes more meaningful than their presence as separate elements.
* Arranging words into sentences or titles is an obvious way to group unrelated elements to enhance their meaning (it also depends on a correct order for [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]]).
* Grouping the words also changes the [[visual]] and [[psychological]] meaning of the composition in non-verbal ways unrelated to their meaning.
* Elements which are grouped together create the illusion of shapes or planes in space, even if the elements are not touching.
* Grouping of this sort can be achieved with tone or value, color, shape, size, or other physical attributes.

== Similarity ==
[[File:Gestalt similarity.svg|left|thumb|Law of Similarity]]
The principle of similarity states that, all else being equal, [[perception]] lends itself to seeing [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] that physically resemble each other as part of the same object, and stimuli that are different as part of a different object. This allows for people to distinguish between adjacent and overlapping objects based on their visual texture and resemblance. Other stimuli that have different features are generally not perceived as part of the object.  Our [[brain]] uses similarity to distinguish between objects which might lie  adjacent to or overlap with each other based upon their visual texture.  An example of this is a large area of land used by numerous independent farmers to grow crops.  Each farmer may use a unique planting style which distinguishes his field from another.  Another example is a field of flowers which differ only by color.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The principles of similarity and proximity often work together to form a Visual Hierarchy. Either principle can dominate the other, depending on the application and combination of the two. For example, in the grid to the left, the similarity principle dominates the proximity principle and you probably see rows before you see columns.

== Closure ==
[[File:Gestalt closure.svg|left|thumb|Law of Closure]]
The principle of closure refers to the [[mind]]’s tendency to see complete figures or forms even if a picture is incomplete, partially hidden by other objects, or if part of the information needed to make a complete [[picture]] in our [[mind]]s is missing.  For example, if part of a shape’s border is missing people still tend to see the shape as completely enclosed by the border and ignore the gaps. This reaction stems from our mind’s natural tendency to recognize patterns that are familiar to us and thus fill in any [[information]] that may be missing.

Closure is also thought to have evolved from ancestral survival instincts in that if one was to partially see a predator their mind would automatically complete the picture and know that it was a time to react to potential danger even if not all the necessary information was readily available.

== Good continuation ==
[[File:CrossKeys.png|left|thumb|Law of good continuation]]
When there is an intersection between two or more objects, people tend to perceive each object as a single uninterrupted object. This allows differentiation of stimuli even when they come in visual overlap. We have a tendency to group and organize lines or curves that follow an established direction over those defined by sharp and abrupt changes in directionamasing...{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}
{{clear left}}

== Common fate ==
[[File:Red-billed quelea flocking at waterhole.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Law of common fate—a [[Flock (birds)|flock of birds]].]]
When visual elements are seen moving in the same direction at the same rate ([[optical flow]]), perception associates the movement as part of the same stimulus. For example, birds may be distinguished from their background as a single flock because they are moving in the same direction and at the same velocity, even when each bird is seen—from a distance—as little more than a dot. The moving 'dots' appear to be part of a unified whole. Similarly, two flocks of birds can cross each other in a viewer's visual field, but they will nonetheless continue to be experienced as separate flocks because each bird has a direction common to its flock.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

This allows people to make out moving objects even when other details (such as the objects color or outline) are obscured. This ability likely arose from the evolutionary need to distinguish a [[camouflage]]d predator from its background.

The law of common fate is used extensively in user-interface design, for example where the movement of a [[scrollbar]] is synchronised with the movement (i.e. cropping) of a window's [[Virtual desktop|content viewport]]; The movement of a physical mouse is synchronised with the movement of an on-screen arrow cursor, and so on.

== Good form ==
[[File:Olympic Rings.svg|thumb|left|Principle of good form]]
The principle of good form refers to the tendency to group together forms of similar shape, pattern, color, etc.  Even in cases where two or more forms clearly  overlap, the human brain interprets them in a way that allows people to differentiate different patterns and/or shapes. An example would be a pile of presents where a dozen packages of different size and shape are wrapped in just three or so patterns of wrapping paper, or the Olympic Rings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9557">In [[mathematics]] and [[mathematical physics]], '''raising and lowering indices''' are operations on [[tensor]]s which change their [[Type of a tensor|type]].  Raising and lowering indices are a form of [[Ricci calculus|index manipulation]] in tensor expressions.

==Tensor type==

Given a [[tensor field]] on a [[manifold]] {{mvar|M}}, in the presence of a [[nonsingular form]] on {{mvar|M}} (such as a [[Riemannian metric]] or [[Minkowski metric]]), one can raise or lower indices to change a type {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} tensor to a {{math|(''a'' + 1, ''b'' − 1)}} tensor (raise index) or to a {{math|(''a'' − 1, ''b'' + 1)}} tensor (lower index), where the notation {{math|(''a'', ''b'')}} has been used to denote the [[Tensor#As multidimensional arrays|tensor order]] {{math|''a'' + ''b''}} with {{mvar|a}} upper indices and {{mvar|b}} lower indices.

One does this by multiplying by the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant or contravariant]] [[metric tensor]] and then [[Tensor contraction|contracting]] indices, meaning two indices are set equal and then summing over the repeated indices (applying [[Einstein notation]]). See examples below.

==Vectors (order-1 tensors)==

Multiplying by the ''contravariant'' metric tensor {{mvar|g&lt;sup&gt;ij&lt;/sup&gt;}} and contracting produces another tensor with an upper index:

:&lt;math&gt;g^{ij}A_j=B^i\,,&lt;/math&gt;

The same base symbol is typically used to denote this new tensor, and repositioning the index is typically understood in this context to refer to this new tensor, and is called ''raising the index'', which would be written

:&lt;math&gt;g^{ij}A_j=A^i\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, multiplying by the ''covariant'' metric tensor and contracting ''lowers'' an index (with the same understanding about the reuse of the base symbol):

:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}A^j=A_i\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The form {{mvar|g&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;}} need not be nonsingular to lower an index, but to get the inverse (and thus raise an index) it must be nonsingular.

Raising and then lowering the same index (or conversely) are inverse operations, which is reflected in the covariant and contravariant metric tensors being inverse to each other:

:&lt;math&gt;g^{ij}g_{jk}=g_{kj}g^{ji}={\delta^i}_k={\delta_k}^i&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|δ&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Kronecker delta]] or [[identity matrix]]. Since there are different choices of metric with different [[metric signature]]s (signs along the diagonal elements, i.e. tensor components with equal indices), the name and signature is usually indicated to prevent confusion. Different authors use different metrics and signatures for different reasons.

Mnemonically (though ''incorrectly''), one could think of indices "cancelling" between a metric and another tensor, and the metric stepping up or down the index. In the above examples, such "cancellations" and "steps" are like

:&lt;math&gt;g^{ij}A_j = \cancel{g}^{i \cancel{j}}A_\cancel{j} = A^i\,,&lt;/math&gt;

Again, while a helpful guide, this is only mnemonical and not a property of tensors since the indices do not cancel like in equations, it is only a concept of the notation. The results are continued below, for higher order tensors (i.e. more indices).

When raising indices of quantities in spacetime, it helps to decompose summations into "timelike components" (where indices are zero) and "spacelike components" (where indices are 1, 2, 3, represented conventionally by Latin letters).

===An example from [[Minkowski spacetime]]===

The covariant [[4-position]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;X_\mu = (-ct, x, y, z)&lt;/math&gt;

with components:
:&lt;math&gt;X_0 = -ct, \quad X_1 = x, \quad X_2 = y, \quad X_3 = z&lt;/math&gt;

(where {{mvar|x}},{{mvar|y}},{{mvar|z}} are the usual [[Cartesian coordinates]]) and the [[Minkowski metric]] tensor with signature (− + + +) is defined as
:&lt;math&gt; \eta_{\mu \nu} = \eta^{\mu \nu} = \begin{pmatrix}
  -1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

in components:
:&lt;math&gt;\eta_{00} = -1, \quad \eta_{i0} = \eta_{0i} = 0,\quad \eta_{ij} = \delta_{ij}\,(i,j \neq 0).&lt;/math&gt;

To raise the index, multiply by the tensor and contract:
:&lt;math&gt;X^\lambda = \eta^{\lambda\mu}X_\mu = \eta^{\lambda 0}X_0 + \eta^{\lambda i}X_i&lt;/math&gt;

then for {{math|''λ'' {{=}} 0}}:
:&lt;math&gt;X^0 = \eta^{00}X_0 + \eta^{0i}X_i = -X_0&lt;/math&gt;

and for {{math|''λ'' {{=}} ''j'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}}:
:&lt;math&gt;X^j = \eta^{j0}X_0 + \eta^{ji}X_i = \delta^{ji}X_i = X_j \,.&lt;/math&gt;

So the index-raised contravariant 4-position is:
:&lt;math&gt;X^\mu = (ct, x, y, z)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Tensors (higher order)==

===Order 2===

For an order-2 tensor,&lt;ref name="Schaum’s Outlines"&gt;{{cite book |title=Tensor Calculus |first=D. C. |last=Kay |series=Schaum’s Outlines |publisher=McGraw Hill |location=New York |year=1988 |isbn=0-07-033484-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; twice multiplying by the contravariant metric tensor and contracting in different indices raises each index:

:&lt;math&gt;A^{\alpha\beta}=g^{\alpha\gamma}g^{\beta\delta}A_{\gamma \delta}&lt;/math&gt;

and twice multiplying by the covariant metric tensor and contracting in different indices lowers each index:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\alpha\beta}=g_{\alpha\gamma}g_{\beta\delta}A^{\gamma \delta}&lt;/math&gt;

====An example from [[classical electromagnetism and special relativity]]====

The [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] [[electromagnetic tensor]] in the {{math|(+ − − −)}} signature is given by&lt;ref&gt;NB: Some texts, such as: {{cite book | author=Griffiths, David J. | authorlink = David J. Griffiths |  title=Introduction to Elementary Particles | publisher=Wiley, John &amp; Sons, Inc | year=1987 | isbn=0-471-60386-4}}, will show this tensor with an overall factor of −1. This is because they used the negative of the metric tensor used here: {{math|(− + + +)}}, see [[sign convention#Metric signature|metric signature]]. In older texts such as Jackson (2nd edition), there are no factors of {{mvar|c}} since they are using [[Gaussian units]]. Here [[SI units]] are used.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;F^{\alpha\beta} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; -\frac{E_x}{c} &amp; -\frac{E_y}{c} &amp; -\frac{E_z}{c} \\
\frac{E_x}{c} &amp; 0 &amp; -B_z &amp; B_y \\
\frac{E_y}{c} &amp; B_z &amp; 0 &amp; -B_x \\
\frac{E_z}{c} &amp; -B_y &amp; B_x &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

in components:

:&lt;math&gt;F^{0i} = -F^{i0} = - \frac{E^i}{c} ,\quad F^{ij} = - \varepsilon^{ijk} B_k &lt;/math&gt;

To obtain the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] tensor {{mvar|F&lt;sub&gt;αβ&lt;/sub&gt;}}, multiply by the metric tensor and contract:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F_{\alpha\beta} &amp; = \eta_{\alpha\gamma} \eta_{\beta\delta} F^{\gamma\delta} \\
&amp; = \eta_{\alpha 0} \eta_{\beta 0} F^{0 0} + \eta_{\alpha i} \eta_{\beta 0} F^{i 0}
+ \eta_{\alpha 0} \eta_{\beta i} F^{0 i} + \eta_{\alpha i} \eta_{\beta j} F^{i j}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and since ''F''&lt;sup&gt;00&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 and ''F''&lt;sup&gt;0''i''&lt;/sup&gt; = − ''F&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, this reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha\beta} = \left(\eta_{\alpha i} \eta_{\beta 0} - \eta_{\alpha 0} \eta_{\beta i} \right) F^{i 0} + \eta_{\alpha i} \eta_{\beta j} F^{i j}&lt;/math&gt;

Now for {{math|''α'' {{=}} 0}}, {{math|''β'' {{=}} ''k'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F_{0k} &amp; = \left(\eta_{0i} \eta_{k0} - \eta_{00} \eta_{ki} \right) F^{i0} + \eta_{0i} \eta_{kj} F^{ij} \\
&amp; = \bigl(0 - (-\delta_{ki}) \bigr) F^{i0} + 0 \\
&amp; = F^{k0} = - F^{0k} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and by antisymmetry, for {{math|''α'' {{=}} ''k'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}}, {{math|''β'' {{=}} 0}}:

:&lt;math&gt; F_{k0} = - F^{k0} &lt;/math&gt;

then finally for {{math|''α'' {{=}} ''k'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}}, {{math|''β'' {{=}} ''l'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3}};

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
F_{kl} &amp; = \left(\eta_{ k  i} \eta_{ l  0} - \eta_{ k  0} \eta_{ l  i} \right) F^{i 0} + \eta_{ k  i} \eta_{ l  j} F^{i j} \\
&amp; = 0 + \delta_{ k  i} \delta_{ l  j} F^{i j} \\
&amp; = F^{k l} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The (covariant) lower indexed tensor is then:

:&lt;math&gt;F_{\alpha\beta} = \begin{pmatrix}
0 &amp; \frac{E_x}{c} &amp; \frac{E_y}{c} &amp; \frac{E_z}{c} \\
-\frac{E_x}{c} &amp; 0 &amp; -B_z &amp; B_y \\
-\frac{E_y}{c} &amp; B_z &amp; 0 &amp; -B_x \\
-\frac{E_z}{c} &amp; -B_y &amp; B_x &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

===Order ''{{mvar|n}}''===

When a vector space is equipped with an inner product (or metric as it is often called in this context), there exist operations that convert a contravariant (upper) index into a covariant (lower) index and vice versa. A metric itself is a (symmetric) (0,2)-tensor, it is thus possible to contract an upper index of a tensor with one of the lower indices of the metric. This produces a new tensor with the same index structure as the previous, but with lower index in the position of the contracted upper index. This operation is quite graphically known as lowering an index.
Conversely, a metric has an inverse which is a (2,0)-tensor. This inverse metric can be contracted with a lower index to produce an upper index. This operation is called raising an index.

For a tensor of order {{mvar|n}}, indices are raised by:&lt;ref name="Schaum’s Outlines" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;g^{i_1j_1}g^{i_2j_2}\cdots g^{i_nj_n}A_{i_1i_2\cdots i_n} = A^{j_1j_2\cdots j_n}&lt;/math&gt;

and lowered by:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{i_1j_1}g_{i_2j_2}\cdots g_{i_nj_n}A^{i_1i_2\cdots i_n} = A_{j_1j_2\cdots j_n}&lt;/math&gt;

and for a mixed tensor:

:&lt;math&gt;g_{i_1p_1}g_{i_2p_2}\cdots g_{i_np_n}g^{j_1q_1}g^{j_2q_2}\cdots g^{j_mq_m}{A^{i_1i_2\cdots i_n}}_{j_1j_2\cdots j_m} = {A_{p_1p_2\cdots p_n}}^{q_1q_2\cdots q_m}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5055">'''Redistributive change''' is a [[legal theory]] of [[economic justice]] in the context of [[U.S. law]] that promotes the recognition of [[poverty]] as a [[suspect classification|classification]], like [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[gender]], and [[religion]], that should likewise draw extra [[Strict scrutiny|scrutiny]] from the courts in matters pertaining to [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name=Bazelon&gt;{{cite web

The theory was discussed in academia in the wake of ''[[Goldberg v. Kelly]]'', a 1970 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] case, which decided that [[due process]], such as a notice and a [[fair hearing]], were required when dealing with the deprivation of a government benefit (such as a [[medical license]]) or an [[entitlement]] (such as [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare payments]]).&lt;ref name=Bazelon/&gt;  However, attempts to promote redistributive change through the courts gained no traction, and the result of ''Goldberg v. Kelly'' was, thus, limited in scope.&lt;ref name=Bazelon/&gt; 

One of the goals, in light of ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'', was to promote equality in [[Education in the United States|school funding]], but this was specifically rejected by the Supreme Court in ''[[San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez]]'' (1973), which ruled that there was no inherent [[right to education]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=Helfrich&gt;{{cite web

 |quote        = A classic example would be something like public education, where after Brown v. Board, a major issue ends up being redistribution -- how do we get more money into the schools, and how do we actually create equal schools and equal educational opportunity? Well, the court in a case called San Antonio v. Rodriguez in the early '70s basically slaps those kinds of claims down, and says, 'You know what, we as a court have no power to examine issues of redistribution and wealth inequalities. With respect to schools, that's not a race issue, that's a wealth issue and something we can't get into.'

'''Row2Recovery''' is a British unincorporated Association of volunteers which assists military  [[Adaptive rowing|adaptive-rowing]]. The Association has completed four Atlantic adaptive-rowing crossings and, when a charity, supported a national adaptive-rowing programme for the British military wounded, injured and sick in partnership with [[British Rowing]] and [[Help for Heroes]]. Row2Recovery was founded in 2010 by former  [[Captain (armed forces)|Army-Captains]] Edward Janvrin and Alexander Mackenzie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kendall|first1=Paul|date=29 January 2012|title=Row2Recovery: We made it at last!|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/features/9046933/Row2Recovery-We-made-it-at-last.html|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=Daily Telegraph online |location=(London) |quote=EdJanvrin and Alex Mackenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew was made of up of four servicemen who had been wounded in action and two able-bodied servicemen. 50 days, 23 hours and 12 minutes later,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oceanrowing.com/statistics/ocean_rowing_records_all5.htm |title=Chronological Listing of All Ocean Rows |website=www.oceanrowing.com |publisher=The Ocean Rowing Society International |access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team Sealegs arrived in Port St Charles,  [[Barbados]] on 25 January 2012.
The 2011/12 Crew consisted of:

The '''Russell–Einstein Manifesto''' was issued in London on 9 July 1955 by [[Bertrand Russell]] in the midst of the [[Cold War]]. It highlighted the dangers posed by [[nuclear weapons]] and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict. The signatories included eleven pre-eminent intellectuals and scientists, including [[Albert Einstein]], who signed it just days before his death on 18 April 1955. A few days after the release, philanthropist [[Cyrus S. Eaton]] offered to sponsor a conference—called for in the manifesto—in [[Pugwash, Nova Scotia]], Eaton's birthplace. This conference was to be the first of the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]], held in July 1957.

==Background==
{{main|History of nuclear weapons|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki}}
The first detonation of an atomic weapon took place on 16 July 1945 in the desert north of [[Alamogordo]], [[New Mexico]]. On 6 August 1945, the US dropped ''[[Little Boy]]'' on the Japanese city of [[Hiroshima]] and, three days later, ''[[Fat Man]]'' on [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. At least 100,000 civilians were killed outright by these two bombings.

On 18 August 1945, the ''Glasgow Forward'' published "The Bomb and Civilisation," the first known recorded comment by Bertrand Russell on atomic weapons, which he began composing the day Nagasaki was bombed. It contained threads that would later appear in the manifesto:

{{Quote|The prospect for the human race is sombre beyond all precedent. Mankind are faced with a clear-cut alternative: either we shall all perish, or we shall have to acquire some slight degree of common sense. A great deal of new political thinking will be necessary if utter disaster is to be averted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.kent.edu/~rmuhamma/Philosophy/RBwritings/bombCivilization.htm Bertrand Russell, "The Bomb and Civilisation."]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After learning of the bombing of Hiroshima and seeing an impending [[nuclear arms race]], [[Joseph Rotblat]], the only scientist to leave the [[Manhattan Project]] on moral grounds, remarked that he "became worried about the whole future of mankind".

Over the years that followed Russell and Rotblat worked on efforts to curb nuclear proliferation, collaborating with Albert Einstein and other scientists to compose what became known as the '''Russell–Einstein Manifesto'''.

==Press conference, 9 July 1955==
The manifesto was released during a press conference at [[Caxton Hall]], London. Rotblat, who chaired the meeting, describes it as follows:

{{Quote|It was thought that only a few of the Press would turn up and a small room was booked in Caxton Hall for the Press Conference. But it soon became clear that interest was increasing and the next larger room was booked. In the end the largest room was taken and on the day of the Conference this was packed to capacity with representatives of the press, radio and television from all over the world. After reading the Manifesto, Russell answered a barrage of questions from members of the press, some of whom were initially openly hostile to the ideas contained in the Manifesto. Gradually, however, they became convinced by the forcefulness of his arguments, as was evident in the excellent reporting in the Press, which in many cases gave front page coverage.}}

Russell had begun the conference by stating:

{{Quote|I am bringing the warning pronounced by the signatories to the notice of all the powerful Governments of the world in the earnest hope that they may agree to allow their citizens to survive.}}

==Synopsis==
The manifesto called for a conference where scientists would assess the dangers posed to the survival of humanity by [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Emphasis was placed on the meeting being politically neutral. It extended the question of nuclear weapons to all people and governments. One particular phrase is quoted often, including by Rotblat upon receipt of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1995:

{{Quote|Remember your humanity, and forget the rest.}}

==The beginnings of the Pugwash Conferences==
The manifesto called for an international conference, and was originally planned by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to be held in [[India]]. This was delayed by the outbreak of the [[Suez Crisis]]. [[Aristotle Onassis]] offered to finance a meeting in [[Monaco]], but this was rejected. Instead, Cyrus Eaton, a Canadian industrialist who had known Russell since 1938, offered to finance the conference in his hometown of Pugwash, Nova Scotia. The '''Russell–Einstein Manifesto''' became the [[Pugwash Conferences]]' founding charter. The first of the conferences was held in July 1957 in London.

==Signatories to the manifesto==

'''School violence''' encompasses physical violence, including student-on-student fighting and [[corporal punishment]]; [[Psychological abuse|psychological violence]], including verbal abuse; [[sexual violence]], including rape and sexual harassment; many forms of [[bullying]], including [[cyberbullying]]; and carrying weapons in school.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002469/246970e.pdf|title=School Violence and Bullying: Global Status Report|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100197-0|location=|pages=9, 110–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely held to have become a serious problem in recent decades in many countries, especially where weapons such as guns or knives are involved. It includes [[violence]] between school students as well as  physical attacks by students on school staff.

==Risk factors==

===Internalizing and externalizing behaviors===

A distinction is made between internalizing and externalizing behavior. Internalizing behaviors reflect withdrawal, inhibition, anxiety, and/or [[depression (mood)|depression]]. Internalizing behavior has been found in some cases of youth violence although in some youth, depression is associated with substance abuse. Because they rarely act out, students with internalizing problems are often overlooked by school personnel.&lt;ref name="Christie"&gt;Christie, C.A., Nelson, C.M., &amp; Jolivet, K. (2005). [http://www.edjj.org/focus/prevention/plr.pdf ''Prevention of antisocial and violent behavior in youth: A review of the literature''.] Lexington, KY: University of Kentucky. Retrieved 2009-05-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Externalizing behaviors refer to delinquent activities, aggression, and hyperactivity. Unlike internalizing behaviors, externalizing behaviors include, or are directly linked to, violent episodes. Violent behaviors such as punching and kicking are often learned from observing others.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1983). Psychological mechanisms of aggression. In R. G. Geen &amp; E. I. Donnerstein (Eds.), ''Aggression: Theoretical and empirical reviews''. New York: Academic. {{ISBN|0-12-278801-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="akers"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Akers | first1 = R.

===Other individual factors===

A number of other individual factors are associated with higher levels of aggressiveness. Compared to children whose antisocial conduct begins in adolescence, early starters have a worse prognosis in terms of future aggression and other antisocial activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0954579498001734 | last1 = Patterson | first1 = G.

===Home environment===
The home environment is thought to contribute to school violence. The Constitutional Rights Foundation suggests long-term exposure to [[gun]] violence, parental [[alcoholism]], [[domestic violence]], physical abuse of the child, and child sexual abuse teaches children that criminal and violent activities are acceptable.&lt;ref name="CRE"&gt;Constitutional Rights Foundation. (1997). [http://www.crf-usa.org/school-violence/causes-of-school-violence.html  ''Causes of school violence'']. Retrieved on April 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Harsh parental discipline is associated with higher levels of aggressiveness in youth.&lt;ref name="Sampson"/&gt; There is some evidence indicating that exposure to [[television violence]]&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, B.

Straus adduced evidence for the view that exposure to parental [[Corporal punishment in the home|corporal punishment]] increases the risk of aggressive conduct in children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1525/sp.1991.38.2.03a00010 | last1 = Straus | first1 = M.

Gerald Patterson's social interactional model, which involves the mother's application and the child's counterapplication of ''coercive'' behaviors, also explains the development of aggressive conduct in the child.&lt;ref name="Patterson"&gt;Patterson, G. (1982). ''Coercive family process''. Eugene, OR: Castalia. {{ISBN|0-916154-02-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G. R. (1995). Coercion as a basis for early age of onset for arrest. In J. McCord (Ed.), ''Coercion and punishment in long-term perspectives'' (pp. 81–105). New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, coercive behaviors include behaviors that are ordinarily punishing (e.g., whining, yelling, hitting, etc.). Abusive home environments can inhibit the growth of social cognitive skills needed, for example, to understand the intentions of others.&lt;ref name="CRE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dodge, Pettit"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0021-843X.104.4.632 | last1 = Dodge | first1 = K.

==Prevention and intervention==
The goal of prevention and intervention strategies is to stop school violence from occurring. According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], there are at least four levels at which violence-prevention programs can act: at the level of society in general, the school community, the family, and the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

* Teachers are the professional group who works directly where school bullying takes place and who spends the most time with both bullies, victims and bystanders.

== Challenges in measuring violence in schools ==
Research on violence affecting children in schools is challenging for a variety of reasons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Methodological issues ===
When trying to measure the scope of violence in schools and to find out about the types of violence experienced by students, some key issues include: from what categories of the school community to collect the data; what data should be collected from each categories; and using which methods. For example, should there be studies or surveys where researchers ask students directly about violence in school, through self-reports about the violence they experienced as targets or perpetrators? Or should they be asked about incidents of violence that they have witnessed as bystanders? Should any of these questions be asked via self-administered questionnaires or questionnaires administered by researchers in schools? Does it make more sense to collect this data outside of schools, for example, through household surveys? Or through online surveys where students have access to the internet? Or is it better to rely on mechanisms for reporting incidents of violence in educational institutions when they are available, either in the schools themselves or outside schools (governmental hotlines, internet-based reporting systems, police and justice sectors, etc.)? What questions can be asked of children, using terminology that is easy to understand, age-appropriate and culturally sensitive?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Legal and ethical issues ===
In most countries there are strict rules related to research involving children, as they are under the age of consent. Therefore, requesting informed consent from the children in a study involves their parents and guardians. Asking children about violence, and particularly violence they have experienced themselves, can be traumatic. Finally, researching [[Education and the LGBT community|issues related to sexual orientation and gender identity/orientation in education]] and in relation to children has additional challenges. In some contexts it is not legal to discuss these issues either in schools or even outside of schools. Where it is legal, it may be considered as a very sensitive topic to be discussed with children and young people. Asking children and young people questions related to their sexual orientation and gender identity in the school setting is ethically questionable, as it could embarrass them and expose them to stigma and discrimination, unless questions are asked in strict confidence and anonymity is granted by independent researchers external to schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Self-experimentation''' refers to the special case of [[single-subject research]] in which the experimenter conducts the [[experiment]] on themself. Usually this means that a single person is the designer, operator, subject, analyst, and user or reporter of the experiment.

Current champions of self-experimentation include the late [[Seth Roberts]], [[Tim Ferriss]], and a sprawling  community of [[Quantified Self]]

Human scientific self-experimentation principally (though not necessarily) falls into the fields of medicine and psychology. Self-experimentation has a long and well-documented history in medicine which continues to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Who Goes First?: The Story of Self-Experimentation in Medicine by Lawrence Altman&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, after failed attempts to infect piglets in 1984, [[Barry Marshall]] drank a [[petri dish]] of the [[Helicobacter pylori]] from a patient, and soon developed gastritis, [[achlorhydria]], stomach discomfort, nausea, vomiting, and [[halitosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Gut Instincts: A profile of Nobel laureate Barry Marshall| url=https://news.psu.edu/story/140921/2008/02/04/research/gut-instincts-profile-nobel-laureate-barry-marshall | author = Melissa Beattie-Moss

==Psychology==

The self-experimental approach has long and often been applied to practical psychological problems. [[Benjamin Franklin]] recorded his self-experiment of successively devoting his attention for a week to one of thirteen "Virtues", "leaving the other Virtues to their ordinary Chance, only marking every Evening the Faults of the Day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin | editor = Frank Woodworth Pine | date=1916 | url=https://excellence-in-literature.com/benjamin-franklin-13-virtues/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, Part 2 |url=http://www.ushistory.org/franklin/autobiography/page35.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychology, the best-known self-experiments are the memory studies of [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]], which established many basic characteristics of human memory through tedious experiments involving nonsense syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hermann |last=Ebbinghaus |date=1913 |title=Über das Gedächtnis. Untersuchungen zur experimentellen Psychologie |publisher=NY Teachers College}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Self-change: Strategies for solving personal problems'', M. J. Mahoney suggested that self-experimentation be used as a method of psychological treatment, and recommended that clients be taught basic scientific methods, in order that the client become a "personal scientist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Mahoney, M. J. |date = 1979 | title=Self-change: Strategies for solving personal problems | publisher =  New York: Norton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry==

Several popular and well-known sweeteners were discovered by deliberate or sometimes accidental tasting of reaction products. [[Sucralose]] was discovered by a scientist mishearing the instruction to "test" the compounds as to "taste" the compounds.&lt;ref name="Gratzer2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gratzer|first=Walter |title=Eurekas and Euphorias: The Oxford Book of Scientific Anecdotes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4eTIxt6sN2oC&amp;pg=PT32|accessdate=1 August 2012|date=28 November 2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280403-7|pages=32–|chapter=5. Light on sweetness: the discovery of aspartame}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fahlberg noticed a sweet taste on his fingers and associated the taste with his work in the chemistry labs at [[Johns Hopkins]]; out of that taste test came [[Saccharin]]. [[Cyclamate]] was discovered when a chemist noticed a sweet taste on his cigarette that he had set down on his bench. [[Aspartame]] was also discovered accidentally when chemist Schlatter tasted a sweet substance that had stuck to his hand.  [[Acesulfame potassium]] is another sweetener discovered when a chemist tasted what he had made.

[[Leo Sternbach]], the inventor of [[Librium]] and [[Valium]], tested chemicals that he made on himself, saying in an interview, "I tried everything. Many drugs. Once, in the sixties, I was sent home for two days. It was an extremely potent drug, not a Benzedrine. I slept for a long time. My wife was very worried."&lt;ref&gt;"Little Helper", Nick Paumgarten, ''The New Yorker'', June 16, 2003, pp. 71-72. [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/06/16/030616ta_talk_paumgarten]&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss chemist [[Albert Hofmann]] first discovered the [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] properties of [[LSD]] five years after its creation, when he [[History of lysergic acid diethylamide#Discovery|accidentally]] absorbed a small amount of the drug through his fingertips. Days later, he [[History of lysergic acid diethylamide#.22Bicycle Day.22|intentionally]] self-experimented with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shroder|first1=Tom|title='Apparently Useless': The Accidental Discovery of LSD|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/the-accidental-discovery-of-lsd/379564/|publisher=The Atlantic|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics==
[[Charles Dalziel]] studied the effects of electricity on animals and humans, and wrote ''The Effects of Electric Shock on Man'', a book in which he explains the effects of different amounts of electricity on human subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dalziel, Charles F. |title=The effects of electric shock on man|publisher= Washington, D.C. : U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Office of Health and Safety Series: Safety and fire protection technical bulletin; no. 7|year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; He carried out experiments on human subjects, including himself. He also invented the [[ground-fault circuit interrupter]] or GFCI, based on his understanding of electric shock in humans.

In 1998 a British scientist, [[Kevin Warwick]], became the first human being to test an [[RFID]] as an implant to control surrounding technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9901/14/chipman.idg/|title= CNN story: Is human chip implant wave of the future? | date=1999-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 he went on to have an array of 100 electrodes fired into the [[median nerve]] of his left arm during a two-hour neurosurgical operation. With this implant in place, over a three-month period, he conducted a number of experiments, including the first direct electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, K, Gasson, M, Hutt, B, Goodhew, I, Kyberd, P, Schulzrinne, H and Wu, X: "Thought Communication and Control: A First Step using Radiotelegraphy", IEE Proceedings on Communications, 151(3), pp.185-189, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current practitioners of self experimentation==

The 21st century has seen a revival of self-experimentation. With the late [[Seth Roberts]] having a popular blog with many interesting findings of himself and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://archives.sethroberts.net/blog/ | date= 13 Jan 2016 | title=Personal Science, Self-Experimentation, Scientific Method | author=Seth Roberts }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bestselling author [[Tim Ferriss]] claims to be a self-experimenter to the extreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= The Value of Self-Experimentation | author=Tim Ferriss | url=https://tim.blog/2010/12/18/the-value-of-self-experimentation-plus-extreme-videos-do-not-try-this-at-home/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Quantified Self]] community has many members that do many kinds of experiments and meet-ups to report about them, along with yearly conferences discussing findings, methods and other aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://quantifiedself.com/about/ | title=Quantified Self |access-date=20 Jul 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Alexander Shulgin]] devoted his entire career to self experimentation, publishing his results in the widely acclaimed books [[PiHKAL]] and [[TiHKAL]]. Dr. Zee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dr Zee Home Page |url=https://www.drzee.org |website=Dr Zee |publisher=Dr Zee |accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a self-proclaimed Neo-Shulginist, is also known for a career of self experimentation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Jonze |first1=Tim |title=Dr Zee, the godfather of legal highs: I test everything on myself |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/24/dr-zee-the-godfather-of-legal-highs-i-test-everything-on-myself |accessdate=6 July 2018 |publisher=The Guardian |date=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==In fiction==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
Examples in classic fiction include the tales of ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''. In each case the scientist's unorthodox theories lead to permanent change and ultimately to self-destruction.

Self-experimentation is a common trait amongst [[mad scientist]]s and [[villain|evil genius]]es in more contemporary fiction and is part of the creation story of many [[comic book]] [[supervillain]]s, and some [[superhero]]es. For example, the [[Spider-Man]] villain [[Lizard (comics)|The Lizard]] lost his arm in a war (other versions vary), and experimented with reptilian DNA to try to grow it back; however, the therapy caused him to mutate into a half-human-half-reptile creature. The [[Fantastic Four]] were created when the Four were testing Reed Richards's new prototype rocket and were exposed to cosmic rays, giving them super powers. Other cases include the [[Man-Bat]], the [[Ultra-Humanite]], the [[Green Goblin]], and the [[Justice League (animated series)|animated Justice League]] version of [[Cheetah (comics)#Other media|Cheetah]].

The deepest example for self-experimentation was shown in [[Ang Lee]]'s ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' (2003), where [[Brian Banner|David Banner]] experimented on himself to improve on his own limits, which is also why [[The Incredible Hulk|his son]] had many different abilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1290">In [[computer science]], a '''sequential algorithm''' or '''serial algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] that is executed sequentially – once through, from start to finish, without other processing executing – as opposed to [[concurrent computing|concurrently]] or in [[parallel computing|parallel]]. The term is primarily used to contrast with ''[[concurrent algorithm]]'' or ''[[parallel algorithm]];'' most standard computer algorithms are sequential algorithms, and not specifically identified as such, as sequentialness is a background assumption. Concurrency and parallelism are in general distinct concepts, but they often overlap – many [[distributed algorithm]]s are both concurrent and parallel – and thus "sequential" is used to contrast with both, without distinguishing which one. If these need to be distinguished, the opposing pairs sequential/concurrent and serial/parallel may be used.

"Sequential algorithm" may also refer specifically to an algorithm for decoding a [[convolutional code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O11-sequentialalgorithm.html|title=A Dictionary of Computing at Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17147">'''Taxation of the Jews in Europe''' refers to taxes imposed specifically on [[Jewish]] people in [[Europe]], in addition to the taxes levied on the general population.  Special taxation imposed on the Jews by the state or ruler of the territory in which they were living has played an important part in Jewish history.&lt;ref name="Judaica"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/ancienttaxation.html Taxation. Encyclopaedia Judaica.] Reproduced by Jewish Virtual Library.&lt;/ref&gt; The abolition of special taxes on the Jews followed their admission to civil rights in France and elsewhere in Europe at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Judaica"/&gt;

== In the Roman Empire ==
The [[Fiscus Judaicus]] ([[Latin]]: "Jewish tax") or "Temple Tax" was a [[tax]] collecting agency instituted to collect the tax imposed on [[Jewish diaspora#Post-Roman Diaspora|Jews]] in the [[Roman Empire]] after the destruction of the [[Second Temple|Temple of Jerusalem]] in 70 CE in favor of the temple of [[Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus|Jupiter Capitolinus]] in [[Ancient Rome|Rome]].

The tax was initially imposed by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Vespasian]] as one of the [[Anti-Judaism|measures against Jews]] as a result of the [[First Roman-Jewish War]] of 66–73 CE.  Vespasian imposed the tax in the aftermath of the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish revolt]] (Josephus ''BJ'' 7. 218; Dio Cassius 65.7.2). The tax was imposed on all Jews throughout the empire, not just on those who took part in the revolt against Rome. The tax was imposed after the [[destruction of the Second Temple]] in 70 CE in place of the levy (or [[Tithe]]) payable by Jews towards the upkeep of the Temple. The amount levied was two [[denarius|denarii]], equivalent to the one-half of a [[shekel]] that observant Jews had previously paid for the upkeep of the Temple of Jerusalem ({{bibleverse||Exodus|30:13|HE}}). The tax was to go instead to the [[Temple of Capitoline Jupiter]], the major center of [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]]. The ''fiscus Iudaicus'' was a humiliation for the Jews.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In Rome, a special [[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] known as ''procurator ad capitularia Iudaeorum'' was responsible for the collection of the tax.&lt;ref name="Fiscus"&gt;"Fiscus Judaicus", ''Encyclopedia Judaica''&lt;/ref&gt; Only those who had abandoned Judaism were exempt from paying it.

== In the Holy Roman Empire ==
The Jewish populations of Europe were politically insecure and could be easily exploited for the levying of heavy taxes in exchange for official protection. The high interest rates charged by Jews became an illimitable source of tax revenue and Jewish wealth was technically easy to gauge because Jews typically stored their assets in the form of cash or promissory notes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eberhard Isenmann|editor=Richard Bonney|title=The Rise of the Fiscal State in Europe c.1200-1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U24lRLy_qT8C&amp;pg=PA259|date=2 September 1999|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-154220-6|pages=259–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Imperial Tax Register of 1241 was the first register to include taxes on the Jews. The total of the taxes on the Jews listed in the Register amounted to 857 silver marks; the total contribution of all the cities together amounted to 4.290 silver marks. These local taxes served wholly or in part to finance town-building. Not all of the contributions reached the central administration. In contrast, it is clear from the Register that the payments made by the Jews reached the Exchequer in their entirety.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 13&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt; The taxes on the Jews were first described as the ’’Jewish Tax’’ in 1330.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 18&amp;ndash;19&lt;/ref&gt;

The Opferfennig (originally Guldenpfennig) tax was introduced in 1342 by Emperor [[Louis IV the Bavarian]], who ordered all Jews above the age of 12 and possessing 20 gulden to pay one gulden annually for protection. This taxation was 1 florin for every Jew and included assets worth more than 20 florins. Widows were not exempted. King Wenceslas removed the taxable minimum but an exemption for Jews dependent on alms was made later by Sigsmund, who himself levied heavy taxation. Sigsmund taxed a third of the value of Jewish properties. It was represented as a coronation tax as part of Sigsmund's attempts to ascend the throne.  Isenmann disagrees and believes it was an innovation sprouted by Archchamberlain Konrad von Weinsberg. By 1433-4 the tax collectors were collecting tax worth a half of Jewish properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eberhard Isenmann|editor=Richard Bonney|title=The Rise of the Fiscal State in Europe c.1200-1815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U24lRLy_qT8C&amp;pg=PA259|date=2 September 1999|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=978-0-19-154220-6|pages=259–}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] later ordered the income of the Opferfennig tax to be delivered to the archbishop of [[Triers]]. This tax was at some places replaced by an overall communal tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_15120.html OPFERPFENNIG. Encyclopaedia Judaica]. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Leibzoll ==

The ''[[Leibzoll]]'' or ''Judengeleit'' was a special [[tariff|toll]] which Jews had to pay in most of the European states in the [[Middle Ages]] and up to the beginning of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Isidore Singer, Cyrus Adler | title=The Jewish Encyclopedia, Vol. 7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SzsyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA669| year=1906| publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company|page=669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Hungary ==
[[Tolerance tax]] (Toleranzgebührer) was a [[tax]] that was levied against [[Jews]] of [[Hungary]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]], beginning in 1747.&lt;ref name="jg"&gt;JewishGen. Hungary: Assorted Census Records, 1781-1850 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tax was based on the German statute that a Jew was obliged to pay a certain tax to be "tolerated".&lt;ref&gt;Wine and thorns in Tokay Valley: Jewish life in Hungary : the history of Abaújszántó, by Zahava Szász Stessel, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1995, p. 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Poland ==

=== Koło ===
In 1571 a contract was drafted with regard to the status of the Jews in [[Koło]], in which the city's Christians have undertaken to provide protection to the Jews, in return for which the Jews were required to pay a special annual municipal tax.&lt;ref name="mahler"&gt;Mahler, Rafael. [http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/kolo/kol008.html "From the near and far past".  Some information about the history of the Jews of Koło.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1729 the Jewish community was required to pay 150 gold coins as an annual poll tax, and in 1738 this sum was increased to 300 gold coins.&lt;ref name="mahler"/&gt;

In 1775 the Polish parliament imposed a special duty on books written in [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]], requiring each book to be stamped by the municipality. Despite heavy penalties imposed on owners of unstamped books, many books were concealed and unstamped.&lt;ref name="mahler"/&gt;

== In Russia ==
The Russian [[Kosher tax]], known as the ''korobka'', was a tax paid only by Jews for each animal slaughtered in accordance with the [[kashrut]] rules and for each pound of this meat sold.&lt;ref name="ji"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shtetlinks.jewishgen.org/kraziai/history_tax_on_jews.htm Korobka Tax on Kraziai's Jews], Document 49-1-1362 from the Kaunas Archive&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of the Russian Jewish "basket tax" or "box tax". Though it was used to refer to a tax on meat or slaughtering, the word ''korobka'' (Russian: коробка) actually means "box" in Russian. The tax came to be called that because Jews paying had to deposit a coin in a box at the kosher slaughterer.&lt;ref name=Diner2001p164&gt;[[Hasia R. Diner|Diner, Hasia R.]] ''Hungering for America: Italian, Irish, and Jewish Foodways in the Age of Migration'', [[Harvard University Press]], 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-674-00605-8}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zU1WYFWxn74C&amp;pg=PA164 p.&amp;nbsp;164.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Herman Rosenthal]] and [[Jacob Goodale Lipman]], the tax was "the most burdensome and annoying of the special taxes imposed upon the Jews of Russia by the government".&lt;ref name="ji"&gt;[[Herman Rosenthal|Rosenthal, Herman]]; [[Jacob Goodale Lipman|Lipman, J.G.]] [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=394&amp;letter=B "Basket-Tax"], ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Belovinskiĭ2003p357"&gt;Leonid Vasilʹevich Belovinskiĭ.

==In Galicia==
Between 1777 and 1784, the Jews of [[Horodenka]], a region on the southeast corner of [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]], paid a number of special taxes, including the "protection and [[tolerance tax]]", and the "property and occupation tax". In 1784, the property and occupation tax was replaced with the kosher meat tax.&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, N. M. ''The History of the Jews of Horodenka'', p.&amp;nbsp;86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Moldavia==
In 1741, Moldavian prince [[Grigore II Ghica|Grigore Ghica]] confirmed the obligation of each Jew to pay the crupca, an indirect tax on kosher meat similar to the Russian ''korobka''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/printarticle.aspx?id=925 Iaşi, by Lucian-Zeev Herşcovici ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Altona and Hamburg ==
During the period 1641&amp;ndash;1842, the [[Jews]] of [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] (then a town close to Hamburg) paid specifically Jewish taxes as well as the same taxes as other residents of Altona. The tax burden on the members of the Jewish community was twice as heavy as that on the other residents.

In 1640 the Danish King [[Christian IV]] acquired part of the [[Holstein-Pinneberg|County of Pinneberg]] including Altona.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 25&amp;ndash;26&lt;/ref&gt; Altona was subsequently granted the rights and status of a town on 23 August 1664.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 53&amp;ndash;54&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jews in Hamburg ===

The community was founded principally by Portuguese merchants and was known as the [[Portuguese Jewish community in Hamburg|Portuguese-Jewish Community]], although many of its members were of Spanish-Jewish descent. 

These [[Sephardic Jews]], who initially pretended to be persecuted [[Catholic]]s, first came to [[Hamburg]] at the end of the 16th century. They were mostly Portuguese- or Spanish-speaking merchants. In 1621, when the armistice between [[Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]] came to an end, many of the Portuguese Jews moved to Hamburg. They were made welcome, even after the actual situation had become clear; however they were not permitted to establish a cemetery within the city walls. Thanks to the linguistic skills of the Sephardim and their contacts among their co-religionaries they controlled a large sector of the German market in provisions. The Sephardim differed culturally and socially from the Jews who came to Altona, and subsequently also to Hamburg, from the east. These were [[Yiddish Language]] speaking [[Ashkenazim]].
The permanent settlement of the Ashkenazim was opposed by both the [[Senate of Hamburg]] (town council) and the citizens, supported by the Sephardim, who did not wish to see the establishment of a second community in Hamburg. As servants, referred to as tudescos, the Ashkenazi Jews were, de facto, under the protection of the Sephardic Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 91&amp;ndash;94&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jews in Altona ===

On 1 August 1641 the Danish king had formally granted the Ashkenazi Jews the privilege of having in Altona, as hitherto, a cemetery and a synagogue, thus providing the basis for the existence of a Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, the Danish kings promised the Jews personal security, the freedom to practice trade and religious liberties. Some of the Jews living in Hamburg therefore tried  to secure the legal protection of the Danish crown in case of any attempt to expel them. In Altona the conditions of residence were favorable, in Hamburg the conditions for trading. These were the reasons for the genesis of the Altona community of Ashkenazi Jews from Hamburg and Altona.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; Thanks to immigration from the east, Altona became a center of research and scholarship in Jewish teaching, attracting hundreds of students. The officially recognized [[Beth din|Jewish court of justice]] had a reputation as one of the most distinguished in the whole Jewish world.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 243&amp;ndash;244&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews did not acquire these privileges freely, but in return for the payment of taxes.

=== Levies on Jews ===

From 1584 to 1639, as in the Middle Ages, the Jews of Altona paid taxes specific to the Jews, but no further taxes. Each Jewish family was required to pay 6 [[rixdollar|Reichstaler]] per year. Under Danish rule this changed: the Jews continued to pay the specifically Jewish taxes plus the same taxes as all other residents.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; From 1641 every Jewish family was required to pay 5 Reichstaler in Jewish taxes; in the year when Altona became a town the contribution rose to 6 Reichstaler.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 135, pp. 180&amp;ndash;181&lt;/ref&gt; With the ordinance of 1641 the Danish king had permitted the Jews [[shechita]]. This privilege too was not cost-free. For the years 1667&amp;ndash;1669 we have records of taxes paid by Jewish butchers. According to these the rates were 1 Mark and 8 Schillinge for an ox, 4 Schillinge for a calf and 2 Schillinge for a lamb. These taxes were twice as high as those paid by Christian butchers.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 153, pp. 168&amp;ndash;169&lt;/ref&gt; From 1681 Individual taxes on the Jews (6 Reichstaler plus the payments made by the Jewish butchers), were replaced by lump-sum payments by the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; 

From the year 1712 onwards it is possible to calculate the amount of the lump-sum payments made by the Jews. During the period 1712&amp;ndash;1818 this amounted to 6 Reichstaler for each Jewish family; 6 Reichstaler was the level that had already been set in 1584. Assuming that a Jewish family consisted of approximately 6 persons, 6 Reichstaler corresponded to 1 Reichstaler for each individual Jew. On top of this 1 Reichstaler, also paid by the other residents, had to be paid.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, pp. 265-266. Meaningful conversion of the face-value can be made for this period since, unlike the paper money of Copenhagen, the silver currency of Altona was stable, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; The tax burden on the members of the Jewish community was twice as heavy as that on the other residents. The influence of this on business practice constituted an obstacle to the granting of civil rights. In the year 1818 the Jewish Elders declared to the community of Altona that they could not, ’’on the one hand, levy specifically Jewish taxes on the members of their community and, on the other hand, encourage our co-religionaries, especially the younger ones, to pursue useful activity. In short: so to improve our condition that we might not seem unworthy to acquire civil rights. The extension – against our wishes - of the taxes on the Jews would be incompatible with the granting of civil rights.’’&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the beginning of the struggle of the Jewish community for emancipation. The Jewish community secured the abolition of taxes on the Jews in the year 1842.&lt;ref&gt;Judenschutzsteuern, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14419">'''The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale (PIWBS)''' is a [[self-report inventory]] with a [[Likert scale]] format, designed to assess five distinct dimensions of [[Personal identity|identity]] and [[subjective well-being]] among Pacific populations in [[New Zealand]]:
# Group Membership Evaluation
# Pacific Connectedness and Belonging
# Religious Centrality and Embeddedness
# Perceived Familial Wellbeing
# Perceived Societal Wellbeing

The PIWBS was developed by Sam Manuela, a doctoral candidate at [[The University of Auckland]].&lt;ref&gt;Manuela, S. (2010). The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale. Published master’s thesis. The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manuela, S. &amp; Sibley, C. G. (2012). The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale (PIWBS): A Culturally-Appropriate Self Report Measure for Pacific Peoples in New Zealand. Social Indicators Research, 1, 83-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manuela, S. &amp; Sibley, C. G (2012). Why Do Pacific People with Multiple Ethnic Affiliations Have Poorer Subjective Wellbeing? Negative Ingroup Affect Mediates the Identity Tension Effect. Social Indicators Research, 1, 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The scale aims to provide a culturally sensitive, valid and reliable [[self-report inventory]] of Pacific identity and [[subjective well-being]] which aids the understanding and predicting of Pacific outcomes. The measure contributes to Pacific studies by providing a [[quantitative research|quantitative]], within-cultural research tool for Pacific peoples from a Pacific perspective. The PIWBS is associated with the [[New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study]].

The dimensions, Group Membership Evaluation, Pacific Connectedness and Belonging, and Religious Centrality and Embeddness all relate to identity. Answers to questions relating to identity are rated on a [[Likert scale]] ranging from 1 to 7 (1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree). The dimensions, Perceived Familial Wellbeing and Perceived Societal Wellbeing both relate to wellbeing. Answers to questions relating to [[wellbeing]] are rated on a [[Likert scale]] ranging from 1 to 7 (1 = completely dissatisfied and 7 = completely satisfied).

==The Five Dimensions==

===1. Group Membership Evaluation (GME)===

This factor reflects subjective evaluations of membership within the Pacific group. Positive group evaluations are shown through pride in one's [[ethnic identity]] and [[culture]],&lt;ref&gt;Mila-Schaaf, K., Robinson, E., Schaaf, D., Denny, S., &amp; Watson, P. D. (2008). A health profile of Pacific youth: Findings of youth 2000. A National Secondary School Youth Health Survey. Auckland: University of Auckland.&lt;/ref&gt; and represent a secure ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;Anae, M. (1998). Fofoa-i-vao-’ese: The identity journeys of NZ-born Samoans. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt; This factor includes an evaluation of positive effect brought about by Pacific group membership, and an evaluation of the extent to which one's Pacific identity is seen as a central and defining aspect of [[self-concept]]. High scores on this factor would indicate that positive/worthwhile feelings are derived from Pacific identification, and that affiliation with a Pacific group is seen as a desirable aspect of self-concept and is central to identity.

====Sample Group Membership Evaluation Items====

* The fact that I am an Islander is an important part of my identity
* Being an Islander is an important part of how I see myself
* I am glad to be a Pacific Islander
* I am proud to be a Pacific Islander
* Being a Pacific Islander gives me a good feeling

====2. Pacific Connectedness and Belonging (PCB)====
This factor is a measure of an individual's sense of [[belongingness|belonging]] and connectedness with Pacific others and groups. These feelings derive from shared experiences and commonalities and are particularly apparent among youth,.&lt;ref&gt;Macpherson, C. (1996). Pacific Islands identity and community. In P. Spoonley, D. Pearson, &amp; C. Macpherson (Eds.), Nga Patai: Racism and ethnic relations in Aotearoa/New Zealand (pp. 124–143). Palmerston North, NZ: Dunmore Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anae, M. (1998). Fofoa-i-vao-’ese: The identity journeys of NZ-born Samoans. Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiatia, J. (1998). Caught between cultures: A New Zealand-born Pacific Island perspective. Auckland: Christian Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt; This factor, which assesses the extent to which the individual believes the self to be an integral part of a Pacific group, is made up of two distinct dimensions. The first dimension concerns perceived connections/relationships with others, and the second dimension concerns an individual's subjective sense of belonging at a broader level. High scores on this factor would indicate that the individual feels similar to Pacific others, and perceives themselves to be an integral member of the wider, general group, and have a feeling of belonging.

=====Sample Pacific Connectedness and Belonging Items=====
* I feel at home around other Islanders, even if they are not from my Island
* I feel comfortable in places with lots of other Pacific peoples
* I don’t get along with other island groups (reverse coded)
* I feel connected to other Pacific peoples in general
* I feel connected to people from a different Pacific Island to myself
* I feel most comfortable in Pacific communities

====3. Religious Centrality and Embeddedness (RCE)====
This factor assesses the individual's evaluation of the extent to which [[religion]] is central to their identity as Pacific, and the extent to which they believe religion to be entwined with Pacific [[culture]]. [[Religion]] is an important aspect of Pacific identity, having a huge influence on many Pacific communities by providing social connections and support, and fulfilling cultural and religious needs.&lt;ref&gt;Anae, M. (2001). The New Vikings of the sunrise: New Zealand-born in the information age. In P. Spoonley, C. Macpherson, &amp; M. Anae (Eds.), Tagata o te Moana Nui: The evolving identities of Pacific peoples in Aotearoa, New Zealand (pp. 89–101). Palmerston North, NZ: Dunmore Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tiatia, J. (1998). Caught between cultures: A New Zealand-born Pacific Island perspective. Ellerslie, Auckland: Christian Research Association.&lt;/ref&gt; This factor focuses on [[Christianity]]-based religions which are the most common in Pacific societies. High scores on this factor would indicate that the individual feels that [[Christianity]]-based religion is a central aspect of self-identity, and is strongly linked to their Pacific [[culture]].

=====Sample Religious Centrality and Embeddedness Items=====
* Going to Church is part of my culture and religion
* God has a strong connection to my culture
* Religion is not important for my culture (reverse coded)
* Part of being a Pacific Islander is having a connection with God
* Religion is the root of our Pasifika culture
* Our religion is the centre of our culture as Pacific Islanders

====4. Perceived Familial Wellbeing (PFW)====
This factor assesses the individual's subjective satisfaction with their family, and the [[subjective well-being]] of and within their family. Family offers [[Human body|physical]], mental, [[cultural]], [[spirituality|spiritual]] and [[social]] nurturance, and is an integral aspect of Pacific [[self-concept]], closely tied to wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;Tamasese, K., Peteru, C., &amp; Waldegrave, C. (1997). O le Taeo Afua—The new morning: A qualitative investigation into Samoan perspectives on mental health and culturally appropriate services. Wellington: The Family Centre &amp; NZ Health Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; This factor assesses a variety of Pacific family values including [[respect]], [[communication]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]] and [[happiness]]. High scores in this factor would indicate that the individual feels a strong sense of [[social support|support]] from their family, and that the individual perceives their family as a whole to have a high level of wellbeing.

=====Sample Perceived Familial Wellbeing Items=====
* Your relationship with your parents
* Your family's security
* The respect you give for your parents
* The respect you receive from your family
* Your position in your family
* Your family's happiness
* Communication with your family

====5. Perceived Societal Wellbeing (PSW)====
This factor reflects the individual's [[Contentment|satisfaction]] with [[society]] and the [[social support|support]] it offers. Satisfaction with society has a strong influence on the subjective wellbeing of Pacific people.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Health. (1995). Pacific Islands peoples’ understanding of mental health. Strategic directions for the mental health services for Pacific Islands people. Wellington: Ministry of Health.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kupa, K. (2009). Te Vaka Atafaga: a Tokelau assessment model for supporting holistic mental health practice with Tokelau people in Aotearoa, New Zealand. Pacific Health Dialog, 15, 156–163.&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived support from society is assessed on various levels, from the local community level to the national government level and responses indicate how supported and integrated the Pacific individual feels in New Zealand. High scores on this factor would indicate that the individual feels satisfied, supported and accepted by all levels of New Zealand society.

=====Sample Perceived Societal Wellbeing Items=====
* Support provided to you by the New Zealand government to you as a Pacific Islander
* Your position in New Zealand as a Pacific person
* Your personal needs being met by New Zealand
* The support you receive as a Pacific Islander in the community you live in
* Your relationship with New Zealand society
* The support you receive in the community you live in
* The support you receive as a Pacific Islander in New Zealand

==Validation of the PIWBS==

The Pacific Identity and Wellbeing Scale was developed and validated using [[exploratory factor analysis]] (EFA) and [[confirmatory factor analysis]] (CFA).  The initial pool of 125 questions was developed based on previous Pacific research, a variety of other wellbeing and identity scales, discussions with Pacific peoples and the [[Multi-dimensional Model of Maori Identity and Cultural Engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;Houkamau, C. A., &amp; Sibley, C. G. (2010). The multi-dimensional model of Maori identity and cultural engagement. New Zealand Journal of Psychology, 39, 8–25.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Exploratory factor analysis]] (EFA) was conducted to organise the 125 possible questions into groups (factors) based on similarity of topic. Individual items that did not fit a group well or that related to more than one group were not used. Thirty-one questions were retained which were found to measure the five distinct, yet interconnected factors of Pacific identity and wellbeing. [[Confirmatory factor analysis]] (CFA) was later used to confirm the structure of the PIWBS. All 31 items were found to be strongly related to the predicted factors. 
[[Cronbach's alpha]] (internal reliability) measures the extent to which all the questions in a section measure the same construct/factor consistently. The five factors of the PIWBS showed excellent internal reliability, with [[Cronbach's alpha]]s all above α = 0.85. The minimum accepted standard of internal reliability is α = 0.70. 

The PIWBS has been used in several studies to investigate the low levels of [[subjective well-being]] found among Pacific peoples who identify with multiple [[ethnic group]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Manuela, S. &amp; Sibley, C. G (2012). Why Do Pacific People with Multiple Ethnic Affiliations Have Poorer Subjective Wellbeing? Negative Ingroup Affect Mediates the Identity Tension Effect. Social Indicators Research, 1, 1-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Differences were found in levels of [[subjective well-being]] depending on the number of ethnic groups the individual associated with. For example, people who identified only as Pacific had higher levels of wellbeing than people who identified as both Pacific and non-Pacific (e.g. New Zealand European). However, there were no differences in wellbeing levels between people who identified as only Pacific, and people who identified with two Pacific groups (e.g. [[Tongans|Tongan]] and [[Samoans|Samoan]]). This suggests that lower wellbeing only occurred when the two [[ethnic group]]s associated with, were very different (e.g. Pacific and New Zealand European).

Identity Tension Effect: Associating with both a Pacific group and a majority ethnic group (e.g. [[New Zealand European]]) may lead to negative feelings about Pacific aspects of [[Personal identity|identity]]. This is because people who identify with multiple [[ethnic group]]s tend to be more likely to [[internalise]] negative [[stereotypes]] about Pacific people held by the majority. This can lead to identity confusion and lowered [[self-esteem]]. 

[[Population projection]]s suggest that the Pacific community will grow by 60% by 2026.&lt;ref&gt;Ministry of Social Development. (2008). Diverse communities: Exploring the refugee and migrant experience in New Zealand. Wellington, NZ: Ministry of Social Development.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately one third of Pacific people identify as both Pacific and non-Pacific. This means that a growing percentage of the New Zealand population may be at risk of a number of negative outcomes. These outcomes include both lower [[self-esteem]], as well as decreased feelings of support from family. Through applied research interventions such as challenging negative [[stereotype]]s and promoting positive [[stereotype]]s about Pacific peoples, it may be possible to address this problem.

'''Thomas Titus Nkobi''' (born 22 October 1922 in Southern [[Matabeleland]], died 25 September 1994 in [[Johannesburg]] / South Africa) was a senior leader of the South African [[African National Congress|African National Congress (ANC)]] and a key figure in the [[apartheid|Anti-Apartheid]] movement. Until his death he was the Treasurer General of the ANC and also its Member of Parliament.

==Life==
Thomas Titus Nkobi ("Comrade T.G.") was born on 22 October 1922 in [[Plumtree, Zimbabwe|Plumtree]], [[Matabeleland South]], [[Southern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zimbabwe]]). He grew up and was educated in South Africa, where his father was working in the mines as a migrant labourer. He was at [[Adams College]] of Education in [[KwaZulu Natal]] with [[Joshua Nkomo]], the Zimbabwean Vice-President and [[Bernard Chidzero]], the Zimbabwean Minister of Finance and Dr. [[Ntsu Mokhehle]], the Prime Minister of [[Lesotho]]. After completing High School in Natal he matriculated from Bantu High School (later Madibane High School) in Western Township, Johannesburg in 1946 and went to [[National University of Lesotho|Roma College (now National University of Lesotho)]] in Lesotho, pursuing a [[Bachelor of Commerce]] degree.

His initial political involvement against the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|Apartheid regime]] started in 1944 during the [[Alexandra, Gauteng|Alexandra]] bus boycott, a non-violent protest campaign. In 1950 he formally joined the [[African National Congress|ANC]] and played a leading role in the 1952 ANC [[Defiance Campaign|Defiance Campaign against Unjust Laws]]. He was one of the main volunteers who travelled from village to village collecting demands of the African population that were incorporated into the ANC [[Freedom Charter]]; he attended the 1955 [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]] in [[Kliptown]] that drew up the Freedom Charter as a delegate from Alexandra.

In 1957 Thomas Nkobi shot to prominence when he chaired the Second Alexandra Peoples Transport Committee which was co-ordinating a bus boycott in the Johannesburg and [[Pretoria]] [[Township (South Africa)|townships]] following a 25 per cent increase in bus fares. In the same year he was arrested for participating in the nationwide [[South African Potato Boycott]], following The Farm Labour Scandal, a journalistic investigation by [[Ruth First]] and [[Joe Gqabi]], which uncovered that Africans arrested for infringement of the [[pass laws]] were coerced into enforced labour on potato farms. In 1958 Thomas Nkobi became the National Organizer of the ANC and was charged with the task of implementing the M-Plan, an action plan, named after [[Nelson Mandela]], to decentralise the ANCs organizational branches and communication channels to avoid public meetings and announcements and increase effectiveness of their political and social campaign.

During the 1960 [[State of Emergency]], he was amongst the thousands of political activists who were detained. After his release he continued working for the ANC as National Organizer and was also prominent in the underground. He was [[banned]] in 1961, and in 1962 placed under a 24-hour house arrest. In 1963 Thomas Nkobi fled South Africa for exile in [[Dar es Salaam]] / [[Tanzania]] and later [[Lusaka]] / [[Zambia]], where he became actively involved in mobilising international public opinion against the Apartheid regime.

From 1968 to 1973 he served as deputy to then [[Treasurer|Treasurer General]] of the ANC, [[Moses Kotane]]. He was elected Treasurer General of the ANC in 1973, a post to which he was re-elected at all subsequent national conferences of the organisation.

After the ANC was in legalised in 1990 he returned to South Africa. There he oversaw the ANCs budget for South Africa's first democratic election, which brought the ANC to power. Thomas Nkobi was re-elected as Treasurer General in party elections in 1991 and also elected as Member of Parliament, member of the ANC National Executive Committee (NEC) and member of the ANC's National Working Committee (NWC); one of several elders with moderate views who retained leadership positions.

He died on 25 September 1994, in Johannesburg after suffering a fatal stroke. He is buried at Heroes' Acre in Soweto, a section of Soweto's [[Avalon Cemetery]] reserved as final resting place for many Anti-Apartheid activists.

In 2004, Thomas Nkobi posthumously received the [[Order of Luthuli| Order of Luthuli in Gold]] for his "exceptional and selfless contribution to the struggle for a non-racial, non-sexist, free and democratic South Africa".

[[image:Poids et mesures.png|200px|thumb|right|Woodcut dated 1800 illustrating the new decimal units which became the legal norm across all France on 4 November 1800]]

Before the [[French Revolution]], which started in 1789, [[units of measurement in France|French units of measurement]] were based on the [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] system, introduced by the first [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charlemagne]] {{nowrap|(800 – 814 AD)}} which in turn were based on ancient Roman measures. Charlemagne brought a consistent system of measures across the entire empire. However, after his death, the empire fragmented and many rulers introduced their own variants of the units of measure.

Some of Charlemagne's units of measure, such as the pied du Roi (the king's [[foot (unit)|foot]]) remained virtually unchanged for about a thousand years, while others, such as the ''aune'' ([[ell]]—used to measure cloth) and the ''livre'' ([[Pound (mass)|pound]]) varied dramatically from locality to locality. By the time of the revolution, the number of units of measure had grown to the extent that it was almost impossible to keep track of them.

== History ==
[[File:Pernes - Mesures anciennes.JPG|thumb|Table of the measuring units used in the 17th century at [[Pernes-les-Fontaines]] in the covered market at [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] [[Regions of France|region]] of southeastern [[France]]]]

Although in the pre-revolutionary era (before 1795) France used a system and units of measure that had many of the characteristics of contemporary [[English units]] (or the later [[Imperial System]] of units), France still lacked a unified, countrywide system of measurement. Whereas in England the [[Magna Carta]] decreed that "there shall be one unit of measure throughout the realm", Charlemagne and successive kings had tried but failed to impose a unified system of measurement in France.&lt;ref name=histmet&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.french-metrology.com/en/history/history-mesurement.asp
|title = History of measurement
|publisher = Métrologie française
|accessdate = 2011-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names and relationships of many units of measure were adopted from Roman units of measure and much more were added – it has been estimated that there were seven or eight hundred different names for the various units of measure. Moreover, the quantity associated with each unit of measure differed from town to town and even from trade to trade to the extent that the ''lieue'' (league) could vary from 3.268&amp;nbsp;km in [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] to 5.849&amp;nbsp;km in [[Provence]]. It has been estimated that on the eve of the Revolution a quarter of a million different units of measure were in use in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

As an example, the weights and measures used at [[Pernes-les-Fontaines]] in southeastern France differ from those cataloged later in this article as having been used in Paris. In many cases the names are different, while the ''livre'' is shown as being 403&amp;nbsp;g, as opposed to 489&amp;nbsp;g – the value of the ''livre du Roi''.

== Tables of units of measure ==

[[File:Tours pont Wilson repères hauteurs Loire.jpg|thumb|Flood levels at the ''pont Wilson'' at [[Tours]] in both metres and ''pied royal'']]

These definitions use the Paris definitions for the ''couture'' of Paris,&lt;ref&gt;See [[: far: Droit couturier en France]].&lt;/ref&gt; and definitions for other [[Ancien régime]] civil jurisdictions varied, at times quite significantly.

=== Length ===
The mediaeval royal units of length were based on the ''toise'' and in particular the ''toise de l'Écritoire'', the distance between the fingertips of the outstretched arms of a man which was introduced in 790&amp;nbsp;AD by [[Charlemagne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''toise'' had 6 ''pieds'' (feet) each of 326.6&amp;nbsp;mm (12.86&amp;nbsp;in). In 1668 the reference standard was found to have been deformed and it was replaced by the ''toise du Châtelet'' which, to accommodate the deformation of the earlier standard, was 11&amp;nbsp;mm (0.55%) shorter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Although the ''pouce'' ([[inch]]), ''pied'' ([[foot (unit)|foot]]) and ''toise'' ([[fathom]]) were fairly consistent throughout most of pre-revolutionary France, some areas had local variants of the ''toise''. Other units of measure such as the ''aune'' ([[ell]]), the ''perche'' ([[Perch (unit)|perch/rood]]), the ''[[arpent]]'' and the ''lieue'' ([[League (unit)|league]]) had a number of variations, particularly the ''aune'' (which was used to measure cloth&lt;ref name = VilleBeaune&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''loi du 19 frimaire an VIII'' (Law of 10 December 1799) states that one decimal metre is exactly 443.296 French [[Line (unit)|lines]], or ''3 pieds 11.296 lignes de la "Toise du Pérou"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate = 2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the French royal foot is exactly 9000/27,706 metres (about 0.3248&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref&gt;This can be shown by noting that 27706 x 16 = 443296 and that 9 x 16 = 144, the number of ''lignes'' in a ''pied''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Quebec]], the surveys in French units were converted using the relationship 1 ''pied'' (of the French variety, the same word being used for English feet as well) = 12.789 English [[inch]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/W-6 Weights and Measures Act, Schedule III]&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the Quebec ''pied'' very slightly smaller (about 4 parts in one million) than the ''pied'' used in France.

=== Mass ===

According to the law of 19 Frimaire An VIII (December 10, 1799),

* The kilogramme is equal to 18,827.15 grains. The kilogramme is, in addition, defined as the weight of 1&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;!--n.b. not litre--&gt; of distilled water at 4 degrees centigrade, i.e. at maximum density.&lt;ref name=Fevier&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.industrie.gouv.fr/metro/aquoisert/metre.htm
|title = Un historique du mètre
|language = French

|publisher = Ministère de l'Economie, des Finances et de l'Industrie
|accessdate = 2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the French pound (''livre'') was defined as the mass of exactly {{frac|70}} of a French cubic foot of water. When the kilogram was defined, the knowledge that a ''pied du Roi cube'' filled with water masses exactly 70 French pounds was apparently lost. According to the traditional (cubic foot) definition, one ''livre'' would have been about 489.675&amp;nbsp; grams. According to the kilogramme definition, one ''livre'' was about 489.506&amp;nbsp;grammes. The difference is about 0.035%. However, a small difference in salinity (i.e. the difference between distilled water and very good quality drinking water) is enough to explain this difference.

The units in the following table are (except for the talent) calculated based on the kilogram definition of the ''livre''.

==Early life==
Vang, an ethnic Hmong, was born on 8 December 1929,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=FB&amp;p_theme=fb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAE887C2383BF87&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Revered Hmong leader Vang Pao stands tall in two worlds...|date=1 January 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/08/world/asia/08vangpao.html|work=The New York Times|first=Douglas|last=Martin|title=Vang Pao, Laotian General Who Aided U.S., Dies at 81|date=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a Hmong village named [[Nong Het|Nonghet]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpt.org/hmong/bios.html Profile on] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218042220/http://www.wpt.org/hmong/bios.html |date=2011-02-18 }}, [[Wisconsin Public Television]]. Retrieved 19 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; located in Central [[Xiangkhuang Province]], in the northeastern region of [[Laos]], where his father, Neng Chu Vang, was a county leader.

Vang began his early life as a farmer until [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces invaded and occupied [[French Indochina]] in [[World War II]]. His father sent him away to school from the age of 10 to 15&lt;ref name="Stephen Magagnini"/&gt; before he launched his military career, joining the [[French Military]] to protect fellow Hmong during the Japanese invasion. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

While taking an entrance examination, the captain who was the proctor realized that Vang knew almost no written French. The captain dictated the answers to Vang so he could join the army. Vang insisted the captain gave him the answers but did not actually guide his hand on the paper. [[Anne Fadiman]], author of ''[[The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down]]'', said Vang did not express any embarrassment over this cheating. Fadiman added "it is worth noting that in this incident, far from tarnishing Vang Pao's reputation — as, for example [[Ted Kennedy]]'s fudged [[Spanish language|Spanish]] exam at [[Harvard University]] tarnished his — merely added to his mythology: this was the sort of man who could never be held back by such petty impediments as rules."&lt;ref name="Fadiman129"&gt;[[Anne Fadiman|Fadiman, Anne]].

==Military career==
{{details|topic=covert war in Laos|Laotian Civil War}}
The term "Mèo [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]]" was originally used by [[Free French]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[intelligence]] officers to describe the Hmong resistance forces working against the Japanese forces occupying [[Indochina]] and [[China]] during World War II. After World War II, French [[Groupement de Commandos Mixtes Aéroportés]] (GCMA) authorities recruited Vang as a lieutenant during the [[First Indochina War]] to combat the [[Viet Minh]] ({{YouTube|9n0Tc_9NN3A|archive video}} by Col. [[Jean Sassi]]).

He was the only ethnic Hmong to attain the rank of General officer in the [[Royal Lao Army]], and he was loyal to the [[King of Laos]] while remaining a champion of the [[Hmong people]]. During the 1960s/70s, he commanded the [[Laotian Civil War|Secret Army]], also known as the Hmong Army, a highly-effective [[Central Intelligence Agency]]-trained and supported force that fought against the [[Pathet Lao]] and [[People's Army of Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]'', "The Montagnard Moses", 15 January 2011, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Vang's ethnic Hmong and Laotian veterans and their refugee families who served in the U.S. "Secret Army" were eventually granted the status of political refugees by the [[United Nations]] because of persecution and genocide by the Lao [[Marxist]] government and [[communist]] Vietnam who took control in 1975. The Lao and Hmong refugees were allowed to resettle in the United States, France, [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and elsewhere. Many of Vang's former veterans formed the [[Lao Veterans of America]], Inc. and the Lao Veterans of America Institute, with offices in [[Fresno, California]], [[Washington, D.C.]] and other locales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laoveteransofamerica.org Lao Veterans of America, Inc.], retrieved 3 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Immigration to the United States==
Vang emigrated to the United States after the communists seized power in Laos in 1975. He and his wife, [[May Song Vang]], whom he married in 1973, initially moved first to [[Montana]] before settling in California.&lt;ref name=fbee&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=May Song Vang, widow of Gen.

Though he was somewhat less influential among younger Hmong-Americans who have grown up primarily in the United States, he generally was considered an influential leader of U.S.-based Hmong, enjoying great loyalty for his position of leadership and respect for his military accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Toni|last=Randolph|author2=Greta Cunningham |title=Hmong community reacts with alarm to charges against Vang Pao|date=5 June 2007|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/06/05/vangpao|publisher=[[Minnesota Public Radio]]|accessdate=10 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in exile, Vang assembled other Lao and Hmong leaders from around the world to create the [[United Lao National Liberation Front]] (ULNF), also known as the Lao National Liberation Movement or simply the [[Neo Hom]], to bring attention to atrocities happening in Laos and to support the political and military resistance to the government of the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Jane Hamilton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=dWIj5Q8l08wC&amp;pg=PA586&amp;dq=Tragic+mountains:+the+Hmong,+the+Americans,+and+the+secret+wars+for+Laos ''Tragic mountains: the Hmong, the Americans, and the secret wars for Laos'']&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=May 2017}} He was one of the eight founders of the organization in 1981, along with Prince [[Sisouk na Champassak]], General [[Phoumi Nosavan]] and General [[Kouprasith Abhay]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Thousands of Vang's former ethnic Laotian and Hmong veterans, and their refugee families, in the United States also formed the non-profit veterans and advocacy organizations the Lao Veterans of America and the Lao Veterans of America Institute. In the late 1980s and 1990s, Vang, aided by his adviser, Philip Smith, and influential American diplomatic allies, Members of Congress, and vast numbers of Hmong-Americans, helped halt the forced [[United Nations]]-sponsored repatriation back to Laos of thousands of Laotian and Hmong refugees in [[Thailand]]. It was a major human rights victory for the Hmong and Lao community and non-profit advocacy organizations who urged an end to forced repatriation, including the [[Center for Public Policy Analysis]] (CPPA) and the [[Lao Veterans of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Marc, Knight-Ridder / Tribune News Service (8 April 1996) "Hmong refugees will now be allowed to enter the U.S." http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18164641.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Washington, Wayne, Star Tribune (Minneapolis, Minnesota) (17 April 1996) "Agencies say influx of Hmong will go smoothly" http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62628182.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Capital Times (Madison, Wisconsin) "NEW WAVE OF LAOTIAN REFUGEES ON THE WAY HUNDREDS EXPECTED TO COME TO STATE" (18 April 1996) http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-69595349.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Ben, Washington Times (Washington, D.C.)

Throughout Vang's residence in the U.S., the Hmong leader diplomatically opposed human rights violations by the communist government of Laos against the Hmong and Laotian people. He was invited to speak at the U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos, with Members of Congress, about the persecution of the Laotian and Hmong people on several occasions in the U.S. Congress from 1999 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforpublicpolicyanalysis.org Center for Public Policy Analysis]; accessed 6 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993-2003, Vang relied on Philip Smith for much of his efforts with policymakers in Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Congress. Smith was a long-time friend of Vang Pao and many Laotian and Hmong American community leaders.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Sun'' (21 September 2009)"Vang Pao Escapes" http://www.nysun.com/editorials/vang-pao-escapes/86878&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scoop Independent News, Auckland, New Zealand (17 February 2011) "Vietnam, Laos Nationalist Fighter Honored By Lao Hmong" http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1102/S00609/vietnam-laos-nationalist-fighter-honored-by-lao-hmong.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, Smith was instrumental in helping Vang to meet with key Members of Congress and senior Administration officials as well as helping to organize Congressional hearings, briefings and research missions to South East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;''The Olympian'', McClatchy News (11 January 2011) [http://www.theolympian.com/2007/06/05/1502667/suspect-in-alleged-laos-plot-had.html "Suspect in alleged Laos plot had friends, influence on Capitol Hill"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press/''USA Today'' (17 July 2007) [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2007-07-17-1201509033_x.htm "Hmong supporters criticize indictments"]&lt;/ref&gt; (Smith, a foreign policy, human rights and legislative affairs specialist, serves as the Executive Director of the Center for Public Policy Analysis.)

In March 2011, following Vang Pao's death, Smith wrote an editorial critical of the decision to not allow him to be interred in [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. Smith persisted in his efforts and the CPPA, along with the Lao Veterans of America, helped organize national veterans ceremonies in May 2011 to officially honor Vang Pao at Arlington National Cemetery&lt;ref name="startribune.com"&gt;''Minneapolis Star Tribune'' (7 March 2011) [http://www.startribune.com/opinion/commentaries/117551498.html "Vang Pao burial decision is a disgrace"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Agence France Press'' (AFP)/''Asia One News'' (13 May 2011)&lt;br&gt;[http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/World/Story/A1Story20110513-278644.html "Vietnam vet to get US honors after burial snub"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late November 2003 and early 2004, Vang shocked many of his closest advisers and supporters, and began to mysteriously, and abruptly, reverse his previous position in opposition to U.S. economic sanctions against the communist government of Laos.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Tony and McEnroe, Paul (5 July 2005)"THE COVERT WARS OF VANG PAO; Ex-guerrilla's gamble for peace backfires; With his empire unraveling, Gen.

Many of Vang's former veterans and their families, whose relatives were still being persecuted and killed in Laos, opposed Vang's change of stance on the issue of Normalized Trade Relations (NTR), or Most Favored Nation Trade Status (MFN), with Laos. This included the Lao Veterans of America, the Center for Public Policy Analysis and others. Following Pao's meeting with communist generals and officials from Vietnam, Vang's so-called "New Doctrine" was widely opposed by many of his closest advisers, family, supporters, and former veterans, and many in the Lao and Hmong-American community.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Tony, Star Tribune (Minneapolis, Minnesota) (5 July 2005) "THE COVERT WARS OF VANG PAO; Ex-guerrilla's gamble for peace backfires; With his empire unraveling, Gen.

Thailand-based Laotian and Hmong refugees, many of whom had been living at formal and informal refugee camps including [[Wat Tham Krabok]], a [[Buddhist]] temple in Thailand, were afforded the right to avoid the forced return to Laos and instead over 15,000 were offered relocation rights and assistance to the U.S. in 2004-05.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centerforpublicpolicyanalysis.org Center for Public Policy Analysis (CPPA)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baird|first=Ian G.|title=The monks and the Hmong: The special relationship between the Chao Fa and the Tham Krabok Buddhist Temple in Saraburi Province, Thailand.

==Coup d'etat conspiracy==
{{Main|2007 Laotian coup d'état conspiracy allegation}}
On 4 June 2007, following a lengthy federal investigation labeled "Operation Tarnished Eagle", warrants were issued by U.S. federal courts ordering the arrest of Vang Pao and nine others for allegedly plotting to overthrow the Pathet Lao communist government of Laos, in violation of the federal [[Neutrality Act of 1794|Neutrality Acts]]. Following the issuance of the warrants, an estimated 250 federal agents representing numerous U.S. federal law enforcement and other agencies conducted simultaneous raids on homes, offices and other locations throughout central and southern [[California]], arresting Vang and nine other individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/LAW/06/04/laos.arrests/index.html "Ten Charged with Alleged Laos Plot"], CNN, 4 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The federal charges alleged that members of the group inspected weapons, including [[AK-47]]s, smoke grenades, and Stinger missiles, with the intent of purchasing them and smuggling them into Thailand, where they allegedly would be shipped to anti-Laotian governmental [[resistance movement]] forces inside Laos. The one non-Hmong person among the nine arrested, Harrison Jack, a 1968 [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] graduate and retired Army infantry officer, allegedly attempted to recruit [[Special Operations]] veterans to act as mercenaries in an invasion of Laos. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The Pathet Lao Marxist government Laos was engaged in serious human rights violations, including military attacks on civilians by the [[Lao People's Army]] in Laos in 2007 and prior, according to [[Amnesty International]], [[Human Rights Watch]], the Center for Public Policy Analysis, the Lao Veterans of America, the Lao Human Rights Council, headed by Dr. [[Vang Pobzeb]], Members of the [[United States Congress]] and others. [[Vietnam People's Army]] forces were also involved with military attacks on the Hmong people in Laos and illegal logging activities driving many Hmong from their mountain homelands.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Philip, Center for Public Policy Analysis, Washington, D.C.

On 15 June 2007, defendants were indicted by a grand jury and an 11th man was arrested in connection with the alleged plot. The defendants face possible life prison terms for violation of the U.S. Neutrality Act and various weapons charges. Vang and the other Hmong were initially denied bail by the California federal court, which cited each of them as a flight risk. Since the 4 June 2007 federal raid, the arrests became the subject of mounting criticism. His fellow friends, including Hmong, Mienh, Lao, Vietnamese, and Americans individuals who knew Vang protested the arrests, rallying in California, Minnesota, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin. Several of Vang's high-level U.S. supporters criticized the California court that issued the arrest warrants. In 2009 all of the federal charges against Vang Pao were dropped.&lt;ref name="20090919-nytimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/19/us/19general.html U.S. Drops Case Against Exiled Hmong Leader", ''The New York Times'', 18 September 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to his arrest, Vang was scheduled to have an elementary school in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] named after him, a proposal that met with opposition over controversial academic [[Alfred W.

===Release from jail===
On 12 July 2007, under significant pressure from Vang's Hmong and influential American supporters, the California federal court ordered the release of the Hmong leader on a US$1.5 million bond secured by property owned by members of his family. Many Hmong had participated in numerous protests over several weeks in California and elsewhere, calling for Pao's release from the date of his incarceration until his release under bail nearly a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2007/07/13/vangpaoreleased|title=Pao released on bail|publisher=Minnesota.publicradio.org|date=13 July 2007|accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to court===
On 9 March 2009, Vang's lawyers filed a motion seeking to dismiss the charges against him. His lawyers claimed that the charges were fabricated and had no bearing in court. Following this appearance, on 6 April 2009, federal prosecutors denied all allegations of fabrications in the motion. That following month, on 11 May 2009, Vang Pao returned to federal court in [[Sacramento, California]] with his lawyers to argue the motion. Judge Frank Damrell stated, after hearing the arguments for the motion, that there was insufficient evidence from the defense to justify a dismissal. {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===Dropping of charges ===
On 18 September 2009, the federal government dropped all charges against Vang Pao, announcing in a release that the federal government was permitted to consider "the probable sentence or other consequences if the person is convicted."&lt;ref name="20090919-nytimes"/&gt; Vang Pao's long-time adviser and friend Philip Smith hailed the federal government's decision to drop the charges against Vang and the other accused Hmong-American defendants. Following Vang's arrest, Smith advocated in Washington, D.C. for the case to be dropped against Vang and other Hmong leaders. Smith raised repeated public concerns that the U.S. Justice Department and U.S. Department of States, would be putting themselves and the U.S. government on trial, for its betrayal and abandonment of the Hmong people during the conclusion of the Vietnam War and its aftermath when many Hmong were killed or imprisoned by the Lao communist government that prevailed in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'' (19 September 2009) [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/19/local/me-vang-pao19/2 "Federal charges dropped against Hmong leader Vang Pao: The exiled general was accused of plotting to overthrow the communist regime in Laos"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press/''USA TODAY'' (17 July 2007) [http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2007-07-17-1201509033_x.htm "Hmong supporters criticize indictments"]&lt;/ref&gt;

At special sessions of the U.S. Congressional Forum on Laos, Smith and the Center for Public Policy Analysis joined by Members of Congress, including U.S. Representative [[Dana Rohrabacher]], and others, called on the U.S. Department of Justice to immediately drop the case, and the charges, against General Vang and the other Hmong defendants, especially in light of the Lao government's and Lao Peoples Army's (LPA) ongoing military attacks and egregious human rights violations directed against many of the Laotian and Hmong people, which included attacks on unarmed civilians and political and religious dissidents, atrocities, rape, torture and the use of mass starvation.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Congressional Record, US GPO    (27 October 2000) [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2000-10-28/html/CREC-2000-10-28-pt1-PgE2004-3.htm "IMPORTANCE OF THE ONGOING U.S. CONGRESSIONAL FORUM ON LAOS..."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica (1 January 2001) [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/713517/Laos-Year-In-Review-2000 "Laos: Year in Review-2000"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Congressional Record, U.S. Government Printing Office (24 October 2002) [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2002-10-24/html/CREC-2002-10-24-pt1-PgE1958-2.htm "Statement of the Honorable Patrick Kennedy: US Congressional Forum on Laos"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amnesty International, (6 May 2006) [https://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/527 "Laos: Massacre of unarmed Hmong women and children"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407230759/http://www.amnesty.org.au/news/comments/527/ |date=2016-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Front Page Magazine'' (28 February 2008) [http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=30050 "The Two Faces of Communist Laos"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, following Vang's death, the CPPA issued an editorial, published in the ''Minneapolis Star Tribune'', critical of the decision by the U.S. Secretary of the Army not permitting Vang's burial in Arlington National Cemetery.&lt;ref name="startribune.com"/&gt; Despite the U.S. Secretary of the Army's unpopular and widely criticized decision, the CPPA, along with the Lao Veterans of America Institute, [[Lao Veterans of America]], Inc.

In May 2011, Vang's efforts during the Vietnam War were officially commemorated at memorial ceremonies in Arlington National Cemetery organized by the Lao Veterans of America Institute, LVA, the CPPA, the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Special Forces Association, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Agence France Press/''Asia One News'' (13 May 2011) "Vietnam vet to get US honors after burial snub" http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/World/Story/A1Story20110513-278644.html&lt;/ref&gt; Participants at the special ceremony held at the [[Laos Memorial]] within Arlington National Cemetery included the CPPA, LVA, U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of the Army, Members of the Congress, U.S. Special Forces Association, Counterparts Veterans Association and others.

{{anchor|Primary|Simple|Cylindrical|Metric|2|3}}A '''Venn diagram''' (also called '''primary diagram''', '''set diagram''' or '''logic diagram''') is a [[diagram]] that shows ''all'' possible [[logic]]al relations between a finite collection of different [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].  These diagrams depict [[element (mathematics)|element]]s as points in the plane, and [[set (mathematics)|set]]s as regions inside closed curves.  A Venn diagram consists of multiple overlapping closed curves, usually circles, each representing a set.  The points inside a curve labelled ''S'' represent elements of the set ''S'', while points outside the boundary represent elements not in the set ''S''.   This lends to easily read visualizations; for example, the set of all elements that are members of both sets ''S'' and ''T'', ''S''&amp;nbsp;∩&amp;nbsp;''T'', is represented visually by the area of overlap of the regions ''S'' and ''T''. In Venn diagrams the curves are overlapped in every possible way, showing all possible relations between the sets.  They are thus a special case of [[Euler diagram|Euler diagrams]], which do not necessarily show all relations. Venn diagrams were conceived around 1880 by [[John Venn]]. They are used to teach elementary [[set theory]], as well as illustrate simple set relationships in [[probability]], [[logic]], [[statistics]], [[linguistics]], and [[computer science]].

A Venn diagram in which the area of each shape is proportional to the number of elements it contains is called an '''area-proportional''' or '''scaled Venn diagram'''.

==Example==
[[File:Венов дијаграм.svg|thumb|left|Sets A (creatures with two legs) and B (creatures that can fly)]]
This example involves two [[Set (mathematics)|sets]], A and B, represented here as coloured circles. The orange circle, set A, represents all living creatures that are two-legged. The blue circle, set B, represents the living creatures that can fly. Each separate type of creature can be imagined as a point somewhere in the diagram.  Living creatures that both can fly ''and'' have two legs—for example, parrots—are then in both sets, so they correspond to points in the region where the blue and orange circles overlap. It is important to note that this overlapping region would only contain those elements (in this example creatures) that are members of both set A (two-legged creatures) and are also members of set B (flying creatures.)

Humans and penguins are bipedal, and so are then in the orange circle, but since they cannot fly they appear in the left part of the orange circle, where it does not overlap with the blue circle. Mosquitoes have six legs, and fly, so the point for mosquitoes is in the part of the blue circle that does not overlap with the orange one. Creatures that are not two-legged and cannot fly (for example, whales and spiders) would all be represented by points outside both circles.

The combined region of sets A and B is called the ''[[union (set theory)|union]]'' of A and B, denoted by {{nowrap|A ∪ B}}. The union in this case contains all living creatures that are either two-legged or that can fly (or both).

The region in both A and B, where the two sets overlap, is called the ''[[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]'' of A and B, denoted by {{nowrap|A ∩ B}}. For example, the intersection of the two sets is not empty, because there ''are'' points that represent creatures that are in ''both'' the orange and blue circles.

=={{anchor|Symmetric|n}}History==
[[File:Venn-stainedglass-gonville-caius.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Stained-glass]] window with Venn diagram in [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]]]
Venn diagrams were introduced in 1880 by [[John Venn]] in a paper entitled ''On the Diagrammatic and Mechanical Representation of Propositions and Reasonings'' in the "Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science", about the different ways to represent [[proposition]]s by diagrams.&lt;ref name="Venn1880_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Venn1880_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sandifer2003"/&gt; The use of these types of [[diagram]]s in [[formal logic]], according to [[Frank Ruskey]] and Mark Weston, is "not an easy history to trace, but it is certain that the diagrams that are popularly associated with Venn, in fact, originated much earlier. They are rightly associated with Venn, however, because he comprehensively surveyed and formalized their usage, and was the first to generalize them".&lt;ref name="Ruskey2005"/&gt;

Venn himself did not use the term "Venn diagram" and referred to his invention as "[[Eulerian Circle]]s".&lt;ref name="Sandifer2003"/&gt; For example, in the opening sentence of his 1880 article Venn writes, "Schemes of diagrammatic representation have been so familiarly introduced into logical treatises during the last century or so, that many readers, even those who have made no professional study of logic, may be supposed to be acquainted with the general nature and object of such devices. Of these schemes one only, viz. that commonly called 'Eulerian circles,' has met with any general acceptance..."&lt;ref name="Venn1880_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Venn1880_2"/&gt; Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) includes "Venn's Method of Diagrams" as well as "Euler's Method of Diagrams" in an "Appendix, Addressed to Teachers" of his book "Symbolic Logic" (4th edition published in 1896).  The term "Venn diagram" was later used by [[Clarence Irving Lewis]] in 1918, in his book "A Survey of Symbolic Logic".&lt;ref name="Ruskey2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis1918"/&gt;

Venn diagrams are very similar to [[Euler diagram]]s, which were invented by [[Leonhard Euler]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref group="note" name="NB_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Venn1881"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gailand_1967"/&gt; M.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Baron has noted that [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (1646–1716) in the 17th century produced similar diagrams before Euler, but much of it was unpublished.&lt;ref name="Leibniz_1690"/&gt; She also observes even earlier Euler-like diagrams by [[Ramon Llull]] in the 13th Century.&lt;ref name="Baron_1969"/&gt;

In the 20th century, Venn diagrams were further developed. D.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Henderson showed in 1963 that the existence of an ''n''-Venn diagram with ''n''-fold [[rotational symmetry]] implied that ''n'' was a [[prime number]].&lt;ref name="Henderson_1963"/&gt; He also showed that such symmetric Venn diagrams exist when ''n'' is 5 or 7. In 2002 Peter Hamburger found symmetric Venn diagrams for ''n'' = 11 and in 2003, Griggs, Killian, and Savage showed that symmetric Venn diagrams exist for all other primes. Thus rotationally symmetric Venn diagrams exist if and only if ''n'' is a prime number.&lt;ref name="Ruskey_2006"/&gt;

Venn diagrams and Euler diagrams were incorporated as part of instruction in [[set theory]] as part of the [[new math]] movement in the 1960s. Since then, they have also been adopted in the curriculum of other fields such as reading.&lt;ref name="Stategies"/&gt;

A Venn diagram is constructed with a collection of simple closed curves drawn in a plane. According to Lewis,&lt;ref name="Lewis1918"/&gt; the "principle of these diagrams is that classes [or ''[[set (mathematics)|set]]s''] be represented by regions in such relation to one another that all the possible logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is not-null".&lt;ref name="Lewis1918"/&gt;{{rp|157}}

Venn diagrams normally comprise overlapping [[circle]]s. The interior of the circle symbolically represents the [[element (mathematics)|element]]s of the set, while the exterior represents elements that are not members of the set. For instance, in a two-set Venn diagram, one circle may represent the group of all [[wood]]en objects, while another circle may represent the set of all tables. The overlapping region or ''[[intersection (set theory)|intersection]]'' would then represent the set of all wooden tables. Shapes other than circles can be employed as shown below by Venn's own higher set diagrams. Venn diagrams do not generally contain information on the relative or absolute sizes ([[cardinality]]) of sets; i.e. they are [[schematic]] diagrams.

Venn diagrams are similar to [[Euler diagram]]s. However, a Venn diagram for ''n'' component sets must contain all 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; hypothetically possible zones that correspond to some combination of inclusion or exclusion in each of the component sets. Euler diagrams contain only the actually possible zones in a given context. In Venn diagrams, a shaded zone may represent an empty zone, whereas in an Euler diagram the corresponding zone is missing from the diagram. For example, if one set represents ''dairy products'' and another ''cheeses'', the Venn diagram contains a zone for cheeses that are not dairy products. Assuming that in the context ''cheese'' means some type of dairy product, the Euler diagram has the cheese zone entirely contained within the dairy-product zone—there is no zone for (non-existent) non-dairy cheese. This means that as the number of contours increases, Euler diagrams are typically less visually complex than the equivalent Venn diagram, particularly if the number of non-empty intersections is small.&lt;ref name="Kent_2004"/&gt;

The difference between Euler and Venn diagrams can be seen in the following example. Take the three sets:

* &lt;math&gt;A = \{1,\, 2,\, 5\}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;B = \{1,\, 6\}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;C = \{4,\, 7\}&lt;/math&gt;

The Venn and the Euler diagram of those sets are:

=={{anchor|Elegant|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11}}Extensions to higher numbers of sets==
Venn diagrams typically represent two or three sets, but there are forms that allow for higher numbers. Shown below, four intersecting spheres form the highest order Venn diagram that has the symmetry of a [[simplex]] and can be visually represented. The 16 intersections correspond to the vertices of a [[tesseract]] (or the cells of a [[16-cell]] respectively).

For higher numbers of sets, some loss of symmetry in the diagrams is unavoidable. Venn was keen to find "symmetrical figures...elegant in themselves,"&lt;ref name="Venn1881"/&gt; that represented higher numbers of sets, and he devised an ''elegant'' four-set diagram using [[ellipse]]s (see below). He also gave a construction for Venn diagrams for ''any'' number of sets, where each successive curve that delimits a set interleaves with previous curves, starting with the three-circle diagram.

[[Anthony William Fairbank Edwards]] constructed a series of Venn diagrams for higher numbers of sets by segmenting the surface of a sphere, which became known as Edwards–Venn diagrams.&lt;ref name="Edwards_2004"/&gt; For example, three sets can be easily represented by taking three hemispheres of the sphere at right angles (''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''z''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0). A fourth set can be added to the representation by taking a curve similar to the seam on a tennis ball, which winds up and down around the equator, and so on. The resulting sets can then be projected back to a plane to give ''cogwheel'' diagrams with increasing numbers of teeth, as shown here. These diagrams were devised while designing a [[stained-glass]] window in memory of Venn.&lt;ref name="Edwards_2004"/&gt;

===Other diagrams===
Edwards–Venn diagrams are [[topological equivalence|topologically equivalent]] to diagrams devised by [[Branko Grünbaum]], which were based around intersecting [[polygon]]s with increasing numbers of sides. They are also two-dimensional representations of [[hypercube]]s.

[[Henry John Stephen Smith]] devised similar ''n''-set diagrams using [[sine]] curves&lt;ref name="Edwards_2004"/&gt; with the series of equations
: &lt;math&gt;y_i = \frac {\sin(2^{i }x)}{2 i} \text{ where } 0 \leq i \leq n-2 \text{ and } i \in \mathbb{N}. &lt;/math&gt;

[[Charles Lutwidge Dodgson]] (aka [[Lewis Carroll]]) devised a five-set diagram known as [[Carroll's square (diagram)|Carroll's square]]. Jeremiah Joven Joaquin and Robert James Boyles, on the other hand, proposed supplemental rules for the standard Venn diagram in able to account for certain problem cases. For instance, regarding the issue of representing singular statements, they suggest to consider the Venn diagram circle as a representation of a set of things, and use [[first-order logic]] and [[set theory]] to treat categorical statements as statements about sets. Additionally, they propose to treat singular statements as statements about [[set membership]]. So, for example, to represent the statement “a is F” in this retooled Venn diagram, a small letter “a” may be placed inside the circle that represents the set F.&lt;ref&gt;Joaquin, J.J. and Boyles, R.J.M. (2017). [https://www.pdcnet.org/teachphil/content/teachphil_2017_0040_0002_0161_0180 Teaching Syllogistic Logic via a Retooled Venn Diagrammatical Technique].

=={{anchor|Johnston}}Related concepts==
[[File:Venn3tab.svg|thumb|Venn diagram as a truth table]]
Venn diagrams correspond to [[truth table]]s for the propositions &lt;math&gt;x\in A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x\in B&lt;/math&gt;, etc., in the sense that each region of Venn diagram corresponds to one row of the truth table.&lt;ref name="Grimaldi_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson_2001"/&gt; This type is also known as Johnston diagram. Another way of representing sets is with John F. Randolph's [[R-diagram]]s.

'''Zipf's law''' ({{IPAc-en|z|ɪ|f}}) is an [[empirical law]] formulated using [[mathematical statistics]] that refers to the fact that many types of data studied in the [[physical science|physical]] and [[social science|social]] sciences can be approximated with a Zipfian distribution, one of a family of related discrete [[power law]] [[probability distribution]]s.  ''Zipf distribution'' is related to the [[zeta distribution]], but is not identical.

For example, Zipf's law states that given some [[Text corpus|corpus]] of [[natural language]] utterances, the frequency of any word is [[inversely proportional]] to its rank in the [[frequency table]]. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the [[rank-frequency distribution]] is an inverse relation. For example, in the [[Brown Corpus]] of American English text, the word ''[[English articles#Definite article|the]]'' is the most frequently occurring word, and by itself accounts for nearly 7% of all word occurrences (69,971 out of slightly over 1 million). True to Zipf's Law, the second-place word ''of'' accounts for slightly over 3.5% of words (36,411 occurrences), followed by ''and'' (28,852). Only 135 vocabulary items are needed to account for half the Brown Corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=An introduction to textual econometrics|first1=Stephen|last1=Fagan|first2=Ramazan|last2=Gençay|pages=133–153|title=Handbook of Empirical Economics and Finance|editor1-first=Aman|editor1-last=Ullah|editor2-first=David E.

The law is named after the American [[linguistics|linguist]] [[George Kingsley Zipf]] (1902–1950), who popularized it and sought to explain it (Zipf 1935, 1949), though he did not claim to have originated it.&lt;ref name=Powers1998&gt;{{cite journal| last = Powers | first = David M W| url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/W98-1218 |title=Applications and explanations of Zipf's law| year = 1998| conference = Joint conference on new methods in language processing and computational natural language learning| pages = 151–160| publisher = Association for Computational Linguistics }}&lt;/ref&gt; The French stenographer [[Jean-Baptiste Estoup]] (1868–1950) appears to have noticed the regularity before Zipf.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher D.

The same relationship occurs in many other rankings unrelated to language, such as the population ranks of cities in various countries, corporation sizes, income rankings, ranks of number of people watching the same TV channel,&lt;ref&gt;M.

Suggests a heterogeneous Zipf-law TV channel-selection model&lt;/ref&gt; and so on. The appearance of the distribution in rankings of cities by population was first noticed by Felix Auerbach in 1913.&lt;ref name="Auerbach1913"/&gt; Empirically, a data set can be tested to see whether Zipf's law applies by checking the goodness of fit of an empirical distribution to the hypothesized power law distribution with a [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]], and then comparing the (log) likelihood ratio of the power law distribution to alternative distributions like an exponential distribution or lognormal distribution.&lt;ref name="Clausetetal2009"&gt;Clauset, A., Shalizi, C. R., &amp; Newman, M. E. J. (2009). Power-Law Distributions in Empirical Data. SIAM Review, 51(4), 661–703. doi:10.1137/070710111&lt;/ref&gt; When Zipf's law is checked for cities, a better fit has been found with exponent ''s'' = 1.07; i.e. the &lt;math&gt;n^{th}&lt;/math&gt; largest settlement is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{n^{1.07}}&lt;/math&gt; the size of the largest settlement.

==Theoretical review==
Zipf's law is most easily observed by [[graph of a function|plotting]] the data on a [[log-log]] graph, with the axes being [[logarithm|log]] (rank order) and log (frequency). For example, the word ''"the"'' (as described above) would appear at ''x'' = log(1), ''y'' = log(69971). It is also possible to plot reciprocal rank against frequency or reciprocal frequency or interword interval against rank.&lt;ref name=Powers1998/&gt; The data conform to Zipf's law to the extent that the plot is [[linear equation|linear]].

Formally, let:
* ''N'' be the number of elements;
* ''k'' be their rank;
* ''s'' be the value of the exponent characterizing the distribution.
Zipf's law then predicts that out of a population of ''N'' elements, the normalized frequency of elements of rank ''k'', ''f''(''k'';''s'',''N''), is:

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;s,N)=\frac{1/k^s}{\sum\limits_{n=1}^N (1/n^s)}&lt;/math&gt;

Zipf's law holds if the number of elements with a given frequency is a random variable with power law distribution &lt;math&gt;p(f) = \alpha f^{-1-1/s}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Adamic2000&gt;Adamic, Lada A. (2000) [http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/papers/ranking/ranking.html "Zipf, Power-laws, and Pareto - a ranking tutorial", originally published at http://www.parc.xerox.com/istl/groups/iea/papers/ranking/ranking.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026062626/http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/idl/papers/ranking/ranking.html |date=2007-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed that this representation of Zipf's law is more suitable for statistical testing, and in this way it has been analyzed in more than 30,000 English texts. The goodness-of-fit tests yield that only about 15% of the texts are statistically compatible with this form of Zipf's law. Slight variations in the definition of Zipf's law can increase this percentage up to close to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Moreno-Sánchez|first = I|last2 = Font-Clos|first2 = F|last3 = Corral|first3 = A|date = 2016|title = Large-Scale Analysis of Zipf’s Law in English Texts|url =|journal = PLoS ONE|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0147073|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the example of the frequency of words in the English language, ''N'' is the number of words in the English language and, if we use the classic version of Zipf's law, the exponent ''s'' is 1. ''f''(''k'';&amp;nbsp;''s'',''N'') will then be the fraction of the time the ''k''th most common word occurs.

The law may also be written:

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;s,N)=\frac{1}{k^s H_{N,s}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H&lt;sub&gt;N,s&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the ''N''th generalized [[harmonic number]].

The simplest case of Zipf's law is a "&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; function." Given a set of Zipfian distributed frequencies, sorted from most common to least common, the second most common frequency will occur ½ as often as the first.  The third most common frequency will occur ⅓ as often as the first. The fourth most common frequency will occur ¼ as often as the first. The ''n''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; most common frequency will occur &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as often as the first. However, this cannot hold exactly, because items must occur an integer number of times; there cannot be 2.5 occurrences of a word. Nevertheless, over fairly wide ranges, and to a fairly good approximation, many natural phenomena obey Zipf's law.

In human languages, word frequencies have a very heavy-tailed distribution, and can therefore be modeled reasonably well by a Zipf distribution with an ''s'' close to 1.

As long as the exponent ''s'' exceeds 1, it is possible for such a law to hold with infinitely many words, since if ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 then
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta (s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}&lt;\infty. \!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''ζ'' is [[Riemann zeta function|Riemann's zeta function]].

Although Zipf’s Law holds for all languages, even non-natural ones like [[Esperanto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author1=Bill Manaris |author2=Luca Pellicoro |author3=George Pothering |author4=Harland Hodges |title=INVESTIGATING ESPERANTO’S STATISTICAL PROPORTIONS RELATIVE TO OTHER LANGUAGES USING NEURAL NETWORKS AND ZIPF’S LAW |url=http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |journal=[[Artificial Intelligence and Applications]] |date=13 February 2006 |location=Innsbruck, Austria |pages=102–108 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305040450/http://www.cs.cofc.edu/~manaris/uploads/Main/IASTED2006.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the reason is still not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Brillouin]], ''La science et la théorie de l'information'', 1959, réédité en 1988, traduction anglaise rééditée en 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may be partially explained by the statistical analysis of randomly generated texts. Wentian Li has shown that in a document in which each character has been chosen randomly from a uniform distribution of all letters (plus a space character), the "words" follow the general trend of Zipf's law (appearing approximately linear on log-log plot).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wentian Li |title=Random Texts Exhibit Zipf's-Law-Like Word Frequency Distribution |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.164.8422&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |journal=[[IEEE Transactions on Information Theory]] |volume=38 |issue=6 |year=1992 |pages=1842–1845 |doi=10.1109/18.165464 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527030629/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.164.8422&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |archivedate=2016-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Vitold Belevitch]] in a paper, ''On the Statistical Laws of Linguistic Distribution'' offered a mathematical derivation.  He took a large class of well-behaved [[statistical distribution]]s (not only the [[normal distribution]]) and expressed them in terms of rank. He then expanded each expression into a [[Taylor series]]. In every case Belevitch obtained the remarkable result that a first-order truncation of the series resulted in Zipf's law. Further, a second-order truncation of the Taylor series resulted in [[Zipf–Mandelbrot law|Mandelbrot's law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter G.

The [[principle of least effort]] is another possible explanation:
Zipf himself proposed that neither speakers nor hearers using a given language want to work any harder than necessary to reach understanding, and the process that results in approximately equal distribution of effort leads to the observed Zipf distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Similarly, [[preferential attachment]] (intuitively, "the rich get richer" or "success breeds success") that results in the [[Yule–Simon distribution]] has been shown to fit word frequency versus rank in language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4846.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-06-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610173330/http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.4846.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and population versus city rank&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08535.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2018-01-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610203644/http://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.08535.pdf |archivedate=2016-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; better than Zipf's law. It was originally derived to explain population versus rank in species by Yule, and applied to cities by Simon.

==Related laws==

[[Image:Wikipedia-n-zipf.png|thumb|left|320px|A plot of word frequency in Wikipedia (November 27, 2006). The plot is in [[log-log]] coordinates. ''x''&amp;nbsp; is rank of a word in the frequency table; ''y''&amp;nbsp; is the total number of the word’s occurrences. Most popular words are "the", "of" and "and", as expected. Zipf's law corresponds to the middle linear portion of the curve, roughly following the green (1/''x'')&amp;nbsp; line, while the early part is closer to the magenta (1/''x''&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt;) line while the later part is closer to the cyan (1/(''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''x'')&lt;sup&gt;2.0&lt;/sup&gt;) line. These lines correspond to three distinct parameterizations of the Zipf–Mandelbrot distribution, overall a [[broken power law]] with three segments: a head, middle, and tail.]]

''Zipf's law'' in fact refers more generally to frequency distributions of "rank data," in which the relative frequency of the ''n''th-ranked item is given by the [[Zeta distribution]], 1/(''n''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;''ζ''(''s'')), where the parameter ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1 indexes the members of this family of [[probability distribution]]s.  Indeed, ''Zipf's law'' is sometimes synonymous with "zeta distribution," since probability distributions are sometimes called "laws". This distribution is sometimes called the '''Zipfian''' distribution.

A generalization of Zipf's law is the [[Zipf–Mandelbrot law]], proposed by [[Benoît Mandelbrot]], whose frequencies are:

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;N,q,s)=\frac{[\text{constant}]}{(k+q)^s}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

The "constant" is the reciprocal of the [[Hurwitz zeta function]] evaluated at ''s''. In practice, as easily observable in distribution plots for large corpora, the observed distribution can be modelled more accurately as a sum of separate distributions for different subsets or subtypes of words that follow different parameterizations of the Zipf–Mandelbrot distribution, in particular the closed class of functional words exhibit ''s'' lower than 1, while open-ended vocabulary growth with document size and corpus size require ''s'' greater than 1 for convergence of the [[harmonic series (mathematics)|Generalized Harmonic Series]].&lt;ref name=Powers1998/&gt;

Zipfian distributions can be obtained from [[Pareto distribution]]s by an exchange of variables.&lt;ref name="Adamic2000"/&gt;

The Zipf distribution is sometimes called the '''discrete Pareto distribution'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Univariate Discrete Distributions|edition=second|year=1992|author1=N. L. Johnson |author2=S. Kotz |author3=A. W. Kemp  |last-author-amp=yes |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-471-54897-9|ref=harv}}, p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt; because it is analogous to the continuous [[Pareto distribution]] in the same way that the [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|discrete uniform distribution]] is analogous to the [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|continuous uniform distribution]].

The tail frequencies of the [[Yule–Simon distribution]] are approximately

:&lt;math&gt;f(k;\rho) \approx \frac{[\text{constant}]}{k^{\rho+1}}&lt;/math&gt;

for any choice of ''ρ'' &gt; 0.

In the [[parabolic fractal distribution]], the logarithm of the frequency is a quadratic polynomial of the logarithm of the rank. This can markedly improve the fit over a simple power-law relationship.&lt;ref name="Galien"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.zonnet.nl/galien8/factor/factor.html |title=Factorial randomness: the Laws of Benford and Zipf with respect to the first digit distribution of the factor sequence from the natural numbers |author=Johan Gerard van der Galien |date=2003-11-08 |accessdate=8 July 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305150334/http://home.zonnet.nl/galien8/factor/factor.html |archivedate=2007-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like fractal dimension, it is possible to calculate Zipf dimension, which is a useful parameter in the analysis of texts.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Eftekhari (2006) Fractal geometry of texts. ''Journal of Quantitative Linguistic'' 13(2-3): 177–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that [[Benford's law]] is a special bounded case of Zipf's law,&lt;ref name="Galien"/&gt; with the connection between these two laws being explained by  their both originating from scale invariant functional relations from statistical physics and critical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;L.

== Applications ==
In [[information theory]], a symbol (event, signal) of probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;\log_2(1/p)&lt;/math&gt; [[bit]]s of information. Hence, Zipf law for natural numbers: &lt;math&gt;\Pr(x) \approx 1/x&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent with number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;\log_2(x)&lt;/math&gt; bits of information. To add information from a symbol of probability &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; into information already stored in a natural number &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, we should go to &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\log_2(x') \approx \log_2(x) + \log_2(1/p)&lt;/math&gt;, or equivalently &lt;math&gt;x' \approx x/p&lt;/math&gt;. For instance, in standard binary system we would have &lt;math&gt;x' = 2x + s&lt;/math&gt;, what is optimal for &lt;math&gt;\Pr(s=0) = \Pr(s=1) = 1/2&lt;/math&gt; probability distribution. Using &lt;math&gt;x' \approx x/p&lt;/math&gt; rule for a general probability distribution is the base of [[Asymmetric Numeral Systems]] family of  [[entropy coding]] methods used in [[data compression]], which state distribution is also governed by Zipf law.

Zipf's law also has been used for extraction of parallel fragments of texts out of comparable corpora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2016/pdf/BUCC04.pdf |title=Parallel Document Identification using Zipf's Law |last1=Mohammadi |first1=Mehdi |author-link1= |date=2016 |publisher= |book-title=Proceedings of the Ninth Workshop on Building and Using Comparable Corpora |pages=21–25, |location=Portorož, Slovenia |conference=LREC 2016 |id= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323154706/https://comparable.limsi.fr/bucc2016/pdf/BUCC04.pdf |archivedate=2018-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
