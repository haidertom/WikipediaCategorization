'''[[Abuse]] of [[Power (social and political)|power]]''', in the form of "[[malfeasance in office]]" or "official misconduct," is the commission of an [[Crime|unlawful]] act, done in an official capacity, which affects the performance of official duties. Malfeasance in office is often grounds for a [[for cause]] removal of an elected official by [[statute]] or [[recall election]]. Abuse of power can also mean a person using the power they have for their own personal gain.

==Institutional abuse==
[[Institutional abuse]] is the maltreatment of a person (often children or older adults) by a system of power.&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;{{cite journal|last=Powers|first=J. L.|author2=A. Mooney &amp; M. Nunno|title=Institutional abuse: A review of the literature|journal=Journal of Child and Youth Care|year=1990|volume=4|issue=6|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can range from acts similar to home-based [[child abuse]], such as [[neglect]], [[physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse|sexual]] abuse, to the effects of assistance programs working below acceptable service standards, or relying on harsh or unfair ways to modify behavior.&lt;ref name=Powers /&gt;

==Examples==
{{Incomplete section|date=January 2018}}
===Joe Arpaio===
{{Main|Joe Arpaio}}
In February 2010, Judge John Leonardo found that Arpaio "misused the power of his office to target members of the Board of Supervisors for criminal investigation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wingett |first=Yvonne |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/02/25/20100225wilcox0225.html#ixzz0y8iImUJ8 |title=Supervisor cases collapse |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2010-02-25 |accessdate=2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a federal grand jury began an inquiry of Arpaio for abuse of power, in connection with an FBI investigation.&lt;ref name=KPHO&gt;{{cite news|title=Sources: FBI Investigating Joe Arpaio |url=http://www.kpho.com/news/21470567/detail.html |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |newspaper=KPHO |date=Oct 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020184811/http://www.kpho.com/news/21470567/detail.html |archivedate=October 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news |last=Conder |first=Chuck |title=Arizona sheriff under investigation for alleged abuse of power |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/CRIME/07/09/arizona.tough.sheriff/index.html?video=true&amp;hpt=T2 |accessdate=July 10, 2010 |newspaper=CNN |date=July 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 31, 2012, the Arizona US Attorney's office announced that it was "closing its investigation into allegations of criminal conduct" by Arpaio, without filing charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/08/31/feds-close-criminal-investigation-into-maricopa-county-sheriff-joe-arpaio/ |title=Feds close criminal investigation into Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio |publisher=Fox News |date=August 31, 2012 |accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arpaio was investigated for politically motivated and "bogus" prosecutions, which a former US Attorney called "utterly unacceptable".&lt;ref name="KPHO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt; Phoenix Mayor [[Phil Gordon (politician)|Phil Gordon]] has called Arpaio's "long list" of questionable prosecutions "a reign of terror".&lt;ref name="CNN" /&gt;

===Fa Zheng===
{{Main|Fa Zheng}}
Fa Zheng, a Chinese man, was appointed as the Administrator (太守) of Shu [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] (蜀郡) and "General Who Spreads Martial Might" (揚武將軍) by Liu Bei. He oversaw administrative affairs in the vicinity of Yi Province's capital [[Chengdu]] and served as Liu Bei's chief adviser.&lt;ref&gt;(以正為蜀郡太守、揚武將軍，外統都畿，內為謀主。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period of time, he abused his power by taking personal revenge against those who offended him before and killing them without reason. Some officials approached [[Zhuge Liang]], another of Liu Bei's key advisers, and urged him to report Fa Zheng's lawless behaviour to their lord and take action against him. However, Zhuge Liang replied, "When our lord was in Gong'an (公安), he was wary of [[Cao Cao]]'s influence in the north and fearful of [[Sun Quan]]'s presence in the east. Even in home territory he was afraid that [[Lady Sun]] might stir up trouble. He was in such a difficult situation at the time that he could neither advance nor retreat. Fa Xiaozhi supported and helped him so much, such that he is now able to fly high and no longer remain under others' influence. How can we stop Fa Zheng from behaving as he wishes?" Zhuge Liang was aware that Liu Bei favoured and trusted Fa Zheng, which was why he refused to intervene in this matter.&lt;ref&gt;(一飡之德，睚眦之怨，無不報復，擅殺毀傷己者數人。或謂諸葛亮曰：「法正於蜀郡太縱橫，將軍宜啟主公，抑其威福。」亮荅曰：「主公之在公安也，北畏曹公之彊，東憚孫權之逼，近則懼孫夫人生變於肘腋之下；當斯之時，進退狼跋，法孝直為之輔翼，令翻然翱翔，不可復制，如何禁止法正使不得行其意邪！」初，孫權以妹妻先主，妹才捷剛猛，有諸兄之風，侍婢百餘人，皆親執刀侍立，先主每入，衷心常凜凜；亮又知先主雅愛信正，故言如此。) ''Sanguozhi'' vol. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police officers===
{{further|Legal abuse#Law enforcement abuse|Abuse#Police abuse|Police brutality}}
In dictatorial, corrupt, or weak states, police officers may carry out many criminal acts for the ruling regime with impunity.

Individual officers, or sometimes whole units, can be [[Police corruption|corrupt]] or carry out various forms of [[police misconduct]]; this occasionally happens in many forces, but can be more common where police pay is very low unless supplemented by [[bribe]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38075 |title=IPS: DRUGS-MEXICO: Police Caught Between Low Wages, Threats and Bribes |publisher=Ipsnews.net |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2010-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620183631/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38075 |archivedate=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Police officers sometimes act with unwarranted [[Police brutality|brutality]] when they overreact to confrontational situations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Edwards |first=Richard |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/g20-summit/5172206/Ian-Tomlinson-G20-protests-death-police-office-faces-manslaughter-charge.html |title=Ian Tomlinson G20 protests death: police office faces manslaughter charge |work=The Telegraph |date=2009-04-17 |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; to extract a confession from a person they may or may not genuinely suspect of being guilty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517014.100-you-did-it-didnt-you-the-police-often-argue-that-thetough-interviewing-of-suspects-is-the-best-way-to-extract-the-truth-butsuch-strategies-are-exactly-the-sort-to-provoke-false-confessions-.html |title=The police often argue that the tough 'interviewing' of suspects is the best way to extract the truth.

Physicists are undecided whether this means the universe began from a singularity, or that current knowledge is insufficient to describe the universe at that time. Detailed measurements of the expansion rate of the universe place the Big Bang at around 13.8 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]] years ago, which is thus considered the [[age of the universe]].&lt;ref name="esa"&gt;{{cite web |title=Planck reveals an almost perfect universe |work=PLANCK |publisher=[[ESA]] |date=2013-03-21 |url=

Giant clouds of these primordial elements (mostly [[hydrogen]], with some [[helium]] and [[lithium]]) later coalesced through [[gravity]], eventually forming early [[star]]s and [[Galaxy|galaxies]], the descendants of which are visible today. Astronomers also observe the gravitational effects of [[dark matter]] surrounding galaxies. Though most of the mass in the universe seems to be in the form of dark matter, Big Bang theory and various observations seem to indicate that it is not made out of conventional [[baryonic matter]] (protons, neutrons, and electrons) but it is unclear exactly what it ''is'' made out of.

Since [[Georges Lemaître]] first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once divided between supporters of two different theories, the Big Bang and the [[Steady State theory]], but a wide range of [[empirical evidence]] has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted.&lt;ref name="Kragh_1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kragh |first=Helge |authorlink=Helge Kragh |title=Cosmology and Controversy |pages=318, 319 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=1996 |url=

American astronomer Edwin Hubble observed that the distances to faraway galaxies were strongly correlated with their [[redshift]]s. This was interpreted to mean that all distant galaxies and clusters are receding away from our vantage point with an apparent velocity proportional to their distance: that is, the farther they are, the faster they move away from us, regardless of direction.&lt;ref name="hubble"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming the [[Copernican principle]] (that the Earth is not the center of the universe), the only remaining interpretation is that all observable regions of the universe are receding from all others. Since we know that the distance between galaxies increases today, it must mean that in the past galaxies were closer together. The continuous expansion of the universe implies that the universe was denser and hotter in the past.

Large [[particle accelerator]]s can replicate the conditions that prevailed after the early moments of the universe, resulting in confirmation and refinement of the details of the Big Bang model. However, these accelerators can only probe so far into [[high-energy physics|high energy regimes]]. Consequently, the state of the universe in the earliest instants of the Big Bang expansion is still poorly understood and an area of open investigation and speculation.

The first [[subatomic particle]]s to be formed included [[proton]]s, [[neutron]]s, and [[electron]]s. Though simple [[big bang nucleosynthesis|atomic nuclei formed]] within the first three minutes after the Big Bang, thousands of years passed before the first [[Recombination (cosmology)|electrically neutral atoms formed]]. The majority of atoms produced by the Big Bang were [[hydrogen]], along with [[helium]] and traces of [[lithium]]. Giant clouds of these primordial elements later coalesced through [[gravity]] to form [[star]]s and galaxies, and the heavier elements were synthesized either [[Stellar nucleosynthesis|within stars]] or [[supernova nucleosynthesis|during supernovae]].

The Big Bang theory offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of observed phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the [[cosmic microwave background|CMB]], [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|large scale structure]], and [[Hubble's Law]].&lt;ref name=Wright2009&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework for the Big Bang model relies on [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] and on simplifying assumptions such as [[homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of space. The governing equations were formulated by [[Alexander Friedmann]], and similar solutions were worked on by [[Willem de Sitter]]. Since then, astrophysicists have incorporated observational and theoretical additions into the Big Bang model, and its [[parametrization]] as the [[Lambda-CDM model]] serves as the framework for current investigations of theoretical cosmology. The Lambda-CDM model is the current "standard model" of Big Bang cosmology, [[Scientific consensus|consensus]] is that it is the simplest model that can account for the various measurements and [[Observational cosmology|observations relevant to cosmology]].

In either case, "the Big Bang" as an event is also colloquially referred to as the "birth" of our universe since it represents the point in history where the universe can be verified to have entered into a [[Equation of state (cosmology)|regime]] where the laws of physics as we understand them (specifically general relativity and the [[Standard Model|standard model of particle physics]]) work.

Despite being extremely [[density|dense]] at this time—far denser than is usually required to form a [[black hole]]—the universe did not re-collapse into a black hole. This may be explained by considering that commonly-used calculations and limits for [[gravitational collapse]] are usually based upon objects of relatively constant size, such as [[star]]s, and do not apply to [[metric expansion of space|rapidly expanding space]] such as the Big Bang.

=== Inflation and baryogenesis ===
{{Main| Cosmic inflation|baryogenesis}}
The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation. In the most common models the universe was filled [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneously]] and [[isotropic]]ally with a very high [[energy density]] and huge temperatures and [[pressure]]s and was very rapidly expanding and cooling. Approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;−37&lt;/sup&gt; seconds into the expansion, a [[phase transition]] caused a [[cosmic inflation]], during which the universe grew [[exponential growth|exponentially]] during which time [[Quantum fluctuation|density fluctuations]] that occurred because of the [[uncertainty principle]] were amplified into the seeds that would later form the [[Structure formation|large-scale structure]] of the universe.&lt;ref name="guth"&gt;{{cite book

This resulted in the predominance of [[matter]] over [[antimatter]] in the present universe.&lt;ref name="kolb_c6"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The universe continued to decrease in density and fall in temperature, hence the typical energy of each particle was decreasing. [[Explicit symmetry breaking|Symmetry breaking]] phase transitions put the [[fundamental force]]s of physics and the parameters of [[elementary particles]] into their present form.&lt;ref name="kolb_c7"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt; After about 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, the picture becomes less speculative, since particle energies drop to values that can be attained in [[particle accelerator]]s. At about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; seconds, quarks and gluons combined to form [[baryon]]s such as protons and neutrons. The small excess of quarks over antiquarks led to a small excess of baryons over antibaryons. The temperature was now no longer high enough to create new proton–antiproton pairs (similarly for neutrons–antineutrons), so a mass annihilation immediately followed, leaving just one in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; of the original protons and neutrons, and none of their antiparticles. A similar process happened at about 1 second for electrons and positrons. After these annihilations, the remaining protons, neutrons and electrons were no longer moving relativistically and the energy density of the universe was dominated by [[photon]]s (with a minor contribution from [[neutrino]]s).

A few minutes into the expansion, when the temperature was about a billion (one thousand million) [[kelvin]] and the density was about that of air, neutrons combined with protons to form the universe's [[deuterium]] and helium [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] in a process called [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]].&lt;ref name="kolb_c4"/&gt; Most protons remained uncombined as hydrogen nuclei.&lt;ref name="peacock_c9"/&gt;

As the universe cooled, the [[rest mass]] energy density of matter came to gravitationally dominate that of the photon [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]]. After about 379,000 years, the electrons and nuclei combined into atoms (mostly hydrogen); hence the radiation decoupled from matter and continued through space largely unimpeded. This relic radiation is known as the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]].&lt;ref name="peacock_c9"&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Biochemistry|chemistry of life]] may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]], during a habitable epoch when the universe was only 10–17 million years old.&lt;ref name="Loeb_2014"&gt;{{cite web |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |format=PDF |publisher=Cambridge University Press / Astronomy Department, Harvard University |date=24 September 2014 |url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/habitable.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IJA-2014October"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loeb |first=Abraham |authorlink=Abraham Loeb |title=The Habitable Epoch of the Early Universe |date=October 2014 |journal=[[International Journal of Astrobiology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=337–339 |doi=10.1017/S1473550414000196 |arxiv=1312.0613 |bibcode=2014IJAsB..13..337L|citeseerx=10.1.1.748.4820 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141202"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dreifus |first=Claudia |authorlink=Claudia Dreifus |title=Much-Discussed Views That Go Way Back - Avi Loeb Ponders the Early Universe, Nature and Life |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/02/science/avi-loeb-ponders-the-early-universe-nature-and-life.html |date=2 December 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic acceleration ===
{{Main|Accelerating expansion of the universe}}
Independent lines of evidence from Type Ia supernovae and the [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] imply that the universe today is dominated by a mysterious form of energy known as [[dark energy]], which apparently permeates all of space. The observations suggest 73% of the total energy density of today's universe is in this form. When the universe was very young, it was likely infused with dark energy, but with less space and everything closer together, gravity predominated, and it was slowly braking the expansion. But eventually, after numerous billion years of expansion, the growing abundance of dark energy caused the [[Hubble's law|expansion of the universe]] to slowly begin to accelerate.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

Dark energy in its simplest formulation takes the form of the [[cosmological constant]] term in [[Einstein's field equation]]s of general relativity, but its composition and mechanism are unknown and, more generally, the details of its [[equation of state (cosmology)|equation of state]] and relationship with the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics continue to be investigated both through observation and theoretically.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

All of this cosmic evolution after the [[inflationary epoch]] can be rigorously described and modeled by the ΛCDM model of cosmology, which uses the independent frameworks of quantum mechanics and Einstein's General Relativity. There is no well-supported model describing the action prior to 10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; seconds or so. Apparently a new unified theory of [[quantum gravity|quantum gravitation]] is needed to break this barrier. Understanding this earliest of eras in the history of the universe is currently one of the greatest [[unsolved problems in physics]].

== Features of the model ==
The Big Bang theory depends on two major assumptions: the universality of [[physical law]]s and the [[cosmological principle]]. The cosmological principle states that on large scales the universe is [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropy|isotropic]].

These ideas were initially taken as postulates, but today there are efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the [[fine structure constant]] over much of the [[age of the universe]] is of order 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

If the large-scale universe appears isotropic as viewed from Earth, the cosmological principle can be derived from the simpler [[Copernican principle]], which states that there is no preferred (or special) observer or vantage point. To this end, the cosmological principle has been confirmed to a level of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; via observations of the CMB. The universe has been measured to be homogeneous on the largest scales at the 10% level.&lt;ref&gt;

===Expansion of space===
{{Main|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Metric expansion of space}}
General relativity describes spacetime by a [[metric tensor|metric]], which determines the distances that separate nearby points. The points, which can be galaxies, stars, or other objects, are themselves specified using a [[coordinate chart]] or "grid" that is laid down over all [[spacetime]]. The cosmological principle implies that the metric should be [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]] and [[isotropic]] on large scales, which uniquely singles out the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW metric). 
This metric contains a [[scale factor]], which describes how the size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a [[coordinate system]] to be made, called [[comoving coordinates]]. In this coordinate system, the grid expands along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their ''coordinate'' distance ([[comoving distance]]) remains constant, the ''physical'' distance between two such co-moving points expands proportionally with the [[scale factor]] of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter moving outward to fill an empty universe. Instead, [[metric expansion of space|space itself expands]] with time everywhere and increases the physical distance between two comoving points. In other words, the Big Bang is not an explosion ''in space'', but rather an expansion ''of space''.&lt;ref name="HTUW"/&gt; Because the FLRW metric assumes a uniform distribution of mass and energy, it applies to our universe only on large scales—local concentrations of matter such as our galaxy are gravitationally bound and as such do not experience the large-scale expansion of space.&lt;ref&gt;Tamara M. Davis and Charles H. Lineweaver, ''Expanding Confusion: common misconceptions of cosmological horizons and the superluminal expansion of the Universe''. [https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0310808 astro-ph/0310808]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horizons===
{{Main|List of cosmological horizons}}
An important feature of the Big Bang spacetime is the presence of [[particle horizon]]s. Since the universe has a finite age, and light travels at a finite speed, there may be events in the past whose light has not had time to reach us. This places a limit or a ''past horizon'' on the most distant objects that can be observed. Conversely, because space is expanding, and more distant objects are receding ever more quickly, light emitted by us today may never "catch up" to very distant objects. This defines a ''future horizon'', which limits the events in the future that we will be able to influence. The presence of either type of horizon depends on the details of the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|FLRW]] model that describes our universe.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"/&gt;

Our understanding of the universe back to very early times [[Big Bang#Horizon problem|suggests]] that there is a past horizon, though in practice our view is also limited by the opacity of the universe at early times. So our view cannot extend further backward in time, though the horizon recedes in space. If the expansion of the universe continues to [[accelerating universe|accelerate]], there is a future horizon as well.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Etymology===
English astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]] is credited with coining the term "Big Bang" during a 1949 BBC radio broadcast, saying: "These theories were based on the hypothesis that all the matter in the universe was created in one big bang at a particular time in the remote past."&lt;ref&gt;

It is popularly reported that Hoyle, who favored an alternative "[[steady state universe|steady state]]" cosmological model, intended this to be pejorative,&lt;ref&gt;

The Big Bang theory developed from observations of the structure of the universe and from theoretical considerations. In 1912 [[Vesto Slipher]] measured the first [[Doppler shift]] of a "[[spiral nebula]]" (spiral nebula is the obsolete term for spiral galaxies), and soon discovered that almost all such nebulae were receding from Earth. He did not grasp the cosmological implications of this fact, and indeed at the time it was [[Shapley–Curtis debate|highly controversial]] whether or not these nebulae were "island universes" outside our [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;

In 1931 Lemaître went further and suggested that the evident expansion of the universe, if projected back in time, meant that the further in the past the smaller the universe was, until at some finite time in the past all the mass of the universe was concentrated into a single point, a "primeval atom" where and when the fabric of time and space came into existence.&lt;ref&gt;

Starting in 1924, Hubble painstakingly developed a series of distance indicators, the forerunner of the [[cosmic distance ladder]], using the {{convert|100|in|m|adj=on}} [[Hooker telescope]] at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]]. This allowed him to estimate distances to galaxies whose redshifts had already been measured, mostly by Slipher. In 1929 Hubble discovered a correlation between distance and recession velocity—now known as [[Hubble's law]].&lt;ref name="hubble"/&gt;&lt;ref name="christianson"&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s almost every major cosmologist preferred an eternal [[Steady state theory|steady state]] universe, and several complained that the beginning of time implied by the Big Bang imported religious concepts into physics; this objection was later repeated by supporters of the steady state theory.&lt;ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, observations of certain [[globular cluster]]s appeared to indicate that they were about 15&amp;nbsp;billion years old, which [[cosmic age problem|conflicted]] with most then-current estimates of the age of the universe (and indeed with the age measured today).

===Hubble's law and the expansion of space===
{{Main|Hubble's law|Metric expansion of space}}
{{See also|Distance measures (cosmology)|Scale factor (universe)}}
Observations of distant galaxies and [[quasar]]s show that these objects are redshifted—the [[light]] emitted from them has been shifted to longer wavelengths. This can be seen by taking a [[frequency spectrum]] of an object and matching the [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] pattern of [[emission line]]s or [[absorption line]]s corresponding to [[atom]]s of the [[chemical element]]s interacting with the light. These redshifts are [[Homogeneity (physics)|uniformly]] isotropic, distributed evenly among the observed objects in all directions. If the redshift is interpreted as a Doppler shift, the recessional [[velocity]] of the object can be calculated. For some galaxies, it is possible to estimate distances via the [[cosmic distance ladder]]. When the recessional velocities are plotted against these distances, a linear relationship known as Hubble's law is observed:&lt;ref name="hubble" /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;v = H_0D&lt;/math&gt;
where
* &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the recessional [[velocity]] of the [[galaxy]] or other distant object,
* &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]] to the object, and
* &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is [[Hubble's constant]], measured to be {{val|70.4|+1.3|-1.4}} [[kilometres|km]]/[[second|s]]/[[Megaparsec|Mpc]] by the [[WMAP]] probe.&lt;ref name="wmap7year" /&gt;

[[Hubble's law]] has two possible explanations. Either we are at the center of an explosion of galaxies—which is untenable given the [[Copernican principle]]—or the universe is [[Metric expansion of space|uniformly expanding]] everywhere. This universal expansion was predicted from general relativity by Alexander Friedmann in 1922&lt;ref name=af1922 /&gt; and Georges Lemaître in 1927,&lt;ref name=gl1927 /&gt; well before Hubble made his 1929 analysis and observations, and it remains the cornerstone of the Big Bang theory as developed by [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann, Lemaître, Robertson, and Walker]].

The theory requires the relation &lt;math&gt;v = HD&lt;/math&gt; to hold at all times, where &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; is the [[comoving distance]], ''v'' is the [[recessional velocity]], and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; vary as the universe expands (hence we write &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; to denote the present-day Hubble "constant"). For distances much smaller than the size of the [[observable universe]], the Hubble redshift can be thought of as the Doppler shift corresponding to the recession velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. However, the redshift is not a true Doppler shift, but rather the result of the expansion of the universe between the time the light was emitted and the time that it was detected.&lt;ref name="peacock_c3"&gt;Peacock (1999), chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

That [[Metric expansion of space|space is undergoing metric expansion]] is shown by direct observational evidence of the [[Cosmological principle]] and the Copernican principle, which together with Hubble's law have no other explanation. Astronomical redshifts are extremely [[isotropic]] and [[Homogeneity (physics)#Translation invariance|homogeneous]],&lt;ref name="hubble" /&gt; supporting the Cosmological principle that the universe looks the same in all directions, along with much other evidence. If the redshifts were the result of an explosion from a center distant from us, they would not be so similar in different directions.

Measurements of the effects of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position.&lt;ref&gt;

Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable only if the universe is experiencing a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.

In 1964 [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]] serendipitously discovered the cosmic background radiation, an omnidirectional signal in the [[microwave]] band.&lt;ref name="penzias" /&gt; Their discovery provided substantial confirmation of the big-bang predictions by Alpher, Herman and Gamow around 1950. Through the 1970s the radiation was found to be approximately consistent with a black body spectrum in all directions; this spectrum has been redshifted by the expansion of the universe, and today corresponds to approximately 2.725&amp;nbsp;K. This tipped the balance of evidence in favor of the Big Bang model, and Penzias and Wilson were awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1978.

The ''surface of last scattering'' corresponding to emission of the CMB occurs shortly after ''[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]]'', the epoch when neutral hydrogen becomes stable.

In 1989, [[NASA]] launched the [[Cosmic Background Explorer satellite]] (COBE), which made two major advances: in 1990, high-precision spectrum measurements showed that the &lt;abbr title="cosmic microwave background raditation"&gt;CMB&lt;/abbr&gt; frequency spectrum is an almost perfect [[blackbody]] with no deviations at a level of 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and measured a residual temperature of 2.726&amp;nbsp;K (more recent measurements have revised this figure down slightly to 2.7255&amp;nbsp;K); then in 1992, further COBE measurements discovered tiny fluctuations (anisotropies) in the CMB temperature across the sky, at a level of about one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="cobe" /&gt; [[John C. Mather]] and [[George Smoot]] were awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics for their leadership in these results.

During the following decade, CMB anisotropies were further investigated by a large number of ground-based and balloon experiments. In 2000–2001 several experiments, most notably [[BOOMERanG experiment|BOOMERanG]], found the [[shape of the universe]] to be spatially almost flat by measuring the typical angular size (the size on the sky) of the anisotropies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Melchiorri |first=A., et. al. |title=A measurement of Omega from the North American test flight of BOOMERANG |volume=536 |issue=2 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |year=1999 |arxiv=astro-ph/9911445|doi=10.1086/312744 |pmid=10859119 |bibcode=2000ApJ...536L..63M |pages=L63–L66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Bernardis |first=P. |display-authors=etal |title=A Flat Universe from High-Resolution Maps of the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation |pages=955–959 |journal=Nature |volume=404 |issue=6781 |year=2000 |arxiv=

In early 2003, the first results of the [[WMAP|Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) were released, yielding what were at the time the most accurate values for some of the cosmological parameters. The results disproved several specific [[cosmic inflation]] models, but are consistent with the [[inflation theory]] in general.&lt;ref name="wmap1year" /&gt; The [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] space probe was launched in May 2009. Other ground and balloon based [[List of cosmic microwave background experiments|cosmic microwave background experiments]] are ongoing.

===Abundance of primordial elements===
{{Main|Big Bang nucleosynthesis}}
Using the Big Bang model it is possible to calculate the concentration of [[helium-4]], [[helium-3]], deuterium, and [[lithium-7]] in the universe as ratios to the amount of ordinary hydrogen.&lt;ref name = "kolb_c4"/&gt; The relative abundances depend on a single parameter, the ratio of [[photon]]s to baryons. This value can be calculated independently from the detailed structure of [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] fluctuations. The ratios predicted (by mass, not by number) are about 0.25 for &lt;chem&gt;^4He/H&lt;/chem&gt;, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^2H/H&lt;/chem&gt;, about 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^3He/H&lt;/chem&gt; and about 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; for &lt;chem&gt;^7Li/H&lt;/chem&gt;.&lt;ref name="kolb_c4"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The measured abundances all agree at least roughly with those predicted from a single value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally discrepant for &lt;chem&gt;^4He&lt;/chem&gt;, and off by a factor of two for &lt;chem&gt;^7Li&lt;/chem&gt;; in the latter two cases there are substantial [[systematic error|systematic uncertainties]]. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and it is virtually impossible to "tune" the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, there is no obvious reason outside of the Big Bang that, for example, the young universe (i.e., before star formation, as determined by studying matter supposedly free of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]] products) should have more helium than deuterium or more deuterium than &lt;chem&gt;^3He&lt;/chem&gt;, and in constant ratios, too.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"/&gt;{{rp|182–185}}

===Galactic evolution and distribution===
{{Main|Galaxy formation and evolution|Structure formation}}
Detailed observations of the [[Galaxy morphological classification|morphology]] and [[Large-scale structure of the cosmos|distribution]] of galaxies and [[quasars]] are in agreement with the current state of the Big Bang theory. A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang, and since then, larger structures have been forming, such as [[galaxy clusters]] and [[supercluster]]s.&lt;ref name="Bertschinger"/&gt;

Populations of stars have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are observed as they were in the early universe) appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of [[star formation]], galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.&lt;ref name="Bertschinger"&gt;

In 2011, astronomers found what they believe to be pristine clouds of primordial gas by analyzing absorption lines in the spectra of distant quasars. Before this discovery, all other astronomical objects have been observed to contain heavy elements that are formed in stars. These two clouds of gas contain no elements heavier than hydrogen and deuterium.&lt;ref&gt;

===Other lines of evidence===
The age of the universe as estimated from the Hubble expansion and the [[cosmic microwave background radiation|CMB]] is now in good agreement with other estimates using the ages of the oldest stars, both as measured by applying the theory of [[stellar evolution]] to [[globular clusters]] and through [[radiometric dating]] of individual [[Population II]] stars.&lt;ref&gt;

As with any theory, a number of mysteries and problems have arisen as a result of the development of the Big Bang theory. Some of these mysteries and problems have been resolved while others are still outstanding. Proposed solutions to some of the problems in the Big Bang model have revealed new mysteries of their own. For example, the [[horizon problem]], the [[magnetic monopole problem]], and the [[flatness problem]] are most commonly resolved with [[Cosmic inflation|inflationary theory]], but the details of the inflationary universe are still left unresolved and many, including some founders of the theory, say it has been disproven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Earman |first1=John |last2=Mosterín |first2=Jesús |date=March 1999 |title=A Critical Look at Inflationary Cosmology |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=1–49 |doi=10.1086/392675 |jstor=188736}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Baryon asymmetry===
{{Main|Baryon asymmetry}}
It is not yet understood why the universe has more matter than antimatter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Kolb and Turner, chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally assumed that when the universe was young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the [[Sakharov conditions]] must be satisfied. These require that baryon number is not conserved, that [[C-symmetry]] and [[CP-symmetry]] are violated and that the universe depart from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].&lt;ref name="sakharov"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;(Translated in ''[[Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Physics Letters]]'' '''5''', 24 (1967).)
&lt;/ref&gt; All these conditions occur in the [[Standard Model]], but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present baryon asymmetry.

===Dark energy===
{{Main|Dark energy}}
Measurements of the [[redshift]]–[[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] relation for [[type Ia supernova]]e indicate that the expansion of the universe has been [[accelerating universe|accelerating]] since the universe was about half its present age. To explain this acceleration, general relativity requires that much of the energy in the universe consists of a component with large [[equation of state (cosmology)|negative pressure]], dubbed "dark energy".&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt;

Dark energy, though speculative, solves numerous problems. Measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background]] indicate that the universe is very nearly spatially flat, and therefore according to general relativity the universe must have almost exactly the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]] of mass/energy. But the mass density of the universe can be measured from its gravitational clustering, and is found to have only about 30% of the critical density.&lt;ref name="peebles" /&gt; Since theory suggests that dark energy does not cluster in the usual way it is the best explanation for the "missing" energy density. Dark energy also helps to explain two geometrical measures of the overall curvature of the universe, one using the frequency of [[gravitational lens]]es, and the other using the characteristic pattern of the [[large-scale structure of the universe|large-scale structure]] as a cosmic ruler.

Negative pressure is believed to be a property of [[vacuum energy]], but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos.&lt;ref name="wmap7year" /&gt; According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will fall in the [[far future]] as dark energy becomes even more dominant.

The dark energy component of the universe has been explained by theorists using a variety of competing theories including Einstein's [[cosmological constant]] but also extending to more exotic forms of [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] or other modified gravity schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |journal=Particle Data Group 2014 Review of Particle Physics |date=December 2013 |arxiv=1401.0046|bibcode = 2014arXiv1401.0046M }}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mortonson |first1=Michael J. |last2=Weinberg |first2=David H.|last3=White |first3=Martin |title=Dark Energy: A Short Review |work=LEVEL 5 — A Knowledgebase for Extragalactic Astronomy and Cosmology, NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) |publisher=Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology |date=2014-06-27 |url=https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March14/Mortonson/Mortonson_contents.html |accessdate=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[cosmological constant problem]], sometimes called the "most embarrassing problem in physics", results from the apparent discrepancy between the measured energy density of dark energy, and the one naively predicted from [[Planck units]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rugh |first1=S.&amp;thinsp;E. |last2=Zinkernagel |first2=H. |title=The quantum vacuum and the cosmological constant problem |pages=663–705 |volume=33 |issue=4 |date=December 2002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1355219802000333 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Science Part B |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(02)00033-3 |arxiv=hep-th/0012253|bibcode = 2002SHPMP..33..663R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dark matter===
{{Main|Dark matter}}
[[File:Cosmological Composition – Pie Chart.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5|[[pie chart|Chart]] shows the proportion of different components of the universe {{spaced ndash}} about 95% is [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].]]
During the 1970s and the 1980s, various observations showed that there is not sufficient visible matter in the universe to account for the apparent strength of gravitational forces within and between galaxies. This led to the idea that up to 90% of the matter in the universe is dark matter that does not emit light or interact with normal [[baryon]]ic matter. In addition, the assumption that the universe is mostly normal matter led to predictions that were strongly inconsistent with observations. In particular, the universe today is far more lumpy and contains far less deuterium than can be accounted for without dark matter. While dark matter has always been controversial, it is inferred by various observations: the anisotropies in the CMB, [[galaxy cluster]] velocity dispersions, large-scale structure distributions, [[gravitational lensing]] studies, and [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray measurements]] of galaxy clusters.&lt;ref&gt;

Indirect evidence for dark matter comes from its gravitational influence on other matter, as no dark matter particles have been observed in laboratories. Many [[particle physics]] candidates for dark matter have been proposed, and several projects to detect them directly are underway.&lt;ref name="pdg"&gt;

===Horizon problem===
The [[horizon problem]] results from the premise that information cannot travel [[faster than light]]. In a universe of finite age this sets a limit—the [[particle horizon]]—on the separation of any two regions of space that are in [[causality (physics)|causal]] contact.&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"&gt;Kolb and Turner (1988), chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt; The observed isotropy of the [[Cosmic microwave background|CMB]] is problematic in this regard: if the universe had been dominated by radiation or matter at all times up to the epoch of last scattering, the particle horizon at that time would correspond to about 2 degrees on the sky. There would then be no mechanism to cause wider regions to have the same temperature.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Sue Ryden|title=Introduction to cosmology|year=2003|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-8053-8912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|191–202}}

A resolution to this apparent inconsistency is offered by [[inflationary theory]] in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on opposite sides of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.&lt;ref name="guth"/&gt;{{rp|180–186}}

[[Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]] predicts that during the inflationary phase there would be [[primordial fluctuations|quantum thermal fluctuations]], which would be magnified to cosmic scale. These fluctuations serve as the seeds of all current structure in the universe.&lt;ref name="Ryden2003"/&gt;{{rp|207}} Inflation predicts that the [[primordial fluctuations]] are nearly [[Scale invariance|scale invariant]] and [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]], which has been accurately confirmed by measurements of the CMB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spergel |first=D.

If inflation occurred, exponential expansion would push large regions of space well beyond our observable horizon.&lt;ref name="guth"/&gt;{{rp|180–186}}

A related issue to the classic horizon problem arises because in most standard cosmological inflation models, inflation ceases well before [[electroweak symmetry breaking]] occurs, so inflation should not be able to prevent large-scale discontinuities in the [[electroweak vacuum]] since distant parts of the observable universe were causally separate when the [[electroweak epoch]] ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R. Penrose|title=The Road to Reality|publisher=Vintage books|year=2007|isbn=978-0-679-77631-4|title-link=The Road to Reality}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic monopoles===
The [[magnetic monopole]] objection was raised in the late 1970s. [[Grand unified theory|Grand unified theories]] predicted [[topological defect]]s in space that would manifest as [[magnetic monopole]]s. These objects would be produced efficiently in the hot early universe, resulting in a density much higher than is consistent with observations, given that no monopoles have been found. This problem is also resolved by [[cosmic inflation]], which removes all point defects from the observable universe, in the same way that it drives the geometry to flatness.&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"/&gt;

===Flatness problem===
[[File:End of universe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The overall [[Shape of the universe|geometry of the universe]] is determined by whether the [[Density parameter|Omega cosmological parameter]] is less than, equal to or greater than 1. Shown from top to bottom are a [[Shape of the universe#Spherical universe|closed universe]] with positive curvature, a [[Shape of the universe#Hyperbolic universe|hyperbolic universe]] with negative curvature and a [[flat universe]] with zero curvature.]]

The [[flatness problem]] (also known as the oldness problem) is an observational problem associated with a [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] (FLRW).&lt;ref name="kolb_c8"/&gt; The universe may have positive, negative, or zero spatial [[curvature]] depending on its total energy density. Curvature is negative if its density is less than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]]; positive if greater; and zero at the critical density, in which case space is said to be ''flat''.

The problem is that any small departure from the critical density grows with time, and yet the universe today remains very close to flat.&lt;ref group="notes"&gt;Strictly, dark energy in the form of a cosmological constant drives the universe towards a flat state; however, our universe remained close to flat for several billion years before the dark energy density became significant.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that a natural timescale for departure from flatness might be the [[Planck time]], 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds,&lt;ref name=HTUW/&gt; the fact that the universe has reached neither a [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] nor a [[Big Crunch]] after billions of years requires an explanation. For instance, even at the relatively late age of a few minutes (the time of nucleosynthesis), the density of the universe must have been within one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; of its critical value, or it would not exist as it does today.&lt;ref&gt;

== Cause ==
{{Main|Problem of why there is anything at all}}
Physics may conclude that [[time]] did not exist before 'Big Bang', but 'started' with the &lt;!--beginning point--&gt;Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause' and instead always existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Big Bang?

== Ultimate fate of the universe ==
{{Main|Ultimate fate of the universe}}

Before observations of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios for the future of the universe. If the mass [[density]] of the universe were greater than the [[Critical density (cosmology)|critical density]], then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin to collapse. It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.&lt;ref name="kolb_c3"/&gt;

Alternatively, if the density in the universe were equal to or below the critical density, the expansion would slow down but never stop. Star formation would cease with the consumption of interstellar gas in each galaxy; stars would burn out, leaving [[white dwarf]]s, [[neutron star]]s, and [[black hole]]s. Very gradually, collisions between these would result in mass accumulating into larger and larger black holes. The average temperature of the universe would asymptotically approach [[absolute zero]]—a [[Big Freeze]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Griswold |first=Britt |title=What is the Ultimate Fate of the Universe? |work=Universe 101 Big Bang Theory |publisher=NASA |date=2012 |url=
http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_fate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, if the proton were [[proton decay|unstable]], then baryonic matter would disappear, leaving only radiation and black holes. Eventually, black holes would evaporate by emitting [[Hawking radiation]]. The [[entropy]] of the universe would increase to the point where no organized form of energy could be extracted from it, a scenario known as heat death.&lt;ref name=dying&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Adams |first1=Fred C. |last2=Laughlin |first2=Gregory |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A dying Universe: the long-term fate and evolution of astrophysical objects |pages=337–372 |journal=Reviews of Modern Physics |volume=69 |issue=2 |date=1997 |bibcode=1997RvMP...69..337A |doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.69.337| arxiv=astro-ph/9701131}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|sec VI.D}}

Modern observations of accelerating expansion imply that more and more of the currently visible universe will pass beyond our [[event horizon]] and out of contact with us. The eventual result is not known. The ΛCDM model of the universe contains dark energy in the form of a [[cosmological constant]]. This theory suggests that only gravitationally bound systems, such as galaxies, will remain together, and they too will be subject to heat death as the universe expands and cools. Other explanations of dark energy, called [[phantom energy]] theories, suggest that ultimately galaxy clusters, stars, planets, atoms, nuclei, and matter itself will be torn apart by the ever-increasing expansion in a so-called [[Big Rip]].&lt;ref&gt;

== Misconceptions ==
The following is a partial list of misconceptions about the Big Bang model:

''The Big Bang as the origin of the universe:'' One of the common misconceptions about the Big Bang model is the belief that it was the origin of the universe. However, the Big Bang model does not comment about how the universe came into being. Current conception of the Big Bang model assumes the existence of energy, time, and space, and does not comment about their origin or the cause of the dense and high temperature initial state of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm|title=Brief Answers to Cosmic Questions|website=www.cfa.harvard.edu|access-date=2017-07-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413195349/https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/faq.htm|archivedate=13 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Big Bang was "small"'': It is misleading to visualize the Big Bang by comparing its size to everyday objects. When the size of the universe at Big Bang is described, it refers to the size of the observable universe, and not the entire universe.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davis|first=Tamara M.|last2=Lineweaver|first2=Charles H.|date=January 2004|title=Expanding Confusion: Common Misconceptions of Cosmological Horizons and the Superluminal Expansion of the Universe|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/publications-of-the-astronomical-society-of-australia/article/expanding-confusion-common-misconceptions-of-cosmological-horizons-and-the-superluminal-expansion-of-the-universe/EFEEEFD8D71E59F86DDA82FDF576EFD3|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia|volume=21|issue=1|pages=97–109|doi=10.1071/as03040|arxiv = astro-ph/0310808 |bibcode = 2004PASA...21...97D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Hubble's law]] violates the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]]'': Hubble's law predicts that galaxies that are beyond [[Hubble's law|Hubble Distance]] recede [[Faster-than-light|faster than the speed of light]]. However, special relativity does not apply beyond motion through space. Hubble's law describes velocity that results from expansion ''of'' space, rather than ''through'' space.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''[[Doppler effect|Doppler redshift]] vs [[Cosmological redshift|cosmological red-shift]]'': Astronomers&amp;nbsp;often refer to the cosmological red-shift as a normal Doppler shift,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;which is a misconception. Although similar, the cosmological red-shift is not identical to the Doppler redshift. The Doppler redshift is based on special relativity, which does not consider the expansion of space. On the contrary, the cosmological red-shift is based on general relativity, in which the expansion of space is considered. Although they may appear identical for nearby galaxies, it may cause confusion if the behavior of distant galaxies is understood through the Doppler redshift.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Speculations ==
{{Main|Cosmogony}}

While the Big Bang model is well established in cosmology, it is likely to be refined. The Big Bang theory, built upon the equations of classical general relativity, indicates a [[essential singularity|singularity]] at the origin of cosmic time; this [[infinity#Physics|infinite]] [[energy density]] is regarded as impossible in [[experimental physics|physics]].  Still, it is known that the equations are not applicable before the time when the universe cooled down to the [[Planck temperature]], and this conclusion depends on various assumptions, of which some could never be experimentally verified. ''(Also see [[Planck epoch]].)''

One proposed refinement to avoid this would-be singularity is to develop a correct treatment of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref&gt;

It is not known what could have preceded the hot dense state of the early universe or how and why it originated, though speculation abounds in the field of [[cosmogony]].

Some proposals, each of which entails untested hypotheses, are:
* Models including the [[Hartle–Hawking state|Hartle–Hawking no-boundary condition]], in which the whole of space-time is finite; the Big Bang does represent the limit of time but without any singularity.&lt;ref&gt;

* Big Bang lattice model, states that the universe at the moment of the Big Bang consists of an infinite lattice of [[fermions]], which is smeared over the [[fundamental domain]] so it has rotational, translational and gauge symmetry. The symmetry is the largest symmetry possible and hence the lowest entropy of any state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* [[Brane cosmology]] models, in which inflation is due to the movement of branes in [[string theory]]; the pre-Big Bang model; the [[ekpyrotic]] model, in which the Big Bang is the result of a collision between branes; and the [[cyclic model]], a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the Big Bang was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Molech babylon.jpg|thumb|500 px|Babylonian [[cylinder seal]] representing child sacrifice]]

'''Child sacrifice''' is the [[ritual]]istic killing of [[child]]ren in order to please or appease a [[god]] or [[supernatural]] beings in order to achieve a desired result. As such, it is a form of [[human sacrifice]]. The practice has received considerable opposition throughout history, and it has often become a target for those engaged in [[criticism of religion]].
Child sacrifice is thought to be an extreme extension of the idea that, the more important the object of sacrifice, the more devout the person giving it up is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Sacrificium.html|title=LacusCurtius • Greek and Roman Sacrifices (Smith's Dictionary, 1875)|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-Columbian cultures==
{{Main|Child sacrifice in pre-Columbian cultures}}

===Aztec culture===
[[File:Aztec ritual for flooding.jpg|thumb|250 px| 1499, the [[Aztecs]] performing child sacrifice to appease the angry gods who had flooded [[Tenochtitlan]]]]
[[Archeologist]]s have found remains of 42 children. It is alleged that these remains were sacrificed to [[Tlaloc]] (and a few to [[Ehécatl]], [[Quetzalcoatl]] and [[Huitzilopochtli]]) in the offerings of the [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan]] by the [[Aztecs]] of pre-Columbian [[Mexico]]. Human sacrifice was an everyday activity in Tenochtitlan and children were not exempt. They, in particular, were offered to Tláloc, the god of rain. Bernardino de Sahagún, a religious man left writings that describe such sacrifices, compiled from the first-hand accounts of natives who had lived in Tenochtitlan in the times before it fell. Hernán Cortés himself also mentioned child sacrifices in his letters to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Carlos I of Spain]].

===Inca culture===
The [[Inca]] culture sacrificed children in a ritual called ''[[qhapaq hucha]]''. Their frozen corpses have been discovered in the [[South America]]n mountaintops. The first of these corpses, a female child who had died from a blow to the skull, was discovered in 1995 by Johan Reinhard.&lt;ref&gt;http://gallery.sjsu.edu/sacrifice/precolumbian.html - "Pre-Columbian Andean Sacrifices"&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods of sacrifice included [[strangulation]] and simply leaving the children, who had been given an intoxicating drink, to lose consciousness in the extreme cold and low-oxygen conditions of the mountaintop, and to die of [[hypothermia]].

=== Maya culture ===
In [[Maya civilization|Maya]] culture, people believed that supernatural beings had power over their lives and this is one reason that child sacrifice occurred.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mortuary Landscapes of the Classic Maya|last=Scherer|first=Andrew|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sacrifices were essentially to satisfy the supernatural beings. This was done through ''k'ex'', which is an exchange or substitution of something.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through ''k’ex'' infants would substitute more powerful humans.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was thought that supernatural beings would consume the souls of more powerful humans and infants were substituted in order to prevent that.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Infants are believed to be good offerings because they have a close connection to the spirit world through [[liminality]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ardren|first=Traci|date=2015|title=Burial and the Social Imaginary of Childhood|url=|journal=Social Identities in the Classic Maya Northern Lowlands: Gender, Age, Memory, and Place|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that parents in Maya culture would offer their children for sacrifice and depictions of this show that this was a very emotional time for the parents, but they would carry through because they thought the child would continue existing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is also known that infant sacrifices occurred at certain times. Child sacrifice was preferred when there was a time of crisis and transitional times such as famine and drought.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There is archaeological evidence of infant sacrifice in tombs where the infant has been buried in urns or ceramic vessels. There have also been depictions of child sacrifice in art. Some art includes pottery and [[stele]]s as well as references to infant sacrifice in mythology and art depictions of the mythology.

===Moche culture===
The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] of northern [[Peru]] practiced mass sacrifices of men and boys.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080506113520/http://www.exn.ca/mummies/story.asp?id=1999041452 – [[Discovery Channel - Archive.org]] article&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timoto-Cuica culture===
The [[Timoto-Cuicas]] offered human sacrifices. Until colonial times children sacrifice persisted secretly in [[Laguna de Urao]] ([[Mérida (state)|Mérida]]). It were described by the chronicler [[Juan de Castellanos]], who cited that feasts and human sacrifices were done in honour of [[Icaque]], an Andean prehispanic goddess.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saber.ula.ve/bitstream/123456789/18495/1/articulo3.pdf De los timoto-cuicas a la invisibilidad del indigena andino y a su diversidad cultural&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://issuu.com/bnahem/docs/revista_digital_timoto_cuicas Timoto-Cuicas&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Near East==

===Tanakh (Hebrew Bible)===
References in the Tanakh point to an awareness of human sacrifice in the history of [[ancient Near Eastern]] practice. The king of [[Moab]] gives his firstborn son and heir as a whole burnt offering (''olah'', as used of the Temple sacrifice). In the book of the prophet [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]], the question is asked, 'Shall I give my firstborn for my sin, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?',&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Micah|6:7|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and responded to in the phrase, 'He has shown all you people what is good. And what does Yahweh require of you? To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.'&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Micah|6:8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tanakh also implies that the [[Ammon (nation)|Ammonites]] offered child sacrifices to [[Moloch]].{{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Leviticus Leviticus 20:2}}

====Ban in Leviticus====
In Leviticus 18:21, 20:3 and Deuteronomy 12:30-31, 18:10, the [[Torah]] contains a number of imprecations against and laws forbidding child sacrifice and human sacrifice in general. The [[Tanakh]] denounces human sacrifice as barbaric customs of [[Baal]] worshippers (e.g. Psalms 106:37).
[[James Kugel]] argues that the Torah's specifically forbidding child sacrifice indicates that it happened in Israel as well.&lt;ref&gt;" It was not just among Israel's neighbors that child sacrifice was countenanced, but apparently within Israel itself. Why else would biblical law specifically forbid such things – and with such vehemence?" However, [[Chananya Goldberg]] argues that such a point is illogical - for if it were to be accepted, one would be forced to assume that, within Israel, people killed, stole and injured with impunity. [[James Kugel]] (2008). ''How to Read the Bible'', p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark S. Smith]] argues that the mention of "Topeth" in Isaiah 30:27–33 indicates an acceptance of child sacrifice in the early Jerusalem practices, to which the law in Leviticus 20:2–5 forbidding child sacrifice is a response.&lt;ref&gt;" Smith also cites Ezekiel 20:25-26 as an example of where Yahweh refers to "the sacrifice of every firstborn". These passages indicate that in the seventh century child sacrifice was a Judean practice performed in the name of YHWH...In Isaiah 30:27-33 there is no offense taken at the tophet, the precinct of child sacrifice. It would appear that the Jerusalemite cult included child sacrifice under Yahwistic patronage; it is this that Leviticus 20:2-5 deplores." [[Mark S. Smith]] (2002). ''The early history of God: Yahweh and the other deities in ancient Israel'', pp. 172–178.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have stated that at least some [[Israelites]] and Judahites believed child sacrifice was a legitimate religious practice.&lt;ref&gt;
*Susan Nidditch (1993). ''War in the Hebrew Bible: A Study in the Ethics of Violence'', Oxford University Press, p. 47. "While there is considerable controversy about the matter, the consensus over the last decade concludes that child sacrifice was a part of ancient Israelite religion to large segments of Israelite communities of various periods." However, no mainstream Jewish sources allow child-sacrifice, even in theory. All mainstream Jewish sources state, or imply, that such an act is abhorrent.
*[[Susan Ackerman (biblical scholar)|Susan Ackerman]] (1992). ''Under Every Green Tree: Popular Religion in Sixth-Century Judah'', Scholars Press, p. 137. "the cult of child sacrifice was felt in some circles to be a legitimate expression of Yawistic faith."
*Francesca Stavrakopoulou (2004). "King Manasseh and Child Sacrifice: Biblical Distortions of Historical Realities', p283. "Though the Hebrew Bible portrays child sacrifice as a foreign practice, several texts indicates that it was a native element of Judahite deity-worship."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Binding of Isaac====
{{main|Binding of Isaac}}
Genesis relates the [[binding of Isaac]], him to present his son, [[Isaac]], as a sacrifice on [[Moriah|Mount Moriah]]. No reason is given within the text. Abraham agrees to this command without arguing. The story ends with an [[angel]] stopping Abraham at the last minute and making Isaac's sacrifice unnecessary by providing a ram, caught in some nearby bushes, to be sacrificed instead. [[Francesca Stavrakopoulou]] has speculated that it is possible that the story "contains traces of a tradition in which Abraham does sacrifice Isaac". Rabbi A.I. Kook, first Chief Rabbi of Israel, stressed that the climax of the story, commanding Abraham not to sacrifice Isaac, is the whole point: to put an end to the ritual of child sacrifice, which contradicts the morality of a perfect and giving (not taking) monotheistic God.&lt;ref&gt;"Olat Reiya", p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Irving Greenberg the story of the [[binding of Isaac]], symbolizes the prohibition to worship God by [[human sacrifices]], at a time when [[human sacrifices]] were the norm worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Greenberg. 1988. The Jewish Way: Living the Holidays. New York : Summit Books. p.195.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gehenna and Tophet====
{{main|Tophet}}
The most extensive accounts of child sacrifice in the Hebrew Bible refer to those carried out in [[Gehenna]] by two kings of Judah, [[Ahaz]] and [[Manasseh]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher B. Hays Death in the Iron Age II &amp; in First Isaiah 2011 p181 "Efforts to show that the Bible does not portray actual child sacrifice in the Molek cult, but rather dedication to the god by fire, have been convincingly disproved. Child sacrifice is well attested in the ancient world, especially in times of crisis."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judges====
{{main|Book of Judges}}
In the [[Book of Judges]], the figure of [[Jephthah]] makes a vow to God, saying, "If you give the Ammonites into my hands, whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when I return in triumph from the Ammonites will be the Lord’s, and I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering" (as worded in the [[New International Version]]). Jephthah succeeds in winning a victory, but when he returns to his home in [[Mizpah in Gilead (Judges)|Mizpah]] he sees his daughter, dancing to the sound of [[timbrel]]s, outside.  After allowing her two months preparation, Judges 11:39 states that Jephthah kept his vow. According to the [[meforshim|commentators of the rabbinic Jewish tradition]], Jepthah's daughter was not sacrificed, but was forbidden to marry and remained a spinster her entire life, fulfilling the vow that she would be devoted to the Lord.&lt;ref name="Radak-MD"&gt;[[David Kimhi|Radak]], [[Book of Judges]] 11:39; ''Metzudas Dovid'' ibid&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st-century CE Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]], however, understood this to mean that Jephthah burned his daughter on Yahweh's altar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brenner|first=Athalya|author-link=Athalya Brenner|title=Judges: a feminist companion to the Bible|year=1999|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84127-024-1|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=De4itoIYD9oC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=josephus++Jephthah++++burned++daughter+altar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Yg_6TtiIKI-68gOVray9AQ&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=josephus%20%20Jephthah%20%20%20%20burned%20%20daughter%20altar&amp;f=false|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst [[pseudo-Philo]], late first century CE, wrote that Jephthah offered his daughter as a burnt offering because he could find no sage in Israel who would cancel his vow. In other words, this story of human sacrifice is not an order or requirement by God, but the punishment for those who vowed to sacrifice humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women's Bible Commentary|author1=Carol Ann Newsom |author2=Sharon H. Ringe |author3=Jacqueline E. Lapsley |page=133|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=8274|title=הפולמוס העקיף בנושא העלאת קורבן אדם : בת יפתח (שופטים יא 40-29)|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phoenicia and Carthage===
{{See also|Religion in Carthage}}
Neighbors criticized Carthage for their child sacrifice practices. [[Plutarch]] (ca. 46–120 AD), [[Tertullian]], [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]], and [[Diodorus Siculus]] mention this practice; however, [[Livy]] and [[Polybius]] do not. The ancestors of Carthage, Canaanites, were also mentioned performing child sacrifices in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and by some Israelites, at a place called the [[Tophet]] ("roasting place").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theancientworld.net/civ/carthage_culture.html|title=The Carthaginians - Culture|website=www.theancientworld.net|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these sources suggest that babies were roasted to death on a heated bronze statue. According to Diodorus Siculus, "There was in their city a bronze image of Cronus extending its hands, palms up and sloping toward the ground, so that each of the children when placed thereon rolled down and fell into a sort of gaping pit filled with fire."(Bib. Hist. 20.14.6)

Sites within [[Carthage]] and other [[Phoenicia]]n centers revealed the remains of young children in large numbers; some historians{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} interpret this as evidence for frequent and prominent child sacrifice to the god [[Baal-hamon]].

The accuracy of such stories is disputed by some modern historians and archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05146/510878.stm Carthage tries to live down image as site of infanticide&lt;/ref&gt;  At Carthage a large cemetery exists that combines the bodies of both very young children and small animals, and those who assert child sacrifice have argued that if the animals were sacrificed, then so too were the children.&lt;ref name="plosone.org"&gt;Skeletal Remains from Punic Carthage Do Not Support Systematic Sacrifice of Infants http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0009177&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent archaeology however, has produced a detailed breakdown of the ages of the buried children and, based on this and especially on the presence of prenatal individuals – that is, [[still birth]]s – it is also argued that this site is consistent with burials of children who had died of natural causes in a society that had a high [[infant mortality rate]], as Carthage is assumed to have had. That is, the data support the view that Tophets were cemeteries for those who died shortly before or after birth, regardless of the cause of death.&lt;ref name="plosone.org"/&gt;

Greek, Roman and Israelite writers refer to Phoenician child sacrifice. However, some historians have disputed this interpretation, suggesting instead that these were resting places for children miscarried or who died in infancy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Skeptics suggest that the bodies of children found in Carthaginian and Phoenician cemeteries were merely the cremated remains of children that died naturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GUfAW0dEcrQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Phoenicians&amp;cd=7#v=onepage&amp;q=child%20sacrifice&amp;f=false|title=The Phoenicians|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sergio Ribichini has argued that the Tophet was "a child necropolis designed to receive the remains of infants who had died prematurely of sickness or other natural causes, and who for this reason were "offered" to specific deities and buried in a place different from the one reserved for the ordinary dead".&lt;ref&gt;Sergio Ribichini, "Beliefs and Religious Life" in Moscati, Sabatino (ed), ''The Phoenicians'', 1988, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; The few Carthaginian texts which have survived make absolutely no mention of child sacrifice, though most of them pertain to matters entirely unrelated to religion, such as the practice of agriculture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

According to Stager and Wolff, in 1984, there was a consensus among scholars that Carthaginian children were sacrificed by their parents, who would make a vow to kill the next child if the gods would grant them a favor: for instance that their shipment of goods were to arrive safely in a foreign port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{cquote|the lady Tanit ...&amp;nbsp;. The hands of the statue extended over a brazier into which the child fell once the flames had caused the limbs to contract and its mouth to open ...&amp;nbsp;.

Later commentators have compared the accounts of child sacrifice in the Old Testament with similar ones from Greek and Latin sources speaking of the offering of children by fire as sacrifices in the [[Punic]] city of [[Carthage]], which was a Phoenician colony. [[Cleitarchus]] in his "Scholia" of Plato's Republic mentions the practice:

{{cquote|There stands in their midst a bronze statue of Kronos, its hands extended over a bronze brazier, the flames of which engulf the child. When the flames fall upon the body, the limbs contract and the open mouth seems almost to be laughing until the contracted body slips quietly into the brazier. Thus it is that the ‘grin’ is known as ‘[[Sardonicism|sardonic laughter]],’ since they die laughing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| title = Child Sacrifice in Canaanite and Israelite Religion

| pages = 22}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This reference also seems to clarify that the statue itself was not made to move by the flames, but rather the burnt and shriveled body of the victim was contorted by them.

[[Diodorus Siculus]] too references this practice:

{{cquote|[[Himilcar]], on seeing how the throng was beset with superstitious fear, first of all put a stop to the destruction of the monuments, and then he supplicated the gods after the custom of his people by sacrificing a young boy to Cronus and a multitude of cattle to Poseidon by drowning them in the sea [...] in former times they had been accustomed to sacrifice to this god the noblest of their sons, but more recently, secretly buying and nurturing children, they had sent these to the sacrifice.&lt;ref name="roger-pearse.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roger-pearse.com/weblog/2012/05/31/sacrifices-of-children-at-carthage-the-sources/|title=Sacrifices of children at Carthage – the sources at Roger Pearse|work=Roger Pearse|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Plutarch]] in ''De superstitione'' also mentions the practice in Carthage:
{{cquote|they themselves offered up their own children, and those who had no children would buy little ones from poor people and cut their throats as if they were so many lambs or young birds.&lt;ref name="roger-pearse.com"/&gt;}}

These all mention the burning of children as offerings to [[Cronus]] or [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]], that is to [[Ba`al Hammon|Ba'al Hammon]], the chief god of Carthage (see [[Interpretatio graeca|Interpretatio Graeca and Interpretatio Romana]] for clarification).

Claims concerning Moloch and child sacrifice may have been made for negative-propaganda effect.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The Romans and Israelites describe child sacrifice as a practice of their "evil" enemies. Some scholars think that, after the Romans finally defeated Carthage and totally destroyed the city, they engaged in postwar propaganda to make their arch-enemies seem cruel and less civilized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dakotascba.com/Archaeology-3.php|title=Dakotas CB Arena|publisher=|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question of whether Phoenician child sacrifice was real or a myth continues to be discussed in academic circles, including the work of [[M'hamed Hassine Fantar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSAO&amp;Volume=3&amp;Issue=6&amp;ArticleID=11|title=Were living Children Sacrificed to the Gods?

The [[Minoan civilization]], located in ancient [[Crete]], is widely accepted as the first civilization in [[Europe]].

The murder of children for body parts with which to make muti, for purposes of witchcraft, still occurs in South Africa. [[Muti murders]] occur throughout South Africa, especially in rural areas.

In the early 21st century Uganda has experienced a revival of child sacrifice. In spite of government attempts to downplay the issue, an investigation by the [[BBC]] into human sacrifice in [[Uganda]] found that ritual killings of children are more common than Ugandan authorities admit.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tim Whewell]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8441813.stm "Witch-doctors reveal extent of child sacrifice in Uganda"], BBC News, 7 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; There are many indicators that politicians and politically connected wealthy businessmen are involved in sacrificing children in practice of traditional religion, which has become a commercial enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Chris 2011.

A '''cognitive distortion''' is an exaggerated or irrational thought pattern involved in the onset and perpetuation of [[psychopathological]] states, especially those more influenced by psychosocial factors, such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helmond|first=Petra|last2=Overbeek|first2=Geertjan|last3=Brugman|first3=Daniel|last4=Gibbs|first4=John C.|title=A Meta-Analysis on Cognitive Distortions and Externalizing Problem Behavior|url=https://dx.doi.org.erl.lib.byu.edu/10.1177/0093854814552842|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|language=en|volume=42|issue=3|pages=245–262|doi=10.1177/0093854814552842}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist [[Aaron T. Beck]] laid the groundwork for the study of these distortions, and his student [[David D. Burns]] continued research on the topic. Burns, in ''[[The Feeling Good Handbook]]''&lt;ref name="burns"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=David D. |title=The Feeling Good Handbook: Using the New Mood Therapy in Everyday Life |location=New York |publisher=W. Morrow |year=1989 |isbn=0-688-01745-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1989), described personal and professional anecdotes related to cognitive distortions and their elimination.

Cognitive distortions are thoughts that cause individuals to perceive reality inaccurately. According to the cognitive model of Beck, a negative outlook on reality, sometimes called ''negative schemas'' (or ''schemata''), is a factor in symptoms of emotional dysfunction and poorer subjective well-being. Specifically, negative thinking patterns cause negative emotions.&lt;ref name="grohol"&gt;{{cite web|last=Grohol |first=John |date=2009 |title=15 Common Cognitive Distortions |url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/2009/15-common-cognitive-distortions/ |publisher=PsychCentral |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707124344/http://psychcentral.com/lib/2009/15-common-cognitive-distortions/ |archivedate=2009-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During difficult circumstances, these distorted thoughts can contribute to an overall negative outlook on the world and a depressive or anxious mental state.

Challenging and changing cognitive distortions is a key element of [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)]].

== History ==
In 1972, psychiatrist, psychoanalyst, and [[cognitive therapy]] scholar Aaron T. Beck published ''Depression: Causes and Treatment.''&lt;ref name="beck"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Aaron T. |title=Depression; Causes and Treatment |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=1972 |isbn=0-8122-7652-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was dissatisfied with the conventional Freudian treatment of [[Depression (mood)|depression]], because there was no empirical evidence for the success of Freudian [[psychoanalysis]]. Beck's book provided a comprehensive and empirically supported theoretical model for depression — its potential causes, symptoms, and treatments. In Chapter 2, titled "Symptomatology of Depression," he described “cognitive manifestations” of depression, including low self-evaluation, negative expectations, self-blame and self-criticism, indecisiveness, and distortion of the body image.&lt;ref name="beck" /&gt;

In 1980 Burns published ''Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy''&lt;ref name="burns2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=David D. |title=Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy |location=New York |publisher=Morrow |year=1980 |isbn=0-688-03633-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (with a preface by Beck), and nine years later ''The Feeling Good Handbook'', both of which built on Beck's work.

== Main types ==
[[File:Common Cognitive Biases.png|thumb|400px|Examples of some common cognitive distortions seen in depressed and anxious individuals. People may be taught how to identify and alter these distortions as part of [[Cognitive Behavioural Therapy]].]]
The cognitive distortions listed below&lt;ref name="burns" /&gt; are categories of automatic thinking, and are to be distinguished from [[logical fallacy|logical fallacies]].&lt;ref name="tagg"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://daphne.palomar.edu/jtagg/cds.htm#cogdis |title=Cognitive Distortions |first=John |last=Tagg |year=1996 |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Always being right===
Being wrong is unthinkable. This cognitive distortion is characterized by actively trying to prove one's actions or thoughts to be correct, and sometimes prioritizing [[self-interest]] over the feelings of another person.&lt;ref name="grohol" /&gt;

=== Blaming ===
{{Main|Blaming}}
The opposite of ''personalization''; holding other people responsible for the harm they cause, and especially for their [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|intentional]] or [[negligent infliction of emotional distress]].&lt;ref name="grohol" /&gt;

:: Example: someone blames one's spouse entirely for marital problems, instead of looking at one's own part in the problems.

=== Disqualifying the positive===
Discounting positive events.
* Example: Upon receiving congratulations, a person dismisses them out-of-hand, believing them to be undeserved, and automatically interpreting the compliment as an attempt at flattery or as arising out of naïveté.

=== Emotional reasoning ===
{{Main|Emotional reasoning}}
Presuming that negative feelings expose the true nature of things and experiencing reality as a reflection of emotionally linked thoughts. Thinking something is true, solely based on a feeling.
* Example: "I feel (i.e., think that I am) stupid or boring, therefore I must be"&lt;ref name="grohol" /&gt;  feeling that fear of flying in planes means planes are a very dangerous way to travel, or concluding that it's hopeless to clean one's house due to being overwhelmed by the prospect of cleaning.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

===Fallacy of change===
Relying on [[social control]] to obtain cooperative actions from another person.&lt;ref name="grohol" /&gt;

===Fallacy of fairness===
This is the belief that life should be fair and produces upset or angry emotions when life is perceived as failing to be fair and breaking rules to even the playing field that leads to long term ramifications.&lt;ref name="grohol" /&gt;

=== Mental filtering ===
Focusing entirely on negative elements of a situation to the exclusion of the positive. Also, the brain's tendency to filter information that does not conform to already-held beliefs.
* Example: After receiving comments about a work presentation, a person focuses on the single critical comment and ignores what went well.

=== Jumping to conclusions ===
{{Main|Jumping to conclusions}}
Reaching preliminary conclusions (usually negative) with little (if any) evidence. Two specific subtypes are identified:
* '''[[Telepathy|Mind reading]]''': [[Inference|Inferring]] a person's possible or probable (usually negative) thoughts from his or her [[behavior]] and [[nonverbal communication]]; taking precautions against the worst suspected case without asking the person.
** Example: A student assumes that the readers of his or her paper have already made up their minds concerning its topic, and, therefore, writing the paper is a pointless exercise.&lt;ref name="tagg" /&gt;
* '''[[Fortune-telling]]''': predicting outcomes (usually negative) of events.
** Example: Being convinced of failure before a test, when the student is in fact prepared.

=== Labeling and mislabeling ===
{{Main|Labeling theory}}
A form of overgeneralization; attributing a person's actions to his or her character instead of to an attribute. Rather than assuming the behavior to be accidental or otherwise extrinsic, one assigns a label to someone or something that is based on the inferred character of that person or thing.

* Example of labeling: Instead of believing that you made a mistake, you believe that you are a loser, because only a loser would make that kind of mistake. Or, someone who made a bad first impression considers himself or herself a "jerk", regardless of alternative, extrinsic factors.
* Example of mislabeling: A woman who places her children in a day care center is thought to be "abandoning her children to strangers," because she has violated the bond between mother and child.

=== Magnification and minimization ===
{{Main|Exaggeration|Minimisation (psychology)}}
Giving proportionally greater weight to a perceived failure, weakness or threat, or lesser weight to a perceived success, strength or opportunity, so that the weight differs from that assigned by others, such as "[[make a mountain out of a molehill|making a mountain out of a molehill]]". In depressed clients, often the positive characteristics of ''other people'' are exaggerated and their negative characteristics are understated.
* '''[[Catastrophizing]]''' – Giving greater weight to the worst possible outcome, however unlikely, or experiencing a situation as unbearable or impossible when it is just uncomfortable.
* Example: A teenager is too afraid to start driver's training because he believes he would get himself into an accident.

=== Overgeneralizing ===
Making [[hasty generalization]]s from insufficient evidence. Drawing a very broad conclusion from a single incident or a single piece of evidence. Even if something bad happens only once, it is expected to happen over and over again.&lt;ref name="grohol" /&gt;
* Example: A woman is lonely and often spends most of her time at home. Her friends sometimes ask her to dinner and to meet new people. She feels it is useless to even try. No one really could like her.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schimelpfening|first=Nancy|title=You Are What You Think|url=http://depression.about.com/cs/psychotherapy/a/cognitive.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personalizing ===
[[Attribution (psychology)|Attributing]] personal responsibility, including the resulting praise or blame, to events over which the person has [[illusion of control|no control]].
* Example: A mother whose child is struggling in school blames herself for being a bad mother, because she believes that her deficient parenting is responsible for her child's issues. In fact, the real cause may be something else entirely.

=== Making "must" or "should" statements ===
[[Rational emotive behavior therapy#Core beliefs that disturb humans|Making 'must' or should' statements]] was included by [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] in his [[Rational emotive behavior therapy|rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT)]], an early form of CBT; he termed it "musturbation". Michael C. Graham called it "expecting the world to be different than it is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=Michael C.|title=Facts of Life: ten issues of contentment|date=2014|publisher=Outskirts Press|isbn=978-1-4787-2259-5|pages=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be seen as demanding particular achievements or behaviours regardless of the realistic circumstances of the situation. 
* Example: After a performance, a concert pianist believes he or she should not have made so many mistakes.&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;
* In ''Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy'', David Burns clearly distinguished between pathological "should statements", moral imperatives, and social norms.

A related cognitive distortion, also present in Ellis [[Rational emotive behavior therapy|REBT]], is a tendency to [[Rational emotive behavior therapy#Core beliefs that disturb humans|'awfulize']]; to say a future scenario will be 'awful', rather than to realistically appraise the various negative and positive characteristics of that scenario.

=== Splitting (All-or-nothing thinking, black-or-white thinking, dichotomous reasoning)===
{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}
Evaluating the self, as well as events in life in extreme terms. It's either all good or all bad, either black or white, nothing in between. Even small imperfections seem incredibly dangerous and painful.
Splitting involves using terms like "always", "every" or "never" when they are false and misleading.

* Example: When an admired person makes a minor mistake, she or he renders the admiration as contempt.

== Cognitive restructuring ==
[[Cognitive restructuring]] (CR) is a popular form of therapy used to identify and reject maladaptive cognitive distortions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gil|first=Pedro J. Moreno|date=2001|title=Effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural treatment in social phobia: A meta-analytic review.|url=|journal=Psychology in Spain|volume=5|pages=17–25|via=Dialnet}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is typically used with individuals diagnosed with depression.&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ryan C. |last=Martin |first2=Eric R. |last2=Dahlen |title=Cognitive emotion regulation in the prediction of depression, anxiety, stress, and anger |journal=Personality and Individual Differences |year=2005 |volume=39 |issue=7 |pages=1249–1260 |doi=10.1016/j.paid.2005.06.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In CR, the therapist and client first examine a stressful event or situation reported by the client. For example, a depressed male college student who experiences difficulty in dating might believe that his "worthlessness" causes women to reject him. Together, therapist and client might then create a more realistic cognition, e.g., "It is within my control to ask girls on dates. However, even though there are some things I can do to influence their decisions, whether or not they say yes is largely out of my control. Thus, I am not responsible if they decline my invitation." CR therapies are designed to eliminate "automatic thoughts" that include clients' dysfunctional or negative views. According to Beck, doing so reduces feelings of worthlessness, anxiety, and anhedonia that are symptomatic of several forms of mental illness.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/830807378|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5.|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|others=American Psychiatric Association., American Psychiatric Association. DSM-5 Task Force.|isbn=9780890425541|edition= 5th|location=Arlington, VA|oclc=830807378}}&lt;/ref&gt; CR is the main component of Beck's and Burns's [[cognitive behavioral therapy]].&lt;ref name="CBT"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rush |first=A. |first2=M. |last2=Khatami |last3=Beck |first3=A. |title=Cognitive and Behavior Therapy in Chronic Depression |journal=Behavior Therapy |volume=6 |issue=3 |year=1975 |pages=398–404 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(75)80116-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Narcissistic defense ==
{{Main|Narcissistic defences}}
Those diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder tend to view themselves as unrealistically superior and overemphasize their strengths but understate their weaknesses.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; As such, narcissists use [[exaggeration]] and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]] to defend against psychic pain.&lt;ref name=millon2&gt;{{cite book

== Decatastrophizing ==
{{Main|Decatastrophizing}}
In [[cognitive therapy]], decatastrophizing or decatastrophization is a [[cognitive restructuring]] technique that may be used to treat cognitive distortions, such as magnification and catastrophizing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theunissen|first=Maurice|last2=Peters|first2=Madelon L.|last3=Bruce|first3=Julie|last4=Gramke|first4=Hans-Fritz|last5=Marcus|first5=Marco A.|title=Preoperative Anxiety and Catastrophizing|url=https://dx.doi.org.erl.lib.byu.edu/10.1097/AJP.0b013e31824549d6|journal=The Clinical Journal oF Pain|language=en|volume=28|issue=9|pages=819–841|doi=10.1097/ajp.0b013e31824549d6}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly seen in psychological disorders like [[anxiety]]&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt; and [[psychosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005791611000267 |title=Persecutory delusions and catastrophic worry in psychosis: Developing the understanding of delusion distress and persistence |journal=Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry |volume=42 |issue=September 2011 |pages=349–354 |doi=10.1016/j.jbtep.2011.02.003|year=2011 |last1=Moritz |first1=Steffen |last2=Schilling |first2=Lisa |last3=Wingenfeld |first3=Katja |last4=Köther |first4=Ulf |last5=Wittekind |first5=Charlotte |last6=Terfehr |first6=Kirsten |last7=Spitzer |first7=Carsten }}&lt;/ref&gt; Major features of these disorders are the subjective report of being overwhelmed by life circumstances and the incapability of affecting them. The following statements are typical:

* "This is too much work for me to do. I can't finish it before the deadline and my boss will fire me!"
* "I'll never make it into the college I want. My parents and school advisers point out that I have a good GPA, plenty of extracurricular activities that I participated in, and a solid SAT score, but my ACT score was just awful."
* "The boy I went on a date with last night hasn't called me back yet. I'm sure he hates me. I'll never get married."

The goal of CR would be to help the client change his or her perceptions so as to render the felt experience as less significant. In the first example, the client's reported incapability would be reframed so that, although perhaps not all the work will be done by the deadline, the employee's sustained effort will make it unlikely that the boss will fire him or her.

== Criticism ==
{{main|Cognitive behavioral therapy#Criticisms}}
Common criticisms of the diagnosis of cognitive distortion relate to [[epistemology]] and the theoretical basis. The implicit assumption behind the diagnosis is that the therapist is infallible and that only the [[world view]] of the therapist is correct. If the perceptions of the patient differ from those of the therapist, it may not be because of intellectual malfunctions but because the patient has different experiences. Critics claim that there is no evidence that patients suffering from e.g. depression have dysfunctional cognitive abilities. Actually, some depressed subjects appear to be “sadder but wiser”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Beidel |first1=Deborah C. |title=A Critique of the Theoretical Bases of Cognitive Behavioral Theories and Therapy |journal=Clinical Psychology Review |date=1986 |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=177–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the fictional device|other uses|Cone of Silence (disambiguation)}}
[[File:Get Smart-Cone-of-silence.jpg|thumb|right|Cone of Silence from Episode 1 ("[[Mr. Big (Get Smart)|Mr. Big]]", 1965) of ''[[Get Smart]]'']]

The '''Cone of Silence''' is one of many recurring joke devices from ''[[Get Smart]]'', an American [[comedy]] television series of the 1960s about an inept [[spy]].  The essence of the joke is that the apparatus, designed for secret conversations, makes it impossible for those inside the device – and easy for those outside the device – to hear the conversation. The end result being neither secret nor communication.

In popular culture, "cone of silence" is a slang phrase meaning that the speaker wishes to keep the indicated information secret and that the conversation should not be repeated to anyone not currently present. For example: "We aren't inviting Cindy and her boyfriend to the movies because they embarrass us, but keep that in the cone of silence."

==History==

===Precursors===
Although popularized by ''Get Smart'', the term  "Cone of Silence" actually originated on the syndicated TV show ''[[Science Fiction Theatre]]'', in an episode titled "Barrier of Silence" written by Lou Huston and first airing September 3, 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ctva.biz/US/SciFi/ScienceFictionTheatre_01_(1955-56).htm|title=CTVA US Sci-Fi – "Science Fiction Theatre" (ZIV/Syndicated) Season 1 (1955–56)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story focuses on finding a cure for Professor Richard Sheldon, who had been returned to the United States in a confused, altered state of mind after abduction by enemy agents while visiting Milan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/science-fiction-theatre/barrier-of-silence-126781/|title=Science Fiction Theatre – Season 1, Episode 19: Barrier of Silence – TV.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|work=TV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists discover that placing Sheldon in an environment of total silence had been the means of [[brainwashing]], a precursor to later ideas of [[sensory deprivation]], celebrated in such films as ''[[Altered States]]'' and sundry spy thrillers. Sheldon is placed on a chair in the "Cone of Silence", which consists of a raised circular platform suspended by three wires tied to a common vertex. Although the cone's surface is open, noise canceling sound generators located just below the vertex shroud anyone sitting inside in a complete silence impossible in natural surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x24z83k_science-fiction-theatre-19-barrier-of-silence_tv|title=''Science Fiction Theatre'' 19 – 'Barrier Of Silence'|work=Dailymotion}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also demonstrated that anyone speaking inside the cone could not be heard outside, which was the feature later [[parody|parodied]] in ''Get Smart''. Only a speculative, "[[science fiction]]" possibility at that time, such technology is now commonplace in [[active noise control|active noise canceling]] electronics for personal and industrial use.

The concept is also explored in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1950 short story "[[Silence Please]]", which features a device capable of cancelling sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Silence Please' by Arthur C. Clarke|url=http://alienterritory.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/silence-please-by-arthur-c-clarke/|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Frank Herbert]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''—first serialized in ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Analog]]'' from 1963 to 1965 and then published independently in August 1965—the [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Harkonnen]] employs a "[[cone of silence (Dune)|cone of silence]]" when having a private discussion with [[Hasimir Fenring|Count Fenring]]. In the novel's glossary, Herbert describes the device as the sound-deadening "field of a distorter that limits the carrying power of the voice or any other vibrator by damping the vibrations with an image-vibration 180 degrees out of phase".&lt;ref name="Dune Terminology"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Frank Herbert |last=Herbert |first=Frank |year=1965 |title=[[Dune (novel)|Dune]] |chapter=Terminology of the Imperium}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used for privacy, the field does not visually obscure lip movement.&lt;ref name="Dune"&gt;{{cite book |last=Herbert |first=Frank |year=1965 |title=Dune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbert had previously mentioned the cone of silence, on a much smaller scale, in his 1955 short story "Cease Fire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum%3D90 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824011029/http://www.technovelgy.com/ct/content.asp?Bnum=90 |archivedate=2011-08-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Get Smart''===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
The larger, plastic version of the "Cone of Silence", appeared in the pilot episode of ''Get Smart'', entitled "[[Mr. Big (Get Smart)|Mr. Big]]", which aired on September 18, 1965. [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Buck Henry]], the original [[screenwriter]]s for the series, devised many of the [[running joke]]s. Henry either borrowed or independently came up with the Cone of Silence concept, which debuted in the pilot along with other show standards, like Fang, the improperly trained dog-agent, and Max's shoe phone. The Cone of Silence scene was shot ahead of the rest of the pilot episode, and was used to sell the series to [[NBC]].

Cones of Silence appear in ''[[The Nude Bomb]]'' (1980), the first attempt at a theatrical ''Get Smart'' movie. Max, the Chief, and the delegates all have their own cone placed over them. Neither the characters nor the audience hear what is being said. In the later sequel movie, ''[[Get Smart, Again!]]'' (1989), when Maxwell is reactivated as a secret agent, he insists on following protocol to ensure secrecy by using the Cone of Silence. However, the device is considered to be completely outdated (however Max and 99 still have one at home), and the current methods used were the following:

* Hover Cover: The participants converse on the roof of a building while helicopters hover nearby, drowning out all sounds with their rotor blades, thereby preventing anyone from eavesdropping. However, this also prevents those involved from hearing their own words and the intense winds caused by the helicopter's blades throws the participants about.
* Hall of Hush: A chamber with sound-suppressing walls that allow a person's words to appear in front of him like subtitles in a movie. The problem with this device is that the words do not disappear and will eventually fill up the chamber, smothering the speakers in their own dialogues.

A new version of the Cone of Silence appears in the 2008 ''[[Get Smart (film)|Get Smart]]'' film.  One of the early versions of the Cone used in the television series is on display in the CONTROL museum seen in the beginning of the film. The new version has an appearance more consistent with the cones of silence used in ''The Nude Bomb'' than in the television series. It was apparently constructed by the lab guys Bruce and Lloyd, and was untested at the time it was used. It seems much more high-tech, being a small handheld device which, when the button is pressed, creates a cone-shaped beam of light shining down from the ceiling, forming a [[force shield|force field]] around the person highlighted. This field ought to block all exterior sound, making external communication all but impossible. However, as usual, this updated version is ineffective. The force field was shown to be solid, though, to the point where a panicking Larrabee found he could not escape, to the cause of his greater panic. When Max himself attempts to use the device to hide his glee at being named field agent, it malfunctions and does not even raise the field, permitting everybody to hear his embarrassing shouts. However, in fairness to the manufacturers, this was because Max didn't push the button hard enough.

== Variations and related devices==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Throughout the five seasons of ''Get Smart'', the Cone of Silence appears many times. For security reasons, Maxwell Smart insists upon using it to discuss his case. Despite this, its use is always counterproductive in some way:
* During the first episode of the show, the Cone of Silence is lowered. Once it's in place, Max and the Chief can barely hear each other. The frustrated Chief then asks Hodgkins (a CONTROL scientist) to raise it, but Hodgkins can't hear him either.
* The Cone of Silence produces a very strong echo that gives both characters a headache.
* In perhaps one of the most comical moments involving the Cone of Silence, the Chief and Max can't hear each other.  Hodgkins, outside the Cone, can hear them perfectly and acts as a relay between the two.
* After the Cone of Silence is lowered, it randomly raises and lowers.  As Max and the Chief stand and sit to accommodate it, the Cone finally goes so low that it breaks through the Chief's desk, forcing them both to sit on the floor.
* In an episode where Max is asked to investigate KAOS headquarters, the Chief asks him what he found out, he once again insists upon the Cone of Silence, and the Chief reluctantly agrees. When it is lowered Max says he found out nothing, leaving the Chief highly frustrated. This is one of the few occasions where the Cone of Silence itself did not malfunction. Instead, its use was completely unnecessary.
* Another episode involves Max and the Chief using cards with words written on them to communicate. Max made a mistake at one point: The card that reads 99 was upside-down. The Chief responds with "Who is 66?"
* Max insists on lowering the cone of silence to discuss something top secret. Once lowered, he asks the Chief to borrow twenty dollars, frustrating the Chief. When the Chief says that he can't believe that, Max says "Would you believe, thirty dollars". After the Chief insists on raising it, Max reveals that the controls are on the outside, and when slipping out of it, 99 rings the doorbell, and Max forgets about the Chief, who is yelling and gesticulating – inaudibly, within the Cone.

The series also employs related technology:
* Closet of Silence: In one episode, when the Cone of Silence is not working, Max insists on using the "Closet of Silence". In the Closet, there are so many coats and jackets, they can barely hear each other, and cannot get out of the Closet, so Max shoots the lock off, injuring Larabee in the process.
* Portable Cone of Silence: In one episode, when Max and Chief are not in the office, Max brings along a portable Cone of Silence for them to use. This Cone seems to work, as the two can hear each other perfectly. Of course, the audience can hear them too. This cone apparently obscured the Chief's vision, and echoed violently when struck. When they try to take them off, Max succeeds but has to help the chief get his off. He uses his shoe and the butt of his gun, but the Chief finally breaks out after falling off a stage.
* Umbrella of Silence: In one episode, Max, 99 and Chief go to England where they meet the Chief of English CONTROL, who has an Umbrella of Silence which can fit more people in, but the disadvantage is that since the Chief of English CONTROL smokes a lot, he intolerably pollutes the air inside.

The '''Daily Prayer for Peace''' is a spiritual discipline unique to the [[Community of Christ]] and practiced at the [[Independence Temple]] in the church's headquarters campus in [[Independence, Missouri]]. It falls within the most common category of [[Christian prayer]] known as [[supplication]]. 

Each day of the year at 1 p.m. [[Central Time zone|Central Standard Time/Central Daylight Time]] a Daily Prayer for Peace is held as part of a brief worship for that purpose held in the sanctuary of the Independence Temple. The sanctuary is open to the public as members lead a brief worship service that includes the Daily Prayer for Peace. The form of the prayer is a public spoken prayer, usually written by one of the members from somewhere in the world and read aloud either by that member or another person. Each day of the year, the Daily Prayer for Peace is focused on the needs of a different nation of the world. The supplicant prays aloud for peace under the 150-foot dome of the temple spire.

Those living in or visiting Independence, Mo. are encouraged to stop in to participate in this worship experience, and those elsewhere around the globe are encouraged to pause for a moment of silent prayer.

==Background==
At the 1984 [[World Conference (Community of Christ)|World Conference]] of the Community of Christ, its President, [[Wallace B. Smith]], called for the construction of the Independence Temple and its dedication "to the pursuit of peace."

A committee formed to consider the worship ministries to be held in the new temple, devised the idea of a Daily Prayer for Peace to act as a witness of Christ's peace and a "symbol of the Church's unrelenting pursuit of peace." 

The Daily Prayer for Peace has been held daily in the Independence Temple since December 1993. It is one of many practices, including the [[Community of Christ International Peace Award]] that distinguish the denomination and its members.

Prior to 9 April 2007 the Daily Prayer for Peace was held at 12:30 p.m. Central Standard Time/Central Daylight Time. With the change in time those working at Community of Christ International Headquarters are encouraged to pause and attend this service.

Since 26 October 2007 each Friday at Noon Eastern Time the Daily Prayer for Peace service is celebrated at the Kirtland Temple Complex as the Friday Prayer for Peace. Starting in May 2008 it started being celebrated daily in both Independence and Kirtland.

==Order of service==
The committee developed a standard order of service which is normally followed: Gathering in Silence, Call to Prayer, Lighting of Candle, Invitation, Scripture Reading, Prayer for Peace, Prayers of the People, Hymn, Benediction and Postlude. 

==Prayer topics==
In order to ensure a truly global reach for the prayers, a different country is named each day as a  focus  of prayer. The schedule can be seen on the Community of Christ website http://www.cofchrist.org/prayerpeace/. This schedule reflects the ecumenical prayer cycle of the World Council of Churches, which lists  a nation or series of nations for each week of the year.

'''Deistic evolution''' is a position in the [[origins debate]] which involves accepting the [[scientific]] evidence for [[evolution]] and age of the [[universe]] whilst advocating the view that a [[deist]]ic [[God]] created the universe but has not interfered since. The position is a counterpoint to [[theistic evolution]] and is endorsed by those who believe in both [[deism]] and the veracity of science.

==Various views on deistic evolution==

In ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8birAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT398&amp;dq=deistic+evolution&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAWoVChMI2NPFwPLdxgIViBo-Ch1TWwAE#v=onepage&amp;q=deistic%20evolution&amp;f=false Christian Theology]'', by Millard J. Erickson, 2013, is written:

{{quote|Although the term is rarely heard, deistic evolution is perhaps the best way to describe one variety of what is generally called theistic evolution. This is the view that God began the process of evolution, producing the first matter and implanting within the creation the laws its development has followed. Thus, he programmed the process and then withdrew from active involvement with the world, becoming, so to speak, Creator Emeritus. God is the Creator, the ultimate cause, but evolution is the means, the proximate cause. Thus, except for its view of the very beginning of matter, deistic evolution is identical to naturalistic evolution, for it denies that there is any direct activity by a personal God during the ongoing creative process.
Deistic evolution has little difficulty with the scientific data. There is a definite conflict, however, between deism's view of an absentee God and the biblical picture of a God who has been involved in a whole series of creative acts. In particular, both Genesis accounts of the origin of human beings indicate that God definitely and distinctly willed and acted to bring them into existence. In addition, deistic evolution conflicts with the scriptural doctrine of providence, according to which God is personally and intimately concerned with and involved in what is going on in the specific events within his entire creation.}}

The [[psychologist]] Steve Stewart-Williams&lt;ref&gt;[http://psy.swan.ac.uk/staff/stewart-williams/ Homepage for Dr Steve Stewart-Williams]&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life'' (2010) states:

{{cquote|'''Deistic evolutionists hold that God created the universe and the laws of nature... but that once the ball was rolling, he ceased to intervene in the day-today running of the world or in the course of natural law. God was like the ether after Einstein: he no longer had any role to play in the universe'''.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Stewart-Williams ''Darwin, God and the Meaning of Life'' 2010 p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stewart-Williams further writes that deistic evolution strips [[God]] of what most religious believers consider central. Any deistic God is not around for [[prayer]]s, [[miracles]] or to intervene in people's lives and that because of this it is unpopular with [[monotheistic]] religions.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Stewart-Williams, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

Deistic Evolution adheres to the concept of some form of God, but denies any personal God. A recent defender of deistic evolution was [[Michael Anthony Corey]], author of the book ''Back to Darwin: The Scientific Case for Deistic Evolution'' (1994).

Some scholars have written that [[Charles Darwin]] was an advocate of deistic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Christian C. Young, Mark A. Largent ''Evolution and Creationism: A Documentary and Reference Guide'' 2007, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt;

Deistic evolution is similarly the operative idea  in [[Pandeism]], which has been counted amongst the handful of spiritual beliefs which "are compatible with modern [[science]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote=Some of us think that postmodernity represents a similar change of dominant worldviews, one which could turn out to be just as singular as modernity by being a stunning amalgam of James and Weber. If we are correct, then the changed attitudes, assumptions, and values might work together to change ways of life which in turn transform our geographies of mind and being, that is, both the actual physical landscapes and the mental valuescapes we inhabit. One increasingly common outcome of this ongoing transformation, itself a symptom perhaps of post-industrial secular societies, is the movement away from self-denial toward a denial of the supernatural. This development promises to fundamentally alter future geographies of mind and being by shifting the locus of causality from an exalted Godhead to the domain of Nature. How this Nature is ultimately defined has broad repercussions for the, at times, artificial distinction between religious and secular worldviews. For Levine (2011), "secularism is a positive, not a negative, condition, not a denial of the  world of spirit and of religion, but an affirmation of the world we're living in now ... such a world is capable of bringing us to the condition of 'fullness' that religion has always promised" (Levine quoted in Wood 2011). For others, this "fullness" is present in more religious-oriented pantheistic or pandeistic belief systems with, in the latter case, the inclusion of God as the ever unfolding expression of a complex universe with an identifiable beginning but no teleological direction necessarily present.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theistic predeterminism==
Deistic evolution is not the same as [[theistic evolution]], yet they are sometimes confused. The difference rests on the difference between a theistic god that is interested in, if not actively involved in, the outcome of his creation and humanity specifically and a [[deism|deistic god]] that is either disinterested in the outcome, and holds no special place for humanity, or will not intervene. Often, there is no discernible difference between the two positions—the choice of terminology has more to do with the believer and her or his need for a god, than fitting into a mostly arbitrary dictionary or academic definition.

==Criticism from Christian Creationists==

Deistic evolution has been criticised by Christian [[creationists]] as being incompatible with [[Christianity]] since it contradicts a literal reading of the [[Bible]] and more importantly, leaves no role for the "Christian personal God".&lt;ref&gt;James K. A. Smith, Amos Yong ''Science and the Spirit: A Pentecostal Engagement With the Sciences'' p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liberty: a magazine of religious freedom: Volumes 86-88, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

M. J. Erickson wrote that deistic evolution is in conflict with the scriptural doctrine of providence according to which "God is personally and intimately concerned with and involved in what is going on in the specific events within his entire creation."&lt;ref&gt;Erickson M.J., "Christian Theology", 1985, Baker, Grand Rapids, MI, pp. 480-481&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles P. Grannan wrote in 1894, "Another baseless assumption of negative critics is that the general principles of Atheistic and Deistic evolution, admitted by many scientists to account for the origin of the various species of plants and animals, should also be applied to explain the origin of the Christian religion."&lt;ref&gt;"Higher Criticism and the Bible," by Charles P. Grannan, DD, PhD, in ''The American Catholic Quarterly Review'', 1894, Volume 19, Page 577.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Wesley Rishell criticized the concept in 1899, comparing it to the notion (false, in his view), that [[gravity]] was a property of matter instead of a continued action of God:

{{quote|If evolution is God's method of creating he is still at work. Theistic Deism and evolution is possible, but deistic evolution is a contradiction in terms. Again, it is all a mere supposition that God created the world and endowed it with forces which will of necessity work out his will. It is impossible for us to say that God put forth energy in the beginning and then ceased. It is, to say the least, as probable that gravitation is a divine force constantly exerted on matter in a certain way as that it is a divine force deposited in matter once for all.&lt;ref&gt;''The Foundations of the Christian Faith'' by Charles Wesley Rishell, 1899, Page 157.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Science==

Deistic evolution does not oppose or contradict [[evolution]] or come into conflict with [[science]] as it says that a God started the process and then left it to natural processes. However deism is still a religious philosophy.

Stewart-Williams wrote regarding deistic evolution and science:

{{cquote|'''Deistic evolution eliminates any immediate conflict between science and belief in God. Anyone who believes that God's role was merely to create the laws of nature can accept the scientific worldview in its totality; they simply add the proviso that 'God did it' - i.e., that God is responsible for the world that science describes'''.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is considerable room for this "[[god of the gaps]]" view, since scientific observation is entirely unable to shed any light on what happened during the [[Planck epoch]], the earliest 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds in the history of the universe. All development since this initial creative act merely follows laws and principles which He created:

*God created the universe, perhaps using the "big bang" about 15,000 million years ago as his method. He set up basic laws to govern the running of the universe, and then left the scene entirely. God has not been seen since. The earth coalesced about 4 or 5 thousand million years ago without any input from God. Later, elementary life forms formed, which evolved into the animals and plant life that we see today through purely natural forces. It is essentially identical to naturalistic evolution, excepts that it reserves one action for God: that of initially creating the matter of the universe. This belief is common among Deists. [http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_world3.htm]
*Although the term is rarely heard, deistic evolution is perhaps the best way to describe one variety of what is generally called theistic evolution. This is the view that God began the process of evolution, producing the first matter and implanting within the creation the laws which its devel- opment has followed. Thus, he programmed the process. Then he withdrew from active involvement with the world, becoming, so to speak, Creator emeritus. The progress of the created order is free of direct influence by God. He is the Creator of everything, but only the first living form was directly created. All the rest of God's creating has been done indirectly. God is the Creator, the ultimate cause, but evolution is the means, the proximate cause. Thus, except for its view of the very beginning of matter, deistic evolution is identical to naturalistic evolution for it denies that there is any direct activity by a personal God during the ongoing creative process. [http://www.asa3.org/archive/evolution/199505-10/0171.html]

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] disagrees with the doctrine of deistic evolution. In November 2005, Pope Benedict addressed a general audience of 25,000 in [[St. Peter's Square]]:

:When the Pontiff finished his address, he put his papers to one side and commented on the thought of St. Basil the Great, a Doctor of the Church, who said that some, "deceived by the atheism they bear within them, imagined the universe deprived of a guide and order, at the mercy of chance. I believe the words of this fourth-century Father are of amazing timeliness," said Benedict XVI. "How many are these 'some' today? Deceived by atheism, they believe and try to demonstrate that it is scientific to think that everything lacks a guide and order," he continued.

'''Deportation''' is the expulsion of a person or group of people from a place or [[country]]. The term ''expulsion'' is often used as a [[synonym]] for deportation, though expulsion is more often used in the context of [[international law]], while deportation is more used in [[municipal law|national (municipal) law]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-Marie Henckaerts]] in his book 'Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice'' wrote: "As far as deportation is concerned, there is no general feature that clearly sets it apart from expulsion. Both term basically indicate the same phenomenon. [...] The only difference seems to be one of preferential use, expulsion being more an international term while deportation is more used in municipal law. [...] One study [discusses this distinction] but immediately adds that in modern practice both terms have become interchangeable." See {{cite book|author=Jean-Marie Henckaerts|title=Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3kaTLyAKo0C&amp;pg=PA5|date=6 July 1995|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Pblishers|isbn=90-411-0072-5|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

Definitions of deportation apply equally to nationals and foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;Henckaerts, ''Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice'', 1995, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in the common usage the expulsion of foreign nationals is usually called deportation, whereas the expulsion of nationals is called [[extradition]], banishment, [[exile]], or [[penal transportation]]. For example, in the [[United States]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Strictly speaking, transportation, extradition, and deportation, although each has the effect of removing a person from the country, are different things, and have different purposes. Transportation is by way of punishment of one convicted of an offense against the laws of the country. Extradition is the surrender to another country of one accused of an offense against its laws, there to be tried, and, if found guilty, punished. Deportation is the removal of an alien out of the country, simply because his presence is deemed inconsistent with the public welfare and without any punishment being imposed or contemplated either under the laws of the country out of which he is sent or of those of the country to which he is taken."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Fong Yue Ting v.

Expulsion is an act by a public authority to remove a person or persons against his or her will from the territory of that state. A successful expulsion of a person by a country is called a deportation.{{sfn|IOM|2011|p=27}}

According to the European Court of Human Rights, collective expulsion is any measure compelling non-nationals, as a group, to leave a country, except where such a measure is taken on the basis of a reasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each individual non-national of the group. Mass expulsion may also occur when members of an ethnic group are sent out of a state regardless of nationality. Collective expulsion, or expulsion en masse, is prohibited by several instruments of international law.{{sfn|IOM|2011|p=35}}

==History==

Deportations widely occurred in ancient history.

===In Achaemenid Empire===
Deportation was practiced as a policy toward rebellious people in [[Achaemenid Empire]]. The precise legal status of the deportees is unclear; but ill-treatment is not recorded. Instances include:&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/deportations|title=DEPORTATIONS – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Parthian Empire===

Unlike in the Achaemenid and Sassanian periods, records of deportation are rare during the [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid Parthian]] period. One notable example was the deportaion of the [[Mards]] in [[Charax Spasinu|Charax]], near [[Rey, Iran|Rhages]] (Ray) by [[Phraates I]]. The 10,000 Roman prisonors of war after the [[Battle of Carrhae]] appear to have been deported to [[Alexandria Margiana]] (Merv) near the eastern border in 53 BC, who are said to married to local people. It is hypothesized that some of them founded the Chinese city of [[Li-Jien]] after becoming soldiers for the [[Hsiung-nu]], but this is doubted.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

[[Hyrcanus II]], the Jewish king of Judea, was settled among the Jews of [[Babylon]] in [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]] after being taken as captive by the [[Pompeian–Parthian invasion of 40 BC|Parthian-Jewish forces in 40 BC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kooten |first1=George H. van |last2=Barthel |first2=Peter |title=The Star of Bethlehem and the Magi: Interdisciplinary Perspectives from Experts on the Ancient Near East, the Greco-Roman World, and Modern Astronomy |date=2015 |publisher=BRILL |location=540 |isbn=9789004308473 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnbsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA540 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman POWs in the [[Antony's Parthian War]] may have suffered deportation.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

===In Sassanid Empire===

Deportation was widely used by the Sasanians, especially during the [[Roman-Persian wars|wars with the Romans]].

During [[Shapur I]]'s reign, the Romans (including [[Publius Licinius Valerianus|Valerian]]) who were defeated at the [[Battle of Edessa]] were deported to [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Persis]]. Other destinations were [[Parthia]], [[History of Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], and [[Asorestan]]. There were cities which were founded and were populated by Romans prisoners of war, including Shadh-Shapur ([[Dayr Mikhraq]]) in [[Meshan]], [[Bishapur]] in Persis, Wuzurg-Shapur ([['Uqbara]]; Marw-Ḥābūr), and [[Gundeshapur]]. Agricultural land were also given to the deportees. These deportations initiated the spread [[Christianity in Iran|Christianity in the Sassanian empire]]. In Rēw-Ardashīr ([[Rishahr]]; Yarānshahr), Persis, there was a church for the Romans and another one for [[Carmanians]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; In the mid-3rd century, Greek-speaking deportees from north-western Syria were settled in [[Kashkar]], Mesopotamia.

After the Arab incursion into Persia during [[Shapur II]]'s reign, he scattered the [[Shapur II's Arab campaign|defeated Arab tribes]] by deporting them to other regions. Some where deported to [[Bahrain]] and [[Carmania (satrapy)|Kirman]], possibly to both populate these unattractive regions (due to their climate) and bringing the tribes under control.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

In 395 AD, 18,000 Roman populations of [[Sophene]], [[Armenia]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Roman Syria|Syria]], and [[Cappadocia]] were captured and deported by the "[[Huns]]". the prisoners were freed by the Persians as they reached Persia, and were settled in Slōk ([[Veh-Ardashir|Wēh Ardashīr]]) and Kōkbā (Kōkhē). The author of the text ''Liber Calipharum'' has praised the king [[Yazdegerd I]] (399–420) for his treatment of the deportees, who also allowed some to return.&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

Major deportations occurred during the [[Anastasian War]].&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt;

Major deportations occurred during the campaigns of [[Khosrau I]] from the Roman cities of [[Sura]], [[Aleppo|Beroea]], [[Antioch]], [[Apamea (Euphrates)|Apamea]], [[Raqqa|Callinicum]], and [[Batnai]] in [[Osrhoene]], to [[Wēh-Antiyōk-Khosrow]] (also known as Rūmagān; in Arabic: al-Rūmiyya). The city was founded near [[Ctesiphon]] especially for them, and Khosrow reportedly "did everything in his power to make the residents want to stay".&lt;ref name=iranica /&gt; The number of the deportees is recorded to be 292,000 in another source.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, ''The Decline of Iranshahr: Irrigation and Environments in the History of the Middle East, 500 B.C. to A.D. 1500'', 1993. {{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military occupation==

All countries reserve the right to deport persons without [[right of abode]] even those who are longtime [[Residency (domicile)|residents]] or possess [[permanent residency]]. In general, foreigners who have committed serious crimes, entered the country illegally, overstayed or broken the conditions of their [[Visa (document)|visa]], or otherwise lost their legal status to remain in the country may be administratively removed or deported.&lt;ref&gt;Henckaerts, ''Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice'', 1995, p. 5; Forsythe and Lawson, ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights'', 1996, pp. 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, even citizens can be deported; Saudi Arabia and the UAE for example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21710679-many-are-left-stateless-result-silence-dissidents-gulf-states-are|title=To silence dissidents, Gulf states are revoking their citizenship|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some western countries also have the ability to deport citizens, if they have another nationality or if they acquire citizenship through fraud.

In many cases, deportation is done by the [[government]]'s [[executive (government)|executive]] apparatus, and as such is often subject to a simpler legal process (or none), with reduced or no right to trial, legal representation or [[appeal]] due to the subject's lack of citizenship. For example, in the 1930s, during the Great Depression, more stringent enforcement of immigration laws were ordered by the executive branch of the U.S. government, which led to [[Mexican Repatriation|the expulsion]] of up to 2 million Mexican nationals from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, "The Federal Deportation Campaign in Texas: Mexican Deportation from the Lower Rio Grande Valley During the Great Depression", ''Borderlands Journal'', Fall 1981; Balderrama and Rodriguez, ''Decade of Betrayal: Mexican Repatriation in the 1930s'', 1995; Valenciana, "Unconstitutional Deportation of Mexican Americans During the 1930s: A Family History and Oral History", ''Multicultural Education'', Spring 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, the executive branch of the U.S. government implemented [[Operation Wetback]], a program created in response to public hysteria about immigration and immigrants from Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;See Albert G.

The ICE website publishes removal statistics annually on its website. According to recent numbers ICE removed a total of 240,255 aliens in FY 2016, a two percent increase over FY 2015, but a 24 percent decrease from FY 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ice.gov/removal-statistics/2016|title=FY 2016 ICE Immigration Removals|website=www.ice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in [[natural law]] of the 18th century, philosophers agreed that expulsion of a nation from the territory that it historically inhabits is not allowable.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Emerich de Vattel]], ''The Law of Nations - Principles of the Law of Nature, Applied to the Conduct and Affairs of Nations and Sovereigns'' (translated from French), Philadelphia 1856 (Dublin 1792), Book II, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pBwMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA168 § 90.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 20th century, the [[United Nations]] drafted a code related to [[crimes against humanity]]; Article 18 of the ''Draft Code of Crimes Against the Peace and Security of Mankind'' declares "large scale" arbitrary or forcible deportation to be a [[crime against humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;International Law Commission, ''Yearbook of the International Law Commission 1996: Report of the Commission to the General Assembly on the Work of Its 48th Session'', 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deportation often requires a specific process that must be validated by a court or senior government official. It should not be confused with [[administrative removal]], which is the process of a country denying entry to individuals at a port of entry and expelling them.&lt;ref&gt;Fragomen and Bell, ''Immigration Fundamentals: A Guide to Law and Practice''. New York: Practising Law Institute, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/deportations-removals-and-voluntary-departures-from-the-uk/|title=Deportations, Removals and Voluntary Departures from the UK - Migration Observatory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal deportation==
[[Image:Bisbee deportation lowell.jpg|thumb|Striking miners and others being deported at gunpoint from [[Lowell, Arizona]], on July 12, 1917, during the [[Bisbee Deportation]].]]

Deportation can also happen within a state, when (for example) an individual or a group of people is forcibly resettled to a different part of the country. If ethnic groups are affected by this, it may also be referred to as [[population transfer]]. The rationale is often that these groups might assist the enemy in war or insurrection. For example, the American state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] deported 400 female mill workers during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] on the suspicion they were Northern sympathizers.&lt;ref&gt;Dillman, ''The Roswell Mills and A Civil War Tragedy: Excerpts from Days Gone by in Alpharetta and Roswell, Georgia'', 1996; Hitt, ''Charged with Treason: The Ordeal of 400 Mill Workers During Military Operations in Roswell, Georgia, 1864–1865'', 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], [[Joseph Stalin]] (see [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]]) ordered the deportation of [[Volga German]]s, [[Chechens]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Ukrainians]] and others to areas away from the front, including central and western Soviet Union. Some historians have estimated the number of deaths from the deportation to be as high as 1 in 3 among some populations.&lt;ref&gt;In one estimate, based on a report by [[Lavrenti Beria]] to [[Joseph Stalin]], 150,000 of 478,479 deported Ingush and Chechen people (or 31.3 percent) died within the first four years of the resettlement. See: Kleveman, Lutz. ''The New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia''. Jackson, Tenn.: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-87113-906-5}}. Another scholar puts the number of deaths at 22.7 percent: Extrapolating from [[NKVD]] records, 113,000 Ingush and Chechens died (3,000 before deportation, 10,000 during deportation, and 100,000 after resettlement) in the first three years of the resettlement out of 496,460 total deportees. See: Naimark, Norman M. ''Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00994-0}}. A third source says a quarter of the 650,000 deported Chechens, Ingush, Karachais and Kalmyks died within four years of resettlement. See: Mawdsley, Evan. ''The Stalin Years: The Soviet Union 1929–1953''. Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7190-6377-9}}. However, estimates of the number of deportees sometimes varies widely. Two scholars estimated the number of Chechen and Ingush deportees at 700,000, which would halve the percentage estimates of deaths. See: Fischer, Ruth and Leggett, John C. ''Stalin and German Communism: A Study in the Origins of the State Party''. Edison, N.J.: Transaction Publishers, 2006. {{ISBN|0-87855-822-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conquest, Robert. ''The Nation Killers''. New York: Macmillan, 1970. {{ISBN|0-333-10575-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 26, 2004 the [[European Parliament]] characterized deportations of the Chechens as an act of [[genocide]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massviolence.org/The-Massive-Deportation-of-the-Chechen-People-How-and-why?artpage=8#outil_sommaire_5 Campana, Aurélie.

The Soviet Union also used deportation, as well as instituting the Russian language as the only working language and other such tactics, to achieve [[Russification]] of its occupied territories (such as the [[Baltic nations]] and [[Bessarabia]]). In this way, it removed the historical ethnic populations and repopulated the areas with Russian nationals. The deported people were sent to remote, scarcely populated areas or to GULAG labour camps. It has been estimated that, in their entirety, internal forced migrations affected some 6 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Pavel Polian]]| title=[[Against Their Will (book)|Against Their Will]]: The History and Geography of Forced Migrations in the USSR| publisher=[[Central European University Press]], 2004 |isbn=978-963-9241-68-8| page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ktrYux1gTMC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=internal+forced+migrations+6+million+people#v=onepage&amp;q=internal%20forced%20migrations%206%20million%20people&amp;f=false 4]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosefielde83"&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Red Holocaust (2009 book)|Red Holocaust]] |last= Rosefielde |first= Steven |authorlink= Steven Rosefielde |coauthors= |year= 2009 |publisher= [[Routledge]] |location= |isbn= 978-0-415-77757-5 |pages=83 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, some 1 to 1.5 million perished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Naimark|Naimark, Norman M.]] ''Stalin's Genocides (Human Rights and Crimes against Humanity)''.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, deportation of union members and [[trade union|labor]] leaders was not uncommon in the United States during [[strike action|strikes]] or labor disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Deportation is the term commonly used to depict ejecting an individual from a political or legal jurisdiction. It has been used by the press, legal community, historians and sociologists. See, variously, "Lewis Attacks Deportation of Leaders by West Virginia Authorities", ''The New York Times'', July 17, 1921; "The Law of Necessity As Applied in the Bisbee Deportation Case", ''Arizona Law Review'', 1961; Martin, ''The Corpse On Boomerang Road: Telluride's War on Labor, 1899–1908'', 2004; Silverberg, "Citizens' Committees: Their Role in Industrial Conflict", ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', March 1941; Suggs, ''Colorado's War on Militant Unionism: James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners'', 1991; Lindquist and Fraser, "A Sociological Interpretation of the Bisbee Deportation", ''Pacific Historical Review'', November 1968. Deportation has also been used to describe these events by Presidential commissions; see President's Mediation Commission, ''Report on the Bisbee Deportations'', 1918. The U.S. Supreme Court has also referred to forced internal removal as deportation; see ''[[United States v. Guest]]'', 383 U.S. 745, (1966), Harlan, concurring in part and dissenting in part, at 766.&lt;/ref&gt; For an example, see the [[Bisbee Deportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Bisbee Deportation 1917 |publisher=University of Arizona |url=http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/bisbee/ |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colonial deportations==
{{see also|Convicts in Australia}}
Deporting individuals to a colony is a special case that is neither completely internal nor external. Such deportation has occurred in history. For example, after 1717, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|Britain]] deported around 40,000&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill |first=David |title=1788 the brutal truth of the first fleet |publisher=Random House Australia |isbn=978-1741668001 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}} religious objectors and criminals to America before the practice ceased in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, ''Coming to America: A History of Immigration and Ethnicity in American Life'', 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The criminals were sold by jailers to shipping contractors, who then sold them to plantation owners. The criminal was forced to work for the plantation owner for the duration of their sentence.&lt;ref name=DH/&gt;{{rp|5}} The loss of America as a colony, Australia became the destination for criminals deported to British colonies. More than 160,000&lt;ref name=DH/&gt;{{rp|1}} criminals were transported to Australia between 1787 and 1855.&lt;ref&gt;McCaffray and Melancon, p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 120,000 [[Serbs]] were deported from the [[Independent State of Croatia]] to [[German-occupied Serbia]], and 300,000 fled by 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|title=The Three Yugoslavias: State-Building and Legitimation, 1918–2005|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTw3lEqi2-oC|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|location=New York|isbn=0-253-34656-8|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noteworthy deportees==
[[Alexander Berkman]], [[Emma Goldman]], [[C.L.R. James]], [[Claudia Jones]], [[Fritz Julius Kuhn]], [[Lucky Luciano]], and [[Anna Sage]] were all deported from the United States by being arrested and brought to the federal immigration control station on [[Ellis Island]] in New York Harbor and, from there, forcibly removed from the United States.

==Popular culture==
In literature, deportation appears as an overriding theme in the 1935 novel, ''Strange Passage'' by Theodore D. Irwin.
Films depicting or dealing with fictional cases of deportation are many and varied. Among them are ''[[Ellis Island (1936 film)|Ellis Island]]'' (1936), ''[[Exile Express]]'' (1939), ''[[Five Came Back]]'' (1939), ''[[Deported (film)|Deported]]'' (1950), and ''[[Gambling House (film)|Gambling House]]'' (1951). More recently, [[wikipedia:Shottas|''Shottas'']] (2002) treated the issue of U.S. deportation to the Caribbean post-1997.

The term '''dialect''' (from Latin {{wikt-lang|la|dialectus}}, {{wikt-lang|la|dialectos}}, from the [[Ancient Greek]] word {{wikt-lang|grc|διάλεκτος}}, {{grc-tr|διάλεκτος}}, "discourse", from {{wikt-lang|grc|διά}}, {{grc-tr|διά}}, "through" and {{wikt-lang|grc|λέγω}}, {{grc-tr|λέγω}}, "I speak") is used in two distinct ways to refer to two different types of [[linguistic]] phenomena:

* One usage refers to a [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of a [[language]] that is a characteristic of a particular group of the language's speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50063104?query_type=word&amp;queryword=dialect&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=tFGd-Bh8USU-18775&amp;hilite=50063104 Oxford English dictionary.] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this definition, the dialects or varieties of a particular language are closely related and, despite their differences, are most often largely [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]], especially if close to one another on the [[dialect continuum]]. The term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other factors, such as [[social class]] or [[ethnicity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/dialect Merriam-Webster Online dictionary.]&lt;/ref&gt; A dialect that is associated with a particular [[social class]] can be termed a [[sociolect]], a dialect that is associated with a particular [[ethnic group]] can be termed as [[ethnolect]], and a regional dialect may be termed a regiolect.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt and Schilling, Natalie. 2016. ''American English: Dialects and Variation.'' West Sussex: John Wiley &amp; Sons, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this definition, any variety of a given language constitutes "a dialect", including any [[standard language|standard varieties]]. In this case, the distinction between the "standard language" (i.e. the "standard" dialect of a particular language) and the "nonstandard" dialects of the same language is often [[arbitrary]] and based on social, political, cultural, or historical considerations.&lt;ref name="chao"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chao|first1=Yuen Ren|title=Language and Symbolic Systems|date=1968|publisher=CUP archive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Se87AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=language+standard+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyutrzrYDOAhWGPj4KHaAZD_IQ6AEIOzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20standard%20dialect&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lyons"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lyons|first1=John|title=Language and Linguistics|date=1981|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Wg57a3DdYYC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=language+standard+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyutrzrYDOAhWGPj4KHaAZD_IQ6AEIQTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20standard%20dialect&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=David|title=How Myths about Language Affect Education: What Every Teacher Should Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPsVxfVDXp0C&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=language+standard+dialect&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyutrzrYDOAhWGPj4KHaAZD_IQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&amp;q=language%20standard%20dialect&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, the definitions of the terms "language" and "dialect" may overlap and are often subject to debate, with the differentiation between the two classifications often grounded in arbitrary and/or sociopolitical motives.&lt;ref name="mcworther"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McWorther|first1=John|title=What's a Language, Anyway?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/01/difference-between-language-dialect/424704/|accessdate=19 July 2016|agency=The Atlantic|date=Jan 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The other usage of the term "dialect", often deployed in [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] settings, refers (often somewhat pejoratively) to a language that is [[Social stratification|socially subordinated]] to a regional or national [[standard language]], often historically [[cognate]] or [[Genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetically related]] to the standard language, but not actually derived ''from'' the standard language. In other words, it is not an actual [[variety (linguistics)|variety]] of the "standard language" or dominant language, but rather a separate, independently evolved but often distantly related language.&lt;ref name=maiden&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maiden|first1=Martin|last2=Parry|first2=Mair|title=The Dialects of Italy|year=1997|publisher=Routledge|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9Dz_LyQF_eAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dialects+of+italy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAWoVChMI47KwhKr1yAIVjD8-Ch3bQQsQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, unlike in the first usage, the standard language would not itself be considered a "dialect", as it is the dominant language in a particular state or region, whether in terms of [[Prestige (linguistics)|linguistic prestige]], social or political status, [[official language|official status]], predominance or prevalence, or all of the above. Meanwhile, under this usage, the "dialects" subordinate to the standard language are generally not variations on the standard language but rather separate (but often loosely related) languages in and of themselves. Thus, these "dialects" are not dialects or varieties of a particular language in the same sense as in the first usage; though they may share roots in the same [[Language family|family]] or subfamily as the standard language and may even, to varying degrees, share some [[mutual intelligibility]] with the standard language, they often did not evolve closely with the standard language or within the same linguistic subgroup or [[speech community]] as the standard language and instead may better fit the criteria of a separate language.

For example, most of the various regional [[Romance language|Romance]] [[languages of Italy]], often colloquially referred to as Italian "dialects", are, in fact, not ''actually'' derived from modern [[standard Italian]], but rather evolved from [[Vulgar Latin]] separately and individually from one another and independently of standard Italian, long prior to the diffusion of a national standardized language throughout what is now [[Italy]]. These various Latin-derived regional languages are, therefore, in a linguistic sense, not truly "dialects" or varieties of the [[standard Italian|standard Italian language]], but are instead better defined as their own separate languages. Conversely, with the spread of standard Italian throughout Italy in the 20th century, regional versions or varieties of standard Italian have developed, generally as a mix of national standard Italian with a [[substratum]] of local regional languages and local accents. While [[dialect levelling|"dialect" levelling]] has increased the number of standard Italian speakers and decreased the number of speakers of other languages native to Italy, Italians in different regions have developed variations of standard Italian particular to their region. These variations on standard Italian, known as [[regional Italian]], would thus more appropriately be called "dialects" in accordance with the first linguistic definition of "dialect", as they are in fact derived partially or mostly from standard Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Loporcaro | first= Michele | year= 2009 | title= Profilo linguistico dei dialetti italiani | location= Bari | publisher= Laterza | ref= harv | language=Italian }}; {{cite book | last= Marcato | first= Carla | year= 2007 | title= Dialetto, dialetti e italiano | location= Bologna | publisher= Il Mulino | ref= harv | language=Italian}}; {{cite book| last= Posner | first= Rebecca | year= 1996 | title= The Romance languages | location= Cambridge | publisher= Cambridge University Press | ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maiden/&gt;&lt;ref name=repetti&gt;{{cite book|last1=Repetti|first1=Lori|title=Phonological Theory and the Dialects of Italy|date=2000|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z1f5fIrtw58C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dialects+of+italy&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAGoVChMI47KwhKr1yAIVjD8-Ch3bQQsQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dialects%20of%20italy&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A dialect is distinguished by its vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation ([[phonology]], including [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]]). Where a distinction can be made only in terms of pronunciation (including prosody, or just prosody itself), the term ''[[Accent (dialect)|accent]]'' may be preferred over ''dialect''. Other types of speech varieties include [[jargon]]s, which are characterized by differences in [[lexicon]] ([[vocabulary]]); [[slang]]; [[patois]]; [[pidgin]]s; and [[argot]]s. The particular speech patterns used by an individual are termed an [[idiolect]].

==Standard and non-standard dialect==
A ''standard dialect'' (also known as a '''standardized dialect''' or "[[standard language]]") is a dialect that is supported by institutions. Such institutional support may include government recognition or designation; presentation as being the "correct" form of a language in schools; published grammars, dictionaries, and textbooks that set forth a correct spoken and written form; and an extensive formal literature that employs that dialect (prose, poetry, non-fiction, etc.). There may be multiple standard dialects associated with a single language. For example, Standard [[American English]], Standard [[British English]], Standard [[Canadian English]], Standard [[Indian English]], Standard [[Australian English]], and Standard [[Philippine English]] may all be said to be standard dialects of the [[English language]].

A [[nonstandard dialect]], like a standard dialect, has a complete vocabulary, grammar, and [[Syntax|syntax]], but is usually not the beneficiary of institutional support. Examples of a nonstandard English dialect are [[Southern American English]], [[Western Australian English]], [[New York English]], [[New England English]], [[Mid-Atlantic American English| Mid-Atlantic American]] or [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]] / [[Baltimorese|Baltimore]] English, [[Scouse]], [[Brummie]], [[Cockney accent|Cockney]], and [[Yorkshire dialect|Tyke]]. The [[Dialect Test]] was designed by [[Joseph Wright (linguist)|Joseph Wright]] to compare different English dialects with each other.

== Dialect or language ==
{{see also|Abstand and ausbau languages|A language is a dialect with an army and navy}}
There is no universally accepted criterion for distinguishing two different languages from two dialects (i.e. varieties) of the same language.&lt;ref&gt;Cysouw, Michael; Good, Jeff. (2013). "Languoid, Doculect, and Glossonym: Formalizing the Notion 'Language'." ''Language Documentation and Conservation''. 7. 331–359. {{hdl|10125/4606}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of rough measures exist, sometimes leading to contradictory results. The distinction is therefore subjective and depends upon the user's frame of reference. For example, there has been discussion about whether or not the [[Limón Creole English]] should be considered "a kind" of English or a different language. This creole is spoken in the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica (Central America) by descendants of Jamaican people. The position that Costa Rican linguists support depends upon which University they represent.

The most common, and most purely linguistic, criterion is that of [[mutual intelligibility]]: two varieties are said to be dialects of the same language if being a speaker of one variety confers sufficient knowledge to understand and be understood by a speaker of the other; otherwise, they are said to be different languages. However, this definition becomes problematic in the case of [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]], in which it may be the case that dialect B is mutually intelligible with both dialect A and dialect C but dialects A and C are not mutually intelligible with each other. In this case, the criterion of mutual intelligibility makes it impossible to decide whether A and C are dialects of the same language or not. The mutual intelligibility criterion also flounders in cases in which a speaker of dialect X can understand a speaker of dialect Y, but not vice versa.

=== Sociolinguistic definitions ===
[[File:West Germanic dialect diagram.svg|thumb|right|upright=2|Local varieties in the West Germanic dialect continuum are oriented towards either Standard Dutch or Standard German depending on which side of the border they are spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another occasionally used criterion for discriminating dialects from languages is the [[sociolinguistic]] notion of [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|linguistic authority]]. According to this definition, two varieties are considered dialects of the same language if (under at least some circumstances) they would defer to the same authority regarding some questions about their language. For instance, to learn the name of a new invention, or an obscure foreign species of plant, speakers of [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]] and [[East Franconian German]] might each consult a German dictionary or ask a German-speaking expert in the subject.
Thus these varieties are said to be dependent on, or [[autonomy and heteronomy (sociolinguistics)|heteronomous]] with respect to, [[Standard German]], which is said to be autonomous.
In contrast, speakers in the Netherlands of [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxon]] varieties similar to Westphalian would instead consult a dictionary of [[Standard Dutch]].
Similarly, although Yiddish is classified by linguists as a language in the [[Middle High German]] group of languages, a Yiddish speaker would consult a different dictionary in such a case.

Within this framework, [[William Alexander Stewart|W. A. Stewart]] defined a ''language'' as an autonomous variety together with all the varieties that are heteronomous with respect to it, noting that an essentially equivalent definition had been stated by [[Charles A. Ferguson]] and [[John J. Gumperz]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite book

}} p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, a heteronomous variety may be considered a ''dialect'' of a language defined in this way.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;
In these terms, [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], though mutually intelligible to a large degree, are considered separate languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chambers|Trudgill|1998|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dialect and language clusters ===

In other situations, a closely related group of varieties possess considerable (though incomplete) mutual intelligibility, but none dominates the others.
To describe this situation, the editors of the ''Handbook of African Languages'' introduced the term ''dialect cluster''.
Dialect clusters were treated as classificatory units at the same level as languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | journal = Africa | volume = 16 | number = 3 | year = 1946 | pages = 156–159
  | jstor = 1156320
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar situation, but with a greater degree of mutual unintelligibility, has been termed a ''language cluster''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Political factors ===

In many societies, however, a particular dialect, often the sociolect of the [[elite]] class, comes to be identified as the "standard" or "proper" version of a language by those seeking to make a social distinction and is contrasted with other varieties. As a result of this, in some contexts, the term "dialect" refers specifically to varieties with low [[social status]]. In this secondary sense of "dialect", language varieties are often called ''dialects'' rather than ''languages'':
* if they have no standard or [[Codification (linguistics)|codified]] form,
* if they are rarely or never used in writing (outside reported speech),
* if the speakers of the given language do not have a [[State (polity)|state]] of their own,
* if they lack [[prestige dialect|prestige]] with respect to some other, often standardised, variety.

The status of "language" is not solely determined by linguistic criteria, but it is also the result of a historical and political development. [[Romansh language|Romansh]] came to be a written language, and therefore it is recognized as a language, even though it is very close to the Lombardic alpine dialects. An opposite example is the case of [[Chinese language|Chinese]], whose variations such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Yue Chinese|Cantonese]] are often called dialects and not languages in China, despite their mutual unintelligibility.

Modern [[nationalism]], as developed especially since the [[French Revolution]], has made the distinction between "language" and "dialect" an issue of great political importance. A group speaking a separate "language" is often seen as having a greater claim to being a separate "people", and thus to be more deserving of its own independent state, while a group speaking a "dialect" tends to be seen not as "a people" in its own right, but as a sub-group, part of a bigger people, which must content itself with regional autonomy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The distinction between language and dialect is thus inevitably made at least as much on a political basis as on a linguistic one, and can lead to great political controversy or even armed conflict.

The [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] linguist [[Max Weinreich]] published the expression, ''A shprakh iz a dialekt mit an armey un flot'' ({{rtl-lang|yi|"אַ שפּראַך איז אַ דיאַלעקט מיט אַן אַרמײ און פֿלאָט"}}: "[[A language is a dialect with an army and navy]]") in ''YIVO Bleter'' 25.1, 1945, p.&amp;nbsp;13. The significance of the political factors in any attempt at answering the question "what is a language?" is great enough to cast doubt on whether any strictly linguistic definition, without a socio-cultural approach, is possible. This is illustrated by the frequency with which the army-navy aphorism is cited.

==={{anchor|languoid}}Terminology ===

By the definition most commonly used by linguists, any linguistic variety can be considered a "dialect" of ''some'' language—"everybody speaks a dialect". According to that interpretation, the criteria above merely serve to distinguish whether two varieties are dialects of the ''same'' language or dialects of ''different'' languages.

The terms "language" and "dialect" are not necessarily mutually exclusive, although it is often perceived to be.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Thus there is nothing contradictory in the statement "the ''language'' of the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] is a dialect of [[German (language)|German]]".

There are various terms that linguists may use to avoid taking a position on whether the speech of a community is an independent language in its own right or a dialect of another language. Perhaps the most common is "[[variety (linguistics)|variety]]";&lt;ref name=finegan&gt;{{cite book |title=Language: Its Structure and Use|edition=5th |last=Finegan |first=Edward |year=2007 |publisher= Thomson Wadsworth|location=Boston, MA, USA|isbn=978-1-4130-3055-6 |page=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[lect]]" is another.  A more general term is "languoid", which does not distinguish between dialects, languages, and groups of languages, whether genealogically related or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glottopedia.org/index.php/Languoid "Languoid"] at ''Glottopedia.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

{{see also|Mesoamerican languages#Language vs. dialect|l1=Mesoamerican languages § Language vs. dialect}}

=== German ===
When talking about the German language, the term [[German dialects]] is only used for the traditional regional varieties. That allows them to be distinguished from the regional varieties of modern standard German.

The German dialects show a wide spectrum of variation. Some of them are not mutually intelligible. [[German dialectology]] traditionally names the major dialect groups after [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] from which they were assumed to have descended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cutewriters.com/german-language-dialect-variations/|title=From dialect to variation space|last=Danvas|first=Kegesa|date=2016|website=Cutewriters|publisher=Cutewriters Inc.|access-date=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent to which the dialects are spoken varies according to a number of factors: In Northern Germany, dialects are less common than in the South. In cities, dialects are less common than in the countryside. In a public environment, dialects are less common than in a familiar environment.

The situation in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]] is different from the rest of the German-speaking countries. The [[Swiss German]] dialects are the default everyday language in virtually every situation, whereas standard German is only spoken in education, partially in media, and with foreigners not possessing knowledge of Swiss German. Most Swiss German speakers perceive standard German to be a foreign language.

The [[Low German]] varieties spoken in Germany are often counted among the German dialects. This reflects the modern situation where they are [[Dachsprache|roofed]] by standard German. This is different from the situation in the [[Middle Ages]] when Low German had strong tendencies towards an [[ausbau language]].

The [[Frisian languages]] spoken in Germany are excluded from the German dialects.

===Italian===
{{See also|Languages of Italy|Regional Italian}}
Italy is home to a vast array of [[Languages of Italy|native regional minority languages]], most of which are [[Romance language|Romance]]-based and have their own local variants. These [[regional language]]s are often referred to colloquially or in non-linguistic circles as Italian "dialects", or ''dialetti'' (standard Italian for "dialects"). However, the majority of the regional languages in Italy are in fact not actually "dialects" of [[standard Italian]] in the strict linguistic sense, as they are not derived from modern [[standard Italian]] but instead evolved locally from [[Vulgar Latin]] independent of standard Italian, with little to no influence from what is now known as "standard Italian." They are therefore better classified as individual languages rather than "dialects."

In addition to having evolved, for the most part, separately from one another and with distinct individual histories, the [[Latin]]-based regional Romance languages of Italy are also better classified as separate languages rather than true "dialects" due to the often high degree in which they lack [[mutual intelligibility]]. Though mostly mutually unintelligible, the exact degree to which the regional Italian languages are mutually unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical distance or geographical barriers between the languages, with some regional Italian languages that are closer in geographical proximity to each other or closer to each other on the [[dialect continuum]] being more or less mutually intelligible. For instance, a speaker of purely [[Eastern Lombard dialect|Eastern Lombard]], a language in [[Northern Italy]]'s [[Lombardy|Lombardy region]] that includes the [[Bergamasque dialect]], would have severely limited mutual intelligibility with a purely [[standard Italian]] speaker and would be nearly completely unintelligible to a speaker of a pure [[Sicilian language]] variant. Due to Eastern Lombard's status as a [[Gallo-Italic]] language, an Eastern Lombard speaker may, in fact, have more mutual intelligibility with a [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], or [[French language|French]] speaker than with a standard Italian or Sicilian language speaker. Meanwhile, a Sicilian language speaker would have a greater degree of mutual intelligibility with a speaker of the more closely related [[Neapolitan language]], but far less mutual intelligibility with a person speaking [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily|Sicilian Gallo-Italic]], a language that developed in isolated Lombard emigrant communities on the [[Sicily|same island]] as the Sicilian language.

Modern standard Italian itself is heavily based on the Latin-derived [[Florentine dialect|Florentine]] [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan language]]. The Tuscan-based language that would eventually become modern standard Italian had been used in poetry and literature since at least the [[12th century]], and it first spread throughout Italy among the educated upper class through the works of authors such as [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], and [[Petrarch]]. Dante's Florentine-Tuscan literary Italian thus slowly became the language of the [[literate]] and [[upper class]] in Italy, and it spread throughout the peninsula as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' among the Italian [[educated]] class as well as Italian traveling merchants. The economic prowess and cultural and artistic importance of [[Tuscany]] in the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]] further encouraged the diffusion of the Florentine-Tuscan Italian throughout Italy and among the educated and powerful, though local and regional languages remained the main languages of the common people.

During the [[Risorgimento]], proponents of Italian republicanism and Italian nationalism, such as [[Alessandro Manzoni]], stressed the importance of establishing a uniform [[national language]] in order to better create an Italian [[national identity]]. With the [[unification of Italy]] in the 1860s, standard Italian became the official national language of the new Italian state, while the various unofficial regional languages of Italy gradually became regarded as subordinate "dialects" to Italian, increasingly associated negatively with lack of education or provincialism. However, at the time of the Italian Unification, standard Italian still existed mainly as a literary language, and only 2.5% of Italy's population could speak standard Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=ita |title=Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition |publisher=Ethnologue.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the vast [[conscription]] of Italian men from all throughout Italy during [[World War I]] is credited with facilitating the diffusion of standard Italian among less educated Italian men, as these men from various regions with various regional languages were forced to communicate with each other in a common tongue while serving in the Italian military. With the eventual spread of the radio and television throughout Italy and the establishment of [[public education]], Italians from all regions were increasingly exposed to standard Italian, while literacy rates among all social classes improved. Today, the majority of Italians are able to speak standard Italian, though many Italians still speak their regional language regularly or as their primary day-to-day language, especially at home with family or when communicating with Italians from the same town or region. However, to some Italians, speaking a regional language, especially in a formal setting or outside of one's region, may carry a stigma or negative connotations associated with being lower class, uneducated, boorish, or overly informal.

Italians in different regions today may also speak regional varieties of standard Italian, or [[regional Italian|regional Italian dialects]], which, unlike the majority of [[languages of Italy]], are actually dialects of standard Italian rather than separate languages. A regional Italian dialect is generally standard Italian that has been heavily influenced or mixed with local or regional native languages and accents.

The languages of Italy are primarily [[Latin]]-based [[Romance languages]], with the most widely spoken languages falling within the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian language]] family. This wide category includes:
*Standard Italian and [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]]; 
*the various related [[Central Italian]] dialects, such as [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]] in [[Rome]];
*the [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]] group (also known as "Southern Italian"), which encompasses not only [[Naples]]' and [[Campania]]'s speech but also a variety of related neighboring varieties like the [[Irpinian dialect]], [[Abruzzo|Abruzzese]] and Southern [[Marche]]giano, [[Molisan]], [[Calabrian language#Northern Calabrian (Cosentino)|Northern Calabrian or Cosentino]], and the [[Bari dialect]]. The [[Cilentan dialect]] of [[Salerno]], in [[Campania]], is considered significantly influenced by the Neapolitan and the below-mentioned language groups;
*the [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] group, including [[Salentino dialect|Salentino]] and [[Calabrian languages|Calabrian]].

Aside from the more common [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] [[Romance language]]s in Italy, other native languages in Italy include: 
*a variety of [[Gallo-Italic languages]], [[Gallo-Rhaetian languages]], [[Rhaeto-Romance languages]], and [[Ibero-Romance languages]] (such as [[Emilian-Romagnol language|Emilian-Romagnol]], [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]], [[Friulian]], the [[Lombard language]]s, [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily|Sicilian Gallo-Italic]], [[Algherese dialect|Algherese]], the [[Vivaro-Alpine dialect]], [[Ladin language|Ladin]], etc.); 
*[[Germanic language|Germanic]] languages, such as the [[Cimbrian language]]s, [[Southern Bavarian]], [[Walser German]] and the [[Mòcheno language]];
*the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] [[Arbëresh language]]; 
*the [[Hellenic language|Hellenic]] [[Griko language]] and [[Calabrian Greek]];
*the [[Serbo-Croatian]] [[Slavomolisano dialect]];
*various [[Slovene language]]s, including the [[Gail Valley dialect]] and [[Istrian dialect]].

The [[Sardinian language]] is considered to be its own Romance language family, separate not only from Italian and the wider Italo-Dalmatian family but from all the other Neo-Latin families; it is often subdivided into the [[Campidanese Sardinian|Campidanese]] and [[Logudorese dialect|Logudorese]] dialects. The [[Corsican language|Corsican]]-related [[Gallurese dialect|Gallurese]] and [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]] which are also spoken in [[Sardinia]], on the other hand, are often considered closely related to or derived from [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] and are therefore fully part of the Italo-Dalmatian languages. Furthermore, the [[Gallo-Romance]] language of [[Ligurian (Romance language)|Ligurian]] and the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] [[Algherese dialect]] are also spoken in Sardinia, respectively in [[Carloforte]]/[[Calasetta]] and [[Alghero]].

=== The Balkans ===
The classification of speech varieties as dialects or languages and their relationship to other varieties of speech can be controversial and the verdicts inconsistent. English and [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] illustrate the point. English and Serbo-Croatian each have two major variants ([[British English|British]] and [[American English]], and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]], respectively), along with numerous other varieties. For political reasons, analyzing these varieties as "languages" or "dialects" yields inconsistent results: British and American English, spoken by close political and military allies, are almost universally regarded as varieties of a single language, whereas the national standards of [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]], which are closer to each other than some local vernacular dialects of [[Serbo-Croatian]] are to themselves, differing to a similar extent as the formal varieties of English, are treated by some linguists from the region as distinct languages, largely because the two countries oscillate from being brotherly to being bitter enemies. (The [[Serbo-Croatian|Serbo-Croatian language article]] deals with this topic much more fully.)

Similar examples abound. [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], although largely mutually intelligible with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], certain dialects of Serbo-Croatian and to a lesser extent the rest of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] [[dialect continuum]], is considered by Bulgarian linguists to be a Bulgarian dialect, in contrast with the contemporary international view and the view in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], which regards it as a language in its own right. Nevertheless, before the establishment of a literary standard of Macedonian in 1944, in most sources in and out of Bulgaria before the Second World War, the southern Slavonic dialect continuum covering the area of today's Republic of Macedonia were referred to as Bulgarian dialects.

===Lebanon===
In [[Lebanon]], a part of the Christian population considers "[[Lebanese language|Lebanese]]" to be in some sense a distinct language from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and not merely a dialect. During the civil war Christians often used Lebanese Arabic officially, and sporadically used the [[Latin script]] to write Lebanese, thus further distinguishing it from Arabic. All Lebanese laws are written in the standard literary form of Arabic, though parliamentary debate may be conducted in Lebanese Arabic.

===North Africa===
In Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, the [[Darija]]s (spoken North African languages) are sometimes considered more different from other Arabic dialects. Officially, North African countries prefer to give preference to the [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] and conduct much of their political and religious life in it (adherence to [[Islam]]), and refrain from declaring each country's specific variety to be a separate language, because Literary Arabic is the [[liturgical language]] of Islam and the language of the Islamic sacred book, the [[Qur'an]]. Although, especially since the 1960s, the Darijas are occupying an increasing use and influence in the cultural life of these countries. Examples of cultural elements where Darijas' use became dominant include: theatre, film, music, television, advertisement, social media, folk-tale books and companies' names.

===Ukraine===
The [[Modern Ukrainian language]] has been in common use since the late 17th century, associated with the establishment of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]. In the 19th century, the [[Tsar]]ist Government of the [[Russian Empire]] claimed that [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] was merely a dialect of [[Russian language|Russian]] and not a language on its own. According to these claims, the differences were few and caused by the conquest of western Ukraine by the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, in reality the dialects in Ukraine were developing independently from the dialects in the modern Russia for several centuries, and as a result they differed substantially.

Following the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine–Central Powers)|Brest-Litovsk Treaty]], the [[German Empire]] briefly [[Ukraine during World War I|gained control over Ukraine]] during [[World War I]], but was eventually defeated by the [[Triple Entente|Entente]], with major involvement by the Ukrainian Bolsheviks. After Bolsheviks managed to conquer the rest of Ukraine from the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the [[White movement|Whites]], Ukraine became part of the USSR, whence a process of Ukrainization was begun, with encouragement from Moscow. However, in the late 1920s - early 1930s, the process started to reverse. Witnessing the Ukrainian cultural revival spurred by the ukrainization in the early 1290s, and fearing that it might lead to an independence movement, Moscow started to remove from power and in some cases [[Executed Renaissance|physically eliminate the public proponents]] of ukrainization. The appointment of [[Pavel Postyshev]] as the secretary of the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Communist Party of Ukraine]] marked the end of ukrainization, and the opposite process of russification started. After World War II, citing [[Ukrainian collaboration with Nazi Germany]] in an attempt to gain independence as the reason, Moscow changed its policy towards repression of the Ukrainian language.

Today the boundaries of the Ukrainian language to the Russian language are still not drawn clearly, with an intermediate dialect between them, called [[Surzhyk]], developing in Ukraine.

===Moldova===
There have been cases of a variety of speech being deliberately reclassified to serve political purposes. One example is [[Moldovan language|Moldovan]]. In 1996, the Moldovan parliament, citing fears of "Romanian expansionism", rejected a proposal from [[President of Moldova|President]] [[Mircea Snegur]] to change the name of the language to Romanian, and in 2003 a [[Moldovan–Romanian dictionary]] was published, purporting to show that the two countries speak different languages. Linguists of the [[Romanian Academy]] reacted by declaring that all the Moldovan words were also Romanian words; while in Moldova, the head of the [[Academy of Sciences of Moldova]], Ion Bărbuţă, described the dictionary as a politically motivated "absurdity".

===Greater China===
{{Main|Varieties of Chinese#Classification}}
Unlike languages that use alphabets to indicate their pronunciation, [[Chinese characters]] have developed from [[logograms]] that do not always give hints to their pronunciation. Although the written characters have remained relatively consistent for the last two thousand years, the pronunciation and grammar in different regions have developed to an extent that the [[Varieties of Chinese|varieties of the spoken language]] are often mutually unintelligible. As a series of migration to the south throughout the history, the regional languages of the south, including [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], [[Min Chinese|Min]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] often show traces of [[Old Chinese]] or [[Middle Chinese]]. From the [[Ming dynasty]] onward, Beijing has been the capital of China and the dialect spoken in Beijing has had the most prestige among other varieties. With the founding of the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]], [[Standard Mandarin]] was designated as the official language, based on the spoken language of Beijing. Since then, other spoken varieties are regarded as ''fangyan'' (regional speech). [[Cantonese]] is still the most commonly-used language in [[Guangzhou]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] and among some overseas Chinese communities, whereas [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Hokkien]] has been accepted in [[Taiwan]] as an important local language alongside [[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]].

{{Main|Interlingua}}

One language, [[Interlingua]], was [[Interlingua and eligibility of international words|developed]] so that the languages of Western civilization would act as its dialects.&lt;ref name="coljld"&gt;[[Alice Vanderbilt Morris|Morris, Alice Vanderbilt]], [http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm#manyrepresented General report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060814204450/http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm |date=2006-08-14 }}. New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from such concepts as the [[international scientific vocabulary]] and [[Standard Average European]], linguists{{who|date=July 2013}} developed a theory that the modern Western languages were actually dialects of a hidden or latent language.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} Researchers at the [[International Auxiliary Language Association]] extracted words and affixes that they considered to be part of Interlingua's vocabulary.&lt;ref name = "jawmqc"&gt;[[Alexander Gode|Gode, Alexander]], ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary]]''. New York: Storm Publishers, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, speakers of the Western languages would understand written or spoken Interlingua immediately, without prior study, since their own languages were its dialects.&lt;ref name = "coljld"/&gt; This has often turned out to be true, especially, but not solely, for speakers of the Romance languages and educated speakers of English. Interlingua has also been found to assist in the learning of other languages. In one study, Swedish high school students learning Interlingua were able to translate passages from Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian that students of those languages found too difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;Gopsill, F. P., ''International languages: A matter for Interlingua''. Sheffield: British Interlingua Society, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be noted, however, that the vocabulary of Interlingua extends beyond the Western language families.&lt;ref name = "jawmqc"/&gt;

The '''Doctrine of Cash Equivalence''' states that the [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. Federal income tax law]] treats certain non-cash payment transactions like cash payment transactions for federal income tax purposes.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;{{cite
|first=Samuel A.|last=Donaldson
|title=Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials
|edition=2nd
|date=2007
|page=364
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine is used most often for deciding when cash method (as opposed to [[accrual method]]) taxpayers are to include certain non-cash income items.  Another doctrine often used when trying to determine the timing of the inclusion of income is the [[constructive receipt]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 353&lt;/ref&gt;

Most individuals begin as [[cash method]] taxpayers because their first form of bookkeeping is a checkbook.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, some businesses start as accrual method taxpayers because businesses use different rules for recording income and expenditures.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) § 446(a) states, however, that  "[t]axable income shall be computed under the method of accounting on the basis which the taxpayer regularly computes his income in keeping his books."&lt;ref&gt;{{USC|26|446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major advantages to the cash method of accounting is the ability to defer taxation because the recognition of income applicable to amounts in accounts receivable can be deferred to a later year.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Doctrine of Cash Equivalence''' is important because many people are cash method taxpayers and would be subject to this rule.

==Elements==
Cash method taxpayers include income items (cash and cash equivalents) in the year the items are received.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; See also Treasury Regulations &lt;ref&gt;§ 1.446-1(c)(i)&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain payment transactions involve cash equivalents, such as receipts of checks and credit card payments. The cash equivalence doctrine arose out of a need to determine whether certain items that were either actually or constructively received must be accrued as income. A dispute over timing of income recognition for tax purposes may arise when the thing received is really not much more than a promise of payment, such as a promissory note or a bond. If mere promises to pay were considered cash equivalents, then there would be little difference between the cash and accrual methods for tax purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] established the standard for applying the cash equivalence doctrine to promises of payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Cowden v. Commissioner |vol=289 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=20 |pinpoint= |court=5th Cir. |date=1961 |url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/253663/frank-cowden-sr-and-wife-gladys-cowden-petitioner-respondent-v/ |accessdate=2017-10-18 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court first noted that the principle that "[a] [[promissory note]], negotiable in form, is not necessarily the equivalent of cash" remains true.&lt;ref name="cc24"&gt;''Cowden v Commissioner'', 289 F.2d at 24.&lt;/ref&gt; But that principle also has a true inverse—that a non-[[negotiable instrument]] can be a cash equivalent if the following factors are met.&lt;ref name="cc24"/&gt; A promise to pay will be considered a cash equivalent for cash method taxpayers if:

# the promise to pay is unconditional;
# the promise is made by a solvent person;
# the promise is assignable;

Since taxpayers generally prefer to defer recognition of income to subsequent tax years (due to the [[time value of money]]), a finding of cash equivalence will typically be to the disadvantage of the individual taxpayer.

==Mechanics==
To use the doctrine of cash equivalence, a taxpayer must have either actually received an item, or constructively received an item. If either of these situations exist, a taxpayer must determine whether the item received is cash equivalence, using the six factors described in Cowden v. Commissioner. If the item is deemed cash equivalent, then the taxpayer has income. If it is not cash equivalent, the taxpayer does not have income.

[[Embodied cognition]] occurs when an organism’s sensorimotor capacities (ability of the body to respond to its senses with movement), body and environment play an important role in thinking. The way in which a person’s body and their surroundings interacts also allows for specific brain functions to develop and in the future to be able to act.&lt;ref name=Cowart&gt;Cowart, M. (2005, Jul. 8 ). Embodied Cognition. http://www.iep.utm.edu/embodcog/&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that not only does the mind influence the body’s movements, but the body also influences the abilities of the mind, also termed the [[Bi-directional hypothesis of language and action|bi-directional hypothesis]].   
There are three generalizations that are assumed to be true relating to embodied cognition.  A person's [[motor system]] (that controls movement of the body) is activated when (1) they observe manipulable objects, (2) process action verbs, and (3) observe another individual's movements.&lt;ref&gt;Mahon, B. Z, and A. Caramazza. (2008). A critical look at the embodied cognition hypothesis and a new proposal. Journal of Physiology - Paris, 102 pp. 59–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Embodied [[semantics]] is one of two theories concerning the location and processing of sensory motors inputs within the human brain. The theory of embodied semantics involves the existence of specialized hubs where the meaning of a word is tied with the sensory motor processing unit associated with the word meaning. For example, the concept of kicking would be represented in the sensory motor areas that control kicking actions.&lt;ref name = Rueschemeyer&gt;Rueschemeyer, S. et al. (2010). Effects of Intentional Motor Actions on Embodied Language Processing. Experimental Psychology, 57 (4), pp. 260−66. doi:10.1027/1618-3169/a000031&lt;/ref&gt;   As a result, the theory assumes that individuals must possess a body to understand English.

== Neural Circuitry ==
The overlap between various semantic categories with sensory motor areas suggests that a common mechanism is used by neurons to process action, perception, and semantics. The correlation principle states that neurons that fire together, wire together. Also, neurons out of sync, delink. When an individual pronounces a word, the activation pattern for articulatory motor systems of the speaker leads to activation of auditory and [[Somatosensory system|somatosensory]] systems due to self-perceived sounds and movements. If a word meaning is grounded in the visual shapes of the objects, the word form circuit is active together with neural activity in the ventral-temporal visual stream related to processing of visual object information. Correlation learning links the word and object circuits, resulting in an embodied object-semantic relationship.

==Semantic Hubs==
A semantic hub represents a focal point in the brain where all semantic information pertaining to a specific word is integrated. For example, the color, shape, size, smell, and sound associated with the word “cat” would be integrated at the same semantic hub. Some candidate regions for semantic hubs include:
# Inferior Frontal Cortex: the anterior part of Broca’s area and adjacent tissue in the left Inferior Frontal Cortex including Brodmann’s areas 44, 45, and 47 are activated for semantic processing and functional changes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Superior Temporal Cortex: contains Wernicke’s area which controls the classic posterior language area in and adjacent to the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus. This area is thought to be a semantic processor on the basis of lesion, perfusion, and imaging data.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Inferior Parietal Cortex: angular and adjacent to supramarginal gyrus in inferior parietal cortex is thought to be most strongly activated during semantic processing of cross-modal spatial and temporal configurations.
# Inferior and middle temporal cortex: a general semantic binding site between words and their meaning in left or bilateral medial/inferior temporal cortex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Anterior temporal cortex: thought to be involved in semantic dementia. which is a severe and specific semantic deficit characterized by lesions to both temporal poles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Semantic integration mechanisms involve various hub sites listed above, which contradicts the idea that there is one center where all integration occurs. However, each individual hub is compliant with the amodal model. Collectively, all of the hubs provide evidence for the theory that there are areas within the brain where emotional, sensory, and motor information all converge in one area.

==Semantic Category Specificity==
Each potential semantic hub is activated to a specific degree according to the category that the perceived word belongs to. For example, lesions to each of the five potential hubs do not affect all words. Instead, experimental data determines that one semantic category suffers more than another as it pertains to the word.
# Left Inferior Frontal Cortex and bilateral frontocentral motor systems: these two areas are strongly activated in response to action related words or phrases. Lesions to these two areas produces impairments in the processing of action related words and action related concepts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Bilateral superior temporal Cortex: this area is strongly activated in response to words related to sounds. Lesions to this area produce impairment in sound word processing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Left Inferior Parietal Cortex: especially near the supramarginal gyrus, this area is activated by spatial language. Lesions to the Inferior Parietal Cortex produced impairment involving spatial language such as prepositions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Medial/Inferior Temporal Cortex: this area is strongly activated by category-specific words animals, tools, person’s names, color, and form. Lesions show impairment in category-specific words for these categories as well.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Anterior Temporal Cortex: this area is associated with processing the differences between semantic categories.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Some of the category differences are thought to be produced by the adjacent hubs. For example, category specificity is greatest close to the piriform and anterior insular olfactory cortex. Here, odor words such as “cinnamon” lead to greater activation than control words. In the gustatory cortex in the anterior insula and frontal operculum, taste words such as “sugar” lead to a stronger activation.

==Experiential Trace Hypothesis==
Experiential Trace Hypothesis states that each time an individual interacts with the world, traces of that particular experience are left in our brain.&lt;ref name = ZwannPecher&gt;Zwaan R.A. &amp; Pecher, D. The grounding of cognition: The role of perception and action in memory, language, and thinking. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  These traces can be accessed again when a person thinks of words or sentences that remind them of that experience.  Additionally, these traces in our brain are linked to the action that they are related to.&lt;ref name = ZwannPecher /&gt;   Words and sentences become those cues that retrieve these traces from our mind.  Researchers have studied if the previous experience with a word, such as its location (up or down) in space, affects how people understand and then respond to that word.&lt;ref name = Lachmair&gt;Lachmair, M. et al. (2011). Root versus roof: automatic activation of location information during word processing. Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 18 pp. 1180–88. doi:10.3758/s13423-001-0158-x&lt;/ref&gt;  In one experiment, researchers hypothesized that if reading an object word also activates a location that is linked to that noun, then the following action response should be compatible with that association.&lt;ref name = Lachmair /&gt;  They found that participants were faster to push a button higher than another button when the word was associated with being "up" or "above" than when the button was lower than the other for words associated with "up" and "above".  The results of this study displayed that participants were faster to respond when the location of the word and the action they had to perform were similar.  This demonstrates that language processing and action are connected.  This research also found that the location information of a word is automatically activated after seeing the word.&lt;ref name = Lachmair /&gt;  In a similar study, it was discovered that participants were equally as fast at responding to words that were associated with either an upward or downward location when the buttons to respond to these words were horizontal – meaning that the experiential trace effect was ruled out when the responding action did not link to either of the locations that were activated.&lt;ref name="Zwann"&gt;Zwann, R. A. (2002). Language Comprehenders Mentally Represent the Shape of Objects. Psychological Science, 13 (2), pp. 168–71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experiential-Simulation Theory of Language Understanding===
Some theorists have proposed an experiential-simulation approach of language understanding. They argue that previous experiential traces related to a word may be reactivated at a later stage when accessing the meaning of the same word. This has been highlighted through the example of encountering the word ‘airplane’ in a situation where someone points to an airplane in the sky, thus making one look upwards. These experiential traces, e.g. ‘looking upwards’ are later reactivated when accessing the meaning of the word ‘airplane'. Similarly, another example might be when a person accesses the meaning of the word ‘snail’, they might also access experiential traces associated with this word, e.g. ‘looking downwards’ (likely towards the ground).&lt;ref&gt;Zwaan, R. A., &amp; Madden, C. J. (2005). Embodied sentence comprehension. Grounding cognition: The role of perception and action in memory, language, and thinking, 224-245.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language Comprehension and Motor Systems Involved in Action==

===Concrete verbs===
As a result of previous experience to certain words, several studies have found that the action associated with a certain word is also activated in the motor cortices when processing that same word. For example, using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), it was discovered that exposure to concrete action verbs referring to face, arm, or leg actions (e.g., to lick, pick, kick) activated motor regions that are stimulated when making actions with the foot, hand, or mouth.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Hauk, O., Johnsrude, I., &amp; Pulvermüller, F. (2004). Somatotopic representation of action words in human motor and premotor cortex. Neuron, 41(2), 301-307.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abstract verbs===
However, findings are not as clear cut when abstract verbs are involved. Embodied theories of language comprehension assume that abstract concepts, as well as concrete ones, are grounded in the sensorimotor system (Jirak et al., 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Jirak, D., Menz, M. M., Buccino, G., Borghi, A. M., &amp; Binkofski, F. (2010). Grasping language–A short story on embodiment. Consciousness and Cognition, 19(3), 711-720.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have investigated the activation of motor cortices using abstract and also concrete verbs, examining the stimulation of the motor cortices when comprehending literal action verbs (concrete) vs. the metaphorical usage of the same action verbs (abstract). One such study used fMRI to study participants whilst they viewed actions performed by the mouth, hand or foot, and read literal and metaphorical sentences related to the mouth hand or foot. This study found activation in the premotor cortex for literal action (e.g. “grasping the scissors”) but not for metaphorical usage (e.g. “grasping the idea”).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Aziz-Zadeh, L., Wilson, S. M., Rizzolatti, G., &amp; Iacoboni, M. (2006). Congruent embodied representations for visually presented actions and linguistic phrases describing actions. Current Biology, 16(18), 1818-1823.&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that the assumption of embodied theories that abstract concepts, as well as concrete ones, are grounded in the sensorimotor system may not be true.

However, in contrast, other research has found motor cortex activation for the metaphorical usage of action verbs. One such study investigated cortical activation during comprehension of literal and idiomatic sentences using Magnetoencephalography (MEG). During a silent reading task, participants were presented with stimuli which included both literal and metaphorical arm-related action verbs, e.g. “Mary caught the fish” versus “Mary caught the sun”, and also literal and metaphorical leg-related action verbs, e.g. “Pablo jumped on the armchair” versus “Pablo jumped on the bandwagon”. This study found that processing of abstract verbs (idioms in this case) did indeed activate motor regions of the brain, activating anterior fronto-temporal activity very early compared to literal verbs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Boulenger, V., Shtyrov, Y., &amp; Pulvermüller, F. (2012). When do you grasp the idea? MEG evidence for instantaneous idiom understanding. Neuroimage, 59(4), 3502-3513.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embodied Semantics Using fMRI for Concrete and Abstract Words===
Hauk and colleagues found that reading words associated with foot, hand, or mouth actions (examples: kick, pick, lick) activated by motor areas adjacent or overlapping with areas activated by making actions with the hand, foot, or mouth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Additionally, neurolinguist Tettmanti and colleagues found that listening to action related sentences activated the premotor cortex in a somatotopic fashion.&lt;ref name="Rueschemeyer" /&gt; Example: leg sentences showed premotor activity dorsal to hand sentences dorsal to mouth sentences.

Aziz-Zadeh and colleagues localized foot, hand, and mouth premotor regions of interest in each subject by having subjects watch actions associated with each effector and read phrases associated with the foot, hand, and mouth. In each subject, regions most activated for watching a foot action were also most active for language related to foot actions. The same was true for the hand and mouth. Rizzolatti and colleagues have suggested that action plan (manipulating, reaching) is more important than the actual effector involved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other studies have investigated activation of the motor system during comprehension of concrete and abstract sentences. Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and a behavioural paradigm, one study investigated whether listening to action-related sentences activated activity within the motor cortices. This was investigated using Motor Evoked Potentials (MEPs) from the TMS which were recorded from hand muscles when stimulating the hand motor area, and from foot and leg muscles when stimulating the foot motor area. Participants were presented with sentences relating to hand or foot actions. As control, participants listened to sentences containing abstract content. The study found there was indeed activation of the motor cortices whilst listening to sentences expressing foot/leg and hand/arm actions. This activation specifically concerned the areas of the motor system ‘where the effector involved in the processed sentence is motorically represented’ (pp.&amp;nbsp;360). Specifically, the results showed that listening to hand-action-related sentences prompted a decrease of MEP amplitude recorded from hand muscles and listening to foot-action-related sentences prompted a decrease of MEP amplitude recorded from foot muscle.&lt;ref&gt;Buccino, G., Riggio, L., Melli, G., Binkofski, F., Gallese, V., &amp; Rizzolatti, G. (2005). Listening to action-related sentences modulates the activity of the motor system: a combined TMS and behavioral study. Cognitive Brain Research, 24(3), 355-363.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Embodied Semantics in BA44 ==
Aziz-Zadeh found that although both action observation and reading phrases about actions caused activity in premotor and prefrontal regions in the vicinity of Broca’s area, the activated regions largely did not overlap. Activations for reading phrases were anterior and medial to activations for action observation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Aziz-Zadeh’s research contradicts that of Hamzei who stressed the overlap of language and action observation activations in the inferior frontal gyrus. However, the difference in results most likely was due to the difference in language tasks. Hamzei used a verb generation task that caused widespread activation in the inferior frontal gyrus and the premotor cortex. The action observation task led to a small activation area within the larger activation area. Therefore, Hamzei noticed the overlap between areas. Aziz-Zadeh used a less extensive frontal activation task which allowed for areas activated by reading and by action observation to be clearly distinguished.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Action-Sentence Compatibility Effect (ACE)==
''See also:'' [[Bi-directional hypothesis of language and action|The Bi-Directional Hypothesis of Language and Action]]

Sentence processing can facilitate activation of motor systems based on the actions referred to in the sentence.  In one study, researchers asked participants to make judgments on whether a sentence was sensible or not.  For example, "You handed Courtney the notebook" versus "Courtney handed you the notebook".  They asked participants in one condition to push a button farther away from their body if the sentence was logical and a button close to their body when it wasn't logical.  The results of this study demonstrated that participants were faster at pushing the "sentence is logical" button when the action in the sentence matched the action required by them to push the correct button.&lt;ref name="Havas"&gt;Havas, D. A. et al. (2007). Emotion simulation during language comprehension. Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 14 (3), pp. 436−41.&lt;/ref&gt;  This means if the sentence read "you handed Courtney the notebook", the participants were faster to push the button that was farther away from them when this button meant the sentence was logical.   The depicted motion in these sentences affected the amount of time required to understand the sentences that described the motion that is in the same direction.  This effect has been shown to apply to sentences that describe concrete actions (putting a book on a shelf) as well as more abstract actions (you told the story to the policeman).&lt;ref name="GlenbergK"&gt;Glenberg, A. M, and M. Kaschak. (2002). Grounding Language in Action. Psychnomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 9 (3), pp. 558–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other studies have tried to understand the ACE phenomenon by examining the modulation of motor resonance during language comprehension. In one study participants were asked to read sentences containing a frame of between one and three words. The participants had to rotate a knob, in one direction for half of the experiment and in the other direction for the other half. Each 5° of rotation induced the presentation of a new frame. Each of the sentences described actions involving manual rotation. In these, the rotation direction would or would not match the rotation direction implied by the sentence. Earlier studies, such as that by Glenberg &amp; Kaschak (2002), examined motor resonance in responses to sentences presumably given after the sentence was read. In contrast, results of this study revealed that motor resonance had dissipated before the end of the sentence, with motor resonance occurring on the verb. This study made use of comprehension questions rather than sensibility sentences. The researchers have argued that this created a more naturalistic reading situation, so it could be argued that the results of this study are deemed more suitable because they are in regards to more naturalistic language. Overall, the researchers have concluded that motor resonance is quite immediate and short-lived and that duration of the effect is modified by linguistic context.&lt;ref&gt;Zwaan, R. A., &amp; Taylor, L. J. (2006). Seeing, acting, understanding: motor resonance in language comprehension. Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 135(1), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurophysiological evidence has also been presented to prove an ACE. This research used a behavioural paradigm as well as Event-Related Potential (ERP) to record brain activity, allowing the researchers to explore the neural brain markers of the ACE paradigm in semantic processing and motor responses. ERP was particularly beneficial in helping the researchers to investigate the [[Bi-directional hypothesis of language and action|bi-directional hypothesis of action-sentence comprehension]], which proposes that language processing facilitates movement and movement also facilitates language comprehension. In the study participants listened to sentences describing an action that involved an open hand, a closed hand or no manual action. They were then required to press a button to indicate their understanding of the sentence. Each participant was assigned a hand-shape, either closed or open, which was required to activate the button. As well as two groups (closed or open hand-shapes), there were three different categories relating to hand-shape: compatible, incompatible and neutral. Behavioural results from the study showed that participants responded quicker when the hand-shape required to press the response-button was compatible with the hand-shape inferred by the sentence. ERP results provided evidence to support the bi-directional hypothesis, showing that cortical markers of motor processes were affected by sentence meaning, therefore providing evidence for a semantics-to-motor effect. ERP results also demonstrated a motor-to-semantics effect as brain markers of comprehension were modified by motor effects.&lt;ref&gt;Aravena, P., Hurtado, E., Riveros, R., Cardona, J. F., Manes, F., &amp; Ibáñez, A. (2010). Applauding with closed hands: neural signature of action-sentence compatibility effects. PLoS One, 5(7), e11751.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Action-Compatibility Effect also states that the brain resources used to plan and carry out actions are also used in language comprehension; therefore, if an action implied in a sentence is different from the suggested response, there is interference within these brain resources.&lt;ref name = GlenbergK /&gt;

==Word Activation== 
Other studies have demonstrated that reading an object name interferes with how a person plans on grasping that object.&lt;ref name = Fischer&gt;Fischer, M., &amp; Zwann, R. (2008). Embodied language: A review of the role of the motor system in language comprehension. The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 61(6), 825–50. doi:10.1080/17470210701623605&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also found that similar words can prime similar actions.  Playing the piano and using a typewriter both utilize similar motor actions; these words prime each other in a word decision task.&lt;ref name = Fischer /&gt;  These studies have concluded that activation of motor decisions occur automatically when exposed to action-related words.&lt;ref name = Fischer /&gt;

== Metaphorical Language ==
Aziz-Zadeh investigated congruent somatotopic organization of semantic representations for metaphorical sentences in either hemisphere. Aziz-Zadeh presented subjects with stimuli such as “kick the bucket” or “bite the bullet” to read and then followed by presenting subjects with videos of hand, foot, and mouth actions. Evidence could not be found in either hemisphere to support this theory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The metaphors used in the experiment are common in the English language however. Therefore, the argument stands that if a metaphor is heard often enough it will not activate the same network of processing that it did initially.

==Actions emphasize meaning==
Many studies have shown how body movements and speech can be combined to emphasize meaning (often called [[gesturing]]).  A person can observe the actions of another to help them comprehend what that person is saying.&lt;ref name="Gibbs"&gt;Gibbs, R. W. (2006). Language and Communication. Embodiement and Cognitive Science, pp. 158–207.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, if a person is pointing repeatedly, it helps the listener to understand that the direction being inferred is very important; whereas if it was a casual point in the general direction, the location of the object may not be as necessary to comprehend what the speaker is saying.  Another example may be the stomping of one’s foot.  This can help the listener to understand the anger and frustration being conveyed by the speaker.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Implications==
Many studies have demonstrated that people’s understanding of words and sentences can influence their movements and actions as well as the opposite – peoples’ actions can influence how quickly they can comprehend a word or sentence.&lt;ref name="Paradowski2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB |title=Storytelling in language teaching – re-evaluating the weight of kinaesthetic modality for brain-compatible pedagogy |journal=Storytelling: An Interdisciplinary Journal |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=13–52 |year=2014 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10407960/Storytelling_in_language_teaching_re-evaluating_the_weight_of_kinaesthetic_modality_for_brain-compatible_pedagogy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This knowledge is important for many reasons. One study looked at the impact of embodied cognition in a classroom setting to facilitate and enhance language learning.  For a child, there is a difference between oral language learning and reading. In oral language learning, the mapping between a symbol (word) and the object is common – often brought about by gesturing to the object.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG&gt;Glenberg, A. M, and A. Goldberg. (2011). Improving early reading comprehension using embodied CAI. Instructional Science, 39 pp. 27–39. doi:10.1007/s11251-009-9096-7&lt;/ref&gt; However, when a child is learning to read, they focus on the letter-sound combinations and the correct pronunciation of the words.  Usually, the object the words are referring to, are not immediately connected with the word so an association between the word and object isn't immediately made.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  The researchers of this study suggest the ''Moved by Reading'' intervention which consists of two parts – Physical Manipulation stage and an Imagined Manipulation stage.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  In physical manipulation, the child reads a sentence and then is instructed to act out that sentence with available toys.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  This forces the child to connect words with objects and their actions. In the imagined manipulation stage, the child reads the sentence and is then asked to imagine how they would interact with toys to act out the sentence.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  They studied this further and discovered that it is possible for these children to still benefit from the effects of embodied cognition when they manipulate objects on a computer screen.&lt;ref name = GlenbergG /&gt;  This embodied cognition software can help children facilitate language comprehension.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} Other implications for language instruction that would enhance acquisition and retention are to offer activities which invite learners to actively use their body in the process, or at least observe the teacher doing so, thus activating their mirror neurons.&lt;ref name="Paradowski2014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15837">'''Explanatory style''' is a [[psychological]] attribute that indicates how people explain to themselves why they experience a particular event, either positive or negative. 

==Aspects==
===Personal===
This aspect covers the degree to which a person attributes an event to internal or external causes. An [[optimism|optimist]] might attribute a bad experience to luck whereas a [[pessimist]] might consider it his or her fault. Another person might also attribute an event to external forces in an unhealthy way (e.g. "I had no choice but to get violent.")

===Permanent===
This aspect covers characteristics considered stable versus unstable (across time). An optimist would tend to define his or her failures as unstable (I just didn't study enough for this particular test)  whereas a pessimist might think, for example, "I'm never good at tests".

===Pervasive=== 
This distinction covers global versus local and/or specific and the extent of the effect. A pessimist might, for example, think that "Everywhere there is misery" and an optimist think that, "I have had dealings mostly with honest people".

==Personality== 
People who generally tend to blame themselves for negative events, believe that such events will continue indefinitely, and let such events affect many aspects of their lives display what is called a ''[[pessimistic]] explanatory style''.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, Martin. Learned Optimism. New York, NY: Pocket Books. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, people who generally tend to blame outside forces for negative events, believe that such events will end soon, and do not let such events affect too many aspects of their lives display what is called an ''[[Learned optimism|optimistic]] explanatory style''.&lt;ref&gt;Seligman, Martin. Learned Optimism. New York, NY: Pocket Books. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, an individual does not necessarily show a uniform explanatory style in all aspects of life, but may exhibit varying responses to different types of events.

==Literature on attributional style==
Attributional style emerged from research on [[Depression (mood)|depression]], with [[Lyn Yvonne Abramson|Abramson]], [[Martin Seligman|Seligman]] and Teasdale (1978) arguing that a characteristic way of attributing negative outcomes{{spaced ndash}}to internal, stable and global causes{{spaced ndash}}would be associated with depression in response to negative events happened to them. As a [[diathesis–stress model]] of depression,&lt;ref name=robbins1995&gt;{{Cite book|first=C. J. |last=Robins |author2=A. M. Hayes |chapter=The role of causal attributions in the prediction of depression |editor=G. M. Buchanan and [[Martin Seligman|M. E. P.

A meta-analysis of 104 empirical studies of the theory indicates that the predictions are supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=P. D. |last=Sweeney |author2=K. Anderson |author3=S. Bailey |year=1986 |title=Attributional style in depression a meta-analytic review |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=50|issue=5 |pages=974–91 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.5.974 |pmid=3712233}} cited in {{Cite journal|first=L.

Those studies that have looked at attributions for hypothetical events have been more supportive of the model, possibly because these studies are more likely to have controlled for event severity.&lt;ref name=robbins1995/&gt;

The "[[learned helplessness]]" model formed the theoretical basis of the original Abramson, Seligman, and Teasdale statement on attributional style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=L. |last=Abrahamson |author2=Y. Seligman |author3=M. Teasdale |year=1978 |title=Learned Helplessness in Humans: Critique and Reformulation |journal=Abnormal Psychology |volume=87|issue=1 |pages=49–74 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.87.1.49 |pmid=649856}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Abramson, Metalsky and Alloy proposed a modified "hopelessness theory".&lt;ref name=Abramson1989/&gt; This distinguished hopeless depression and more circumscribed pessimism. It emphasizes the dimensions of stability and globality rather than internality, and suggests that stable and global attributions (rather than internal cause attributions) are associated with hopelessness depression. Hopelessness theory also highlights perceived importance and consequences of a negative outcome in addition to causal attributions as factors in clinical depression.

Developmentally, it has been suggested that attributional style originates in experiences of trust or lack of trust in events &lt;ref name=eisner1995&gt;{{Cite book|first=J. E. |last=Eisner |chapter=The origins of explanatory style: Trust as a determinant of pessimism and optimism |editor=G. M. Buchanan and [[Martin Seligman|M. E. P.

Trust in interpersonal relationships is argued to build an optimistic explanatory style.&lt;ref name=eisner1995/&gt;

=== Measurement ===
[[File:Liu Bates (2013) Model of Attributional Style.png|thumb|right|Liu Bates (2013) Model of Attributional Style]]
Attributional style is typically assessed using questionnaires such as the Attributional Style Questionnaire or ASQ,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=C. |last1=Peterson |author2=A. Semmel|author3=C. von Baeyer|author4=L. Abramson|author5=G. I. Metalsky |authorlink6=Martin Seligman|author6=M. E. P.

Villanova |year=1988 |title=An expanded Attributional Style Questionnaire |journal=[[Journal of Abnormal Psychology]] |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=87–89 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.97.1.87 |pmid=3351118}}&lt;/ref&gt; which assesses attributions for eighteen hypothetical negative events, and various scales that assess attributions for real events, such as the Real Events Attributional Style Questionnaire&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1521/jscp.1988.7.2-3.97|first=P. D. |last=Norman |author2=C. Antaki |year=1988 |title=Real events attributional style questionnaire |journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology |volume=7|issue=2–3 |pages=97–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Attributions Questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Elizabeth |last=Gong-Guy |author2=Constance Hammen |date=October 1980 |title=Causal perceptions of stressful events in depressed and nondepressed outpatients |journal=[[Journal of Abnormal Psychology]] |volume=89 |issue=5 |pages=662–669 |doi=10.1037/0021-843X.89.5.662 |pmid=7410726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these scales provide empirical methodology for study of attributional style, and considerable empirical data support the Abramson-Seligman-Teasdale model of depression, there has been dispute about whether this concept really exists. Cutrona, Russell and Jones, for example, found evidence for considerable cross-situational variation and temporal change of attributional style in women suffering from [[post-partum depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=C. E. |last=Cutrona |author2=D. Russell |author3=R. D. Jones |year=1984 |title=Cross-situational consistency in causal attributions: Does attributional style exist? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=47|issue=5 |pages=1043–58 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.47.5.1043}}&lt;/ref&gt; Xenikou notes, however, that Cutrona, Russell and Jones found more evidence for the cross-situational consistency of stability and globalism than of internalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=A. |last=Xenikou |author2=A. Furnham |author3=M. McCarrey |year=1997 |title=Attributional style for negative events: A proposition for a more valid and reliable measaure of attributional style |journal=British Journal of Psychology |volume=88 |pages=53–69 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1997.tb02620.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; More data in support of long-term stability of attributional style has come from a diary study by Burns and Seligman.&lt;ref name=burns1989&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Melanie O. |last=Burns |author2=M. E. P. Seligman |authorlink2=Martin Seligman  |date=March 1989 |title=Explanatory style across the life span: Evidence for stability over 52 years |journal=[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=471–77 |pmid=2926642 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.56.3.471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a technique called Content Analysis of Verbatim Explanation (CAVE),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ppc.sas.upenn.edu/cave.htm&lt;/ref&gt; these authors found stable patterns of attributional style over a long time period.&lt;ref name=burns1989/&gt;

Attributional style may be domain-specific. Using the Attributional Style Assessment Test, Anderson and colleagues found some evidence for domain-specificity  of style, for instance work-related attributions vs interpersonal attributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=C. A. |last=Anderson |author2=D. L. Jennings |author3=L. H. Arnoult |year=1988 |title=Validity and utility of the attributional style construct at a moderate level of specificity |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=55|issue=6 |pages=979–990 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.55.6.979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modelling of the items of the ASQ suggests that the positive and negative event information (e.g. getting a promotion, losing a job) and the causal nature of attributions - whether events are seen as global or local in scope, or as temporally stable or unstable, for instance - assess distinct factors. A global focus tends to emerge, for instance, independent of the valence of an event.&lt;ref name="Liu2014"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2014.03.022| title = The structure of attributional style: Cognitive styles and optimism–pessimism bias in the Attributional Style Questionnaire| journal = Personality and Individual Differences| volume = 66| pages = 79-85| year = 2014| last1 = Liu | first1 = C. | last2 = Bates | first2 = T. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such effects are found more broadly in cognition, where they are referred to as [[Global precedence|Global versus local precedence]]. Optimistic and Pessimistic attributions emerged as independent of each other, supporting models in which these styles have distinct genetic and environmental origins.

=== Relationship to other constructs ===
Attributional style is, at least superficially, similar to [[locus of control]]. However, the locus of control is concerned with expectancies about the future while attribution style is concerned with attributions for the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=A. |last=Furnham |author2=H. Steele |year=1993 |title=Measuring locus of control: a critique of general, children's health and work related locus of control questionnaires |journal=British Journal of Psychology |volume=84 |issue=4 |pages=443–79 |pmid=8298858 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1993.tb02495.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas locus of control cuts across both positive and negative outcomes, authors in the attributional style field have distinguished between a Pessimistic Explanatory Style, in which failures are attributed to internal, stable, and global factors and successes to external, unstable, and specific causes, and an Optimistic Explanatory Style, in which successes are attributed to internal, stable, and global factors and failures to external, unstable, and specific causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Gregory McClellan |last=Buchanan |author2=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13754">The '''"Faces of Freedom"''' photo exhibition is a collection of photographs captured by [[photo-journalist]], [[filmmaker]] and [[human rights]] [[educator]] [[Robin Romano|U. Roberto (Robin) Romano]], during his travels to [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Pakistan]]. Romano explores the exploitation of [[child labor]] in the production of handmade rugs in coordination with multiple international organizations, such as the [[World Bank]], [[UNICEF]], [[International Labour Organization]] and others to reduce the number of child laborers in that industry.  The exhibit has been shown in many United States cities since its first exhibit in 2009.  Faces of Freedom has been included in [[CNN]] Freedom Projects of [[Slavery#Contemporary slavery|modern slavery]].

==Child labor==
To combat exploitation of [[Child labour|child labor]], [[The World Bank]] with [[UNICEF]], [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) and Understanding Children's Work Initiative to bring awareness of the scope of the problem.  The World Bank estimates that there are 218 million children who are victim to unfair child labor practices.  The children's ages range from five to seventeen years of age.  The handmade rug industry is one of industries involved in exploitation of child labor.  The World Bank works with country-based and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in an effort to "combat child labor."&lt;ref name=TWB&gt;{{cite web |url=http://go.worldbank.org/CLQNYOJEE0 |title=Faces of Freedom - Visions of Hope for Child Laborers |author= |date=2009-12-16 |work=Topics, Children and Youth |publisher=The World Bank |accessdate=2011-05-27 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] and the [[International Labour Organization]] consider child labor exploitative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Worst Forms of Child Labor Recommendation, 1999 |work=International Labour Organization |url=http://www.ilo.org/ilolex/cgi-lex/convde.pl?R190 |accessdate=2006-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child |work=United Nations |url=http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |accessdate=2006-10-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003230539/http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |archivedate=2006-10-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the UN stipulating, in article 32 of the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] that:&lt;blockquote&gt;''...States Parties recognize the right of the child to be protected from economic exploitation and from performing any work that is likely to be hazardous or to interfere with the child's education, or to be harmful to the child's health or physical, mental, spiritual, moral or social development.''  Although globally there is an estimated 250 million children working.&lt;ref name="UN" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to the census in 1990 nearly 18% of all the children in America are working in different organizations. The Supreme Court banned child labor in 1916 but the law became visible in 1941. The labor department is also not paying attention to the child labor in USA therefore children are still employed in the organizations. The age of the children who are employed is between 15 years to 17 years. They are nearly 3.7 million children who work in different factories. There is an interesting fact that more than 600 children died in work related accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whatisusa.info/child-labor-in-usa|title=Child Labor in USA|publisher=What is USA News|date=15 April 2013 | accessdate=2012-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibit==
U. Roberto Romano, a photographer, filmmaker and humans right activist, traveled to [[India]], [[Nepal]] and [[Pakistan]] to record the plight of child laborers in the handmade rug industry.  He also gathered photographs and stories of children who have been rescued by the [[Rugmark|GoodWeave]] organization, previously known as Rugmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediavoicesforchildren.org/?p=55 |title=Rugmark |date=March 3, 2009 |publisher=Media Voices for Children |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediavoicesforchildren.org/?page_id=1027 |title=Faces of Freedom |year=2011 |publisher=Media Voices for Children |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faces of Freedom exhibit is a collection of photos by U. Roberto Romano that provides insight into the lives, poor living conditions and faces of child rug-weavers of South Asia. Messages of hope are portrayed in the photographs and stories of children that were assisted by the [[Rugmark|GoodWeave]] program to attain school education. A selection of handmade rugs made without child labor is also exhibited.&lt;ref name=TWB/&gt;&lt;ref name=STC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southtexascollege.edu/milagros/virtual_library.html |title=Photographic Documentaries, U.

In late 2010, the Faces of Freedom exhibit was featured the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[television network]] show [[Good Morning America]].  On April 18, 2011, Faces of Freedom was covered in CNN Freedom Project’s of [[Slavery#Contemporary slavery|modern slavery]]. The piece appears on [[CNN]] [http://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/ website] with a slideshow of images of [[Rugmark|GoodWeave’s]] Faces of Freedom photo exhibition.

'''Stolen Childhoods'''
:A feature documentary on global [[child labour|child labor]] exploitation affecting nearly 250 million children.  The film,  narrated by actress [[Meryl Streep]], covers factors affecting the children: working conditions, slavery, and bonded labor. Children's stories from eight countries, including the United States, tell of children exposed to pesticides, chained to their work areas, and even kidnapped and forced into slavery or prostitution.  In addition to providing background for why this occurs and implications to the global community, it also offers hope through stories of children's lives have been saved and what actions can be taken to combat child labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stolenchildhoods.org/mt/archives/2005/03/full_synopsis.php |title=Stolen Childhoods |author=Chris Mara |date=May 3, 2005 |work=Full Synopsis |publisher=Stolen Childhoods |accessdate=2011-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fairtrade Certification Mark.svg|thumb|[[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]]]]

The '''Fairtrade certification''' initiative was created to form a new method for [[trade|economic trade]]. This method takes an ethical standpoint, and considers the [[Producer (agriculture)|producers]] first.

Several attempts to market fair trade products were observed in the 1960s and 1970s, fair trade sales became widespread with the Max Havelaar labeling initiative in 1988 and the establishment of Fairtrade International in 1997. Fairtrade sales prior to labeling initiatives were contained to relatively small world shops (also called charity shops), operated by alternative trading organizations (ATOs) such as Oxfam and Traidcraft.

At the initiative of Mexican coffee farmers, the first fair trade labeling initiative, Stichting Max Havelaar, was launched in the Netherlands on November 15, 1988, by Nico Roozen, Frans van der Hoff, and Dutch ecumenical development agency Solidaridad. In 1992, the organization was founded by Michael Gidney. The initiative offered coffee producers following various social and environmental standards an above market price for their crop. The coffee, originating from the UCIRI cooperative in Mexico, was imported by Dutch company Van Weely, roasted by Neuteboom, sold directly to shops and, for the first time, to mainstream retailers across the Netherlands.

The initiative was groundbreaking as for the first time Fairtrade coffee was being offered to a larger consumer segment. Fairtrade labeling certification provided some assurance that the products were really benefiting the farm workers at the end of the supply chain.

Fairtrade International started with the coffee industry, but now covers a range of products such as [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[fruit]], [[cotton]], [[flower]]s, [[tea]] and others. The established buyers of these products make up a [[niche market]], which makes marketing for Fairtrade a challenge.

As of 2016, 1,411 producer organizations in 73 developing countries were Fairtrade certified, representing over 1.66 million [[farmers]] and workers. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monitoringreport2017.fairtrade.net/en/|title=Monitoring the Scope and Benefits of Fairtrade: Impact Report 2017 - Fairtrade Monitoring Report - 9th Edition|website=Fairtrade Monitoring Report - 9th Edition|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The fair trade movement stemmed from an initiative established by the Dutch development agency, Solidaridad, and aimed to create more equality between coffee producers and roasters. The agency recognized that the producers were not being treated fairly, and strived to create a more ethical system to trade. 

The Max Havelaar seal, which was based on a fictional character, was established "to license existing roasters and retailers who complied with its fair trade criteria".The seal provided specific benefits for cooperatives of small coffee producers in Mexico, with the aim of balancing the production of crops to be exported, as well as crops for the local population. The four benefits in this early model of the fairtrade initiative were:

#  A guaranteed minimum price to protect producers from any potential falls in the global market.
#  An additional 10% of the market price for their investment in social and environmental projects.
#  A 60% advance to producers to reduce the pressure of selling their product "immediately after harvest when its price is lowest"
#  A commitment by roasters to eliminate any other parties within the supply chain, with the aim of dealing more directly with producers.
The initiative was a great financial success and was replicated in several other markets: in the ensuing years, similar non-profit Fairtrade labelling organizations were set up in other European countries and North America, called "Max Havelaar" (in [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[France]]), "Transfair" (in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Italy]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Japan]]), or carrying a national name: "Fairtrade Mark" in the [[UK]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], "Rättvisemärkt" in [[Sweden]], and "Reilu kauppa" (Finnish) or "Rejäl handel" ([[Finland Swedish|Swedish]]) in [[Finland]].

Initially, while the Max Havelaars and the Transfairs co-operated product by product with equivalent standards and producer lists there was no contractual agreement to ensure global standards. In 1994, a process of convergence among the labelling organizations&amp;nbsp;– or "LIs" (for "Labelling Initiatives")&amp;nbsp;– started with the establishment of a TransMax working group, culminating in 1997 in the creation of [[Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International]], now simply known as Fairtrade International (FLO). FLO is an umbrella organization whose mission is to set the Fairtrade Standards, support, inspect and certify disadvantaged producers and harmonize the Fairtrade message across the movement.

In 2002, FLO launched a new [[International Fairtrade Certification Mark]], effectively replacing most previous Max Havelaar and TransFair certification marks. The goals of the launch were to improve the visibility of the Mark on supermarket shelves, facilitate cross-border trade and simplify export procedures for both producers and exporters.

Today, all but one labeling initiative have fully adopted the new mark. [[TransFair USA]] has apparently elected to continue with its own [[Fair Trade Certified Mark]] for the time being,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transfairusa.org/content/resources/faq-advanced.php#bluegreen TransFair USA FAQ] - "TransFair USA, has elected to continue using its current label."&lt;/ref&gt; while the Canadian organization currently allows certified products to carry either mark, it is transitioning toward the sole use of the International Fairtrade Certification Mark.

In January 2004, Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International was divided into two independent organizations: Fairtrade International (FLO), which sets Fairtrade Standards and provides producer business support, and FLO-CERT, which inspects and certifies producer organizations. The aim of the split was to ensure the impartiality, the independence of the certification process and compliance with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 65 standards for product certification bodies.

At present, over 25 labelling initiatives and producer networks are members or associate members of Fairtrade International. There are now FAIRTRADE Certification Marks on dozens of different products, based on FLO's certification for coffee, [[tea]], [[rice]], [[banana]]s, [[mango]]es, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[cotton]], [[sugar]], [[honey]], [[fruit juice]]s, [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[fruit|fresh fruit]], [[quinoa]], [[herb]]s and [[spice]]s, [[wine]] and [[Football (ball)|footballs]].

In 2009, fair trade coffee was sufficiently mainstream that [[Walmart]], the world's largest retailer began selling it, and pricing it about the same as regular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505144_162-51372457/what-to-buy-at-walmart/ What to Buy at Walmart] 2009; revised 2011; accessed 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fairtrade and Fairmined dual certification for [[gold]] was launched across the United Kingdom on 14 February 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/14/fairtrade-gold?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Fairtrade hallmark sets the gold standard|author=Kate Carter|date=14 February 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a joint scheme between [[The Fairtrade Foundation]] and [[The Association for Responsible Mining]].

==The global market==

The Solidaridad informed large audiences of the mistreatment of coffee producers and poor living conditions in developing countries. They worked with other associations as well as the mass media to spread the message and create an awareness of their fair trade initiative. Because of their efforts, in 1988 the first bag of Max Hevelaar sealed coffee from Mexico was delivered to Holland's Prince Claus, and was launched to be sold in supermarkets throughout Holland. By the 1990s every western European country had established their own national version of the Max Hevelaar initiative.

Between the late 1980s and the mid-1990s, multiple national initiatives following a fair trade system coexisted within Europe, the US, Canada, and Japan.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Nicholls, A., &amp; Opal, C. (2005). Fairtrade certification. In ''Fair trade: Market-driven ethical consumption'' (p. 128). London.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, however, 17 national initiatives joined forces to create one international umbrella organisation called the Fair Trade Organization (FLO). FLO is based in Bonn, Germany, and has quickly become the largest organisation of its kind.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; FLO also has branches and field workers in Africa, Central and South America and China.  The international fair trade label was introduced in 2002 to improve visibility for consumers. The Fairtrade producers did not like the way they were treated.

==Marketing fair trade==
A key part of the fair trade initiative is to inform consumers through innovative marketing. The marketing must create a value proposition for the initiative that encompasses the ethical side, as well as the quality of the product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

==How it works==
As an example: [[fair trade]] coffee packers in developed countries pay a fee to their country's Fairtrade organization for the right to use the brand and logo. Nearly the entire fee goes to marketing. Packers and retailers can charge as much as they want for the coffee. The coffee has to come from a certified Fairtrade cooperative, which pays certification and inspection fees. The importer is obliged to pay the exporter a base price which keeps the price from sinking below that level. It is sometimes higher than the going world price, but at times when coffee prices are high, it may be lower than the going price. There is an additional "producer premium" (20c/lb for coffee). For a few products, like coffee, there is also a minimum price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|title=Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations|date=April 1, 2011|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf |page=4|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cooperatives or other Fairtrade certified firms incur additional costs including increased marketing costs, certification and inspection fees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/35.html|title=Fee System Small Producer Organization - Explanatory Document|year=2011|publisher=FLO-CERT Gmbh|accessdate= January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and costs of conforming to the specifications.

Any deficit after paying these costs means a lower price for farmers, while any surplus from the premium price must be spent on "social projects" for "common goals" organized by the exporting cooperative rather than being an extra payment for farmers.&lt;ref name="EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|title=Fairtrade Standard for Coffee for Small Producer Organizations|date=April 1, 2011|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-01_EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf |accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.

Retrieved January 3, 2013, from Fairtrade International: http://www.fairtrade.net/coffee.html.&lt;/ref&gt; These may include the building of classrooms, baseball pitches, or the establishment of women's groups.

Fairtrade farmers have to meet a large range of criteria on production: there are limits on using child labour, pesticides, herbicides, genetically modified products and so on.&lt;ref name="GTS_EN.pdf p11"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V. |date=April 2, 2012 |title=Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard |page=11 |url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |accessdate=January 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf |archivedate=May 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairtrade standards==
[[File:FairtradeCertifiedCottonTShirt.jpg|thumb|275px|right|A T-shirt made from Fairtrade certified cotton]]

Fairtrade standards contain minimum requirements that all producer organizations must meet to become certified as well as progress requirements in which producers must demonstrate improvements over time. To become certified Fairtrade producers, the cooperatives and their member farmers must operate to certain standards laid down by Fairtrade International. FLO-CERT, the for-profit side, handles producer certification, inspecting and certifying producer organizations in more than 50 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="FLOCERT"&gt;FLO-CERT (2008). [http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en FLO-CERT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918131636/http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/main.php?lg=en |date=2009-09-18 }}. URL accessed on August 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several types of Fairtrade standards, including standards for contract situations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|title=Fairtrade standard for Contract Production|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-09-25_CP_EN.pdf|date=September 25, 2012|accessdate=January 23, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510191206/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-09-25_CP_EN.pdf|archivedate=May 10, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for importers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|date=April 2, 2012|title=Generic Fairtrade Trade Standard|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 15, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502051837/http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-04-02_GTS_EN.pdf|archivedate=May 2, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also for the different products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our standards|url=https://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/List_of_Fairtrade_Standards.pdf|website=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International|publisher=|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade standards for small farmers' organizations include requirements for [[democracy|democratic]] decision making, so that farmers may have a say in how the Fairtrade Premiums are invested. They also include requirements for capacity building and economic strengthening of the organization.&lt;ref name="SPO_EN.pdf"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.|date=July 11, 2011|title=Fairtrade Standard for Small Producer Organizations|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-07-11_SPO_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade standards for hired labour situations specify that employees receive minimum wages and [[collective bargaining]]. The standards also specify that Fairtrade-certified [[plantation]]s should have no forced or [[child labour]] and that health and safety requirements are met. In a hired labour situation, Fairtrade standards require a "joint body" to be set up with representatives from both the management and the employees. This joint body decides on how Fairtrade Premiums will be spent to benefit [[plantation]] employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade International|date=December 29, 2011|title=Fairtrade standard for Hired Labour|url=
http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2011-12-29-HL_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade standards and procedures are approved by the Fairtrade International Standards Committee, an external committee comprising all FLO stakeholders (labeling initiatives, producers and traders) and external experts. Fairtrade standards are set by FLO in accordance to the requirements of the ISEAL Code of Good Practice in standard setting and are in addition the result of a consultation process, involving a variety of stakeholders: producers, traders, external experts, inspectors, and certification staff.&lt;ref&gt;Fairtrade International (2006). [http://www.fairtrade.net/standard_setting.html Standard Setting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925031518/http://www.fairtrade.net/standard_setting.html |date=2006-09-25 }}. Accessed October 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fairtrade pricing==

The main aspects of the Fairtrade system are the Minimum Price and the Premium. These are paid to the exporting firm, usually a second tier cooperative, not to the farmer. They are not paid for everything produced by the cooperative members, but for that proportion of their output they are able to sell with the brand 'Fairtrade Certified', typically 17% of their turnover, rising to as much as 60% in a few cases.
* The '''Fairtrade Premium''' is an extra payment over the market price (e.g. an extra 20c/lb for coffee) which is paid to the exporting organization. The residual after extra costs incurred in producing and marketing Fairtrade have been met must be spent on "social projects"  for social and economic development in the producing communities, rather than being given to farmers as extra payment.&lt;ref name="EN_SPO_Coffee.pdf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SPO_EN.pdf p28"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Fairtrade Labelling Organizations International e.V.|date=July 11, 2011|title=Fairtrade Standard for Small Producer Organizations|url=http://www.fairtrade.net/fileadmin/user_upload/content/2009/standards/documents/2012-07-11_SPO_EN.pdf|accessdate=January 3, 2013|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The producers themselves decide how these funds are to be spent. They are generally used for improvements in [[health]], [[education]] or other social facilities, although it may also be used for certain development projects to enable farmers to improve productivity or reduce their reliance on single commodities. Fairtrade producer organizations are required to be able to show what happened to the money, and FLO-CERT should check whether they have such a system in place. 
* The '''Fairtrade Minimum Price''' is a guaranteed price to be paid for a few products like coffee when the world prices collapse. Again, it would usually be spent on "social projects" rather than going to the farmers.

==Fairtrade inspection and certification==

Fairtrade inspection and certification are carried out by [[FLO-CERT]], an independent, for-profit body created by Fairtrade International. FLO-CERT certifies that both producers and traders have met with Fairtrade standards.FLO-CERT inspections and certification follow the international ISO standards for product certification bodies (ISO 65).&lt;ref name="flo-cert.net"&gt;[http://www.flo-cert.net/flo-cert/35.html FLO-CERT Gmbh, (2011) Fee System Small Producer Organization - Explanatory Document. www.flo-cert.net, Retrieved January 3, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

FLO-CERT works with a network of around 100 independent inspectors that regularly visit producer and trade organizations and report back to FLO-CERT. All certification decisions are then taken by a Certification Committee, composed of stakeholders from producers, traders, national labelling organisations and external experts. An Appeals Committee handles all appeals.

In 2006, a ''[[Financial Times]]'' journalist found that ten out of the ten mills they visited had sold uncertified coffee to co-operatives as certified. It reported that they were "also handed evidence of at least one coffee association that received Fairtrade certification despite illegally growing some 20 per cent of its coffee in protected national forest land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weitzman|first1=Hal|title=The bitter cost of ‘fair trade’ coffee|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d191adbc-3f4d-11db-a37c-0000779e2340|accessdate=18 January 2018|work=An emerging criticism of Fairtrade within the industry is that the organisation misleads consumers about its ability to monitor production practices. FLO Cert, a body officially independent of FLO, monitors the certification process. Critics say there is a need for an outside auditor. “The way Fairtrade promotes itself is a little irresponsible,” says Mr Watts. “The certifiers need an external watchdog.”|agency=Financial Times|publisher=The Financial Times Ltd.|date=9 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification costs and returns==

Certified organizations such as cooperatives have to pay FLO-CERT a fee to become certified and a further annual fee for audit and continued certification&lt;ref name="flo-cert.net" /&gt; The first year certification fee per unit sold as "Fairtrade certified"  varies but has been over 6c/lb with an annual fee of 3c/lb to 3.4c/lb for coffee up to 2006 in some countries, at a time when the "Fairtrade premium" was 5c to 10c/lb.&lt;ref&gt;de Janvry, A., McIntosh, C., &amp; Sadoulet, E. (2010). Fair Trade and Free Entry:The Dissipation of Producer Benefits in a Disequilibrium Market. Retrieved December 24, 2012, from http://are.berkeley.edu/~alain/workingpapers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairtrade farmers also have to meet a large range of criteria on production: there are limits on using child labour, pesticides, herbicides, genetically modified products and so on.&lt;ref name="GTS_EN.pdf p11" /&gt;

'''Father Time''' is the [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] depiction of [[time]].

==Description==
Father Time is usually depicted as an elderly bearded man with [[wings]], dressed in a robe and carrying a [[scythe]] and an [[hourglass]] or other timekeeping device (which represents [[arrow of time|time's]] constant one-way movement, and more generally and abstractly, [[entropy]]). This image derives from several sources, including the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] and the misattribution of [[Cronus]] (not [[Chronos]]) as the Greek Titan of human time, reaping and calendars, or the Lord of Time.

Around New Year's Eve, the media (in particular [[editorial cartoons]]) use the convenient [[Trope (literature)|trope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mike Luckovich Copyright 2010 Creators Syndicate |url=http://theweek.com/section/cartoon/0/210634/all-cartoons |title=Father time takes a beating – Foreign Relations Political and Editorial Cartoons |publisher=The Week |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Father Time as the personification of the previous year (or "the Old Year") who typically "hands over" the duties of time to the equally allegorical [[Baby New Year]] (or "the New Year") or who otherwise characterizes the preceding year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cartoonistgroup.com/bysubject/subjectbyartist.php?id=92&amp;sid=6259M |title=The Father Time Comics and Cartoons – Cartoonist Group – Lisa Benson's Editorial Cartoons |publisher=Cartoonist Group |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dePIXion studios www.depixion.com |url=http://editorialcartoonists.com/cartoon/display.cfm/94366/ |title=AAEC – Political Cartoons |publisher=Editorialcartoonists.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308211042/http://editorialcartoonists.com/cartoon/display.cfm/94366/ |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these depictions, Father Time is usually depicted wearing a sash with the old year's date on it.

Time (in his allegorical form) is often depicted revealing or unveiling the allegorical Truth, sometimes at the expense of a personification of Falsehood, Fraud, or Envy. This theme is related to the idea of ''veritas filia temporis'' (Time is the father of Truth).

==In popular culture==
Father Time is an established symbol in numerous cultures, and appears in a variety of art and media. In some cases, they appear specifically as Father Time, while in other cases they may have another name (such as [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]]) but the characters demonstrate the attributes which Father Time has acquired over the centuries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3742">[[Mean field theory]] gives sensible results as long as one is able to neglect fluctuations in the system under consideration. The '''Ginzburg criterion''' tells quantitatively when mean field theory is valid. It also gives the idea of an
[[Critical dimension#Upper critical dimension in field theory|upper critical dimension]], a dimensionality of the system above which mean field theory gives proper results, and the critical exponents predicted by mean field theory match exactly with those obtained by numerical methods.

==Example: Ising model==
If &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Phase transition#Order parameters|order parameter]] of the system, then mean field theory requires that the fluctuations in the order parameter are much smaller than the actual value of the order parameter near the critical point.

Quantitatively, this means that &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/706803528|title=Statistical mechanics.|last=K.|first=Pathria, R.|date=2011|publisher=Academic Press|others=Beale, Paul D.|year=|isbn=9780123821881|edition=3rd|location=Boston|pages=460|oclc=706803528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mathcal \langle(\delta \phi)^2\rangle \quad{ \ll }\quad \langle\phi\rangle^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Using this in the [[Landau theory]], which is identical to the mean field theory for the [[Ising model]], the value of the upper critical dimension comes out to be 4. If the dimension of the space is greater than 4, the mean-field results are good and self-consistent. But for dimensions less than 4, the predictions are less accurate. For instance, in one dimension, the mean field approximation predicts a phase transition at finite temperatures for the Ising model, whereas the exact analytic solution in one dimension has none (except for &lt;math&gt;T=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T\rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt;).

==Example: Classical Heisenberg model==
In the [[classical Heisenberg model]] of magnetism, the order parameter has a higher symmetry, and it has violent directional fluctuations which are more important than the size fluctutions.
They overtake to the [[Ginzbug interval|Ginzburg temperature interval]] over which fluctuations modify the mean-field  description thus replacing the criterion by another, more relevant one.

In [[mathematical logic]], a '''judgment''' (or '''judgement''') or '''assertion''' is a statement or enunciation in the [[metalanguage]]. For example, typical judgments in [[first-order logic]] would be ''that a string is a [[well-formed formula]]'', or ''that a proposition is true''. Similarly, a judgment may assert the occurrence of a [[free variable]] in an expression of the object language, or the provability of a [[proposition]]. In general, a judgment may be any inductively definable assertion in the [[metatheory]].

Judgments are used in formalizing [[Formal system|deduction systems]]: a [[logical axiom]] expresses a judgment, premises of a [[rule of inference]] are formed as a [[sequence]] of judgments, and their conclusion is a judgment as well (thus, hypotheses and conclusions of proofs are judgments). A characteristic feature of the variants of [[Hilbert-style deduction system]]s is that the ''context'' is not changed in any of their rules of inference, while both [[natural deduction]] and [[sequent calculus]] contain some context-changing rules. Thus, if we are interested only in the [[Logical consequence|derivability]] of [[Tautology (logic)|tautologies]], not hypothetical judgments, then we can formalize the Hilbert-style deduction system in such a way that its rules of inference contain only judgments of a rather simple form. The same cannot be done with the other two deductions systems: as context is changed in some of their rules of inferences, they cannot be formalized so that hypothetical judgments could be avoided—not even if we want to use them just for proving derivability of tautologies.

This basic diversity among the various calculi allows such difference, that the same basic thought (e.g. [[deduction theorem]]) must be proven as a [[metatheorem]] in [[Hilbert-style deduction system]], while it can be declared explicitly as a [[rule of inference]] in [[natural deduction]].

In [[type theory]], some analogous notions are used as in [[mathematical logic]] (giving rise to connections between the two fields, e.g. [[Curry-Howard correspondence]]). The abstraction in the notion of ''judgment'' in mathematical logic can be exploited also in foundation of type theory as well.

==Logical assertion==
In [[logic]], '''logical assertion''' is a statement that [[Speech act#Classifying illocutionary speech acts|asserts]] that a certain [[premise]] is true, and is useful for statements in proof. It is equivalent to a [[sequent]] with an empty [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]].

For example, if ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;"''x''&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;even", the implication
:&lt;math&gt; (\vdash p)\rightarrow(x \pmod 2 \equiv 0)&lt;/math&gt;
is thus true. We can also write this using the logical [[Turnstile (symbol)|assertion symbol]], as
:&lt;math&gt; \vdash \left( (\vdash p)\rightarrow(x \pmod 2 \equiv 0) \right)&lt;/math&gt;

In computer programming and [[Semantics (computer science)|programming language semantics]], these are used in the form of [[assertion (computing)|assertions]]; one example is a [[loop invariant]].

In [[informal logic]] and [[argument map]]ping, a '''lemma''' is simultaneously a [[main contention|contention]] for [[premise]]s below it and a premise for a contention above it. [[Transitive relation|Transitivity]]: If one has proof that ''B'' follows from ''A'' and proof that ''C'' follows from ''B'', then one has proof that ''C'' follows from ''A''.

'''Level of invention''' (or ''degree of inventiveness'', or ''level of solution'', or ''rank of solution'', or ''rank of invention'') is a [[comparative|relative degree]] of changes to the previous [[system]] (or solution) in the result of solution of [[inventive problem]] (one containing a [[contradiction]]). Term was defined and introduced by [[TRIZ]] author [[G. S. Altshuller]].

After initially reviewing 200,000 patent abstracts, Altshuller selected 40,000 as representatives of high level inventive solutions. The remainder involved direct improvements easily recognized within the specialty of the system.

Altshuller separated the patents' different degrees of [[Inventive step and non-obviousness|inventiveness]] into five levels:
* Level 1 – Routine design problems solved by methods well known within the specialty. Usually no invention needed. 
:example: use of coal for writing
* Level 2 – Minor improvements to an existing system using methods known within the industry. 
:example: graphite [[pencil]] (wrapped coal stick)
* Level 3 – Fundamental improvement to an existing system using methods known outside the industry. 
:example: ink [[pen]] (ink instead of coal)
* Level 4 – A new generation of a system that entails a new principle for performing the system's primary functions. Solutions are found more often in science than technology. 
:example: [[Computer printer|printer]] (another whole system for writing)
* Level 5 – A rare scientific discovery or pioneering invention of an essentially new system. 
:example: electronic pen&amp;paper (see [http://www.anoto.com Anoto])

These levels of invention are applied to solutions rather than problems requiring a system of solution.

Also '''level of invention''' and the '''potential for innovation''' in any nation, geographical area or economic activity is as measurement in the concept of ''[[innovative capacity]]'' originally introduced by Prof. Suarez-Villa in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.innovativecapacity.com/publications-LSV.htm |title=publications-LSV |first=Luis |last=Suarez-Villa |work=innovativecapacity.com |year=2011 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''map–territory relation''' describes the relationship between an object and a representation of that [[Object (philosophy)|object]], as in the relation between a geographical territory and a [[map]] of it. Polish-American scientist and philosopher [[Alfred Korzybski]] remarked that "the map is not the territory" and that "the word is not the thing", encapsulating his view that an [[abstraction]] derived from something, or a reaction to it, is not the thing itself. Korzybski held that many people do confuse maps with territories, that is, confuse [[conceptual model|models]] of reality with reality itself.  The relationship has also been expressed in other terms, such as [[Alan Watts]]'s "The menu is not the meal."

=="A map is not the territory"==
The expression first appeared in print in "A Non-Aristotelian System and its Necessity for Rigour in Mathematics and Physics", a paper that Alfred Korzybski gave at a meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] on December 28, 1931. The paper was reprinted in ''Science and Sanity'', 1933, pp. 747–61.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Korzybski |first=Alfred |authorlink=Alfred Korzybski |title=Science and Sanity.

The Belgian [[surrealist]] artist [[René Magritte]] illustrated the concept of "perception always intercedes between reality and ourselves"&lt;ref&gt;Rene Magritte's surrealism to be to illustrate the point that, "perception always intercedes between reality and ourselves". See for example, p.&amp;nbsp;15-16 [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0791434354&amp;id=ZiTpRxkTMwUC&amp;vq=korzybski&amp;dq=Korzybski%2BMagritte&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;pg=PA16&amp;sig=hZWrqDZMqGm7tKpdQfkhM-rCOQY Visual Intelligence: Perception, Image, and Manipulation in Visual Communication] by Ann Marie Barry ([http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/communication/faculty/fulltime/barry/ bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129012811/http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/communication/faculty/fulltime/barry/ |date=2005-11-29 }})&lt;/ref&gt; in a number of paintings including a famous work entitled ''[[The Treachery of Images]]'', which consists of a drawing of a pipe with the caption, ''Ceci n'est pas une pipe'' ("This is not a pipe").

In ''[[The Medium Is the Message]]'', [[Marshall McLuhan]] expanded this argument to electronic media.  Media representations, especially on screens, are abstractions, or virtual "extensions" of what our sensory channels, bodies, thinking and feeling do for us in real life.

This concept occurs in the discussion of exoteric and esoteric [[religion]]s. [[Exoteric]] concepts are concepts which can be fully conveyed using [[Epithet|descriptors]] and [[language]] constructs, such as [[mathematics]]. [[Esoteric]] concepts are concepts which cannot be fully conveyed except by direct experience. For example, a person who has never tasted an [[apple]] will never fully understand through language what the taste of an apple is. Only through direct experience (eating an apple) can that experience be fully understood.

[[Lewis Carroll]], in ''[[Sylvie and Bruno Concluded]]'' (1893), made the point humorously with his description of a fictional map that had "the scale of a mile to the mile". A character notes some practical difficulties with such a map and states that "we now use the [[country]] itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well."

[[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s one-paragraph short story "[[On Exactitude in Science]]" (1946) also describes a map that has the same scale as its territory, here an entire empire where cartography has become exactingly precise.

[[Laura Riding]], in her poem ''The Map of Places'' (1927), deals with this relation: "The map of places passes. The reality of paper tears."

The [[University of Cambridge]] economist [[Joan Robinson]] (1962) emphasized the disutility of 1:1 maps and other overly detailed models: "A model which took account of all the variation of reality would be of no more use than a map at the scale of one to one."

Korzybski's argument about the map and the territory also influenced the Belgian [[surrealist]] writer of comics [[Jan Bucquoy]] for a storyline in his comic ''Labyrinthe'': a map can never guarantee that one will find the way out, because the accumulation of events can change the way one looks at reality.

Historian of religions [[Jonathan Z. Smith|J. Z. Smith]] wrote a book entitled ''Map Is not Territory: Studies in the History of Religions'' (1978, [[University of Chicago Press]] 1993 paperback: {{ISBN|0-226-76357-9}}).

Author [[Robert M. Pirsig]] uses the idea both theoretically and literally in his book ''[[Lila: An Inquiry into Morals|Lila]]'' when the main character/author becomes temporarily lost due to an over reliance on a map, rather than the territory that the map describes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M Pirsig ''Lila: An Inquiry into Morals'' (1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;363-364)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, French author [[Michel Houellebecq]] published his novel, ''La carte et le territoire'', translated into English as ''[[The Map and the Territory]]''. The title was a reference to Alfred Korzybski's [[aphorism]]. The novel was awarded the French literary prize, the [[Prix Goncourt]].

[[Robert Anton Wilson]], in his book ''[[Prometheus Rising]]'', also makes this point about the map not being reality. He explicitly attempts to explain this important principle to the reader.

The mathematician James A. Lindsay made the idea that the map is not reality a primary theme of his 2013 book ''Dot, Dot, Dot: Infinity Plus God Equals Folly''. In it, he argues that all of our scientific theories, mathematics, and even the idea of God are conceptual maps often confused "for the terrain" they attempt to explain. In a foreword to the book, physicist [[Victor J. Stenger]] expresses agreement with this point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, James A. (2013). ''Dot, Dot, Dot: Infinity Plus God Equals Folly'', Fareham: Onus Books&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Ugly Duckling Presse published a book of poetry by Marília Garcia called ''The Territory Is Not the Map'', translated from the Portuguese (''O país não é o mapa'') by Hilary Kaplan. 

[[Yuval Noah Harari]]'s 2018 book, [[21 Lessons for the 21st Century]], has a description of people following directions from their navigation software and driving into the ocean.   

==Relationship==
[[Gregory Bateson]], in "Form, Substance and Difference", from ''[[Steps to an Ecology of Mind]]'' (1972), argued the essential impossibility of knowing what any actual territory is.  Any understanding of any territory is based on one or more sensory channels reporting adequately but imperfectly:

{{quote|We say the map is different from the territory. But what is the territory? Operationally, somebody went out with a retina or a measuring stick and made representations which were then put on paper. What is on the paper map is a representation of what was in the retinal representation of the man who made the map; and as you push the question back, what you find is an infinite regress, an infinite series of maps. The territory never gets in at all. […] Always, the process of representation will filter it out so that the mental world is only maps of maps, ''[[ad infinitum]]''.}}

Elsewhere in that same volume, Bateson argued that the usefulness of a map (a representation of reality) is not necessarily a matter of its literal truthfulness, but its having a [[structure]] analogous, for the purpose at hand, to the territory. Bateson argued this case at some length in the essay ''The Theology of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]''.

To paraphrase Bateson's argument, a culture that believes that [[common colds]] are transmitted by evil spirits, that those spirits fly out of you when you sneeze, can pass from one person to another when they are inhaled or when both handle the same objects, etc., could have just as effective a "map" for public health as one that substituted microbes for spirits.

Another basic quandary is the problem of [[accuracy]]. Jorge Luis Borges' "On Exactitude in Science" describes the tragic uselessness of the perfectly accurate, one-to-one map:

{{quote|In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guild drew a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, coinciding point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography saw the vast Map to be Useless and permitted it to decay and fray under the Sun and winters.

In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of the Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; and in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.}}

A more extreme literary example, the fictional [[Paradoxes of set theory#The diary of Tristram Shandy|diary of Tristram Shandy]] is so detailed that it takes the author one ''year'' to set down the events of a single ''day'' – because the map (diary) is more detailed than the territory (life), yet must fit into the territory (diary written in the course of his life), it can never be finished. Such tasks are referred to as [[supertask]]s.

With this  quotation of Josiah Royce, Borges describes a further conundrum of when the map is contained within the territory, you are led into [[infinite regress]]:

{{quote
|text=The inventions of philosophy are no less fantastic than those of art: [[Josiah Royce]], in the first volume of his work ''The World and the Individual'' (1899), has formulated the following: 'Let us imagine that a portion of the soil of England has been levelled off perfectly and that on it a cartographer traces a map of England. The job is perfect; there is no detail of the soil of England, no matter how minute, that is not registered on the map; everything has there its correspondence. This map, in such a case, should contain a map of the map, which should contain a map of the map of the map, and so on to infinity.' Why does it disturb us that the map be included in the map and the thousand and one nights in the book of the ''Thousand and One Nights''? Why does it disturb us that Don Quixote be a reader of the ''Quixote'' and Hamlet a spectator of ''Hamlet''? I believe I have found the reason: these inversions suggest that if the characters of a fictional work can be readers or spectators, we, its readers or spectators, can be fictions.
|author=Jorge Luis Borges
|source=''[[Partial Enchantments of the Quixote]]'' (1964)}}

[[Neil Gaiman]] retells the parable in reference to [[storytelling]] in ''[[Fragile Things]]'' (it was originally to appear in ''[[American Gods]]''):

{{quote|One describes a tale best by telling the tale. You see? The way one describes a story, to oneself or the world, is by telling the story. It is a balancing act and it is a dream. The more accurate the map, the more it resembles the territory. The most accurate map possible would be the territory, and thus would be perfectly accurate and perfectly useless. The tale is the map that is the territory.}}

The development of electronic media blurs the line between map and territory by allowing for the [[simulation]] of ideas as encoded in electronic signals, as [[Baudrillard]] argues in ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'' (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;1):

{{quote|Today abstraction is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror, or the concept. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being or substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: A [[Hyperreality|hyperreal]]. The territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. It is nevertheless the map that precedes the territory—precession of simulacra—that engenders the territory.}}

The philosopher [[David Schmidtz]] draws on this distinction in his book ''Elements of Justice'', apparently deriving it from [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[private language argument]].

The fundamental trade-off between accuracy and usability of a map, particularly in the context of modelling, is known as [[Bonini's paradox]], and has been stated in various forms, poetically by [[Paul Valéry]]: "Everything simple is false. Everything which is complex is unusable."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8200">'''Masking''' is a process in which an individual changes or "masks" their natural personality to conform to social pressures, [[abuse]], and/or [[harassment]]. Some examples of masking are a single overly dominant [[temperament]], or [[The four humours|humor]], two incongruent temperaments, or displaying three of the four main temperaments within the same individual. Masking can be strongly influenced by environmental factors such as authoritarian parents, [[Social rejection|rejection]], and [[emotional abuse|emotional]], [[physical abuse|physical]], or [[sexual abuse|sexual]] abuse. An individual may not even know he or she is wearing a mask because it is a behavior that can take many forms.

[[File:P culture yellow.png|thumb|In theater, comedy and tragedy masks are used to help the actors portray their emotions similar to how people in society wear a mask to portray emotions that are acceptable]]

Masking should not be confused with masking behavior which is to mentally block feelings of suffering as a survival mechanism.

== History ==
The term masking was first used to describe the act of concealing disgust by 
[[Paul Ekman|Ekman]] (1972) and Friesen (1969).&lt;ref name=DeGere&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Gere|first=Dawn|title=The face of masking: Examining central tendencies and between-person variability in display management and display rule|journal=ProQuest Dissertations and Theses|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also thought of as a learned behavior. Developmental studies have shown that this ability has begun as early as preschool and improves with age.&lt;ref name=Cole&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cole|first=Pamela|title=Children's Spontaneous Control of Facial Expression|journal=Child Development|date=Dec 1986|volume=57|issue=6|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1986.tb00459.x|pages=1309–1321}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent developmental studies, masking has evolved and is now defined as concealing one's emotion by portraying another emotion. It is mostly used to conceal a negative emotion (usually sadness, frustration, and anger) with a positive emotion.&lt;ref name = DeGere /&gt;

== Causes ==
Contextual factors including relationships with one's conversation partner, status differences, location, and social setting are all reasons as to why an individual would express, suppress, or mask an emotion.&lt;ref name = DeGere /&gt; Masking is a facade to behave in certain ways that would help one hide their emotions and represses emotions that are not approved by those around them. Because a person wants to receive acceptance from the public, masking helps disguise characteristics like [[anger]], [[jealousy]] or [[Rage (emotion)|rage]] - emotions that would not be considered socially acceptable.&lt;ref name=Malchiodi&gt;{{cite web|last=Malchiodi|first=Cathy|title=The Healing Arts|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-healing-arts/201003/cool-art-therapy-intervention-8-mask-making|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=November 2017}}

=== Situations ===
* [[Personal space]]: Varies with individuals could be masking emotions to those close to them or strangers.
* Setting

=== Gender differences ===
Masking negative emotions differ for each gender. Females tend to have an easier time hiding their negative emotions towards something they dislike than males do.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=Teresa|title=Gender Differences in Masking Negative Emotions: Ability or Motivation?|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1995|volume=31|issue=4|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.31.4.660|pages=660–667}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the disputable reasons as to why females are able to mask their negative emotions better is [[Peer pressure|society's pressure]] that a girl must act nice.&lt;ref name=Davis /&gt;

=== Ethnicity ===
Masking also differs between cultures. Some studies state that certain cultures tend to moderate their expressions of emotion while others show a greater amount of positive emotions and expressions.&lt;ref name = DeGere /&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Each person masks their emotions differently. During one's childhood, an individual learns to behave a certain way when they receive approval from those around them and thus develops a mask. The individual is "not conscious of the role they've adopted and is projecting outwards to people they meet".&lt;ref name=Kundalini&gt;{{cite web|last=Kundalini|first=Betsy|title=Article: The Mask of the Personality|url=http://phoenixtools.org/articles/mask.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases where the individual is highly conscious, they may not know that they are wearing a mask. Wearing a mask takes away energy from our consciousness and, in the long run, wears out our energy.&lt;ref name = Kundalini /&gt; A person's mask is noticeable when he or she is sick or weak as the individual will no longer have the power to keep the mask on.

== Consequences ==
Little is known about the effects of masking one's negative emotions. In the workplace, masking leads to feelings of dissonance, insincerity, job dissatisfaction, emotional and physical exhaustion, and self-reported health problems.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Cynthia|author2=Neal Ashkanasy|title=The Emerging Role of Emotions in Work Life: An introduction|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|year=2000|doi=10.1002/(sici)1099-1379(200003)21:2&lt;123::aid-job33&gt;3.3.co;2-# |url=http://espace.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:139850/Fisher_Ashkanasy_2001.pdf|volume=21|pages=123–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have also reported experiencing [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatic symptoms]] and deleterious physiological and cognitive effects as a consequence.&lt;ref name = DeGere /&gt;

[[File:Madame Fortuna.png|thumb|A mask is usually used to conceal emotions]]

'''''Maya''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑː|j|ə}}; [[Devanagari]]: माया, [[IAST]]: ''māyā''), literally "illusion" or "magic",{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=535}}&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5kl0DYIjUPgC|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M|last=Lochtefeld|first=James G.|date=|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=9780823931798|location=|pages=433|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has multiple meanings in [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosophies]] depending on the context. In ancient Vedic literature, Māyā literally implies extraordinary power and wisdom.&lt;ref name=teun/&gt; In later [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] texts and modern literature dedicated to Indian traditions, Māyā connotes a "magic show, an illusion where things appear to be present but are not what they seem".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sb"/&gt; Māyā is also a spiritual concept connoting "that which exists, but is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal", and the "power or the principle that conceals the true character of spiritual reality".&lt;ref&gt;M Hiriyanna (2000), ''The Essentials of Indian Philosophy'', Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120813304}}, pp. 25, 160-161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lynnfoulston&gt;Lynn Foulston and Stuart Abbott (2009), ''Hindu Goddesses: Beliefs and Practices'', Sussex Academic Press, {{ISBN|978-1902210438}}, pp. 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and terminology==
''Māyā'' (Sanskrit: माया) is a word with unclear etymology, probably comes from the root ''mā''&lt;ref name=jangonda&gt;[[Jan Gonda]], ''Four studies in the language of the Veda'', Disputationes Rheno-Traiectinae (1959), pages 119-188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''[a]''' Tracy Pintchman (1994), The Rise of the Goddess in the Hindu Tradition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791421123}}, pages 3-4;&lt;br&gt;'''[b]''' Donald Braue (2006), Maya in Radhakrishnan's Thought: Six Meanings other than Illusion, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120822979}}, page 101, Quote: "Etymologically, the term ''māyā'' is derived from the Sanskrit verbal root mā (...) Whitney says the primary meaning of √mā is 'to measure'. L Thomas O'Neil agrees in his helpful exposition of the ways and contexts in which ''māyā'' is used in the Rigvedic tradition."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adriansnodgrass29&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Snodgrass |title=The Symbolism of the Stupa |authorlink=Adrian Snodgrass |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzqK8dDCM0UC |year=1992 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0781-5 |page=29 |quote='''Quote:''' The word ''māyā'' comes from the same root ''mā'', "to measure", as does ''mātra'', "measure", which in turn is etymologically linked to the Latin ''materia'', from which our word "matter" derives. ''Materia'' not only relates to ''mater'', "mother" and to ''matrix'', but also to ''metiri'', "to measure, to lay out (a place)", (...)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bangala Bhasar Abhidhaan (Dictionary of the Bengali Language) Shishu Sahitya Samsad Pvt Ltd. 32A, APC Road, Kolakata – 700009, Volume 2, p.1757 (ed. 1994)&lt;/ref&gt; which means "to measure".&lt;ref name=wmahonytau32/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Halbfass (1992), On Being and What There Is: Classical Vaisesika and the History of Indian Ontology, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791411780}}, page 42 footnote 40&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Monier Williams]], ''māyā'' meant "wisdom and extraordinary power" in an earlier older language, but from the Vedic period onwards, the word came to mean "illusion, unreality, deception, fraud, trick, sorcery, witchcraft and magic".&lt;ref name="sb"&gt;Bhattacharji, Sukumari (1970), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lDc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA35 The Indian Theogony: A Comparative Study of Indian Mythology from the Vedas to the Puraṇas], pages 35-37, Cambridge University Press Archive&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, P. D. Shastri states that the Monier Williams' list is a "loose definition, misleading generalization", and not accurate in interpreting ancient Vedic and medieval era Sanskrit texts; instead, he suggests a more accurate meaning of ''māyā'' is "appearance, not mere illusion".&lt;ref&gt;P. D. Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 5 and ix&lt;/ref&gt;

According to William Mahony, the root of the word may be ''man-'' or "to think", implying the role of imagination in the creation of the world. In early Vedic usage, the term implies, states Mahony, "the wondrous and mysterious  power to turn an idea into a physical reality".&lt;ref name=wmahonytau32&gt;William Mahony (1997), The Artful Universe: An Introduction to the Vedic Religious Imagination, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791435809}}, pages 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin Southworth states the word's origin is uncertain, and other possible roots of ''māyā'' include ''may-'' meaning mystify, confuse, intoxicate, delude, as well as ''māy-'' which means "disappear, be lost".&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Southworth (2012), Linguistic Archaeology of South Asia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415655446}}, page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jan Gonda]] considers the word related to ''mā'', which means "mother",&lt;ref name=jangonda/&gt; as do Tracy Pintchman&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Pintchman (1994), The Rise of the Goddess in the Hindu Tradition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791421123}}, page 30, '''Quote:''' "This material power is thereby readily linked to maternal creativity, a link made evident in the Sanskrit noun ''mā'', meaning both "mother" and "measure".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adrian Snodgrass]],&lt;ref name=adriansnodgrass29/&gt; serving as an epithet for goddesses such as [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref name=jangonda/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary Etymologically and Philologically Arranged, Oxford University Press, page 764 (Article on "मा"), Quote: 4. ''mā'', f. measure; (...) 4.2 ''mātā'', ''mātṛi'', a mother; (...) a measurer in Nirukta XI, (...) a maker, former, creator, arranger, preparer (Ved.); a knower, one who infers correctly or has true knowledge; (...) the maker (of the child in the womb, ''jā-mātṛi''); a mother (...) mother earth (Rigveda V.42.16); (...) epithet of Lakshmi, (...) epithet of Durga (...)&lt;/ref&gt; Maya here implies art, is the maker’s power, writes Zimmer, "a mother in all three worlds", a creatrix, her magic is the activity in the Will-spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Heinrich Robert Zimmer |title=Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization |year=2015|publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-1-4008-6684-7|pages=24–25|quote=Quote: Māyā is precisely the maker's power or art, “Magic” in Jacob Boehme's sense: “It is a mother in all three worlds, and makes each thing after the model of that thing's will, it is not the understanding, but it is a creatrix according to the understanding, and lends itself to good or to evil (...) In sum: Magic is the activity in the Will-spirit.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar word is also found in the [[Avesta]]n ''māyā'' with the meaning of "magic power".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Boyce (1996), A History of Zoroastrianism: The Early Period, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004104747}}, page 38-40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
====The Vedas====
Words related to and containing ''Māyā'', such as ''Mayava'', occur many times in the [[Vedas]]. These words have various meanings, with interpretations that are contested,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3ksBrWoZm0C|title=Vedic Civilization|last=Pruthi|first=Raj|date=|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|year=2004|isbn=9788171418756|location=|pages=222–223|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some are names of deities that do not appear in texts of 1st millennium BCE and later. The use of word Māyā in Rig veda, in the later era context of "magic, illusion, power", occurs in many hymns. One titled [[Mayabheda|Māyā-bheda]] (मायाभेद:, Discerning Illusion) includes hymns 10.177.1 through 10.177.3, as the battle unfolds between the good and the evil, as follows,&lt;ref name=lauriepatton/&gt;

The wise behold with their mind in their heart the Sun, made manifest by the illusion of the [[Asura]];
The sages look into the solar orb, the ordainers desire the region of his rays.
The Sun bears the word in his mind; the Gandharva has spoken it within the wombs; 
sages cherish it in the place of sacrifice, brilliant, heavenly, ruling the mind.
I beheld the protector, never descending, going by his paths to the east and the west;
clothing the quarters of the heaven and the intermediate spaces. He constantly revolves in the midst of the worlds.

The above Maya-bheda hymn discerns, using symbolic language, a contrast between mind influenced by light (sun) and magic (illusion of Asura). The hymn is a call to discern one's enemies, perceive artifice, and distinguish, using one's mind, between that which is perceived and that which is unperceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bringing the Gods to Mind:Mantra and Ritual in Early Indian Sacrifice|author=Laurie L. Patton|publisher=University of California Press|pages=137, 187|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rig veda does not connote the word Māyā as always good or always bad, it is simply a form of technique, mental power and means.&lt;ref name=beamsc&gt;Ben-Ami Scharfstein (1998), A Comparative History of World Philosophy: From the Upanishads to Kant, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791436844}}, page 376&lt;/ref&gt; Rig veda uses the word in two contexts, implying that there are two kinds of Māyā: divine Māyā and undivine Māyā, the former being the foundation of truth, the latter of falsehood.&lt;ref&gt;Sri Aurobindo (1917, Reprinted 1998), The Secret of the Veda, Volume 15, Sri Aurobindo Ashram Press, page 399, also see pages 225, 76, 89, 97, 512&lt;/ref&gt;

In hymns of 8.10.22, ''Virāj'' is used by Asuras (demons) who call her as Māyā, as follows,

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
She rose. The Asuras saw her. They called her. Their cry was, "Come, O Māyā, come thou hither" !!
Her cow was Virochana Prahradi. Her milking vessel was a pan of iron.
Dvimurdha Artvya milked this Māyā.
The Asuras depend for life on Māyā for their sustenance.
One who knows this, becomes a fit supporter [of gods].

====The Upanishads====
[[File:Waterfall.svg|thumb|[[M. C. Escher]] paintings such as the [[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]] – redrawn in this sketch – demonstrates the Hindu concept of Maya, states Jeffrey Brodd.&lt;ref&gt;J Brodd, World Religions: A Voyage of Discovery, 3rd Edition, Saint Mary's Press, {{ISBN|978-0884899976}}, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; The impression of water-world the sketch gives, in reality is not what it seems.]]
The [[Upanishads]] describe the universe, and the human experience, as an interplay of [[Purusha]] (the eternal, unchanging principles, consciousness) and [[Prakṛti]] (the temporary, changing material world, nature).&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], {{Google books|2h0YAAAAYAAJ|The Philosophy of the Upanishads|page=161}}, pages 161, 240-254&lt;/ref&gt; The former manifests itself as [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] (Soul, Self), and the latter as Māyā. The Upanishads refer to the knowledge of Atman as "true knowledge" (''Vidya''), and the knowledge of Maya as "not true knowledge" (''Avidya'', Nescience, lack of awareness, lack of true knowledge).&lt;ref name=beamsc/&gt; [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], states Ben-Ami Scharfstein, describes Maya as "the tendency to imagine something where it does not exist, for example, atman with the body".&lt;ref name=beamsc/&gt; To the Upanishads, knowledge includes empirical knowledge and spiritual knowledge, complete knowing necessarily includes understanding the hidden principles that work, the realization of the soul of things.

Hendrick Vroom explains, "The term ''Maya'' has been translated as 'illusion,' but then it does not concern normal illusion. Here 'illusion' does not mean that the world is not real and simply a figment of the human imagination. ''Maya'' means that the world is not as it seems; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned."&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Vroom (1996), No Other Gods, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0802840974}}, page 57&lt;/ref&gt; Lynn Foulston states, "The world is both real and unreal because it exists but is 'not what it appears to be'."&lt;ref name=lynnfoulston/&gt; According to Wendy Doniger, "to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1986), Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226618555}}, page 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Māyā pre-exists and co-exists with [[Brahman]] – the Ultimate Principle, Consciousness.&lt;ref name=aegough&gt;Archibald Edward Gough (2001), The Philosophy of the Upanishads and Ancient Indian Metaphysics, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415245227}}, pages 47-48&lt;/ref&gt; Maya is perceived reality, one that does not reveal the hidden principles, the true reality. Maya is unconscious, Atman is conscious. Maya is the literal, Brahman is the figurative ''Upādāna'' – the principle, the cause.&lt;ref name=aegough/&gt; Maya is born, changes, evolves, dies with time, from circumstances, due to invisible principles of nature, state the Upanishads. Atman-Brahman is eternal, unchanging, invisible principle, unaffected absolute and resplendent consciousness. Maya concept in the Upanishads, states Archibald Gough, is "the indifferent aggregate of all the possibilities of emanatory or derived existences, pre-existing with Brahman", just like the possibility of a future tree pre-exists in the seed of the tree.&lt;ref name=aegough/&gt;

The concept of Maya appears in numerous Upanishads. The verses 4.9 to 4.10 of [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]], is the oldest explicit occurrence of the idea that Brahman (Supreme Soul) is the hidden reality, nature is magic, Brahman is the magician, human beings are infatuated with the magic and thus they create bondage to illusions and delusions, and for freedom and liberation one must seek true insights and correct knowledge of the principles behind the hidden magic.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 316-317&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudapada in his Karika on [[Mandukya Upanishad]] explains the interplay of Atman and Maya as follows,&lt;ref name=pauldvol2&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814691}}, page 618&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
The Soul is imagined first, then the particularity of objects,
External and internal, as one knows so one remembers.
As a rope, not perceived distinctly in dark, is erroneously imagined,
As snake, as a streak of water, so is the Soul (Atman) erroneously imagined.
As when the rope is distinctly perceived, and the erroneous imagination withdrawn,
Only the rope remains, without a second, so when distinctly perceived, the Atman.
When he as Pranas (living beings), as all the diverse objects appears to us,
Then it is all mere Maya, with which the Brahman (Supreme Soul) deceives himself.

Sarvasara Upanishad refers to two concepts: ''Mithya'' and ''Maya''.&lt;ref name=knaiyar/&gt; It defines ''Mithya'' as illusion and calls it one of three kinds of substances, along with Sat (Be-ness, True) and Asat (not-Be-ness, False).  ''Maya'', Sarvasara Upanishad defines as all what is not Atman. Maya has no beginning, but has an end. Maya, declares Sarvasara, is anything that can be studied and subjected to proof and disproof, anything with [[Guṇa]]s.&lt;ref name=knaiyar/&gt; In the human search for Self-knowledge, Maya is that which obscures, confuses and distracts an individual.&lt;ref name=knaiyar&gt;KN Aiyar (Translator, 1914), Sarvasara Upanishad, in Thirty Minor Upanishads, page 17, {{oclc|6347863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Puranas and Tamil texts====
[[File:Kamchipuram 4015.jpg|thumb|Markandeya sees Vishnu as an infant on a fig leaf in the deluge.]]

In [[Puranas]] and Vaishnava theology, ''māyā'' is described as one of the nine shaktis of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name="sb1"&gt;Bhattacharji, Sukumari (1970). The Indian Theogony: A Comparative Study of Indian Mythology from the Vedas to the Puraṇas, p.312-345. CUP Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Māyā'' became associated with sleep; and Vishnu's ''māyā'' is sleep which envelopes the world when he awakes to destroy evil. Vishnu, like Indra, is the master of ''māyā''; and ''māyā'' envelopes Vishnu's body.&lt;ref name="sb1"/&gt; The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' narrates that the sage [[Markandeya]] requests Vishnu to experience his ''māyā''. Vishnu appears as an infant floating on a fig leaf in a deluge and then swallows the sage, the sole survivor of the cosmic flood. The sage sees various worlds of the universe, gods etc. and his own hermitage in the infant's belly. Then the infant breathes out the sage, who tries to embrace the infant, but everything disappears and the sage realizes that he was in his hermitage the whole time and was given a flavor of Vishnu's ''māyā''.&lt;ref name="Brown1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cheever Mackenzie Brown|title=The Triumph of the Goddess: The Canonical Models and Theological Visions of the Devi-Bhagavata Purana|year=1990|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0363-1|chapter=The two Bhagavatas|pages=27–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magic creative power, ''Māyā'' was always a monopoly of the central Solar God; and was also associated with the early solar prototype of Vishnu in the early Aditya phase.&lt;ref name="sb1"/&gt;

Maya, to Shaiva Siddhanta sub-school of Hinduism, states Hilko Schomerus, is reality and truly existent, and one that exists to "provide Souls with ''Bhuvana'' (a world), ''Bhoga'' (objects of enjoyment), ''Tanu'' (a body) and ''Karana'' (organs)".&lt;ref&gt;Hilko Schomerus (2000), Śaiva Siddhānta: An Indian School of Mystical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120815698}}, page 118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools of Hinduism===
====Need to understand Māyā====
The various schools of Hinduism, particularly those based on naturalism ([[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]]), rationalism ([[Samkhya]]) or ritualism ([[Mimamsa]]), questioned and debated what is Maya, and the need to understand Maya.&lt;ref name=adishankarabr&gt;Adi Shankara (Translator: S Vireswarananda), Commentary on Brahma-sutras, Advaita Ashrama, pages 30-37, [https://archive.org/stream/BrahmaSutraBhashyaByAdiShankaracharyasanskrit.pdf/Brahma.Sutra.Bhashya.By.Adi.Shankaracharya.Sanskrit#page/n1/mode/2up Archive in Sanskrit], [http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Brahma%20Sutras%20-%20According%20to%20Sri%20Sankara%20by%20Swami%20Vireswarananda%20&amp;#91;Sanskrit-English&amp;#93;.pdf Translated in English]&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedanta and Yoga schools explained that complete realization of knowledge requires both the understanding of ignorance, doubts and errors, as well as the understanding of invisible principles, incorporeal and the eternal truths. In matters of Self-knowledge, stated Shankara in his commentary on [[Taittiriya Upanishad]],&lt;ref name=adishankaratu/&gt; one is faced with the question, "Who is it that is trying to know, and how does he attain Brahman?" It is absurd, states Shankara, to speak of one becoming himself; because "Thou Art That" already. Realizing and removing ignorance is a necessary step, and this can only come from understanding Maya and then looking beyond it.&lt;ref name=adishankaratu&gt;Adi Shankara, {{Google books|d0oAAAAYAAJ|Commentary on Taittiriya Upanishad}}, SS Sastri (Translator), Harvard University Archives, pages 191-198&lt;/ref&gt;

The need to understand Maya is like the metaphorical need for road. Only when the country to be reached is distant, states Shankara, that a road must be pointed out. It is a meaningless contradiction to assert, "I am right now in my village, but I need a road to reach my village."&lt;ref name=adishankaratu/&gt; It is the confusion, ignorance and illusions that need to be repealed. It is only when the knower sees nothing else but his Self that he can be fearless and permanent.&lt;ref name=adishankarabr/&gt;&lt;ref name=adishankaratu/&gt; Vivekananda explains the need to understand Maya as follows (abridged),&lt;ref name=vivekananda7&gt;S Vivekananda, {{Google books|UAONAwAAQBAJ|The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda}}, Volume 7, pages 63-65&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
The Vedas cannot show you Brahman, you are That already. They can only help to take away the veil that hides truth from our eyes. The cessation of ignorance can only come when I know that God and I are one; in other words, identify yourself with Atman, not with human limitations. The idea that we are bound is only an illusion [Maya]. Freedom is inseparable from the nature of the Atman. This is ever pure, ever perfect, ever unchangeable.
|[[Adi Shankara]]'s commentary on Fourth Vyasa Sutra, [[Swami Vivekananda]] &lt;ref name=vivekananda7/&gt;}}

The text [[Yoga Vasistha]] explains the need to understand Maya as follows,&lt;ref name=sven/&gt;

{{quote|
Just as when the dirt is removed, the real substance is made manifest; just as when the darkness of the night is dispelled, the objects that were shrouded by the darkness are clearly seen, when ignorance [Maya] is dispelled, truth is realized.

====Samkhya school====
The early works of Samkhya, the rationalist school of Hinduism, do not identify or directly mention the Maya doctrine.&lt;ref name="nakamura"&gt;Nakamura, Hajime (1990). A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy, p.335-336. Motilal Banarsidass Publications. {{ISBN|9788120806511}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion of Maya theory, calling it into question, appears after the theory gains ground in Vedanta school of Hinduism. [[Vācaspati Miśra]]'s commentary on the ''Samkhyakarika'', for example, questions the Maya doctrine saying "It is not possible to say that the notion of the phenomenal world being real is false, for there is no evidence to contradict it".&lt;ref name="nakamura"/&gt; Samkhya school steadfastly retained its duality concept of Prakrti and Purusha, both real and distinct, with some texts equating Prakrti to be Maya that is "not illusion, but real", with three [[Guṇa]]s in different proportions whose changing state of equilibrium defines the perceived reality.&lt;ref&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, pages 4 and 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James R. Ballantyne|James Ballantyne]], in 1885, commented on Kapila's Sánkhya aphorism 5.72{{refn|group=note|प्रकृतिपुरुष योरन्यत्सर्वमनित्यम् ॥७२॥}} which he translated as, "everything except nature and soul is uneternal". According to Ballantyne, this aphorism states that the mind, ether, etc. in a state of cause (not developed into a product) are called Nature and not Intellect. He adds, that scriptural texts such as [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] to be stating "He should know Illusion to be Nature and him in whom is Illusion to be the great Lord and the world to be pervaded by portions of him'; since Soul and Nature are also made up of parts, they must be uneternal".&lt;ref name=ballantyne373&gt;Ballantyne, James Robert (1885), The Sánkhya Aphorisms of Kapila, pp. 373-374 with footnote 6, Trubner's Oriental Series, Reprinted by Routledge (2000), {{ISBN|0415245141}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, acknowledges Ballantyne,&lt;ref name=ballantyne373/&gt; Edward Gough translates the same verse in [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] differently, 'Let the sage know that Prakriti is Maya and that Mahesvara is the Mayin, or arch-illusionist. All this shifting world is filled with portions of him'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/philosophyoftheu004284mbp#page/n241/mode/2up The Philosophy of the Upanishads and Ancient Indian Metaphysics] Edward Gough, page 224&lt;/ref&gt; In continuation of the Samkhya and Upanishadic view, in the Bhagavata philosophy, Maya has been described as 'that which appears even when there is no object like silver in a shell and which does not appear in the atman'; with maya described as the power that creates, maintains and destroys the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Vyas,Ramnarayan.(1974). The Synthetic Philosophy of the Bhāgavata, p.101. Meharchand Lachhmandas.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nyaya school====
The realism-driven Nyaya school of Hinduism denied that either the world (Prakrti) or the soul (Purusa) are an illusion. Naiyayikas developed theories of illusion, typically using the term ''Mithya'', and stated that illusion is simply flawed cognition, incomplete cognition or the absence of cognition.&lt;ref name= stephenphillipsnyaya/&gt; There is no deception in the reality of Prakrti or ''[[Pradhana]]'' (creative principle of matter/nature) or Purusa, only confusion or lack of comprehension or lack of cognitive effort, according to Nyaya scholars. To them, illusion has a cause, that rules of reason and proper ''[[Pramanas]]'' (epistemology) can uncover.&lt;ref name= stephenphillipsnyaya/&gt;

Illusion, stated Naiyayikas, involves the projection into current cognition of predicated content from memory (a form of rushing to interpret, judge, conclude). This "projection illusion" is misplaced, and stereotypes something to be what it is not.&lt;ref name=stephenphillipsnyaya&gt;Stephen H Phillips (2012), Epistemology in Classical India: The Knowledge Sources of the Nyaya School, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1138008816}}, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; The insights on theory of illusion by Nyaya scholars were later adopted and applied by Advaita Vedanta scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Bina Gupta (1995), Perceiving in Advaita Vedānta: Epistemological Analysis and Interpretation, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812963}}, pages 29-38, 117-132&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yoga school====
Maya in Yoga school is the manifested world and implies divine force.&lt;ref name=teun66&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, page 66&lt;/ref&gt; Yoga and Maya are two sides of the same coin, states Zimmer, because what is referred to as Maya by living beings who are enveloped by it, is Yoga for the Brahman (Universal Principle, Supreme Soul) whose yogic perfection creates the Maya.&lt;ref&gt;HR Zimmer (1978), Maya: der indische Mythos, Insel-Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3458058816}}, page 62 (German), {{oclc|760396118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maya is neither illusion nor denial of perceived reality to the Yoga scholars, rather Yoga is a means to perfect the "creative discipline of mind" and "body-mind force" to transform Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, pages 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Yoga as power to create Maya has been adopted as a compound word ''Yogamaya'' (योगमाया) by the theistic sub-schools of Hinduism. It occurs in various mythologies of the Puranas; for example, Shiva uses his ''yogamāyā'' to transform Markendeya's heart in [[Bhagavata Purana]]'s chapter 12.10, while Krishna counsels Arjuna about ''yogamāyā'' in hymn 7.25 of [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref name=teun66/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/भगवद्गीता/ज्ञानविज्ञानयोगः भगवद्गीता/ज्ञानविज्ञानयोगः], Bhagavad Gita 7.25, Wikisource (Sanskrit)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vedanta school====
Maya is a prominent and commonly referred to concept in Vedanta philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;PD Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Radhakrishnan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2376777 The Vedanta Philosophy and the Doctrine of Maya], International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 24, No. 4 (Jul., 1914), pages 431-451&lt;/ref&gt; Maya is often translated as "illusion", in the sense of "appearance".&lt;ref&gt;Donald Braue (2006), Maya in Radhakrishnan's Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120822979}}, pages 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P. Schultz (1979), Judaism and the Gentile Faiths: Comparative Studies in Religion, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, {{ISBN|978-0838617076}}, page 93&lt;/ref&gt; Human mind constructs a subjective experience, states Vedanta school, which leads to the peril of misunderstanding Maya as well as interpreting Maya as the only and final reality. Vedantins assert the "perceived world including people are not what they appear to be".&lt;ref&gt;HM Vroom (1989), Religions and the Truth: Philosophical Reflections and Perspectives, Eerdmans Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0802805027}}, pages 122-123&lt;/ref&gt; There are invisible principles and laws at work, true invisible nature in others and objects, and invisible soul that one never perceives directly, but this invisible reality of Self and Soul exists, assert Vedanta scholars. Māyā is that which manifests, perpetuates a sense of false [[dualism (Indian philosophy)|duality]] (or divisional plurality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brodd | first = Jefferey | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = World Religions | publisher = Saint Mary's Press | year = 2003 | location = Winona, MN | pages = | url = | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-88489-725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This manifestation is real, but it obfuscates and eludes the hidden principles and true nature of reality. Vedanta school holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of these invisible principles – the Self, that the Self (Soul) in oneself is same as the Self in another and the Self in everything (Brahman).&lt;ref&gt;PD Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 58-73&lt;/ref&gt; The difference within various sub-schools of Vedanta is the relationship between individual soul and cosmic soul (Brahman). Non-theistic Advaita sub-school holds that both are One, everyone is thus deeply connected Oneness, there is God in everyone and everything;&lt;ref&gt;A Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791468524}}, pages 47, 99-103&lt;/ref&gt; while theistic Dvaita and other sub-schools hold that individual souls and God's soul are distinct and each person can at best love God constantly to get one's soul infinitely close to His Soul.&lt;ref&gt;James Lewis and William Travis (1999), Religious Traditions of the World, {{ISBN|978-1579102302}}, pages 279-280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|978-3110342550}}, pages 155-157&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advaita Vedanta'''

In [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy, there are two realities: ''Vyavaharika'' (empirical reality) and ''Paramarthika'' (absolute, spiritual reality).&lt;ref name=fredfost&gt;Frederic F. Fost (1998), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400333 Playful Illusion: The Making of Worlds in Advaita Vedānta], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul., 1998), pages 387-405&lt;/ref&gt; Māyā is the empirical reality that entangles consciousness. Māyā has the power to create a bondage to the empirical world, preventing the unveiling of the true, unitary Self—the Cosmic Spirit also known as [[Brahman]]. The theory of māyā was developed by the ninth-century Advaita Hindu philosopher [[Adi Shankara]]. However, competing theistic Dvaita scholars contested Shankara's theory,&lt;ref&gt;Surendranath Dasgupta, ''A History of Indian Philosophy.'' Cambridge University Press Archive, 1955, page 1. "He [Bhaskara] speaks in very strong terms against the commentator [Shankara] who holds the ''māyā'' doctrine and is a Buddhist in his views. But, though he was opposed to Shankara, it was only so far as Shankara had introduced the ''māyā'' doctrine, and only so far as he thought the world had sprung forth not as a real modification of Brahman, but only through ''māyā''."&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that Shankara did not offer a theory of the relationship between Brahman and Māyā.&lt;ref&gt;Pratima Bowes, "Mysticism in the Upanishads and Shankara's Vedanta" in Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic." Routledge, 1995, page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; A later Advaita scholar Prakasatman addressed this, by explaining, "Maya and Brahman together constitute the entire universe, just like two kinds of interwoven threads create a fabric. Maya is the manifestation of the world, whereas Brahman, which supports Maya, is the cause of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Esther Abraham Solomon (1969), Avidyā: A Problem of Truth and Reality, {{oclc|658823}}, pages 269-270&lt;/ref&gt;

Māyā is a fact in that it is the appearance of phenomena. Since Brahman is the sole metaphysical truth, Māyā is true in epistemological and empirical sense; however, Māyā is not the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is empirical truth is only true for now. Since Māyā is the perceived material world, it is true in perception context, but is "untrue" in spiritual context of Brahman. Māyā is not false, it only clouds the inner Self and principles that are real. True Reality includes both ''Vyavaharika'' (empirical) and ''Paramarthika'' (spiritual), the Māyā and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize Brahman, realize the fearless, resplendent Oneness.&lt;ref name=fredfost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Vedānta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820272}}, pages 19-40, 53-58, 79-86&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivekananda said: "When the Hindu says the world is Maya, at once people get the idea that the world is an illusion. This interpretation has some basis, as coming through the Buddhistic philosophers, because there was one section of philosophers who did not believe in the external world at all. But the Maya of the Vedanta, in its last developed form, is neither Idealism nor Realism, nor is it a theory. It is a simple statement of facts — what we are and what we see around us."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_2/jnana-yoga/maya_and_illusion.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Early Buddhist Texts]] contain some references to illusion, the most well known of which is the ''Pheṇapiṇḍūpama Sutta'' in Pali (and with a Chinese Agama parallel at SĀ 265) which states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose, monks, that a magician (māyākāro) or a magician’s apprentice (māyākārantevāsī) would display a magical illusion (māyaṃ) at a crossroads. A man with good sight would inspect it, ponder, and carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void (rittaka), hollow (tucchaka), coreless (asāraka). For what core (sāro) could there be in a magical illusion (māyāya)? So too, monks, whatever kind of cognition there is, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: a monk inspects it, ponders it, and carefully investigates it, and it would appear to him to be void (rittaka), hollow (tucchaka), coreless (asāraka). For what core (sāro) could there be in cognition?&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One sutra in the Āgama collection known as "Mahāsūtras" of the (Mūla)Sarvāstivādin tradition entitled the ''Māyājāla'' (Net of Illusion) deals especially with the theme of Maya. This sutra only survives in Tibetan translation and compares the five aggregates with further metaphors for illusion, including: an echo, a reflection in a mirror, a mirage, sense pleasures in a dream and a madman wandering naked.&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

These texts give the impression that māyā refers to the insubstantial and essence-less nature of things as well as their deceptive, false and vain character.&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later texts such as the [[Lalitavistara]] also contain references to illusion:

:"Complexes have no inner might, are empty in themselves; Rather like the stem of the plantain tree, when one reflects on them, Like an illusion (māyopama) which deludes the mind (citta), Like an empty fist with which a child is teased."&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Salistamba Sutra]] also puts much emphasis on illusion, describing all dharmas as being “characterized as illusory” and “vain, hollow, without core”. Likewise the Mahāvastu, a highly influential Mahāsāṃghikan text on the life of the Buddha, states that the Buddha “has shown that the aggregates are like a lightning flash, as a bubble, or as the white foam on a wave.”&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theravada===
In [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] 'Māyā' is the name of the mother of the Buddha as well as a metaphor for the consciousness aggregate (''viññana''). The Theravada monk Bhikkhu Bodhi considers the Pali ''Pheṇapiṇḍūpama Sutta'' “one of the most radical discourses on the empty nature of conditioned phenomena.”&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Bodhi also cites the Pali commentary on this sutra, the ''Sāratthappakāsinī'' (Spk), which states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cognition is like a magical illusion (māyā) in the sense that it is insubstantial and cannot be grasped. Cognition is even more transient and fleeting than a magical illusion. For it gives the impression that a person comes and goes, stands and sits, with the same mind, but the mind is different in each of these activities. Cognition deceives the multitude like a magical illusion (māyā).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Connected Discourses of the Buddha Vol I p. 1087, n. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Likewise, Bhikkhu [[Katukurunde Nyanananda Thera]] has written an exposition of the ''Kàlakàràma Sutta'' which features the image of a magical illusion as its central metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Katukurunde Nyanananda Thera. The Magic of the Mind (PDF), Buddhist Publication Society, 1974, OCLC 2999880&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarvastivada===
The ''Nyānānusāra Śāstra'', a Vaibhāṣika response to [[Vasubandhu]]’s [[Abhidharmakosha]] cites the ''Māyājāla sutra'' and explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Seeing an illusory object (māyā)”: Although what one apprehends is unreal, nothing more than an illusory sign. If one does not admit this much, then an illusory sign should be non-existent. What is an illusory sign? It is the result of illusion magic. Just as one with higher gnosis can magically create forms, likewise this illusory sign does actually have manifestation and shape. Being produced by illusion magic, it acts as the object of vision. That object which is taken as really existent is in fact ultimately non-existent. Therefore, this [Māyājāla] Sūtra states that it is non-existent, due to the illusory object there is a sign but not substantiality. Being able to beguile and deceive one, it is known as a “deceiver of the eye.”&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mahayana===
In [[Mahayana sutras]], illusion is an important theme of the [[Prajñāpāramitā]] sutras. Here, the magician's illusion exemplifies how people misunderstand and misperceive reality, which is in fact empty of any essence and cannot be grasped. The Mahayana uses similar metaphors for illusion: magic, a dream, a bubble, a rainbow, lightning, the moon reflected in water, a mirage, and a city of celestial musicians." &lt;ref&gt;Thinley Norbe Rinpoche in The Dzogchen Primer, Marcia Binder Schmidt ed. Shambala, Boston, 2002, pg. 215 {{ISBN|1-57062-829-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding that what we experience is less substantial than we believe is intended to serve the purpose of liberation from ignorance, fear, and clinging and the attainment of enlightenment as a Buddha completely dedicated to the welfare of all beings. The Prajñaparamita texts also state that all dharmas (phenomena) are like an illusion, not just the [[five aggregates]], but all beings, including [[Bodhisattva]]s and even [[Nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prajñaparamita-ratnaguna-samcayagatha'' (Rgs) states:

:This gnosis shows him all beings as like an illusion, Resembling a great crowd of people, conjured up at the crossroads, By a magician, who then cuts off many thousands of heads; He knows this whole living world as a magical creation, and yet remains without fear. ''Rgs'' 1:19 
And also:
:Those who teach Dharma, and those who listen when it is being taught; Those who have won the fruition of a Worthy One, a Solitary Buddha, or a World Savior; And the nirvāṇa obtained by the wise and learned— All is born of illusion—so has the Tathāgata declared. - ''Rgs'' 2:5 &lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ven. Dr. Huifeng, what this means is that Bodhisattvas see through all conceptualizations and conceptions, for they are deceptive and illusory, and sever or cut off all these cognitive creations.&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

Depending on the stage of the practitioner, the magical illusion is experienced differently. In the ordinary state, we get attached to our own mental phenomena, believing they are real, like the audience at a magic show gets attached to the illusion of a beautiful lady. At the next level, called actual relative truth, the beautiful lady appears, but the magician does not get attached.  Lastly, at the ultimate level, the Buddha is not affected one way or the other by the illusion. Beyond conceptuality, the Buddha is neither attached nor non-attached.&lt;ref&gt;Thinley Norbe Rinpoche in The Dzogchen Primer, Marcia Binder Schmidt ed. Shambala, Boston, 2002, pg. 217 {{ISBN|1-57062-829-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the middle way of Buddhism, which explicitly refutes the extremes of both eternalism and [[nihilism]].

[[Nāgārjuna]]'s [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy discusses ''nirmita'', or illusion closely related to māyā.  In this example, the illusion is a self-awareness that is, like the magical illusion, mistaken. For Nagarjuna, the self is not the organizing command center of experience, as we might think.  Actually, it is just one element combined with other factors and strung together in a sequence of causally connected moments in time. As such, the self is not substantially real, but neither can it be shown to be unreal. The continuum of moments, which we mistakenly understand to be a solid, unchanging self, still performs actions and undergoes their results. "As a magician creates a magical illusion by the force of magic, and the illusion produces another illusion, in the same way the agent is a magical illusion and the action done is the illusion created by another illusion."&lt;ref&gt;Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakarika Prajna Nama, J.W. DeJong, Christian Lindtner (eds.) quoted in Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Jan Westerhoff, Oxford University Press, New York, 2009. p. 163 {{ISBN|978-0-19-537521-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; What we experience may be an illusion, but we are living inside the illusion and bear the fruits of our actions there. We undergo the experiences of the illusion. What we do affects what we experience, so it matters.&lt;ref&gt;Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Jan Westerhoff, Oxford University Press, New York, 2009. p. 164 {{ISBN|978-0-19-537521-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, Nagarjuna uses the magician's illusion to show that the self is not as real as it thinks, yet, to the extent it is inside the illusion, real enough to warrant respecting the ways of the world.

For the Mahayana Buddhist, the self is māyā like a magic show and so are objects in the world. Vasubandhu's ''Trisvabhavanirdesa'', a Mahayana [[Yogacara]] "Mind Only" text, discusses the example of the magician who makes a piece of wood appear as an elephant.&lt;ref name="autogenerated61"&gt;The Emptiness of Emptiness: An Introduction to Early Indian Madhyamika.  C.W. Huntingdon, Jr. with Geshe Namgyal Wangchen, University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, 1989, {{ISBN|0-8248-1165-8}}, p.61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The audience is looking at a piece of wood but, under the spell of magic, perceives an elephant instead.  Instead of believing in the reality of the illusory elephant, we are invited to recognize that multiple factors are involved in creating that perception, including our involvement in dualistic subjectivity, causes and conditions, and the ultimate beyond duality. Recognizing how these factors combine to create what we perceive ordinarily, ultimate reality appears. Perceiving that the elephant is illusory is akin to seeing through the magical illusion, which reveals the [[dharmadhatu]], or ground of being.&lt;ref name="autogenerated61"/&gt;

===Tantra===
Buddhist [[Tantra]], a further development of the Mahayana, also makes use of the magician's illusion example in yet another way. In the completion stage of Buddhist Tantra, the practitioner takes on the form of a deity in an illusory body (māyādeha), which is like the magician's illusion. It is made of wind, or [[prana]], and is called illusory because it appears only to other [[yogis]] who have also attained the illusory body. The illusory body has the markings and signs of a Buddha. There is an impure and a pure illusory body, depending on the stage of the yogi's practice.&lt;ref&gt;Highest Yoga Tantra: An Introduction to the Esoteric Buddhism of Tibet, Daniel Cozort, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY 1986, pgs. 94-95.  {{ISBN|0-937938-32-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept that the world is an illusion is controversial in Buddhism. The Buddha does not state that the world is an illusion, but ''like'' an illusion. In the [[Dzogchen]] tradition the ''perceived reality'' is considered literally unreal, in that objects which make-up perceived reality are known as objects within one's mind, and that, ''as we conceive them'', there is no pre-determined object, or assembly of objects in isolation from experience that may be considered the "true" object, or objects. As a prominent contemporary teacher puts it: "In a real sense, all the visions that we see in our lifetime are like a big dream [...]".&lt;ref name="ChNN_dream_yoga_book"&gt;[[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] ''Dream Yoga And The Practice Of Natural Light'' Edited and introduced by Michael Katz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, {{ISBN|1-55939-007-7}}, pp. 42, 46, 48, 96, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term ''visions'' denotes not only visual perceptions, but appearances perceived through all senses, including sounds, smells, tastes and tactile sensations.

Different schools and traditions in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] give different explanations of the mechanism producing the illusion usually called "reality".&lt;ref&gt;Elías Capriles.

==Jainism==
[[File:Jain Prateek Chihna.svg|thumb|120px|Jainism]]
''Maya'', in Jainism, means appearances or deceit that prevents one from ''Samyaktva'' (right belief). Maya is one of three causes of failure to reach right belief. The other two are ''Mithyatva'' (false belief)&lt;ref&gt;JL Jaini (Editor: FW Thomas), Outlines of Jainism, Jain Literature Society, Cambridge University Press Archive, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Nidana'' (hankering after fame and worldly pleasures).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, page 50&lt;/ref&gt;

''Maya'' is a closely related concept to ''Mithyatva'', with Maya a source of wrong information while Mithyatva an individual's attitude to knowledge, with relational overlap.

[[Śvētāmbara|Svetambara]] Jains classify categories of false belief under ''Mithyatva'' into five: ''Abhigrahika'' (false belief that is limited to one's own scriptures that one can defend, but refusing to study and analyze other scriptures); ''Anabhigrahika'' (false belief that equal respect must be shown to all gods, teachers, scriptures); ''Abhiniviseka'' (false belief resulting from pre-conceptions with a lack of discernment and refusal to do so); ''Samsayika'' (state of hesitation or uncertainty between various conflicting, inconsistent beliefs); and ''Anabhogika'' (innate, default false beliefs that a person has not thought through on one's own).&lt;ref name=robertwilliams48&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, pages 47-49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digambara]] Jains classify categories of false belief under ''Mithyatva'' into seven: ''Ekantika'' (absolute, one sided false belief), ''Samsayika'' (uncertainty, doubt whether a course is right or wrong, unsettled belief, skepticism), ''Vainayika'' (false belief that all gods, gurus and scriptures are alike, without critical examination), ''Grhita'' (false belief derived purely from habits or default, no self-analysis), ''Viparita'' (false belief that true is false, false is true, everything is relative or acceptable), ''Naisargika'' (false belief that all living beings are devoid of consciousness and cannot discern right from wrong), ''Mudha-drsti'' (false belief that violence and anger can tarnish or damage thoughts, divine, guru or [[dharma]]).&lt;ref name=robertwilliams48/&gt;

''Māyā'' (deceit) is also considered as one of four ''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|Kaṣaya]]'' (faulty passion, a trigger for actions) in Jain philosophy. The other three are ''Krodha'' (anger), ''Māna'' (pride) and ''Lobha'' (greed).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Jain texts recommend that one must subdue these four faults, as they are source of bondage, attachment and non-spiritual passions.&lt;ref&gt;P Jaini (1998), The Jaina Path of Purification, Motilal Banarsidass. {{ISBN|81-20815785}}, pages 119-122&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
When he wishes that which is good for him, he should get rid of the four faults — Krodha, Māna, Māyā and Lobha — which increase evil. Anger and pride when not suppressed, and deceit and greed when arising: all these four black passions water the roots of re-birth.

==Sikhism==
[[File:Khanda Orange.jpg|thumb|120px|Sikhism]]
In [[Sikhism]], the [[world]] is regarded as both transitory and relatively [[reality|real]].&lt;ref name="Kohli"&gt;Surinder Singh Kohli, ''Guru Granth Sahib: An Analytical Study.'' Singh Brothers, Amritsar, 1992, page 262.&lt;/ref&gt; [[God in Sikhism|God]] is viewed as the only reality, but within God exist both [[conscious]] [[souls]] and [[Consciousness|nonconscious]] objects; these created objects are also real.&lt;ref name="Kohli" /&gt; [[Natural]] [[phenomena]] are real but the effects they generate are unreal. māyā is as the events are real yet māyā is not as the effects are unreal. Sikhism believes that people are trapped in the world because of five vices: lust, anger, greed, attachment, and ego. Maya enables these five vices and makes a person think the physical world is "real," whereas, the goal of Sikhism is to rid the self of them. Consider the following example: In the moonless night, a [[rope]] lying on the ground may be mistaken for a [[snake]]. We know that the rope alone is real, not the snake. However, the failure to perceive the rope gives rise to the false [[perception]] of the snake. Once the darkness is removed, the rope alone remains; the snake disappears.

* ''Sakti adher jevarhee bhram chookaa nihchal siv ghari vaasaa.''&lt;br /&gt;In the darkness of māyā, I mistook the rope for the snake, but that is over, and now I dwell in the eternal home of the Lord.&lt;br /&gt;(Sri Guru Granth Sahib 332).
* ''Raaj bhuiang prasang jaise hahi ab kashu maram janaaiaa.''&lt;br /&gt;Like the story of the rope mistaken for a snake, the mystery has now been explained to me. Like the many bracelets, which I mistakenly thought were gold; now, I do not say what I said then. (Sri Guru Granth Sahib 658).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurbani.org/articles/webart14.htm Deceptive māyā]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[mythologies]] the [[symbol]] of the snake was associated with [[money]], and māyā in modern [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] refers to money. However, in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] māyā refers to the "grand illusion" of [[materialism]]. From this māyā all other [[evil]]s are born, but by understanding the nature of māyā a [[person]] begins to approach [[spirituality]].

* ''Janam baritha jāṯ rang mā▫i▫ā kai. ||1|| rahā▫o.''&lt;br /&gt;You are squandering this life uselessly in the love of māyā.&lt;br /&gt;Sri Guru Granth Sahib M.5 Guru Arjan Dev ANG 12

The teachings of the [[Sikh Guru]]s push the idea of [[Selfless service|sewa]] (selfless service) and [[simran]] ([[prayer]], [[meditation]], or remembering one's true [[death]]). The depths of these two [[concept]]s and the core of [[Sikhism]] comes from [[sangat (term)|sangat]] (congregation): by joining the congregation of true [[saints]] one is [[salvation|saved]]. By contrast, most people are believed to suffer from the [[false consciousness]] of materialism, as described in the following extracts from the Guru Granth Sahib:

* ''Mā▫i▫ā mohi visāri▫ā jagaṯ piṯā parṯipāl.''&lt;br /&gt;In attachment to māyā, they have forgotten the Father, the Cherisher of the World.&lt;br /&gt;Sri Guru Granth Sahib M3 Guru Amar Das  ANG 30
* ''Ih sarīr mā▫i▫ā kā puṯlā vicẖ ha▫umai ḏustī pā▫ī.''&lt;br /&gt;This body is the [[puppet]] of māyā. The evil of [[egotism]] is within it.&lt;br /&gt;Sri Guru Granth Sahib M3 Guru Amar Das
* ''Bābā mā▫i▫ā bẖaram bẖulā▫e.''&lt;br /&gt;O Baba, māyā deceives with its illusion.&lt;br /&gt;Sri Guru Granth Sahib M1 Guru Nanak Dev ANG 60
* "For that which we cannot see, feel, smell, touch, or understand, we do not believe. For this, we are merely fools walking on the grounds of great potential with no comprehension of what is."&lt;br /&gt;[[Buddhist]] [[monk]] quotation&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=māyā+site:srigranth.org&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1T4ADBF_en-GBGB267GB268&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N extracts on māyā from Guru Granth Sahib]&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{CO2|link=yes}} + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → [[Methane|CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

:CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

During anaerobic respiration of carbohydrates, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and acetate are formed in a ratio of 2:1 or lower, so H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contributes only ca. 33% to methanogenesis, with acetate contributing the greater proportion. In some circumstances, for instance in the [[rumen]], where acetate is largely absorbed into the bloodstream of the host, the contribution of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to methanogenesis is greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conrad|first=Rolf|date=1999|title=Contribution of hydrogen to methane production and control of hydrogen concentrations in methanogenic soils and sediments|url=http://femsec.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/3/193.abstract|journal=FEMS Microbiology Ecology|volume=28|pages=193–202|doi=10.1016/s0168-6496(98)00086-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, depending on pH and temperature, methanogenesis has been shown to use carbon from other small organic compounds, such as [[formic acid]] (formate), [[methanol]], [[methylamines]], [[tetramethylammonium]], [[dimethyl sulfide]], and [[methanethiol]].  The catabolism of the methyl compounds is mediated by methyl transferases to give methyl coenzyme M.&lt;ref name="RT" /&gt;

===Proposed mechanism===
The biochemistry of methanogenesis involves the following coenzymes and cofactors: [[Coenzyme F420|F420]], [[coenzyme B]], [[coenzyme M]], [[methanofuran]], and [[methanopterin]].

The mechanism for the conversion of {{chem|CH|3|–S}} bond into methane involves a ternary complex of methyl coenzyme M and coenzyme B fit into a channel terminated by the axial site on nickel of the cofactor F430.  One proposed mechanism invokes electron transfer from Ni(I) (to give Ni(II)), which initiates formation of {{chem|CH|4}}.  Coupling of the coenzyme M [[thiyl radical]] (RS&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;) with HS coenzyme B releases a proton and re-reduces Ni(II) by one-electron, regenerating Ni(I).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Finazzo C, Harmer J, Bauer C, etal |title=Coenzyme B induced coordination of coenzyme M via its thiol group to Ni(I) of F&lt;sub&gt;430&lt;/sub&gt; in active methyl-coenzyme M reductase |journal=J.

===Reverse methanogenesis===
Some organisms can oxidize methane, functionally reversing the process of methanogenesis, also referred to as the [[anaerobic oxidation of methane]] (AOM). Organisms performing AOM have been found in multiple marine and freshwater environments including methane seeps, hydrothermal vents, coastal sediments and sulfate-methane transition zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruff|first=S.

===Importance in carbon cycle===
Methanogenesis is the final step in the decay of organic matter.  During the decay process, [[Oxidizing agent#Electron acceptor|electron acceptors]] (such as [[oxygen]], [[ferric]] [[iron]], [[sulfate]], and [[nitrate]]) become depleted, while [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[carbon dioxide]] accumulate.  Light organics produced by [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] also accumulate.  During advanced stages of organic decay, all electron acceptors become depleted except carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide is a product of most catabolic processes, so it is not depleted like other potential electron acceptors.

Only methanogenesis and fermentation can occur in the absence of electron acceptors other than carbon.  Fermentation only allows the breakdown of larger organic compounds, and produces small organic compounds.  Methanogenesis effectively removes the semi-final products of decay: hydrogen, small organics, and carbon dioxide.  Without methanogenesis, a great deal of carbon (in the form of fermentation products) would accumulate in anaerobic environments.

==Natural occurrence==

===In ruminants===
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1898 Testing Sheep for Methane Production.jpg|thumb|Testing Australian sheep for exhaled methane production (2001), [[CSIRO]]]]
[[Enteric fermentation]] occurs in the gut of some animals, especially ruminants. In the [[rumen]], anaerobic organisms, including methanogens, digest cellulose into forms nutritious to the animal.  Without these microorganisms, animals such as cattle would not be able to consume grasses. The useful products of methanogenesis are absorbed by the gut, but methane is released from the animal mainly by belching (eructation). The average cow emits around 250 liters of methane per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/ra/innovations/stories/s1159618.htm ''Radio Australia'': "Innovations – Methane In Agriculture."] 15 August  2004. Retrieved 28 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, ruminants contribute about 25% of anthropogenic [[methane emissions]]. One method of methane production control in ruminants is by feeding them [[3-Nitrooxypropanol|3-nitrooxypropanol]].&lt;ref&gt;Hristov, A. N., et al., "An inhibitor persistently decreased enteric methane emission from dairy cows with no negative effect on milk production", Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2015, volume 112, 10663-10668. {{DOI|10.1073/pnas.1504124112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In humans===
Some humans produce [[flatulence|flatus]] that contains methane.  In one study of the [[feces]] of nine adults, five of the samples contained [[archaea]] capable of producing methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Miller TL|author2=Wolin MJ |author3=de Macario EC |author4=Macario AJ | title=Isolation of Methanobrevibacter smithii from human feces| journal=Appl Environ Microbiol| year=1982| volume=43| pages=227–32 |pmid=6798932 |pmc=241804 |doi= |url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=6798932| issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar results are found in samples of gas obtained from within the [[rectum]].

Even among humans whose flatus does contain methane, the amount is in the range of 10% or less of the total amount of gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2007-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In plants===
Many experiments have suggested that [[leaf]] tissues of living plants emit methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Kepler F, etal | title = ''Methane emissions from terrestrial plants under aerobic conditions'' | journal = Nature | year = 2006 | volume = 439 | issue = 7073 | pmid = 16407949| pages = 187&amp;ndash;191 | doi=  10.1038/nature04420 | bibcode=2006Natur.439..187K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has indicated that the plants are not actually generating methane; they are just absorbing methane from the soil and then emitting it through their leaf tissues.&lt;ref&gt;http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2009/114/1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soils===
Methanogens are observed in anoxic soil environments, contributing to the degradation of organic matter.  This organic matter may be placed by humans through landfill, buried as sediment on the bottom of lakes or oceans as sediments, and as residual organic matter from sediments that have formed into sedimentary rocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Le Mer, J.|author2=Roger, P.|title=Production, oxidation, Emission and Consumption of Methane by Soils: A Review|journal=European Journal of Soil Biology|year=2001|volume=37|pages=25–50|doi=10.1016/S1164-5563(01)01067-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in global warming==
[[Atmospheric methane]] is an important [[greenhouse gas]] with a [[global warming potential]] 25 times greater than carbon dioxide (averaged over 100 years),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/tssts-2-5.html |contribution=Global Warming Potentials |title=Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007  |year=2007 |accessdate=2012-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and methanogenesis in [[livestock]] and the decay of organic material is thus a considerable contributor to global warming. It may not be a net contributor in the sense that it works on organic material which used up atmospheric carbon dioxide when it was created, but its overall effect is to convert the carbon dioxide into methane which is a much more potent greenhouse gas.

Methanogenesis can also be beneficially exploited, to treat [[organic waste]], to produce useful compounds, and the methane can be collected and used as [[biogas]], a fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-04-07/news/60902488_1_wet-waste-waste-management-household-waste|title=After Freedom Park, waste to light up Gandhinagar in Bengaluru
|last=Nair|first=Athira|work=Economic Times|date=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the primary pathway whereby most organic matter disposed of via [[landfill]] is broken down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ayoung/landfill.html DoE Report CWM039A+B/92] Young, A. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extra-terrestrial life==
{{See also|Methane#Extraterrestrial methane}}
The presence of atmospheric methane has a role in the scientific search for [[extra-terrestrial life]]. The justification is that methane in the atmosphere will eventually dissipate, unless something is replenishing it. If methane is detected (by using a [[spectrometer]] for example) this may indicate that life is, or recently was, present.
This was debated&lt;ref&gt;BBC article about methane as sign of life http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4295475.stm&lt;/ref&gt; when methane was discovered in the Martian atmosphere by M.J. Mumma of NASA's Goddard Flight Center, and verified by the [[Mars Express Orbiter]] (2004)&lt;ref&gt;European Space Agency, Methane in Martian Atmosphere http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Mars_Express/SEMZ0B57ESD_0.html&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]'s atmosphere by the [[Huygens probe]] (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Space.Com article about methane on Huygens http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/ap_huygens_update_050127.html&lt;/ref&gt; This debate was furthered with the discovery of 'transient', 'spikes of methane' on Mars by the [[Curiosity Rover]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/space/11297326/Life-on-Mars-Nasa-finds-first-hint-of-alien-life.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also argued that [[atmospheric methane]] can come from volcanoes or other fissures in the planet's crust and that without an [[isotopic signature]], the origin or source may be difficult to identify.&lt;ref&gt;New Scientist article about atmospheric methane https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7059&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Article about methane as sign of life http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/10/1007_041007_mars_methane.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2017, NASA confirmed that the dive of the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini orbiter]] spacecraft on 28 October 2015 discovered the [[Enceladus]] plume which has all the ingredients for methanogenesis-based life forms to feed from. Previous results, published in March 2015, suggested hot water is interacting with rock beneath the sea; the new findings support that conclusion and add that the rock appears to be reacting chemically. From these observations scientists have determined that nearly 98 percent of the gas in the plume is water, about 1 percent is hydrogen and the rest is a mixture of other molecules including carbon dioxide, methane and ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-missions-provide-new-insights-into-ocean-worlds-in-our-solar-system|title=NASA Missions Provide New Insights into 'Ocean Worlds'|last=Northon|first=Karen|date=2017-04-13|work=NASA|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52793">The theory of '''narrative identity''' postulates that individuals form an identity by integrating their life experiences into an internalized, evolving story of the self that provides the individual with a sense of unity and purpose in life.&lt;ref name = McAdams2001&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McAdams | first1 = D | year = 2001 | title = The psychology of life stories | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 100–122 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.5.2.100}}&lt;/ref&gt; This life [[narrative]] integrates one's reconstructed past, perceived present, and imagined future. Furthermore, this narrative is a story - it has characters, episodes, imagery, a setting, plots, and themes and often follows the traditional model of a story, having a beginning (initiating event), middle (an attempt and a consequence), and an end ([[denouement]]). Narrative identity is the focus of interdisciplinary research, with deep roots in [[psychology]].

==Context==

===Development===
Development of a child's narrative identity is largely influenced by the opportunities for narrative expression he or she has through conversations with caregivers and friends.  Speakers provide more accurate autobiographical information when speaking to attentive listeners as opposed to distracted listeners, therefore developing more specific autobiographical memories which give rise to richer personal narratives.&lt;ref name="Hoyt 2009 588-574"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoyt|first=Timothy|author2=Monisha Pasupathi|title=The Development of Narrative Identity in Late Adolescence and emergent Adult|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2009|volume=45|pages=558–574|doi=10.1037/a0014431|pmid=19271839}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young children whose parents share more detailed personal narratives from their own lives tend to have more detailed and coherent personal narratives themselves by the end of the preschool age period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singer|first=Jefferson|author2=Pavel BAglov |author3=Meredith Berry |author4=Kathryn M.

The development of life story narratives in adolescence is facilitated by co-constructed reminiscing, in which caregivers use discussion, comparison, and analysis of inner motivation to guide reflection about past events and create narratives that explain situations and behavior.  This helps adolescents develop an understanding of the relationship between the "self" of the past and their personal narrative in the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fivush|author2=Nelson|title=Parent-child reminiscing locates the self in the past.|journal=BRitish Journal of Developmental Psychology|year=2006|issue=1|pages=235–251|doi=10.1348/026151005X57747|volume=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;   An interesting finding from adolescent research shows more semantic stories increase and become more meaningful in a child's life.&lt;ref name="Chen 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Yan|author2=McAnally, Helena M. |author3=Wang, Qi |author4= Reese, Elaine |title=The coherence of critical event narratives and adolescents' psychological functioning|journal=Memory|date=October 2012|volume=20|issue=7|pages=667–681|doi=10.1080/09658211.2012.693934}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a child, especially a boy, makes stronger semantic connections in early adolescence, he has a worse sense of well-being, but as he moves to late adolescence his well-being increases.&lt;ref name="Chen 2012" /&gt; the large jump in cognitive learning during adolescence allows this change to take place.

===Personality psychology===
A person's narrative identity is a layer of personality related to, but distinct from the broad dispositional traits ([[Big Five personality traits|The Big Five]]) and contextualized characteristic adaptations, described in [[Dan P. McAdams]]'s three-level framework.&lt;ref name = "McAdams1995"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McAdams | first1 = D.P. | year = 1995 | title = What do we know when we know a person? | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 63 | issue = 3| pages = 365–395 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1995.tb00500.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dispositional traits, drawn from the Five-Factor Model of personality&lt;ref name="Goldberg, L.

Characteristic adaptations encompass a person's motivations, developmental concerns, and life strategies and are used to describe the individual within their contextualized time, place, and social roles. Narrative identity, the `third level in McAdams' framework encompasses the internalized, evolving story of the self. It is argued that assessing all three levels simultaneously gives you a personological description of the whole person.&lt;ref name = "McAdams2001"/&gt;

Different ways of interpreting and narrating life changes correlate with different forms of personality development.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2004 573–602"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bauer|first=Jack|author2=Dan McAdams|title=Personal Growth in Adults' Stories of Life Transitions|journal=Journal of Personality|year=2004|volume=72|issue=3|pages=573–602|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3506.2004.00273.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the close linkage between narrative identity and psychological well-being,&lt;ref name=BaergerMcAdams1999/&gt; a common research focus in narrative identity is in exploring the relationship between characteristics of narratives and how they relate to personality development in the domains of ego development and psychological well-being. Individuals who place a high importance on understanding new viewpoints show higher scores in ego development, and those that placed importance on interpersonal relationships, joy and societal contribution tend to have higher scores on well-being.&lt;ref name="Bauer 2004 573–602"/&gt;

===Epistemology===
Narrative can be approached through one of two epistemological paradigms: [[hermeneutic]] (also called "narrative"), or [[paradigmatic]].&lt;ref name = "Bruner1986"&gt;Bruner, J. "Two Modes of Thought," in Actual Minds, Possible World, (Harvard University Press, 1986), pp. 11-43.&lt;/ref&gt; The hermeneutic approach seeks to capture the specific, personal, and highly contextualized elements of an individual's story.&lt;ref name="Josselson2004"&gt;Josselson, Ruthellen (2004). "On Becoming the Narrator of One's own Life". In Lieblich, Amia, McAdams, Dan P., Josselson, Ruthellen (eds.) (2004). Healing Plots: The Narrative Basis of Psychotherapy (pp. 111–127). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The paradigmatic approach, on the other hand, tries to classify narratives, determine associations, draw cause-and-effect relationships, and test and validate hypotheses - to transcend the particulars that the hermeneutic approach primarily concerned with, to generate generalizable scientific findings.&lt;ref name = "Bruner1986"/&gt;

==Components of identity narratives==
Life narratives are often examined and evaluated by the presence and extent to which they contain various structural and thematic components.

===Structure===
Coherence is one of the primary structural elements of narratives.  As individuals develop from children to adults, four types of coherence emerge in their abilities to tell stories:&lt;ref name = Habermas2000/&gt;
*''Temporal coherence'': the telling of a story in a clear, chronological way, i.e. event B follows event A.
*''Causal coherence'': drawing cause-and-effect relationships between events in the narrative and also between events and their effect on the narrator's sense of self.&lt;ref name="Pals2006"/&gt;
*''Thematic coherence'': the narrator making a reflective evaluation of their story, revealing themes, overarching trends, and creating meaning from the narrative.
*''The cultural concept of biography'': the story assuming the format and prose common to the narrator's culture and context.

Some amount of coherence is always necessary in a narrative, otherwise it will be incomprehensible, while too much coherence may make the narrative hard to believe, as though it too-neatly ties together the complexity of life. The general extent to which coherence is present or absent in a narrative has been found to be related to a variety of important outcomes such as overall psychological well-being&lt;ref name="BaergerMcAdams1999"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baerger | first1 = D.R. | last2 = McAdams | first2 = D.P. | year = 1999 | title = Life story coherence and its relation to psychological well-being | url = | journal = Narrative Inquiry | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 69–96 | doi=10.1075/ni.9.1.05bae}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the nuance and complexity of meaning-making processes (ego development).&lt;ref name = Adler2007&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adler | first1 = J. | last2 = Wagner | first2 = J. | last3 = McAdams | first3 = D. | year = 2007 | title = Personality and the coherence of psychotherapy narratives | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 41 | issue = 6| pages = 1179–1198 | doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2007.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===
Turning to content, research on narrative identity has focused especially on the thematic elements of personal narratives. When participants in research studies are asked to recount a personal narrative, researchers code the story on the following seven constructs: redemption, contamination, agency, communion, exploratory narrative processing, coherent positive resolution, and meaning making.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAdams|first=Dan|title=Narrative Identity|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=4 June 2013|volume=22|issue=3|doi=10.1177/0963721413475622|pages=233–238}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional construct named performance has been newly recognized and also included in some researchers coding.&lt;ref name = Carless&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carless | first1 =  | last2 = Douglas | first2 =  | title = In the Boat but Selling Myself Short:Stories, Narratives, and Identity Development in Elite Sport | url = | journal = The Sport Psychologist | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 27–29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Redemption'': the narrator transitions from a generally "bad"/negative state, to a generally "good"/positive state (A → B). Such a transition can be characterized as being a ''sacrifice'' (enduring a negative event A to get the benefit of B), ''recovery'' (attaining a positive state after losing it), ''growth'' (bettering the self psychologically, physically, personally), or ''learning'' (gaining/mastering new skills, knowledge, wisdom).
*''Contamination'': the narrator transitions from a generally good/positive state, to a bad/negative state (B → A). Often, this transition is marked by a denial or not being able to remember the 'good' of the state before - it has been overwhelmed by the current 'bad' state. Common sub-themes in contamination include victimization, betrayal, loss, failure, illness/injury, disappointment, or disillusionment.
*''Agency'': refers to the extent to which the narrator is autonomous, and has the power to affect his/her own life. Agency is sometimes broken down into four pathways: ''self-mastery'' (the protagonist masters, enlarges, or betters the self), ''status/victory'' (the protagonist attains a heightened status or prestige amongst their peers), ''achievement/responsibility'' (the protagonist has significant achievement in some task, job, or goal), and ''empowerment'' (the protagonist is made better through an interaction with something larger and greater than the self).
*''Communion'': the narrator is motivated to form intimate friendships/relationships; showing intimacy, sharing, belonging, affiliation, etc. Common themes in communion are: ''love/friendship'', reciprocal and noninstrumental ''dialogue'', providence of ''caring/help'' to another, or a general feeling of ''unity/togetherness'' with the world/others.
*''Exploratory narrative processing'': the extent that the narrator engages in self-exploration while telling a story; a high score suggests profound self-exploration and/or a deep understanding of oneself.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The practice of exploratory narrative processing in times of struggle is one avenue through which maturity develops, and narratives of positive self-transformation are often characterized by increased exploratory narrative processing.&lt;ref name="Pals 2006 1079–1109"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pals|first=Jennifer|title=Narrative Identity Processing of Difficult Life Experiences: Pathways of Personality Development and Positive Self-Transformation in Adulthood|journal=Journal of Personality|year=2006|volume=4|issue=74|pages=1079–1109|doi=10.111/j.1467-6494.2006.00403}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Coherent positive resolution'': the extent to which tensions dissolve, providing closure and a satisfying ending to a narrative.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Increased coherent positive resolution in narratives correlate with improvements in ego-resiliency, or one's adaptability under stress.&lt;ref name="Pals 2006 1079–1109"/&gt;
*''[[Meaning-making]]'': the extent to which the narrator gleans meaning from a narrative. Scores on responses range from low (no meaning; narrator simply recounts story), moderate (extracting a concrete lesson from the story—for example: do not put hands on hot surfaces), to high (gaining a deep insight from the narrative—for example: learning that you can't judge a book by its cover).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLean|author2=Thorne|title=Adolescents' self-defining memories about relationships|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2003|volume=39|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.39.4.635|pages=635–645}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Performance'': The narrator describes life stories around the outcome of their performance.&lt;ref name="Carless"/&gt; This narrative tends to be seen typically among elite athletes. It can be considered a very dominant narrative since it is very accepted within the athletic community.&lt;ref name="Carless"/&gt;

==Research in narrative constructs==
The constructs mentioned above can vary in a narrative depending on the characteristics of the narrator and the circumstances of the story. Research on construct variance is conducted by having participants tell a story that is scored for some number of the eight narrative constructs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Individual characteristics===
The characteristics of a narrative can vary depending on age: during the adolescent years, narrative sophistication increases with age. For example, in one psychological study, adolescents aged 14 to 18 wrote narratives about significant turning points in their lifetimes. The researchers coded the narratives for meaning making. The results showed that age was positively correlated with meaning making scores.This suggests that the capability to incorporate meaning in life stories develops over the course of adolescence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLean|author2=Breen|title=Processes and content of narrative identity development in adolescence: Gender and well-being|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=May 2009|volume=45|issue=3|doi=10.1037/a0015207|pages=702–710|pmid=19413426}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics of a narrative can also vary depending on generativity (the degree to which an individual wishes to improve society and help future generations) and optimism. For example, in one study, participants narrated personally meaningful events from their pasts; these could be positive, negative turning point, or early childhood memories. Research participants with high generativity and optimism scores tended to have high narrative redemption scores.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McAdams|title=When  bad things turn good and good things turn bad: Sequences of redemption and contamination in life narrative and their relation to psychosocial adaptation in midlife adults and in students|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2001|volume=27|issue=4|doi=10.1177/0146167201274008|pages=474–485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in identity status also correlate with differences in narrative characteristics. The identity status theory of identity development examines an individual's exploration of identities and his or her commitment to an identity. There are four identity statuses: identity achievement (the most adjusted status and an integration of exploration and commitment), moratorium (exploration with no commitment), foreclosure (commitment with no exploration), and diffusion (no commitment or exploration). The foreclosure and diffusion identity statuses are the least developmentally advanced. In addition, they are associated with lower meaning making scores than achievement and moratorium.&lt;ref name="McLean 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLean|author2=Pratt|title=Life's little (and big) lessons: Identity statuses  and meaning-making in the turning point narratives of emerging adult|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2006|volume=42|issue=4|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.42.4.714|pages=714–722|pmid=16802903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal experience narrative is the very thread that identity is crafted from. During the storytelling process what people say, how they say it, and especially if they keep saying it, determines who they are and where they stand. The words you use, or diction, situates you in a social group. Voicing and ventriloquation of past selves positioned against current self or others yields a trajectory of narrative and an evaluative tool of the construction of self-identity. Represented content and enacted positioning, therefore, can interrelate in two ways so as to construct the self. Past voices can lie on trajectory towards the storytelling self, or map out and organize the present self. Along with creating a coherent sense of identity, this helps build empathy between speaker and audience, which deepens the connection of the speaker's own self-identity. One cannot become a 'self' alone, and thus the audience is vital to the creation of self through the positioning and arranging of past and current selves.&lt;ref name="Wortham, Stanton 2001"&gt;Wortham, Stanton. 2001. "Narrative Self-Construction and the Nature of Self." In Narratives in Action. New York: Teachers College Press, 136-156.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circumstances of the story===
The narrative constructs of a story can also depend on its plot. For example, the emotionality of a plot affects the characteristics of a story. In one study, 168 adolescents each recounted three self-defining narratives. Narratives containing negative and/or conflicting emotions receive higher meaning making scores than narratives containing positive or neutral emotions.&lt;ref name="McLean 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorne 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thorne|title=When Remembering Is Not  Enough: Reflecting on Self-Defining Memories in Late Adolescenc|journal=Journal of Personality|year=2004|volume=72|issue=3|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3506.2004.00271.x|pages=513–542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative themes can also depend on the event type. Different event types have varying levels of tension, and researchers posit that tension level is associated with narrative construct scores.For example, a mortality (or life-threatening) event would have a higher tension level than a leisure (i.e. vacation) event. Mortality narratives also receive higher meaning making scores than leisure narratives. Achievement (i.e. winning an award) and relationship events are posited to have mixed tension levels; for example, in relationship events, an interpersonal conflict would contain more emotional tension than falling in love. Achievement and relationship narratives also have varying meaning making scores.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thorne 2004"/&gt;

===Implications===
The use of narrative constructs is associated with well-being: people who incorporate negative life events into their narrative identities as instances of redemption tend to have higher instances of levels of happiness and well-being. For example, high school seniors who were able to find a positive outcome from a negative adolescent experience (redemption) had higher levels of well-being than students who could not find a silver lining.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tavernier|author2=Willoughby|title=Adolescent turning points: The association between meaning-making and psychological well-being|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=July 2012|volume=48|issue=4|doi=10.1037/a0026326|pages=1058–1068|pmid=22122472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the research on narrative constructs has not established causation: researchers do not know whether well-being causes redemption sequences in narratives, or whether redemption sequences cause well-being. Also, researchers do not know whether tension in a narrative causes meaning making, or whether meaning making leads to tension. Psychologists will need to determine causation before these findings can be practically implemented, such as in psychotherapy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Autobiographical memory==
The formation and organization of memories is the central mechanism through which narrative identity is constructed. The life story allows individuals to organize recollective memories and more abstract knowledge of their past into a coherent biographical view.&lt;ref name = Habermas2000/&gt; Different types of memories have been identified and classified, and have unique influences on how individuals develop their narrative self. Just as autobiographical memories influence personal narratives, these narratives also influence memories - For instance, narrative expression is critical for the development of a sense of agency in autobiographical memories.&lt;ref name="Hoyt 2009 588-574"/&gt;

The opportunity to tell stories about their lives can help autobiographical narrators establish a coherent sense of who they are.&lt;ref name="Wortham, Stanton 2001"/&gt; Charlotte Linde's definition of personal experience narrative is quintessential to the idea of narrative identity and is evidence into how these stories and the process of telling them craft the framework for one's own identity. [[Personal narrative]] is a powerful tool for creating, negotiating and displaying the moral standing of the self. The self has to be related to something, in this case an audience, but must also be related properly. Personal experience narrative culminates the discontinuity between inner experience and the portrayed self. The often hidden purpose of narratives as a social process is to show that the narrator knows what the norms are and agree with them, or depending on the audience, disagree with them. The very act of narrating creates the occasion for self-regard and editing. "The nature of the process of narration contributes to the creation of this reflexivity, because one can never immediately speak the present in the present. This necessarily creates a distinction between the narrator and the protagonist of the narrative, and interposes a distance between them. Consequently, the narrator can observe, reflect, adjust the amount of distance, and correct the self that is being created." Thus, temporal continuity- or identity of the self through time- is the most basic form of coherence we can create.&lt;ref&gt;Linde, Charlotte. 1993. 'Narrative and Iconicity of Self." In Life Stories: The Creation of Coherence. New York: Oxford University Press, 98–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative identity is mainly concerned with autobiographical memories and often are influenced by the meaning and emotions the individual has assigned to that event. These memories perform a self-representative function by using personal memories to create and maintain a coherent self-identity, or narrative identity, over time. Autobiographical memories that have to do with important goals within a certain period of life and correspond with the concerns of the present self have been termed "self-defining memories",&lt;ref name = Singer2004&gt;Singer, "The Integrative Function of Narrative Processing: Autobiographical Memory, Self-Defining Memories, and the Life Story of Identity", 2004, "[http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2004-18760-006]", April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and are especially important in narrative identity formation.  When these memories contain recurring emotion-outcome sequences (see: content), together they give rise to "narrative scripts." Development of a narrative identity that promotes psychological well-being requires combining autobiographical memory specificity, the ability to recall self-defining memories of specific instances in your past, with the narrative construct of meaning-making to attain insight from the narrative script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fivush|first1=R.| last2=Habermas|first2=T. |last3=Waters|first3=T.E. |last4=Zaman|first4=W. |title=The making of autobiographical memory: intersections of culture, narratives and identity |journal=[[International Journal of Psychology]] |date=October 2011|volume=5|issue=46|pages=321–345|doi=10.1080/00207594.2011.596541}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storytelling process==
Beyond the content of people's stories, the storytelling process is essential to understanding narrative identity.&lt;ref name = Mclean2007&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McLean | first1 = K. | last2 = Pasupathi | first2 = M. | last3 = Pals | first3 = J. | year = 2007 | title = Selves creating stories creating selves: a process model of self development | url = | journal = Personality and Social Psychological Review | volume = 11 | issue = | pages = 262–278 | doi=10.1177/1088868307301034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of stories, the role of the listener, and storytelling patterns all influence the way stories are told, and thus narrative identity.

Richard Bauman states that different forms of conversational genres (personal experience narrative, tall tale, practical joke), interrelatedly, add texture and flavor to one's life. The formats of the stories that we tell reveal truths about our own personal identity. Together, they provide the narrator with a toolset of means to figure him/ herself in a variety of alignments to a remarkably consistent and coherent set of epistemological and social-relational concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Bauman, Richard. 2004. 'Bell, You Get the Spotted Pup': First Person Narratives of a Texas Storyteller." In A World of Others' Words: Cross- Cultural Perspectives on Intertextuality, 109-127. Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bluck has conceptualized several reasons people tell narratives.  One reason is for ''directive'' purposes, which involves transmitting information regarding the future.  Additionally, stories are told for ''social reasons'', in particular communication, persuasion, and  entertainment purposes.  Finally, narrators can benefit by ''expressing themselves'', in addition to giving life purpose and meaning.&lt;ref name="Bluck2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bluck | first1 = S | year = 2003 | title = Special issue: Autobiographical memory: Exploring its functions in everyday life | url = | journal = Memory | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1080/741938206 | pages=113–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Listeners also possess power over the process of storytelling, and therefore the outcome of narrative identity. For instance, listener attentiveness elicits from the narrator more coherent stories, punchy endings, dynamic arcs over the course of the story, and overall, more specific and engaging stories.&lt;ref name = Bavelas2000 &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bavelas | first1 = J. B. | last2 = Coates | first2 = L. | last3 = Johnson | first3 = T. | year = 2000 | title = Listeners as co-narrators | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 79 | issue = | pages = 941–952 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.941}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Themes in narratives can influence the listener's attitude toward the storyteller.  For example, contamination sequences in bereavement narratives tend to elicit sympathy, while redemption sequences make the listener feel more comfortable and accepting of the narrator.&lt;ref name="Baddeley2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baddeley | first1 = J.L. | last2 = Singer | first2 = J.A | year = 2008 | title = Telling losses: Functions and personality correlates of bereavement narratives | url = | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 421–438 | doi=10.1016/j.jrp.2007.07.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both positive moods and the act of telling the story can influence the narrator's relationship with the listener - and lead to more intimate sharing by the narrator.&lt;ref name = "Bavelas2000"/&gt;

Storytelling patterns may also impact an individual's narrative identity. - for instance, untold experiences are more likely to be forgotten and considered less important.&lt;ref name = Pasupathi2007&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pasupathi | first1 = M | year = 2007 | title = Telling and the remembered self: Linguistic differences in memories for previously disclosed and previously undisclosed events | url = | journal = Memory | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | doi = 10.1080/09658210701256456 | pages=258–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that 90% of emotional experiences are disclosed within a few days of the event,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rime | first1 = B.|authorlink2=Batja Mesquita | last2 = Mesquita | first2 = B. | last3 = Boca | first3 = S. | last4 = Philippot | first4 = P. | year = 1991 | title = Beyond the emotional event: Six studies on the social sharing of emotion | url = | journal = Cognition &amp; Emotion | volume = 5 | issue = | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 62% of the "most memorable events of the day" are told by end of that day.&lt;ref name = Pasupathi2007/&gt; Those events that get forgotten cannot be included in the narrator's story of the self, and therefore cannot play a role in their identity.

Researchers focus on the storytelling process participants use in order to code the content the participants are showing. If a participant explains he or she participated in a sport not because he particularly liked it but because he could win, researchers would say he is using performance content to narrate his life.&lt;ref name=Carless /&gt; Storytelling is a very important piece to the methodology of narrative research for it provides variables the researchers can assess.

==Applications of narrative methods==

The concept of narrative identity, and its associated research techniques have been applied in a wide variety of fields.  Below are just a few examples:

===Gay and lesbian identity===
Narrative identity has been studied as it impacts the lives of lesbian and gay individuals.  Specifically, the concept of master narratives (story scripts common within a cultural context) has been investigated in this domain.  Studies have found that gay identity is often shaped by master narratives of gay identity in American culture, which have evolved over recent history. One of the foundational papers asserts that a study of gay identity must take into account cultural and historical factors.  The paper demonstrates that gay-identified individuals must navigate through a world where master narratives exclude their desires and experiences.&lt;ref name = Hammack2011&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hammack | first1 = P. L. | last2 = Cohler | first2 = B. J. | year = 2011 | title = Narrative, identity, and the politics of exclusion: Social change and the gay and lesbian life course | url = | journal = Sexuality Research and Social Policy | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 162–182 | doi=10.1007/s13178-011-0060-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychotherapy===
{{See also|Narrative therapy}}
Empirical research has demonstrated that narrative identity changes over the course of psychotherapy.  This change has been associated with improvements in clients' mental health. A prospective longitudinal study tracked clients' narrative identity from before they began treatment through the early phase of psychotherapy.&lt;ref name = Adler2012&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adler | first1 = J.M. | year = 2012 | title = Living into the story: Agency and coherence in a longitudinal study of narrative identity development and mental health over the course of psychotherapy | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 102 | issue = 2| pages = 367–389 | doi=10.1037/a0025289 | pmid=21910554}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The study demonstrated that clients told stories about their experiences with an increasing sense of agency over the course of treatment.  This increase in the theme of agency was associated with improvements in psychological health.  Analyses revealed that changes in clients' stories occurred before changes in their psychological health.  This finding suggests that narrative change may precede changes in mental health.

===Schizophrenia===
Narratives written by individuals with severe mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, have been studied in order to determine the potential influence of treatment using therapy and/or antipsychotic medication on narrative formation.  Studies have demonstrated that patients with schizophrenia develop more complex and dynamic narratives, but that the content of the narratives do not change a great deal over the course of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Lysaker, P.H., Lancaster, R. S., &amp; Lysaker, J. T. (2003). Narrative transformation as an outcome in the psychotherapy of schizophrenia. Psychology and Psychotherapy: Theory, Research and Practice, 76, 285-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have indicated that people with schizophrenia are better able to confront their illness after time spent in therapy, and subsequently develop more coherent narratives.&lt;ref name = Lysaker2005 /&gt;  These findings provide more insight into this disorder, and suggest new, more effective methods of treatment.

===Prisoners===
Narrative identity has been explored in the stories of incarcerated individuals.  For example, narratives have been used to understand the conversion experience among prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maruna | first1 = S. | last2 = Wilson | first2 = L. | last3 = Curran | first3 = K. | year = 2006 | title = Why God is often found behind bars: Prison conversion and the crisis of self-narrative | url = | journal = Research in Human Development | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 161–184 | doi=10.1080/15427609.2006.9683367}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through these narratives, prisoner converts have been able to integrate their negative self (the one who committed the crime) into their larger sense of self. They have also been able to exert control over their seemingly uncontrollable life while in prison.  Narratives have also been used to study the conversion stories of incarcerated women.  For these women, imprisonment causes dissonance between a conflict-self and a respectable identity. Conversion narratives help free women to reclaim their identities and sense of self-worth.&lt;ref name = Rowe2011&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rowe | first1 = A. | year = 2011 | title = Narratives of self and identity in women's prisons: Stigma and the struggle for self-definition in penal regimes | url = | journal = [[Punishment and Society]] | volume = 13 | issue = 5| pages = 571–591 | doi=10.1177/1462474511422151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical practice===
{{See also|Narrative medicine}}
Medical practice that embraces the importance of stories exchanged in the medical context has been termed "narrative medicine".&lt;ref name = Charon2001&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charon | first1 = R | year = 2001 | title = Narrative medicine: A model for empathy, reflection, profession, and trust | url = | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 286 | issue = 15| pages = 1897–1902 | doi=10.1001/jama.286.15.1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative medicine allows for more effective care by physicians and more comfort for patients by providing new ways to consider the relationships and practices involved in medicine. Some of these relationships include those between the physician and patient, physician and self, physician and colleagues, and physician and society. This form of practice allows patients to overcome their loss of identity and benefit their recovery process.&lt;ref name=Kerr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kerr|first=Douglas J. R.|author2=Crowe, Trevor P. |author3=Oades, Lindsay G. |title=The reconstruction of narrative identity during mental health recovery: A complex adaptive systems perspective.|journal=Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal|year=2013|volume=36|issue=2|pages=108–109|doi=10.1037/h0094978}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicians help the patients find new connections between their narrative stories and identity for the patients to find different options and outlooks on their recovery.&lt;ref name=Kerr /&gt; With new connections, the patient can lead a healthier life with a positive outlook instead of revolving their lives around their illness.

===Athletes===
When assessing an athlete it is beneficial to understand how one describe his or her life since it can determine how mentally healthy he or she is. If there is a strong athletic identity, like the performance narrative, sometimes severe psychological problems can form when the athlete is in a slump  or injured.&lt;ref name="Carless"/&gt;&lt;ref name= Brewer&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brewer | first1 = Van Raalte | last2 = Linder | first2 =  | title = Athletic Identity: Hercules' muscle or Achilles Heel? | url = | journal = International Journal of Sport Psychology | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 237–254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Observing an athlete's narrative can help one shift his or her attention away from only the performance narrative but combine it with others. One can reach the elite level of athletes without only focusing on the performance script.&lt;ref name="Carless"/&gt; Some actually attempt to follow the script but it does not help them succeed due to the clash of the cultural norm and what is desired by the athlete.&lt;ref name="Carless"/&gt;

'''Nepal Bhasa movement''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: नेपालभाषा आन्दोलन) refers to the struggle for [[linguistic rights]] by its speakers in [[Nepal]] in the face of opposition from the government and hostile neighbors. The campaign aims to increase the use of Nepal Bhasa in the home, education, government and business. Despite a high level of development, Newar culture and language are both under threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |title= Between the market and Comrade Mao: Newar cultural activism and ethnic/political movements (Nepal) |last= Grandin |first= Ingemar |date= |website= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement arose against the suppression of the language by the state that began with the rise of the [[Shah dynasty]] in 1768 AD, and intensified during the Rana regime (1846-1951) and [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system (1960-1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singh|first=Phatte Bahadur|title=Nepali Biharya Aitihasik Pristabhumi ("Historical Background of Nepali Bihar") |url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Jaa|publisher=Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Pala, Tri-Chandra Campus|date=September 1979}} Page 186.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Bal Gopal|title=The Newars: The Indigenous Population of the Kathmandu Valley in the Modern State of Nepal |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_26_01_04.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, hostility towards the language from neighbors grew following mass migration into the [[Kathmandu Valley]], leading to the indigenous Newars becoming a minority in their homeland. During the period 1952 to 1991, the percentage of the valley population speaking Nepal Bhasa dropped from 74.95% to 43.93%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpmalla.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/the-occupation-of-the-kathmandu..pdf |title=The Occupation of the Kathmandu Valley and its Fallout |last=Malla |first=Kamal P. |date= |website= |page=3 |publisher= |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The language has been listed as being "definitely endangered" by UNESCO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.unesco.org/culture/languages-atlas/index.php?hl=en&amp;page=atlasmap&amp;lid=1117 |title = UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger |date = |accessdate= 27 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The language movement can be divided into the following eras.

*Shah/Rana era
*First democratic era
*Panchayat era
*Second democratic era
*Loktantra era

==Shah/Rana era==

''Jheegu Sahitya'' ("Our Literature"). Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Parisad. Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, development of the language and literature was stifled.

During the period 1909 to 1941 known as the Renaissance era, a few authors braved official disapproval and started writing, translating, educating and restructuring the language. Writers [[Nisthananda Bajracharya]], [[Siddhidas Mahaju]], [[Jagat Sundar Malla]] and [[Yogbir Singh Kansakar]] are honored as the [[Four Pillars of Nepal Bhasa]]. [[Shukraraj Shastri]] and [[Dharmaditya Dharmacharya]] were also at the forefront of the movement.

In 1909, Bajracharya published the first printed book using movable type. Shastri wrote a grammar of the language entitled ''Nepal Bhasa Vyakarana'' which was published from [[Kolkata]], [[India]] in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;Bajracharya, Phanindra Ratna (2003). ''Who's Who in Nepal Bhasha.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. Page 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Dharmacharya published the first magazine in Nepal Bhasa ''[[Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa]]'' from Kolkata in 1925. Also, the Renaissance marked the beginning of the movement to get official recognition for the name "Nepal Bhasa" in place of the [[Khas]] imposed term "Newari".

===Writers jailed===

In 1940, the government mounted a crackdown against democracy activists and writers in which Shukraraj Shastri was hanged. A large number of authors were imprisoned for their literary or political activities. Dharmacharya was jailed for three months. [[Chittadhar Hridaya]] was sentenced to six years, [[Siddhicharan Shrestha]] was sentenced to 18 years, [[Phatte Bahadur Singh]] was sentenced to life imprisonment and [[Dharma Ratna Yami]] was sentenced to 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Siddhi Charan|title=97 Sal Parva|url= |accessdate= |newspaper=Inap Vol. 1, No. 3|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were released in 1945 after serving five years. In prison, Hridaya produced his greatest work [[Sugata Saurabha (epic)|''Sugata Saurabha'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/oso/public/content/religion/9780195341829/toc.html|title=Sugata Saurabha: An Epic Poem from Nepal on the Life of the Buddha by Chittadhar Hridaya |publisher=Oxford Scholarship Online|accessdate=24 January 2012|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an epic poem on the life of the [[Buddha]].&lt;ref name="Lienhard, Siegfried 1992 Page 4"/&gt; Shrestha wrote a collection of poems entitled ''Seeswan'' ("Wax Flower", published in 1948) among other works.

===Monks expelled===

[[Theravada Buddhist]] monks stood up to the Rana regime and published books on Buddhism from India and brought them into Nepal. This led to the [[Banishment of Buddhist monks from Nepal]]. In 1944, eight monks were expelled for refusing to stop teaching Theravada Buddhism and writing in Nepal Bhasa. In 1946, the ban on writing was lifted, and the monks were allowed to return to Nepal following international pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whelpton |first=John |title=A History of Nepal |url= https://books.google.com/?id=KoNT6tjk9mQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a+history+of+nepal#v=onepage&amp;q=1946&amp;f=false |accessdate= 3 July 2013|year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=9780521804707 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their writings and public activities in Nepal Bhasa had a profound impact on the development of the language.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N.

===Working abroad===

Nepal Bhasa lovers took the movement to [[India]] and [[Tibet]] where they formed associations to organize writers and bring out publications to escape government suppression in Nepal. Newar merchants based in [[Kolkata]], [[Kalimpong]] and [[Lhasa]] were major patrons of the language movement.

''[[Buddha Dharma wa Nepal Bhasa]]'', the first ever magazine in Nepal Bhasa, was published from Kolkata in 1925 by [[Dharmaditya Dharmacharya]]. He also established a literary organization named Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Mandal (Nepal Bhasa Literature Organization) in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005) ''Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal.'' Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-674-01908-9}}. Pages 27-28.

In 1944, the Buddhist monks expelled from Nepal went to [[Sarnath]] and formed an organization named Dharmodaya Sabha. In 1947, it launched ''[[Dharmodaya]]'' magazine from [[Kalimpong]] funded by trader Maniharsha Jyoti Kansakar. Monk [[Aniruddha Mahathera]] was the first editor.&lt;ref&gt;LeVine, Sarah and Gellner, David N. (2005) ''Rebuilding Buddhism: The Theravada Movement in Twentieth-Century Nepal.''

Newar traders based in Lhasa promoted ''[[Thaunkanhe]]'' magazine which launched in Kathmandu in 1951. It was the first Nepal Bhasa magazine to be published from Nepal, and the first editor was a former merchant [[Purna Kaji Tamrakar]].

In 1950, a literary society named Chwasa Pasa (Pen Friend) was formed in [[Kolkata]] by [[Prem Bahadur Kansakar]] and another writer Madan Lochan Singh to bring together writers living in exile. The society moved to Nepal in 1951 after the advent of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000). ''Nepal Bhasa Sahityaya Itihas: The History of Nepalbhasa Literature.'' Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Academy. {{ISBN|99933-560-0-X}}. Page 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==First democratic era==

Following the fall of the Ranas and advent of democracy in 1951, there was greater linguistic freedom, and Nepal Bhasa struggled to catch up. Books, magazines and newspapers appeared. A daily newspaper ''[[Nepal Bhasa Patrika]]'' began publication in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://npi10month.blogspot.com/2010/02/history-of-nepali-journalism.html| title =History of Nepali Journalism| work = | publisher =Nepal Press Institute| date=15 February 2010| accessdate = 25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the radio===

State-owned [[Radio Nepal]] began broadcasting the news in Nepal Bhasa once a day in 1951. In 1958, Kathmandu Municipality passed a resolution that it would accept applications and publish major decisions in Nepal Bhasa in addition to the Nepali language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Sandhya Times|date=1 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In schools and colleges===

Nepal Bhasa entered a vibrant phase in the educational system. It was included in the curriculum, and Nepal Rastriya Vidhyapitha recognized it as an alternative medium of instruction in the schools and colleges affiliated to it. In 1953, the government recognized Nepal Bhasa as a spoken language and an oriental language subject. The Nepal Educational Council adopted it as an optional subject.

Following lobbying by language lovers, Nepal Bhasa was included in the course of study at the high school level in 1954, at the intermediate level in 1960 and bachelor level in 1962. And for two decades, Nepal Bhasa was widely taught in schools and colleges in the [[Kathmandu Valley]] and other parts of Nepal with thousands of students studying it as an optional subject.&lt;ref name="Hoek, Bert van den and Shrestha, Balgopal"/&gt;

==Panchayat era==

In 1960, parliament was abolished, political parties were forbidden and the [[Panchayat (Nepal)|Panchayat]] system was established. Under this autocratic system, the government followed a one-language policy, and Nepal Bhasa suffered another period of suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Whelpton |first=John |title=A History of Nepal |url= https://books.google.com/?id=KoNT6tjk9mQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=a+history+of+nepal#v=onepage&amp;q=1946&amp;f=false |accessdate= 3 July 2013|year=2005 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=9780521804707 |page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lawoti| first = Mahendra | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Lsjb4lexL1cJ:homepages.wmich.edu/~mlawoti/documents/PDF%2520Docs/ContentiousPolitics%26democratization.Lawoti.CPDN.Sage.pdf+buddhist+monks+expelled+from+nepal&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiqCfNrBWEOZ6J7vIgrqxMtVaKmvuuZHn4vr7DvQWUfsAbu8t6d0JVPUEiJs029IqiE17jUa-PlWyW-P_7yhRQJGCY3TPLi0k8qeFHj3pN33Exmpapqt-C9tohC7csDBREWViLL&amp;sig=AHIEtbTqR7b-EKriitUP0R55RhzLmEtMLA|title = Contentious Politics in Democratizing Nepal | work = | publisher = | date=| accessdate = 3 June 2012}} Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; It was gradually pushed out of the media and the educational institutions, triggering protest movements.&lt;ref name="Shrestha"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shrestha|first=Bal Gopal|title=The Newars: The Indigenous Population of the Kathmandu Valley in the Modern State of Nepal|url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_26_01_04.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1999}} Page 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The restrictive policy of Panchayat encouraged the formation of literary associations to provide a forum for writers to present their works. In 1962, Birat Nepal Bhasa Sahitya Sammelan Guthi (Grand Nepal Bhasa Literary Conference Trust) was formed in [[Bhaktapur]]. It organized annual literary meets which continue till today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal Bhasha literary meet concludes |url=http://www.gorkhapatra.org.np/detail.php?article_id=8143&amp;cat_id=4|accessdate=18 May 2012|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=12 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jah'' magazine===

In 1960, Nepal Bhasa students at Tri-Chandra College in Kathmandu launched an annual magazine named ''Jah'' (ज:) (meaning "light" in Nepal Bhasa) after the college magazine ''Light'' refused to include Nepal Bhasa articles in it. The magazine led to the organization of students interested in Nepal Bhasa in the college. That same year, they started the annual Inter-College Nepal Bhasa Literary Conference and also produced a weekly radio program in Nepal Bhasa on Radio Nepal named ''Jeevan Dabu'' ("Life's stage"). In the successive years, ''Jah'' served as a breeding ground for new writers and language activists.&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000).

===Movement of 1965===

In 1963, Kathmandu Municipality's decision to recognize Nepal Bhasa was revoked. In 1965, the language was banned from being broadcast over Radio Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Timalsina|first=Ramji |title=Language and Political Discourse in Nepal|url=http://koshistjames.edu.np/journal/CET_Journal_Vol3_No1.pdf|accessdate=28 February 2012|newspaper=CET Journal|publisher=Itahari: Itahari Research Centre, Circle of English Teachers (CET)|date=Spring 2011}} Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gurung |first=Kishor |date=Nov–Dec 1993 |title=What is Nepali Music? |url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/himal/pdf/Himal_6_6.pdf |journal=Himal |location=Kathmandu |page=11 |accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of Nepal Bhasa from the country's only radio station sparked a protest movement which became known as the Movement of 1965 ("Bais Salya Andolan"). The protest took the form of literary meets as other types of demonstrations were prohibited. Literary programs were held weekly in market squares and courtyards where participants recited poems and sang songs containing critical messages.

The government cracked down by putting a number of activists in jail including writers Mangal Man Shakya, Pushpa Gopal Shrestha and Shree Krishna Anu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tumbahang | first = Govinda Bahadur | url = http://tujournal.edu.np/index.php/TUJ/article/view/18/16| title = Process of Democratization and Linguistic (Human) Rights in Nepal| work =Tribhuvan University Journal | publisher = | date= September 2009| accessdate = 3 October 2012}} Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buddhist]] monk Bhikshu [[Sudarshan Mahasthavir]] was jailed for six months and six days.&lt;ref&gt;Shrestha, Ishwari Maiya (2010).

Page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent campaigners like [[Durga Lal Shrestha]], Hitkar Bir Singh Kansakar and Mangal Man Shakya (of Om Bahal) were forced to go underground. The movement was made leaderless, and it came to a stop after a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Maharjan | first = Basanta | url = https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:u07wVOvD30YJ:www.socialinclusion.org.np/download.php%3Fp%3DresearchReport%26f%3D7996_Finalreport.doc+nepal+bhasa+radio+1965&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi9256j5vkAtxFmzLXi31AD1N_do6qcAL7_ULYcy41D7GeijuqJfwFf6QOzNSGbBVqAtC19vXNAftsB0vo841MGc1Igbje0xHXvmIkJtrPZcGLYjePEFO3Vvf1DUbefX-eLE5sX&amp;sig=AHIEtbTzWjezYJYvu6s-gHS7nSKs5N3RFw

The ban on Nepal Bhasa remained, but the 1965 Movement succeeded in raising awareness about linguistic rights and arousing public opinion against the Panchayat regime. Its most important achievement was creating a new generation of writers and campaigners who would take over from the activists who fought for the language during the Rana regime and lead the movement in the subsequent decades.&lt;ref name="Shrestha"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tuladhar, Prem Shanti (2000).

Page 118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nepal Bhasa Manka Khala]], founded in 1979, is one of the organizations that emerged during this period to struggle for language rights.

===Out of school===

The New Education System Plan brought out in 1971 disrupted the popular study of Nepal Bhasa in educational institutions. Under the plan, vernacular subjects were removed from the curriculum, and students were forced to choose between the mother tongue and technical subjects, leading to Nepal Bhasa being pushed into the background. Student enrolment in the course dropped, resulting in the subject being pulled out of many schools and a further decline in students.

From 1977, students could study Nepal Bhasa at the Master's level; but the university degree was not counted for promotion by the government, and so there were few takers for the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hangen| first =Susan| url = http://www.eastwestcenter.org/fileadmin/stored/pdfs/ps034.pdf| title =Creating a "New Nepal": The Ethnic Dimension| work = | publisher =Washington: East-West Center| year=2007| accessdate = 19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thlib.org"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Hoek, Bert van den  |author2=Shrestha, Balgopal |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Education in the Mother Tongue: The Case of Nepal Bhasa (Newari) |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/contributions/CNAS_22_01_06.pdf |accessdate=22 April 2012|newspaper=CNAS Journal|date=January 1995}} Page 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign radio===

In addition to government suppression, Nepal Bhasa has faced opposition from hostile critics. After [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] began broadcasting a weekly half-hour program in Nepal Bhasa on 6 November 1983, opponents in Nepal pressured the radio station to shut it down. Similar opposition led to [[All India Radio]] - Kurseong stopping broadcasting Nepal Bhasa songs during its Nepali service in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dakalay Nhapan|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Bhintuna-Pau|publisher=Kathmandu: Nepal Bhasa Manka Khala |year=1993}} Page 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=Inap|publisher= |date=22 February 1984}} Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second democratic era==

Arbitrary actions increased resentment towards Panchayat. In 1988, police arrested participants in a procession marking the birth anniversary of Nepal Bhasa poet [[Siddhidas Mahaju]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tumbahang | first = Govinda Bahadur | url = http://tujournal.edu.np/index.php/TUJ/article/view/18/16| title = Process of Democratization and Linguistic (Human) Rights in Nepal| work =Tribhuvan University Journal | publisher = | date= September 2009| accessdate = 3 October 2012}} Page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After the [[1990 People's Movement]] that brought the Panchayat system to an end, the languages of Nepal enjoyed greater freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Eagle|first=Sonia|title=The Language Situation in Nepal|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/57090514/19/Newari-language-and-revitalisation|accessdate=28 February 2012|newspaper=Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development|publisher=Scribd|year=1999}} Page 310.&lt;/ref&gt; However, efforts to get Nepal Bhasa reincluded as an optional subject after a gap of two decades were unsuccessful due to lack of funding.

The 1990 constitution recognized Nepal as a multi-ethnic and multilingual country. It also said that each community shall have the right to operate schools up to the primary level in its own mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nepaldemocracy.org/documents/national_laws/constitution1990.htm#1|title=Constitution of Nepal 1990|publisher=Nepal Democracy|accessdate=19 February 2012|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government's responsibility was not stated and communities had to open such schools on their own. In 1991, Jagat Sundar Bwane Kuthi, the first Nepal Bhasa-medium school, opened in Kathmandu with the efforts of volunteers and the support of domestic and foreign donors.&lt;ref name="thlib.org"/&gt;

Meanwhile, years of efforts to gain official recognition for the standard name Nepal Bhasa finally succeeded. On 8 September 1995, the government decided that the name Nepal Bhasa should be used instead of Newari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Nepal Bhasa|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=9 September 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Central Bureau of Statistics has not been doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Major-Finding.pdf| title =Major highlights| work =| publisher =Central Bureau of Statistics| year =2013| accessdate =24 May 2013| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130717170017/http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Major-Finding.pdf| archivedate =17 July 2013| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critics file suit===

On 25 July 1997, [[Kathmandu Metropolitan City]] declared that its policy to recognize Nepal Bhasa, which had been passed on 18 April 1958 and cancelled by the Panchayat regime in 1963, would be revived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=|url= |accessdate=|newspaper=Sandhya Times|date=1 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of the city governments in the Kathmandu Valley announced in quick succession that they too would officially recognize Nepal Bhasa -- [[Patan, Lalitpur|Lalitpur]] Sub-Metropolitan City on 14 July, [[Bhaktapur]] Municipality on 23 July, [[Madhyapur Thimi]] Municipality on 10 September, and [[Kirtipur]] Municipality on 15 September 1997.

While Newars hailed the move, its detractors went to court. A group consisting of Lal Bahadur Thapa, Yagyanidhi Dahal, Hari Prasad Pokhrel, Achyut Raman Adhikari and Dhruba Raj Thebe filed a joint petition at the [[Supreme Court of Nepal]] against their decision. And on 18 March 1998, the Supreme Court issued a stay order preventing Kathmandu Metropolitan City from using Nepal Bhasa pending a final verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Use Nepali, directs SC|url=|accessdate=|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=19 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stay order to KMC to stop using Newari|url=|accessdate= |newspaper=The Rising Nepal|date=20 March 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, on 1 June 1999, the Supreme Court quashed the decision of the local bodies as being unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tumbahang | first = Govinda Bahadur | url = http://tujournal.edu.np/index.php/TUJ/article/view/18/16| title = Process of Democratization and Linguistic (Human) Rights in Nepal| work =Tribhuvan University Journal | publisher = | date= September 2009| accessdate = 3 October 2012}} Page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nepal&gt;{{cite news|last=Limbu|first=Ramyata|title=Attempt to Limit Official Language to Nepali Resented|url=http://ipsnews.net/print.asp?idnews=79142|publisher=IPS|accessdate=8 January 2012|newspaper=|date=21 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the verdict was announced, demonstrators marched through Kathmandu in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thenepaldigest.org/archive/the-nepal-digest-june%2016-1999.html |title= SC quashes decisions on local languages | newspaper= The Kathmandu Post |date=2 June 1999 |website=|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Day===

Newars have been observing June 1 as Black Day with protest meets and public demonstrations recalling the day when the Supreme Court barred Nepal Bhasa from being used in local bodies. On some occasions, the protests have been marked by vandalism and arrest of protestors by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kathmandu's sons go on warpath|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-01/south-asia/28196200_1_kathmandu-nepali-congress-girija-prasad-koirala|accessdate=17 May 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loktantra era==

A second People's Movement in 2006 ousted the Shah dynasty and Nepal became a republic which gave the people greater linguistic freedom. The 2007 Interim Constitution stated that the use of one's mother tongue in a local body or office shall not be barred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccd.org.np/new/resources/interim.pdf|title=The Interim Constitution of Nepal, 2063 (2007)|publisher=UNDP Nepal|accessdate=19 February 2012|date=January 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219220657/http://www.ccd.org.np/new/resources/interim.pdf|archivedate=19 February 2012|df=}} Page 56.&lt;/ref&gt; However, subtle discrimination persists.

== Origin ==

The NMI was started by the Effective Philanthropy Group at the [[Hewlett Foundation]] in 2006 with the goal that "by 2015, ten percent of individual philanthropic donations in the US (or $20 billion), would be influenced by meaningful, high-quality information about nonprofit organizations’ performance."&lt;ref name=guidestar/&gt;&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt;&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt; Jacob Harold was the program officer responsible, and the Hewlett Foundation at the time was headed by [[Paul Brest]].

== Organizations funded ==

The NMI funded a number of [[charity evaluator]]s including:&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt;

* [[GiveWell]], that was focused on finding the very best charities to donate to&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt;
* [[Charity Navigator]]&lt;ref name=cn/&gt; and [[Guidestar]], that were focused more on rating large numbers of charities using clearly defined metrics
* [[Philanthropedia]], a platform for experts to rate charities
* [[GreatNonprofits]], a platform for people to share information about great charities

[[Holden Karnofsky]], co-founder and co-executive director of GiveWell, expressed gratitude to the NMI, saying that NMI's support of the organization was crucial in its first few years, when it was relatively unknown and the subject of unfavorable controversies. He also praised the NMI for their support despite differences in strategy and approach, and said that while the NMI often encouraged them to spread a wider net and collaborate more with other NMI grantees, they were never inappropriately pressured.&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt;

Ken Berger, President of [[Charity Navigator]], wrote a letter upon the closure of the NMI thanking the Hewlett Foundation for their generous support of Charity Navigator through their transition to version 3.0 of their product. Berger identified the Hewlett Foundation as the single biggest overall supporter of Charity Navigator.&lt;ref name=cn&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&amp;cpid=1734#.VmPejcoqRxU|title = President and CEO's Report for May 2014|date = May 6, 2014|accessdate = December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closure ==

In April 2014, an article the ''[[Chronicle of Philanthropy]]'' announced that the Hewlett Foundation was ending the Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative.&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt; The Hewlett Foundation's decision was based on an internal re-evaluation of the project, motivated by two external pieces of information:&lt;ref name=chronicle/&gt;

* The Money For Good study conducted by Hope Consulting (paid for by the Hewlett Foundation) whose headline result was "few donors do research before they give, and those that do look to the nonprofit itself to provide simple information about efficiency and effectiveness."&lt;ref name=mfg&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hopeconsulting.us/work/money-for-good|title = Money for Good|publisher = Hope Consulting|accessdate = December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.givewell.org/2010/07/20/the-money-for-good-study/|title = The Money for Good study|last = Hassenfeld|first = Elie|date = July 20, 2010|accessdate = December 5, 2015|publisher = [[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An external evaluation from Arabella Advisors whose results further convinced the Hewlett Foundation that their strategy was not working anywhere near as well as they hoped.&lt;ref name=hewlett-more&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hewlett.org/blog/posts/more-our-decision-end-nonprofit-marketplace-initiative|title = More on Our Decision to End the Nonprofit Marketplace Initiative|last = Wickline|first = Heath|date = May 12, 2014|accessdate = December 6, 2015|publisher = [[Hewlett Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hewlett Foundation also had some significant personnel changes over the time period: Jacob Harold left the Hewlett Foundation for [[GuideStar]] and was replaced by Lindsay Louise, while [[Paul Brest]] was replaced by [[Larry Kramer (legal scholar)|Larry Kramer]] as President of the Hewlett Foundation. They said that these changes made it more logical for them to re-evaluate the strategy, but was not the reason for ending the program, since the external studies and evaluations that would lead to the program's cosure had been initiated under the previous staff.&lt;ref name=chronicle-more&gt;{{cite web|url = https://philanthropy.com/article/Hewlett-Foundation-Should-Be/153147|title = Hewlett Foundation Should Be More Open About Shuttered Program|last = Schambra|first = William|date = May 12, 2014|accessdate = December 6, 2015|publisher = ''[[Chronicle of Philanthropy]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hewlett-more/&gt;&lt;ref name=alliance&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.alliancemagazine.org/blog/interview-fay-twersky-hewlett-foundation/|title = Interview: Fay Twersky, Hewlett Foundation (£)|date = July 4, 2014|accessdate = December 6,  2015|publisher = ''Alliance magazine''|last = Hartnell|first = Caroline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hewlett Foundation also clarified that even though they had failed to met their own goals with the NMI, the organizations they funded, such as [[GiveWell]], [[Charity Navigator]], and [[GuideStar]], had done a great job at meeting ''those organization's'' goals.&lt;ref name=hewlett-more/&gt;

Responding to the closure decision, [[Holden Karnofsky]] of [[GiveWell]] wrote that while the decision to shut down the program may have been the right one, GiveWell did not agree with the stated reasons for closure. Karnofsky argued that GiveWell's money moved in the years to come would alone more than justify the grand total of 12 million dollars spent on the NMI.&lt;ref name=givewell/&gt; This would be validated in the years to come: in 2014, GiveWell moved $13.0 million to its top charities from donors ''excluding'' [[Good Ventures]], a multi-billion dollar foundation it works closely with.&lt;ref name=impact&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.givewell.org/about/impact|title = Evaluating GiveWell's impact|date = April 1, 2015|accessdate = December 6, 2015|publisher = [[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacob Harold, the program officer formerly responsible for NMI, who had since left for [[GuideStar]], responded to Karnofsky's post, noting that the NMI's goals of reaching a large population were still worthwhile, and that its main problem may have been that it was too early for its time. Harold noted that he hoped to make the vision the NMI sought a reality through his work for GuideStar. He emphasized the importance of both quality and quantity, noting that GiveWell and the [[effective altruism]] movement it was part of might be too neglectful of the quantity goals that the NMI had.&lt;ref name=guidestar/&gt;

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Obsessive–compulsive disorder''' ('''OCD''') is a [[mental disorder]] where people feel the need to check things repeatedly, perform [[compulsive behavior|certain routines repeatedly]] (called "rituals"), or have [[intrusive thoughts|certain thoughts repeatedly]] (called "obsessions").&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; People are unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Common activities include [[hand washing]], counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Some may have difficulty throwing things out.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; These activities occur to such a degree that the person's daily life is negatively affected.&lt;ref name=NIH2015&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?|url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/index.shtml|website=U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH)|author=The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)|date=January 2016|accessdate=24 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160723194024/http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/obsessive-compulsive-disorder-ocd/index.shtml|archivedate=23 July 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often takes up more than an hour a day.&lt;ref name=DSM5&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders : DSM-5|date=2013|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|pages=237–242|edition=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most adults realize that the behaviors do not make sense.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; The condition is associated with [[tic disorders|tics]], [[anxiety disorder]], and an increased risk of [[suicide]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ang2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angelakis|first1=I|last2=Gooding|first2=P|last3=Tarrier|first3=N|last4=Panagioti|first4=M|title=Suicidality in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): A systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|publisher=[[Pergamon Press]]|location=Oxford, England|date=25 March 2015|volume=39|pages=1–15|pmid=25875222|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2015.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cause is unknown.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; There appear to be some [[genetics|genetic]] components with both [[identical twins]] more often affected than both non-identical twins.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Risk factors include a history of [[child abuse]] or other [[stress (psychological)|stress]]-inducing event.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Some cases have been documented to occur following [[infection]]s.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; The diagnosis is based on the symptoms and requires ruling out other drug related or medical causes.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Rating scales such as the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS) can be used to assess the severity.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fenske JN, Schwenk TL | title = Obsessive compulsive disorder: diagnosis and management | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–45 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19621834 | doi =  | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0801/p239.html | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140512222223/http://www.aafp.org/afp/2009/0801/p239.html | archivedate = 12 May 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other disorders with similar symptoms include anxiety disorder, [[major depressive disorder]], [[eating disorders]], [[tic disorders]], and [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment and prognosis --&gt;
Treatment involves [[psychotherapy|counseling]], such as [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), and sometimes [[antidepressants]] such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) or [[clomipramine]].&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ve2014 /&gt; CBT for OCD involves increasing exposure to what causes the problems while not allowing the repetitive behavior to occur.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014&gt;{{cite journal | author = Grant JE | title = Clinical practice: Obsessive-compulsive disorder. | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 371 | issue = 7 | pages = 646–53 | date = 14 August 2014 | pmid = 25119610 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMcp1402176}}&lt;/ref&gt; While clomipramine appears to work as well as SSRIs, it has greater side effects so is typically reserved as a second line treatment.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt; [[Atypical antipsychotic]]s may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in treatment-resistant cases but are also associated with an increased risk of side effects.&lt;ref name=Ve2014&gt;{{cite journal |last=Veale |first= D|last2= Miles|first2=S |last3=Smallcombe |first3= N|last4=Ghezai |first4=H |last5=Goldacre |first5=B|last6=Hodsoll |first6=J |date=29 November 2014 |title=Atypical antipsychotic augmentation in SSRI treatment refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis. |journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume= 14|issue= |pages=317 |doi=10.1186/s12888-014-0317-5 |pmid=25432131 |pmc=4262998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dec2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Decloedt EH, Stein DJ | title = Current trends in drug treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat | volume = 6 | issue = |pages = 233–42 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20520787 | pmc = 2877605 | doi = 10.2147/NDT.S3149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without treatment, the condition often lasts decades.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

OCD can present with a wide variety of symptoms. Certain groups of symptoms usually occur together. These groups are sometimes viewed as dimensions or clusters that may reflect an underlying process. The standard assessment tool for OCD, the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS), has 13 predefined categories of symptoms. These symptoms fit into three to five groupings.&lt;ref name="Leckman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leckman|first1=JF|last2=Bloch|first2=MH|last3=King|first3=RA|title=Symptom dimensions and subtypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a developmental perspective.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2009|volume=11|issue=1|pages=21–33|pmid=19432385|pmc=3181902}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[meta analysis|meta analytic]] review of symptom structures found a four factor structure (grouping) to be most reliable.  The observed groups included a "symmetry factor", a "forbidden thoughts factor", a "cleaning factor", and a "hoarding factor".  The "symmetry factor" correlated highly with obsessions related to ordering, counting, and symmetry, as well as repeating compulsions.  The "forbidden thoughts factor" correlated highly with intrusive and distressing thoughts of a violent, religious, or sexual nature. The "cleaning factor" correlated highly with obsessions about contamination and compulsions related to cleaning. The "hoarding factor" only involved hoarding related obsessions and compulsions, and was identified as being distinct from other symptom groupings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bloch|first1=MH|last2=Landeros-Weisenberger|first2=A|last3=Rosario|first3=MC|last4=Pittenger|first4=C|last5=Leckman|first5=JF|title=Meta-analysis of the symptom structure of obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=[[The American Journal of Psychiatry]]|date=December 2008|volume=165|issue=12|pages=1532–42|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2008.08020320|pmid=18923068|pmc=3972003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While OCD has been considered a homogenous disorder from a neuropsychological perspective, many of the putative neuropsychological deficits may be due to comorbid disorders.  Furthermore, some subtypes have been associated with improvement in performance on certain tasks such as pattern recognition (washing subtype) and spatial working memory (obsessive thought subtype). Subgroups have also been distinguished by neuroimaging findings and treatment response.  Neuroimaging studies on this have been too few, and the subtypes examined have differed too much to draw any conclusions.  On the other hand, subtype dependent treatment response has been studied, and the hoarding subtype has consistently responded least to treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKay|first1=D|last2=Abramowitz|first2=JS|last3=Calamari|first3=JE|last4=Kyrios|first4=M|last5=Radomsky|first5=A|last6=Sookman|first6=D|last7=Taylor|first7=S|last8=Wilhelm|first8=S|title=A critical evaluation of obsessive-compulsive disorder subtypes: symptoms versus mechanisms.|journal=[[Clinical Psychology Review]]|date=July 2004|volume=24|issue=3|pages=283–313|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2004.04.003|pmid=15245833}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obsessions ===

[[File:Hortus Deliciarum - Hell.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|People with OCD may face intrusive thoughts, such as thoughts about the Devil (shown is a painted interpretation of Hell)]]

Obsessions are thoughts that recur and persist, despite efforts to ignore or confront them.&lt;ref name=Review10&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Y|last1=Markarian|first2=MJ|last2=Larson|first3=MA|last3=Aldea|first4=SA|last4=Baldwin|first5=D|last5=Good|first6=A|last6=Berkeljon|first7=TK|last7=Murphy|first8=EA|last8=Storch|first9=D|last9=McKay| title = Multiple pathways to functional impairment in obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = [[Clinical Psychology Review]] |volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 78–88 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 19853982 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2009.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with OCD frequently perform tasks, or [[Compulsive behavior|compulsions]], to seek relief from obsession-related anxiety. Within and among individuals, the initial obsessions, or intrusive thoughts, vary in their clarity and vividness. A relatively vague obsession could involve a general sense of disarray or tension accompanied by a belief that life cannot proceed as normal while the imbalance remains. A more intense obsession could be a preoccupation with the thought or image of someone close to them dying{{sfn|Baer|2001|pp=33, 78}}{{sfn|Baer|2001|p=xiv}} or intrusions related to "[[Relationship obsessive–compulsive disorder|relationship rightness]]".&lt;ref name = Doron2013&gt;{{cite journal |first1=G|last1=Doron|first2=O|last2=Szepsenwol|first3=E|last3=Karp|first4=N|last4=Gal| title = Obsessing About Intimate-Relationships: Testing the Double Relationship-Vulnerability Hypothesis | journal = [[Journal of Behavior Therapy and Experimental Psychiatry]] |volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 433–440 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23792752 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbtep.2013.05.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other obsessions concern the possibility that someone or something other than oneself—such as God, the Devil, or disease—will harm either the person with OCD or the people or things that the person cares about. Other individuals with OCD may experience the sensation of invisible protrusions emanating from their bodies, or have the feeling that inanimate objects are ensouled.&lt;ref name=Mash&gt;{{cite book|first1=Eric J.|last1=Mash|first2=David A.|last2=Wolfe|title=Abnormal child psychology|edition=3|date=2005|publisher=[[The Thomson Corporation|Thomson Wadsworth]]|location=[[Belmont, California]]|page=197|isbn= 978-1305105423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people with OCD experience [[sexual obsessions]] that may involve intrusive thoughts or images of "kissing, touching, fondling, [[oral sex]], [[anal sex]], intercourse, [[incest]], and [[rape]]" with "strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals, and religious figures", and can include "[[heterosexual]] or [[homosexual]] content" with persons of any age.&lt;ref name="Osgood"&gt;{{cite web|first=Deborah|last=Osgood-Hynes|url=http://www.raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf|title=Thinking Bad Thoughts|publisher=MGH/McLean OCD Institute|location=Belmont, Massachusetts|accessdate=December 30, 2006|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115230001/http://raminader.com/PDFs%20Uploaded/OCD%20-%20Thinking%20Bad%20Thoughts.pdf |archive-date=November 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with other intrusive, unpleasant thoughts or images, some disquieting sexual thoughts at times are normal, but people with OCD may attach extraordinary significance to the thoughts. For example, obsessive fears about [[sexual orientation]] can appear to the person with OCD, and even to those around them, as a crisis of [[sexual identity]].&lt;ref name="ItMoved"&gt;{{cite web|first=Steven|last=Phillipson|url=http://www.ocdonline.com/articlephillipson7.php|title=I Think It Moved|website=OCDOnline.com|publisher=Center for Cognitive-Behavioral Psychotherapy|location=New York City|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218215734/http://www.ocdonline.com/articlephillipson7.php |archive-date=December 18, 2008|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sexfears"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mark-Ameen|last=Johnson|url=http://www.brainphysics.com/yourenotgay.php|title=I'm Gay and You're Not : Understanding Homosexuality Fears|website=brainphysics.com|dead-url=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505042912/http://www.brainphysics.com/yourenotgay.php |archive-date=5 May 2009|accessdate=14 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the troubling thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or self-loathing.&lt;ref name="Osgood" /&gt;

Most people with OCD understand that their notions do not correspond with reality; however, they feel that they must act as though their notions are correct. For example, an individual who engages in [[compulsive hoarding]] might be inclined to treat inorganic matter as if it had the sentience or rights of living organisms, while accepting that such behavior is irrational on a more intellectual level. There is a debate as to whether or not hoarding should be considered with other OCD symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=DL|last2=Timpano|first2=KR|last3=Wheaton|first3=MG|last4=Greenberg|first4=BD|last5=Miguel|first5=EC|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder and its related disorders: a reappraisal of obsessive-compulsive spectrum concepts.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2010|volume=12|issue=2|pages=131–48|pmid=20623919|pmc=3181955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCD sometimes manifests without overt compulsions, referred to as Primarily Obsessional OCD. OCD without overt compulsions could, by one estimate, characterize as many as 50 percent to 60 percent of OCD cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Myrna M.|last1=Weisman|title = The cross national epidemiology of obsessive–compulsive disorder | journal = New Developments in Obsessive-Compulsive and Spectrum Disorders|  volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 6–9 |date = May 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compulsions ===
{{Main|Compulsive behavior}}

[[File:Derma me.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Dermatillomania|Skin-picking disorder]]]]

Some people with OCD perform compulsive rituals because they inexplicably feel they have to, while others act compulsively so as to mitigate the anxiety that stems from particular obsessive thoughts. The person might feel that these actions somehow either will prevent a dreaded event from occurring or will push the event from their thoughts. In any case, the individual's reasoning is so [[idiosyncratic]] or distorted that it results in significant distress for the individual with OCD or for those around them. Excessive [[excoriation disorder|skin picking]], [[trichotillomania|hair-pulling]], [[nail biting]], and other body-focused repetitive behavior disorders are all on the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]].&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Some individuals with OCD are aware that their behaviors are not rational, but feel compelled to follow through with them to fend off feelings of panic or dread.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Highlights of Changes from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5|url=http://www.dsm5.org/documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|page=7|year=2013|accessdate=12 Apr 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019204551/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/changes%20from%20dsm-iv-tr%20to%20dsm-5.pdf|archivedate=19 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common compulsions include hand washing, cleaning, checking things (e.g., locks on doors), repeating actions (e.g., turning on and off switches), ordering items in a certain way, and requesting reassurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Boyd MA |title=Psychiatric Nursing |journal=Issues in Mental Health Nursing |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=13–26 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3UUuXw7ISM0C&amp;pg=PA418|isbn=978-0-397-55178-1|pmid=8119793 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsions are different from [[tics]] (such as touching, tapping, rubbing, or blinking)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Storch|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder in youth with and without a chronic tic disorder|url=http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/17345600|journal=Depression and Anxiety|year=2008|volume=25|issue=9|pages=761–767|doi=10.1002/da.20304|pmid=17345600|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[stereotypic movement disorder|stereotyped movements]] (such as head banging, body rocking, or self-biting), which usually aren't as complex and aren't precipitated by obsessions.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between compulsions and complex tics.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; About 10% to 40% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Conelea|year=2014|title=Tic-related obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD): phenomenology and treatment outcome in the Pediatric OCD Treatment Study II|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Child &amp; Adolescent Psychiatry|volume=53|issue=12|pages=1308–16|doi=10.1016/j.jaac.2014.09.014|pmid=25457929|display-authors=etal|pmc=4254546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People rely on compulsions as an escape from their obsessive thoughts; however, they are aware that the relief is only temporary, that the intrusive thoughts will soon return. Some people use compulsions to avoid situations that may trigger their obsessions. Although some people do certain things over and over again, they do not necessarily perform these actions compulsively. For example, bedtime routines, learning a new skill, and religious practices are not compulsions. Whether or not behaviors are compulsions or mere habit depends on the context in which the behaviors are performed. For example, arranging and ordering DVDs for eight hours a day would be expected of one who works in a video store, but would seem abnormal in other situations. In other words, habits tend to bring efficiency to one's life, while compulsions tend to disrupt it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide/obsessive-compulsive-disorder.|title=Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, (2005) |accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the anxiety and fear that typically accompanies OCD, sufferers may spend hours performing such compulsions every day. In such situations, it can be hard for the person to fulfil their work, family, or social roles. In some cases, these behaviors can also cause adverse physical symptoms. For example, people who obsessively wash their hands with [[antibacterial soap]] and hot water can make their skin red and raw with [[dermatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |title=Hygiene of the Skin: When Is Clean Too Clean? Subtopic: "Skin Barrier Properties and Effect of Hand Hygiene Practices", Paragraph 5. |accessdate=26 March 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421205614/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol7no2/larson.htm |archivedate=21 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with OCD can use rationalizations to explain their behavior; however, these rationalizations do not apply to the overall behavior but to each instance individually. For example, a person compulsively checking the front door may argue that the time taken and stress caused by one more check of the front door is much less than the time and stress associated with being robbed, and thus checking is the better option. In practice, after that check, the person is ''still'' not sure and deems it is ''still'' better to perform one more check, and this reasoning can continue as long as necessary.

=== Insight ===
The DSM-V contains three specifiers for the level of insight in OCD.  Good or fair insight is characterized by the acknowledgment that obsessive-compulsive beliefs are or may not be true.  Poor insight is characterized by the belief that obsessive-complsive beliefs are probably true.  Absence of insight make obsessive-compulsive beliefs [[delusion]]al thoughts, and occurs in about 4% of people with OCD.&lt;ref name="Sadock"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruiz|first1=P|last2=Sadock|first2=B|last3=Sadock|first3=V|title=Kaplan and Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry|publisher=LWW|location=95218|isbn=978-1-4511-0047-1|edition=10th|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overvalued ideas ===
Some people with OCD exhibit what is known as ''overvalued ideas''. In such cases, the person with OCD will truly be uncertain whether the fears that cause them to perform their compulsions are irrational or not. After some discussion, it is possible to convince the individual that their fears may be unfounded. It may be more difficult to do [[Exposure and response prevention|ERP therapy]] on such people because they may be unwilling to cooperate, at least initially. There are severe cases in which the person has an unshakeable belief in the context of OCD that is difficult to differentiate from [[psychosis|psychotic disorders]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Dwyer, Anne-Marie Carter, Obsessive–compulsive disorder and delusions revisited, The British Journal of Psychiatry (2000) 176: 281–284&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cognitive performance ===
A 2013 meta-analysis reported that people with OCD to have mild but wide-ranging cognitive deficits; significantly regarding [[spatial memory]], to a lesser extent with [[verbal memory]], [[Verbal fluency test|fluency]], executive function, and processing speed, while auditory attention was not significantly affected.&lt;ref name=shin&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shin NY, Lee TY, Kim E, Kwon JS | title = Cognitive functioning in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Medicine | pages = 1–10 | date = 19 July 2013 | pmid = 23866289 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291713001803 | volume=44| issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People with OCD show impairment in formulating an organizational strategy for coding information, set-shifting, and motor and cognitive inhibition.&lt;ref name="Aydin"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Çetinay Aydın P, Güleç Öyekçin D | title = Cognitive functions in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder | journal = Turk Psikiyatri Dergisi (Turkish Journal of Psychiatry) | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 266–74 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24310094 | doi=10.5080/u7172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific subtypes of symptom dimensions in OCD have been associated with specific cognitive deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pauls|first1=DL|last2=Abramovitch|first2=A|last3=Rauch|first3=SL|last4=Geller|first4=DA|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder: an integrative genetic and neurobiological perspective.|journal=Nature Reviews.

== Causes ==
{{Main|Cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder}}
The cause is unknown.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt; Both environmental and genetic factors are believed to play a role. Risk factors include a history of [[child abuse]] or other [[stress (psychological)|stress]]-inducing event.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt;

=== Genetics ===
There appear to be some [[genetics|genetic]] components with [[identical twins]] more often affected than non-identical twins.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Further, individuals with OCD are more likely to have first-degree family members exhibiting the same disorders than do matched controls. In cases where OCD develops during childhood, there is a much stronger familial link in the disorder than cases in which OCD develops later in adulthood. In general, genetic factors account for 45–65% of the variability in OCD symptoms in children diagnosed with the disorder.&lt;ref name="pmid19665647"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Abramowitz JS, Taylor S, McKay D | title = Obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Lancet | volume = 374 | issue = 9688 | pages = 491–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19665647 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60240-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study found evidence supporting the possibility of a heritable risk for OCD.&lt;ref name="Menzies et al, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | authors = Menzies L, Achard S, Chamberlain SR, Fineberg N, Chen CH, del Campo N, Sahakian BJ, Robbins TW, Bullmore E | title = Neurocognitive endophenotypes of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Brain | volume = 130 | issue = Pt 12 | pages = 3223–36 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17855376 | doi = 10.1093/brain/awm205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been postulated by [[Evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]] that moderate versions of compulsive behavior may have had evolutionary advantages.

=== Neuroimaging ===
[[File:OCD - Obsessive–compulsive disorder.jpg|thumb|Some parts of the brain showing abnormal activity in OCD.]]
Functional neuroimaging during symptom provocation has observed abnormal activity in the [[orbitofrontal cortex]], left [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]], right [[premotor cortex]], left superior [[Superior temporal gyrus|temporal gyrus]], [[globus pallidus externus]], [[hippocampus]] and right [[uncus]]. Weaker foci of abnormal activity were found in the left [[caudate nucleus|caudate]], [[posterior cingulate cortex]] and [[superior parietal lobule]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rotge|first1=Jean-Yves|last2=Guehl|first2=Dominique|last3=Dilharreguy|first3=Bixente|last4=Cuny|first4=Emmanuel|last5=Tignol|first5=Jean|last6=Bioulac|first6=Bernard|last7=Allard|first7=Michele|last8=Burbaud|first8=Pierre|last9=Aouizerate|first9=Bruno|title=Provocation of obsessive–compulsive symptoms: a quantitative voxel-based meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies|journal=Journal of Psychiatry &amp; Neuroscience : JPN|date=3 March 2017|volume=33|issue=5|pages=405–412|pmc=2527721|issn=1180-4882|pmid=18787662}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an older meta analysis of functional neuroimaging in OCD reported the only consistent functional neuroimaging findings have been increased activity in the orbital gyrus and head of the caudate nucleus, while ACC activation abnormalities were too inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whiteside|first1=Stephen P.|last2=Port|first2=John D.|last3=Abramowitz|first3=Jonathan S.|title=A meta–analysis of functional neuroimaging in obsessive–compulsive disorder|journal=Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging|volume=132|issue=1|pages=69–79|doi=10.1016/j.pscychresns.2004.07.001|pmid=15546704|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meta analysis comparing affective and non affective tasks observed differences with controls in regions implicated in salience, habit, goal ditected behavior, self-referential thinking and cognitive control.

=== Cognitive models ===

Generally two categories of models for OCD have been postulated, the first involving deficits in executive function, and the second involving deficits in modulatory control.  The first category of executive dysfunction is based on the observed structural and functional abnormalities in the dlPFC, striatum, and thalamus.  The second category involving dysfunctional modulatory control primarily relies on observed functional and structural differences in the ACC, mPFC and OFC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Friedlander|first1=L|last2=Desrocher|first2=M|title=Neuroimaging studies of obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults and children.|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=January 2006|volume=26|issue=1|pages=32–49|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2005.06.010|pmid=16242823}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stern|first1=ER|last2=Taylor|first2=SF|title=Cognitive neuroscience of obsessive-compulsive disorder.|journal=The Psychiatric Clinics of North America|date=September 2014|volume=37|issue=3|pages=337–52|doi=10.1016/j.psc.2014.05.004|pmid=25150566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One proposed model suggests that dysfunction in the [[orbitofrontal cortex|OFC]] leads to improper valuation of behaviors and decreased behavioral control, while the observed alterations in amygdala activations leads to exaggerated fears and representations of negative stimuli.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=J|last2=Ahmari|first2=SE|title=A Framework for Understanding the Emerging Role of Corticolimbic-Ventral Striatal Networks in OCD-Associated Repetitive Behaviors.|journal=Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience|date=2015|volume=9|pages=171|doi=10.3389/fnsys.2015.00171|pmid=26733823|pmc=4681810}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the heterogeneity of OCD symptoms, studies differentiating between symptoms have been performed. Symptom specific neuroimaging abnormalities include the hyperactivity of caudate and ACC in checking rituals, while finding increased activity of cortical and cerebellar regions in contamination related symptoms. Neuroimaging differentiating between content of intrusive thoughts have found differences between aggressive as opposed to taboo thoughts, finding increased connectivity of the amygdala, ventral striatum, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex in aggressive symptoms, while observing increased connectivity between the ventral striatum and insula in sexual/religious intrusive thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakao|first1=Tomohiro|last2=Okada|first2=Kayo|last3=Kanba|first3=Shigenobu|title=Neurobiological model of obsessive-compulsive disorder: Evidence from recent neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings|journal=Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|date=August 2014|volume=68|issue=8|pages=587–605|doi=10.1111/pcn.12195|pmid=24762196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another model proposes that affective dysregulation links excessive reliance on habit based action selection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barahona-Corrêa|first1=JB|last2=Camacho|first2=M|last3=Castro-Rodrigues|first3=P|last4=Costa|first4=R|last5=Oliveira-Maia|first5=AJ|title=From Thought to Action: How the Interplay Between Neuroscience and Phenomenology Changed Our Understanding of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2015|volume=6|pages=1798|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01798|pmid=26635696|pmc=4655583}}&lt;/ref&gt; with compulsions.  This is supported by the observation that those with OCD demonstrate decreased activation of the [[ventral striatum]] when anticipating monetary  reward, as well as increase functional connectivity between the VS and the OFC.  Furthermore, those with OCD demonstrate reduced performance in pavlovian fear extinction tasks, hyper responsiveness in the amygdala to fearful stimuli, and hypo-resonsiveness in the amygdala when exposed to positively valanced stimuli.  Stimulation of the [[nucleus accumbens]] has also been observed to effectively alleviate both obsessions and compulsions, supporting the role of affective dysregulation in generating both.&lt;ref name="Wood" /&gt;

=== Neurobiological ===

From the observation of the efficacy of antidepressants in OCD, a serotonin hypothesis of OCD has been formulated. Studies of peripheral markers of serotonin, as well as challenges with proserotonergic compounds have yielded inconsistent results, including evidence pointing towards basal hyperactivity of serotonergic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Kenneth L|title=Neuropsychopharmacology : the fifth generation of progress : an official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology|date=2002|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|isbn=978-0-7817-2837-9|pages=1609–1610|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serotonin receptor and transporter binding studies have yielded conflicting results, including higher and lower serotonin receptor [[5-HT2A]] and [[serotonin transporter]] binding potentials that were normalized by treatment with SSRIs. Despite inconsistencies in the types of abnormalities found, evidence points towards dysfunction of serotonergic systems in OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Muller |first1=Christian P |last2=Jacobs |first2=Barry L |author3=A Dijk|author4=A Klompmakers|author5=D Denys|title=Handbook of the behavioral neurobiology of serotonin|date=2009|publisher=Academic|location=London|isbn=978-0-12-374634-4|pages=547–558|edition=1st|chapter=4.4 The Serotonergic System in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orbitofrontal cortex]] overactivity is attenuated in people who have successfully responded to [[SSRI]] medication, a result believed to be caused by increased stimulation of [[serotonin]] receptors [[5-HT2A receptor|5-HT2A]] and [[serotonin receptor|5-HT2C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim KW, Lee DY | title = Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Associated With a Left Orbitofrontal Infarct | journal = Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 88–89 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11884667 | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.14.1.88 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A complex relationship between dopamine and OCD has been observed. Although antipsychotics, which act by antagonizing dopamine receptors may improve some cases of OCD, they frequently exacerbate others.  Antipsychotics, in the low doses used to treat OCD, may actually increased the release of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, through inhibiting autoreceptors.

Abnormalities in glutaminergic neurotransmission have implicated in OCD.

== Diagnosis ==
Formal diagnosis may be performed by a psychologist, psychiatrist, clinical social worker, or other licensed mental health professional. To be diagnosed with OCD, a person must have obsessions, compulsions, or both, according to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM). The Quick Reference to the 2000 edition of the DSM states that several features characterize [[Clinical significance|clinically significant]] obsessions and compulsions. Such obsessions, the DSM says, are recurrent and persistent thoughts, [[impulse (psychology)|impulses]] or images that are experienced as intrusive and that cause marked anxiety or distress. These thoughts, impulses or images are of a degree or type that lies outside the [[Normality (behavior)|normal]] range of worries about conventional problems.&lt;ref name="Quick"&gt;''Quick Reference to the Diagnostic Criteria from DSM-IV-TR''. Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Association, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; A person may attempt to ignore or [[Thought suppression|suppress]] such obsessions, or to neutralize them with some other thought or action, and will tend to recognize the obsessions as idiosyncratic or irrational.

Compulsions become clinically significant when a person feels driven to perform them in response to an obsession, or according to rules that must be applied rigidly, and when the person consequently feels or causes significant distress. Therefore, while many people who do not suffer from OCD may perform actions often associated with OCD (such as ordering items in a pantry by height), the distinction with clinically significant OCD lies in the fact that the person who suffers from OCD ''must'' perform these actions, otherwise they will experience significant psychological distress. These behaviors or mental acts are aimed at preventing or reducing distress or preventing some dreaded event or situation; however, these activities are not logically or practically connected to the issue, or they are excessive. In addition, at some point during the course of the disorder, the individual must realize that their obsessions or compulsions are unreasonable or excessive.

Moreover, the obsessions or compulsions must be time-consuming (taking up more than one hour per day) or cause impairment in social, occupational or scholastic functioning.&lt;ref name="Quick" /&gt; It is helpful to quantify the severity of symptoms and impairment before and during treatment for OCD. In addition to the peron's estimate of the time spent each day harboring obsessive-compulsive thoughts or behaviors, concrete tools can be used to gauge the people’s condition. This may be done with rating scales, such as the [[Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale]] (Y-BOCS). With measurements like these, psychiatric consultation can be more appropriately determined because it has been standardized.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009" /&gt;

OCD is sometimes placed in a group of disorders called the [[obsessive–compulsive spectrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Starcevic|first1=V|last2=Janca|first2=A|title=Obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders: still in search of the concept-affirming boundaries.|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=January 2011|volume=24|issue=1|pages=55–60|pmid=20827198|doi=10.1097/yco.0b013e32833f3b58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differential diagnosis ===
OCD is often confused with the separate condition [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder]] (OCPD). OCD is [[egodystonic]], meaning that the disorder is incompatible with the sufferer's [[self-concept]].&lt;ref name="Aardema, F. 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Aardema&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aardema F., O'Connor |year = 2003 | title = Seeing white bears that are not there: Inference processes in obsessions | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Psychotherapy | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 23–37 | doi=10.1891/jcop.17.1.23.58270}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because ego dystonic disorders go against a person's self-concept, they tend to cause much distress. OCPD, on the other hand, is [[egosyntonic]]—marked by the person's acceptance that the characteristics and behaviours displayed as a result are compatible with their [[self-image]], or are otherwise appropriate, correct or reasonable.

As a result, people with OCD are often aware that their behavior is not rational, are unhappy about their obsessions but nevertheless feel compelled by them.&lt;ref name="carter"&gt;Carter, K. "Obsessive–compulsive personality disorder." PSYC 210 lecture: Oxford College of Emory University. Oxford, GA. 11 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast people with OCPD are not aware of anything abnormal; they will readily explain why their actions are rational, it is usually impossible to convince them otherwise, and they tend to derive pleasure from their obsessions or compulsions.&lt;ref name="carter" /&gt;

== Management ==
A form of psychotherapy called "[[cognitive behavioral therapy]]" (CBT) and [[psychotropic medication]]s are first-line treatments for OCD.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NICE2005 /&gt; Other forms of psychotherapy, such as [[psychodynamic]] and [[psychoanalysis]] may help in managing some aspects of the disorder, but in 2007 the [[American Psychiatric Association]] (APA) noted a lack of [[Scientific control|controlled studies]] showing their effectiveness "in dealing with the core symptoms of OCD".&lt;ref name="APAguidelines"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Koran LM, Hanna GL, Hollander E, Nestadt G, Simpson HB | title = Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 164 | issue = 7 Suppl | pages = 5–53 | date = July 2007 | pmid = 17849776 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that many individuals do not seek treatment may be due in part to [[social stigma|stigma]] associated with OCD.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

=== Therapy ===

[[File:Pennsylvania Capitol front door keyhole.jpg|thumb|One exposure and ritual prevention activity would be to check the lock only once, and then leave]]

The specific technique used in CBT is called [[exposure and response prevention]] (ERP) which involves teaching the person to deliberately come into contact with the situations that trigger the obsessive thoughts and fears ("exposure"), without carrying out the usual compulsive acts associated with the obsession ("response prevention"), thus gradually learning to tolerate the discomfort and anxiety associated with not performing the ritualistic behavior. At first, for example, someone might touch something only very mildly "contaminated" (such as a tissue that has been touched by another tissue that has been touched by the end of a toothpick that has touched a book that came from a "contaminated" location, such as a school.) That is the "exposure". The "ritual prevention" is not washing. Another example might be leaving the house and checking the lock only once (exposure) without going back and checking again (ritual prevention). The person fairly quickly [[habituation|habituates]] to the anxiety-producing situation and discovers that their anxiety level drops considerably; they can then progress to touching something more "contaminated" or not checking the lock at all—again, without performing the ritual behavior of washing or checking.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com"&gt;Huppert &amp; Roth: (2003) Treating Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder with Exposure and Response Prevention. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 4 (1),'' 66 – 70 [http://www.baojournal.com/ BAO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323025324/http://baojournal.com/ |date=23 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ERP has a strong evidence base, and it is considered the most effective treatment for OCD.&lt;ref name="baojournal.com" /&gt; However, this claim was doubted by some researchers in 2000 who criticized the quality of many studies.&lt;ref name="pmid10910778"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Klein DF | title = Flawed meta-analyses comparing psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 157 | issue = 8 | pages = 1204–11 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10910778 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.157.8.1204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has generally been accepted that psychotherapy, in combination with psychiatric medication, is more effective than either option alone.

=== Medication ===

[[File:Anafranil Japan.jpg|thumb|A blister pack of [[clomipramine]] under the brand name ''Anafranil'']]

The medications most frequently used are the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs).&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt; [[Clomipramine]], a medication belonging to the class of [[tricyclic antidepressant]]s, appears to work as well as SSRIs but has a higher rate of side effects.&lt;ref name=NEJM2014 /&gt;

SSRIs are a second line treatment of adult obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) with mild functional impairment and as first line treatment for those with moderate or severe impairment. In children, SSRIs can be considered as a second line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects.&lt;ref name=NICE2005&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg31/resources/treating-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-ocd-and-body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd-in-adults-children-and-young-people-194882077|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder: Core interventions in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder|author=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)|series=Information about NICE Clinical Guideline 31|publisher=UK National Health Service (NHS)|date=November 2005|accessdate=24 July 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170112001813/https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg31/resources/treating-obsessivecompulsive-disorder-ocd-and-body-dysmorphic-disorder-bdd-in-adults-children-and-young-people-194882077|archivedate=12 January 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSRIs are efficacious in the treatment of OCD; people treated with SSRIs are about twice as likely to respond to treatment as those treated with placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Arroll B, Elley CR, Fishman T, Goodyear-Smith FA, Kenealy T, Blashki G, Kerse N, Macgillivray S | title = Antidepressants versus placebo for depression in primary care | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = |issue = 3 | pages = CD007954 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19588448 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007954 | url = https://discovery.dundee.ac.uk/en/publications/85b92403-d474-4e5a-b606-65f7e0f86575|editor1-last = Arroll | editor1-first = Bruce }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825+ |title=Review Finds SSRIs Modestly Effective in Short-Term Treatment of OCD|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413110435/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825 |archivedate=13 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efficacy has been demonstrated both in short-term (6–24&amp;nbsp;weeks) treatment trials and in discontinuation trials with durations of 28–52&amp;nbsp;weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fineberg NA, Brown A, Reghunandanan S, Pampaloni I | title = Evidence-based pharmacotherapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 1173–91 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22226028 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145711001829 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019839s070,020990s032lbl.pdf |title=Sertraline prescribing information |accessdate=30 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616011817/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2009/019839s070%2C020990s032lbl.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apotex.com/us/en/products/downloads/pil/paxil_irtb_ins.pdf |title=Paroxetine prescribing information |accessdate=30 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219055046/https://www.apotex.com/us/en/products/downloads/pil/paxil_irtb_ins.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the National Institute of Clinical and Health Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommended [[antipsychotic]]s for OCD that does not improve with SSRI treatment.&lt;ref name="Ve2014" /&gt; For OCD there is tentative evidence for [[risperidone]] and insufficient evidence for [[olanzapine]].  [[Quetiapine]] is no better than placebo with regard to primary outcomes, but small effects were found in terms of YBOCS score.  The efficacy of quetiapine and olanzapine are limited by the insufficient number of studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Komossa|first=K|author2=Depping, AM|author3= Meyer, M|author4= Kissling, W|author5= Leucht, S|title=Second-generation antipsychotics for obsessive compulsive disorder.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=8 Dec 2010|issue=12|pages=CD008141|pmid=21154394|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008141.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review article found two studies that indicated that [[aripiprazole]] was "effective in the short-term" and found that "[t]here was a small effect-size for risperidone or anti-psychotics in general in the short-term"; however, the study authors found "no evidence for the effectiveness of quetiapine or olanzapine in comparison to placebo."&lt;ref name="Ve2014" /&gt; While quetiapine may be useful when used in addition to an SSRI in treatment-resistant OCD, these drugs are often poorly tolerated, and have metabolic side effects that limit their use. None of the atypical antipsychotics appear to be useful when used alone.&lt;ref name=Dec2010 /&gt; Another review reported that no evidence supports the use of first generation antipsychotics in OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pignon|first1=B|last2=Tezenas du Montcel|first2=C|last3=Carton|first3=L|last4=Pelissolo|first4=A|title=The Place of Antipsychotics in the Therapy of Anxiety Disorders and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders.|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|date=7 November 2017|volume=19|issue=12|pages=103|doi=10.1007/s11920-017-0847-x|pmid=29110139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A guideline by the APA suggested that [[dextroamphetamine]] may be considered by itself after more well supported treatments have been tried.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koran|first1=Lorrin|last2=Hanna|first2=Gregory|last3=Hollander|first3=Eric|last4=Nestadt|first4=Gerald|last5=Helen|first5=Simpson|title=Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|url=http://psychiatryonline.org/pb/assets/raw/sitewide/practice_guidelines/guidelines/ocd.pdf|website=American Psychiatric Association|publisher=American Psychiatric Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Procedures ===
[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) has been found to have effectiveness in some severe and refractory cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cybulska Eva M | year = 2006 | title = Obsessive Compulsive disorder, the brain and electroconvulsive therapy | url = | journal = British Journal of Hospital Medicine | volume = 67 | issue = 2| pages = 77–82 | doi=10.12968/hmed.2006.67.2.20466| pmid = 16498907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[psychosurgery|Surgery]] may be used as a last resort in people who do not improve with other treatments. In this procedure, a surgical [[lesion]] is made in an area of the brain (the [[cingulate cortex]]). In one study, 30% of participants benefitted significantly from this procedure.&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;Barlow, D. H. and V. M. Durand. ''Essentials of Abnormal Psychology''. California: Thomson Wadsworth, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deep-brain stimulation]] and [[vagus nerve stimulation]] are possible surgical options that do not require destruction of [[brain tissue]]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration approved deep-brain stimulation for the treatment of OCD under a humanitarian device exemption requiring that the procedure be performed only in a hospital with specialist qualifications to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barlas S |title=FDA Approves Pioneering Treatment for Obsessive- Compulsive Disorder |journal=Psychiatric Times |volume=26 |issue=4 |date=8 April 2009 |url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ocd/article/10168/1399208 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710101738/http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/ocd/article/10168/1399208 |archivedate=10 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, psychosurgery for OCD is a treatment of last resort and will not be performed until the person has failed several attempts at medication (at the full dosage) with augmentation, and many months of intensive [[cognitive–behavioral therapy]] with exposure and ritual/response prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainphysics.com/surgery.php Surgical Procedures for Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725094926/http://brainphysics.com/surgery.php |date=25 July 2008 }}, by M. Jahn and M. Williams, Ph.D,. BrainPhysics OCD Resource, Accessed 6 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in the United Kingdom, psychosurgery cannot be performed unless a course of treatment from a suitably qualified cognitive–behavioral therapist has been carried out.

=== Children ===
Therapeutic treatment may be effective in reducing ritual behaviors of OCD for children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=O'Donohue William |author2=Ferguson Kyle E | year = 2006 | title = Evidence-Based Practice in Psychology and Behavior Analysis | url = | journal = The Behavior Analyst Today | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 335–347 | doi=10.1037/h0100155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the treatment of adults with OCD, CBT stands as an effective and validated first line of treatment of OCD in children.&lt;ref name=Freeman2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freeman|first1=J|last2=Garcia|first2=A|last3=Frank|first3=H|last4=Benito|first4=K|last5=Conelea|first5=C|last6=Walther|first6=M|last7=Edmunds|first7=J|title=Evidence base update for psychosocial treatments for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder|journal=Journal of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology|date=2014|volume=43|issue=1|pages=7–26|pmid=23746138|doi=10.1080/15374416.2013.804386|pmc=3815743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Family involvement, in the form of behavioral observations and reports, is a key component to the success of such treatments.&lt;ref name="Rapoport, J. E. 1989"&gt;Rapoport, J. E. (1989). Obsessive-compulsive Disorder In Children &amp; Adolescents. Washington: American Psychiatric Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Parental interventions also provide positive reinforcement for a child who exhibits appropriate behaviors as alternatives to compulsive responses. In a recent meta-analysis of evidenced-based treatment of OCD in children, family-focused individual CBT was labeled as "probably efficacious", establishing it as one of the leading psychosocial treatments for youth with OCD.&lt;ref name=Freeman2014 /&gt; After one or two years of therapy, in which a child learns the nature of his or her obsession and acquires strategies for coping, that child may acquire a larger circle of friends, exhibit less shyness, and become less self-critical.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, P. L. (1973). Obsessive Children: A Sociopsychiatric Study. Philadelphia: Brunner / Mazel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the causes of OCD in younger age groups range from brain abnormalities to psychological preoccupations, life stress such as bullying and traumatic familial deaths may also contribute to childhood cases of OCD, and acknowledging these stressors can play a role in treating the disorder.&lt;ref name="pmid19378573"&gt;{{cite journal | author = D'Alessandro TM | title = Factors influencing the onset of childhood obsessive compulsive disorder | journal = Pediatr Nurs | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19378573 | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obsessive–compulsive disorder affects about 2.3% of people at some point in their life.&lt;ref name=Good2014 /&gt; Rates during a given year are about 1.2% and it occurs worldwide.&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; It is unusual for symptoms to begin after the age of thirty five and half of people develop problems before twenty.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM5 /&gt; Males and females are affected about equally.&lt;ref name=NIH2015 /&gt;

=== Associated conditions ===
People with OCD may be diagnosed with other conditions, as well as or instead of OCD, such as the aforementioned obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen YW, Dilsaver SC | title = Comorbidity for obsessive-compulsive disorder in bipolar and unipolar disorders | journal = Psychiatry Research | volume = 59 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 57–64 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8771221 | doi = 10.1016/0165-1781(95)02752-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[anorexia nervosa]], [[social anxiety disorder]], [[bulimia nervosa]], [[Tourette syndrome]], [[autism spectrum disorder]], [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]], [[dermatillomania]] (compulsive skin picking), [[body dysmorphic disorder]] and [[trichotillomania]] (hair pulling). More than 50 percent of people experience suicidal tendencies, and 15 percent have attempted suicide.&lt;ref name="Fenske_2009" /&gt; Depression, anxiety and prior suicide attempts increase the risk of future suicide attempts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Angelakis|first1=I|last2=Gooding|first2=P|last3=Tarrier|first3=N|last4=Panagioti|first4=M|title=Suicidality in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|date=July 2015|volume=39|pages=1–15|pmid=25875222|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2015.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals with OCD have also been found to be affected by [[delayed sleep phase syndrome]] at a substantially higher rate than the general public.&lt;ref name='Turner 2007'&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turner J, Drummond LM, Mukhopadhyay S, Ghodse H, White S, Pillay A, Fineberg NA | title = A prospective study of delayed sleep phase syndrome in patients with severe resistant obsessive–compulsive disorder | journal = World Psychiatry | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 108–111 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 18235868 | pmc = 2219909 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, severe OCD symptoms are consistently associated with greater sleep disturbance. Reduced total sleep time and sleep efficiency have been observed in people with OCD, with delayed sleep onset and offset and an increased prevalence of delayed sleep phase disorder.&lt;ref name="Paterson2013"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paterson JL, Reynolds AC, Ferguson SA, Dawson D | title = Sleep and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) | journal = Sleep Medicine Reviews | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 465–74 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23499210 | doi = 10.1016/j.smrv.2012.12.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorally, there is some research demonstrating a link between [[drug addiction]] and the disorder as well. For example, there is a higher risk of drug addiction among those with any anxiety disorder (possibly as a way of [[Coping (psychology)|coping]] with the heightened levels of [[anxiety]]), but drug addiction among people with OCD may serve as a type of [[compulsive behavior]] and not just as a coping mechanism. [[Clinical depression|Depression]] is also extremely prevalent among people with OCD. One explanation for the high depression rate among OCD populations was posited by Mineka, Watson and Clark (1998), who explained that people with OCD (or any other [[anxiety disorder]]) may feel depressed because of an "out of control" type of feeling.&lt;ref name="comorbidity"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mineka S, Watson D, Clark LA | title = Comorbidity of anxiety and unipolar mood disorders | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = |pages = 377–412 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9496627 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.psych.49.1.377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Someone exhibiting OCD signs does not necessarily have OCD. Behaviors that present as (or seem to be) obsessive or compulsive can also be found in a number of other conditions as well, including [[obsessive–compulsive personality disorder|obsessive–compulsive ''personality'' disorder]] (OCPD), [[Conditions comorbid to autism spectrum disorders#Obsessive-compulsive disorder|autism spectrum disorder]], disorders where [[perseveration]] is a possible feature ([[ADHD]], [[PTSD]], bodily disorders or habit problems)&lt;ref name="differential"&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Differential Diagnoses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917123925/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential |date=17 September 2012 }} – 2012&lt;/ref&gt; or sub-clinically.

Some with OCD present with features typically associated with Tourette's syndrome, such as compulsions that may appear to resemble motor tics; this has been termed "tic-related OCD" or "Tourettic OCD".&lt;ref name="10.1176/appi.neuropsych.21.1.59"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mansueto CS, Keuler DJ | title = Tic or compulsion?: it's Tourettic OCD. | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 784–99 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16046664 | doi = 10.1177/0145445505279261 | journal=Behavior Modification}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD and T"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocfoundation.org/eo_ts.aspx |title=OCD and Tourette Syndrome: Re-examining the Relationship |publisher=International OCD Foundation |accessdate=30 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101085624/http://www.ocfoundation.org/eo_ts.aspx |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A myth propagated by Sigmund Freud regarding above-average intelligence in OCD was recently refuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s11065-017-9358-0 | pmid=28864868 | title=Meta-Analysis of Intelligence Quotient (IQ) in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder | year=2017 | journal=Neuropsychology Review | volume=28 | issue=1 | pages=111–120 | author=Abramovitch Amitai, Anholt Gideon, Raveh-Gottfried Sagi, Hamo Naama, Abramowitz Jonathan S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OCD frequently co-occurs with both [[bipolar disorder]] and [[major depressive disorder]].  Between 60–80% of those with OCD experience a major depressive episode in their lifetime. Comorbidity rates have been reported at between 19–90% due to methodological differences.  Between 9–35% of those with bipolar disorder also have OCD, compared to the 1–2% in the general population. Around 50% of those with OCD experience cyclothymic traits or hypomanic episodes.  OCD is also associated with anxiety disorders.  Lifetime comorbidity for OCD has been reported at 22% for [[specific phobia]], 18% for [[social anxiety disorder]], 12% for panic disorder, and 30% for [[generalized anxiety disorder]].  The comorbidity rate for OCD and ADHD has been reported as high as 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pallanti|first1=S|last2=Grassi|first2=G|last3=Sarrecchia|first3=ED|last4=Cantisani|first4=A|last5=Pellegrini|first5=M|title=Obsessive-compulsive disorder comorbidity: clinical assessment and therapeutic implications.|journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry|date=2011|volume=2|pages=70|doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2011.00070|pmid=22203806|pmc=3243905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
Quality of life is reduced across all domains in OCD. While psychological or pharmacological treatment can lead to a reduction of OCD symptoms and an increase in QoL, symptoms may persist at moderate levels even following adequate treatment courses, and completely symptom-free periods are uncommon.&lt;ref name="pmid15533282"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eddy KT, Dutra L, Bradley R, Westen D | title = A multidimensional meta-analysis of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 24 | issue = 8 | pages = 1011–30 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15533282 | doi = 10.1016/j.cpr.2004.08.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Subramaniam|first1=M|last2=Soh|first2=P|last3=Vaingankar|first3=JA|last4=Picco|first4=L|last5=Chong|first5=SA|title=Quality of life in obsessive-compulsive disorder: impact of the disorder and of treatment.|journal=CNS Drugs|date=May 2013|volume=27|issue=5|pages=367–83|doi=10.1007/s40263-013-0056-z|pmid=23580175}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In pediatric OCD, around 40% still have the disorder in adulthood, and around 40% qualify for remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boileau|first1=B|title=A review of obsessive-compulsive disorder in children and adolescents.|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|date=2011|volume=13|issue=4|pages=401–11|pmid=22275846|pmc=3263388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the seventh century AD, [[John Climacus]] records an instance of a young monk plagued by constant and overwhelming "temptations to blasphemy" consulting an older monk,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Osborn|first=Ian|date=1998|title=Tormenting Thoughts and Secret Rituals: The Hidden Epidemic of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WVgTAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA210&amp;dq=Obsessive+Compulsive+Disorder+in+antiquity#v=onepage&amp;q=Obsessive%20Compulsive%20Disorder%20in%20antiquity&amp;f=false|location=New York City, New York|publisher=Dell Publishing|isbn=978-0-440-50847-2|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|212}} who told him, "My son, I take upon myself all the sins which these temptations have led you, or may lead you, to commit. All I require of you is that for the future you pay no attention to them whatosever."&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|212}} ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'', a Christian mystical text from the late fourteenth century, recommends dealing with recurring obsessions by first attempting to ignore them,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} and, if that fails, "cower under them like a poor wretch and a coward overcome in battle, and reckon it to be a waste of your time for you to strive any longer against them",&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} a technique now known as "[[emotional flooding]]".&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}}

From the 14th to the 16th century in Europe, it was believed that people who experienced blasphemous, sexual or other obsessive thoughts were [[spiritual possession|possessed]] by the [[Satan|Devil]].&lt;ref name="Aardema, F. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aardema F., O'Connor |year = 2007 | title = The menace within: obsessions and the self | url = | journal = International Journal of Cognitive Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = 3| pages = 182–197 | doi=10.1891/088983907781494573}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|213}} Based on this reasoning, treatment involved banishing the "evil" from the "possessed" person through [[exorcism]].&lt;ref name="Jenike"&gt;M.

The English term obsessive-compulsive comes from the translated term used to describe the first conceptions of OCD by [[Carl Friedrich Otto Westphal|Carl Westphal]], "zwangsvorstellung".  Westphal's description went on to influence [[Pierre Janet]] who further documented features of OCD.&lt;ref name="Sadock" /&gt;  In the early 1910s, [[Sigmund Freud]] attributed obsessive–compulsive behavior to unconscious conflicts that manifest as symptoms.&lt;ref name="Jenike" /&gt; Freud describes the clinical history of a typical case of "touching phobia" as starting in early childhood, when the person has a strong desire to touch an item. In response, the person develops an "external prohibition" against this type of touching. However, this "prohibition does not succeed in abolishing" the desire to touch; all it can do is repress the desire and "force it into the unconscious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Freud S |authorlink=Sigmund Freud |others=trans.

=== Notable cases ===
[[John Bunyan]] (1628–1688), the author of ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', displayed symptoms of OCD (which had not yet been named).&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} During the most severe period of his condition, he would mutter the same phrase over and over again to himself while rocking back and forth.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} He later described his obsessions in his autobiography ''[[Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners]]'',&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|53–54}} stating, "These things may seem ridiculous to others, even as ridiculous as they were in themselves, but to me they were the most tormenting cogitations."&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|54}} He wrote two pamphlets advising those suffering from similar anxieties.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|217–218}} In one of them, he warns against indulging in compulsions:&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|217–218}} "Have care of putting off your trouble of spirit in the wrong way: by promising to reform yourself and lead a new life, by your performances or duties".&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|218}}

British poet, essayist and lexicographer [[Samuel Johnson]] (1709–1784) also suffered from OCD.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|54–55}} He had elaborate rituals for crossing the thresholds of doorways, and repeatedly walked up and down staircases counting the steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://westsuffolkpsych.homestead.com/Johnson.html |title=SAMUEL JOHNSON (1709–1784): A Patron Saint of OCD? by Fred Penzel, Ph.D. from the Scientific Advisory Board of the International OCD Foundation |website=Westsuffolkpsych.homestead.com |accessdate=29 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615085035/http://westsuffolkpsych.homestead.com/Johnson.html |archivedate=15 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} He would touch every post on the street as he walked past,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} only step in the middles of paving stones,&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} and repeatedly perform tasks as though they had not been done properly the first time.&lt;ref name="Osborn1998" /&gt;{{rp|55}} The American aviator and filmmaker [[Howard Hughes]] is known to have had OCD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes.aspx |title=Hughes's germ phobia revealed in psychological autopsy |last1=Dittmann |first1=M |date=July–August 2005 |website=American Psychological Association |accessdate=9 January 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150105071029/http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes.aspx |archivedate=5 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends of Hughes have also mentioned his obsession with minor flaws in clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug05/hughes.html | journal=APA Online: Monitor on Psychology | volume=36 | issue=7 | date=July–August 2005 | author1=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8795">In [[statistics]] and [[signal processing]], the '''orthogonality principle''' is a necessary and sufficient condition for the optimality of a [[Bayesian estimator]]. Loosely stated, the orthogonality principle says that the error vector of the optimal estimator (in a [[mean square error]] sense) is orthogonal to any possible estimator. The orthogonality principle is most commonly stated for linear estimators, but more general formulations are possible. Since the principle is a necessary and sufficient condition for optimality, it can be used to find the [[minimum mean square error]] estimator.

== Orthogonality principle for linear estimators ==

The orthogonality principle is most commonly used in the setting of linear estimation.&lt;ref&gt;Kay, p.386&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, let ''x'' be an unknown [[random vector]] which is to be estimated based on the observation vector ''y''. One wishes to construct a linear estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat{x} = Hy + c&lt;/math&gt; for some matrix ''H'' and vector ''c''. Then, the orthogonality principle states that an estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; achieves [[minimum mean square error]] if and only if
* &lt;math&gt;E \{ (\hat{x} - x ) y^T \} = 0,&lt;/math&gt; and
* &lt;math&gt;E \{ \hat{x} - x \} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
If ''x'' and ''y'' have zero mean, then it suffices to require the first condition.

Suppose ''x'' is a [[Gaussian random variable]] with mean ''m'' and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2.&lt;/math&gt; Also suppose we observe a value &lt;math&gt;y=x+w,&lt;/math&gt; where ''w'' is Gaussian noise which is independent of ''x'' and has mean 0 and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma_w^2.&lt;/math&gt; We wish to find a linear estimator &lt;math&gt;\hat{x} = hy+c&lt;/math&gt; minimizing the MSE. Substituting the expression &lt;math&gt;\hat{x} = hy + c&lt;/math&gt; into the two requirements of the orthogonality principle, we obtain
: &lt;math&gt;0 = E \{ (\hat{x} - x ) y \}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;0 = E \{ (hx+hw+c-x)(x+w) \}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;0 = h (\sigma_x^2+\sigma_w^2) + hm^2 + cm - \sigma_x^2 -m^2&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;0 = E \{ \hat{x} - x \}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;0 = E \{ hx+hw+c-x \}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;0 = (h-1)m + c .&lt;/math&gt;
Solving these two linear equations for ''h'' and ''c'' results in
: &lt;math&gt; h = \frac{\sigma_x^2}{\sigma_x^2 +\sigma_w^2}, \quad c = \frac{\sigma_w^2}{\sigma_x^2+\sigma_w^2} m , &lt;/math&gt;
so that the linear minimum mean square error estimator is given by
: &lt;math&gt; \hat{x} = \frac{\sigma_x^2}{\sigma_x^2 +\sigma_w^2} y + \frac{\sigma_w^2}{\sigma_x^2 +\sigma_w^2} m.&lt;/math&gt;

This estimator can be interpreted as a weighted average between the noisy measurements ''y'' and the prior expected value ''m''. If the noise variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma_w^2&lt;/math&gt; is low compared with the variance of the prior  &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2&lt;/math&gt; (corresponding to a high [[signal to noise ratio|SNR]]), then most of the weight is given to the measurements ''y'', which are deemed more reliable than the prior information. Conversely, if the noise variance is relatively higher, then the estimate will be close to ''m'', as the measurements are not reliable enough to outweigh the prior information.

Finally, note that because the variables ''x'' and ''y'' are jointly Gaussian, the minimum MSE estimator is linear.&lt;ref&gt;See the article [[minimum mean square error]].&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in this case, the estimator above minimizes the MSE among all estimators, not only linear estimators.

== General formulation ==
Let &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Hilbert space]] of random variables with an [[inner product]] defined by &lt;math&gt;\langle x,y \rangle = E \{ x^H y \}&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a [[closed set|closed]] subspace of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, representing the space of all possible estimators. One wishes to find a vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{x} \in W&lt;/math&gt; which will approximate a vector &lt;math&gt;x \in V&lt;/math&gt;. More accurately, one would like to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) &lt;math&gt;E \| x - \hat{x} \|^2&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

In the special case of linear estimators described above, the space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all functions of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, while &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is the set of linear estimators, i.e., linear functions of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; only. Other settings which can be formulated in this way include the subspace of [[causal filter|causal]] linear filters and the subspace of all (possibly nonlinear) estimators.

Geometrically, we can see this problem by the following simple case where &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; is a [[dimension (vector space)|one-dimensional]] subspace:

[[Image:Orthogonality principle.png|350px|center]]

We want to find the closest approximation to the vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by a vector &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt; in the space &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;. From the geometric interpretation, it is intuitive that the best approximation, or smallest error, occurs when the error vector, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, is orthogonal to vectors in the space &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt;. 

More accurately, the general orthogonality principle states the following: Given a closed subspace &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; of estimators within a Hilbert space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and an element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, an element &lt;math&gt;\hat{x} \in W&lt;/math&gt; achieves minimum MSE among all elements in &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;E \{ (x-\hat{x}) y^T \} = 0 &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;y \in W.&lt;/math&gt;

Stated in such a manner, this principle is simply a statement of the [[Hilbert projection theorem]]. Nevertheless, the extensive use of this result in signal processing has resulted in the name "orthogonality principle."

== A solution to error minimization problems ==

The following is one way to find the [[minimum mean square error]] estimator by using the orthogonality principle.

We want to be able to approximate a vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by 

: &lt;math&gt;x=\hat{x}+e\,&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}=\sum_i c_{i}p_{i}&lt;/math&gt;

is the approximation of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as a linear combination of vectors in the subspace &lt;math&gt;W&lt;/math&gt; spanned by &lt;math&gt;p_{1},p_{2},\ldots.&lt;/math&gt; Therefore, we want to be able to solve for the coefficients, &lt;math&gt;c_{i}&lt;/math&gt;, so that we may write our approximation in known terms.

By the orthogonality theorem, the square norm of the error vector, &lt;math&gt;\left\Vert e\right\Vert ^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, is minimized when, for all ''j'',

: &lt;math&gt;\left\langle x-\sum_i c_{i}p_{i},p_{j}\right\rangle =0.&lt;/math&gt;

Developing this equation, we obtain

: &lt;math&gt;
\left\langle x,p_{j}\right\rangle =\left\langle \sum_i c_{i}p_{i},p_{j}\right\rangle =\sum_i c_{i}\left\langle p_{i},p_{j}\right\rangle.&lt;/math&gt; 

If there is a finite number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of vectors &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;, one can write this equation in matrix form as

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\left\langle x,p_{1}\right\rangle \\
\left\langle x,p_{2}\right\rangle \\
\vdots\\
\left\langle x,p_{n}\right\rangle \end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\left\langle p_{1},p_{1}\right\rangle  &amp; \left\langle p_{2},p_{1}\right\rangle  &amp; \cdots &amp; \left\langle p_{n},p_{1}\right\rangle \\
\left\langle p_{1},p_{2}\right\rangle  &amp; \left\langle p_{2},p_{2}\right\rangle  &amp; \cdots &amp; \left\langle p_{n},p_{2}\right\rangle \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
\left\langle p_{1},p_{n}\right\rangle  &amp; \left\langle p_{2},p_{n}\right\rangle  &amp; \cdots &amp; \left\langle p_{n},p_{n}\right\rangle \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
c_{1}\\
c_{2}\\
\vdots\\
c_{n}\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming the &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[linearly independent]], the [[Gramian matrix]] can be inverted to obtain

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
c_{1}\\
c_{2}\\
\vdots\\
c_{n}\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\left\langle p_{1},p_{1}\right\rangle  &amp; \left\langle p_{2},p_{1}\right\rangle  &amp; \cdots &amp; \left\langle p_{n},p_{1}\right\rangle \\
\left\langle p_{1},p_{2}\right\rangle  &amp; \left\langle p_{2},p_{2}\right\rangle  &amp; \cdots &amp; \left\langle p_{n},p_{2}\right\rangle \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots\\
\left\langle p_{1},p_{n}\right\rangle  &amp; \left\langle p_{2},p_{n}\right\rangle  &amp; \cdots &amp; \left\langle p_{n},p_{n}\right\rangle \end{bmatrix}^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
\left\langle x,p_{1}\right\rangle \\
\left\langle x,p_{2}\right\rangle \\
\vdots\\
\left\langle x,p_{n}\right\rangle \end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;

thus providing an expression for the coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; of the minimum mean square error estimator.

== Biography ==

=== Background and youth ===
The scion of an old Geneva family whose ancestor Jacques Mottu had moved to Geneva towards 1597,&lt;ref&gt;From Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse en ligne, version of 15 January 2009. Article on the Mottu family, by Henry Mottu&lt;/ref&gt; Philippe Mottu is the son of the pastor Henri Mottu, moderator of the « vénérable Compagnie des Pasteurs de Genève », and of Marthe Mottu, née Reverdin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gen-gen.ch/MOTTU/Philippe+Alexandre/99263 Philippe Mottu's record on the Geneva Genealogy site]&lt;/ref&gt;
A graduate of the Political Science school of the Geneva University, he started his professional life in a bank. In 1933 he underwent a deep spiritual experience&lt;ref name = reg308&gt;Philippe Mottu, ''Regards sur le Siècle'', Éditions L’Âge d’Homme, Lausanne, 1996, 319 pages, {{ISBN|2825107867}}, p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; which led him to undertake theology studies in [[Lausanne]]. There, his Latin professor, Jules Rochat, put him in touch with the [[Oxford Group]], soon to become [[Moral Rearmament]] (and currently [[Initiatives of Change]]). He was immediately won by the ideas and practice of the Oxford Group.

=== Moral Rearmament ===
[[File:13-mottus---buchman2.jpg|thumb|Philippe Mottu and his wife Hélène accompanying [[Frank Buchman]] in [[Caux-Palace|Caux]] in the early 1950s]]
In 1935, Philippe Mottu meets for the first time [[Frank Buchman]], the Oxford Group's founder who visits Geneva with a team in order to talk to [[League of Nations]] delegates. It is the beginning of a lifelong friendship, with its ups and downs, through which the two men will exchange abundant correspondence.&lt;ref name = ACV&gt;[http://www.davel.vd.ch/detail.aspx?ID=567276 Biography on the Vaud cantonal Archives’ site.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1938, as European nations re-armed for war, Buchman called for 'moral and spiritual re-armament' as the way to build a 'hate-free, fear-free, greed-free world'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iofc.org/history History page the Initiatives of Change's website.]&lt;/ref&gt; Enthusiastic, Philippe Mottu became one of the main activists of Moral Reamament (MRA) in Switzerland. In this capacity he participated in numerous MRA actions at home and abroad, particularly the massive meeting of Palais Baulieu in Lausanne in 1937 (10’000 participants) or the international meeting of Interlaken in 1938.

In 1939 Philippe Mottu was called into active service and joined the "Army and Home" section at the Swiss Army's headquarters, probably at [[Henri Guisan|General Guisan]]'s request as the general partly relied on MRA to build up Swiss morale and resistance spirit.&lt;ref name=FB&gt;Frédéric Burnand, "Le Réarmement moral, un fil rouge dans l’histoire suisse", [http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/changemaker_how-an-american-idea-influenced-swiss-morality/42259232 article on ''[[Swissinfo]]'' site on 29 June 2016].&lt;/ref&gt;
With [[Denis de Rougemont]] and [[Theophil Spoerri]], he took an active part in the setting up of the [[Gotthard League]], a civil society movement dedicated to countering "[[defeatism]] and deceptive [[propaganda]]" in the face of intense Nazi propaganda which Switzerland was subject to at the time. "We wanted to proclaim that our country would remain faithful to his multi-secular democratic tradition", he explained.&lt;ref name="ObIC"&gt;{{fr}}Andrew Stallybrass, Obituary of Philippe Mottu on Initiatives of Change site [http://fr.iofc.org/node/197]&lt;/ref&gt;

He then joined the [[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]] in [[Bern]].

=== The war years ===
In 1940, Philippe Mottu established contact with a German diplomat in Bern, Herbert Blankenhorn, and, through him, with [[Adam von Trott zu Solz]], one of the leaders of [[German resistance to Nazism]]. Upon von Trott's invitation, Mottu travelled to Berlin in November 1942 where he meets with other members of the resistance. During a British bombardment, a top German Foreign Affairs official, Hans-Bernd von Haften, asked him: "As Christians, are we allowed to kill Hitler?&lt;ref name="ObIC"/&gt;"

Supported by the Swiss foreign minister, [[Marcel Pilet-Golaz]], Philippe Mottu continued his contacts with von Trott and offered to act as a liaison person between the allied powers and the German Resistance by travelling himself to the United States, even though it was difficult to travel outside Switzerland.  In April 1944, von Trott visited Switzerland where he was promised assistance to reach Lisbon, while [[Allen Dulles]], chief of the [[Office of Strategic Services|OSS]] in Switzerland, promised his assistance for a transatlantic trip. A few days after the joint US-British [[Normandy landings]] on 6 June 1944, Mottu was in Stuttgart with von Trott and his group of friends : their [[coup]] was imminent. Mottu left for Washington having memorised all the names of the new German government.

To his despair, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] and his advisors didn’t believe in the German resistance. Additionally on 20 July 1944, [[20 July plot|Operation Walkyrie]] failed. His worst fears became reality when, in the course of the following weeks and months, he got confirmation of the arrest and execution of all the main conspirators : von Trott, von Haften and hundreds of others...

=== Caux ===
Philippe Mottu had been deeply affected by his experience during WWII. In 1943 already, a recurring thought had come to him: "If Switzerland escapes the ravages of this war, its mission will be to create a venue where French and Germans will be able to reconcile and build peace. Caux is the place.&lt;ref name = PI/&gt;"

With the financial support of around 100 Swiss families, Philippe Mottu and one of his friends Robert Hahnloser bought the derelict [[Caux Palace Hotel]] in 1946. It was repaired and refurbished thanks to the efforts of the Swiss and international teams, and, between 1946 and 1950, it welcomed thousands of French and German participants, among whom [[Konrad Adenauer]] and [[Robert Schuman]], who will later rely on their exceptional mutual trust to launch the first steps of the European construction. The Caux summer conferences dedicated to peace and reconciliation are still taking place today.&lt;ref name=FB/&gt;

Philippe Mottu contributed to the governance of the Caux conference centre from 1946 to 1961 and from 1967 to 1973 as a member of the Caux Foundation council. He was the Foundation's first president, from 1946 to 1958.&lt;ref name = ACV/&gt; Later on, he increasingly turned to the writing of numerous political philosophy books.

== Family ==
On {{date|1 September 1939}}, Philippe Mottu married Hélène de Trey. They will have four children, and, on the date of Philippe Mottu's death, nine grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.&lt;ref name = FPD/&gt;

His younger brother Daniel Mottu&lt;ref&gt;Born on {{date|31 March 1923}} in [[Chêne-Bougeries]], he married Monique de Reynier on {{date|8 September 1967}}in [[Caux (Montreux)|Caux]], and died on {{date|2 Mayi 2002}} in Geneva.[http://m.gen-gen.ch/MOTTU/Daniel+Arnold/99361 Daniel Mottu's record on the Geneva genealogy website]&lt;/ref&gt; will be the Caux Foundation's president from 1977 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;A law graduate from Geneva University, he committed to working full-time for MRA, and lived for a long time in Latin America, mainly in Brazil from 1952 to 1964. He became a member of the council of the Caux Foundation in 1958, which he presided from 1977 to 1987. [http://www.davel.vd.ch/detail.aspx?ID=566902 Biographic note on Daniel Mottu on the [[Vaud]] Cantonal Archives site.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
Philippe Mottu wrote several books on international, political and social issues. Building on a vast culture and on a rigorous analysis of his time's trends, he for instance exposed the rise of intolerance and extremism in Judaism, Christianity and Islam;&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Mottu, ''Regards sur le Siècle'', Éditions L’Âge d’Homme, Lausanne, 1996, 319 pages, {{ISBN|2825107867}}, {{pp.|297-308}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he was searching in which way humanity would adapt to the momentous transformations of the 20th century, and develop a harmonious society in the future, expressing the hope is that humanity will find spiritual resources allowing it to envisage its future with « a measure of serenity".&lt;ref name = reg308/&gt;

== Legacy ==
As a thinker and as an activist, Philippe Mottu played a role in Swiss and European history, contributing to reinforce the spirit of resistance to fascism in Switzerland through the Gotthard League, to support German resistance to Hitler and on the European scene in triggering the setting up of the Caux conference Centre.

Pioneer of [[Moral Rearmament]] in Switzerland, he left to the next generations the [[Caux Palace Hotel|Caux conference centre]], of which he was the inspirator and one of the most instrumental administrators. He was also a daring entrepreneur who signed the purchase contract for Caux in 1946, together with Robert Hahnloser, risking his name without knowing whether the necessary funds would be found in order to meet the down payments deadline&lt;ref name = ACV/&gt;{{,}}.&lt;ref name="ObIC"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10631">'''Projective identification''' is a term introduced by [[Melanie Klein]] to describe the process whereby in a close relationship, as between mother and child, lovers, or therapist and patient, parts of the self may in unconscious [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] be thought of as being forced into the other person.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

While based on Freud's concept of [[psychological projection]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.melanie-klein-trust.org.uk/projective-identification Projective identification]&lt;/ref&gt; projective identification represents a step beyond. In [[R.D. Laing]]'s words, "The one person does not use the [[Other (philosophy)|other]] merely as a hook to hang projections on. He/she strives to find in the other, or to induce the other to become, the very embodiment of projection".&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (Penguin 1969) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; Feelings which can not be consciously accessed are [[defense mechanism|defensively]] projected into another person in order to evoke the thoughts or feelings projected.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jacobs, ''Psychodynamic Counselling in Action'' (London 2006), p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

Projective identification may be used as a type of defense, a means of communicating, a primitive form of relationship, or a route to psychological change;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jan Grant and Jim Crawley, ''Transference and Projection''(Buckingham 2002), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  used for ridding the self of unwanted parts or for controlling the other's body and mind.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''On Learning from the Patient'' (1985) p. 100n&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experience==
Though a difficult concept for the conscious mind to come to terms with,&lt;ref&gt;Priscilla Roth, 'Projective Identification', in S. Budd/R.Rusbridger eds., ''Introducing Psychoanalysis'' (2005) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; since its primitive nature makes its operation or interpretation seem more like magic or art than science,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; projective identification is nonetheless a powerful tool of interpersonal communication.

The recipient of the projection may suffer a loss of both identity and insight as they are caught up in and [[Psychological manipulation|manipulated]] by the other person's fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (Penguin 1969) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; One therapist, for example, describes how "I felt the progressive extrusion of his internalized mother into me, not as a theoretical construct but in actual experience. The intonation of my voice altered, became higher with the distinctly ''Ur-mutter'' quality."&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (Penguin 1974) p. 113–4&lt;/ref&gt; If the projection can be accepted and understood, however, much insight into the projector will be obtained.

Projective identification differs from simple projection in that projective identification can become a [[self-fulfilling prophecy]], whereby a person, believing something false about another, influences or coerces that other person to carry out that precise projection.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath/Terence Dawson, ''The Cambridge Companion to Jung'' (Cambridge 1977) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; In extreme cases, the recipient may lose any sense of their real self and become reduced to the passive carrier of outside projections, as if possessed by them.&lt;ref&gt;T. Pitt-Aikens/A. T. Ellis, ''Loss of the Good Authority'' (London 1989) p. 120 and p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objects projected==

The objects (feelings, attitudes) extruded in projective identification are of various kinds – both good and bad, ideal and [[Abjection|abjected]].

Hope may be projected by a client into their therapist, when they can no longer consciously feel it themselves;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 121-2&lt;/ref&gt; equally, it may be a fear of (psychic) dying which is projected.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Parsons, ''The Dove that Returns, the Dove that Vanishes'' (2000) p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggression may be projected, leaving the projector's personality diminished and reduced;&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (2006) p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; alternatively it may be desire, leaving the projector feeling asexual.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 69–73&lt;/ref&gt;

The good/ideal parts of the personality may be projected, leading to dependence upon the object of identification;&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Minsky, ''Psychoanalysis and Gender'' (1998) p. 86-7&lt;/ref&gt; equally it may be jealousy or [[envy]] that are projected, perhaps by the therapist into the client.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (1993) p. 11–2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intensity==

Projective identification may take place with varying degrees of intensity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/projective-identification Robert D. Hinshelwood, "Projective Identification"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[narcissism]], extremely powerful projections may take place and obliterate the distinction between self and other.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, Klein (1979) p. 116–9&lt;/ref&gt;

In less disturbed personalities, projective identification is not only a way of getting rid of feelings but also of getting help with them.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (London 1990) p. 98–9&lt;/ref&gt;

In an emotionally balanced person, projective identification may act as a bridge to [[empathy]] and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive understanding]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enotes.com/psychoanalysis-encyclopedia/projective-identification Robert D. Hinshelwood, "Projective Identification"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Various types of projective identification have been distinguished over the years:
* '''Acquisitive projective identification''' - where someone takes on the attributes of someone else. Unlike '''attributive projective identification''', where someone else is induced to become one's own projection.&lt;ref&gt;John Rowan and Michael Jacobs, ''The Therapist's Use of Self'' (Buckingham 2002) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Projective counter-identification''' - where the therapist unwittingly assumes the feelings and role of the patient to the point where he acts out within the therapy within this assumed role that has been projected into him, a step beyond the therapist merely receiving the patient's projections without acting on them.&lt;ref&gt;Grinberg L (1962) On a specific aspect of countertransference due to the patient's projective identification (In Classics of Psychoanalytical Technique)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Dual projective identification''' - a concept introduced by [[Joan Lachkar]]. It primarily occurs when both partners in a relationship simultaneously project onto one another. Both deny the projections, both identify with those projections.&lt;ref&gt;''The Narcissistic/Borderline Couple: A Psychoanalytic Perspective on Marital Treatment (1st ed.).'' New York: Brunner/Mazel, 1992. {{ISBN|0-87630-634-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A division has also been made between '''normal projective identification''' and '''pathological projective identification''', where what is projected is splintered into minute pieces before the projection takes place.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal,''Introduction to the work of Melanie Klein'' (London 1964), p. 42-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychotherapy==

As with [[transference]] and [[countertransference]], projective identification can be a potential key to therapeutic understanding, especially where the therapist is able to tolerate and contain the unwanted, negative aspects of the patient's self over time.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Stewart, ''Psychic Experience and Problems of Technique'' (London 1992), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transactional analysis]] emphasizes the need for the therapist's Adult to remain uncontaminated, if the experience of the client's projective identification is to be usefully understood.&lt;ref&gt;Petruska Clarkson, ''On Psychotherapy'' (London 1993), p. 180 and p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wounded couple==

Relationship problems have been linked to the way there can be a division of [[emotional labour]] in a couple, by way of projective identification, with one partner carrying projected aspects of the other for them.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Thus one partner may carry all the aggression or all the competence in the relationship, the other all the vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;R. Skynner/J. Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (1993) p. 47–54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Jung|Jungians]] describe the resultant dynamics as characterising a so-called "wounded couple" – projective identification ensuring that each carries the most ideal or the most primitive parts of their counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath and Terence Dawson eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Jung'' (Cambridge 1997) p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; The two partners may initially have been singled out for that very readiness to carry parts of each other's self; but the projected inner conflicts/division then come to be replicated in the partnership itself.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath and Terence Dawson eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Jung'' (Cambridge 1997) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

Conscious resistance to such projective identification&lt;ref&gt;Polly Young-Eisendrath and Terence Dawson eds., ''The Cambridge Companion to Jung'' (Cambridge 1997) p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; may produce on the one side [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] for refusing to enact the projection,&lt;ref&gt;R. D. Laing, ''Self and Others'' (Penguin 1969) p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; on the other bitter rage at the thwarting of the projection.&lt;ref&gt;Neville Symington, ''Narcissism: A New Theory'' (London 1993) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''RepRap Snappy''' is an [[Open-source model|open-source]] [[fused deposition modeling]] [[3D printer]], part of the [[RepRap project]], it is the most self replicating 3D printer in the world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hackaday.com/2015/09/12/the-most-self-replicating-reprap-yet/|title=The Most Self-Replicating RepRap Yet|last=By|website=Hackaday|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="atlasobscura.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-utopian-promise-of-reprap-the-3d-printer-that-can-almost-print-itself|title=The Utopian Promise Of RepRap, the 3D Printer That Can—Almost—Print Itself|date=2016-02-24|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5400">'''Repressive desublimation''' is a term first coined by philosopher and sociologist [[Herbert Marcuse]] in his 1964 work ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'', that refers to the way in which, in advanced industrial society (capitalism), "the progress of technological rationality is liquidating the oppositional and transcending elements in the “higher culture.”&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, ''One-Dimensional Man'' (London 2002) p. 75-8&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, where art was previously a way to represent "that which is" from "that which is not,"&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, ''One-Dimensional Man'' (London 2002) p. 75-8&lt;/ref&gt; capitalist society causes the "flattening out"&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, ''One-Dimensional Man'' (London 2002) p. 75-8&lt;/ref&gt; of art into a commodity incorporated into society itself. As Marcuse put it in ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]'', "The music of the soul is also the music of salesmanship."

By offering instantaneous, rather than mediated, gratifications,&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Marcuse, ''One-Dimensional Man'' (London 2002) p. 75-8&lt;/ref&gt; repressive desublimation was considered by Marcuse to remove the energies otherwise available for a social critique; and thus to function as a conservative force ''under the guise of'' liberation.

==Origins and influence==

The roots of Marcuse's concept have been traced to the earlier writings of [[Wilhelm Reich]] and [[Theodor Adorno]],&lt;ref&gt;G. Horowitz, ''Repression'' (1977) p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to a shared knowledge of the [[Freud]]ian idea of the involution of [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]].&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcuse's idea fed into the [[student activism]] of the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Cranston, 'Neocommunism and the Students' Revolts' ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' Vol 1 (1968) p. 49-52&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being debated at a more formal level by figures such as [[Hannah Arendt]] and [[Norman O. Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, p. 53-60&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, [[Ernest Mandel]] took up Marcuse's theme in his analysis of how dreams of escape through sex (or drugs) were commodified as part of the growing commercialisation of leisure in [[late modernity|late capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Mandel, ''Late Capitalism'' (London 1975) p. 502 and p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent developments==

Critical  exploration of contemporary [[Raunch culture]] has been usefully linked to the notion of repressive desublimation.&lt;ref&gt;Chloe Avril, ''The Feminist Utopian novels of Charlotte Perkins Gilman'' (2008) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

But some [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] thought - while accepting repressive desublimation as a fairly accurate description of changing social mores, - see the ensuing [[Superficiality|depthlessness]] of postmodernism as something to be celebrated, not (as with Marcuse) condemned.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne DeKoven, ''Utopia Unlimited'' (2004) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the advertisement-based system of mass sexualised  commodification of the nineties meshed comfortably with the conservative, post-political ethos of the times, to create a kind of media-friendly and increasingly pervasive superficial sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bracewell, ''The Nineties: When Surface was Depth'' (London 2003) p. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Figures like [[Slavoj Zizek]] however have taken up Marcuse's idea in a more critical sense, to explore the postmodern short-circuiting of desire, and effacement of the psychological dimension to sex.&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Zizek, ''The Metastases of Enjoyment'' (2005) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Here what has been called the socialisation of the unconscious into mass form of pleasure-drills,&lt;ref&gt;Ken Geller, ''The Horror Reader'' (2000) p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; and the exercise of control through the command to transgress, rather than to repress,&lt;ref&gt;Antonios Vadolas, ''Perversions of Fascism'' (2009) p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; appear as practical instances of repressive desublimation pervading global culture.

==Criticism==

Marcuse's idea has been criticized for utopianism in seeking to envisage an alternative to the happy consciousness of repressive desublimation that permeates postmodern culture, as well as for modernist elitism in his appeal for critical leverage to an 'autonomous' sphere of high culture.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks eds., ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000) p. 127-8 and p. 363-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] expanded the concept into 'hyper-repressive desublimation', and simultaneously criticized it for ignoring the plurality and extent of competing sexual discourses that emerged from the [[sexual revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Miklitsch, ''From Hegel to Madonna'' (1998) p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Sna large.png|thumb|250px|A drawing of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] in which each person is represented by a dot called a [[node (graph theory)|node]] and the friendship relationship is represented by a line called an edge]]

[[File:Social graph.gif|250px|thumb|This animation shows the different types of relations between social objects. User '''Eva''' is a friend of '''Adam''' and '''Kate''', though '''Adam''' and '''Kate''' are not friends themselves. '''Peter's''' photo was "liked" by many users, including '''Eva'''. Also '''Eva''' listened to the '''[[Last.fm]]''' radio and watched the video from '''[[YouTube]]'''.]]

The '''social graph''' in the [[Internet]] context is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] that depicts personal relations of internet users. In short, it is a model or representation of a [[social network]], where the word '''graph''' has been taken from [[graph theory]]. The social graph has been referred to as "the global mapping of everybody and how they're related".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/21/tech/main6418458.shtml "Facebook: One Social Graph to Rule Them All?"]. CBS News. Retrieved July 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was popularized at the [[Facebook F8]] conference on May 24, 2007, when it was used to explain how the newly introduced [[Facebook Platform]] would take advantage of the relationships between individuals to offer a richer online experience.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2007/05/facebook-unveils-platform-for-developers-of-social-applications/ "Facebook Unveils Platform for Developers of Social Applications"]. Facebook. Retrieved July 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition has been expanded to refer to a social graph of all Internet users.

Since explaining the concept of the social graph, [[Mark Zuckerberg]], one of the founders of Facebook, has often touted Facebook's goal of offering the website's social graph to other websites so that a user's relationships can be put to use on websites outside Facebook's control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/facebooks-zuckerberg-uncorks-the-social-graph/5156 "Facebook's Zuckerberg uncorks the social graph"]. ZDNet. Retrieved July 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
Several issues have come forward regarding the existing implementation of the social graph owned by Facebook. For example, currently, a social networking service is unaware of the relationships forged between individuals on a different service. This creates an online experience that is not seamless, and instead provides for a fragmented experience due to the lack of an openly available graph between services. In addition, existing services define relationships differently.

{{As of|2010}}, Facebook's social graph is the largest [[social network]] dataset in the world,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/04/one-graph-to-rule-them-all.html "One Graph To Rule Them All?"]. A VC. Retrieved July 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and it contains the largest number of defined relationships between the largest number of people among all websites because it is the most widely used social networking service in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/aug2008/tc20080812_853725.htm "Facebook: No. 1 Globally"]. ''BusinessWeek''. Retrieved July 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Concern has focused on the fact that Facebook's social graph is owned by the company and is not shared with other services, giving it a major advantage over other services and preventing its users from taking their graph with them to other services when they wish to do so, such as when a user is dissatisfied with Facebook. [[Google]] has attempted to offer a solution to this problem by creating the Social Graph API, released in January 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/internet/webdev/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=206102122 "Google Launches Social Graph API"]. ''InformationWeek''.

== Open Graph == 
{{further|Facebook Platform#Open Graph protocol}}
Facebook's Graph API allows websites to draw information about more objects than simply people, including photos, events, and pages, and their relationships between each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18368">{{About|behavior imitation to reflect correct social behavior|imitation to gain approval|normative social influence}}

'''Social proof''', a term coined by Dr. Robert Cialdini in his 1984 book, ''Influence'', is also known as '''informational social influence'''.  It describes a [[Psychology|psychological]] and [[social]] phenomenon wherein people copy the actions of others in an attempt to undertake behavior in a given situation. 

Social proof is considered prominent in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate ''mode of behavior'', and is driven by the assumption that the surrounding people possess more knowledge about the current situation.

The effects of [[social influence]] can be seen in the tendency of large groups to conform to choices which are either correct or mistaken. This is referred to in some publications as the ''[[herd behavior]]''. Although social proof reflects a rational motive to take into account the information possessed by others, formal analysis shows that it can cause people to converge too quickly upon a single distinct choice, so that decisions of even larger groups of individuals may be grounded in very little information (see [[information cascade]]s).

Social proof is one type of [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]].  When a person is in a situation where they are unsure of the correct way to behave, they will often look to others for clues concerning the correct behavior. When "we conform because we believe that others' interpretation of an ambiguous situation is more accurate than ours and will help us choose an appropriate course of action",&lt;ref&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T.D., &amp; Akert, A.M.  (2005).  Social Psychology (5th ed.).  Upper Saddle River, NJ:  Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; it is informational social influence.  This is contrasted with [[normative social influence]] wherein a person conforms to be liked or accepted by others.

Social proof often leads not only to public [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]] (conforming to the behavior of others publicly without necessarily believing it is correct) but also private acceptance (conforming out of a genuine belief that others are correct).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelman|first=H. C.|title=Compliance, identification, and internalization three processes of attitude change|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|date=1 March 1958|volume=2|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.1177/002200275800200106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Social proof is more powerful when being accurate is more important and when others are perceived as especially knowledgeable.

== Mechanisms ==

===Multiple source effect===
The multiple source effect occurs when people give more credence to ideas that are stated by multiple sources. This effect can be clearly seen when social proof occurs.  For instance, one study observed that people who hear five positive reviews on a book as read by five different synthesized voices perceive that book more favourably than if they hear the same five reviews as read by one synthesized voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Kwan Min|title=The Multiple Source Effect and Synthesized Speech.|journal=Human Communication Research|date=1 April 2004|volume=30|issue=2|pages=182–207|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2004.tb00730.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uncertainty about the correct conclusion===
Uncertainty is a major factor that encourages the use of social proof. One study found that when evaluating a product, consumers were more likely to incorporate the opinions of others through the use of social proof when their own experiences with the product were ambiguous, leaving uncertainty as to the correct conclusion that they should make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wooten|first=D|author2=ReedII, A |title=Informational Influence and the Ambiguity of Product Experience: Order Effects on the Weighting of Evidence|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|date=1 January 1998|volume=7|issue=1|pages=79–99|doi=10.1207/s15327663jcp0701_04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarity to the surrounding group===
Similarity also motivates the use of social proof; when a person perceives themselves as similar to the people around them, they are more likely to adopt and perceive as correct the observed behavior of these people. This has been noted in areas such as the use of [[laugh tracks]], where participants will laugh longer and harder when they perceive the people laughing to be similar to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Platow|first=Michael J.|author2=Haslam, S. Alexander |author3=Both, Amanda |author4=Chew, Ivanne |author5=Cuddon, Michelle |author6=Goharpey, Nahal |author7=Maurer, Jacqui |author8=Rosini, Simone |author9=Tsekouras, Anna |author10=Grace, Diana M. |title="It’s not funny if they’re laughing": Self-categorization, social influence, and responses to canned laughter☆|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|date=1 September 2005|volume=41|issue=5|pages=542–550|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2004.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social proof is also one of [[Robert Cialdini|Robert Cialdini's]]  six principles of persuasion, (along with reciprocity, commitment/consistency, authority, liking, and scarcity) which maintains that people are especially likely to perform certain actions if they can relate to the people who performed the same actions before them.&lt;ref name="Cialdini 2001 72–79"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cialdini|first=Robert B.|title=Harnessing the science of persuasion|journal=Harvard Business Review|date=October 2001|volume=79|issue=9|pages=72–79}}&lt;/ref&gt; One experiment which exemplifies this claim was conducted by researchers who joined a door-to-door charity campaign, who found that if a list of prior donators was longer, the next person solicited was more likely to donate as well. This trend was even more pronounced when the names on the donor list were people that the prospective donor knew, such as friends and neighbors.&lt;ref name="Cialdini 2001 72–79"/&gt; Cialdini's principle also asserts that peer power is effective because people are more likely respond to influence tactics applied horizontally rather than vertically, so people are more likely to be persuaded by a colleague than a superior.&lt;ref name="Cialdini 2001 72–79"/&gt;

== Research ==

=== Early research ===
The most famous study of social proof is [[Muzafer Sherif|Muzafer Sherif's]] 1935 experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sherif | first1 = M | year = 1935 | title = A study of some social factors in perception | url = | journal = Archives of Psychology | volume = 27 | issue = | page = 187 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this experiment subjects were placed in a dark room and asked to look at a dot of light about 15 feet away.  They were then asked how much, in inches, the dot of light was moving.  In reality it was not moving at all, but due to the [[autokinetic effect]] it appeared to move.  How much the light appears to move varies from person to person but is generally consistent over time for each individual.  A few days later a second part of the experiment was conducted. Each subject was paired with two other subjects and asked to give their estimate of how much the light was moving out loud. Even though the subjects had previously given different estimates, the groups would come to a common estimate.  To rule out the possibility that the subjects were simply giving the group answer to avoid looking foolish while still believing their original estimate was correct, Sherif had the subjects judge the lights again by themselves after doing so in the group.  They maintained the group's judgment.  Because the movement of the light is ambiguous the participants were relying on each other to define reality.

Another study looked at informational social influence in [[eyewitness identification]].  Subjects were shown a slide of the "perpetrator".  They were then shown a slide of a line-up of four men, one of whom was the perpetrator they had seen, and were asked to pick him out.  The task was made difficult to the point of ambiguity by presenting the slides very quickly.  The task was done in a group that consisted of one actual subject and three confederates (a person acting as a subject but actually working for the experimenter).  The confederates answered first and all three gave the same wrong answer.  In a high-importance condition of the experiment subjects were told that they were participating in a real test of eyewitness identification ability that would be used by police departments and courts, and their scores would establish the norm for performance.  In a low-importance condition subjects were told that the slide task was still being developed and that the experimenters had no idea what the norm for performance was—they were just looking for useful hints to improve the task. It was found that when subjects thought the task was of high importance they were more likely to conform, giving the confederate's wrong answer 51% of the time as opposed to 35% of the time in the low-importance condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baron|first=Robert S.|author2=Vandello, Joseph A. |author3=Brunsman, Bethany |title=The forgotten variable in conformity research: Impact of task importance on social influence.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 1996|volume=71|issue=5|pages=915–927|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.5.915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural effects on social proof===
The strength of social proof also varies across different cultures. For instance, studies have shown that subjects in collectivist cultures conform to others' social proof more often than those in individualist cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bond|first=Rod|author2=Peter B. Smith |title=Culture and Conformity: A Meta-analysis of Studies Using Asch’s (1952, 1956) Line Judgment Task|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1996|volume=119|pages=111–37|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.119.1.111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this trend seems reoccurring, there is evidence which suggests that these results are a simplification, and that an independent subject's personal individualistic-collectivist tendency also makes an impact upon their decisions.&lt;ref name="Cialdini 1999 1242–1253"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cialdini|first=Robert B.|author2=Wosinska, W. |author3=Barett, D. W. |author4=Gornik-Durose, M. |title=Compliance with a request in two cultures: The differential influence of social proof and commitment/consistency on collectivists and individualists|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=October 1999|volume=25|issue=10|pages=1242–1253|doi=10.1177/0146167299258006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional variables, such as the subject's sense of social responsibility, need to be taken into account to better understand the mechanisms of social proof across cultures; for example, more collectivist individuals will often have an increased compulsion to help others because of their prominent awareness of social responsibility, and this in turn will increase the likelihood they will comply to requests, regardless of their peers' previous decisions.&lt;ref name="Cialdini 1999 1242–1253"/&gt;

=== Copycat suicides ===
{{further|Copycat suicide#Social proof model}}
Social proof has been proposed as an explanation for [[copycat suicide]], where suicide rates increase following media publication about suicides.&lt;ref name="influence" /&gt; One study using [[agent-based modeling]] showed that copycat suicides are more likely when there are similarities between the person involved in the publicized suicide and the potential copycats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mesoudi|first=Alex|author2=Jones, James Holland |title=The Cultural Dynamics of Copycat Suicide|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=4|issue=9|pages=e7252|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007252|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=James Holland|pmid=19789643|pmc=2748702|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, research performed by David Phillips between 1947 and 1968 further supports the existence of copycat suicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffmann-Richter|first=Ulrike|title=The Werther Effect and Assisted Suicide|journal=Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior|date=Summer 2003|volume=33|issue=2|pages=192–200|doi=10.1521/suli.33.2.192.22768|last2=Schenker|first2=Tanja|last3=Finzen|first3=Asmus|last4=Dittmann|first4=Volker|last5=Kraeuchi|first5=Kurt|last6=Hoffmann-Richter|first6=Ulrike|pmid=12882420}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

===In employment===
A person who has been [[unemployed]] for a long time may have a hard time finding a new job—even if they are highly skilled and qualified.  Potential employers attribute wrongly the person's lack of employment to the person rather than the situation.  This causes the potential employers to search more intensively for flaws or other negative characteristics that are "congruent" with or explain the person's failure and to discount the applicant's virtues.

Similarly, a person who is in high demand—for example a [[CEO]]—may continue to get many attractive job offers and can, as a result, extract a considerable wage premium—even if his/her objective performance has been poor.  When people appear successful, potential employers and others who evaluate them tend to search more intensively for virtues or positive characteristics that are "congruent" with or explain the person's success, and
to ignore or underestimate the person's faults.  People who experience positive social proof may also benefit from a [[halo effect]].  Other attributes are deemed to be more positive than they actually are.  Additionally, the person's attributes may be viewed with a positive [[Framing effect (psychology)|framing]] bias.  For example, a person might be viewed as arrogant if they have negative social proof, and bold if they have positive social proof. For these reasons, social proof is important in determining a potential employer's [[consideration set]].

Social proof naturally also applies to products and is used extensively in marketing and sales.

Situations that violate social proof can cause [[cognitive dissonance]], and can cause people to have a sense of loss of control or failure of the "[[just world hypothesis]]".

===In entertainment===
Theaters sometimes use [[Claque|specially planted audience members]] who are instructed to give ovations at pre-arranged times. Usually, these people are the ones who clap initially, and the rest of the audience follows. Such ovations may be perceived by non-expert audience members as signals of the performance's quality.

Contrary to common annoyance of [[laugh track|canned laughter]] in television shows, television studios have discovered that they can increase the perceived "funniness" of a show by merely playing canned laughter at key "funny" moments. They have found that even though viewers find canned laughter highly annoying, they perceive shows that happen to use canned laughter more funny than the shows that do not use canned laughter.&lt;ref name="influence"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cialdini|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Cialdini|title=Influence|year=1993|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In social media ===
Social proof is also prominent on social networks such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. The number of followers, fans, views, likes, favorites and even comments that a user has made, positively affects how other users perceive them. A user on Twitter with a million followers is perceived as more trustworthy and reputable than a similar user with a thousand followers, resulting in faster growth of followers and higher engagement and click-through-rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Using Social Proof for your Digital Success ϟ Devumi|url = https://devumi.com/social-proof-in-digital-success/|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Although, these fake followers will never help meet business objectives or generate sales directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Proof in Social Media|url=https://somiibo.com/blog/social-proof-in-social-media/|website=somiibo.com|accessdate=3 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An entire multimillion-dollar industry, known as [[ghost followers]], exist for the sole purpose of increasing social proof on social media.

===The environment===

Social norms are often not clearly articulated for sustainable or pro-environmental conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/social-norm-behaviour-change | author = Corner, Adam | title = Social norm strategies do work – but there are risks involved. |date=December 16, 2011 | work = Guardian Professional Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modifiers ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}

===Possession of special knowledge===
If one perceives that s/he is better advised about a situation than the surrounding group, then s/he is less likely to follow the group's behavior.

===Identification with authority===
If one perceives themselves as a relevant authority figure in the situation, they are less likely to follow the surrounding group's behavior. This is a combination of "Identification of the surrounding group with self" and "Possession of special knowledge". People in authority positions tend to place themselves in different categories than other people and usually they have special training or knowledge that allows them to conclude that they are better informed than the surrounding group.

==="Smart money"===
One might perceive particular groups of others, identified by their behavior or other characteristics, to be more reliable guides to the situation than the average person. One might think truck drivers to be more frequent, and therefore more experienced drivers than others, and therefore weigh more heavily the number of trucks than the number of cars parked when judging the quality of a restaurant.  One might identify the movement of betting odds or securities prices at certain times as revealing the preferences of "smart money"—those more likely to be in the know.

His father was a [[World War II]] veteran with the [[U.S. Navy]] who later became a film editor with [[CBS News]].  His mother was a homemaker.&lt;ref name="theaustinbulldog.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Steve Adler Launches Mayoral Campaign|url=http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=294:steve-adler-launches-mayoral-campaign&amp;catid=3:main-articles|website=The Austin Bulldog|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, he graduated from [[Princeton University]] with a B.A from the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Princeton Alumni Weekly|date=1977|page=18|edition=Volume 78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exZbAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA3-PA62 |accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He then attended the [[University of Texas School of Law|University of Texas at Austin School of Law]] and received his [[juris doctorate]] in 1982.

== Legal career ==

In the mid 1980s, Steve Adler co-founded the Barron, Graham &amp; Adler LLP law firm, later Barron &amp; Adler, LLP. He represented primarily landowners who were dealing with eminent domain and condemnation cases where the government or a private company seek to acquire their property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mr./Ms. Mayor|url=http://www.atxman.com/mr-ms-mayor|website=Austin Man Magazine|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to this practice, Adler spent most of the 1980s, his early legal career, doing civil rights employment discrimination cases.  This work included representing women as well as Hispanic, African American and other minority workers in federal court, before the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission|Equal Employment and Opportunity Commission]] and on matters filed with the [[Human Rights Commission of Austin (Texas)|Austin Human Rights Commission]].&lt;ref name="DoneForAustin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Time Candidate to Announce Run for Mayor|url=http://impactnews.com/austin-metro/central-austin/first-time-candidate-to-announce-run-for-mayor/|website=Impact News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He represented clients seeking equal treatment and opportunity in the workplace, redress from sexual harassment and denial of [[equal pay for equal work]].

Adler has argued before state appellate courts, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]], and the [[Texas Supreme Court]] and was named a Texas Super Lawyer from 2007-2013 and one of the Best Lawyers in America in 2007-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Super Lawyers|url=http://www.superlawyers.com/texas/lawyer/Stephen-I-Adler/7a77cdda-d332-4411-bf4c-7c7ef366de60.html|website=Super Lawyers|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
== Community leadership ==

Adler has been involved in a number of community organizations in the [[Greater Austin]] region. In 2010, he joined the board of GENaustin (formerly Girls Empowerment Network), an organization that provides education and mentoring to middle school girls in local school districts to help them make good choices.&lt;ref name="DoneForAustin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Articles of Incorporation for the Ophelia Education Foundation|url=http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=317&amp;limit=5&amp;limitstart=0&amp;order=name&amp;dir=DESC&amp;Itemid=22|website=The Austin Bulldog|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009-2012, Adler served as the board chair of the Anti-Defamation League Austin Region where he contributed to the creation of the Austin Hate Crimes Task Force and expanding the [http://www.adl.org/npfh/ No Place for Hate] anti-bullying program from just a few schools to over 300 schools throughout Central Texas.&lt;ref name="DoneForAustin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Steve Adler: 'New Way Forward'"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Defamation League National Leadership Conference|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?305723-1/antidefamation-league-national-leadership-conference|website=C-SPAN|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Defamation League Austin|url=http://austin.adl.org/|website=Anti-Defamation League Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
    
Steve Adler has served on the [[Ballet Austin]] board since the late 1990s and he has supported the organizations work to provide community access to arts, and the creation of new works, including collaborations with organizations in other major cities in the [[United States]] and abroad.&lt;ref name="DoneForAustin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014/15 Board of Directors|url=http://www.balletaustin.org/about/board.php|website=Ballet Austin|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adler was on the founding board of directors for the Texas Tribune in 2009.  He was later appointed board chair, a role he resigned from in January 2014 in order to launch his run for Austin mayor.&lt;ref name="DoneForAustin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Form 990 Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax|url=http://www.theaustinbulldog.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=317&amp;limit=5&amp;limitstart=0&amp;order=name&amp;dir=DESC&amp;Itemid=22|website=The Austin Bulldog|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early political career ==

Adler is the first mayor to serve as part of the "10-1" City Council system that was approved via referendum by voters during the 2012 election and implemented after the 2014 election.&lt;ref name=KXAN2015&gt;{{cite news |title=Austin's new mayor and city council take office |date=January 6, 2015 |work=KXAN| url=http://kxan.com/2015/01/06/austins-new-mayor-and-city-council-take-office/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the Austin City Council was composed of six at-large Council members and a mayor. The new system is composed of ten Council members representing geographic districts and the mayor. 
[[File:Steve Adler Richard Overton.jpg|alt=Steve Adler and Richard Overton |thumb|Mayor Steve Adler made a statement regarding the Veteran's Day Parade.

"I will not be marching in the Congress Avenue parade because that parade will include groups carrying the Confederate flag. Veterans Day should only be about honoring United States Military Veterans. Symbols of racism, Civil War secession, and white supremacy should not be forgotten or erased, but they need to be remembered and studied in museums and classrooms not cheered and applauded in parades."

The push to move to the geographic districts was prompted by Austin's dramatic population growth as well as a recognition that the former system often resulted in an underrepresentation of Austin's minority communities, particularly its rapidly growing Latino population.&lt;ref name=AustinChronicle2013&gt;{{cite news |title=The road to 10-1 |first=Elizabeth |last=Pagano |date=February 1, 2013 |work=Austin Chronicle| url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2013-02-01/the-road-to-10-1/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For years, the city's political establishment had abided by an unwritten "gentleman's agreement" that reserved one Council seat for a Latino and one for an African American.&lt;ref name=KUT2012&gt;{{cite news |title=Hispanic Leaders call for change to Gentleman's Agreement, just not yet |first=Daniel |last=Guerra |date=April 23, 2012 |work=KUT| url=http://kut.org/post/hispanic-leaders-call-change-gentlemens-agreement-just-not-yet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2015, Adler denounced an anonymous group's attempt to inflame discussion of gentrification in historically black neighborhoods of East Austin by placing stickers on the doors of East Side businesses that proclaimed them off-limits to non-whites.&lt;ref name=AASMarch2015&gt;{{cite news |title=Austin Mayor Steve Adler: 'White people' stickers appalling, offensive|first=Ciara |last=O'Rourke |date=March 18, 2015 |work=Austin American-Statesman |url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/crime-law/exclusively-for-white-people-stickers-found-on-sug/nkY7f/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This is an appalling and offensive display of ignorance in our city," said Adler. "Our city is a place where respect for all people is a part of our spirit and soul. We will keep it that way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austin mayor outraged by 'white people only' stickers posted on businesses|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/19/us/austin-white-people-sticker/index.html|website=CNN|accessdate=March 19, 2015|date=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adler has been a proponent of the Office of Equity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayoradler.com/great-cities-do-big-things-state-of-our-city-feb-16-2016-austin-texas/&lt;/ref&gt; Following a six-month search, Brion Oaks was selected September 2016 as the City's first Chief Equity Officer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/brion-oaks-named-citys-first-chief-equity-officer/nsZSq/&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, when the [[Alamo Drafthouse Cinema]] in Austin announced that it would hold a women-only screening of the movie ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'', one man wrote Mayor Adler an angry email about allowing the event to take place, in which he urged the boycott of Austin and called women "the second rate gender". Adler's response, in which he warned the writer that his email account had been "hacked by ... an unusually hostile individual", and listed women's accomplishments, drew national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/mayor-on-men-boycotting-all-female-wonder-woman-screening-w485342|title=Mayor Responds to Boycott of All-Female 'Wonder Woman' Screening|last=Chen|first=Joyce|date=June 1, 2017|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/06/01/wonder-woman-all-female-screenings-mayor-steve-adler/|title=Wonder Woman: Mayor defends all-female screening|last=Romano|first=Nick|date=June 1, 2017|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2017/06/02/austin-mayor-wonder-woman-women-only-screening-drafthouse/|title=Austin mayor claps back at "Wonder Woman" women-only screening hater|last=Serena|first=Katie|date=June 2, 2017|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Adler and the federal [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] declared that significant progress had been made to house homeless veterans.&lt;ref&gt;http://kxan.com/2016/08/19/austin-plan-to-house-all-homeless-veterans-accomplished/&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite progress in the area of veterans, work remains to be done to further reduce homelessness and associated drug use.  During the summer of 2016, several people were hospitalized during an outbreak of K2 overdoses around the Austin Resource Center for the Homeless.&lt;ref&gt;http://keyetv.com/news/local/officials-concerned-about-k2-outbreak-in-austin&lt;/ref&gt;

Adler won reelection in 2018, garnering 59% of the vote in a 7-way race.

A '''subject''' is a being who has a [[subjective consciousness|unique consciousness]] and/or unique [[personhood|personal experiences]], or an entity that has a relationship with another entity that exists outside itself (called an "[[Object (philosophy)|object]]").

A ''subject'' is an observer and an ''object'' is a thing observed. This concept is especially important in [[Continental philosophy]], where 'the subject' is a central term in debates over the nature of the self.&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; The nature of the subject is also central in debates over the nature of [[subjective experience]] within the Anglo-American tradition of [[analytical philosophy]].

The sharp distinction between subject and object corresponds to the distinction, in the philosophy of [[René Descartes]], between thought and extension. Descartes believed that [[Mental substance|thought]] ([[subjectivity]]) was the essence of the mind, and that [[res extensa|extension]] (the occupation of space) was the essence of matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Descartes|first=René |title=The Principles of Philosophy|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4391/pg4391-images.html|section=LIII|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==German idealism==
''Subject'' as a key-term in thinking about human [[consciousness]] began its career with the [[German Idealist]]s, in response to [[David Hume]]'s radical [[skepticism]]. The idealists' starting point was Hume's conclusion that there is nothing to the self over and above a big, fleeting bundle of perceptions.  The next step was to ask how this undifferentiated bundle comes to be experienced as a unity&amp;nbsp;– as a single ''subject''. Hume had offered the following proposal:

:"''...the imagination must by long custom acquire the same method of thinking, and run along the parts of space and time in conceiving its objects.''&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David. {{Google books|6c3f0NqRmnUC|The Philosophical Works of David Hume (1826 edition)|page=27|19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and their successors sought to flesh out the process by which the subject is constituted out of the flow of sense impressions.  Hegel, for example, stated in his Preface to the ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' that a subject is constituted by "the process of reflectively mediating itself with itself."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hegel/works/ph/phprefac.htm Preface to the ''Phenomenology of Spirit'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel begins his definition of the subject at a standpoint derived from [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] physics: "the unmoved which is also ''self-moving''" (Preface, para. 22).  That is, what is not moved by an outside force, but which propels itself, has a ''prima facie'' case for subjectivity.  Hegel's next step, however, is to identify this power to move, this unrest that is the subject, as ''pure negativity''.  Subjective self-motion, for Hegel, comes not from any pure or simple kernel of authentic individuality, but rather, it is

::"...the bifurcation of the simple; it is the doubling which sets up opposition, and then again the negation of this indifferent diversity and of its anti-thesis" (Preface, para. 18).

The Hegelian subject's ''modus operandi'' is therefore cutting, splitting and introducing distinctions by injecting negation into the flow of sense-perceptions.  Subjectivity is thus a kind of structural effect&amp;nbsp;– what happens when Nature is diffused, refracted around a field of negativity and the "unity of the subject" for Hegel, is in fact a second-order effect, a "negation of negation".  The subject experiences itself as a unity only by purposively negating the very diversity it itself had produced. The Hegelian subject may therefore be characterized either as "self-restoring sameness" or else as "reflection in otherness within itself" (Preface, para. 18).

==Continental philosophy&lt;!--'Assujettissement', 'Ethopoiein', 'Split subject', 'Subjectivation', 'Subjectification', 'Post-structuralist subject' and 'Poststructuralist subject' redirect here; linked from 'Template:Deleuze-Guattari'--&gt;==
The thinking of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud]] provided a point of departure for questioning the notion of a unitary, autonomous Subject, which for many thinkers in the Continental tradition is seen as the foundation of the [[liberal theory]] of the [[social contract]].  These thinkers opened up the way for the [[deconstruction]] of the subject as a core-concept of [[metaphysics]].

Sigmund Freud's explorations of the [[unconscious mind]] added up to a wholesale indictment of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] notions of subjectivity.

Among the most radical re-thinkers of human self-consciousness was [[Martin Heidegger]], whose concept of ''[[Dasein]]'' or "Being-there" displaces traditional notions of the personal subject altogether. With Heidegger, phenomenology tries to go beyond the classical dichotomy between subject and object, because they are linked by an inseparable and original relationship, in the sense that  there can be no world without a subject, nor the subject without world.&lt;ref&gt;Farina, Gabriella (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-07.pdf Some reflections on the phenomenological method]". ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):506–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan]], inspired by Heidegger and [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], built on Freud's [[psychoanalytic]] model of the subject, in which the "'''[[Splitting (psychology)|split]] subject'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;" is constituted by a [[double bind]]: alienated from [[jouissance]] when he or she leaves [[the Real]], enters into [[the Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|the Imaginary]] (during the [[mirror stage]]), and separates from the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]] when he or she comes into the realm of language, difference, and [[Demand (psychoanalysis)|demand]] in [[the Symbolic]] or [[the Name of the Father]].&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Stewart, Maire Jaanus, Richard Feldstein (eds.), ''Lacan in the German-Speaking World'', SUNY Press, 2004, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thinkers such as [[structural Marxist]] [[Louis Althusser]] and [[poststructuralist]] [[Michel Foucault]]&lt;ref name=:0&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/heartfield-james.htm#n13 |title = Postmodernism and the 'Death of the Subject' |last = Heartfield |first = James |year = 2002 |work = The Death of the Subject |accessdate= 28 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; theorize the subject as a [[social construction]], the so-called '''poststructuralist subject'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Edel Heuven, "The Poststructuralist Subject and the Paradox of Internal Coherence", M.Sc. thesis, Wageningen University and Research, 2017, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Althusser, the "subject" is an [[Ideology|ideological]] construction (more exactly, constructed by the "[[Louis Althusser#Ideological state apparatuses|Ideological State Apparatuses]]"). One's subjectivity exists, "always already" and is discovered through the process of [[Interpellation (philosophy)|interpellation]]. Ideology inaugurates one into being a subject, and every ideology is intended to maintain and glorify its idealized subject, as well as the metaphysical category of the subject itself (see [[antihumanism]]). 

According to Foucault, it is the "effect" of [[power (sociology)#Foucault|power]] and "[[disciplinary institutions|disciplines]]" (see ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'': construction of the subject ('''subjectivation'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; or '''subjectification''', {{lang-fr|assujettissement}}) as student, soldier, "criminal", etc.). Foucault believed it was possible to transform oneself; he used the word '''''ethopoiein'''''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; from the word ''ethos'' to describe the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Foucault | first = Michel | title = The hermeneutics of the subject : lectures at the Collège de France, 1981-1982 | publisher = Picador | location = New York | year = 2006 | pages= 237 | isbn = 9780312425708 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjectification was a central concept in [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]'s work as well.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Genosko (ed.), ''Deleuze and Guattari: Deleuze and Guattari'', Routledge, 2001, p. 1315.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy==
In contemporary [[analytic philosophy]], the issue of subject—and more specifically the "point of view" of the subject, or "subjectivity"—has received attention as one of the major intractable problems in [[philosophy of mind]] (a related issue being the [[mind–body problem]]). In the essay "[[What is it like to be a bat?]]", [[Thomas Nagel]] famously argued that explaining [[subjective experience]]—the "what it is like" to be something—is currently beyond the reach of scientific inquiry, because scientific understanding by definition requires an objective perspective, which, according to Nagel, is diametrically opposed to the subjective first-person point of view. Furthermore, one cannot have a definition of objectivity without being connected to subjectivity in the first place since they are mutual and interlocked.

In Nagel's book ''[[The View From Nowhere]]'', he asks: "What kind of fact is it that I am Thomas Nagel?". Subjects have a perspective but each subject has a unique perspective and this seems to be a fact in Nagel's view from nowhere (i.e. the birds-eye view of the objective description in the universe). The Indian view of "Brahman" suggests that the ultimate and fundamental subject is existence itself, through which each of us as it were "looks out" as an aspect of a frozen and timeless everything, experienced subjectively due to our separated sensory and memory apparati. These additional features of subjective experience are often referred to as ''[[qualia]]'' (see [[Frank Cameron Jackson]] and [[Mary's room]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27316">The environmental '''[[sustainability]]''' problem has proven difficult to solve. The modern [[environmental movement]] has attempted to solve the problem in a large variety of ways. But little progress has been made, as shown by severe [[ecological footprint]] overshoot and lack of sufficient progress on the [[climate change]] problem. Something within the human system is preventing change to a sustainable mode of behavior. That system trait is '''systemic change resistance'''. Change resistance is also known as organizational resistance, barriers to change, or policy resistance.&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, "Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, pp 5-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of resistance to solving the sustainability problem==

While environmentalism had long been a minor force in political change, the movement strengthened significantly in the 1970s with the first [[Earth Day]] in 1970, in which over 20 million people participated, with publication of ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'' in 1972, and with the first [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] in Stockholm in 1972. Early expectations the problem could be solved ran high. 114 out of 132 members of the United Nations attended the Stockholm conference. The conference was widely seen at the time as a harbinger of success:&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Encyclopedia, Second Edition, W. P. Cunningham et al., editors, 1998, page 1054.&lt;/ref&gt;

: "Many believe the most important result of the conference was the precedent it set for international cooperation in addressing environmental degradation. The nations attending agreed they shared responsibility for the quality of the environment, particularly the oceans and the atmosphere, and they signed a declaration of principles, after extensive negotiations, concerning their obligations. The conference also approved an environmental fund and an ‘action program,’ which involved 200 specific recommendations for addressing such problems as global climate change, [[marine pollution]], population growth, the dumping of toxic wastes, and the preservation of biodiversity. A permanent environment unit was established for coordinating these and other international efforts. [This later became] the United Nations Environmental Program [which was] was formally approved by the General Assembly later that same year and its base established in Nairobi, Kenya. This organization not only coordinated action but monitored research, collecting and disseminating information, and it has played an ongoing role in international negotiations about environmental issues.

:"The conference in Stockholm accomplished almost everything the preparatory committed had planned. It was widely considered successful, and many observers were almost euphoric about the extent of agreement."

However, despite the work of a worldwide [[environmental movement]], many national environmental protection agencies, creation of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]], and many international environmental treaties, the sustainability problem continues to grow worse. The latest [[ecological footprint]] data shows the world’s footprint increased from about 50% ''undershoot'' in 1961 to 50% ''overshoot'' in 2007, the last year data is available.&lt;ref&gt;John Talbert et al., The Genuine Progress Indicator 2006, A Tool for Sustainable Development, Redefining Progress, The Nature of Economics, 2006, available at [http://www.rprogress.org/publications/2007/GPI%202006.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 the first edition of ''The Limits to Growth'' analyzed the environmental sustainability problem using a [[system dynamics]] model. The widely influential book predicted that:&lt;ref&gt;"The Limits to Growth", Meadows et al., 1972, p23.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"If the present trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years. The most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity some time in the 21st century."

Yet thirty-two years later in 2004 the third edition reported that:&lt;ref&gt;"Limits to Growth", Meadows et al., 2004, p xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"[The second edition of Limits to Growth] was published in 1992, the year of the global summit on environment and development in Rio de Janeiro. The advent of the summit seemed to prove that global society had decided to deal seriously with the important environmental problems. But we now know that humanity failed to achieve the goals of Rio. The Rio plus 10 conference in Johannesburg in 2002 produced even less; it was almost paralyzed by a variety of ideological and economic disputes, [due to] the efforts of those pursuing their narrow national, corporate, or individual self-interests.

:"...humanity has largely squandered the past 30 years."

Change resistance runs so high that the world’s top two greenhouse gas emitters, [[China]] and the [[United States]], have never adopted the [[Kyoto Protocol]] treaty. In the US resistance was so strong that in 1999 the US Senate voted 95 to zero against the treaty by passing the [[Byrd–Hagel Resolution]], despite the fact [[Al Gore]] was vice-president at the time. Not a single senator could be persuaded to support the treaty, which has not been brought back to the floor since.

Due to prolonged change resistance, the climate change problem has escalated to the climate change crisis. [[Greenhouse gas]] emissions are rising much faster than [[IPCC]] models expected: “The growth rate of [fossil fuel] emissions was 3.5% per year for 2000-2007, an almost four fold increase from 0.9% per year in 1990-1999. … This makes current trends in emissions higher than the worst case IPCC-SRES scenario.” &lt;ref&gt;"Emissions rising faster this decade than last", CISIRO Media Release, September 25, 2008, available at [http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/global/pdf/Press%20Release_CSIRO_Australia_final.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Copenhagen Climate Summit]] of December 2009 ended in failure.&lt;ref name="Hartwell"&gt;"The Hartwell Paper", Prins, Gwrn et al., May 2010, available at [http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/27939/1/HartwellPaper_English_version.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; No agreement on binding targets was reached. The [[Cancun climate summit|Cancun Climate Summit]] in December 2010 did not break the deadlock. The best it could do was another non-binding agreement:&lt;ref&gt;Outcome of the work of the Ad Hoc Working Group on long-term Cooperative Action under the Convention, 2010, available at [http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_16/application/pdf/cop16_lca.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:“Recognizing that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet, and thus requires to be urgently addressed by all Parties.”

This indicates no progress at all since 1992, when the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] was created at the [[Earth Summit]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. The 2010 Cancun agreement was the functional equivalent of what the 1992 agreement said:&lt;ref&gt;''United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change'', United Nations, 1992, p2-4, available at [http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/convkp/conveng.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The Parties to this Convention... [acknowledge] that the global nature of climate change calls for the widest possible cooperation by all countries and their participation in an effective and appropriate international response.... [thus the parties recognize] that States should enact effective environmental legislation... [to] protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind...."

Negotiations have bogged down so pervasively that: “Climate policy is gridlocked, and there’s virtually no chance of a breakthrough.” &lt;ref&gt;“Disaster at the Top of the World”, Thomas Homer-Dixon, New York Times, August 22, 2010, available at [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/opinion/23homer-dixon.html?_r=1&amp;hp=&amp;pagewanted=all].&lt;/ref&gt; “Climate policy, as it has been understood and practised by many governments of the world under the Kyoto Protocol approach, has failed to produce any discernible real world reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases in fifteen years.” &lt;ref name="Hartwell" /&gt;

These events suggest that change resistance to solving the sustainability problem is so high the problem is currently unsolvable.

==The change resistance and proper coupling subproblems==

Understanding change resistance requires seeing it as a distinct and separate part of the sustainability problem. Tanya Markvart’s 2009 thesis on ''Understanding Institutional Change and Resistance to Change Towards Sustainability'' stated that:&lt;ref name="Markvart"&gt;Tanya I. Markvart, ''Understanding Institutional Change and Resistance to Change Towards Sustainability: An Interdisciplinary Theoretical Framework and Illustrative Application to Provincial-Municipal Aggregates Policy'', 2009, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, pages 4, iii, and 157. Available at [http://www.environment.uwaterloo.ca/research/biosphere/Documents/Markvart_Tanya_000.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:"It has also been demonstrated that ecologically destructive and inequitable institutional systems can be highly resilient and resistant to change, even in the face of social-ecological degradation and/or collapse (e.g., Berkes &amp; Folke, 2002; Allison &amp; Hobbs, 2004; Brown, 2005; Runnalls, 2008; Finley, 2009; Walker et al., 2009)."

The thesis focuses specifically on developing “an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for understanding institutional change and resistance to change towards sustainability.”

Jack Harich's 2010 paper on ''Change Resistance as the Crux of the Environmental Sustainability Problem'' argues there are two separate problems to solve.&lt;ref name="Harich"&gt;Jack Harich, [http://www.thwink.org/sustain/articles/009/ChangeResistanceAsCrux.htm “Change Resistance as the Crux of the Environmental Sustainability Problem”], ''System Dynamics Review'', January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[root cause analysis]] and a [[system dynamics]] model were used to explain how:

:"...difficult social problems [like sustainability must be decomposed] into two sequential subproblems: (1) ''How to overcome change resistance'' and then (2) ''How to achieve proper coupling''. This is the timeless strategy of divide and conquer. By cleaving one big problem into two, the problem becomes an order of magnitude easier to solve, because we can approach the two subproblems differently and much more appropriately. We are no longer unknowingly attempting to solve two very different problems simultaneously."

The paper discussed the two subproblems:

: "''Change resistance'' is the tendency for a system to continue its current behavior, despite the application of force to change that behavior.

: "''Proper coupling'' occurs when the behavior of one system affects the behavior of other systems in a desirable manner, using the appropriate [[feedback loops]], so the systems work together in harmony in accordance with design objectives. … In the environmental sustainability problem the human system has become improperly coupled to the greater system it lives within: the environment.

:"Change resistance versus proper coupling allows a crucial distinction. Society is aware of the proper practices required to live sustainably and the need to do so. But society has a strong aversion to adopting these practices. As a result, problem solvers have created thousands of effective (and often ingenious) proper practices. But they are stymied in their attempts to have them taken up by enough of the system to solve the problem because an 'implicit system goal' is causing insurmountable change resistance. ''Therefore systemic change resistance is the crux of the problem and must be solved first.''"
 
The proper coupling subproblem is what most people consider as “the” problem to solve. It is called [[Decoupling (organizational studies)|decoupling]] in economic and environmental fields, where the term refers to economic growth without additional environmental degradation. Solving the proper coupling problem is the goal of environmentalism and in particular [[ecological economics]]: “Ecological economics is the study of the interactions and co-evolution in time and space of human economies and the ecosystems in which human economies are embedded.” &lt;ref&gt;The New Pelgrave Dictionary of Economics Online, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000221&amp;edition=current&amp;q=ecological%20economics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1/ abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;

Change resistance is also called barriers to change. Hoffman and Bazerman, in a chapter on “Understanding and overcoming the organizational and psychological barriers to action,” concluded that:&lt;ref&gt;"Organizations and the Sustainability Mosaic: Crafting Long-Term Ecological and Societal Solutions", Sharma, S. et al., (Ed), 2007. Chapter 4, Hoffman, A. J., and Bazerman, M. H., "Changing practice on sustainability: Understanding and overcoming the organizational and psychological barriers to action," p85.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In this chapter, we argue that the change in thinking required of the sustainability agenda will never come to fruition within practical domains unless proper attention is given to the sources of individual and social resistance to such change. The implementation of wise management practices cannot be accomplished without a concurrent set of strategies for surmounting these barriers."

[[John Sterman]], current leader of the system dynamics school of thought, came to the same conclusion:&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, 2008. "Risk Communication on Climate Change: Mental Models and Mass Balance." ''Science'', October 2008, vol. 322, no. 5901, pp 532-533.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The civil rights movement provides a better analogy for the climate challenge. Then, as now, entrenched special interests vigorously opposed change. … Of course, we need more research and technical innovation—money and genius are always in short supply. But there is no purely technical solution for climate change. For public policy to be grounded in the hard-won results of climate science, we must now turn our attention to the dynamics of social and political change."

These findings indicate there are at least two subproblems to be solved: change resistance and proper coupling. Given the human system’s long history of unsuccessful attempts to self-correct to a sustainable mode, it appears that high change resistance is preventing proper coupling. This may be expressed as an emerging principle: systemic change resistance is the crux of the sustainability problem and must be solved first, before the human system can be properly coupled to the greater system it lives within, the environment.

==Systemic versus individual change resistance==

Systemic change resistance differs significantly from individual change resistance. “Systemic means originating from the system in such a manner as to affect the behavior of most or all social agents of certain types, as opposed to originating from individual agents.” &lt;ref name="Harich" /&gt; Individual change resistance originates from individual people and organizations. How the two differ may be seen in this passage:&lt;ref&gt;Dent, Eric and Goldberg, Susan. 1999. ''Challenging Resistance to Change'', The Journal of Applied Behavioral Science, Vol. 35, No. 1, 25-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The notion of resistance to change is credited to Kurt Lewin. His conceptualization of the phrase, however, is very different from today’s usage. [which treats resistance to change as a psychological concept, where resistance or support of change comes from values, habits, mental models, and so on residing within the individual] For Lewin, resistance to change could occur, but that resistance could be anywhere in the system. As Kotter (1995) found, ''it is possible for the resistance to be sited within the individual, but it is much more likely to be found elsewhere in the system. ''

:"Systems of social roles, with their associated patterns of attitudes, expectations, and behavior norms, share with biological systems the characteristic of homeostasis—i.e., tendencies to resist change, to restore the previous state after a disturbance.

:"Lewin had been working on this idea, that the status quo represented an equilibrium between the barriers to change and the forces favoring change, since 1928 as part of his field theory. He believed that some difference in these forces—weakening of the barriers or strengthening of the driving forces—was required to produce the unfreezing that began a change."

If sources of systemic change resistance are present, they are the principal cause of individual change resistance. According to the [[fundamental attribution error]] it is crucial to address systemic change resistance when present and avoid assuming that change resistance can be overcome by bargaining, reasoning, inspirational appeals, and so on. This is because:&lt;ref&gt;John Sterman, "Business Dynamics: Systems Thinking and Modeling for a Complex World, 2000, p28.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"A fundamental principle of system dynamics states that the structure of the system gives rise to its behavior. However, people have a strong tendency to attribute the behavior of others to dispositional rather than situational factors, that is, to character and especially character flaws rather than the system in which these people are acting. The tendency to blame the person rather than the system is so strong psychologists call it the 'fundamental attribution error.' "

[[Peter Senge]], a thought leader of [[systems thinking]] for the business world, describes the structural source of systemic change resistance as being due to an “implicit system goal:” &lt;ref&gt;Peter Senge, ''The Fifth Discipline'', 1990, p88.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"In general, balancing loops are more difficult to see than reinforcing loops because it often looks like nothing is happening. There’s no dramatic growth of sales and marketing expenditures, or nuclear arms, or lily pads. Instead, the balancing process maintains the status quo, even when all participants want change. The feeling, as Lewis Carroll’s Queen of Hearts put it, of needing ‘all the running you can do to keep in the same place’ is a clue that a balancing loop may exist nearby.

:"Leaders who attempt organizational change often find themselves unwittingly caught in balancing processes. To the leaders, it looks as though their efforts are clashing with sudden resistance that seems to come from nowhere. In fact, as my friend found when he tried to reduce burnout, the resistance is a response by the system, trying to maintain an ''implicit system goal''. Until this goal is recognized, the change effort is ''doomed to failure.''"

Senge’s insight applies to the sustainability problem. Until the “implicit system goal” causing systemic change resistance is found and resolved, change efforts to solve the proper coupling part of the sustainability problem may be, as Senge argues, “doomed to failure.”

==The current focus is on proper coupling==

Presently environmentalism is focused on solving the proper coupling subproblem. For example, the following are all proper coupling solutions. They attempt to solve the direct cause of the sustainability problem’s symptoms:
* The [[Kyoto Protocol]]
* The [[Waste hierarchy|Three Rs]] of reduce, reuse, recycle
* More use of [[renewable energy]]
* Better [[pollution control]] of many kinds
* Collective management of [[common-pool resources]]
* Certification programs to reduce deforestation such as [[Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification|PEFC]] and [[Forest Stewardship Council|FSC]]
* [[Contour farming]] to reduce soil erosion
* The [[green revolution]]
* [[Zero population growth]]

The direct cause of environmental impact is the three factors on the right side of the [[I PAT|I=PAT equation]] where '''I'''mpact equals '''P'''opulation times '''A'''ffluence (consumption per person) times '''T'''echnology (environmental impact per unit of consumption). It is these three factors that solutions like those listed above seek to reduce.

The top environmental organization in the world, the [[United Nations Environmental Programme]] (UNEP), focuses exclusively on proper coupling solutions:&lt;ref&gt;UNEP 2010 Annual Report, p8, Available at [http://www.unep.org/annualreport/2010/pdfs/UNEP-AR-2010-FULL-REPORT.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

:"2010 marked the beginning of a period of new, strategic and transformational direction for UNEP as it began implementing its Medium Term Strategy (MTS) for 2010-2013 across six areas: Climate change; Disasters and conflicts; Ecosystem management; Environmental governance; Harmful substances and hazardous waste; Resource efficiency, Sustainable consumption and production."

The six areas are all direct practices to reduce the three factors of the I=PAT equation.
 
[[Al Gore]]s' 2006 documentary film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' described the climate change problem and the urgency of solving it. The film concluded with Gore saying:

:"Each one of us is a cause of global warming, but each one of us can make choices to change that with the things we buy, the electricity we use, the cars we drive; we can make choices to bring our individual carbon emissions to zero. The solutions are in our hands, ''we just have to have the determination to make it happen. We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions, everything but political will. '' But in America, the will to act is a renewable resource."

The four solutions Gore mentions are proper coupling practices. There is, however, a hint of acknowledgement that overcoming systemic change resistance is the real challenge, when Gore says “...we just have to have the determination to make it happen. We have everything that we need to reduce carbon emissions, everything but political will.”

The twenty-seven solutions that appear during the film’s closing credits are mostly proper coupling solutions. The first nine are:&lt;ref&gt;''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'': Closing Credits, available at [http://www.folklib.net/index/wi/ait_closing_credits.shtml].&lt;/ref&gt;

* Go to [http://www.climatecrisis.net www.climatecrisis.net]
* You can reduce your carbon emissions. In fact, you can even reduce your carbon emissions to zero.
* Buy energy efficient appliances &amp; light bulbs.
* Change your thermostat (and use clock thermostats) to reduce energy for heating &amp; cooling.
* Weatherize your house, increase insulation, get an energy audit.
* Recycle.
* If you can, buy a hybrid car.
* When you can, walk or ride a bicycle.
* Where you can, use light rail &amp; mass transit.

Some solutions are attempts to overcome individual change resistance, such as:

* Tell your parents not to ruin the world that you will live in.
* If you are a parent, join with your children to save the world they will live in.
* Vote for leaders who pledge to solve this crisis.
* Write to congress. If they don’t listen, run for congress.
* Speak up in your community.

However none of the twenty-seven solutions deal with overcoming systemic change resistance.

==Overcoming systemic change resistance==

Efforts here are sparse because environmentalism is currently not oriented toward treating systemic change resistance as a distinct and separate problem to solve.

On how to specifically overcome the change resistance subproblem, Markvart examined two leading theories that seemed to offer insight into change resistance, [[Panarchy]] theory and [[New institutionalism|New Institutionalism]], and concluded that:&lt;ref name="Markvart" /&gt;

:"...neither theory devotes significant attention to understanding the dynamics of resilient and resistant but inefficient and/or unproductive institutional and ecological systems. Overall, more research is required...."

Taking a [[root cause analysis]] and [[system dynamics]] modeling approach, Harich carefully defined the three characteristics of a [[root cause]] and then found a main systemic root cause for both the change resistance and proper coupling subproblems.&lt;ref name="Harich" /&gt; Several sample solution elements for resolving the root causes were suggested. The point was made that the exact solution policies chosen do not matter nearly as much as finding the correct systemic root causes. Once these are found, how to resolve them is relatively obvious because once a root cause is found by structural modeling, the high leverage point for resolving it follows easily. Solutions may then push on specific structural points in the social system, which due to careful modeling will have fairly predictable effects.

This reaffirms the work of [[Donella Meadows]], as expressed in her classic essay on [[Twelve leverage points|Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System]]. The final page stated that:

:"The higher the leverage point, the more the system will resist changing it."

Here Meadows refers to the leverage point for resolving the proper coupling subproblem rather than the leverage point for overcoming change resistance. This is because the current focus of environmentalism is on proper coupling.

However, if the leverage points associated with the root causes of change resistance exist and can be found, the system will not resist changing them. This is an important principle of social system behavior.

For example, Harich found the main root cause of successful systemic change resistance to be high "deception effectiveness." The source was special interests, particularly large for-profit corporations. The high leverage point was raising "general ability to detect manipulative deception." This can be done with a variety of solution elements, such as "The Truth Test." This effectively increases truth literacy, just as conventional education raises reading and writing [[literacy]]. Few citizens resist literacy education because its benefits have become so obvious.

Promotion of [[corporate social responsibility]] (CSR) has been used to try to overcome change resistance to solving social problems, including environmental sustainability. This solution strategy has not worked well because it is voluntary and does not resolve root causes. [[Milton Friedman]] explained why CSR fails: "The social responsibility of business is to increase profits." &lt;ref&gt;"The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits", Milton Friedman, September 13, 1970, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', available at [http://www.colorado.edu/studentgroups/libertarians/issues/friedman-soc-resp-business.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Business cannot be responsible to society. It can only be responsible to its shareholders.

In psychology, '''temperament''' broadly refers to consistent individual differences in behavior that are biologically based and are relatively independent of learning, system of values and attitudes. Some researchers point to association of temperament with formal dynamical features of behavior, such as energetic aspects, plasticity, sensitivity to specific reinforcers and emotionality.&lt;ref name=Tro&amp;Rusal/&gt; Temperament traits (such as Neuroticism, Sociability, Impulsivity, etc.) remain its distinct patterns in behavior throughout adulthood but they are most noticeable and most studied in children. Babies are typically described by temperament, but longitudinal research in the 1920s began to establish temperament as something which is stable across the lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedman, Schustack|first1=Howard S., Miriam W.|title=Personality: Classic Theories and Modern Research|date=2016|publisher=Pearson Education|location=USA|isbn=9780133829808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a broad definition of temperament is agreed upon, many classification schemes for temperament have been developed, and there is no consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kagan|first1=Jerome|title=Temperament|url=http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/temperament/according-experts/temperament|website=Encyclopedia of Early Childhood Development|publisher=Encyclopedia of Early Childhood Development|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FET/&gt;

Historically, the concept of temperament (originally "temperamentums" in Latin means "mixtures") was a part of the theory of [[the four humors]], with their corresponding [[The four temperaments|four temperaments]].

This historical concept was explored by [[philosopher]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[psychiatrist]]s and psycho-physiologists from very early times of psychological science, with theories proposed by [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Hermann Lotze]], [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[Carl Jung]], [[Gerardus Heymans]] among others.

More recently, scientists seeking evidence of a biological basis of personality have further examined the relationship between temperament and [[neurotransmitter system]]s&lt;ref&gt;Depue, R. &amp; Fu, Y. (2012) Neurobiology and neurochemistry of temperament in adults. In: Zentner, M. &amp; Shiner, R. (Eds.) Handbook of Temperament. NY: Guilford Publications, 368-399.

However, biological correlations have proven hard to confirm.&lt;ref name=Kagan/&gt;

==History and overview==
Temperament is determined through specific behavioral profiles, usually focusing on those that are both easily measurable and testable early in childhood. Commonly tested factors include traits related to energetic capacities (named as "Activity", "Endurance", "Extraversion"), traits related to emotionality (such as irritability, frequency of smiling), and approach or avoidance of unfamiliar events.&lt;ref name=Kagan&gt;{{citation|author=Jerome Kagan|title=Encyclopedia on Early Childhood Development|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FET/&gt; There is generally a low correlation between descriptions by teachers and behavioral observations by scientists of features used in determining temperament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=14669903 |jstor=3696311|year=2003|last1=Bishop|first1=G|title=Can parents and teachers provide a reliable and valid report of behavioral inhibition?|journal=Child Development|volume=74|issue=6|pages=1899–917|last2=Spence|first2=S. H|last3=McDonald|first3=C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperament is hypothesized to be associated with biological factors, but these have proven to be complex and diverse.&lt;ref name=Kagan/&gt;&lt;ref name=FET/&gt;

Historically, in the second century A.D., the physician [[Galen]] described four temperaments (melancholic, phlegmatic, sanguine and choleric) based upon the [[four humours]] or bodily fluids. These became known as the [[four humours|four classical temperaments]]. In more recent history, [[Rudolf Steiner]] had emphasized the importance of the [[four humours|four classical temperaments]] in elementary education, the time when he believed the influence of temperament on the personality to be at its strongest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/FourTemps/ForTem_index.html|title=The Four Temperaments: Lecture in Berlin|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf |year=1909|accessdate=2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|title=The Four Temperaments|isbn=978-0-910142-11-3|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Galen nor Steiner are generally applied to the contemporary study of temperament in the approaches of modern medicine or contemporary psychology.

== Main models ==

===Rusalov-Trofimova neurophysiological model of temperament===

This model is based on the longest tradition of neurophysiological experiments started within the investigations of types and properties of nervous systems by [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s school. This experimental tradition started on studies with animals in 1910-20s but expanded its methodology to humans since 1930s and especially since 1960s, including EEG, caffeine tests, evoked potentials, behavioral tasks and other psychophysiological methods.&lt;ref name=Rusal2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rusalov |first1=Vladimir |title=Functional systems theory and the activity-specific approach in psychological taxonomies |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |date=26 February 2018 |volume=373 |issue=1744 |pages=20170166 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2017.0166|pmid=29483350 |pmc=5832690 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest version of this model is based on the "[[Activity-specific approach in temperament research]], on [[Alexander Luria]]'s research in clinical neurophysiology and on the neurochemical model [[Functional Ensemble of Temperament]].&lt;ref name=FET/&gt;&lt;ref name=TroRob/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tro2018/&gt; At the present time the model is associated with the [[Structure of Temperament Questionnaire]] and has 12 scales:

====Endurance-related scales====
* Motor-physical Endurance: the ability of an individual to sustain prolonged physical activity using well-defined behavioral elements
* Social-verbal Endurance (sociability): the ability of an individual to sustain prolonged social-verbal activities using well-defined behavioral elements.
* Mental Endurance, or Attention: the ability to stay focused on selected features of objects with suppression of behavioral reactivity to other features.

====Scales related to speed of integration of behavior====
* Motor-physical Tempo: speed of integration of an action in physical manipulations with objects with well-defined scripts of actions
* Plasticity: the ability to adapt quickly to changes in situations, to change the program of action, and to shift between different tasks
* Social-verbal Tempo: the preferred speed of speech and ability to understand fast speech on well-known topics, reading and sorting of known verbal material

====Scales related to type of orientation of behavior====
* Sensation Seeking (SS): behavioral orientation to well-defined and existing sensational objects and events, underestimation of outcomes of risky behaviour.
* Empathy: behavioral orientation to the emotional states/needs of others (ranging from empathic deafness in autism and schizophrenia disorders to social dependency).
* Sensitivity to Probabilities: the drive to gather information about uniqueness, frequency and values of objects/events, to differentiate their specific features, to project these features in future actions.

====Emotionality scales====
* Satisfaction (Self-Confidence): A disposition to be satisfied with current state of events, a sense of security, confidence in the future. In spite of the optimism about outcomes of his or her activities, the respondent might be negligent in details.
* Impulsivity: Initiation of actions based on immediate emotional reactivity rather than by planning or rational reasoning.
* Neuroticism: A tendency to avoid novelty, unpredictable situations and uncertainty. Preference of well-known settings and people over unknown ones and a need for approval and feedback from people around.

===Kagan's research===

[[Jerome Kagan]] and his colleagues have concentrated empirical research on a temperamental category termed "reactivity." Four-month-old infants who became "motorically aroused and distressed" to presentations of novel stimuli were termed ''highly reactive''. Those who remained "motorically relaxed and did not cry or fret to the same set of unfamiliar events" were termed ''low reactive''.&lt;ref name=Kagan2&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/1131931 | last1 = Kagan | first1 = J. | year = 1997 | title = Temperament and the reactions to unfamiliarity| journal = Child Development | volume = 68 | issue = 1| pages = 139–143 | pmid = 9084130 | jstor = 1131931 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These high and low reactive infants were tested again at 14 and 21 months "in a variety of unfamiliar laboratory situations." Highly reactive infants were predominantly characterized by a profile of high fear to unfamiliar events, which Kagan termed inhibited. Contrastingly, low reactive children were minimally fearful to novel situations, and were characterized by an uninhibited profile (Kagan). However, when observed again at age 4.5, only a modest proportion of children maintained their expected profile due to mediating factors such as intervening family experiences. Those who remained highly inhibited or uninhibited after age 4.5 were at higher risk for developing anxiety and conduct disorders, respectively.&lt;ref name=Kagan/&gt;

Kagan also used two additional classifications, one for infants who were inactive but cried frequently (distressed) and one for those who showed vigorous activity but little crying (aroused). Followed to age 14–17 years, these groups of children showed differing outcomes, including some differences in central nervous system activity. Teenagers who had been classed as high reactives when they were babies were more likely to be "subdued in unfamiliar situations, to report a dour mood and anxiety over the future, [and] to be more religious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=30163598|title=The Preservation of Two Infant Temperaments into Adolescence|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=72|issue=2|pages=i–95|last1=Kagan|first1=Jerome|last2=Snidman|first2=Nancy|last3=Kahn|first3=Vali|last4=Towsley|first4=Sara|last5=Steinberg|first5=Laurence|last6=Fox|first6=Nathan A|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thomas and Chess's nine temperament characteristics===

Alexander Thomas, [[Stella Chess]], Herbert G. Birch, Margaret Hertzig and Sam Korn began the classic New York Longitudinal study in the early 1950s regarding infant temperament (Thomas, Chess &amp; Birch, 1968). The study focused on how temperamental qualities influence adjustment throughout life. Chess, Thomas et al. rated young infants on nine temperament characteristics, each of which, by itself, or with connection to another, affects how well a child fits in at school, with their friends, and at home. Behaviors for each one of these traits are on a [[Continuum (measurement)|continuum]]. If a child leans towards the high or low end of the scale, it could be a cause for concern. The specific behaviors are: activity level, regularity of [[sleep]]ing and [[eating]] patterns, initial reaction, adaptability, intensity of [[emotion]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], distractibility, persistence and [[attention span]], and sensory sensitivity. Redundancies between the categories have been found and a reduced list is normally used by psychologists today.&lt;ref name=IReview&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marcel |first1=Zentner, |last2=E. |first2=Bates, John |title=Child Temperament: An Integrative Review of Concepts, Research Programs, and Measures |journal=International Journal of Developmental Science |date=1 January 2008 |volume=2 |issue=1–2 |citeseerx=10.1.1.598.1517 |doi=10.3233/DEV-2008-21203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 65% of children fit one of the patterns. Of the 65%, 40% fit the easy pattern, 10% fell into the difficult pattern, and 15% were slow to warm up. Each category has its own strength and weakness and one is not superior to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rookieparenting.com/raising-children-temperament-personality/ | title=Raising Children – Temperament and Personality | publisher=Rookie Parenting | date=29 September 2014 | accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas, Chess, Birch, Hertzig and Korn showed that ''easy'' babies readily adapt to new experiences, generally display positive moods and emotions and also have normal eating and sleeping patterns. ''Difficult'' babies tend to be very emotional, irritable and fussy, and cry a lot. They also tend to have irregular eating and sleeping patterns. ''Slow-to-warm-up'' babies have a low activity level, and tend to withdraw from new situations and people. They are slow to adapt to new experiences, but accept them after repeated exposure.

Thomas, Chess, Birch, Hertzig and Korn found that these broad patterns of temperamental qualities are remarkably stable through childhood. These traits are also found in children across all cultures.

Thomas and Chess also studied temperament and environment. One sample consisted of white middle-class families with high educational status and the other was of Puerto Rican working-class families. They found several differences. Among those were:&lt;ref name=psychpage/&gt;

- Parents of middle class children were more likely to report behavior problems before the age of nine and the children had sleep problems. This may be because children start preschool between the ages of three and four. Puerto Rican children under the age of five showed rare signs of sleep problems, however, sleep problems became more common at the age of six.
- Middle class parents also placed great stress on the child’s early development, believing that problems in early ages were indicative of later problems in psychological development, whereas Puerto Rican parents felt their children would outgrow any problems.
- At the age of nine, the report of new problems dropped for middle class children but they rose in Puerto Rican children, possibly due to the demands of school.

Observed traits:

* Activity: refers to the child's physical energy. Is the child constantly moving, or does the child have a relaxing approach? A high-energy child may have difficulty sitting still in class, whereas a child with low energy can tolerate a very structured environment. The former may use gross motor skills like running and jumping more frequently. Conversely, a child with a lower activity level may rely more on fine motor skills, such as drawing and putting puzzles together. This trait can also refer to mental activity, such as deep thinking or reading&amp;mdash;activities which become more significant as the person matures.
* Regularity: also known as ''rhythmicity'', refers to the level of predictability in a child’s biological functions, such as waking, becoming tired, hunger, and bowel movements. Does the child have a routine in eating and sleeping habits, or are these events more random?  For example, a child with a high regularity rating may want to eat at 2&amp;nbsp;p.m. every day, whereas a child lower on the regularity scale may eat at sporadic times throughout the day.
* Initial reaction: also known as ''approach or withdrawal''. This refers to how the child responds (whether positively or negatively) to new people or environments. Does the child approach people or things in the environment without hesitation, or does the child shy away? A bold child tends to approach things quickly, as if without thinking, whereas a cautious child typically prefers to watch for a while before engaging in new experiences.
* Adaptability: refers to how long it takes the child to adjust to change over time (as opposed to an initial reaction). Does the child adjust to the changes in their environment easily, or is the child resistant? A child who adjusts easily may be quick to settle into a new routine, whereas a resistant child may take a long time to adjust to the situation.
*Intensity: refers to the energy level of a positive or negative response. Does the child react intensely to a situation, or does the child respond in a calm and quiet manner? A more intense child may jump up and down screaming with excitement, whereas a mild-mannered child may smile or show no emotion.
* Mood: refers to the child’s general tendency towards a happy or unhappy demeanor. All children have a variety of emotions and reactions, such as cheerful and stormy, happy and unhappy. Yet each child biologically tends to have a generally positive or negative outlook. A baby who frequently smiles and coos could be considered a cheerful baby, whereas a baby who frequently cries or fusses might be considered a stormy baby.
*Distractibility: refers to the child’s tendency to be sidetracked by other things going on around them. Does the child get easily distracted by what is happening in the environment, or can the child concentrate despite the interruptions? An easily distracted child is engaged by external events and has difficulty returning to the task at hand, whereas a rarely distracted child stays focused and completes the task at hand.
*Persistence and attention span: refer to the child’s length of time on a task and ability to stay with the task through frustrations—whether the child stays with an activity for a long period of time or loses interest quickly.
*Sensitivity: refers to how easily a child is disturbed by changes in the environment. This is also called '''sensory threshold''' or '''threshold of responsiveness'''. Is the child bothered by external stimuli like noises, textures, or lights, or does the child seem to ignore them? A sensitive child may lose focus when a door slams, whereas a child less sensitive to external noises will be able to maintain focus.

===Mary K. Rothbart’s three dimensions of temperament===
[[Mary K. Rothbart]] views temperament as the individual personality differences in infants and young children that are present prior to the development of higher [[Cognition|cognitive]] and social aspects of [[Personality psychology|personality]].&lt;ref name="Rothbart and Hwang"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rothbart, M.K  |author2=Hwang, J. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Temperament and the development of competence and motivation. In A.J. Elliot &amp; A.C. Dweck (Eds.), Handbook of competence and motivation|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York| year = 2005 |isbn=978-1-59385-606-9|pages=167–184|url=http://www.guilford.com/cgi-bin/cartscript.cgi?page=pr/elliot3.htm&amp;dir=pp/sapp&amp;cart_id=471466.23602}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothbart further defines temperament as individual differences in reactivity and self-regulation that manifest in the domains of emotion, activity and attention. Moving away from classifying infants into categories, Mary Rothbart identified three underlying dimensions of temperament.&lt;ref name="Kail and Barnfield"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kail RV, Barnfield A | title = Children and Their Development, Second Canadian Edition with MyDevelopmentLab | edition = | language = | publisher = Pearson Education Canada | location = Toronto | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-0-13-255770-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using [[factor analysis]] on data from 3 -12 month old children, three broad factors emerged and were labelled surgency/extraversion, negative affect, and effortful control.&lt;ref name="Rothbart and Hwang" /&gt;

====Surgency/extraversion====
[[Surgency]]/extraversion includes positive anticipation, [[impulsivity]], increased levels of activity and a desire for sensation seeking.&lt;ref name="Rothbart in Merrill"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothbart|first=M K|title=Temperament and the pursuit of an integrated developmental psychology|journal=Merrill-Palmer Quarterly|date=Oct 2004|volume=50|issue=4|pages=492–505|url=http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/mpq/vol50/iss4/7|doi=10.1353/mpq.2004.0035}}&lt;/ref&gt; This factor reflects the degree to which a child is generally happy, active, and enjoys vocalizing and seeking stimulation.&lt;ref name="Kail and Barnfield" /&gt; Increased levels of smiling and laughter are observed in babies high in surgency/extraversion.&lt;ref name="Rothbart and Hwang" /&gt; 10- to 11-year-olds with higher levels of surgency/extraversion are more likely to develop externalizing problems like acting out; however, they are less likely to develop internalizing problems such as [[shyness]] and low [[self-esteem]].&lt;ref name=Ormel&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16300695|doi=10.1017/S0033291705005829|year=2005|last1=Ormel|first1=J|title=Internalizing and externalizing problems in adolescence: General and dimension-specific effects of familial loadings and preadolescent temperament traits|journal=Psychological Medicine|volume=35|issue=12|pages=1825–35|last2=Oldehinkel|first2=A.

K|last10=Verhulst|first10=F. C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Negative affect====
Negative affect includes [[fear]], [[frustration]], [[sadness]], discomfort,&lt;ref name="Rothbart in Merrill" /&gt; and [[anger]].&lt;ref name="Rothbart and Hwang" /&gt; This factor reflects the degree to which a child is shy and not easily calmed.&lt;ref name="Kail and Barnfield" /&gt; Anger and frustration is seen as early as 2 to 3 months of age. Anger and frustration, together, predict externalizing and internalizing difficulties. Anger, alone, is later related to externalizing problems, while fear is associated with internalizing difficulties.  Fear as evidenced by behavioural inhibition is seen as early as 7–10 months of age, and later predicts children's fearfulness and lower levels of [[aggression]].&lt;ref name="Rothbart, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothbart|first=M. K.|title=Temperament, development and personality|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=207–212|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2007.00505.x|url=http://brainstormquestions.wikispaces.com/file/view/Rothbart+-+Temperament,+Development+and+Personality.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Effortful control====
Effortful control includes the focusing and shifting of [[attention]], inhibitory control, perceptual sensitivity, and a low threshold for pleasure.&lt;ref name="Rothbart in Merrill" /&gt; This factor reflects the degree to which a child can focus attention, is not easily distracted,&lt;ref name="Kail and Barnfield" /&gt; can restrain a dominant response in order to execute a non-dominant response, and employ planning. When high in effortful control, six- to seven-year-olds tend to be more [[Empathy|empathetic]] and lower in aggressiveness.&lt;ref name="Rothbart in Merrill" /&gt; Higher levels of effortful control at age seven also predict lower externalizing problems at age 11 years.&lt;ref name=Valiente&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14633062|doi=10.1111/1467-6494.7106011|year=2003|last1=Valiente|first1=C|title=The relations of effortful control and reactive control to children's externalizing problems: A longitudinal assessment|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=71|issue=6|pages=1171–96|last2=Eisenberg|first2=N|last3=Smith|first3=C. L|last4=Reiser|first4=M|last5=Fabes|first5=R. A|last6=Losoya|first6=S|last7=Guthrie|first7=I. K|last8=Murphy|first8=B. C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children high on negative affect show decreased internalizing and externalizing problems when they are also high on effortful control.&lt;ref name="Rothbart, 2007" /&gt; Rothbart suggests that effortful control is dependent on the development of executive attention skills in the early years. In turn, executive attention skills allows greater self-control over reactive tendencies. Effortful control shows stability from infancy into the school years&lt;ref name="Rothbart, 2007" /&gt; and also predicts [[conscience]].&lt;ref name="Kochanska et al"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10749079|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.36.2.220|year=2000|last1=Kochanska|first1=G|title=Effortful control in early childhood: Continuity and change, antecedents, and implications for social development|journal=Developmental Psychology|volume=36|issue=2|pages=220–32|last2=Murray|first2=K. T|last3=Harlan|first3=E. T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solomon Diamond described temperaments based upon characteristics found in the animal world: fearfulness, aggressiveness, affiliativeness, and impulsiveness. His work has been carried forward by [[Arnold Buss]] and [[Robert Plomin]], who developed two measures of temperament: The Colorado Child Temperament Inventory, which includes aspects of Thomas and Chess's schema, and the [[EAS Survey for Children]].&lt;ref name=IReview/&gt;

H. Hill Goldsmith and Joseph Campos used emotional characteristics to define temperament, originally analyzing five emotional qualities: motor activity, anger, fearfulness, pleasure/joy, and interest/persistence, but later expanding to include other emotions. They developed several measures of temperament: Lab-TAB and TBAQ.&lt;ref name=IReview/&gt;

Other temperament systems include those based upon theories of adult temperament (e.g. Gray and Martin's Temperament Assessment Battery for Children), or adult personality (e.g.the Big Five personality traits).

==Temperament vs. psychiatric disorders ==

Several psychiatrists and differential psychologists have suggested that temperament and mental illness represent varying degrees along the same continuum of neurotransmitter imbalances in neurophysiological systems of behavioural regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rstb.2017.0168|pmid=29483352|pmc=5832692|title=Assessing the continuum between temperament and affective illness: Psychiatric and mathematical perspectives|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=373|issue=1744|pages=20170168|year=2018|last1=Sulis|first1=W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=4370336|year=2014|last1=Watson|first1=D|title=Personality, Emotions, and the Emotional Disorders|journal=Clinical Psychological Science|volume=2|issue=4|pages=422–442|last2=Naragon-Gainey|first2=K|doi=10.1177/2167702614536162|pmid=25815243}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1186/s12888-018-1695-x|pmid=29747614|pmc=5946468|title=There is more to mental illness than negative affect: Comprehensive temperament profiles in depression and generalized anxiety|journal=BMC Psychiatry|volume=18|issue=1|pages=125|year=2018|last1=Trofimova|first1=I.|last2=Sulis|first2=W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, the original four types of temperament (choleric, melancholic, phlegmatic and sanguine) suggested by [[Hippocrates]] and [[Galen]] resemble mild forms of types of psychiatric disorders described in modern classifications. Moreover, Hippocrates-Galen hypothesis of chemical imbalances as factors of consistent individual differences has also been validated by research in neurochemistry and psychopharmacology, though modern studies attribute this to different compounds. Many studies have examined the relationships between temperament traits (such as impulsivity, sensation seeking, neuroticism, endurance, plasticity, sociability or extraversion) and various neurotransmitter and hormonal systems, (i.e. the very same systems implicated in mental disorders)

Even though temperament and psychiatric disorders can be presented as, correspondingly, weak and strong imbalances within the same regulatory systems, it is incorrect to say that temperament is a weak degree of these disorders. Temperament might be a disposition to develop a mental disorder, but it should not be treated as a guaranteed marker for disorders.

==Family life==

===Influences===
Most experts agree that temperament has a [[genetics|genetic]] and [[biology|biological]] basis, although environmental factors and maturation modify the ways a child's personality is expressed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEU-az-NzTc Development of Temperament Symposium (2008). Philoctetes Center, New York; with panelists Sue Carter, Francis Champagne, [[Susan Coates]], Ed Nercessian, Donald Pfaff, [[Daniel Schechter]], Nadia Bruschweiler Stern]&lt;/ref&gt; The term “goodness of fit” refers to the match or mismatch between temperament and other personal characteristics and the specific features of the environment. Differences of temperament or behavior styles between individuals are important in family life. They affect the interactions among family members. While some children can adapt quickly and easily to family routines and get along with siblings, others who are more active or intense may have a difficult time adjusting. The interactions between these children and their parents or siblings are among a number of factors that can lead to stress and friction within the family.

The temperament mix between parents and children also affects family life.  For example, a slow-paced parent may be irritated by a highly active child; or if both parent and child are highly active and intense, conflict could result. This knowledge can help parents figure out how temperaments affect family relationships. What may appear to be a behavioral problem may actually be a mismatch between the parent’s temperament and their child’s. By taking a closer look at the nine traits that Thomas and Chess revealed from their study, parents can gain a better understanding of their child’s temperament and their own. Parents may also notice that situational factors cause a child's temperament to seem problematic; for example, a child with low rhythmicity can cause difficulties for a family with a highly scheduled life, and a child with a high activity level may be difficult to cope with if the family lives in a crowded apartment upstairs from sensitive neighbors.

Parents can encourage new behaviors in their children, and with enough support a ''slow-to-warm-up'' child can become less shy, or a ''difficult'' baby can become easier to handle. More recently infants and children with temperament issues have been called "spirited" to avoid negative connotations of "''difficult''" and "''slow to warm up''". Numerous books have been written advising parents how to raise their spirited youngsters.

===Understanding for improvement===
Understanding a child’s temperament can help reframe how parents interpret children’s behavior and the way parents think about the reasons for behaviors. By parents having access to this knowledge now helps them to guide their child in ways that respect the child’s individual differences. By understanding children’s temperaments and our own helps adults to work with them rather than try to change them. It is an opportunity to anticipate and understand a child’s reaction. It is also important to know that temperament does not excuse a child’s unacceptable behavior, but it does provide direction to how parents can respond to it. Making small and reasonable accommodations to routines can reduce tension. For example, a child who is slow-paced in the mornings may need an extra half-hour to get ready. Knowing who or what may affect the child’s behavior can help to alleviate potential problems. Although children obtain their temperament behaviors innately, a large part that helps determine a child's ability to develop and act in certain ways is determined by the parents. When a parent takes the time to identify and more importantly respond to the temperaments they are faced with in a positive way it will help them guide their child in trying to figure out the world.

Recognizing the child’s temperament and helping them to understand how it impacts his/her life as well as others is important. It is just as important for parents to recognize their own temperaments. Recognizing each individual’s temperament, will help to prevent and manage problems that may arise from the differences among family members.

Temperament continues into adulthood, and later studies by Chess and Thomas have shown that these characteristics continue to influence behavior and adjustment throughout the life-span.

In addition to the initial clinical studies, academic psychologists have developed an interest in the field and researchers such as Bates, Buss &amp; Plomin, [[Jerome Kagan|Kagan]], [[Vladimir Rusalov|Rusalov]], [[Robert Cloninger|Cloninger]], Trofimova and Rothbart have generated large bodies of research in the areas of [[personality psychology|personality]], [[neuroscience]], and [[behavioural genetics|behavioral genetics]].

'''''The Elements of Style''''' is a [[linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] [[American English]] writing [[style guide]] in numerous editions. The original was composed by [[William Strunk Jr.]], in 1918, and published by Harcourt, in 1920, comprising eight "elementary rules of usage", ten "elementary principles of composition", "a few matters of form", a list of 49 "words and expressions commonly misused", and a list of 57 "words often misspelled". [[E. B. White]] greatly enlarged and revised the book for publication by Macmillan in 1959. That was the first edition of the so-called "'''Strunk &amp; White'''", which ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named in 2011 as one of the 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite web |title=''Elements of Style'' |author=Skarda, Erin |work=All-TIME 100 Nonfiction Books

==History==
[[Cornell University]] [[English studies|English]] professor William Strunk Jr. wrote ''The Elements of Style'' in 1918 and privately published it in 1919, for use at the university. (Harcourt republished it in 52-page format in 1920.)&lt;ref name=LCC1920/&gt; Later, for publication, he and editor Edward A. Tenney revised it as ''The Elements and Practice of Composition'' (1935). In 1957, at ''[[The New Yorker]]'', the style guide reached the attention of [[E.B. White]], who had studied writing under Strunk in 1919 but had since forgotten "the little book" that he described as a "forty-three-page summation of the case for cleanliness, accuracy, and brevity in the use of English".  Weeks later, White wrote a [[feature story]] about Strunk's devotion to lucid English prose.&lt;ref name="Style, p.xiii"&gt;{{cite book|last=Strunk|first=William Jr.|title=The Elements of Style|year=2009|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-205-31342-6 |edition=5th |author2=White, E. B. |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Macmillan and Company]] subsequently commissioned White to revise ''The Elements'' for a 1959 edition (Strunk had died in 1946). White's expansion and modernization of Strunk and Tenney's 1935 revised edition yielded the writing style manual informally known as "'''Strunk &amp; White'''", the first edition of which sold about two million copies in 1959. More than ten million copies of three editions were later sold.&lt;ref&gt;Strunk and White (2009), p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Garvey relates the history of the book in ''Stylized: A Slightly Obsessive History of Strunk &amp; White's The Elements of Style'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garvey, Mark |date=2009|title=Stylized: A Slightly Obsessive History of Strunk &amp; White's The Elements of Style|publisher= Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn= 1-4165-9092-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maira Kalman, who provided the illustrations for ''The Elements of Style Illustrated'' (2005, see below), asked [[Nico Muhly]] to compose a [[cantata]] based on the book. It was performed at the [[New York Public Library]] in October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eicher, Jeremy |date=October 21, 2005|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20051021friday.html |title='Style' Gets New Elements|publisher=LearningNetwork: Teachers|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Neary, Lynn |date=November 2, 2005|url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4985137|title= 'Elements of Style' Goes Beyond Words|work=NPR Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laco.org/composer/359 |title=Nico Muhly |website=[[Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116124639/http://www.laco.org/composer/359 |archivedate=2014-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
In ''The Elements of Style'' (1918), William Strunk concentrated on specific questions of usage—and the cultivation of good writing—with the recommendation "Make every word tell"; hence the 17th principle of composition is the simple instruction: "Omit needless words." The book frames this within a triplet credited to an influential lecturer:

* Omit needless words
* Use [[active voice]]
* Use parallel construction on concepts that are parallel &lt;ref&gt;Strunk and White (2009), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1959 edition features White's expansions of preliminary sections, the "Introduction" essay (derived from his magazine feature story about Prof. Strunk), and the concluding chapter, "An Approach to Style", a broader, prescriptive guide to writing in English. He also produced the second (1972) and third (1979) editions of ''The Elements of Style'', by which time the book's length had extended to 85 pages.

The third edition of ''The Elements of Style'' (1979) features 54 points: a list of common word-usage errors; 11 rules of punctuation and grammar; 11 principles of writing; 11 matters of form; and, in Chapter V, 21 reminders for better style. The final reminder, the 21st, "Prefer the standard to the offbeat", is thematically integral to the subject of ''The Elements of Style'', yet does stand as a discrete essay about writing lucid prose.&lt;ref name="Style, p.xiii" /&gt; To write well, White advises writers to have the proper mind-set, that they write to please themselves, and that they aim for "one moment of felicity", a phrase by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] (1850–94).{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Thus Strunk's 1918 recommendation:

{{quote|Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that he make every word tell. |"Elementary Principles of Composition", ''The Elements of Style''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Strunk |title=The Elements of Style |year=1918}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Strunk Jr.  no longer has a comma in his name in the 1979 and later editions, due to the modernized style recommendation about punctuating such names.

The fourth edition of ''The Elements of Style'' (2000), published 54 years after Strunk's death, omits his stylistic advice about masculine pronouns: "unless the antecedent is or must be feminine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strunk |first = William |author2=E.

Further, the re-titled entry "They. He or She", in Chapter IV: Misused Words and Expressions, advises the writer to avoid an "unintentional emphasis on the masculine".&lt;ref name="Strunk-1999-p60"&gt;{{cite book |last=Strunk |first = William |author2=E.

See also [[gender-specific pronoun]]s.&lt;/ref&gt;

Components new to the fourth edition include a foreword by [[Roger Angell]], stepson of E. B. White, an afterword by the American cultural commentator [[Charles Osgood]], a glossary, and an index. Five years later, the fourth edition text was re-published as ''The Elements of Style Illustrated'' (2005), with illustrations by the designer [[Maira Kalman]]. This edition excludes the afterword by [[Charles Osgood]] and restores the first edition chapter on spelling.

==Reception==
''The Elements of Style'' was listed as one of the 100 best and most influential books written in English since 1923 by ''Time'' in its 2011 list.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Upon its release, Charles Poor, writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', called it "a splendid trophy for all who are interested in reading and writing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/08/03/lifetimes/white-strunk.html |title=Books of the Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1959-06-09 |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; American poet [[Dorothy Parker]] once proclaimed&lt;blockquote&gt;If you have any young friends who aspire to become writers, the second-greatest favor you can do them is to present them with copies of ''The Elements of Style''. The first-greatest, of course, is to shoot them now, while they’re happy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/books/22elem.html|title=‘The Elements of Style’ Turns 50|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Criticism of ''Strunk &amp; White'' has largely focused on claims that it has a [[Linguistic prescriptivism|prescriptivist]] nature, or that it has become a general anachronism in the face of modern English usage.

In criticizing ''The Elements of Style'', [[Geoffrey Pullum]], professor of [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]], and co-author of ''[[The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]]'' (2002), said that: {{quote|The book's toxic mix of purism, atavism, and personal eccentricity is not underpinned by a proper grounding in English grammar. It is often so misguided that the authors appear not to notice their own egregious flouting of its own rules&amp;nbsp;... It's sad. Several generations of college students learned their grammar from the uninformed bossiness of ''Strunk and White'', and the result is a nation of educated people who know they feel vaguely anxious and insecure whenever they write ''however'' or ''than me'' or ''was'' or ''which'', but can't tell you why.&lt;ref name="pullum-50years"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Pullum | first=Geoffrey K. | authorlink=Geoffrey Pullum | date=April 17, 2009 | title=50 Years of Stupid Grammar Advice | journal=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] | volume=55 | issue=32 | pages=B15 | url=http://chronicle.com/article/50-Years-of-Stupid-Grammar/25497 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413043333/https://www.chronicle.com/article/50-Years-of-Stupid-Grammar/25497 | archivedate=2016-04-13 | accessdate=2017-11-27 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pullum has argued, for example, that the authors misunderstood what constitutes the [[English passive voice|passive voice]], and he criticized their proscription of established and unproblematic English usages, such as the [[split infinitive]] and the use of ''which'' in a restrictive [[English relative clause#That or which|relative clause]].&lt;ref name="pullum-50years"/&gt; On ''[[Language Log]]'', a blog about language written by linguists, he further criticized ''The Elements of Style'' for promoting [[linguistic prescriptivism]] and [[hypercorrection]] among [[Anglophones]], and called it "the book that ate America's brain".&lt;ref&gt;Pullum, Geoffrey (2009). "[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1505 Sotomayor loves Strunk and White]" (June 12).  "[http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=1485 Drinking the Strunkian Kool-Aid]" (June 6).

''[[The Boston Globe]]''{{'s}} review described ''The Elements of Style Illustrated'' (2005), with illustrations by Maira Kalman, as an "aging zombie of a book&amp;nbsp;... a hodgepodge, its now-antiquated pet peeves jostling for space with 1970s taboos and 1990s computer advice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2005/10/23/frankenstrunk|title=Frankenstrunk|last=Freeman|first=Jan|date=October 23, 2005|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|accessdate=2009-04-12}} {{subscription required}}&lt;!--2014-05-14--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, in ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft|On Writing]]'' (2000, p.&amp;nbsp;11), [[Stephen King]] writes: "There is little or no detectable bullshit in that book. (Of course, it's short; at eighty-five pages it's much shorter than this one.) I'll tell you right now that every aspiring writer should read The Elements of Style. Rule 17 in the chapter titled Principles of Composition is 'Omit needless words.' I will try to do that here."

In 2011, [[Tim Skern]] wrote that ''The Elements of Style'' "remains the best book available on writing good English".&lt;ref&gt;Skern, Tim (2011). ''Writing Scientific English: A Workbook''. (UTB 3112) Vienna (facultas.wuv). p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Nevile Gwynne]] reproduced ''The Elements of Style'' in his work, ''[[Gwynne's Grammar]]''. Britt Peterson of the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' wrote that it was a "curious addition".&lt;ref&gt;Britt Peterson (31 August 2014). [https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/08/30/why-love-language-police/AL7pZtx1StOOyz5VaeYkPI/story.html "Why we love the language police"]. ''Boston Globe''. Retrieved 09 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Open Syllabus Project &lt;ref&gt;[http://opensyllabusproject.org/faq/]&lt;/ref&gt; lists ''The Elements of Style'' as the most frequently assigned text in US academic syllabi, based on an analysis of 933,635 texts appearing in over 1 million syllabi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://explorer.opensyllabusproject.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cite BAILII|litigants='''The Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime v Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co (Europe) Ltd'''|court=UKSC|year=2016|num=18}} is a [[2016 Judgments of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|2016 judgment]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] that provided an interpretation of section 2 to the [[Riot (Damages) Act 1886]].

==Facts==
The case concerns an incident that took place during the [[2011 England riots]]. On 8 August 2011 a gang broke into a warehouse owned by [[Sony DADC]] in [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]]. After stealing goods from the warehouse they proceeded to start a fire that destroyed the warehouse and the goods that remained inside.

The insurers, [[Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group]], made a claim under section 2 of the [[Riot (Damages) Act 1886]] but a dispute arose surrounding the quantification of loss. The [[Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime|MOPC]] argued that compensation should only extend to the physical damage whereas the insurers argued that it should also include [[consequential damages]].

==Judgment==
===High Court===
The High Court held that section 2 only provided for compensation for the physical damage suffered and not any consequential loss of profits or rent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Comm/2013/2734.html [2013&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWHC 2734 (Comm)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court of Appeal===
The Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the High Court and held that section 2 provided a right to compensation for all heads of loss. The [[Master of the Rolls]], [[John Dyson, Lord Dyson|Lord Dyson]] stated:
{{Quote|text=It does not matter whether consequential losses such as loss of profits were recoverable from a trespasser in tort in 1886. In principle, section 2(1) covers all heads of loss compensable under English law for damage to property caused by trespassers in the course of a riot and the heads of compensation recoverable are to be determined with reference to the English law of damages as it develops over time. |source=Paragraph 123, [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2014/682.html [2014&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; EWCA Civ 682]}}[[File:Double-deck burning in 2011 england riots.jpg|thumb|alt=A double-decker bus burning on Tottenham High Road during the 2011 England riots|The [[2011 England riots|2011 riots]] caused widespread damage across London.]]

===Supreme Court===
In the lead judgment [[Lord Hodge]] emphasised that the [[Riot (Damages) Act 1886]] must be considered in the context of previous legislative history. Compensation following a riot was first provided for by Parliament in the Riot Act 1714 and although the scope of compensation was not defined; subsequent case law made it clear that "statutory compensation was confined to physical damage to property."&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph 30, [https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2014-0165-judgment.pdf [2016&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; UKSC 18]&lt;/ref&gt; On this basis the Supreme Court unanimously allowed the appeal by the [[Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime|MOPC]].

==Aftermath==
In the wake of the [[2011 England riots|2011 riots]] it was felt that the wording of the [[Riot (Damages) Act 1886]] was archaic and therefore created uncertainty as regards interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/8/pdfs/ukpgaen_20160008_en.pdf Explanatory Notes] to the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/8/contents/enacted Riot Compensation Act 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; As such section 10 of the [[Riot Compensation Act 2016]] repealed the [[Riot (Damages) Act 1886]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/8/section/10/enacted Section 10], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/8/contents/enacted Riot Compensation Act 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, section 8(2) of the 2016 Act now makes it clear that compensation will not generally extend to [[consequential damages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/8/section/8/enacted Section 8], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2016/8/contents/enacted Riot Compensation Act 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==
The law firm that represented the [[Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime|MOPC]] in the case stated that "With many claims for consequential loss dependent on the outcome of this case, today's Supreme Court decision will likely save the UK taxpayer upwards of £80m."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-36090993 |title=Mayor Boris Johnson wins London riot compensation case |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=20 April 2016 |website=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=22 April 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thích Quảng Độ''' (born 27 November 1928) is a Vietnamese [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] and patriarch of the [[Unified Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam]], a currently banned religious body in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/burn-02172012185416.html Self-Immolation 'Only Possible Recourse'], RFA, 2012-02-17&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, he was awarded the [[Homo Homini Award]] for human rights activism by the Czech group [[People In Need (Czech Republic)|People In Need]], which he shared with [[Thích Huyền Quang]] and [[Thadeus Nguyễn Văn Lý]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clovekvtisni.cz/index2en.php?id=549|title=Previous Recipients of the Homo Homini Award|publisher=[[People In Need (Czech Republic)|People In Need]]|accessdate=17 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501192644/http://www.clovekvtisni.cz/index2en.php?id=549|archivedate=1 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Thích Quảng Độ was born in the [[Thái Bình Province]] of North Vietnam, at 14 he became a monk. At age 17 he witnessed his religious master executed by the revolutionary People's Tribunal.

===Political opposition===
While a member of the leadership of the UBCV, Thích Quảng Độ became an activist, fighting against the anti-Buddhist policies of [[Ngô Đình Diệm]].  After a police raid of Buddhist monasteries in Hue and Saigon, Quảng Độ was arrested on  August 20, 1963. He and thousands of other Buddhists endured torture and persecution while imprisoned by the Diem government. As a result of imprisonment, Độ struggled with [[tuberculosis]] before having a lung operation.

In 1975 Vietnam was under communist control, and the UBCV was once again unwelcome in Vietnam. As a result, the UBCV facilities were seized, and documents burned. Quảng Độ was active in protesting the governments actions, and after attempting to gather Buddhists from other regions in non-violent opposition, he was arrested on charges of anti-revolutionary activities and undermining national solidarity. He spent  20 months at the Phan Dang Luu Prison in solitary confinement, before he was trialed and released in December, 1978. Later that year  he was nominated by Betty Williams and [[Mairead Maguire]] to receive the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name="Que me"&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile on Most Venerable Thich Quang Do, Head of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam|url=http://www.queme.net/eng/thichquangdo.php|work=Biography|publisher=Que me|accessdate=24 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125093252/http://queme.net/eng/thichquangdo.php|archivedate=25 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the Vietnamese Government created a Buddhist alternative, called the Vietnam Buddhist Church, which was state sponsored and controlled by the [[Vietnam Fatherland Front]].  Because of Quảng Độ's opposition to the new church, he was again jailed. Quảng Độ would spend the next 10 years in exile in the village of Vu Doai.&lt;ref name="Que me" /&gt;

Yet again in 1995, while attempting to expose government abuse of the UBCV, he was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison.

Thích Quảng Độ became the President of the UBCV's Institute for the Dissemination of the Dharma in 1999, meaning that he was the second-ranking UBCV dignitary after patriarch Thich Huyen Quang. In 2008, as one of his last wishes Patriarch Quang named Thích Quảng Độ as the new patriarch of the  Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Que me" /&gt;

==Awards==
In 2001, Thích Quảng Độ received the Hellman-Hammet Award for persecuted writers.

In 2002, Thích Quảng Độ, together with Father Nguyễn Văn Lý, received Vietnam Human Rights Award from Vietnam Human Rights Network.

In 2003, Thích Quảng Độ was honored with the [[Homo Homini Award]] for human rights activism by the Czech group People in Need, which he shared with Thích Huyền Quảng and Father Nguyễn Văn Lý.&lt;ref&gt; Martin Hrobský (11-04-2003). [https://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/homo-homini-awards-recognize-the-work-of-three-vietnamese-activists Homo Homini Awards recognize the work of three Vietnamese activists], Czech Radio&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Thích Quảng Độ was awarded the [[Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize]], in recognition of "personal courage and perseverance through three decades of peaceful opposition against the communist regime in Vietnam, and as a symbol for the growing democracy movement". Thích Quảng Độ was unable to the receive the award, as the government prevented him from attending the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;The Rafto Foundation, [https://www.rafto.no/the-rafto-prize/thich-quang-do 2006 Laureate Thích Quảng Độ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Thích Quảng Độ was also awarded the Democracy Courage Tribute by the World Movement for Democracy.

In January 2008, the Europe-based magazine ''[[A Different View]]'' chose Độ as one of the 15 Champions of World Democracy. Others in the list include [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Lech Wałęsa]], [[Corazon Aquino]], and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

{{Rights}}
'''Unenumerated rights''' are legal rights inferred from other legal rights that are officiated in a retrievable form codified by law institutions, such as in written constitutions, but are not themselves expressly coded or "enumerated" among the explicit writ of the law. Alternative terminology sometimes used are: '''implied rights''', '''natural rights''', '''background rights''', and '''fundamental rights'''.&lt;ref name=USHouseJudiciary&gt;[http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/2186.htm "Committee on the Judiciary Tushnet Statement re Hearing on 'the Origin and Scope of Roe v. Wade'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808233931/http://judiciary.house.gov/legacy/2186.htm# |date=2007-08-08 }}. [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]], [[United States House of Representatives]] ([[Washington, D.C.]]. April 22, 1996. {{deadlink|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unenumerated rights will be actual rights insofar as they necessitate the systematization of positively enumerated rights anywhere laws would become logically incoherent, or could not be adhered to or maintained in the exclusion of those unenumerated items as rights. Examples of this include federal systems where constituent member constitutions have to be interpreted in relation to their membership in the federal whole, adjudicative of whether authority is rightfully [[Devolution|devolved]] or more rightly federative.&lt;ref name=USHouseJudiciary/&gt;

This term alternatively, is used loosely to mean any perceived rights, often considered peremptory or intuitively fiat (such as rights innate to each individual or inherent to mankind), that are without expression or instance of articulation.&lt;ref name=USHouseJudiciary/&gt;

==In Australia==
{{main|Implied rights in Australian constitutional law}}
Implied rights are the political and civil freedoms that necessarily underlie the actual words of the constitution but are not themselves expressly stated directly in the constitution. Since the 1990s the High Court has discovered rights which are said to be implied by the very structure and textual form of the Constitution. Chief amongst these is an implied right to freedom of communication on political matters, which was first recognised in ''[[Nationwide News Pty Ltd v Wills]]''. In addition, some protections of civil liberties have been the result of the High Court's zealous attempts to safeguard the independence of, and confidence in, the Federal judiciary.  A good example of this can be seen in ''[[Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW)]]'', in which the High Court struck down a criminal law passed by the New South Wales Parliament that was directed at a single named individual in a similar manner to a [[Bill of attainder]]. The High Court also inferred a limited right to vote from the text of the Constitution in ''[[Roach v Electoral Commissioner]]'',  invalidating legislation that prevented all prisoners from voting.

==In Ireland==

Article 40.3 of the [[Constitution of Ireland|Irish constitution]] refers to and accounts for the recognition of unenumerated rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theundisciplined.com/2014/05/13/something-from-nothing-the-irish-unenumerated-rights-doctrine/ TheUndisciplined.com – ''Something from Nothing: The Irish Unenumerated Rights Doctrine'']&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]] is often the main source of such rights, such as the right to bodily integrity, the right to marry and the right to earn a living, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.ie/SupremeCourt/sclibrary3.nsf/pagecurrent/D5F78352A387D74480257315005A419E?opendocument&amp;l=en Supreme Court of Ireland – '''The Legal System''' (''Fundamental Rights'')]&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Republic of China==
Article 22 of the [[Constitution of the Republic of China]] guarantees unenumerated freedoms and rights of the people that are not detrimental to social order or public welfare, now in effect in [[Taiwan]].

==In the United States==
In the United States, the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] protects against federal infringement of unenumerated rights. The text reads:&lt;blockquote&gt;The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has also interpreted the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] to protect against state infringement of certain unenumerated rights including, among others, the [[Pierce v. Society of Sisters|right to send one's children to private school]] and the [[Griswold v. Connecticut|right to marital privacy]].

The Supreme Court has found that unenumerated rights include such important rights as the right to travel, the right to vote, the right to keep personal matters private and to make important decisions about one’s health care or body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/ninth-amendment-non-enumerated-rights-retained-by-people|title=Ninth Amendment: Non-Enumerated Rights Retained by People - National Constitution Center|website=National Constitution Center – constitutioncenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Observation ==
[[Valentine's Day#Japan|Valentine's Day]] in countries which observe White Day is typically observed by girls and women presenting chocolate gifts (either store-bought or handmade), usually to boys or men, as an expression of love, courtesy, or social obligation.

On White Day, the reverse happens: men who received a {{nihongo3 |'chocolate of love'|本命チョコ|[[Honmei choco|honmei-choco]]}} or {{nihongo3 |'courtesy chocolate'|義理チョコ|[[Giri choco|giri-choco]]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.japantravelinfo.com/blog/valentines-day-white-day-in-japan/ | title=Valentine’s Day &amp; White Day in Japan | publisher=[[Japan National Tourism Organization]] | accessdate=13 March 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504234139/http://www.japantravelinfo.com/blog/valentines-day-white-day-in-japan/ | archive-date=2014-05-04 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on Valentine's Day are expected to return the favor by giving gifts.&lt;ref name="uh"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.crosscurrents.hawaii.edu/content.aspx?lang=eng&amp;site=japan&amp;theme=cal&amp;subtheme=CULTURHOL&amp;unit=JCAL018 | title=White Day (March 14) | work=Cross Currents | publisher=[[University of Hawaii]] | accessdate=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, popular White Day gifts are [[cookies]], [[jewelry]], [[white chocolate]], white [[lingerie]], and [[marshmallows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Culture | publisher = Japan 101 | url = http://www.japan-101.com/culture/valentines_day.htm | contribution = Valentine’s day}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the term {{nihongo3 |'triple the return'|三倍返し|sanbai gaeshi}} is used to describe the generally recited rule for men that the return gift should be two to three times the worth of the Valentine's gift.&lt;ref name = "Iroha"&gt;{{Citation | script-title=ja:ホワイトデー | url = http://iroha-japan.net/iroha/A01_event/06_wd.html |trans-title=White Day | publisher = Japanese Culture Iroha Dictionary | language = Japanese}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
White Day was first celebrated in 1978 in Japan.&lt;ref name = "Iroha" /&gt; It was started by the National Confectionery Industry Association as an "answer day" to Valentine's Day on the grounds that men should pay back the women who gave them chocolate and other gifts on Valentine's Day. In 1977, a [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]]-based confectionery company, Ishimuramanseido, marketed [[marshmallow]]s to men on March 14, calling it {{nihongo |Marshmallow Day|マシュマロデー|Mashumaro Dē}}.&lt;ref name="Iroha" /&gt;

Soon thereafter, confectionery companies began marketing [[white chocolate]]. Now, men give both white and [[dark chocolate]], as well as other edible and non-edible gifts, such as [[jewelry]] or objects of sentimental value, or white clothing like [[lingerie]], to women from whom they received chocolate on Valentine's Day one month earlier.&lt;ref name="uh"/&gt; Flowers and other gifts are also given on this day. Eventually, this practice spread to the neighboring East Asian countries of South Korea, China, Taiwan and Vietnam. In those cultures, White Day is for the most part observed in a similar manner.

As a note in Japan, if chocolate given to a man a month prior was ''giri choco'', the man may not be expressing actual romantic interest, but rather a [[Giri (Japanese)|social obligation]].
