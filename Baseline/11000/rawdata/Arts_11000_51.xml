'''Abraham Joseph Berline''' (6 October 1893 &amp;ndash; 1942) was a [[Russia]]n artist who lived in [[Paris]] and died during [[World War II]].

Abraham Joseph Berline was born on October 6, 1893, in [[Nizhyn]], [[Russian Empire]] (currently in [[Ukraine]]). He was the son of Leib Berline and Hana Kaganoff. In 1912, at the age of 19, he emigrated to Paris to study at the [[Ecole des Beaux Arts]]. He supported himself by driving a taxi and every place he saw figured in his landscapes. His work was highly regarded and exhibited at the most prestigious Parisian salons: [[Salon d'Automne]], [[Salon des Indépendants]], [[Salon des Tuileries]], the [[Paul Appel Gallery]], and in private galleries.

When [[France]] was invaded, Berline joined the [[Resistance during World War II|Resistance]], but in May 1941 Berline was arrested in the Billet Vert operation and interned as a Russian Jew in [[Compiègne]] camp. He continued to produce work, mainly pastels, focusing on the beauty of nature, in an attempt to transcend the camp experience through art. These paintings were shown in the camp along with other artists' work. After seven months he was transferred to [[Drancy internment camp]], and from there to [[Auschwitz]], as was his wife Doucia—never to return. His works are included in the art collection of the  [[Ghetto Fighters' House|Ghetto Fighters' House Museum]] and the [[Musée d'Histoire Contemporaine]] in Paris.

== Legislative Policy ==
[[ASID]] revised their legislative policy in January 2009.  The policy was revised to best serve the societies membership and goals. The legislative policy of the organization is as follows:

:1. ASID supports the pursuit of legal recognition of the profession of interior design. In doing so, ASID believes accomplishing legal recognition is best achieved through the enactment of legislation that:
::a. Does not limit, restrict or prevent the practice of interior design;
::b. Does not limit, restrict or prevent anyone from using the title “interior design” or “interior designer;”
::c. Allows state-qualified interior designers to (a) use the title “registered,” “certified” or “licensed” interior designer and (b) perform such additional services related to the practice of interior design as applicable governing jurisdictions deem appropriate for statequalified interior designers to perform. (amended 1/09)
:2. ASID supports the National Council for Interior Design Qualifications (NCIDQ) as the body whose professional exam tests minimum competency for state qualified interior designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.asid.org/NR/rdonlyres/81D9C044-3010-4FE2-9519-4E9A438A272F0/LegPositiononletterhead.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725021115/http://www.asid.org/NR/rdonlyres/81D9C044-3010-4FE2-9519-4E9A438A272F0/LegPositiononletterhead.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5085">[[Image:Chinese New Year's poetry.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Hand-written [[Chinese New Year]]'s duilian]]

In [[Chinese poetry]], a '''couplet''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|对|联}}|t={{linktext|對|聯}}|p={{Audio|Zh-duìlián.ogg|duìlián|help=no}}}}) is a pair of lines of poetry which adhere to certain rules (see below). Outside of poems, they are usually seen on the sides of doors leading to people's homes or as [[hanging scroll]]s in an interior. Although often called '''antithetical couplet''', they can better be described as a written form of [[counterpoint]]. The two lines have a one-to-one correspondence in their [[metre (poetry)|metrical length]], and each pair of [[Chinese character|characters]] must have certain corresponding properties. A couplet is ideally profound yet concise, using one character per word in the style of [[Classical Chinese]]. A special, widely seen type of couplet is the [[spring couplet]] ({{zh|t={{linktext|春|聯}}|s={{linktext|春|联}}|p=chūnlián}}), used as a [[Chinese New Year|New Year's]] decoration that expresses happiness and hopeful thoughts for the coming year.

== Requirements ==
A couplet must adhere to the following rules:
#Both lines must have the same number of Chinese characters.
#The [[lexical category]] of each character must be the same as its corresponding character.
#The [[tone pattern]] of one line must be the inverse of the other.  This generally means if one character is of the level ({{linktext|平}}) tone, its corresponding character in the other line must be of an oblique ({{linktext|仄}}) tone.
#The last character of the first line should be of an oblique tone, which forces the last character of the second line to be of a level tone.
#The meanings of the two lines must be related, with each pair of corresponding characters having related meanings too.

=== Example ===
Example of a couplet:

:{{lang|zh-Hant|書山有路勤爲徑}}
::[[Tone pattern]]: {{lang|zh|平平仄仄平平仄}}
::[[Pinyin]]: ''shū shān yǒu lù qín wéi &lt;!--It cannot be wèi because 作 is 入聲, which is 仄.--&gt; jìng''
::Translation: The mountain of books has one way and hard work serves as the path
:{{lang|zh-Hant|學海無涯苦作舟}}
::Tone pattern: {{lang|zh|仄仄平平仄仄平}}
::Pinyin: ''xué hǎi wú yá kǔ zuò zhōu''
::Translation: The sea of learning has no end and effort makes the boat

== History and usage==
Originating during the [[Five Dynasties]], and flourishing during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing dynasties]] in particular, couplets have a history of more than a thousand years and remain an enduring aspect of Chinese culture.

Often, couplets are written on red paper and stuck on walls. Sometimes, they are carved onto plaques of wood for a more permanent display. 

Dueling couplets are a popular pastime with Chinese speakers,&lt;ref&gt;http://chinese.couplets.googlepages.com/&lt;/ref&gt; a game of verbal and intellectual dexterity, wit and speed which shares some parallels with [[the dozens]].  A notable modern-day example occurs at the 7:24 point of the second segment of the satirical [[machinima]] [[War of Internet Addiction]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUm8Jv_nUzs&lt;/ref&gt; (at 16:58 of the video's complete running time).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10016">[[File:Arca santa de Oviedo.JPG|thumb|300px|Arca Santa, the front panel]]
The '''Arca Santa''' ("Holy Ark", or chest) is an oak [[reliquary]] covered with silver-gilt decorated in the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque style]]. It is kept in the [[Cámara Santa]] of the [[Cathedral of San Salvador, Oviedo|Cathedral of San Salvador]] in [[Oviedo]]. In 1934 the Cámara Santa suffered an explosion that severely damaged the Arca, which was carefully restored by Manuel Gómez-Moreno.

==Description==
The Arca is a black oak box 72 by 119 by 93&amp;nbsp;cm, which is unusually large for a reliquary, more typical of the size of a small portable altar. It was constructed without nails, perhaps in imitation of [[Solomon's Temple]]. The whole is covered in silver: front and both sides are [[repoussé]], the back has a simple checkered pattern, and the flat lid is [[engrave]]d with [[niello]]. Appropriately for its size, the front panel is modelled after an altar front, depicting [[Christ in majesty]] on a [[mandorla]] carried by four angels and flanked by the [[Twelve Apostles]]. The panel is bordered on all sides by a [[Kufesque]] inscription.

The left side is a narrative cycle of [[Christ's infancy]] in five scenes arranged in two registers, read counterclockwise from the top right. The two rows are separated by a band which reads: &lt;small&gt;MARIA ET IOSEP POSUERUNT DOMINUM IN PRESEPIO ANIMALIU / ANGELUS APARUIT IOSEP DICENS FUGE IN EGIPTUM ET ESTO [IBI]&lt;/small&gt; ("Mary and Joseph put the Lord in the animals' manger / An angel appeared to Joseph saying, 'Flee into Egypt, and stay [there]"). The right side is also divided into two registers separated by a band of text. The top depicts Christ in a mandorla supported by two angels on the left and on the right [[Michael the Archangel]], flanked by a [[cherub]] and a [[seraph]], battling a dragon. The bottom row shows eight apostles in various poses, all apparently speaking. The band reads: &lt;small&gt;ASCENDENS XPS IN ALTUM CAPTIVAM DUXIT CAPTIVITATE / MICAEL ARCANGELUS PUGNAVIT CUM DRACONE&lt;/small&gt; ("Ascending on high, Christ led the captive from captivity / Michael the Archangel fought with the dragon").

The lid bears a detailed portrayal of [[Christ's crucifixion]], including the two thieves, the Virgin Mary, the "disciple whom Jesus loved" (John), angels with [[censer]]s, and personifications of the sun and moon. Surrounding the scene there is a long inscription.

==Contents==
Unusually for reliquaries of the Early Middle Ages, the Arca contained the relics of several saints. The most precious were a piece of the [[True Cross]], pieces from the [[Crown of Thorns]] and the [[Holy Sepulchre]], some bread from the [[Last Supper]], and some of the Virgin's milk. There was also a crystalline [[ampulla]] containing some blood from the [[Berytus icon]], an image of Christ first reported at the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787 to have emitted blood after it had been pierced by some Jews. The reported contents of the Arca Santa "reflect interest in the humanity of Christ, the Holy Family, and the Holy Land itself".&lt;ref&gt;Harris, 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides relics of the Holy Family, the [[Old Testament]] was represented in the Arca by the rod of [[Moses]] and some [[manna]]. Many relics of the apostles were contained in it, as well as the cloak which the Virgin reportedly gave to [[Ildephonsus of Toledo]].

The earliest recorded description of the Arca's contents is a notice added to an eleventh-century codex of [[Valenciennes]]&lt;ref&gt;Valenciennes, Bibliothèque municipale, MS 99.&lt;/ref&gt; This notice may have been based on a guide prepared by some clerks of the church of Oviedo. The lid of the Arca also contains a partial list of contents in silver repoussé. Another contemporary source for the contents of the Arca is a letter of [[Osmond (Bishop of Astorga)|Osmond]], [[Bishop of Astorga]], addressed to [[Ida of Lorraine|Ida of Boulogne]], about the Marian relics one could see in Spain.

===Sudarium of Oviedo===
{{further|Sudarium of Oviedo}}
The [[Sudarium of Oviedo]], or '''Shroud of Oviedo''', also '''cloth of Oviedo''', is the most notable relic of Christ's passion kept in the Arca Santa reliquary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=Janice |title=Sacred Blood, Sacred Image: The Sudarium of Oviedo, New Evidence for the Authenticity of the Shroud of Turin |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fKk2cU_-Q8UC |accessdate=21 October 2010 |date=January 2005 |publisher=Ignatius Press |isbn=978-0-9705682-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bloodstained cloth or ''sudarium'' (Latin for sweat cloth) is reputed to be the cloth wrapped around the head of Jesus Christ after he died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudariumchristi.com/uk/tomb/compare.htm Byssus and pure linen – Comparing the cloths] Multimedia comparison of the cloth of Oviedo and the sudarium of Manoppello, Texts: Blandina Paschalis Schlömer&lt;/ref&gt; There are notable congruencies with a number of related [[acheiropoieta]] images such as those of the [[Shroud of Turin|Turin]] and [[Manoppello Image|Manoppello]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epACTwQuxgE&amp;list=SPF32FC9003C098D97 The Rediscovered Face - 1] first of four installments of an audiovisual presentation relating the holy image with a number of ancient predecessors, YouTube, access date March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sudarium of Oviedo]] is displayed to the public three times a year: [[Good Friday]], the [[Exaltation of the Holy Cross|Feast of the Triumph of the Cross]] on 14 September, and its octave on 21 September.

==Origins==

===Legend===
Legends concerning the origins of the Arca Santa spread widely in the Middle Ages, and can be found in no less than ten sources between the eleventh and fourteenth centuries. In the ''[[Liber testamentorum]]'', composed around 1120 to record all the gifts and privileges received by the diocese of Oviedo, some disciples of the twelve apostles are given credit for constructing the Arca in [[Jerusalem]], where it is said to have remained until [[Chosroes II]] conquered the city in 614. At that time it was moved to Africa. The [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa|Islamic invasion]] forced its removal to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], at that time the capital of the [[Visigoths]]. When the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Muslims invaded Spain]]—as a result of the Visigothic kings' sins, according to the ''Liber''—in 711 the Arca was brought to Oviedo for safekeeping. Finally, in the early ninth century [[Alfonso II of Asturias]] constructed a chapel dedicated to Saint Michael (the Cámara Santa) to house it. In this chapel, now an annex of the cathedral of Oviedo, it remains to this day. A similar account of the translation is included in the ''[[Liber chronicorum]]'', a historical companion piece to the ''Liber testamentorum''. This in turn influenced accounts in the ''[[Historia silense]]'', the ''[[Chronicon mundi]]'', and ''[[De rebus Hispaniae]]''. Two biographies of [[Toribius of Astorga]], the ''Estoria de sancto Toribio'' and the ''Vida de santo Toribio de Liébana'', though they differ on many points, agree that Toribius took refuge in Spain with some relics from Jerusalem, where he had been guarding them, safely hidden in a wooden ark.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Fernández González, [http://revistas.ucm.es/fll/02122952/articulos/DICE9999110029A.PDF "Vidas y dichos de Santo Toribio de Liébana conservados en el monasterio que lleva su nombre"], ''Dicenda: Cuadernos de Filología Hispánica'', '''17''' (1999), 29–40.&lt;/ref&gt; While the ''Estoria'' presents a long list of items stored away in the Arca, the ''Vida'' mentions only a piece of wood from the True Cross and a jar which held the [[Wedding at Cana|wine of Jesus' first miracle at Cana]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''E en cabo de los tres años aparescióle otra vez el ángel de Dios e díxole:&lt;br&gt;
''— Turibio, lleva las reliquias a las partidas de España ca sepas que toda esta tierra a de seer destruyda de moros.&lt;br&gt;
''E santo Turibio fizo luego assí e puso las reliquias en la barca, entre las quales traxo primeramente un pedaço de la cruz donde fue crucificado el nuestro salvador Jhesu Christo, e una tinaja de las en que consagró del agua vino e de otras muchas reliquias de santos e santas.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And at the end of the three years the angel of God appeared to him again and said to him: "Turibius, carry the relics to the parts of Spain because you know that all this land must be destroyed by the Moors." And Saint Turibius then did thus and put the relics&lt;ref&gt;The relics were already in an ''arca'' by then.&lt;/ref&gt; on the ship, among which were firstly a piece of the cross where our saviour Jesus Christ was crucified, and one of the jars in which he consecrated the water wine, and many other relics of saints men and women.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===History===
Traditionally, historians have credited the adornment of the Arca and the Cámara to [[Alfonso VI of León]] and his sister [[Urraca of Zamora]] and dated it to 1075. On 13 March that year, according to Document 72 of the cathedral archives of Oviedo, Alfonso and Urraca had the reliquary opened in their presence and examined the contents. This document, dated 14 March, survives only in a thirteenth-century copy, and its authenticity has been questioned. It may have been produced to bolster the claims of Oviedo and its shrine against those of Santiago.

Early influences on her work include her interdisciplinary Classical studies at NYU, engagement in activism, as with the [[Bread and Puppet Theatre]], her work in city planning in [[San Diego County]] in the 1980s and [[Vinalhaven Island]], Maine in the 1990s, and the merging of science with aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kagan|first=Sacha|title=Art and Sustainability: Connecting Patterns for a Culture of Complexity|year=2011|publisher=Transcript Verlag|location=Bielefeld, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boettger|first=Suzaan|title=Global Warnings|journal=Art in America|year=2008|volume=June/July 2008|pages=161, 206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Rahmani attended the [[Cooper Union]] School of Art and Architecture, and got her MA from the [[California Institute of the Arts]], [[Valencia, California]] on a scholarship and stipend to work with [[Allan Kaprow]] and Morton Sobotnick, receiving a double degree in multi-media and electronic music. Rahmani has taught, lectured and performed internationally, and is the recipient of numerous grants and fellowships including two from the Nancy H. Gray Foundation for Art in the Environment in 1999 and 2000. More recently, Rahmani concurrently studied for a GIS certificate at [[Lehman College]], CUNY, while finishing a dissertation at [[Plymouth University]], UK.

==Biography==
Rahmani's background in performance and conceptual art begin with her founding and directing the performance group the American Ritual Theatre (1968- 1971).&lt;ref&gt;(Love, Jones, Welton 1969, Blaze)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, she collaborated with [[Judy Chicago]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], and Sandi Orgel on ''Ablutions'', now considered a groundbreaking feminist performance work on rape (Chicago, Judy Through the Flower).

In 1999, Rahmani was a founding member of the ''Eco-art Dialog'', an international collective of ecological art practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;http://weadartists.org/changing-aesthetics-creating-teams-3 Israel Forum for Ecological Art&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahmani has received numerous grants and fellowships including two from the Nancy H. Gray Foundation for Art in the Environment and a 2009 award for her work on water from the Arts and Healing Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lippard|first=Lucy|title=Undermining|year=2014|publisher=New Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Rahmani has performed and exhibited work at numerous venues, including the [[Hudson River Museum]], [[Exit Art]], and the Cincinnati [[Contemporary Arts Center]] ([[Ecovention]], exhibition) in Ohio.

One of Rahmani's best known works is ''Ghost Nets'' 1990-2000 (Tallmer, Kagan, Carruthers, Genocchio), which includes her original theories of environmental restoration and trigger point theory. In 2012, she applied trigger point theory and the "Gulf to Gulf" webcasts to "Fish Story Memphis," a multi-part public art project designed for “Memphis Social,” curated by Tom McGlynn (2013) (Memphis is the Center of the World).

In 2006, Rahmani initiated a series of podcasts, "Virtual Cities and Oceans of If", which segued into webcasts on climate change. She is currently an Affiliate with the [[Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research]] at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], [[Colorado]] (UCB), where she has been collaborating with the Director, James White since 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Denson|first=Roger|title=Nomad|newspaper=Huffington Post|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  on, "Gulf to Gulf," a series of webcasts on global warming with other scientists, artists and thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;(Boettger,NY Times, Lippard, Weather Report)&lt;/ref&gt; Their first collaborative work premiered with Cultura21 in the [[Joseph Beuys]] Pavilion of the 2007 [[Venice Biennale]].

In 2007, Rahmani in collaboration with White appeared in the collective exhibition Weather Report, debuting her titled work “Trigger Points, Tipping Points.” Rahmani displayed a series of digital prints that superimposed satellite imagery with textual warnings on the morphing and changing of climate change on the global landscape. Her work embodies a discourse that focuses on the power dynamics of disaster and how rising sea levels will not only effect  landscape, but also result in the relocation of communities and refugee migration. Rahmani seamlessly ties together climate change with the themes of class, power, and justice — a conversation not as prevalent in the global warming conversation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunaway|first=Finis|date=2009|title=Seeing Global Warming: Contemporary Art and the Fate of the Planet|jstor=25473326|journal=Environmental History|volume=14|issue=1|pages=9–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Rahmani served as a formal observer for [[University of Colorado Boulder]] at the COP15 and blogged about her experience for High Tide, an arts collective based in Liverpool, UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainablepractice.org/2009/12/18/high-tide-art-and-aviva-at-poulsen-cop15/ Center for Sustainable Practice in the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahmani's current work reflects her interest in the application of mapping analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rahmani|first=Aviva|title=Mapping Trigger Point Theory as Aesthetic Activism|journal=Parsons Journal for Information Mapping|date=2012|volume=IV|issue=1|url=http://piim.newschool.edu/journal/issues/2012/01/index.php|accessdate=19 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to "explore potential solutions for urban and rural water degradation in large landscapes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Genocchio|first=Benjamin|title=Digging In to Nurture Nature|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahmani's recent work also uses the internet "to perform residencies without the international travel that spews jet fuel over the earth's waters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boetzkes|first=Amanda|title=At the Limit of Form: The Ethics of Contemporary Earth Art|year=2010|publisher=University of Minnesota Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Virtual Cities and Oceans of If and the ongoing Virtual Concerts address global warming and geo-political conflicts by demonstrating, analyzing and interpreting the local impact of global warming at international real world sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lippard|first=Lucy|title=Weather Report|year=2007|publisher=Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art|location=Boulder, Colorado}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beehive Design Collective''' is a [[Volunteering|volunteer]]-driven [[non-profit]] [[arts organization]] that uses graphical media as educational tools to communicate stories of [[Resistance movement|resistance]] to [[corporate globalization]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2011|title="Drawing Common Ground: An Interview with Lara Bee of the Beehive Design Collective:|url=|journal=Upping the Anti: a journal of theory and action|volume=12|pages=55-71|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the group, based in [[Machias, Maine]], is to "Cross-pollinate the [[grassroots]]" by creating collaborative, [[anti-copyright]] images that can be used as educational and organizing tools.  The most recognizable of these images are large format pen and ink posters, which seek to provide a visual alternative to [[deconstruction]] of complicated social and political issues ranging from [[globalization]], [[free trade]], [[militarism]], [[resource extraction]], and [[biotechnology]].

==Graphic campaigns==

The Collective creates graphic campaigns addressing diverse geo- and socio-political issues.  The illustrations are informed and developed through extensive research. The most recent campaign resulted from travel to [[Mexico]] and interviews of a broad spectrum of people. The group adheres to self-imposed rules during their campaign production, including absence of literal human depictions, use of cross-cultural imagery, and avoidance of cultural appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beehivecollective.org/english/graphics_campaigns.htm About Beehive Graphic Campaigns]&lt;/ref&gt;

The current trilogy in progress details globalization in the western hemisphere through a series of three graphics.
 
==Storytelling==
The Collective's educational work involves storytelling, international lecture circuits using giant reproductions of their posters as storytelling aids. "Picture lectures" feature a 30-feet high graphic and a {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}} fabric flipbook/storybook. Audiences are led through a two-hour interactive, conversational presentation. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beehivecollective.org/english/tour.htm Beehive Collective presentation info and presentation schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Print distribution==
One of the Beehive's goals in their graphic distribution is to have 50% of each print run distributed to communities in the global south free of charge.  The remaining half are distributed internationally for donations.  Posters are distributed at a wide range of venues, events, college campuses and academic events.

All of the Beehive Collective's materials are distributed as [[anti-copyright]], and their production is encouraged for non-profit, non-commercial use to assist in publications and productions.  The black and white imagery is designed to facilitate ease of reproduction.  The Beehive distributes free clip-art digital imagery via their website and graphic CD-ROMs distributed from their webstore.

==Machias Valley Grange Hall==
[[Image:Grange-roofing.jpg|thumb|150px|Installing a new roof on the Machias Valley Grange Hall.]]
Since the year 2000, the Collective has been engaged in the restoration of the Machias Valley [[The National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry|Grange]] Hall, located in [[Machias, Maine]].,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beehivecollective.org/english/thegrange.htm About the Grange Hall]&lt;/ref&gt; built in 1904. The restoration labor was sourced from visiting volunteers. The building was initially used as the Collective's center of its stone mosaics program.

Annually, the Collective throws a no-cost dress-up dance party of immense proportions called the "Blackfly Ball".&lt;ref&gt;They had a Ball - Ellsworth American news report on the Machias Blackfly Ball [https://archive.is/20070619044406/http://ellsworthmaine.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=9779&amp;Itemid=185]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.beehivecollective.org/images/blackflyball-article2.jpg |title=Downeast Coastal Press Eyewitness Account of Blackfly Ball |access-date=2007-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921175329/http://www.beehivecollective.org/images/blackflyball-article2.jpg |archive-date=2007-09-21 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are ongoing events such as a weekly Open Mic night and annual Halloween celebration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4417">The '''Castle of Mós''' ({{lang-pt|Castelo de Porto de Mós}}) is a medieval [[castle]] located in the [[Freguesia (Portugal)|civil parish]] of Mós, [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Torre de Moncorvo]], in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] district of [[Bragança District|Bragança]].  

It is classified by [[IGESPAR]] as a Site of Public Interest.

Just north of the village, the castle was erected on a vegetation-heavy small hill called the Promenade de Mos, an ancient road axis in the region. There is also another Mos Castle in Mos, Vigo, Galicia.

==History==

===Ancient Times===
Some evidence indicate that early human occupation of the region come from the Early [[Iron Age]].

===The medieval castle===
Although there is little to no information on the founding or early history, the village secured a royal charter from [[Afonso I of Portugal|Afonso I o Portugal]] (1112-1185) in 1162.

Under the reign of [[Sancho II of Portugal]] (1248-1279), inquiries in 1258 reported that the county held a third of the tithes from the Church of Santa Maria de Mos for the repair and maintenance of the town's castle. The source of the funds was explained in a letter [[Afonso IV of Portugal|Alfonso IV of Portugal]] (1325-1357) states that the sovereign granted the "people of the Church are giving money".

Near the end of the Middle Ages, fighting had depopulated the village and swung favor to the nearby village of Carviçais. During the reign of [[Ferdinand I of Portugal|Fernando]], he ended the power of the village and transferred it to Moncorvo Tower.

In the late seventeenth century, Father Carvalho da Costa recorded a similar position, stating that this villa one sees almost hum aruinado Castello delle with his cistern inside, which turns out to be the old village villa of more account. At this stage, the castle had only 90 fires, while in Carviçais neighbor, the only place term 250 were counted.

===Nineteeth Century to the Modern Day===
In the nineteenth century, the Municipality of Mos was abolished and integrated in the municipality of Torre de Moncorvo.
The castle remains are classified as Public Interest Property by decree published on 20 October 1955. In the 1960s part of the medieval wall collapsed, registering a particular construction on a walled section. At the time, it was felt the intervention of the government by the action of DGEMN, through the reconstruction of a section of the wall and work in the surrounding area (1963).
Currently there remain only traces of some sections of wall with addorsed dwelling houses. Outside the walls stand out the Church of Santa Maria and the pillory.

==Characteristics==
The small castle has site design with oval format in the Romanesque style. The wall in shale rock girl is torn south through the door, communicating with the outskirts of the medieval village and the paths towards Freixo de Espada a Cinta, Alva, Moncorvo and Miranda Tower. Internally, the village is structured around the Straight Street, which defined a north-south axis. Extra walls were erected the Church of Santa Maria and on the opposite side, opposite to the castle gate, the square with the Town Hall and the pillory.
The type of Mos village organization reveals a similar pattern to the Freixo de Espada a Cinta, and the [[Castle of Alva]]. Respect to [[Castle of Freixo de Espada a Cinta]], roars and [[Alva River (Mondego)|Alva]], with which it has affinities, the Mos is the only one with the Church of Santa Maria located on the opposite side off developed opposite the main gate of the fence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Monumentos|url = http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=474|access-date = 2016-02-13|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304141835/http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=474|archivedate = 2016-03-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Monumentos|url = http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=474|access-date = 2016-02-13|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304141835/http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=474|archivedate = 2016-03-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christian symbolism''' is the use of [[symbol]]s, including [[archetypes]], acts, artwork or events, by [[Christianity]]. It invests objects or actions with an inner meaning expressing Christian ideas.

The symbolism of the [[early Church]] was characterized by being understood by initiates only,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Christian Symbolism | last=Jenner |first=Henry|authorlink=Henry Jenner |publisher=Kessinger Publishing|year=2004|origyear=1910|page=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; while after the legalization of Christianity in the 4th-century more recognizable symbols entered in use. [[Christianity]] has borrowed from the common stock of significant symbols known to most periods and to all regions of the world.&lt;ref name="ces"&gt;{{CathEncy |wstitle=Symbolism| author=Herbert Thurston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christianity]] has not generally practiced [[Aniconism in Christianity|Aniconism]], or the avoidance or prohibition of types of images, even if the early [[Jewish Christian]]s sects, as well as some modern [[Christian denomination|denomination]]s, preferred to some extent not to use figures in their symbols, by invoking the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue's]] prohibition of [[idolatry]].

--&gt;
The shape of the cross, as represented by the letter [[Tau (letter)|T]], came to be used as a "seal" or symbol of [[Early Christianity]] by the 2nd century.&lt;ref&gt;"The cross as a Christian symbol or 'seal' came into use at least as early as the second century (see "Apost. Const." iii. 17; Epistle of Barnabas, xi.-xii.; Justin, "Apologia," i. 55-60; "Dial. cum Tryph." 85-97); and the marking of a cross upon the forehead and the chest was regarded as a talisman against the powers of demons (Tertullian, "De Corona," iii.; Cyprian, "Testimonies," xi. 21-22; Lactantius, "Divinæ Institutiones," iv. 27, and elsewhere).  The Christian Fathers had to defend themselves, as early as the second century, against the charge of being worshipers of the cross, as may be learned from Tertullian, "Apologia," xii., xvii., and Minucius Felix, "Octavius," xxix. Christians used to swear by the power of the cross. [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=899&amp;letter=C  CROSS:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;],  [[Jewish Encyclopaedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of the 2nd century, it is mentioned in  the ''[[Octavius (dialogue)|Octavius]]'' of [[Minucius Felix]], rejecting the claim by detractors that Christians worship the cross.&lt;ref&gt;"Crosses, moreover, we neither worship nor wish for.1815  You, indeed, who consecrate gods of wood, adore wooden crosses perhaps as parts of your gods.  For your very standards, as well as your banners; and flags of your camp, what else are they but crosses glided and adorned?  Your victorious trophies not only imitate the appearance of a simple cross, but also that of a man affixed to it.  We assuredly see the sign of a cross,1816 naturally, in the ship when it is carried along with swelling sails, when it glides forward with expanded oars; and when the military yoke is lifted up, it is the sign of a cross; and when a man adores God with a pure mind, with hands outstretched.  Thus the sign of the cross either is sustained by a natural reason, or your own religion is formed with respect to it."
''Cruces etiam nec colimus, nec optamus. Vos plane qui ligneos deos consecratis, cruces ligneas, ut deorum vestrorum partes, forsitan adoratis. (0332B) Nam et signa ipsa et cantabra et vexilla castrorum, quid aliud quam inauratae cruces sunt et ornatae? Tropaea vestra victricia, non tantum simplicis crucis faciem, verum et affixi hominis imitantur. Signum sane crucis naturaliter visimus in navi, quum velis tumentibus vehitur, quum expansis palmulis labitur; et quum erigitur iugum, crucis signum est, et quum homo, porrectis manibus, Deum pura mente veneratur. Ita signo crucis aut ratio naturalis innititur, aut vestra religio formatur.'' ([http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/ANF-04/anf04-34.htm#P5713_906729 Octavius of Minucius Felix], chapter 29)
&lt;/ref&gt;
The cross (crucifix, Greek ''[[stauros]]'') in this period was represented by the letter [[T]]. [[Clement of Alexandria]] in the early 3rd century calls it {{lang|grc|τὸ κυριακὸν σημεῖον}} ("the Lord's sign")  he repeats the idea, current as early as the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], that the number 318 (in [[Greek numerals]], ΤΙΗ) in {{bibleverse||Genesis|14:14}} was a foreshadowing (a "type") of the cross (T, an upright with crossbar, standing for 300) and of Jesus (ΙΗ, the first two letters of his name ΙΗΣΟΥΣ, standing for 18).&lt;ref name="CA"&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/clement-stromata-book6.html Stromata, book VI, chapter XI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clement's contemporary [[Tertullian]] also rejects the accusation that Christians are  ''crucis religiosi'' (i.e. "adorers of the gibbet"), and returns the  accusation by likening the worship of pagan idols to the worship of poles or stakes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0301.htm ''Apology''., chapter xvi.]  Tertullian uses ''crux'' "cross", ''palus'' "pole" and ''stipes'' "stake" interchangeably for rhetoric effect:
"Then, if any of you think we render superstitious adoration to the cross, in that adoration he is sharer with us. If you offer homage to a piece of wood at all, it matters little what it is like when the substance is the same: it is of no consequence the form, if you have the very body of the god. And yet how far does the Athenian Pallas differ from the stock of the cross, or the Pharian Ceres as she is put up uncarved to sale, a mere rough stake and piece of shapeless wood? Every stake fixed in an upright position is a portion of the cross; we render our adoration, if you will have it so, to a god entire and complete. We have shown before that your deities are derived from shapes modelled from the cross."
''Sed et qui crucis nos religiosos putat, consecraneus noster erit. Cum lignum aliquod propitiatur, viderit habitus, dum materiae qualitas eadem sit; viderit forma, dum id ipsum dei corpus sit. Et tamen quanto distinguitur a crucis stipite Pallas Attica, et Ceres Pharia, quae sine effigie rudi palo et informi ligno prostat? Pars crucis est omne robur, quod erecta statione defigitur; nos, si forte, integrum et totum deum colimus. Diximus originem deorum vestrorum a plastis de cruce induci.''&lt;/ref&gt;
In his book ''De Corona'', written in 204, Tertullian tells how it was already a tradition for Christians to trace repeatedly on their foreheads the [[sign of the cross]].&lt;ref&gt;"At every forward step and movement, at every going in and out, when we put on our clothes and shoes, when we bathe, when we sit at table, when we light the lamps, on couch, on seat, in all the ordinary actions of daily life, we trace upon the forehead the sign" ([http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf03.iv.vi.iii.html ''De Corona'', chapter 3])&lt;/ref&gt;

While early Christians used the T-shape to represent the cross in writing and gesture, the use of the [[Greek cross]] and [[Latin cross]], i.e. crosses with intersecting beams, appears in [[Christian art]] towards the end of [[Late Antiquity]]. An early example of the [[cruciform halo]], used to identify Christ in paintings, is found in the ''Miracles of the Loaves and Fishes'' mosaic of [[Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]], Ravenna (dated c. 504).[[File:Celtic cross in Autumn.jpg|thumb|left|20th-21st century Celtic cross with inscribed symbolism]]

The [[Patriarchal cross]], a Latin cross with an additional horizontal bar, first appears in the 10th century.

The [[Celtic cross]], now often characterized by the presence of the outline of a circle upon which a cross, stylized in a pre-Medieval Celtic fashion, appears superimposed. The Celtic cross bears strong resemblance to the Christian cross; however, the Celtic cross motif predates Christianity by at least 3,000 years. It appears in the form of heavily sculpted, vertically oriented, ancient monoliths which survive in the present day, in various locations on the island of Ireland. A few of the ancient monuments were evidently relocated to stand in some of Ireland's earliest churchyards, probably between 400 CE and 600 CE, as Christianity was popularized throughout much of the island. The heavily-worn stone sculptures likely owe their continued survival to their sheer size and solid rock construction, which coordinate in scale, and in composition, with Ireland's ancient megalith arrangements. 

Unlike the Christian cross iconography associated with the shape of a crucifix (commonly used for torture and execution of criminals and captured enemy prisoners-of-war, by the pre-Christian Roman Empire), the Celtic cross' design origins are not clear. The Celtic cross has nevertheless been repeated in statuary, as a dominant feature of the anthropogenic Irish landscape, for at least 5,000 years. The Celtic cross and the Christian cross are similar enough in shape, that the former was easily adopted by Irish Catholic culture, following the Christianization of Ireland. The Celtic cross is accurately described as an ancient symbol of cultural significance in pre-Christian, Druidic Ireland. It also is used as a symbolic icon of the interpretation of Christianity, unique to Irish culture in that pre-Christian Celtic tradition and Irish Druidic iconography are hybridized with Christian traditions and iconography (much like the Shamrock; a low-growing, daintily foliaged, dense ground cover plant, which is held as a timeless symbol of Ireland itself; and, which is also symbolic on Ireland, of the Christian Holy Trinity, due to the Shamrock's typical trifoliar leaf structure).

Although the cross was used as a symbol by early Christians, the [[crucifix]], i.e.  [[Crucifixion in the arts|depictions of the crucifixion scene]], were rare prior to the 5th century; some  [[engraved gem]]s thought to be 2nd or 3rd century have survived, but the subject does not appear in the art of the [[Catacombs of Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, Gertrud, '' Iconography of Christian Art'', Vol. II, 1972, 89-90, fig. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;
The purported discovery of the [[True Cross]] by Constantine's mother, [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]], and the development of [[Calvary|Golgotha]] as a site for [[pilgrimage]] led to a change of attitude.  It was probably in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] that the image developed, and many of the earliest depictions are on the [[Monza ampullae]], small metal flasks for holy oil, that were pilgrim's souvenirs from the [[Holy Land]], as well as 5th century ivory reliefs from Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, Gertrud, '' Iconography of Christian Art'', Vol. II, 1972, 89-90, figs. 322-326.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early medieval period, the plain cross became depicted as the [[crux gemmata]], covered with jewels, as many real early medieval [[processional cross]]es in goldsmith work were.
The first depictions of crucifixion displaying suffering are believed to have arisen in [[Byzantine art]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9028045/crucifixion Encyclopædia Britannica Online]&lt;/ref&gt; where the "S"-shaped slumped body type was developed.  Early Western examples include the [[Gero Cross]] and the reverse of the [[Cross of Lothair]], both from the end of the 10th century.

[[File:Ephesus IchthysCrop.jpg|thumb|An Ichthys from ancient [[Ephesus]]]]
Among the symbols employed by the early Christians, that of the fish seems to have ranked first in importance. Its popularity among Christians was due principally to the famous [[acrostic]] consisting of the initial letters of five [[Koine Greek|Greek]] words forming the word for fish (Ichthus), which words briefly but clearly described the character of Christ and the claim to worship of believers: "{{lang|grc|'''Ἰ'''ησοῦς '''Χ'''ριστὸς '''Θ'''εοῦ '''Υ'''ἱὸς '''Σ'''ωτήρ}}", (Iēsous Christos Theou Huios Sōtēr), meaning, ''Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour''.&lt;ref name="cefish"&gt;{{CathEncy |wstitle=Symbolism of the Fish| author=Maurice Hassett }}&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation is given among others by [[Augustine]] in his [[City of God (book)|Civitate Dei]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=The City of God |wslink=The City of God/Book XVIII/Chapter 23 |author=Augustine |authorlink=Augustine |at=XVIII, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he also notes that the generating sentence {{lang|grc|"Ίησοῦς Χρειστὸς [[sic|[sic]]] Θεοῦ Υἱὸς Σωτήρ"}} has 27 letters, i.e. 3 x 3 x 3, which in that age indicated power.

[[File:Christ with beard.jpg|thumb|Jesus depicted with the alpha and omega letters in the catacombs of Rome from the 4th century]]
{{main|Alpha and Omega}}

The use since the earliest Christianity of the first and the last letters of the [[Greek alphabet]], [[alpha (letter)|alpha]] ('''α''' or '''Α''') and [[omega (letter)|omega]] ('''ω''' or '''Ω'''), derives from the statement said by Jesus (or God) himself "I am Alpha and Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End" ({{bibleverse||Revelation|22:13|KJV}}, also 1:8 and 21:6).

The Staurogram was first used to abbreviate the Greek word for cross in very early [[New Testament]] [[manuscript]]s such as [[Papyrus 66|P66]], [[Papyrus 45|P45]] and [[Papyrus 75|P75]], almost like a [[nomina sacra|nomen sacrum]], and may visually have represented Jesus on the cross.&lt;ref name="Hurtado"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Kraus | editor-first = Thomas | title = New Testament Manuscripts | publisher = Brill | location = Leiden | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-90-04-14945-8 | chapter=The Staurogram in Early Christian Manuscripts: the earliest visual reference to the crucified Jesus? | first=Larry| last=Hurtado| authorlink=Larry W.

[[Ephrem the Syrian]] in the 4th-century explained these two united letters stating that the tau refers to the [[Christian cross|cross]], and the rho refers to the Greek word "help" ({{lang|grc|Βoήθια}} [[sic|[sic]]]; proper spelling: {{lang|grc|Βoήθεια}}) which has the [[Numerology|numerological]] value in Greek of 100 as the letter rho has. In such a way the symbol expresses the idea that the Cross saves.&lt;ref name="Hurtado"/&gt; The two letters tau and rho can also be found separately as symbols on early Christian [[ossuaries]].&lt;ref name="Bagatti"/&gt;

The image of the Good Shepherd, often with a sheep on his shoulders, is the most common of the symbolic [[Depiction of Jesus|representations of Christ]] found in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], and it is related to the [[Parable of the Lost Sheep]]. Initially it was also understood as a symbol like others used in [[Early Christian art]]. By about the 5th century the figure more often took on the appearance of the conventional depiction of Christ, as it had developed by this time, and was given a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] and rich robes.

===Dove===

[[File:Rom, Domitilla-Katakomben, Steintafel mit Taube und Ölzweig.jpg|thumb|A dove with an olive branch, [[Catacombs of Rome#Catacombs of Domitilla|Catacombs of Domitilla]], [[Rome]]]]
The [[dove]] as a Christian symbol is of very frequent occurrence in ancient ecclesiastical art.&lt;ref name="ces dove"&gt;{{CathEncy |wstitle=Dove| author=Arthur Barnes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to {{bibleverse||Matthew|3:16|ESV}}, during the [[Baptism of Jesus]] the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] descended like a dove and came to rest on Jesus. For this reason the dove became a symbol of the Holy Spirit and in general it occurs frequently in connection with early representations of baptism. It signifies also the Christian [[soul]], not the human soul as such, but as indwelt by the Holy Spirit; especially, therefore, as freed from the toils of the flesh and entered into rest and glory.&lt;ref name="ces"/&gt; The [[Peristerium]] or ''Eucharistic dove'' was often used in the past, and sometime still used in [[Eastern Christianity]], as [[Church tabernacle]].

However the more ancient explanation of the dove as a Christian symbol refers to it as a symbol of [[Christ]]: [[Irenaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;Irenaeus, Adv Haer, 1.15.6&lt;/ref&gt; in the 2nd century explains that the number 801 is both the [[Numerology|numerological]] value of the sum in Greek of the letters of the word "dove" (Greek: {{lang|grc|περιστερά}}) and the sum of the values of the letters [[Alpha and Omega]], which refers to Christ. In the Bible story of [[Noah's Ark|Noah and the Flood]], after the flood a dove returns to [[Noah]] bringing an [[olive branch]] as a sign that the water had receded, and this scene recalled to the [[Church Father]]s Christ who brings salvation through the cross. This biblical scene led to interpreting the dove also as a [[Peace symbols|symbol of peace]].

===Peacock===

[[File:Langobardic - Ciborium Fragment - Walters 27563.jpg|thumb|Two peacocks, symbolizing paradise and immortality, on a fragment from an eighth century [[Ciborium (architecture)|ciborium]] from a church in Italy]]
Ancient Greeks believed that the flesh of [[peafowl]] did not decay after death, and so it became a symbol of immortality. This symbolism was adopted by early Christianity, and thus many early Christian paintings and mosaics show the peacock. The peacock is still used in the Easter season especially in the east.&lt;ref&gt;"Birds, symbolic." Peter and Linda Murray, Oxford Dictionary of Christian Art (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
The "eyes" in the peacock's tail feathers symbolise the all-seeing God and - in some interpretations - the Church.
A peacock drinking from a vase is used as a symbol of a Christian believer drinking from the waters of eternal life.
The peacock can also symbolise the cosmos if one interprets its tail with its many "eyes" as the vault of heaven dotted by the sun, moon, and stars.
By adoption of old Persian and Babylonian symbolism, in which the peacock was associated with Paradise and the Tree of Life, the bird is again associated with immortality. In Christian iconography the peacock is often depicted next to the Tree of Life.

In [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Europe]], the [[pelican]] was thought to be particularly attentive to her young, to the point of providing her own blood by wounding her own breast when no other food was available.

===Anchor [[File:Anchor pictogram.svg|20px]] [[File:Mariner%27s_Cross.svg|20px]]===

Christians adopted the [[anchor]] as a symbol of hope in future existence because the anchor was regarded in ancient times as a symbol of safety. For Christians, Christ is the unfailing hope of all who believe in him: [[Saint Peter]], [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], and several of the early [[Church Fathers]] speak in this sense. The [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|6:19-20|KJV}} for the first time connects the idea of hope with the symbol of the anchor.&lt;ref name="CEanchor"&gt;{{CathEncy |wstitle=The Anchor (as Symbol)| author=Maurice Hassett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fragment of inscription discovered in the [[Catacombs of Rome|catacomb of St. Domitilla]] contains the anchor, and dates from the end of the 1st century. During the 2nd and 3rd centuries the anchor occurs frequently in the epitaphs of the catacombs. The most common form of anchor found in early Christian images was that in which one extremity terminates in a ring adjoining the cross-bar while the other ends in two curved branches or an arrowhead; There are, however, many deviations from this form.&lt;ref name="CEanchor"/&gt; In general the anchor can symbolize hope, steadfastness, calm and composure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Klöpping| first=Laura | year=2012 |publisher=GRIN Verlag |isbn=978-3-656-13453-4 |page= 5 |title=Customs, Habits and Symbols of the Protestant Religion }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shamrock [[File:Shamrock_svg.svg|2x|22x22px]]===

[[File:Kilbennan St. Benin's Church Window St. Patrick Detail 2010 09 16.jpg|thumb|left|St. Patrick depicted with shamrock in detail of stained glass window in St. Benin's Church, Wicklow, Ireland]]
Traditionally, the [[shamrock]] is said to have been used by [[Saint Patrick]] to illustrate the Christian doctrine of the [[Holy Trinity]] when [[Christianization|Christianising]] Ireland in the 5th century.

The low, dense, tangled, growing habit of shamrock plants creates a short, but expansive, mat of soft green stems and leaves. The tangled mats of vegetation are formed as the densely-packed sprouting stems meander, twist, and curve around one another, seeking space where the leaves may unfold and remain exposed to sunlight.

Shamrocks do not demand nutrient-dense soil, and which can withstand temporary, sudden, environmental moisture and temperature extremes. Shamrocks thrive where dappled, indirect, or partially screened sunlight, lasts for many hours of the day; however, shamrocks can survive a broad range of lighting conditions. Shamrocks can tolerate full exposure, to bright, hot Sunlight which would scorch many other temperate climate plants, so long as they are partially shaded for a couple of hours, at some point between dawn and dusk. They may also grow in full shade, such as under trees at woodland edges; though they do not grow in dark, or 'deep,' shade. 

The environmental conditions, to which shamrocks are best suited, include a thin veil of cloud cover; sporadic instances, of momentary exposure to bright sunlight, throughout the day; mild daylight warmth; mildly cool nights; and consistent, gentle, light rainfall. Soil richness and pH may vary without much effect on the plant's health. 

The temperature-mitigating effects of the Atlantic Ocean are significant along the European continental shelf. Tropical waters, displaced by North-North-Easterly-moving currents above the Doldrums, enter the North Atlantic Current. The NAC pushes the warm waters North, towards the Irish Sea. Consequently, the temperatures on Ireland are not only buffered from extreme ranges by the surrounding ocean; Ireland is warmed, slightly, by displaced Tropical waters, as well as subject to frequent, often gentle, rainfall.

Ireland's temperate climate, features mild summers, and seasonal, extreme, weather events are infrequent during winter. The mild, naturally irrigated, Irish climate is thus conducive to the growth and reproduction of shamrock plants. The common presence of peat bogs on Ireland acidifies stormwater. Runoff is enabled by Ireland's rolling hills, as it's channeled through the crevices of natural topographical rises, and flows, drawn by the force of gravity, down geological dips, into streams and lowland fields. The stormwater runoff near peat bogs causes the soil in the surrounding areas to have low in pH value; though tolerance of acidic soils allows shamrocks to thrive where plants requiring neutral soil cannot grow.

The Burren region of Ireland is a plateau-like area of exposed bedrock (and thus, sparse vegetation) higher above sea-level than many other of the island's regions; and illustrates the close proximity of solid bedrock to the island's soil surfaces. Soil depth is nearly inconsequential for the hardy shamrock, as the growth habit of shamrock plant roots mirrors that of shamrock stems: fine, laterally wandering, tangled roots, reach through mere centimeters of topsoil to meet the low water and nutrient demands of the shamrock stems and leaves.

The shamrock is so commonly seen growing on the island of Ireland, the very hue of the plant's chlorophyll is a symbol of Ireland itself - both in terms of the appearance of physical island; and as a representation the Irish culture, shaped by a long, historical accumulation, and integration, of diverse domestic and foreign influences. The low, dense, tangled, growing habit of shamrock plants creates a short, but expansive, mat of green, which colors the fields, hills, and forest edges of Ireland; hence the nickname, the Emerald Isle.

The Christianization, of the previously Celtic Druidic island culture, began in the 4th century, CE. Christianization continued to dramatically influence, and change, Irish cultural practices and schools of thought, through the 6th century, CE - whereupon the Holy Roman Empire's assimilative dominion over Ireland, beyond the Pale, was essentially total. It is said that St. Patrick, born in Britain, in a Roman Imperial settlement, to parents loyal to the Empire, spread Christianity throughout Ireland. 

St. Patrick used the shamrock - a small plant with compound leaves, typically composed of three (3), heart-shaped leaflets; and, a very familiar sight to the Irish - to illustrate the tripartite form of the Christian deity. Unlike many other tripartite mythologies, such as the native Irish Morrigan mythology, Christianity is a monotheistic religion. The common triple-leaflet, compound-leaved shamrock, which exhibits only one compound-triplet leaf per stem, provided St. Patrick a means of exemplifying the meaning of the singular yet tripartite Christian god. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, were described by St. Patrick as being a single god; comparable to each of the three leaflets, which, together, form one shamrock.

===Elemental symbols===

[[Classical elements|Elemental]] symbols were widely used by the [[early Church]]. Water has specific symbolic significance for Christians. Outside of baptism, water may represent cleansing or purity. Fire, especially in the form of a candle flame, represents both the [[Holy Spirit]] and light. The sources of these symbols derive from the [[Bible]]; for example from the ''tongues of fire'' that symbolized the Holy Spirit at [[Pentecost]], and from Jesus' description of his followers as ''the light of the world''; or ''God is a consuming fire'' found in {{bibleverse||Hebrews|12}}.&lt;ref name="soc"&gt;Dilasser, Maurice. ''The Symbols of the Church'' (1999). Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, hardcover: {{ISBN|0-8146-2538-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lily crucifix===

[[File:Lily Crucifix at Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford.jpg|thumb|Lily Crucifix at [[Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford]], Suffolk]][[File:Trinidad-Anglican-Episcopal-Coat-of-Arms.svg|thumb|right|The coat of arms of the Anglican diocese of Trinidad contains several Christian visual symbols]]
A lily crucifix is a rare symbol of [[Anglican]] churches in England. It depicts Christ crucified on a [[lily]], or holding such a plant. The symbolism may be from the medieval belief that the Annunciation of Christ and his crucifixion occurred on the same day of the year, March 25.&lt;ref&gt;The Passion in Art. Richard Harries. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

There are few depictions of a lily crucifix in England. One of the most notable is a painting on a wall above the altar at [[All Saints' Church, Godshill|All Saint's Church]], [[Godshill]], [[Isle of Wight]]. Other examples include:
*An alabaster example on a tomb in [[St Mary's Church, Nottingham]].
*The [[Lady chapel|Lady Chapel]] of [[Helena (Empress)|St Helen]]'s, [[Abingdon, Oxfordshire]], has a wall painting.
*Five examples are in glass as at [[Holy Trinity Church, Long Melford]].
*At All Saints, [[Great Glemham]], [[Suffolk]], the image is on the base of a [[baptismal font|font]].
*At St Mary, [[Binham]], [[Norfolk]], an image in a bench end may be a lily crucifix.
*In [[Tong, Shropshire]], [[St Bartholomew's Church, Tong|St Bartholomew's Church]] [[choir stall]] No. 8 depicts a lily crucifix.
*The [[Church of St John the Baptist, Wellington]] includes a lily crucifix in the carving of the centre [[mullion]] of the east window of the Lady chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=St John the Baptist, Wellington|url=http://www.wellingtonteamchurches.org.uk/wellingtonChurch.html|publisher=Wellington and District Team Ministry|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tomb paintings==

Christians from the very beginning adorned their [[catacombs]] with paintings of Christ, of the saints, of scenes from the Bible and allegorical groups. The catacombs are the cradle of all Christian art.&lt;ref name="ceimage"&gt;{{cite web  | last =Fortescue  | first =Adrian   | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Veneration of Images | work =Catholic Encyclopedia  | publisher =Robert Appleton Company  | year =1912  | url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07664a.htm   | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Christians accepted the art of their time and used it, as well as a poor and persecuted community could, to express their religious ideas.&lt;ref name="ceimage" /&gt; The use of deep, sometimes labyrinthine, subterranean catacombs for ritual burials are a product of the poverty of early Christian communities: the unusual, multileveled, burial chambers were, at surface-level, small plots of land used as entrances to the tiered catacombs below, by early Christians unable to afford large areas of land, nor the corresponding taxes sometimes levied on real estate, by regional authorities.

From the second half of the 1st century to the time of [[Constantine the Great]] they buried their dead and celebrated their rites in these underground chambers. The Christian tombs were ornamented with indifferent or symbolic designs—palms, peacocks, with the [[Chi Rho|chi-rho]] monogram, with bas-reliefs of Christ as the [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|Good Shepherd]], or seated between figures of saints, and sometimes with elaborate scenes from the New Testament.&lt;ref name="ceimage" /&gt;

Other Christian symbols include the [[dove]] (symbolic of the Holy Spirit), the sacrificial lamb (symbolic of Christ's sacrifice), the [[vine]] (symbolizing the necessary connectedness of the Christian with Christ) and many others. These all derive from the writings found in the New Testament.&lt;ref name="soc" /&gt; Other decorations that were common included garlands, ribands, stars landscapes, which had symbolic meanings, as well.&lt;ref name="ceimage" /&gt;

==Symbols of Christian Churches==
[[File:Baptism - Marcellinus and Peter.jpg|thumb|Baptism in early Christian art.]]

===Sacraments===

Some of the oldest symbols within the [[Christian Church]] are the [[sacraments]], the number of which vary between denominations.  Always included are [[Eucharist]] and [[baptism]].  The others which may or may not be included are   [[ordination]], [[Anointing of the Sick|unction]], [[confirmation]], [[penance]] and [[Christian views of marriage|marriage]].  They are together commonly described as ''an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace'' or, as in the Roman Catholic system, "outward signs and media of grace."&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;{{cite web  | last =Kennedy  | first =D.J  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Sacraments  | work =Catholic Encyclopedia  | publisher =Robert Appleton Company  | year =1912  | url =http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13295a.htm#IV   | doi =  | accessdate = 2007-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rite is seen as a symbol of the spiritual change or event that takes place. In the Eucharist, the bread and wine are symbolic of the body and shed blood of [[Jesus]], and in Roman Catholicism, become the ''actual'' [[Body of Christ]] and [[Blood of Christ]] through [[Transubstantiation]].&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt;

The rite of baptism is symbolic of the cleansing of the sinner by God, and, especially where baptism is by immersion, of the spiritual death and resurrection of the baptized person. Opinion differs as to the symbolic nature of the sacraments, with some [[Protestant]] denominations considering them entirely symbolic, and [[Roman Catholic]]s, Orthodox, Lutherans, and some Reformed Christians believing that the outward rites truly do, by the power of God, act as media of grace.&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt;

===Icons===

The tomb paintings of the early Christians led to the development of [[icon]]s. An icon is an image, picture, or representation; it is likeness that has symbolic meaning for an object by signifying or representing it, or by analogy, as in [[semiotics]]. The use of icons, however, was never without opposition. It was recorded that, "there is no century between the fourth and the eighth in which there is not some evidence of opposition to images even within the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Ernst | last = Kitzinger | title = The Cult of Images in the Age before Iconoclasm | place = Dumbarton Oaks | year = 1954}}, quoted by {{Citation | first = Pelikan | last = Jaroslav | title = The Spirit of Eastern Christendom 600–1700 | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=August 2015}} Nonetheless, popular favor for icons guaranteed their continued existence, while no systematic apologia for or against icons, or doctrinal authorization or condemnation of icons yet existed.
[[File:L'abbé Ména et le Christ 01.JPG|thumb|[[Icon of Christ and Abbot Mena|Christ and Saint Menas]], 6th-century Coptic icon, Louvre]] 

Though significant in the history of religious doctrine, the Byzantine controversy over images is not seen as of primary importance in Byzantine history.  "Few historians still hold it to have been the greatest issue of the period..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Patricia | last = Karlin-Hayter | title = Oxford History of Byzantium | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=August 2015}}

The [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]] began when images were banned by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] sometime between 726 and 730. Under his son [[Constantine V]], [[Council of Hieria|a council forbidding image veneration was held at Hieria]] near Constantinople in 754.  Image veneration was later reinstated by the [[Irene (empress)|Empress Regent Irene]], under whom another council was held reversing the decisions of the previous iconoclast council and taking its title as [[Seventh Ecumenical Council]].  The council anathematized all who held to iconoclasm, i.e. those who held that veneration of images constitutes idolatry. Then the ban was enforced again by [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo V]] in 815. And finally icon veneration was decisively restored by [[Theodora (9th century)|Empress Regent Theodora]].

Today icons are used particularly among [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Church of the East|Assyrian]] and [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].

'''Claës Fredrik Hornstedt''' (12 February 1758 [[Linköping]] – May 1809 [[Helsinki]]) was a Swedish naturalist, taxonomist, botanical illustrator and a protégé of [[Carl Peter Thunberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://balticworlds.com/in-the-spirit-of-linnaeus-and-the-footsteps-of-thunberg-the-last-research-voyage/ Baltic Worlds]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hornstedt received a thorough education in natural history at the [[University of Uppsala]]. His 1781 dissertation dealt with plants collected in Japan by his teacher and mentor, Thunberg. At the invitation of Thunberg he set off in 1783 for [[Jakarta|Batavia]], capital of the Dutch colonial empire, from Göteborg, boarding the “Sophia Magdalena”, a ship belonging to the [[Swedish East India Company]]. Supported by the Batavian Society of Arts and Sciences, he began collecting natural history specimens, mounted expeditions to the interior and neighbouring islands, and learnt the [[Malay language]] and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. His letters show a growing disaffection with the European way of life and its prodigality. He wore Chinese clothing, ate Chinese food and frequented the Chinese quarter.

Hornstedt left [[Java]] in August 1784, suffering the after-effects of malaria and jaundice, but even so managed to return with an impressive collection of natural history and ethnological objects. His collection also contained a set of medical drawings based on a Japanese medical text. These drawings were given to him by [[Isaac Titsingh]] who had come back to Batavia after his second trip to the East India Company's Station at [[Dejima]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostindiskakompaniet.se/personbeskrivning/hornstedt-fredrik-claes/ Swedish East India Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

After brief visits to the [[Netherlands]], [[France]] and [[Denmark]] in 1786, he studied for a degree in medicine at the German [[University of Greifswald]]. Once back in Sweden he was appointed counselor and lecturer in Natural History at the museum in Linköping in 1787. He enlisted in the Swedish navy in 1796, and became a prisoner of war in the [[Finnish War|Swedish-Russian War]] of 1808. He then became head physician at a Russian [[lazaret]] on [[Suomenlinna]] fortress.

{{botanist|Hornst.|border=0}}. The plant genus ''[[:fr:Hornstedtia|Hornstedtia]]'' in the family [[Zingiberaceae]] is named in his honour.

[[File:Design Management in brief.jpg|thumb|Design management is the business side of design. Design managers need to speak the language of the business and the language of design.]]
'''Design management''' is a field of inquiry that uses [[project management]], [[design]], strategy, and [[supply chain]] techniques to control a [[creative process]], support a culture of [[creativity]], and build a structure and organization for design. The objective of design management is to develop and maintain an efficient business environment in which an organization can achieve its [[Strategic planning|strategic]] and [[mission statement|mission]] goals through design. Design management is a comprehensive activity at all levels of business (operational to strategic), from the discovery phase to the execution phase. "Simply put, design management is the business side of design. Design management encompasses the ongoing [[Business process|processes]], business decisions, and [[strategies]] that enable innovation and create effectively-designed [[Product (business)|products]], [[Service (economics)|services]], [[communications]], [[Social environment|environments]], and [[brands]] that enhance our quality of life and provide organizational success."&lt;ref name="DMI2010web" /&gt; The discipline of design management overlaps with [[marketing management]], [[operations management]], and [[strategic management]].

Traditionally, design management was seen as limited to the management of design projects, but over time, it evolved to include other aspects of an organization at the functional and strategic level. A more recent debate concerns the integration of [[design thinking]] into [[strategic management]] as a cross-disciplinary and human-centered approach to management. This paradigm also focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an [[Abductive reasoning|abductive mode of inference]], compared to practices associated with the more traditional management paradigm.&lt;ref name="jones_2008" /&gt;

Design has become a strategic asset in [[brand equity]], differentiation, and product quality for many companies. More and more organizations apply design management to improve design-relevant activities and to better connect design with corporate strategy.

==Extended definition==
[[File:Dm-definition.pdf|thumb|right| Design management plays three integrative key roles in the interface of design, organization and market.]]
The multifaceted nature of design management leads to varied opinion,&lt;ref name="Koppelmann1993" /&gt; making it difficult to give an overall definition; furthermore, design managers have a broad range of roles and responsibilities. These factors, combined with a multitude of other influences such as the industry involved, company size, the market situation, and the importance of design within the organization's activities. As a result, design management is not restricted to a single design discipline and usually depends on the context of its application within an individual organization.

On an abstract level, design management plays three key roles in the interface of design, organization, and market. The three key roles are to:

# Align design strategy with corporate or brand strategy, or both
# Manage quality and consistency of design outcomes across and within different design disciplines (design classes)
# Enhance new methods of user experience, create new solutions for user needs and differentiation from competitor's designs

===Additional definitions===
{{quote|Design management is the effective deployment by line managers of the design resources available to an organization in the pursuance of its corporate objectives. It is therefore directly concerned with the organizational place of design, with the identification with specific design disciplines which are relevant to the resolution of key management issues, and with the training of managers to use design effectively.|Peter Gorb&lt;ref name="Peter Gorb" /&gt;}}
{{quote|Design management is a complex and multi-faceted activity that goes right to the heart of what a company is or does [...] it is not something susceptible to pat formulas, a few bullet points or a manual. Every company's structure and internal culture is different; design management is no exception. But the fact that every firm is different does not diminish the importance of managing design tightly and effectively.|John Thackara&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p139" /&gt;}}

==Definition of related terms==

===Design===
{{Main|Design}}
Unlike unique sciences such as mathematics, the perspective, activity, or discipline of design is not brought to a generally accepted common denominator. The historical beginnings of design are complex and the nature of design is still the subject of ongoing discussion.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph, P., and Wand, Y. A Proposal for a Formal Definition of the Design Concept. In, Lyytinen, K., Loucopoulos, P., [[John Mylopoulos|Mylopoulos, J.]], and Robinson, W., (eds.), Design Requirements Engineering: A Ten-Year Perspective: Springer-Verlag, 2009, pp. 103-136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ralph2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Holm2006" /&gt; In design, there are strong differentiations between theory and practice. The fluid nature of the theory allows the designer to operate without being constrained by a rigid structure. In practice, decisions are often referred to as ''intuition''. In his ''Classification of Design'' (1976), Gorb divided design into three different classes. Design management operates in and across all three classes: product (e.g. [[industrial design]], packaging design, service design), information (e.g. graphic design, branding, media design, web design), and environment (e.g. retail design, exhibition design, interior design).&lt;ref name="Gorb1988" /&gt;

===Management===
{{Main|Management}}
Management in all business and organizational activities is the act of getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives efficiently and effectively. Management comprises [[planning]], [[organizing (management)|organizing]], [[Human resources|staffing]], [[leadership|leading]] or directing, and [[Control (management)|controlling]] an [[organization]] (a group of one or more people or entities), or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal.&lt;ref name="Fayol1841-1925" group="note" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dunod1966" /&gt; [[Human resources|Resourcing]] encompasses the deployment and manipulation of [[human resources]], [[financial]] resources, [[technological]] resources, and [[natural resources]]. Towards the end of the 20th century, business management came to consist of six separate branches, namely [[human resources|human resource]] management, [[operations management]] (or production management), [[strategic management]], [[marketing management]], [[Corporate finance|financial management]], and [[information technology management]], which was responsible for [[management information systems]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Although it is difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way, it helps in navigating the discipline of management. Design management overlaps mainly with the branches [[marketing management]], [[operations management]], and [[strategic management]].

===Design leadership===
Design managers often operate in the area of [[design leadership]]; however, design management and design leadership are interdependent rather than interchangeable. Like management and leadership, they differ in their objectives, achievements of objectives, accomplishments, and outcomes. Design leadership leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, design management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. Design management requires design leadership to know where to go and design leadership requires design management to know how to get there.&lt;ref name="Turner2002" /&gt;

==History==
Difficulties arise in tracing the history of design management. Even though design management as an expression is first mentioned in literature in 1964,&lt;ref name="M-Farr1965" /&gt; earlier contributions created the context in which the expression could arise. Throughout its history, design management was influenced by a number of different disciplines: architecture, [[industrial design]], management, software development, engineering; and movements such as [[system theory]], [[Design methodology|design methodologies]]. It cannot be attributed directly to either design or to management.

===Business===

====Managing product aesthetics and corporate design (early contributions)====
[[File:Peter Behrens, um 1913.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Behrens]], around 1913 in his office in Berlin, was one of the first contributors to design management.]]
Early contributions to design management show how different design disciplines were coordinated to achieve business objectives at a corporate level, and demonstrate the early understanding of design as a competitive force. In that context, design was merely understood as an aesthetic function, and the management of design was at the level of project planning.

The practice of managing design to achieve a business objective was first documented in 1907. The [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Work Federation) was established in [[Munich]] by twelve architects and twelve business firms as a state-sponsored effort to better compete with Great Britain and the United States by integrating traditional craft and industrial mass-production techniques.&lt;ref name="Schwartz1996" /&gt; A German designer and architect, [[Peter Behrens]], created the entire [[corporate identity]] (logotype, product design, publicity, etc.) of [[AEG|Allgemeine Elektrizitäts Gesellschaft]] (AEG), and is regarded as the first [[industrial design]]er in history.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} His work for AEG was the first large-scale demonstration of the viability and vitality of the Werkbund's initiatives and objectives and can be considered as first contribution to design management.&lt;ref name="Bürdek1989p358" /&gt;

In the following years, companies applied the principles of corporate identity and [[corporate design]] to increase awareness and recognition by consumers and differentiation from competitors. [[Olivetti]] became famous for its attention to design through their corporate design activities.&lt;ref name="Woodham1997" /&gt; In 1936 Olivetti hired Giovanni Pintori in their publicity department and promoted [[Marcello Nizzoli]] from the product design department to develop design in a comprehensive corporate philosophy. In 1956, inspired by the compelling brand character of Olivetti, [[Thomas Watson, Jr.]], CEO of [[IBM]], retained American architect and industrial designer [[Eliot Noyes]] to develop a corporate-wide IBM Design Program consisting of coherent brand-design strategy together with a design management system to guide and oversee the comprehensive brand identity elements of: products, graphics, exhibits, architecture, interiors and fine art. This seminal effort by Noyes, with his inclusion of [[Paul Rand]] and [[Charles Eames]] as consultants, is considered to be the first comprehensive corporate design program in America.&lt;ref name=Noyes&gt;Bruce, G., (2006) ''Eliot Noyes'', London: Phaidon Press Limited.&lt;/ref&gt; Up to and during the 1960s, debates in the design community were focused on [[ergonomics]], functionalism, and corporate design, while debates in management addressed [[Just-in-time (business)|Just in time]], [[Total quality management]], and product specification. The main proponents of design management at that time were AEG, [[Bauhaus]], [[Ulm School of Design|HfG Ulm]], the [[Design Council|British Design Council]], Deutscher Werkbund, Olivetti, IBM, Peter Behrens, and [[Walter Paepcke]].&lt;ref name="Bürdek1989p358" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Noyes/&gt;

====Managing design systematically (1960s–1970s)====
The work of designers in the 1960s was influenced by industry, as the debate on design evolved from an aesthetic function into active cooperation with industry. Designers had to work in a team with engineers and marketers, and design was perceived as one part of the product development process. In the early years, design management was strongly influenced by system science and the emergence of a [[Design Science|design science]] (e.g. the "blooming period of [[Design methodology|design methodologies]]" in Germany, the US, and Great Britain), as its main contributors had backgrounds in architecture. Early discussions on design management were strongly influenced by Anglo-Saxon literature (e.g. [http://www.kengarland.co.uk/KGA-graphic-design/michael-farr/ Farr] and [[Horst Rittel]]), methodological studies in [[Design Research]] (e.g. [[Ulm School of Design|HfG Ulm]] and [[Christopher Alexander]]), and theories in business studies. Design management dealt with two main issues:
* how to develop corporate systems of planning aims
* how to solve problems of methodological [[information processing]]

Instruments and checklists were developed to structure the processes and decisions of companies for successful [[corporate development]].&lt;ref name="Geyer1970p35"/&gt; In this period the main contributors to design management were Michael Farr, Horst Rittel, HfG Ulm, Christopher Alexander, James Pilditch, the [[London Business School]], Peter Gorb, the Design Management Institute, and the [[Royal Society of Arts]]. Debates in design disciplines were focusing on design science, design methodology, [[wicked problems]],&lt;ref name="wicked_problem" group="note" /&gt; Ulm methodology, the relationship of [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41373058 design and business], new German design, and semiotic and scenario technique.

====Managing design as a strategic asset (1980s–1990s)====
In the 1980s several managers realized the economic effect of design,&lt;ref name="Kicherer1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Spieß1993" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rummel1995" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Meier-Kortwig1997" /&gt;&lt;!--Are all these refs really necessary?--&gt; which increased the demand for design management. As companies were unsure how to manage design, there was a market for consultancy; focusing on helping organizations manage the product development process, including [[market research]], product concepts, projects, communications, and market launch phases—as well as the positioning of products and companies.

Three important works were published in 1990: the ''Publication of Design Management – A Handbook of Issues and Methods''&lt;ref name="Oakley1990" /&gt; by Mark Oakley (Editor), the book ''Design Management''&lt;ref name="Mozota1990" /&gt; by French researcher [[Brigitte Borja de Mozota]], and the ''Publication of Design Management – Papers from the London Business School''&lt;ref name="Gorb1990" /&gt; by Peter Gorb (Editor). This new method-based design management approach helped to improve communication amongst technical and marketing managers. Examples of the new methods included trend research, the product effect triad, style mapping, milieus, product screenings, empiric design methods, and service design, giving design a more communicative and central role within organizations.

In the management community the topics of management theory, positioning strategy, brand management, strategic management, advertisement, competitive strategy, leadership, business ethics, mass customization, core competencies, strategic intent, reputation management, and system theory were discussed. Main issues and debates in design management included the topics of design leadership, design thinking, and corporate identity; plus the involvement of design management at the operational, tactical, and strategic levels.

In 1980 Robert Blaich, the senior managing director of design at [[Philips]], introduced a design management system that regards design, production, and marketing as a single unit.&lt;ref name="reddot2004" /&gt; This was an important contribution to the definition of design as a core element in business. At [[Philips Design]], Stefano Marzano became CEO and Chief Creative Director in 1991, continuing the work of Robert Blaich to align design processes with business processes and furthering design strategy as an important asset of the overall business strategy.

Upon being appointed corporate head of the IBM Design Program in 1989, [[Tom Hardy (designer)|Tom Hardy]], initiated a strategic design management effort, in collaboration with IBM design consultant [[Richard Sapper]], to return to the roots of the IBM Design Program first established in 1956 by [[Eliot Noyes]], [[Paul Rand]] and [[Charles Eames]]. The intent was to reprise IBM's brand image with customer experience-driven quality, approachability and contemporary product innovation. The highly successful IBM [[ThinkPad]] was the first product to emerge from this strategy in 1992 and, together with other innovative, award-winning products that followed, served to position design as a strategic asset for IBM's brand turnaround efforts initiated in 1993 by newly appointed CEO Louis V. Gerstner, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, B., ″Hot Products: Smart Design is the Common Thread″, ''Business Week'', June 7, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sakakibara&gt;Sakakibara, K., “IBM ThinkPad 700C Notebook Computer Case″, ''Centre for Design Management - London Business School'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dell, D.; Purdy, G., (1999) ''ThinkPad: A Different Shade of Blue'', Indianapolis: Sams/Mcmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, T., “Rebuilding Trust: Design Saves the Brand″, ''Innovation'', Summer 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, T., “Innovation &amp; Chaos”, ''Design Management Journal'', Summer 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metz, C., ″25 Years of PC Magazine: Year Eleven/1992″, ''PC Magazine'', May 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consultant following his 22-year tenure at IBM, [[Tom Hardy (designer)|Hardy]] served as Corporate Design Advisor to [[Samsung]] &lt;ref&gt;Edwards, C.;  Engardio, P.; Ihlwan, M., "The Samsung Way", ''Business Week'', June 16, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chung, K.; Freeze, K., “Design Strategy at Samsung Electronics: Becoming a Top-Tier Company″, ''Design Management Institute Case Study - Harvard Business School Publishing'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; from 1996-2003 where his integration of a brand-design philosophy and guiding principles, together with a comprehensive design management system, became a strategic corporate asset &lt;ref&gt;Delaney, M.; Hardy, T.; McFarland, J.; Yoon, G., ″Global Localization″, ''Innovation'', Summer 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krishnan, R.; Kumar, K., ″Capturing Value in Global Markets: The Case of Samsung Electronics″, ''SCMS Journal of Indian Management - Indian Institute of Management Bangalore'', October - December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, L., "From Cheap to WOW", ''Case Study, Thunderbird School of Global Management'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; that significantly helped elevate Samsung's image from follower to global brand-design leader and dramatically increased brand equity value.&lt;ref&gt;Bremmer, B.; Ihlwan, M., ″Cool Korea″ [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/02_23/b3786002.htm], '' Business Week'', June 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chung, K.; Hardy, T.; So, S., ″Strategic Realization″ [http://www.dmi.org/dmi/html/publications/journal/fullabstract_d.jsp?itemID=00111HAR65], ''Design Management Journal'', Winter 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, B., “The Hungriest Tiger”, ''Business Week'', June 2, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Managing design for innovation (2000s–2010s)====
Design management has taken a more strategic role within business since 2000, and more academic programs for design management have been established. Design management has been recognized (and subsidized) throughout the [[European Union]] as a function for corporate advantage of both companies and nations.&lt;ref name="ADMIRE2009" group="note" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kootstra2009" /&gt; The main issues and debates included the topics of design thinking, strategic design management, design leadership, and product service systems. Design management was influenced by the following design trends: sustainable design, inclusive design, interactive design, design probes, product clinics, and co-design. It was also influenced by the later management trends of open innovation and design thinking.&lt;ref name="Lockwood2009" /&gt;

===Notion of the term "design management"===
In 1965 the term ''design management'' was first published in a series of articles in the ''Design Journal''. This series includes a pre-publication&lt;ref name="M-Farr1965" /&gt; of the first chapter of the book ''Design Management'' by Michael Farr,&lt;ref name="Farr1996p4" /&gt; which is considered as the first comprehensive literature on design management. His thoughts on [[system theory]] and [[project management]] led to a framework on how to deal with design as a business function at the [[corporate management]] level by providing the language and methodology to effectively manage it.&lt;ref name="Bürdek1989" /&gt;

The term "[[architectural management]]" was coined by the architects Brunton, Baden Hellard and Boobyer in 1964 where they highlighted the tension and synergy between the management of individual projects (job management) and the management of the business (office management).&lt;ref name="Brunton1964" /&gt; Although they did not use the term "design management", they stressed identical issues; while the design community discussed methodologies for design. Christopher Alexander's work played an important role in the development of the design methodology, where he devoted his attention to the problems of form and context; and focused on disassembling complex design challenges into constituent parts to approach a solution. His intention was to bring more rationalism and structure into the solving of design problems.

===Design Policy (up to 2000s)===
[[File:Design Council - Bow Street 1.jpg|thumb|The '''British Design Council''' was founded in 1944 to promote design in the British industry.]]
Design policies have a history reaching back to the end of the 19th century, when design programs with roots in the crafts sector were implemented in Sweden (1845) and Finland (1875).&lt;ref name="DMIjournal2010winter" /&gt; In 1907 the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] (German Work Federation) was established in [[Munich]] to better compete with Great Britain and United States. The success of the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] inspired a group of British designers, industrialists and business people after they had seen the Werkbund Exhibition in Cologne in 1914, to found the Design and Industries Association and campaign for a greater involvement of government in the promotion of good design.&lt;ref name="Brighton" /&gt; In 1944 design management by managing design policies was used by the British Government. The British Design Council was founded by Hugh Dalton, president of the Board of Trade in the British wartime government, as the [[Council of Industrial Design]] with the objective "to promote by all practicable means the improvement of design in the products of British industry".

Germany also realized the national importance of design during World War II. Between 1933 and 1945 [[Adolf Hitler]] used design, architecture and propaganda to increase his power; shown through the annual [[Reichsparteitage]] in [[Nürnberg]] on September 5. [[Heinrich Himmler]] coordinated several design activities for Hitler, including: the all-black SS-uniform designed by Professor [[Karl Diebitsch]] and Walter Heck in 1933; the [[Dachau concentration camp]], designed by [[Theodor Eicke]], and prototypes for other [[Nazi concentration camps]]; and the [[Wewelsburg]] redesign commissioned by Heinrich Himmler in 1944.

Since the 1990s the practice of design promotion evolved, and governments have used policy management and design management to promote design as part of their efforts of fostering technology, manufacturing and innovation.&lt;ref name="DMIjournal2010winter" /&gt;

===Promotion and conference (till 2000s)===
[[File:DMI conference.jpg|thumb|right|The 15th European International '''Design Management Conference''' organized by the Design Management Institute]]

In America the [[Chicago]] industrialist [[Walter Paepcke]], of the [[Container Corporation of America]], founded the Aspen Design Conference after World War II as a way of bringing business and designers together – to the benefit of both. In 1951 the first conference topic, "Design as a function of management", was chosen to ensure the participation of the business community. After several years, business leaders stopped attending because the increased participation of designers changed the dialogue, focusing not on the need for collaboration between business and design, but rather on the business community's failure to understand the value of design.&lt;ref name="aspen2011" /&gt;

The [[Royal Society of Arts]] (RSA) Presidential Medals for Design Management were instituted in June 1964. These were to recognize outstanding examples of design policy in organizations that maintained a consistently high standard in all aspects of design management, throughout all industries and disciplines. With these awards the RSA introduced the term ''design management''. In 1965 the first medals were given to four companies; Conran &amp; Co Ltd, Jaeger &amp; Co Ltd, [[Hille (furniture)|S. Hille &amp; Co Ltd]] and W. &amp; A. Gilbey Ltd.&lt;ref name="Cheetman1965" /&gt; in the category "current achievements" and two companies [[London Transport (brand)|London Transport]]&lt;ref name="Hughes-Stanton1965v5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes-Stanton1965v5note" group="note" /&gt; and Heal and Son Ltd.&lt;ref name="Hughes-Stanton1965v7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hughes-Stanton1965v7note" group="note" /&gt; in the category "long pioneering in the field of design management". The medal selection committee included representatives of the RSA council and the faculty of [[Royal Designers for Industry]].

The Design Management Institute (DMI) was founded in 1975 at the [[Massachusetts College of Art]] in [[Boston]]. Since the mid-1980s the DMI has been an international [[non-profit organization]] that seeks to heighten the awareness of design as an essential part of [[business strategy]], and become the leading resource and international authority on design management. One year later the first conference was organized. The DMI increased its international presence and established the "European International Conference on Design Management" in 1997, and a professional development program for design management.&lt;ref name="DMI2010web" /&gt;

In 2007 the [[European Commission]] funded the Award for Design Management Innovating and Reinforcing Enterprises (ADMIRE) project for two years, as part of the Pro Inno Europe Initiative, which is the EU's "focal point for innovation policy analysis, learning and development". The aim was to encourage companies – especially [[small and medium enterprises]] (SMEs) – to introduce design management procedures to; improve their competitiveness, stimulate innovation, establish a European knowledge-sharing platform, organize the [[Design Management Europe Award]], and to identify and test new activities to promote Design Management.&lt;ref name="EU2009" /&gt;

===Education (1970s on)===
[[File:London - The Royal Society of Arts.jpg|thumb|The '''Royal Society of Arts''' in London is one of the first institutions supporting design management.]]
Teaching design to managers was pioneered at the [[London Business School]] (LBS) in 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorb|first=Peter|date=1987|title=Projects Not Cases: Teaching Design to Managers|url=http://mlq.sagepub.com/content/18/4/299|journal=Management Learning|doi=10.1177/135050768701800408|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Peter Gorb (1926-2013), the first Honorary Fellow of the DMI and a long-standing Fellow of the RSA. Gorb had previously embedded design management in the Burton Retail Group before joining LBS where he later founded the Design Management Unit in 1982 (in collaboration with Charles Handy) which he led for over 20 years. In 1979 his talk at the RSA entitled ''Design and its Use by Managers''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorb|first=Peter|date=1980|title=Design and its Use to Managers|jstor=41373058|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Arts|volume=128|issue=5283|pages=144–158}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided a background introduction to the wide scope of design within industry and commerce, an appreciation of the power of design as a management resource, and advocated the teaching of design to managers.&lt;ref&gt;Gorb, Peter (1986) The Business of Design Management, Design Studies, Volume 7, Issue 2, pp.106-110 https://doi.org/10.1016/0142-694X(86)90023-2&lt;/ref&gt; Gorb produced two books based on seminars at the Design Management Unit at LBS, ''Design Talks'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design Talks|last=Gorb|first=Peter|publisher=Design Council|year=1988|isbn=0850722187|location=UK|pages=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;(1988) with Eric Schneider and ''Design Management: Papers from the London Business School'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Design Management: Papers from the London Business School|last=Gorb|first=Peter|publisher=Phaidon Press|year=1990|isbn=1854541536|location=UK|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;(1990). Gorb is also remembered as introducing the concept of Silent Design,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorb|first=Peter|last2=Dumas|first2=Angela|date=1987-07-01|title=Silent design|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0142694X87900378|journal=Design Studies|volume=8|issue=3|pages=150–156|doi=10.1016/0142-694X(87)90037-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; design undertaken by non-designers, in an influential paper with Angela Dumas (1987).

In 1991 the [[University of Art and Design Helsinki]] founded the Institute of Design Leadership and Management and established an international training program.&lt;ref name="TAIKweb2010" /&gt; The International Design Management Conference was organized in the same year by them.&lt;ref name="TAIKconf1995note" group="note" /&gt; In 1995 the [[Helsinki School of Economics]] (HSE), University of Art and Design Helsinki (TaiK), and [[University of Technology]] (TKK) cooperated to create the International Design Business Management Program ([[IDBM]]), which aims to bring together experts from different fields within the concept of design business management.&lt;ref name="Karjalainen2008" /&gt;

===Research===
The first international research project on design management, the TRIAD research project, was initiated by Earl Powell, then president of DMI and the [[Harvard Business School]] in 1989. In the same year Earl Powell and Thomas Walton, Ph.D. developed the Design Management Review and DMI published the first issue. The publication is solely focusing on design management and has become the flagship publication of the discipline.&lt;ref name="TRIAD1989" /&gt;

Design and design management have experienced different generations of theories. In its first generation design focused on the object, in the second on the process, and in the third on the user.&lt;ref name="Findeli2005" /&gt; Similar shifts can be seen in management and design management in almost parallel steps. For design management this has been illustrated by Brigitte Borja de Mozota,&lt;ref name="Mozota2006" /&gt; using Findeli's Bremen Model as a framework. Design management research organised itself into:&lt;ref name="mozota2002" /&gt;
* Organizational studies: design in an economic sector&lt;ref name="designstudies_economic" group="note" /&gt; or design in large firms, such as Philips or Olivetti&lt;ref name="designstudies_companies" group="note" /&gt;
* Descriptive studies of specific methods of design management&lt;ref name="designstudies_descriptive" group="note" /&gt;
It is difficult to predict where design management research is heading.&lt;ref name="Johansson2008" /&gt;

==Different types==
Different types of design management depend on the type and strategic orientation of the business.

===Product design management===
[[File:Saab hockey stick.jpg|thumb|'''Product design management''' helps to create a distinctive design. The [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] hockey stick is an automotive design feature.]]
In product-focused companies, design management focuses mainly on product design management, including strong interactions with product design, product marketing, research and development, and new product development. This perspective of design management is mainly focused on the aesthetic, semiotic, and ergonomic aspects of the product to express the product's qualities and to manage diverse product groups and product design platforms&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt; and can be applied together with a [[user-centered design]] perspective.&lt;ref name="Simeone2014" /&gt;

===Brand design management===
In market and brand focused companies, design management focuses mainly on brand design management, including corporate brand management and product brand management. Focusing on the brand as the core for design decisions results in a strong focus on the brand experience, customer touch points, reliability, recognition, and trust relations. The design is driven by the brand vision and strategy.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt;

;Corporate brand design management

Market and brand focused organizations are concerned with the expression and perception of the corporate brand. Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the corporate identity, or brand. This type of brand management is strongly anchored in the organization to control and influence corporate design activities. The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It is strongly linked to strategy, corporate culture, product development, marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees. A creative culture, knowledge sharing processes, determination, design leadership, and good work relations support the work of corporate brand management.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt;

;Product brand design management

The main focus of product brand management lies on the single product or product family. Product design management is linked to research and development, marketing, and brand management, and is present in the [[fast-moving consumer goods]] (FMCG) industry. It is responsible for the visual expressions of the individual product brand, with its diverse customer–brand touch points and the execution of the brand through design.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt;

===Service design management===
[[File:Car2Go in Austin.jpg|thumb|'''Service design management''' deals with the newly emerging discipline of service design. An example is the [[Car2Go]] concept from [[Daimler AG]], as seen in [[Austin, Texas]].]]
Service design management deals with the newly emerging field of [[service design]]. It is the activity of planning and organizing people, infrastructure, communication, and material components of a service. The aim is to improve the quality of the service, the interaction between the service provider and its customers, and the customer's experience. The increasing importance and size of the service sector in terms of people employed and economic importance requires that services should be well-designed in order to remain competitive and to continue to attract customers. Design management traditionally focuses in the design and development of manufactured products; service design managers can apply many of the same theoretical and methodological approaches. Systematic and strategic management of service design helps the business gain competitive advantages and conquer new markets. Companies that proactively identify the interests of their customers and use this information to develop services that create good experiences for the customer will open up new and profitable business opportunities.

Companies in the service sector innovate by addressing the intangibility, heterogeneity, inseparability, and perishability of service (the IHIP challenge):&lt;ref name="Regan1963" /&gt;
* Services are ''intangible''; they have no physical form and they cannot be seen before purchase or taken home.
* Services are ''heterogenous''; unlike tangible products, no two service delivery experiences are alike.
* Services are ''inseparable''; the act of supplying a service is inseparable from the customer's act of consuming it.
* Services are ''perishable''; they can not be inventoried.

Service design management differs in several ways from product design management. For example, the application of international trading strategies of services is difficult&lt;ref name="Morelli2006" /&gt; because the evolution of service 'from a craftsmanship attitude to industrialization of services' requires the development of new tools, approaches, and policies. Whereas goods can be manufactured centrally and delivered around the globe, services have to be performed at the place of consumption, which makes it difficult to achieve global quality consistency&lt;ref name="Lovelock2001" /&gt; and effective cost control.

===Business design management===
{{Main|Design thinking}}
[[File:Business Model Canvas.png|thumb|right|'''Business design management''' is used in the development of business models. The business model canvas by Alexander Osterwalder.]]
Business design management deals with the newly emerging field of integrating design thinking into management. In organisation and management theory, design thinking forms part of the Architecture / Design / [[Anthropology]] (A/D/A) paradigm which characterizes innovative, human-centered enterprises. This paradigm focuses on a collaborative and iterative style of work and an adductive mode of thinking, compared to practices associated with the more traditional [[Mathematic]]s / [[Economic]]s / [[Psychology]] (M/E/P) management paradigm.&lt;ref name="jones_2008"/&gt; Since 2006, the term ''Business Design'' is trademarked by the [[Rotman School of Management]]; they define business design as the application of design thinking principles to business practice. The designerly way of problem solving is an integrative way of thinking that is characterized by a deep understanding of the user, creative resolution of tensions, collaborative prototyping, and continuous modification and enhancement of ideas and solutions. This approach to problem solving can be applied to all components of business, and the management of the problem solving process forms the core of business design management activity. Universities other than the Rotman School of Management are offering similar academic education concepts, including the [[Aalto University]] in Finland, which initiated their International Design Business Management (IDBM) program in 1995.&lt;ref name="TAIKweb2010" /&gt;

===Engineering design management===
Engineering Design Management is a knowledge area within engineering management. It represents the adaptation and application of customary management practices, with the intention of achieving a productive [engineering design process]. Engineering design management is primarily applied in the context of engineering design teams, whereby the activities, outputs and influences of design teams are planned, guided, monitored and controlled. The output of an engineering design process &lt;ref name="Ertas1996"/&gt; is ultimately a description of a technical system.&lt;ref name=Hubka1996 /&gt; That technical system may either be an artifact (technical object), production facility, a process plant or any infrastructure for the benefit of society. Therefore, the domain of engineering design management includes high volume, mass production as well as low-volume, infrastructure.

===Urban design management===
[[File:HafenCity Hafengeburtstag 2009c.jpg|thumb|'''Urban design management''' contributes to the development of urban districts. The newly built [[HafenCity]], [[Hamburg]], Germany.]]
[[Urban design]] management involves mediation among a range of self-interested stakeholders engaged in the production of the [[built environment]]. Such mediation can encourage a joint search for mutually beneficial outcomes or integrative development. Integrative development aims to produce sustainable solutions by increasing stakeholder satisfaction with the process and with the resulting [[urban development]].&lt;ref name="Edelman2007" /&gt;

Conventional [[real estate development]] and [[urban planning]] activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has not been used as a coordinated approach to real estate development, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain of events in the production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.&lt;ref name="Ahlava2008" /&gt;

Urban design management offers prescriptive advice for practitioners trying to organise city planning activities in a way that will increase sustainability by increasing satisfaction levels. Real estate development and urban planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds. They certainly have conflicting interests. Providing prescriptive advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires construction of a framework that accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities. Urban design management provides a common framework to help bring together the conventional practices of urban and regional planning, real estate development, and urban design.

The work on ''Integrative Negotiation Consensus Building''&lt;ref name="Susskind1999" /&gt; and the ''[[Mutual Gains Approach]]''&lt;ref name="Susskind1996" /&gt; provide a helpful theoretical framework for developing the theory of urban design management. [[Negotiation theory]] provides a useful framework for merging the perspectives of urban planning, city design, and real estate project proposals regarding production of the built environment. ''Interests'', a key construct in negotiation theory, is an important variable that will allow integrated development, as defined above, to occur. The path-breaking work of [[Roger Fisher (academic)|Roger Fisher]] and William Ury (1981), ''Getting to yes'', advises negotiators to focus on interests and mutual gains instead of bargaining over positions.&lt;ref name="Fisher1981" /&gt;

===Architectural management===

[[File:Heathrow Terminal 5 - Departures.jpg|thumb|'''Architectural design management''' contributed to the development of [[Heathrow Terminal 5]] and [[Heathrow Express]] by managing the design development and applying visionary leadership.]]
Architectural management can be defined as an ordered way of thinking which helps to realise a quality building for an acceptable cost or as a process function with the aim of delivering greater architectural value to the client and society. Research by Kiran Gandhi describes architectural management as a set of practical techniques for an architect to successfully operate his practice.&lt;ref name="managearchitecture2010" /&gt; The term ''architectural management'' has been in use since the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Brunton1964" /&gt; The evolution of the field of architectural management has not been a smooth affair. Architectural practice was merely considered a business until after the Second World War, and even then practitioners appeared to be concerned about the conflict between art and commerce, demonstrating indifference to management. There was apparent conflict between the image of an architect and the need for professional management of the architectural business. Reluctance to embrace management and business as an inherent part of architectural practice could also be seen in architectural education programmes and publications. It appears that the management of architectural design, as well as architectural management in general, is still not being given enough importance. Architectural management falls into two distinct parts: office or [[practice management]] and [[project management]]. [[Office management]] provides an overall framework within which many individual projects are commenced, managed, and completed. Architectural management extends between the management of the [[design process]], construction, and project management, through to [[Facility management|facilities management]] of buildings in use. It is a powerful tool that can be applied to the benefit of professional service firms and the total building processes, yet it continues to receive too little attention both in theory and in practice.&lt;ref name="Emmitt2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Emmitt2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Emmitt2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boissevain1995" /&gt;

==Business==

===Value for business===
Design plays a vital role in product and brand development, and is of great economic importance for organisations and companies. Creativity and design in particular (as an activity: design skills, methods and processes) play a growing role in creating products and services with high added value to consumers. Design generates 50% of world export revenue in the [[creative industries]]' products (goods and services). The creative industry workforce is 3.1% of total employment in the European Union (EU), which creates a revenue that is 2.6% of the EU gross value. Creative industries have attained an unprecedented average annual growth rate of 8.7 per cent across the EU between 2000 and 2005.&lt;ref name="EU2009_economy-of-culture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EU2009_economy-of-culture_note" group="note" /&gt;

The increasing importance of creative industries (and especially design) in knowledge-intense industries is reflected not only in the policies and studies on EU levels, but has initiated design and creative policies and programmes in the most advanced economies. Furthermore, design and creativity has been recognised on a regional and local level as a driving force for competitiveness, economic growth, job market, and citizen's satisfaction. The investment in creative and cultural industries are considered a significant component of EU growth in the Lisbon Strategy and the Europe 2020 strategy;&lt;ref name="OMC2010" /&gt; and designers are increasingly involved in innovation issues.

To better understand the value of design and its role in innovation, the EU holds a public consultation on the basis of their publication ''Design as a driver of user-centred innovation''&lt;ref name="EU2009" /&gt; and have published the mini-study ''Design as a tool for innovation''.&lt;ref name="Thenint2008" /&gt; The report highlights the importance of design in user-centred innovation and recommends the integration of design into the EU innovation policy. In addition to the design share in the export of all creative industry products, design can also have a positive impact on all business performance indicators; from turnover and profit to market share and competitiveness.&lt;ref name="designfactfinder2011" /&gt; Design management research results can be classified as follows:&lt;ref name="mozota2002" /&gt;
* Design improves the performance of the innovation policy and of the communications policy of the firm&lt;ref name="designvalue_performance" group="note" /&gt;
* Design improves the global performance of the firm; it is a profitable investment&lt;ref name="designvalue_profit" group="note" /&gt;
* Design is a profession that creates value on a macro economic level&lt;ref name="designvalue_macrolevel" group="note" /&gt;
* Design improves the competitive edge of a country in the international competition; it develops exports&lt;ref name="designvalue_export" group="note" /&gt;
* Design can help the restructuring of an economic sector in regional economic policy &lt;ref name="designvalue_economy" group="note" /&gt;

If and how design management is applied in a company correlates with the importance and integration of design in the company, but depends also on industry type, company size, ownership for design and type of competitive competence. A research from the Danish Design Centre (DDC) led to the "Danish Design Ladder", which shows how companies interpreted and applied design in differing depth:&lt;ref name="DDC2011" /&gt;
# Non-design: Companies that do not use design (15% in 2007).
# Design as styling: Companies that use design as styling appearance (17% in 2007).
# Design as process: Companies that integrate design into the development process (45% in 2007).
# Design as innovation: Companies that consider design as key strategic element (21% in 2007).
The research showed that companies that considered design on a higher level of the ladder were constantly growing. Additionally, the Danish Design Centre published an ''Evaluation of the Importance of Design'' in 2006, with the result that most companies considered design as a promoter for innovation (71%), as a growth potential for the company (79%), and to make products more user friendly (71%). With increasing importance of design for the company, design management also becomes more important.

The value of design can be leveraged if it is managed well. Research by Chiva and Alegre shows that there is no link between the level of design investment and business success, but instead a strong correlation between design management skills and business success.&lt;ref name="Chiva2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh1988" /&gt; This means that efficient and effective design management is crucial for maximising the value of design. Effective design management increases the efficiency of operations and process management, has a significant positive impact on process management, improves quality performance (internal and external quality), and increases operating performance.&lt;ref name="Ahire2000" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaynak2003" /&gt; To measure and communicate the value of design management, Borja de Mozota suggests adapting the Balanced Score Card model and structuring the values in the following four categories:&lt;ref name="Mozota2006" /&gt;
* Internal business processes: Design management as an innovation process, providing improvements in company performance and processes. Here, these innovations and processes are totally invisible to outsiders.
* Learning and growing: Beyond advanced design management. Design explicit knowledge is applied to strategic focus and improves the quality of staff.
* Customer and brand: Design management as perception and brand. Design knowledge is applied to corporate difference building and strategic positioning.
* Financial: The historic design management economic model. Design management as an explicit and measurable value for company reputation and stock market performance.

===Relation to other disciplines and departments===
Three different orientations for the choice of design management can be identified in companies. These orientations influence the perception of management and the responsibility of design managers within the organisation. The strategic orientations are; market focus, product focus and brand focus.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt;
* Product-driven organisations often have design responsibility in their research and development (R&amp;D) departments.
* Market-focus driven organisation often have design responsibility in their marketing departments.
* Brand-focus driven organisations often have design responsibility in corporate communication.

Depending on the strategic orientation, design management overlaps with other management branches to differing extents:

[[Marketing management]]: The concepts and elements of brand management overlap with those of design management. In practice, design management can be part of the job profile of a marketing manager, though the discipline includes aspects that are not in the domain of marketing management. This intersection is called "brand design management" and consists of positioning, personality, purpose, personnel, project and practice,&lt;ref name="Kim-Lee_note" group="note" /&gt; where the objective is to increase brand equity.&lt;ref name="Kim-Lee" /&gt;

[[Operations management]]: At the operational level design management deals with the management of design projects. Processes and tools from operations management can be applied to design management in the execution of design projects.

[[Strategic management]]: Due to the increasing importance of design as a differentiator and its supporting role in brand equity, design management deals with strategic design issues and supports the strategic direction of the business or enterprise. The debate on design thinking suggests the integration of design thinking into strategic management. Design thinking and strategic thinking have some commonalities in their characteristics, both are synthetic, [[adductive]], hypothesis-driven, opportunistic, [[dialectic]]al, enquiring and value-driven.&lt;ref name="Wit-Meyer2004" /&gt;

[[Innovation management]]: The value of the coordinating role of design in [[new product development]] has been well documented. Design management can help to improve innovation management, which can be measured by three variables: it reduces time-to-market, by improving sources and communication skills and developing cross-functional innovation; it stimulates networking innovation, by managing product and customer information flows with internal (e.g. teams) and external (e.g. suppliers, society) actors; it improves the learning process by promoting a continuous learning process.&lt;ref name="Mozota2003" /&gt;

===Hierarchy===
Like the management of strategy, design can be managed on three levels: strategic (corporate level or enterprise wide), tactical (business level or individual business units), and operational (individual project level). These three levels have been termed differently by various authors over the last 50 years.

[[File:1961 AMC PRfoto Designers.jpg|thumb| '''Operational design management''' deals, among other things, with individual design projects and teams. Standing by the scale model's left front fender is [[Richard A. Teague|Richard Teague]], a design manager at [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC) in 1961.]]

'''Operational level'''

Operational design management involves the management of individual design projects and design teams. Its goal is to achieve the objectives set by strategic design management. Success of good design management can be measured by evaluating the quality of operational design management outcomes.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt; It includes the selection and management of design suppliers and encompasses the documentation, supervision, and evaluation of design processes and results. It deals with personal leadership, emotional intelligence, and the cooperation with and management of internal communications. Regular management functions, tools, and concepts can often be applied to the management of design on the operational level. It is implemented to achieve specific design objectives and manage the judgment of design proposals. It can help to build brand equity through the consistent creation and implementation of high-quality design solutions that best fit the brand identity and desired consumer experience, in the most efficient way. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this role: operational design manager, senior designer, team leader, visual communication manager, corporate design coordinator, and others.

[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|'''Tactical design management''' deals, among other things, with creating awareness for design issues in the company. Training meeting in an eco-design stainless steel company in Brazil.]]

'''Tactical level'''

Tactical design management addresses the organisation of design resources and design processes. Its goal is to create a structure for design in the company, bridging the gap between objectives set through strategic design management and the implementation of design on the operational level.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt; It defines how design is organised within the company. This includes the use of a central body to coordinate different design projects and activities. It deals with defining activities, developing design skills and competencies, managing processes, systems and procedures, assigning of roles and responsibilities, developing innovative products and service concepts, and finding new market opportunities. Outcomes of tactical design management are related to the creation of a structure for design within the company, to build internal resources and competencies for the implementation of design. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this function: tactical design manager, design director, design &amp; innovation manager, brand design manager, new product development (NPD) manager, visual identity manager, and others.

[[File:BMW Gina Museum.jpg|thumb| '''Strategic design management''' deals, among other things, with envisioning the future. Visionary automotive concept [[BMW GINA]], BMW Museum, [[Munich]], Germany.]]

'''Strategic level'''

[[Strategic design]] management involves the creation of strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic design management is to support and strengthen the corporate visio by creating a relationship between the design and corporate strategy.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt; It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in the corporate strategy formulation process. Strategic design management is responsible for the development and implementation of a corporate design programme that influences the design vision, mission, and positioning. It allows design to interact with the needs of corporate management and focuses on the long-term capabilities of design. Where strategic design management is applied, there is often a strong belief in the potential to differentiate the company and gain competitive advantage by design. As a result, design thinking becomes integrated into the corporate culture. Depending on the type of company and industry the following job titles are associated with this function: [[design strategy|design strategist]], strategic design manager, chief design officer, vice president design and innovation, chief creative officer, innovation design director, and others.

===Role and responsibility===
Design management is not a standard model that can be projected onto every enterprise, nor is there a specific way of applying it that leads to guaranteed success. Design management processes are carried out by humans with different responsibilities and backgrounds, who work in different [[industries]] and enterprises with different sizes and traditions, whilst having different [[target group]]s and markets to serve. Design management is multifaceted, and so are the different applications of and views on design management. The function of design management in an organisation depends on its tasks, authority, and practice.&lt;ref name="DMIjournal1996vol9" /&gt;

'''Task'''

Similar tasks can be grouped into categories to describe the job profile of a design manager. Different categories in management that encompass design were defined by several authors; those tasks occur on all three design management levels (strategic, tactical, and operational):

{| class="wikitable"

|}

'''Authority and position'''

The authority and position of the design management function has a large influence on what the design manager does in his or her daily job. Kootstra (2006) distinguishes design management types by organisational function:&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt; design management as line function, design management as staff function, and design management as support function. Design management as a "line function" is directly responsible for design execution in the "primary" organisational process and can take place on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in the line are authority over and direct responsibility for the result. Design management as a staff function is not directly responsible for design execution in the "primary" organisational process, but consults as a specialist on all levels of the design management hierarchy. The main attributes for design managers in this function are their limited authority and the need to consult line managers and staff. When the design process is defined as a "secondary" organisational process, design management is seen as "supportive function". In this function it has only a supportive character, classifying the design manager as a creative specialist towards product management, brand management, marketing, R&amp;D, and communication.&lt;ref name="Kootstra2006p451" /&gt; Various authors use different concepts to describe the authority and position of design management; they can be grouped as follows:

{| class="wikitable"

==Design Policy (since the 2010s)==
Today, most developed countries have some kind of design promotion programme. The Design Management Institute has dedicated three issues to design policy development.&lt;ref name="DMIjournal2010winter" /&gt; Although initiatives promote design in different complexities, scopes and focuses, specific targets tend to address the following objectives:&lt;ref name="Sotamaa2004" /&gt;
* support business: increase use of design by companies, particularly by small and medium enterprises (SMEs), and grow the design sector (use dimension);
* promote to the public: increase exports of design and attract international investment (international dimension);
* educate designers: improve design education and research (academic dimension).

A very comprehensive analysis on the situation of design on national level in Britain is the Cox review. The chairman of the [[Design Council]], Sir George Cox, published the Cox Review of Creativity in Business&lt;ref&gt;Cox, G (2005) Cox Review of Creativity in Business: Building on the
UK’s strengths. http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100407171211/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/coxreview_index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005 to communicate the competitive advantage of design for the British industry.

Innovation policies have been excessively focused on the supply of technologies, neglecting the demand side (the user). There have been several initiatives by the European Commission to support and research design and design management in recent years.&lt;ref name="ADMIRE2009" group="note" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kootstra2009" /&gt; However, a European-wide policy to support design has never been planned, due to the inconsistencies and differences in design policies in each nation.&lt;ref name="APCI2004" group="note" /&gt; Nonetheless, there are currently plans to include design in the EU innovation policy.

==Education (since the 2000s)==
[[File:London Business School facade.jpg|thumb|Design management was first taught at the London Business School, in 1976.]]
While design management had its origins in business schools, it has increasingly become embedded in the curriculum in design schools, particularly at the postgraduate level. Teaching design to managers was pioneered at the [[London Business School]] in 1976,&lt;ref name="LBSleaflet1989" /&gt; and the first programme of design management at a design school was started in the 1980s at the [[Royal College of Art]] (RCA), DeMontfort, Middlesex, Staffordshire. Although, in the UK, some design management courses have not been sustainable, including those at the RCA, Westminster and Middlesex, other postgraduate courses have flourished including ones at Brunel, [http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/postgraduate-courses/design-management-ma/ Lancaster] and more recently the University of the Arts with each providing a specific point of view on design management.

The Design Leadership Fellowship at the [[University of Oxford]] was founded in 2005. In the same year the Stanford University Institute of Design founded the D-school, a faculty intended to advance multidisciplinary innovation. The Finnish [[Aalto University]] was founded in 2010 and is a merger of the three established Finnish universities – the [[Helsinki School of Economics]] (HSE), University of Art and Design Helsinki (TaiK), and University of Technology (TKK) – that had been cooperating on the IDBM design management program since 1995. Since 2006 the [[Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts]] in Switzerland offers one of the few undergraduate studies in design management, completely taught in English.

''[[BusinessWeek]]'' annually publishes a lists of the best programmes that combine design thinking and business thinking (''D-schools 2009''&lt;ref name="Businessweek_2009_d-school" /&gt; and ''D-school Programmes to Watch 2009''&lt;ref name="Businessweek_2009_d-school_watch" /&gt;). The article ''Finland – World´s Innovation Hot Spot'' in the Harvard Business Review shows the interest of business leaders in the blended education of design and management.&lt;ref name="Havard2011" /&gt; Business Schools (such as the Rotman School of Management, Wharton University of Pennsylvania and MIT Sloan Executive Education) have acted on this interest and developed new academic curricula.

Integrated education models are emerging in the academic world, a model which is referred to as T-shape and π-shaped education.&lt;ref name="Karjalainen" /&gt; T-shaped professionals are taught general knowledge in a few disciplines (e.g. management and engineering) and specific, deep knowledge in a single domain (e.g. design). This model also applies to companies, when they shift their focus from ''small T'' innovations (innovations involving only one discipline, like chemists) to ''big T'' innovations (innovations involving several disciplines, like design, ethnography, lead user, etc.). Like in education, this shift makes breaking down silos of departments and disciplines of knowledge essential.

==Notes==
{{Reflist|group="note"|refs=
&lt;ref name="ADMIRE2009"&gt;The highest awareness in the design management community got the Pro Inno Europe initiative (the EU's "focal point for innovation policy analysis, learning and development"), because it funded the ADMIRE (Award for Design Management Innovating and Reinforcing Enterprises) project. The goal of the project was to stimulate companies to invest in design management and use it as a key driver for innovation and competitiveness (e.g. through the Design Management Award, the DME library and the DME self-assessment tool).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="APCI2004"&gt;In 2004, a representative of the EU{{who|date=November 2018}} intimated that there will never be a design policy at European level pursued by the EU, until the national policies become more effective and consistent across Europe (January 2004, on the APCI conference in Paris)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Hughes-Stanton1965v5note"&gt;With the award [...] London Transport's position as the first great commercial organisation to think of design as a major factor involving all its activities has at last been formally recognised.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Hughes-Stanton1965v7note"&gt;This article discusses the evolution of Heal's from its beginnings as a small firm to its present position as a large store with a high reputation.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Kim-Lee_note"&gt;The elements of design management are: purpose, personnel, Presence, Project and Practice. The elements of brand management are identity, positioning, personality, system and equity. The elements of brand design management are positioning, personality (personality and presence), purpose (identity and purpose), personnel, project and practice, with the objective to increase brand equity.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="EU2009_economy-of-culture_note"&gt;There are 5.885 million workers across the EU in the cultural and creative sector, this are 3.1% of the total employment in the EU. Those workers generate revenue of 654 billion EUR, which is 2.6% of the EU gross value added. The creative industry is on the 3rd place among the economic sectors of the EU and the international trade in creative goods and services experienced an unprecedented average annual growth rate of 8.7 per cent between 2000 and 2005. (see below: EU-Study "The economy of culture in Europe", 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="wicked_problem"&gt;"Wicked problem" is a phrase originally used in social planning to describe a problem that is difficult or impossible to solve because of incomplete, contradictory, and changing requirements that are often difficult to recognize. Moreover, because of complex interdependencies, the effort to solve one aspect of a wicked problem may reveal or create other problems.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name="Fayol1841-1925"&gt;[[Henri Fayol]] (1841–1925) considers management to consist of six [[function (engineering)|functions]]: forecasting, planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating, and controlling. He was one of the most influential contributors to modern concepts of management. (see ''Administration industrielle et générale - prévoyance organization - commandment, coordination – contrôle'', Paris: Dunod, 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Feminist Press''' is an independent nonprofit literary publisher that promotes freedom of expression and social justice. It publishes writing by people who share an activist spirit and a belief in choice and equality. Founded in 1970, the Press began by rescuing “lost” works by writers such as [[Zora Neale Hurston]] and [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], and established its publishing program with books by American writers of diverse racial and class backgrounds. Since then it has also been bringing works from around the world to North American readers. The Feminist Press is the longest surviving women’s publishing house in the world. The Press operates out of the [[City University of New York]] (CUNY).

== Founding and history ==
By the end of the 1960s, both [[Florence Howe]] and her husband Paul Lauter had taught in the [[Freedom Schools]] in Mississippi, and Howe was already attempting to compile a mini-women’s studies curriculum for her writing students at [[Goucher College]] in Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Kathleen|title=Florence Howe|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/howe-florence#bibliography|work=Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia|publisher=Jewish Women's Archive|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the 1970s approached, Howe was convinced that, just as she needed texts for teaching about women, so would other educators. Her initial appeal to a number of university and trade publishers to issue a series of critical feminist biographies&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Florence. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1971/jul/01/feminist-press/?pagination=false "To the Editors"], ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Retrieved January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; proved of no avail. Ultimately, the Baltimore Women’s Liberation, an active local group and publishers of a successful new journal, helped to raise money for the Press’s first publications. On November 17, 1970, the first meeting of the newly formed Press occurred in Florence Howe's living-room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.constantcontact.com/fs044/1101707198155/archive/1106954679579.html "VFA Honors the Founder of The Feminist Press Florence Howe"]. Veteran Feminists of America. Retrieved January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The first book to be published was Barbara Danish’s children's book ''The Dragon and the Doctor'' in 1971.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book | last = Howe | first = Florence | author-link = | title = A Life in Motion | publisher = The Feminist Press | location = New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781558616974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Florence Howe saw her dreams of producing feminist biographies come true with the publication of ''Elizabeth Barrett Browning'' at the end of 1971.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In the Press’s founding years, [[Tillie Olsen]] changed its course dramatically by giving Howe a photocopy of the 1861 pages of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' containing [[Rebecca Harding Davis]]'s anonymously published novella ''[[Life in the Iron Mills]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bosman|first=Julie|title=Tillie Olsen, Feminist Writer, Dies at 94|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/books/03olsen.html?_r=0|accessdate=10 January 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the Press issued this work by Rebecca Harding Davis as the first of its series of rediscovered feminist literary classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Howe | first = Florence | author-link = | title = Lost and found – and what happened next: some reflections on the search for women writers begun by The Feminist Press in 1970 | journal = [[Contemporary Women's Writing]], special issue: The Body | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 136–153 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press|Oxford Journals]] | doi = 10.1093/cww/vpt022 | date = July 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/cww/vpt022 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olsen’s second suggestion, ''[[Daughter of Earth]]'' by [[Agnes Smedley]], and [[Elaine Hedges]]’s suggestion, ''[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]'' by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], were published in 1973, and both of these have become staples of the American literature and women’s studies curriculums since (the 1990 ''[[Norton Anthology of American Literature]]'' included both ''Life in the Iron Mills'' and ''The Yellow Wall-Paper''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe| author-link = |title=A Life in Motion|date=2011|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;). 

In the spring of 1971, Florence and her husband moved to New York.  Howe brought the burgeoning press with her to her newly accepted professorship at Old Westbury.  The President of the school allowed her to operate out of the corridor of a building originally intended as a garage for campus vehicles.  The Press was met with excitement and support from students who worked in the small office in exchange for college work-study.  Two New York City publishing professionals, Verne Moberg and Susan Lowes, contributed to the publication of three volumes of reprinted fiction released in 1972 and 1973, both of which Howe believes to exemplify the Press's enduring commitment to producing course-adoptable books to supplement curriculums dominated by male writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe| author-link = |title=A Life in Motion|date=2011|publisher=|location= |isbn=|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Press continues its commitment to recovering and compiling the important work of otherwise overlooked and unpublished female artists in collections such as ''In Her Own Image''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hedges | first1 = Elaine | last2 = Wendt | first2 = Ingrid | author-link2 = Ingrid Wendt | title = In Her Own Image: Women Working in the Wrts | publisher = The Feminist Press [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill Book Co.]] | location = Old Westbury, New York, NY | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780070204430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Women Writing Africa'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Daymond | first1 = M. J. | title = Women writing Africa, Volume I: The Southern Region | publisher = The Feminist Press | location = New York | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781558614079 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the Feminist Press became a [[501(c)3 organization]] with tax-exempt status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe| author-link =|title=A Life in Motion|date=2011|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1985, the Feminist Press moved to the CUNY campus on East Ninety-Fourth Street following an invitation from the school.  Allowed to maintain an independent staff and board of directors, the Press gratefully welcomed the resources and visibility made available by this partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howe| author-link = |title=A Life in Motion|date=2011|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Jean Casella became the Executive Director of the Press.  She was followed by Gloria Jacobs, former ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'' editor, and [[Jennifer Baumgardner]], Soapbox Inc. cofounder. [[Jamia Wilson]] is the current Executive Director of the Feminist Press, appointed in 2017.

== Today ==
Wilson is both the youngest director in the Press's 47-year history and the first woman of color to head the organization. Under her tutelage, the Press continues its commitment to publishing a broad range of voices. However, the Press has also recently endeavored to extend its reaches beyond merely publishing. In doing so, the Press has hosted a variety of events, conferences, and panels centering on key conversations in feminism.

“I grew up reading Feminist Press books from my mother’s shelf, and they were instrumental in developing my voice as an activist and writer. It’s an honor to join this intergenerational team to enliven the Press’s intersectional vision of publishing unapologetic, accessible texts that inspire action, teach empathy, and build community,” Wilson explained upon her appointment as ED.

The Feminist Press remains rooted in the symbiotic relationship between a publication and its readership. In this exchange, a book not only promotes ideas to its reader, but it also inspires new formulations that could ultimately shape future publications.

The Feminist Press has remained current and relevant within the fast-changing world of modern politics and the rapid evolution of feminism. In 2016, the Press started Amethyst Editions, a queer imprint curated by Michelle Tea that champions emerging queer writers who employ genre-bending narratives and experimental writing styles, and complicates the conversation around American LGBTQ+ experiences beyond a coming out narrative. The Feminist Press also established the Louise Meriwether First Book Prize, a literary prize for debut women and nonbinary authors of color, in partnership with ''TAYO'' literary magazine.

== ''WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly'' ==
The Feminist Press also publishes ''[[WSQ: Women's Studies Quarterly]]'', an interdisciplinary peer-reviewed academic journal. The journal began as ''Women's Studies Newsletter'' in 1972, and in 1981 it was renamed ''Women's Studies Quarterly''.&lt;ref name=About_FP&gt;{{cite web|title=About FP|url=https://www.feministpress.org/about-fp/history | publisher = The Feminist Press |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today it is a biannual release simply called ''WSQ''.  Covering a wide array of thematic subjects within emerging women's studies, the journal has published issues such as "Technologies," "Citizenship," and "Motherhood."  The subject of each issue is considered through various lenses that may include psychoanalytic, legal, queer, and historical interpretations in addition to many others.

'''Figure–ground organization''' is a type of perceptual grouping which is a vital necessity for recognizing objects through vision. In [[Gestalt psychology]] it is known as identifying a ''figure'' from the back''ground''. For example, you see words on a printed paper as the "figure" and the white sheet as the "background".&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, Daniel L., Daniel T. Gilbert, and Daniel M. Wegner. "Chapter 4: Sensation and Perception, Vision II: Recognizing What We Perceive." Psychology. ; Second Edition. N.p.: Worth, Incorporated, 2011. 149-50. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
The most famous example of figure–ground perception is probably the [[Rubin vase|faces–vase drawing that Danish psychologist Edgar Rubin described]].&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, E. (1921) ''Visuell Wahrgenommene Figuren : Studien in psychologischer Analyse''. Kobenhaven: Gyldendalske boghandel.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, E. (2001). Figure and Ground. In Yantis, S.(Ed.), ''Visual Perception''. (pp. 225-229). Philadelphia, Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; This drawing exemplifies one of the key aspects of figure–ground organization, edge-assignment and its effect on shape perception. Notice in the faces/vase drawing, the perceived shape depends critically on the direction in which the border (edge) between the black and white regions is assigned. If the two curvy edges between the black and white regions are assigned inward then the central white region is seen as a vase shape in front of a black background. No faces are perceived in this case. On the other hand, if the edges are assigned outwards, then the two black profile faces are perceived on a white background and no vase shape is perceived. The human visual system will then settle on either of the interpretations of the Rubin vase and alternate between them. Functional brain imaging shows that when people see the Rubin image as a face, there is activity in the temporal lobe, specifically in the face-selective region &lt;ref&gt;Schacter, L.D., Gilbert, D.T., Wegner, D.M. (2011). "Psychology (2nd ed.)." New York, NY: Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasson, U., Hendler, T., Ben Bashat, D., and Malach, R. (2001). Vase or face? A neural correlate of shape-selective grouping processes in the human brain. J. Cogn. Neurosci. 13, 744–753.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perceptual process==
How does the brain decide in a visual scene which item is the figure and which are part of the ground? This perceptual decision can be based on many cues, all of which are of a probabilistic nature. For instance, size helps us distinguish between the figure and the ground, since smaller regions are often (but not always) figures. Object shape can help us distinguish figure from ground, because figures tend to be convex. Movement also helps; the figure may be moving against a static environment. Color is also a cue, because the background tends to continue as one color behind potentially multiple foreground figures, whose colors may vary. Edge assignment also helps; if the edge belongs to the figure, it defines the shape while the background exists behind the shape. But it's at times difficult to distinguish between the two because the edge that would separate figure from ground is really part of neither, it equally defines both the figure and the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Evidently, the process of distinguishing figure from ground (sometimes called figure–ground segmentation) is inherently probabilistic, and the best that the brain can do is to take all relevant cues into account in order to generate a probabilistic best-guess. In this light, [[Bayesian approaches to brain function|Bayesian]] figure–ground segmentation models have been proposed to simulate the probabilistic inference by which the brain may distinguish figure from ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldreich|first=D|author2=Peterson, MA|title=A Bayesian observer replicates convexity context effects in figure–ground perception.|journal=Seeing and perceiving|year=2012|volume=25|issue=3-4|pages=365–95|pmid=22564398|doi=10.1163/187847612X634445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barghout|first=L|author2=Lee, L|title=Perceptual information processing system.|journal=USPatent Patent Application 10/618,543,|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic applications==
Figure–ground organization is used to help artists and designers in composition of a 2D piece. Figure–ground reversal may be used as an intentional [[visual design]] technique in which an existing image's foreground and background colors are purposely swapped to create new images.

==Non-visual==
Figure–ground perception can be expanded from visual perception to include abstract (i.e. non-visual) concepts such as melody/harmony, subject/background and positive/negative space.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=October 2016}} The concept of figure and ground fully depends on the observer and not on the item itself.&lt;ref name="figure and ground"&gt;{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R |title=Psychology the science of behaviour-figure and ground |year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Canada |location=USA |isbn=978-0-205-64524-4 |pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of figure–ground problems==
[[File:Star-jeans.jpg|thumb|Type 2: The actual ground is the figure.]]
There are three types of figure–ground problems:
#The figure and the ground compete.
#The figure should be the ground and the ground should be the figure.
#The figure and ground create an [[optical illusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lohr L. Creating Graphics for Learning and Performance: Lessons in Visual Literacy Cleveland, OH: Prentice-Hall, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Filipino American Theater''' ranges from topics such as [[Filipino people|Filipino]]/[[Filipino-American]] history to modern Filipino issues. The themes for these works were mostly influenced by the Spanish colonial rule as well as the [[American settlement in the Philippines|American colonization]]. 

Philippine theater is composed of pre-colonial performance traditions as well as colonial influences from Spain and the USA. 

Some common subject matter tackled by Filipino theater focuses on the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|historical background of the Philippines]] and the relationship between the [[Philippines]] and the [[United States]]. Some Filipino American productions provides personal, societal and cultural perspective from the past to now. 

==Themes in Filipino American theater==

Some themes for Filipino-American theatrical works are focused on the historical background of the country such as the [[Philippine–American War|Filipino-American War]], [[Martial law|Martial Law]] and the dawn of Filipino independence. 

==Influences in the development of Philippine theater==
The earliest form of theatrical work started with indigenous theater which mainly performs “rituals”. Although these rituals may seem purely cultural, there is also a huge religious influence over these rituals and to this day they are still practiced by specific groups. Other than tribal rituals there are also tribal dances that are practiced depict significant tribal activities within the community.

During the Spanish colonial rule within 1565 to 1898, Filipinos never failed to find a way to cope with this regime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the colonization of Spain, [[Christianity]] heavily influenced the lives of [[Filipinos]] which lead to religious pieces and performances throughout the country. One form influenced by [[Spain]] is called ''komedya'' which varies between two themes: the secular and the religious.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For example, a play called ''Tibag'' which talks about the search of Elena and Constantino for the Cross of Christ is still performed in some towns.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another religious form is the ''sinakulo'' or commonly called the [[Passion of Jesus|passion of Christ]] which is usually performed during the [[Lent|Lenten season]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Between 1878 or 1879 another form of performance called ''sarsuwela'' was introduced to Filipinos.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiongson|first=Nicanor G.|date=Jun 8, 2009|title=Dulaan, an Essay on Philippine Theater|url=http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:81/CC01/NLP00VM052mcd/v7/v1.pdf|journal=Cultural Center of the Philippines|volume=|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main theme of ''sarsuwela'' revolves around the love story between different social classes which made the dramatization more interesting.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ''Dalagang Bukid'' (''1919)'', was the most popular piece of ''sarswela'' within the culture.

During the 19th century, Spain introduced ''drama'' which is a play that is usually done within one act. ''Drama'' mainly focuses on the contemporary lives of Filipinos. ''Drama'' had three subgroups which included: (1) melodrama which aimed to make people cry, (2) comedy which aimed for people to laugh and (3) drama simboliko which taught the audience some symbolism within the storyline.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==American influences in the development of Philippine theater==
From 1901 to 1946, the American colonial regime affected Filipino theater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On November 4, 1901 the Sedition Act was enacted in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ww6XgU2dxZ0C&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=seditious+and+subversive:+theater+of+war&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4n4X_btyEV&amp;sig=4k8ESfTXkMpn9bX4FfPo5PRQZVs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjCxrDb2rrTAhUk_4MKHU_yBG0Q6AEIMDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=seditious&amp;f=false|title=Narrating Race: Asia, (Trans) Nationalism, Social Change|last=Goh|first=Robbie B. H.|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9401207089|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this law it was prohibited for any type of media or speech to go against the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  

During the 1930s Filipinos were exposed to western theater and western classics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During this time, Filipinos adapted to American culture and to American theatrical standards. One influence from the occupation is the development of the performance form called ''bodabil''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which is the vernacular equivalent of "vaudeville." Bodabil is more of a mixture of songs and other type of performances that were popular in the United States. 

==Filipino American theater groups==
One Filipinos American theater company is Ma-Yi Theater Company, started in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crienahouse.com/single-post/2016/10/24/Contribution-of-Filipinos-to-American-Theater-Part-2-Legit-Theater|title=Contributions of Filipinos to American Theater, Part 2: Legit Theater|last=House|first=Criena|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991 the National Asian American Theater Co., Inc (NAATCO) was founded and is also a company that involves Filipino American plays and Filipino American casts. Another organization that organizes Filipino playwrights is Sining Bayan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Filipino American Productions==

Sining Bayan has staged the play "Isuda Ti Muna/They Who Were First" in 1973. It mainly encircles the lives of Filipino agricultural workers in central California. The following year ''Mindanao'' (1974) came out in which talks about the land rights if Filipino Muslims and farmers in Mindanao.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Asian American Playwrights|last=Liu|first=Miles Xian|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=343}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 a play called ''Tagatupad'' came out with a focus on the struggles of antieviction laws within the working class Filipino community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One of the most controversial plays within this time called ''[[Ann Arbor Hospital Murders|The Frame Up of Narciso and Perez]] (1979)'' basically focuses on the murder of Narciso and Perez’ patients at a Veterans Administration Hospital.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the same year, ''Visions of a War bride (1979)'' focused on a Filipina that came to the United States as a war bride.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Years later ''Ti Mangyuna (1981)'' led by a collaboration between the KDP and ILWU Local 142 of Hawaii headlined throughout the community.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With its goal to educate the audience about labor-union drive’s. 

In 1990 ''[[Dogeaters]]'' by Jessica Hagedorn was published which works well as a playwright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puro Arte|last=San Pablo Burns|first=Lucy Mae|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dogeaters]]'' talks about political and cultural issues within that time.

== Issues in the Filipino American Theater Community ==
When the first group of Filipinos joined the theater community they also received a lot of backlash. One of the most common instances are racial issues. One of the most popular plays that had a lot of Filipino actors, ''Miss Saigon,'' had the issue of casting a white actor for an Asian role (113).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puro Arte|last=San Pablo Burns|first=Lucy Mae|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this, it exposed the history of yellow face within the theater community. 

Another issue that was faced due to ''Miss Saigon'' was when it had its own production in the Philippines. [[JV Ejercito|J.V Ejercito]], the owner of the production of ''Miss Saigon'', became a member of the Philippine congress. J.V Ejercito’s background stirred up controversies since his father [[Joseph Estrada]] was still in power when the production was going on.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The public implied that the production gained it money not through profit but through politics and free enterprise.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puro Arte|last=San Pablo Burns|first=Lucy Mae|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the production of ''Miss Saigon'', the international work force for Filipinos was also rising. Filipinos were seen as Little Brown Fucking Machines (LBFM) my military men thus giving Filipinos the roles of prostitutes within plays.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because of ''Miss Saigon'', Filipinos were then seen as maids and domestic helpers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Puro Arte|last=San Pablo Burns|first=Lucy Mae|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Filipino American Productions in Universities ==
Pilipino Cultural Night (PCN) is an event mostly organized by students in which they express cultural aspects through theatrical mediums. It was established in 1972 to celebrate the Filipino American community at California State University.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lbpcnwebmaster.wixsite.com/lbpcn|title=Long Beach Pilipino Cultural Night|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; California State University had their first PCN with the theme: “Anyong Pilipino: Portrait of the Pilipino”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Around the 1980s, PCN incorporated folklore dance to theatrical narratives.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Day the Dancers Stayed: Performing the Filipino/American Diaspora|last=Gonzalves|first=Theodore S.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the University of Hawai’i, the Fil-Am club sponsored an event called Gabi ng Pilipino (Filipino Night).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It featured popular dance and musical presentations from late 1970’s to mid-1980’s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''''Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus''''' is a [[novel]] written by English author [[Mary Shelley]] (1797–1851) that tells the story of [[Victor Frankenstein]], a young scientist who creates a hideous, [[Sapience|sapient]] [[Frankenstein's monster|creature]] in an unorthodox scientific experiment. Shelley started writing the story when she was 18, and the first edition of the novel was published anonymously in London on 1 January 1818, when she was 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff writer |date=1 January 1818 |title=Books Published This Day |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/32751068 |newspaper=The Times |location=London, England |issue=10342 |page=4 |quote=This day is published, in 3 vols., price 16s. 6d., a Work of Imagination, to be entitled Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name first appeared on the second edition, published in 1823.

Shelley travelled through Europe in 1814, journeying along the river [[Rhine]] in Germany with a stop in [[Gernsheim]], which is {{convert|17|km}} away from [[Frankenstein Castle]], where, two centuries before, an [[alchemist]] was engaged in experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Hobbler, Dorthy and Thomas. ''The Monsters: Mary Shelley and the Curse of Frankenstein''. Back Bay Books; 20 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett, Martin. ''Mary Shelley''. Oxford University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seymour, Miranda. ''Mary Shelley''. Atlanta, GA: Grove Press, 2002. pg 110-111&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she travelled in the region of [[Geneva]] (Switzerland)—where much of the story takes place—and the topic of [[galvanism]] and [[occult]] ideas were themes of conversation among her companions, particularly her lover and future husband, [[Percy Shelley]]. Mary, Percy and [[Lord Byron]] decided to have a competition to see who could write the best [[Horror fiction|horror]] story. After thinking for days, Shelley dreamt about a scientist who created life and was horrified by what he had made; her dream later evolved into the novel's story.

''Frankenstein'' is infused with elements of the [[Gothic fiction|Gothic novel]] and the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement. At the same time, it is an early example of [[science fiction]]. [[Brian Aldiss]] has argued that it should be considered the first true science fiction story because, in contrast to previous stories with fantastical elements resembling those of later science fiction, the central character "makes a deliberate decision" and "turns to modern experiments in the laboratory" to achieve fantastic results.&lt;ref&gt;''The Detached Retina: Aspects of SF and Fantasy'' by Brian Aldiss (1995), [https://books.google.com/books?id=N1WWSRVeOC8C&amp;pg=PA78#v=onepage page 78].&lt;/ref&gt; It has had a considerable influence in literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of [[horror fiction|horror]] stories, films and plays.

Since the novel's publication, the name "Frankenstein" has often been used to refer to the monster itself. This usage is sometimes considered erroneous, but usage commentators regard it as well-established and acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen Evans, ''Comfortable Words'', New York: Random House, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Garner, ''A Dictionary of Modern American Usage'', New York, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of American English'', Merriam-Webster: 2002&lt;/ref&gt; In the novel, the monster is identified by words such as "creature", "monster", "demon", "wretch", "abortion", "fiend" and "it". Speaking to Victor Frankenstein, the monster says "I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel" (which ties to [[Lucifer]] in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', which the monster reads, and which relates to the disobedience of [[Prometheus]] in the book's subtitle).

==Summary==

''Frankenstein'' is written in the form of a [[frame story]] that starts with Captain Robert Walton writing letters to his sister. It takes place at an unspecified time in the 18th century, as the letters' dates are given as "17—". In the story following the letters by Walton, the readers find that Victor Frankenstein creates a monster that brings tragedy to his life.

===Captain Walton's introductory frame narrative===
The novel ''Frankenstein'' is written in [[Epistolary novel|epistolary form]], documenting a fictional correspondence between Captain Robert Walton and his sister, Margaret Walton Saville. Walton is a failed writer and captain who sets out to explore the [[North Pole]] and expand his scientific knowledge in hopes of achieving fame. During the voyage, the crew spots a dog sled driven by a gigantic figure. A few hours later, the crew rescues a nearly frozen and emaciated man named [[Victor Frankenstein]]. Frankenstein has been in pursuit of the gigantic man observed by Walton's crew. Frankenstein starts to recover from his exertion; he sees in Walton the same obsession that has destroyed him, and recounts a story of his life's miseries to Walton as a warning. The recounted story serves as the frame for Frankenstein's narrative.

===Victor Frankenstein's narrative===

Victor begins by telling of his childhood. Born in [[Naples]], Italy, into a wealthy [[Geneva]]n family, Victor and his brothers, Ernest and William, all three being sons of Alphonse Frankenstein by the former Caroline Beaufort, are encouraged to seek a greater understanding of the world through chemistry. As a young boy, Victor is obsessed with studying outdated theories that focus on simulating natural wonders. When Victor is five years old, his parents adopt [[Elizabeth Lavenza]], the orphaned daughter of an expropriated Italian nobleman, with whom Victor (allegedly) later falls in love. During this period, Victor's parents, Alphonse and Caroline, take in yet another orphan, Justine Moritz, who becomes William's nanny.

Weeks before he leaves for the [[University of Ingolstadt]] in Germany, his mother dies of [[scarlet fever]]; Victor buries himself in his experiments to deal with the grief. At the university, he excels at chemistry and other sciences, soon developing a secret technique to impart life to non-living matter. Eventually, he undertakes the creation of a humanoid, but due to the difficulty in replicating the minute parts of the human body, Victor makes the Creature tall, about {{convert|8|ft}} in height and proportionally large. Despite Victor selecting its features as beautiful, upon animation the creature is instead hideous, with watery white eyes and yellow skin that barely conceals the muscles and blood vessels underneath. Repulsed by his work, Victor flees when it awakens. While wandering the streets, he meets his childhood friend, Henry Clerval, and takes Henry back to his apartment, fearful of Henry's reaction if he sees the monster. However, the Creature has escaped.

Victor falls ill from the experience and is nursed back to health by Henry. After a four-month recovery, he returns home when he learns of the murder of his brother William. Upon arriving in Geneva, Victor sees the Creature near the crime scene and climbing a mountain, leading him to believe his creation is responsible. Justine Moritz, William's nanny, is convicted of the crime after William's locket, which had contained a miniature portrait of Caroline, is found in her pocket. Victor is helpless to stop her from being hanged, as he knows no one would believe his story.

Ravaged by grief and guilt, Victor retreats into the mountains. The Creature finds him and pleads for Victor to hear his tale.

=== The Creature's narrative ===
Intelligent and articulate, [[Frankenstein's monster|the Creature]] relates his first days of life, living alone in the wilderness and finding that people were afraid of and hated him due to his appearance, which led him to fear and hide from them. While living in an abandoned structure connected to a cottage, he grew fond of the poor family living there, and discreetly collected firewood for them. Secretly living among the family for months, the Creature learned to speak by listening to them and he taught himself to read after discovering a lost satchel of books in the woods. When he saw his reflection in a pool, he realized his physical appearance was hideous, and it terrified him as it terrifies normal humans. Nevertheless, he approached the family in hopes of becoming their friend. Initially he was able to befriend the blind father figure of the family, but the rest of them were frightened and they all fled their home, resulting in the Creature leaving, disappointed. He traveled to Victor's family estate using details from Victor's journal, murdered William, and framed Justine.

The Creature demands that Victor create a female companion like himself. He argues that as a living being, he has a right to happiness. The Creature promises that he and his mate will vanish into the South American wilderness, never to reappear, if Victor grants his request. Should Victor refuse his request, The Creature also threatens to kill Victor's remaining friends and loved ones and not stop until he completely ruins him.

Fearing for his family, Victor reluctantly agrees. The Creature says he will watch over Victor's progress.

=== Victor Frankenstein's narrative resumes ===
Clerval accompanies him to [[England]], but they separate at Victor's insistence at [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Scotland]]. Victor suspects that the Creature is following him. Working on the female creature on the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands]], he is plagued by premonitions of disaster, such as the female hating the Creature or becoming more evil than him, but more particularly the two creatures might lead to the breeding of a race that could plague mankind. He tears apart the unfinished female creature after he sees the Creature, who had indeed followed Victor, watching through a window. The Creature later confronts and tries to threaten Victor into working again, but Victor is convinced that the Creature is evil and that its mate would be evil as well, and the pair would threaten all humanity. Victor destroys his work and the Creature vows that he will "be with [him] on [his] wedding night". Victor interprets this as a threat upon his life, believing that the Creature will kill him after he finally becomes happy. When Victor lands in [[Ireland]], he is soon imprisoned for Clerval's murder, as the Creature had strangled Clerval to death and left the corpse to be found where his creator had arrived, causing the latter to suffer another mental breakdown in prison. After being acquitted, Victor returns home with his father, who has restored to Elizabeth some of her father's fortune.

In Geneva, Victor is about to marry Elizabeth and prepares to fight the Creature to the death, arming himself with pistols and a dagger. The night following their wedding, Victor asks Elizabeth to stay in her room while he looks for "the fiend". While Victor searches the house and grounds, the Creature strangles Elizabeth to death. From the window, Victor sees the Creature, who tauntingly points at Elizabeth's corpse; Victor tries to shoot him, but the Creature escapes. After Victor gets back to Geneva, Victor's father, weakened by age and by the death of his precious Elizabeth, dies a few days later. Seeking revenge, Victor pursues the Creature to the [[North Pole]], but collapses from exhaustion and [[hypothermia]] before he can find his quarry.

===Captain Walton's conclusion===
At the end of Victor's narrative, Captain Walton resumes the telling of the story, closing the frame around Victor's recounting. A few days after the Creature vanished, the ship becomes trapped in [[pack ice]] and multiple crewmen die in the cold, before the rest of Walton's crew insists on returning south once it is freed. Upon hearing the crew's pleas to their captain, Victor, angered, lectures them with a powerful speech: it is hardship, not comfort and easiness, that defines a glorious undertaking such as theirs; he urges them to be men, not cowards. The ship is freed and Walton, owing it to the will of his men, albeit regretfully, decides to return South. Victor, even though in very weak condition, states that he will go on by himself.

Victor dies shortly thereafter, telling Walton, with his last words, to seek "happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition". Walton discovers the Creature on his ship, mourning over Victor's body. The Creature tells Walton that Victor's death has not brought him peace; rather, his crimes have left him completely alone. The Creature vows to kill himself so that no others will ever know of his existence. Walton watches as the Creature drifts away on an ice raft that is soon "lost in darkness and distance", never to be seen again.

== Background ==
The author, [[Mary Shelley]], had a tragic life from the beginning. Shelley's mother, [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], died shortly after giving birth to her. Since Shelley did not know her mother it made her have a close attachment to her father. Shelley's father, [[William Godwin]], hired a nurse to care for her and her half sister but she left and her father ended up remarrying. Shelley's stepmother did not like the close bond Shelley had with her father. This caused Godwin to favor his other two daughters and sons. However, none of the neglect stopped Shelley from becoming the great female author she was.

Her father was a famous author himself and her education was of great importance. Shelley grew up surrounded by many different writers and persons of political importance because of her father. This inspired her authorship at an early age. Shelley met [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], who later became her husband, at the age of sixteen while he was visiting with her father at their home. Her father did not agree with their relationship so they fled to France along with her sister, Jane.  Later, she gave birth to their first child and soon after lost the child.

Both Mary and Percy went away with Jane to visit her lover [[Lord Byron]], in [[Geneva]] during the summer. Percy and Mary became good friends with Byron and used their time with him to discuss literature, politics, and science. One evening after being trapped in the house because of storms Byron suggested they all have a competition of writing the best ghost story. This is how Frankenstein was brought to life. Mary was eighteen years old when she wrote this novel. Shelley won the contest by her creation of the novel, Frankenstein. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/exhibition/frankenstein/exhibition1.html|title=Frankenstein: Penetrating the Secrets of Nature: The Birth of Frankenstein|website=www.nlm.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Badalamenti|first=Anthony|date=Fall 2006|title=Why did Mary Shelley Write Frankenstein|jstor=27512949|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|volume=45|pages=419–439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literary Influences ===
[[File:House of Lord Byron in Geneva.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:House%20of%20Lord%20Byron%20in%20Geneva.jpg|alt=Home of Lord Byron where Frankenstein was created|thumb|Lord Bryon's Home in Geneva.]]
Shelley was heavily influenced by both of her parents works. Her father was famous for [[Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]] and her mother famous for [[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]. Her father's novels also influenced her writing of ''Frankenstein''. These novels included [[Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams]], ''St. Leon,'' and ''Fleetwood''. All of these books were set in Switzerland, similar to the setting in Frankenstein. Some major themes of social affections and the renewal of life that appear in Shelley's novel stem from these works she had in her possession. Other literary influences that appear in ''Frankenstein'' are [[Pygmalion (play)]] and  [[Ovid]]  with the use of an individual lacking intelligence and those individuals identifying the problems with society. Ovid also inspires the use of [[Prometheus]] in Shelley's title.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pollin|first=Burton|date=Spring 1965|title=Philisophical and Literary Sources of Frankenstein|journal=Comparative Literature|volume=17|pages=97–108|jstor=1769997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her time spent with Lord Byron, Percy Shelley, her baby, and her sister Jane influenced her creation of Frankenstein as well. Percy and Bryon's discussion on life and death surrounded many scientific geniuses of the time. They discussed ideas from [[Charles Darwin]] and the experiments from [[Luigi Galvani]]. Mary listened intently to these conversations and the ideas of Darwin and Galvani were both present in her novel. The horrors of not being able to write a story for the contest and her hard life also influenced the themes within ''Frankenstein.'' The themes of loss , guilt, and the consequences of defying nature present in the novel all developed from Mary Shelley's own life. The loss of her mother, the relationship with her father, and the death of her first child created the monster and his separation from parental guidance. Guilt stemmed from her not feeling good enough for Percy because of the loss of their child.   &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|How I, then a young girl, came to think of, and to dilate upon, so very hideous an idea?|Mary Shelley&lt;ref&gt;"Preface", 1831 edition of ''Frankenstein''&lt;/ref&gt;}}During the rainy summer of 1816, the "[[Year Without a Summer]]", the world was locked in a long cold [[volcanic winter]] caused by the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Shelley]], aged 18, and her lover (and later husband) [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] visited [[Lord Byron]] at the [[Villa Diodati]] by [[Lake Geneva]] in Switzerland. The weather was consistently too cold and dreary that summer to enjoy the outdoor holiday activities they had planned, so the group retired indoors until dawn.

Sitting around a log fire at Byron's villa, the company amused themselves by reading German ghost stories translated into French from the book ''[[Fantasmagoriana]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Dr. John Polidori, "The Vampyre" 1819, The New Monthly Magazine and Universal Register; London: H. Colburn, 1814–1820. Vol. 1, No. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; then Byron proposed that they "each write a ghost story".&lt;ref&gt;paragraph 7, Introduction, Frankenstein 1831 edition&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to think of a story, young Mary became anxious: "''Have you thought of a story?'' I was asked each morning, and each morning I was forced to reply with a mortifying negative."&lt;ref&gt;paragraph 8, Introduction, Frankenstein 1831 edition&lt;/ref&gt; During one evening in the middle of summer, the discussions turned to the nature of the principle of life. "Perhaps a corpse would be re-animated", Mary noted, "[[galvanism]] had given token of such things".&lt;ref&gt;paragraph 10, Introduction, Frankenstein 1831 edition&lt;/ref&gt; It was after midnight before they retired, and unable to sleep, she became possessed by her imagination as she beheld the "grim terrors" of her "waking dream".&lt;ref&gt;Shelley, Mary. Paragraphs 11–13, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/42324/42324-h/42324-h.htm "Introduction" ''Frankenstein'' (1831 edition)] Gutenberg&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|I saw the pale student of unhallowed arts kneeling beside the thing he had put together. I saw the hideous phantasm of a man stretched out, and then, on the working of some powerful engine, show signs of life, and stir with an uneasy, half vital motion. Frightful must it be; for supremely frightful would be the effect of any human endeavour to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Spark, 157, from Mary Shelley's introduction to the 1831 edition of ''Frankenstein''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In September 2011, astronomer Donald Olson, after a visit to the Lake Geneva villa the previous year and inspecting data about the motion of the moon and stars, concluded that her "waking dream" took place "between 2 a.m. and 3 a.m." on 16 June 1816, several days after the initial idea by Lord Byron that they each write a ghost story.&lt;ref name="astro"&gt;Radford, Tim, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/26/frankenstein-hour-creation-identified-astronomers Frankenstein's hour of creation identified by astronomers]'', The Guardian, Sunday 25 September 2011 (retrieved 5 January 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

She began writing what she assumed would be a short story. With Percy Shelley's encouragement, she expanded the tale into a full-fledged novel.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, ''An Introduction'', 30–31; Sunstein, 124.&lt;/ref&gt; She later described that summer in Switzerland as the moment "when I first stepped out from childhood into life".&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley wrote the first four chapters in the weeks following the suicide of her half-sister Fanny.&lt;ref&gt;Hay, 103.&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of many personal tragedies that impacted Shelley's work. Shelley's first child died in infancy, and when she began composing ''Frankenstein'' in 1816, she was likely nursing her second child, who would also be dead at ''Frankenstein''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lepore|first=Jill|date=February 5, 2018|title=The Strange and Twisted Life of 'Frankenstein'|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/02/12/the-strange-and-twisted-life-of-frankenstein|journal=The New Yorker|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byron managed to write just a fragment based on the [[vampire]] legends he heard while travelling the [[Balkans]], and from this [[John Polidori]] created ''[[The Vampyre]]'' (1819), the progenitor of the romantic vampire literary genre. Thus two seminal horror tales originated from the conclave.

The group talked about [[Enlightenment (philosophy)|Enlightenment]] and [[Counter-Enlightenment]] ideas as well. Shelley believed the Enlightenment idea that society could progress and grow if political leaders used their powers responsibly; however, she also believed the Romantic ideal that misused power could destroy society (Bennett 36–42).&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Betty T. Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley: An Introduction. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelly wrote much of the book while residing in a lodging house in the centre of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Kennedy| first = Mave|title='A 200-year-old secret': plaque to mark Bath's hidden role in Frankenstein|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/26/a-200-year-old-secret-plaque-to-mark-baths-hidden-role-in-frankenstein|publisher=theguardian.com |date=26 February 2018|accessdate=13 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelley's manuscripts for the first three-volume edition in 1818 (written 1816–1817), as well as the [[fair copy]] for her publisher, are now housed in the [[Bodleian Library]] in [[Oxford]].

[[File:Editions of Frankenstein.jpg|thumb|A variety of different editions]]

The second edition of ''Frankenstein'' was published on 11 August 1823 in two volumes (by G. and W. B. Whittaker) following the success of the stage play ''Presumption; or, the Fate of Frankenstein'' by [[Richard Brinsley Peake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qykBJvG0iJQC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3#v=onepage|first= Mary |last=Wollstonecraft Shelley|authorlink=Mary Shelley|title= Frankenstein|publisher= Bedford Publishing |year=2000|page= 3|isbn= 9780312227623 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This edition credited Mary Shelley as the book's author on its title page.

On 31 October 1831, the first "popular" edition in one-volume appeared, published by [[Henry Colburn]] &amp; Richard Bentley.&lt;ref&gt;See forward to ''Barnes and Noble'' classic edition.&lt;/ref&gt; This edition was heavily revised by Mary Shelley, partially to make the story less radical. It included a lengthy new preface by the author, presenting a somewhat embellished version of the genesis of the story. This edition is the one most widely published and read now, although a few editions follow the 1818 text.&lt;ref&gt;The edition published by ''Forgotten Books'' is the original text, as is the "Ignatius Critical Edition". ''Vintage Books'' has an edition presenting both versions.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars prefer the original version, arguing that it preserves the spirit of Mary Shelley's vision (see Anne K. Mellor's "Choosing a Text of ''Frankenstein'' to Teach" in the [[W. W. Norton]] Critical edition).

In 2008, a new edition of the novel, titled ''The Original Frankenstein'', edited by Charles E. Robinson, was published. Robinson examined the original manuscript by Mary Shelley and noted the edits that Percy Bysshe Shelley made to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-original-frankenstein-by-mary-shelley-with-percy-shelley-ed-charles-e-robinson-1017483.html | title=The Original Frankenstein, By Mary Shelley with Percy Shelley ed Charles E Robinson | work=The Independent | author=James Grande | date=2008-11-25 | accessdate=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear}}

==Frankenstein and the Monster==

===The Creature===
{{Main|Frankenstein's monster}}
[[File:Punch Anti-Irish propaganda (1882) Irish Frankenstein.jpg|thumb|upright|An English editorial cartoonist conceives the Irish [[Fenian|Fenian movement]] as akin to Frankenstein's creature, in the wake of the [[Phoenix Park murders]] in an 1882 issue of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/frankenstein/escaping.html Frankenstein:Celluloid Monster] at the National Library of Medicine website of the (U.S.) National Institutes of Health&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Part of Frankenstein's rejection of his creation is the fact that he does not give it a name, which causes a lack of identity. Instead it is referred to by words such as "wretch", "monster", "creature", "demon", "devil", "fiend", and "it". When Frankenstein converses with the creature in Chapter 10, he addresses it as "vile insect", "abhorred monster", "fiend", "wretched devil", and "abhorred devil".

During a telling of ''Frankenstein'', Shelley referred to the creature as "[[Adam]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/ppo/currentprograms/frankenstein/exhibittext.pdf |title=Frankenstein: Penetrating the Secrets of Nature / Exhibit Text |publisher=[[National Library of Medicine]] and ALA Public Programs Office |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |accessdate=31 December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061204162542/http://www.ala.org/ala/ppo/currentprograms/frankenstein/exhibittext.pdf |archivedate=4 December 2006 |df=dmy }} from the traveling exhibition [http://www.ala.org/ala/ppo/currentprograms/frankenstein/frankensteinpenetrating.cfm Frankenstein: Penetrating the Secrets of Nature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109215920/http://www.ala.org/ala/ppo/currentprograms/frankenstein/frankensteinpenetrating.cfm |date=9 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2017}} Shelley was referring to the [[List of first men or women in mythology and religion|first man]] in the [[Garden of Eden]], as in her epigraph:

:Did I request thee, Maker, from my clay
:To mould Me man? Did I solicit thee
:From darkness to promote me?
::[[John Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (X. 743–5)

Although the creature would be described in later works as a composite of whole body parts grafted together from cadavers and [[reanimation (science fiction)|reanimated]] by the use of [[electricity]], this description is not consistent with Shelley's work; both the use of electricity and the cobbled-together image of Frankenstein's monster were more the result of [[James Whale]]'s popular 1931 [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|film adaptation of the story]], and other early motion-picture works based upon the creature. In Shelley's original work, Dr. Frankenstein discovers a previously unknown but elemental principle of life, and that insight allows him to develop a method to imbue vitality into inanimate matter, though the exact nature of the process is left largely ambiguous. After a great deal of hesitation in exercising this power, Frankenstein spends two years painstakingly constructing the creature's proportionally large body (one anatomical feature at a time, from raw materials supplied by "the dissecting room and the slaughter-house"), which he then brings to life using his unspecified process.

The creature has often been mistakenly called "Frankenstein". In 1908 one author said "It is strange to note how well-nigh universally the term "Frankenstein" is misused, even by intelligent people, as describing some hideous monster".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rBoOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA238 ''Author's Digest: The World's Great Stories in Brief''], by Rossiter Johnson, 1908&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edith Wharton]]'s ''[[The Reef (novel)|The Reef]]'' (1916) describes an unruly child as an "infant Frankenstein."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Reef (novel)|The Reef]]'', page 96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Lindsay (novelist)|David Lindsay]]'s "The Bridal Ornament", published in ''The Rover'', 12 June 1844, mentioned "the maker of poor Frankenstein." After the release of Whale's cinematic ''Frankenstein'', the public at large began speaking of the creature itself as "Frankenstein". This also occurs in Frankenstein films, including ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935) and several subsequent films, as well as in film titles such as ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''. Furthermore, the 1939 film ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]'' introduced an evil laboratory assistant, Ygor ([[Bela Lugosi]]), who never existed in the original narrative.

===Victor Frankenstein's name===
Mary Shelley maintained that she derived the name ''Frankenstein'' from a dream-vision. Despite her public claims of originality, however, a number of other sources have been suggested as Shelley's actual inspiration. The German name ''Frankenstein'' means "stone of the [[Franks]]", and it is associated with various places in Germany, including [[Frankenstein Castle]] (''Burg Frankenstein'') in [[Darmstadt]], [[Hesse]], and Frankenstein Castle in [[Frankenstein, Rhineland-Palatinate|Frankenstein]], a town in the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]]. There is also a castle called Frankenstein in [[Bad Salzungen]], Thuringia, and a municipality called [[Frankenstein, Saxony|Frankenstein]] in Saxony. Until 1945, [[Ząbkowice Śląskie]], now a city in [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]], [[Poland]], was mainly populated by [[Germans]] and named ''Frankenstein'' in German, and was the site of a [[:pl:Afera grabarzy z Frankenstein|scandal involving gravediggers]] in 1606, which has been suggested as an inspiration to the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historiamniejznanaizapomniana.wordpress.com/2016/01/24/afera-grabarzy-z-frankenstein/|title=Afera grabarzy z Frankenstein|first=Historia|last=zapomniana|date=24 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the name is borne by the aristocratic [[House of Franckenstein]] from [[Franconia]].

[[Radu Florescu]] argues that Mary and Percy Shelley visited Frankenstein Castle near Darmstadt in 1814 during their return to England from their elopement to Switzerland. It was at this castle that a notorious alchemist, [[Johann Conrad Dippel|Conrad Dippel]], had experimented with human bodies, and Florescu reasons that Mary suppressed mention of her visit in order to maintain her public claim of originality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Florescu|1996|pp=48–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A literary essay by A.&amp;nbsp;J. Day supports Florescu's position that Mary Shelley knew of and visited Frankenstein Castle before writing her debut novel.&lt;ref name="Day2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Day|first=A.J.|title=Fantasmagoriana (Tales of the Dead)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=szyuBymktB4C&amp;pg=PA150|year=2005|publisher=Fantasmagoriana Press|isbn=978-1-4116-5291-0|pages=149–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day includes details of an alleged description of the Frankenstein castle that exists in Mary Shelley's 'lost' journals. According to Jörg Heléne, the 'lost journals', as well as Florescu's claims, cannot be verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://darmundestat.wordpress.com/sonstiges/mary-shelleys-frankenstein-castle-frankenstein-and-the-alchemist-johann-conrad-dippel |title=Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, Castle Frankenstein and the alchemist Johann Conrad Dippel |last=Heléne |first=Jörg|date=12 September 2016 |website=Darmstadt |publisher= |access-date=2017-06-23 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A possible interpretation of the name Victor is derived from ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' by [[John Milton]], a great influence on Shelley (a quotation from ''Paradise Lost'' is on the opening page of ''Frankenstein'' and Shelley even has the monster himself read it).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.upenn.edu/Projects/knarf/Articles/wade.html Wade, Phillip. "Shelley and the Miltonic Element in Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein''."'' Milton and the Romantics'', 2 (December, 1976), 23–25.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|1952|pp=496–7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Milton frequently refers to God as "the Victor" in ''Paradise Lost'', and Shelley sees Victor as playing God by creating life. In addition, Shelley's portrayal of the monster owes much to the character of [[Satan]] in ''Paradise Lost''; indeed, the monster says, after reading the epic poem, that he empathizes with Satan's role in the story.

There are many similarities between Victor and Percy Shelley, Mary's husband. Victor was a pen name of Percy Shelley's, as in the collection of poetry he wrote with his sister Elizabeth, ''[[Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Sandy | first =Mark | title =Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire | work =[[The Literary Encyclopedia]]| publisher =The Literary Dictionary Company | date =20 September 2002 | url =http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=3010 | accessdate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is speculation that one of Mary Shelley's models for Victor Frankenstein was Percy, who at Eton had "experimented with electricity and magnetism as well as with gunpowder and numerous chemical reactions", and whose rooms at Oxford were filled with scientific equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822) | publisher =Department of English, [[Dickinson College]] | work=Romantic Natural History | url =http://www.dickinson.edu/~nicholsa/Romnat/pbshelley.htm | accessdate = 2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Percy Shelley was the first-born son of a wealthy country squire with strong political connections and a descendant of Sir [[Bysshe Shelley]], 1st Baronet of [[Castle Goring]], and Richard Fitzalan, 10th [[Earl of Arundel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Percy Shelley#Ancestry]]&lt;/ref&gt; Victor's family is one of the most distinguished of that republic and his ancestors were counselors and [[syndic]]s. Percy had a sister named Elizabeth; Victor had an adopted sister named Elizabeth.

On 22 February 1815, Mary Shelley gave birth to a baby two months prematurely, and the baby died two weeks later. Percy did not care about the condition of this premature infant and left with Claire, Mary's stepsister, for a lurid affair.&lt;ref&gt;"''Journal 6 December''—Very Unwell. Shelley &amp; Clary walk out, as usual, to heaps of places ... A letter from Hookham to say that Harriet has been brought to bed of a son and heir. Shelley writes a number of circular letters on this event, which ought to be ushered in with ringing of bells, etc., for it is the son of his ''wife''." Quoted in Spark, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; When Victor saw the creature come to life he fled the apartment, though the newborn creature approached him, as a child would a parent. The question of Victor's responsibility to the creature is one of the main themes of the book.

===Modern Prometheus===
''The Modern Prometheus'' is the novel's subtitle (though some modern editions now drop the subtitle, mentioning it only in an introduction).&lt;ref&gt;For example, the Longman study edition published in India in 2007 by Pearson Education&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prometheus]], in later versions of Greek mythology, was the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who created mankind at the behest of [[Zeus]]. He made a being in the image of the gods that could have a spirit breathed into it.&lt;ref&gt;In the best-known versions of the Prometheus story, by Hesiod and Aeschylus, Prometheus merely brings fire to mankind. But in other versions, such as several of Aesop's fables (See in particular Fable 516), Sappho (Fragment 207), and Ovid's Metamorphoses, Prometheus is the actual creator of humanity.&lt;/ref&gt; Prometheus taught man to hunt, read, and heal their sick, but after he tricked Zeus into accepting poor-quality offerings from humans, Zeus kept fire from mankind. Prometheus, being the creator, took back the fire from Zeus to give to man. When Zeus discovered this, he sentenced Prometheus to be eternally punished by fixing him to a rock of [[Caucasus]], where each day an eagle would peck out his liver, only for the liver to regrow the next day because of his immortality as a god. He was intended to suffer alone for eternity, but eventually [[Heracles]] ([[Hercules]]) released him.

Prometheus was also a myth told in Latin, but was a very different story. In this version Prometheus makes man from clay and water, again a very relevant theme to ''Frankenstein'', as Victor rebels against the laws of nature (how life is naturally made) and as a result is punished by his creation.

[[File:Frankenstein1910.jpg|thumb|In 1910, [[Edison Studios]] released the [[Frankenstein (1910 film)|first motion-picture adaptation]] of Shelley's story.]]

The Titan in the Greek mythology of Prometheus parallels Victor Frankenstein. Victor's work by creating man by new means reflects the same innovative work of the Titan in creating humans.

Some have argued that Mary Shelley saw Prometheus not as a hero but rather as something of a devil, and blamed him for bringing fire to man and thereby seducing the human race to the vice of eating meat (fire brought cooking which brought hunting and killing).&lt;ref&gt;(Leonard Wolf, p. 20).&lt;/ref&gt;

Byron was particularly attached to the play ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' by [[Aeschylus]], and Percy Shelley would soon write his own ''[[Prometheus Unbound (Shelley)|Prometheus Unbound]]'' (1820). The term "Modern Prometheus" was actually coined by [[Immanuel Kant]] in reference to [[Benjamin Franklin]] and his experiments with electricity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://royalsociety.org/exhibitions/2006/benjamin-franklin/ RoyalSoc.ac.uk] "Benjamin Franklin in London." The Royal Society. Retrieved 8 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shelley's sources==
Shelley incorporated a number of different sources into her work, one of which was the [[Prometheus|Promethean]] myth from [[Ovid]]. The influence of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'', are also clearly evident within the novel. Mary is likely to have acquired some ideas for Frankenstein's character from [[Humphry Davy]]'s book ''Elements of Chemical Philosophy'', in which he had written that "science has ... bestowed upon man powers which may be called creative; which have enabled him to change and modify the beings around him ...". References to the [[French Revolution]] run through the novel; a possible source may lie in {{ill|François-Félix Nogaret|fr}}'s ''Le Miroir des événemens actuels, ou la Belle au plus offrant'' (1790): a political parable about scientific progress featuring an inventor named Frankésteïn who creates a life-sized automaton.&lt;ref&gt;Douthwaite, "The Frankenstein of the French Revolution" chapter 2 of The Frankenstein of 1790 and other Lost Chapters from Revolutionary France ([http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/F/bo13265096.html Frankenstein of 1790 and other Lost Chapters from Revolutionary France], 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Percy Bysshe Shelley's 1816 poem "[[Mutability (poem)|Mutability]]" is also quoted and its theme of the role of the subconscious is discussed in prose. The Creature also quotes a passage of the poem. His name has never appeared as the author of the poem although other poets are cited by name in the novel, implying that Mary wrote the poem and developed the psychological ideas. Another potential reason is to conceal his contributions to the novel.

Within the past thirty years or so, many writers and historians have attempted to associate several then popular natural philosophers (now called physical scientists) with Shelley's work on account of several notable similarities. Two of the most notable natural philosophers among Shelley's contemporaries were [[Giovanni Aldini]], who made many public attempts at human reanimation through bio-electric Galvanism in London&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruston |first1=Sharon |title=The Science of Life and Death in Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'' |journal=[[The Public Domain Review]] |date=25 November 2015 |url=http://publicdomainreview.org/2015/11/25/the-science-of-life-and-death-in-mary-shelleys-frankenstein/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Konrad Dippel]], who was supposed to have developed chemical means to extend the life span of humans. While Shelley was obviously aware of both these men and their activities, she makes no mention of or reference to them or their experiments in any of her published or released notes.

== Reception ==
[[File:Frontispiece to Frankenstein 1831.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration by [[Theodor von Holst]] from the frontispiece of the 1831 edition&lt;ref&gt;This illustration is reprinted in the frontispiece to the [https://www.amazon.com/dp/098092104X 2008 edition of ''Frankenstein'']&lt;/ref&gt;]]

''Frankenstein'' has been both well received and disregarded since its anonymous publication in 1818. Critical reviews of that time demonstrate these two views, along with confused speculation as to the identity of the author. The ''[[La Belle Assemblée|Belle Assemblée]]'' described the novel as "very bold fiction" (139). The ''Quarterly Review'' stated that "the author has the power of both conception and language" (185). [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], writing in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine]]'', congratulated "the author's original genius and happy power of expression" (620), although he is less convinced about the way in which the monster gains knowledge about the world and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crossref-it.info/textguide/Frankenstein/7/400 |title=Crossref-it.info |publisher=Crossref-it.info |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Edinburgh Magazine'' and ''Literary Miscellany'' hoped to see "more productions from this author" (253). On the other hand, the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' described it "a tissue of horrible and disgusting absurdity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review of ''Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus''|journal=The Quarterly Review|date=January 1818|volume=18|pages=379–385|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.32044092624956;view=1up;seq=389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In two other reviews where the author is known as the daughter of William Godwin, the criticism of the novel makes reference to the feminine nature of Mary Shelley. The ''[[British Critic]]'' attacks the novel's flaws as the fault of the author: "The writer of it is, we understand, a female; this is an aggravation of that which is the prevailing fault of the novel; but if our authoress can forget the gentleness of her sex, it is no reason why we should; and we shall therefore dismiss the novel without further comment" (438). ''The Literary Panorama and National Register'' attacks the novel as a "feeble imitation of Mr. Godwin's novels" produced by the "daughter of a celebrated living novelist" (414). Despite the reviews, ''Frankenstein'' achieved an almost immediate popular success. It became widely known especially through melodramatic theatrical adaptations—Mary Shelley saw a production of ''Presumption; or The Fate of Frankenstein'', a play by [[Richard Brinsley Peake]], in 1823. A [[French translation]] appeared as early as 1821 (''Frankenstein: ou le Prométhée Moderne'', translated by Jules Saladin).

Critical reception of ''Frankenstein'' has been largely positive since the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/nineteenth-century-criticism/frankenstein-modern-prometheus-mary-wollstonecraft |title=Enotes.com |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major critics such as M. A. Goldberg and [[Harold Bloom]] have praised the "aesthetic and moral" relevance of the novel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.octc.kctcs.edu/crunyon/CE/Frankenstein/Bloom/4-7_BloomIntro.htm |title=KCTCS.edu |publisher=Octc.kctcs.edu |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are also critics such as [[Germaine Greer]], who criticized the novel as terrible due to technical and narrative defects (such as it featuring three narrators that speak in the same way).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/apr/09/gender.books | title=Yes, Frankenstein really was written by Mary Shelley.

Lipking. Frankenstein the True Story; or [[Rousseau]] Judges Jean-Jacques. (Published in the [[W. W.

Retrieved 27 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Film director [[Guillermo del Toro]] describes ''Frankenstein'' as "the quintessential teenage book", adding "You don't belong. You were brought to this world by people that don't care for you and you are thrown into a world of pain and suffering, and tears and hunger. It's an amazing book written by a teenage girl. It's mind-blowing."&lt;ref name="BBC 2018"/&gt; Professor of philosophy [[Patricia MacCormack]] says the creature, brought to life by Victor Frankenstein, addresses the most fundamental human questions: "It's the idea of asking your maker what your purpose is.

==History==
Formed in early 1935 by artists including [[Augusta Savage]], [[Charles Alston]] and [[Elba Lightfoot]], the Harlem Artists Guild (HAG) had headquarters on 136th Street, New York.

'''''Hollywood 7''''' (known as '''''S Club 7 in Hollywood''''' in the U.S.) was the third series in the [[BBC]] [[television series]] starring British pop group [[S Club|S Club 7]] and the second [[television series]] shot in [[California]]. The programme was shown every week on CBBC from 27 September 2001 and 20 December 2001&lt;ref name="airdate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://catalogue.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/HOLLYWOOD+7 | title=BBC Programme Catalogue - Hollywood 7 | accessdate=21 October 2007 | publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and starred all seven members of the band as fictionalized versions of themselves. The series also featured former ''[[Brady Bunch]]'' actor [[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]] as Dean Strickland, S Club 7's manager.

Following the pattern of the previous series of the show, the show was renamed ''S Club 7 in Hollywood'' for American audiences. It aired on the renamed [[ABC Family]] network from 29 September 2001 to 26 January 2002.&lt;ref name="USairdate"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://epguides.com/SClub7/ | title=L.A. 7 (A Titles &amp; Air Dates Guide) | accessdate=20 October 2007 | publisher=EpGuides.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main cast==
* [[Tina Barrett]] as Tina
* [[Paul Cattermole]] as Paul
* [[Jon Lee (singer)|Jon Lee]] as Jon
* [[Bradley McIntosh]] as Bradley
* [[Jo O'Meara]] as Jo
* [[Hannah Spearritt]] as Hannah
* [[Rachel Stevens]] as Rachel
* [[Barry Williams (actor)|Barry Williams]] as Dean Strickland

==Plot==
In the first episode of the series, the group decide to give themselves 24 hours to get themselves a new manager. The group come across Dean Strickland and he adopts the seven as their new manager. Shortly into the series, the group find themselves without a record deal and so they have to search for a deal, or else they'll disband. Luckily, the group find a record company willing to sign them. Unlike ''[[Miami 7]]'' and ''[[L.A. 7]]'', which portrays the S Club 7 as struggling just to make known of their existence, ''Hollywood 7'' portrays the group's experiencing what they've been hoping for since they came to [[United States of America|the States]]: having an agent, getting a record deal, becoming publicized, etc. They film their first music video, become a support act for a Latin heart-throb, and even have their first concert. At the end of the series, the group have to move back to England to record their album and start internationally promoting S Club 7, just as they're starting to become fully assimilated into American life.

The series also saw, mirroring real life, a relationship between [[Hannah Spearritt|Hannah]] and [[Paul Cattermole|Paul]] develop.&lt;ref name=love&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/music/newsid_1608000/1608993.stm | title=S Club 7 pair admit secret love | accessdate=21 October 2007 | date=19 October 2001 | publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fifth episode of the series, they share a kiss which sends shock waves throughout the band.

'''Kalaga''' ({{lang-my|ကန့်လန့်ကာ}}) is a heavily [[embroidered]] [[appliqué]] [[tapestry]] made of silk, flannel, felt, wool and lace against a background made of [[cotton]] or [[velvet]] indigenous to [[Burma]] (Myanmar).&lt;ref name="mukharji"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mukharji|first=T. N.|title=Art-manufactures of India|publisher=Superintendent of Government Printing, India|year=1888|pages=387–388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''kalaga'', which means "curtain," comes from the [[Burmese language]], although Burmese refer to such tapestries as ''shwe gyi do'' ({{my|ရွှေချည်ထိုး}}; lit. "gold thread embroidery").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niu.edu/burma/publications/jbs/vol16.1/index.shtml|title=Journal of Burma Studies - Volume 16.1|work=Northern Illinois University|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tapestries use a sewing technique called ''shwe gyi'' ({{my|ရွှေချည်}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraser-Lu|first=Sylvia|title=Burmese Crafts: Past and Present|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1994|pages=265|isbn=9780195886085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This artform emerged during the [[Konbaung dynasty]] in the mid-19th century and reached its zenith during the reign of [[Mindon Min]], when velvet became fashionable at the royal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Falconer|first=John|author2=Luca Invernizzi|title=Burmese Design and Architecture|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2000|pages=194–195|isbn=9789625938820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a typical tapestry, padded figures are cut from various types of cloth and sewn onto a background, usually red or black cloth to form an elaborate scene, traditionally from Burmese classical plays (e.g. [[Ramayana]], [[Jataka]]).&lt;ref name="mukharji"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leslie|first=Catherine Amoroso|title=Needlework Through History|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|pages=121|isbn=9780313335488}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="st"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.siamtraders.com/html/burma/kalaga.html|title=More information about Burmese Kalagas|year=2001|work=SiamTraders.com|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are sewn using a combination of metallic and plain threads and adorned with sequins, beads and glass stones.&lt;ref name="st"/&gt;

'''''Landscape with a Castle''''' is a painting by [[Rembrandt]], now in the [[Louvre]] in Paris. Art historians have variously dated it to 1652 (Rein van Eysinga), 1654 (Frederik Schmidt-Degener), early 1640 ([[Abraham Bredius]] and Horst Gerson), 1648 (Kurt Bauch), 1640-1642 (Jacques Foucart), c.1640 (Christian Tümpel) and 1643-1646 (Leonard J. Slatkes).

It is first recorded in the 1692 inventory of Geertruyt Brasser in [[Delft]] as "a castle by Rembrandt" - she was the widow of Johan van der Chys. It was later recorded in the collection of [[Jan Pieter van Suchtelen]], a Russian general from the Netherlands. In 1859 van Suchtelen's heirs sold it to [[Pavel Stroganov]] in [[St-Petersburg]]. On his death in 1911 Stroganov left it and the rest of his art collection to Vladimir and Aleksandra Shcherbatov, the children of his brother's daughter. Vladimir and Aleksandra were murdered by the Bolsheviks in 1920, three years after their artworks had been seized by the state. 

By 1925 at the latest the work had been moved to the [[Hermitage Museum]], but in 1932 it was secretly sold off by the USSR, probably via the art dealer [[Wildenstein and Company]]. In 1933 it was probably sold to the Parisian collector [[Étienne Nicolas]], in whose collection it definitively appeared in 1935. In 1942 Nicolas sold it and ''Portrait of Titus van Rijn'' to [[Adolf Hitler]] via the Berlin-based art dealer Karl Haberstock for 60 million francs - Hitler intended it for his [[Führermuseum]] in [[Linz]]. After the war's end it was returned to Nicolas via the Central Collecting Point and in 1948 he donated it to the Louvre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">'''Laufás-Edda''' (''Edda Magnúsar Ólafssonar'') is a famous 17th century redaction of the [[Snorra Edda]], which survives in numerous [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] [[manuscript]]s. 

Laufás Edda  was compiled by the Icelandic priest and poet [[Magnús Ólafsson]] (c.1573–1636) on the request of the Icelandic scholar and antiquarian [[Arngrímur Jónsson]]. Magnús began his work at [[Auðkúla]] in 1607 after he had been dismissed from his office as parish minister, and completed his new redaction during the winter of 1608-09. Magnús would later serve as the priest at Laufás parish in Northern Iceland and as a consequence his version of the Edda was falsely referred to as the Laufás Edda.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/dbl/12/0391.html ''Magnús Ólafsson'' (Dansk biografisk Lexikon / XII. Bind)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of his efforts was to make a systematic and encyclopedic version of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s [[Prose Edda]]. Laufás Edda is a rearranged redaction of the Snorra Edda. The myths in ''[[Gylfaginning]]'' are presented as a series of examples (apologi or dæmisögur) and the [[kenning]]s of ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' are organized alphabetically. The last part, ''[[Háttatal]]'', was not included.

Due to its popularity, the Laufás redaction later became the basis for the first printed Edition of the Snorra Edda, [[Peder Hansen Resen]]'s [[Edda Islandorum]]. Resen's edition was accompanied by a [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Latin]] translation. The Laufás Edda, especially through Resen's edition, became a convenient and popular work of reference for poets and antiquarians, serving as an encyclopedia for researching both myth and poetic language.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Clunies Ross]] and Lars Lönnroth, ''The Norse Muse: Report from an International Research Project''  (''Alvíssmál 9. 1999) [http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~alvismal/9muse.pdf 3–28] (pdf), here pp.&amp;nbsp;8–11.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4564">'''''Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution (Surrealism in the service of the revolution)''''' was a periodical issued by the [[Surrealist]] Group in Paris between 1930 and 1933.  It was the successor of ''[[La Révolution surréaliste]]'' (published 1924–29) and preceded the primarily surrealist publication ''[[Minotaure]]'' (1933 to 1939).

After the writing of his ''Second Manifesto of Surrealism'' (1929), which announced the expulsions of several prior surrealists due to theoretical differences, [[André Breton]] and his supporters developed a new, more politically charged publication.  The first issue of ''Le Surréalisme au service de la révolution'' was published in June 1930, and was followed by five more issues through 1933.  Contributors included [[André Breton]], [[Paul Éluard]], [[René Crevel]], [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[René Char]], [[Benjamin Péret]], [[Louis Aragon]], and [[Luis Buñuel]], among others.

==Selected issues==
'''Issue 1''' features writings by Breton, Éluard, Crevel, Tzara, Dalí, Char, Péret, and Aragon, and others. Illustrations include stills from Buñuel's film ''L'Âge d'or'', paintings by Dalí, and a drawing of the Russian poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] with a skeleton.

'''Issue 2''' features writings by Breton, Éluard, Crevel, Char, Péret, [[Marcel Duchamp]], Aragon, and [[Georges Sadoul]], and others. Illustrations include paintings by Dalí and [[Yves Tanguy]], and a photograph by [[Man Ray]]. The issue opens with an ad for Breton's First and Second ''Manifeste du Surrealisme'', and ads for two Paris art galleries.

'''Issue 3''' features writings by Breton, Éluard, Char, Tanguy, [[Max Ernst]], Pierre Unik, Crevel, and Aragon, and others. Illustrations include photographs of surrealist objects by Breton, [[Gala Éluard]], [[Valentine Hugo]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], and Dalí. The issue opens with an ad for the books ''L'Immaculee conception'' by Breton &amp; Eluard, ''La Peinture au defi'' by Aragon, and ''La Femme Visible'' by Dalí.

'''Issue 4''' features writings by Breton, Éluard, Char, Tzara, Dalí, Pierre Unik, Crevel, and Aragon, and others. Illustrations include a collage by Ernst, and paintings by Tanguy and Dalí. The issue opens with an ad for several books by Dalí.

'''Issue 5''' features writings by Breton, Éluard, Duchamp, Dalí, Pierre Unik, [[Paul Nouge]], and Aragon, and others. Illustrations include works by Duchamp, Dalí, Hugo, Ernst, and Man Ray. The issue opens with ads for numerous surrealist books by Péret, Tzara, Breton, Dalí, and Crevel, as well as publications by Achim D'Arnim and [[Lautreamont]]. There is also promotion of a major exhibit of surrealist art.

'''Issue 6''' features writings by Breton, Buñuel, Char, Tzara, and Péret, and others. [[André Thirion]] introduced translated excerpts from [[Lenin]]'s ''[[Philosophical Notebooks]]'' on [[Hegel]].&lt;ref name="Black2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Black|title=The Philosophical Roots of Anti-Capitalism: Essays on History, Culture, and Dialectical Thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TS1nAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46|year=2013|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=978-0-7391-7396-1|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illustrations include works by Giacometti, [[René Magritte]], Ernst, Breton, Hugo, Dalí, and Tanguy.

[[Vítězslav Novák]]'s '''Májová [[symphony|symfonie]], Op. 73''' (''May Symphony''), also known as '''Jarní symfonie''' (''Spring Symphony''), was composed in 1943, during the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia]]. It is a strongly patriotic [[choral symphony]] based in [[Karel Hynek Mácha|Karel H. Mácha]]'s 1836 poem [[Máj|May]], Novák's second contribution to the genre after his 1934 [[Autumn Symphony]]. Dedicated to [[Iosif Stalin]] as the liberator of Czechoslovakia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguepost.com/night-and-day/stage/6241-may-in-november.html May in November.] [[The Prague Post]], 03/11/10&lt;/ref&gt; the symphony was premiered in [[Prague]] on 5 December 1945,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klassika.info/Komponisten/Novak/Chorwerk/073/index.html Work profile] in klassika.info&lt;/ref&gt; seven months after the [[End of World War II in Europe|German defeat]].

==Structure==

The composition consists of three movements:&lt;ref&gt;[http://program.rozhlas.cz/digital/2012-09-18 18/09/12 schedule] of [[Czech Radio]]'s [[ČRo D-Dur]]&lt;/ref&gt;

#''Andante sostenuto''

'''''Mimir''''' is an outdoor 1980 bronze and concrete sculpture by [[Keith Jellum]], located in northwest [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]]. The sculpture was commissioned by the Portland Development Commission and Tom Walsh of Tom Walsh Construction, and is part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the [[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]].

==Description and history==
[[File:Oden vid Mims lik.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The sculpture is based on [[Mímir]] of [[Norse mythology]]. Pictured is a 19th-century depiction of [[Odin]] discovering Mímir's beheaded body.]]

''Mimir'' is an {{Convert|8|ft|adj=on}} bronze and concrete sculpture designed by Portland artist Keith Jellum, whose other works in the city include ''[[Electronic Poet]]'' (1984) and ''[[Transcendence (Jellum)|Transcendence]]'', a fish sculpture above Southpark Seafood  at Southwest Salmon Street and Ninth Avenue.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anderson|first1=Jennifer|title=Stumptown Stumper|url=http://portlandtribune.com/component/content/article?id=92227|accessdate=September 27, 2014|work=[[Portland Tribune]]|publisher=[[Pamplin Media Group]]|date=September 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mimir'' is based on the [[Mímir|figure of the same name]] in [[Norse mythology]], renowned for his knowledge and wisdom, and who is beheaded during the [[Æsir–Vanir War]]. Afterward, the god [[Odin]] carries around Mímir's head, which serves as an oracle and recites secret knowledge and counsel to him.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;&lt;ref name=PAA&gt;{{cite web|title=Mimir|url=http://www.publicartarchive.org/work/mimir|publisher=Public Art Archive|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Anderson of the ''[[Portland Tribune]]'' said the sculpture is a "combination of Norse mythology, gibberish, fish and space creature".&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; In 2007, Jellum recalled of its origin: "I'm not sure where [the image] came from. It's just at the time I was doing a whole lot of drawings, and it just popped out and sort of appealed to me. It's part fish, part space creature."&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

''Mimir'' was installed at Northwest 27th Avenue between Northwest Upshur and Thurman Streets in 1980, after being commissioned by the Portland Development Commission and Tom Walsh of Tom Walsh Construction.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; The [[Abstract art|abstract]] sculpture measures approximately {{Convert|24|in|cm}} x {{Convert|15|in|cm}} x {{Convert|13|in|cm}}, which rests on a concrete and stone base that measures {{Convert|7|ft|m}} x {{Convert|30|in|cm}} x {{Convert|30|in|cm}}.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|title=Mimir, (sculpture).|url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!323725~!0#focus|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Smithsonian Institution]] described the work as follows: "Decorative obelisk with a mask mounted at the top. The mask has a cone-like nose and tusks. It wears a layered breastplate with shoulder pads."&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; The base includes a plaque with no legible text. Anderson described the plaque as "a few lines of illegible chicken scratch as if it's an alien artifact that landed in the middle of the city."&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; Jellum described the hieroglyphic inscription as a "play upon plaques", explaining: "You see all these plaques around and they give all this 'important' information. I thought it was just irrelevant to the piece. I like the idea of putting something up there that didn't have any information on it."&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

The sculpture's condition was deemed "treatment needed" by Smithsonian's "[[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]]" program in October 1993.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; It is part of the City of Portland and Multnomah County Public Art Collection courtesy of the [[Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council]].&lt;ref name=CN&gt;{{cite web|title=Mimir, 1980|url=http://culturenow.org/entry&amp;permalink=06318|publisher=cultureNOW|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Anderson of the ''Portland Tribune'' contributor called the sculpture a "curiosity" and "whimsical", and said the plaque adds to its mystique.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt;

[[File:Cemetery Montparnasse for Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|[[Montparnasse cemetery]] and [[Tour Montparnasse]].]]
'''Montparnasse''' ({{IPA-fr|mɔ̃paʁnas}})(&lt;small&gt;French&lt;/small&gt; {{Audio-IPA|Musée du Montparnasse.ogg|}}) is an area of Paris, France, on the [[Rive Gauche|left bank]] of the river [[Seine]], centred at the crossroads of the [[Boulevard du Montparnasse]] and the Rue de Rennes, between the Rue de Rennes and boulevard Raspail. Montparnasse has been part of Paris {{citation needed span|since 1669|date=November 2017}} .

The area also gives its name to:

* [[Gare Montparnasse]]: trains to [[Brittany]], [[TGV]] to [[Rennes]], [[Tours]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Le Mans]]; rebuilt as a modern TGV station;
* The large [[Montparnasse - Bienvenüe (Paris Métro)|Montparnasse – Bienvenüe]] [[Paris Métro|métro]] station;
* [[Cimetière du Montparnasse]]: the Montparnasse Cemetery, where [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Man Ray]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Serge Gainsbourg]] or [[Susan Sontag]] are buried among other celebrities;
* [[Tour Montparnasse]], a lone skyscraper.

The [[Pasteur Institute]] is located in the area. Beneath the ground are tunnels of the [[Catacombs of Paris]].

Students in the 17th century who came to recite poetry in the hilly neighbourhood nicknamed it after "[[Mount Parnassus]]", home to the nine [[Muses]] of arts and sciences in [[Greek mythology]].

The hill was levelled to construct the Boulevard Montparnasse in the 18th century. During the [[French Revolution]] many dance halls and [[cabaret]]s opened their doors.

The area is also known for cafés and bars, such as the [[Brittany|Breton]] restaurants specialising in [[crêpe]]s (thin pancakes) located a few blocks from the Gare Montparnasse.

==Artistic hub==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Le Dôme - Paris.JPG|thumb|left|[[Le Dôme Café]]]]
In the 18th century, students recited poems at the foot of an artificial hillock of rock rubble from the catacombs, a near-by network of underground galleries. Ironically, they decided to baptize this mound "Mount Parnassus", named after the one celebrated by Greek poets. In early 20th century, many Bretons driven out of their region by poverty arrived by train at Montparnasse station, the heart of the district, and settled near-by.&lt;ref name=ParisDigest&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.parisdigest.com/paris/montparnasse.htm |title=Montparnasse |author= |year=2018 |publisher=Paris Digest |accessdate=2018-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Montparnasse became famous in the 1920s, referred to as ''les Années Folles'' (the Crazy Years), and the 1930s as the heart of intellectual and artistic life in Paris. From 1910 to the start of [[World War II]], Paris' artistic circles migrated to Montparnasse as alternative to the [[Montmartre]] district which had been the intellectual breeding ground for the previous generation of artists. The Paris of [[Émile Zola|Zola]], [[Manet]], [[Anatole France|France]], [[Degas]], [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]], a group that had assembled more on the basis of status affinity than actual artistic tastes, indulging in the refinements of [[Dandyism]], was at the opposite end of the economic, social, and political spectrum from the gritty, tough-talking, die-hard, emigrant artists that peopled Montparnasse.

Virtually penniless painters, sculptors, writers, poets and composers came from around the world to thrive in the creative atmosphere and for the cheap rent at artist communes such as [[La Ruche]]. Living without running water, in damp, unheated "studios", seldom free of rats, many sold their works for a few francs just to buy food. [[Jean Cocteau]] once said that poverty was a luxury in Montparnasse. First promoted by art dealers such as [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], today works by those artists sell for millions of euros.

In post-[[World War I]] Paris, Montparnasse was a euphoric meeting ground for the artistic world. [[Fernand Léger]] wrote of that period:  "man…relaxes and recaptures his taste for life, his frenzy to dance, to ''spend money''…an explosion of ''life-force fills the world''." &lt;ref&gt;Woodhead, Lindy, "War Paint: Madame Rubenstein and Miss Elizabeth Arden, Their Lives, Their Times, Their Rivalry," Wiley, 2004, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; They came to Montparnasse from all over the globe, from Europe, including Russia, [[Hungary]] and [[Ukraine]], from the United States, Canada, [[Mexico]], [[Central America|Central]] and South America, and from as far away as Japan. [[Manuel Ortiz de Zárate]], [[Camilo Mori]] and others made their way from [[Chile]] where the profound innovations in art spawned the formation of the [[Grupo Montparnasse]] in [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]]. A few of the other artists who gathered in Montparnasse were [[Jacob Macznik]]&lt;ref&gt;Montparnasse Déporté: Artisti Europei de Parigi al Lager; published by Elede, 2007, under the auspices of the Musée du Montparnasse, the City of Turin, and the Region of Piemonte (Italy)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Undzere Farpainikte Kinstler, Hersh Fenster, Imprimerie Abècé, Paris, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Ossip Zadkine]], [[Julio González (sculptor)|Julio Gonzalez]], [[Moise Kisling]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Erik Satie]], [[Marios Varvoglis]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Nina Hamnett]], [[Jean Rhys]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Max Jacob]], [[Blaise Cendrars]], [[Chaim Soutine]], [[James Joyce]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Michel Kikoine]], [[Pinchus Kremegne]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Ford Madox Ford]], [[Toño Salazar]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[Max Ernst]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Suzanne Duchamp]]-Crotti, [[Henri Rousseau]], [[Constantin Brâncuși]], [[Paul Fort]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[Federico Cantú]], [[Angel Zarraga]], [[Marie Vorobieff|Marevna]], [[Tsuguharu Foujita]], [[Marie Vassilieff]], [[Léon-Paul Fargue]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[René Iché]], [[André Breton]], [[Alfonso Reyes]], [[Pascin]], [[Nils Dardel]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Emil Cioran]], [[Reginald Gray (artist)|Reginald Gray]], [[Endre Ady]] poet and journalist, [[Joan Miró]], [[Hilaire Hiler]] and, in his declining years, [[Edgar Degas]].

[[File:La Rotonde-2.jpg|thumb|left|La Rotonde at night 2007]]

Montparnasse was a community where creativity was embraced with all its oddities, each new arrival welcomed unreservedly by its existing members. When [[Tsuguharu Foujita]] arrived from Japan in 1913 not knowing a soul, he met Soutine, Modigliani, Pascin and Léger virtually the same night and within a week became friends with Juan Gris, Picasso and Matisse. In 1914, when the English painter [[Nina Hamnett]] arrived in Montparnasse, on her first evening the smiling man at the next table at ''La Rotonde'' graciously introduced himself as "Modigliani, painter and Jew". They became good friends, Hamnett later recounting how she once borrowed a jersey and corduroy trousers from Modigliani, then went to ''La Rotonde'' and danced in the street all night.

Between 1921 and 1924, the number of Americans in Paris swelled from 6,000 to 30,000. While most of the artistic community gathered here were struggling to eke out an existence, well-heeled American socialites such as [[Peggy Guggenheim]], and [[Edith Wharton]] from New York City, [[Harry Crosby]] from [[Boston]] and [[Beatrice Wood]] from San Francisco were caught in the fever of creativity. [[Robert McAlmon]], and [[Maria Jolas|Maria]] and [[Eugene Jolas]] came to Paris and published their literary magazine ''[[Transition (literary journal)|Transition]]''. Harry Crosby and his wife [[Caresse Crosby|Caresse]] would establish the [[Mary Phelps Jacob|Black Sun Press]] in Paris in 1927, publishing works by such future luminaries as [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Archibald MacLeish]], [[James Joyce]], [[Kay Boyle]], [[Hart Crane]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[John Dos Passos]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Dorothy Parker]] and others. As well, [[Bill Bird]] published through his ''Three Mountains Press'' until British heiress [[Nancy Cunard]] took it over.

[[File:LaCloseriedesLilas.jpg|thumb|right|Cafés rented tables to poor artists for hours at a stretch. Several, including La Closerie des Lilas, remain in business today.]]

The cafés and bars of Montparnasse were a meeting place where ideas were hatched and mulled over. The cafés at the centre of Montparnasse's night-life were in the Carrefour Vavin, now renamed Place Pablo-Picasso. In Montparnasse's heyday (from 1910 to 1920), the cafés ''[[Le Dôme Café|Le Dôme]]'', ''La Closerie des Lilas'', ''[[Café de la Rotonde|La Rotonde]]'', ''Le Select'', and ''La Coupole''—all of which are still in business— were the places where starving artists could occupy a table all evening for a few ''centimes''. If they fell asleep, the waiters were instructed not to wake them. Arguments were common, some fuelled by intellect, others by alcohol, and if there were fights, and there often were, the police were never summoned. If you couldn't pay your bill, people such as La Rotonde's proprietor, [[Victor Libion]], would often accept a drawing, holding it until the artist could pay. As such, there were times when the café's walls were littered with a collection of artworks, that today would make the curators of the world's greatest museums drool with envy.

There were many areas where the great artists congregated, one of them being near Le Dôme at no. 10 rue Delambre called the [[Dingo Bar]]. It was the hang-out of artists and expatriate Americans and the place where Canadian writer [[Morley Callaghan]] came with his friend [[Ernest Hemingway]], both still unpublished writers, and met the already-established [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]. When [[Man Ray]]'s friend and [[Dadaism|Dadaist]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], left for New York City, Man Ray set up his first studio at l'Hôtel des Ecoles at no. 15 rue Delambre. This is where his career as a photographer began, and where [[James Joyce]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Jean Cocteau]] and the others filed in and posed in black and white.

The ''rue de la Gaité'' in Montparnasse was the site of many of the great [[music-hall]] theatres, in particular the famous "[[Bobino]]".
[[Image:ClubBobino.jpg|upright|left|frame|Great artists performed at the Bobino Nightclub.]]

On their stages, using then-popular single name pseudonyms or one birth name only, [[Marie-Louise Damien|Damia]], [[Alice Prin|Kiki]], [[Félix Mayol|Mayol]] and [[Georges Guibourg|Georgius]], sang and performed to packed houses. And here too, [[Les Six]] was formed, creating music based on the ideas of [[Erik Satie]] and [[Jean Cocteau]].

The poet [[Max Jacob]] said he came to Montparnasse to "sin disgracefully", but [[Marc Chagall]] summed it up differently when he explained why he had gone to Montparnasse: "I aspired to see with my own eyes what I had heard of from so far away: this revolution of the eye, this rotation of colours, which spontaneously and astutely merge with one another in a flow of conceived lines. That could not be seen in my town. The sun of Art then shone only on Paris."

While the area attracted people who came to live and work in the creative, [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] environment, it also became home for political exiles such as [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky]], [[Porfirio Diaz]], and [[Simon Petlyura]]. But, World War II forced the dispersal of the artistic society, and after the war Montparnasse never regained its splendour. Wealthy socialites like [[Peggy Guggenheim]], an art collector who married artist [[Max Ernst]], lived in the elegant section of Paris but frequented the studios of Montparnasse, acquiring pieces that would come to be recognized as masterpieces that now hang in the [[Peggy Guggenheim Collection|Peggy Guggenheim Museum]] in Venice, Italy.

The [[Musée du Montparnasse]] opened in 1998 at 21 [[Avenue du Maine]] and closed in 2015. Although operating with a tiny city grant, the museum was a non-profit operation.

The [[Nativity of Jesus]] has been a major subject of [[Christian art]] since the 4th century.

The artistic depictions of the ''Nativity'' or birth of [[Jesus]], celebrated at [[Christmas]], are based on the narratives in the Bible, in the [[Gospel]]s of [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]] and [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], and further elaborated by written, oral and artistic tradition. Christian art includes a great many representations of the [[Virgin Mary]] and the [[Child Jesus|Christ Child]]. Such works are generally referred to as the "[[Madonna (art)|Madonna and Child]]" or "Virgin and Child". They are not usually representations of the ''Nativity'' specifically, but are often devotional objects representing a particular aspect or attribute of the Virgin Mary, or Jesus. ''Nativity'' pictures, on the other hand, are specifically illustrative, and include many narrative details; they are a normal component of the sequences illustrating both the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]] and the [[Life of the Virgin]].

The Nativity has been depicted in many different media, both pictorial and sculptural. Pictorial forms include murals, [[panel painting]]s, [[manuscript illumination]]s, [[stained glass]] windows and [[oil painting]]s. The subject of the Nativity is often used for [[altarpiece]]s, many of these combining both painted and sculptural elements. Other sculptural representations of the Nativity include ivory miniatures, carved stone sarcophagi, architectural features such as capitals and door lintels, and free standing sculptures.

Free-standing sculptures may be grouped into a [[Nativity scene]] (crib, ''creche'' or ''presepe'') within or outside a church, home, public place or natural setting. The scale of the figures may range from miniature to life-sized. These Nativity scenes probably derived from acted ''[[tableau vivant]]s'' in Rome, although Saint [[Francis of Assisi]] gave the tradition a great boost. This tradition continues to this day, with small versions made of [[porcelain]], plaster, plastic or cardboard sold for display in the home. The acted scenes evolved into the [[Nativity play]].

== The wider Nativity story in art ==
[[File:Spišské Podhradie Narodenie (1490).jpg|thumb|The stable is just outside the city walls, with the shepherds on the hill behind; Slovakia, c. 1490]]
The scope of the subject matter which relates to the Nativity story begins with the [[genealogy of Jesus]] as listed in the Gospels of both Matthew and Luke. This lineage, or [[family tree]] is often depicted visually with a [[Tree of Jesse]], springing from the side of [[Jesse]], the father of [[King David]].

The Gospels go on to relate that a virgin, Mary, was betrothed to a man [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], but before she became fully his wife, an [[angel]] appeared to her, announcing that she would give birth to a baby who would be the [[Son of God]]. This incident, referred to as the [[Annunciation]] is often depicted in art. Matthew's Gospel relates that an angel dispelled Joseph's distress at discovering Mary's pregnancy, and instructed him to name the child Jesus (meaning "God saves").&lt;ref&gt;Matthew:1:21. The name Jesus is the Biblical Greek form of the Hebrew name Joshua meaning "God, our salvation".&lt;/ref&gt; This scene is depicted only occasionally.

In Luke's Gospel, Joseph and Mary travelled to [[Bethlehem]], the family of Joseph's ancestors, to be listed in a tax census; the Journey to Bethlehem is a very rare subject in the West, but shown in some large Byzantine cycles.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:58&lt;/ref&gt; While there, Mary gave birth to the infant, in a stable, because there was no room available in the inns. At this time, an angel appeared to shepherds on a hillside, telling them that the "Saviour, Christ the Lord" was born. The shepherds went to the stable and found the baby, wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in the feed trough, or "manger", as the angel had described.

In the liturgical calendar, the Nativity is followed by the [[Circumcision of Christ]] on January 1, which is mentioned only in passing in the Gospels,&lt;ref&gt;Luke 2:21&lt;/ref&gt; and which is assumed to have taken place according to Jewish law and custom, and the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]] (or "Candlemas"), celebrated on February 2, and described by Luke.&lt;ref&gt;The dates vary slightly between churches and calendars – see the respective articles. In particular, the [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches celebrate the visit of the Magi, as well as the Nativity, on December 25th of their [[Julian calendar|liturgical calendar]], which is January 7th of the usual [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;/ref&gt; Both have iconographic traditions, not covered here.

The narrative is taken up in the Gospel of Matthew, and relates that "wise men" from the east saw a [[Star of Bethlehem|star]], and followed it, believing it would lead them to a new-born king. On arriving in Jerusalem they proceed to the palace where a king might be found, and enquire from the resident despot, King Herod. Herod is worried about being supplanted, but he sends them out, asking them return when they have found the child. They follow the star to Bethlehem, where they give the child gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. The men are then warned in a dream that Herod wished to kill the child, and so return to their country another way. Although the gospel mentions neither the number nor the status of the wise men, known as "the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]]", tradition has extrapolated that since there were three gifts, there were three wise men, who are generally also given the rank of king, and so they are also called the "Three Kings". It is as kings that they are almost always depicted in art after about 900.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:105&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of subjects but the [[Adoration of the Magi]], when they present their gifts, and, in Christian tradition, worship Jesus, has always been much the most popular.

Either the [[Annunciation to the Shepherds]] by the angel, or the [[Adoration of the Shepherds]], which shows the shepherds worshipping the infant Christ, have often been combined with the Nativity proper, and the visit of the Magi, since very early times. The former represented the spreading of the message of Christ to the Jewish people, and the latter to the heathen peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:60&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
[[File:Kerald (Meister des Codex Egberti) 001.jpg|thumb|[[Massacre of the Innocents]], [[Egbert, Archbishop of Trier|Codex Egberti]], late 10th century.]]

There are also many detailed series of artworks, ranging from stained glass to carved capitals to fresco cycles that depict every aspect of the story, which formed part of both of the two most popular subjects for cycles: the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' and the ''[[Life of the Virgin]]''. It is also one of the [[Twelve Great Feasts]] of [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], a popular cycle in [[Byzantine art]].

The story continues with [[Herod the Great|King Herod]] asking his advisers about ancient prophesies describing the birth of such a child. As a result of their advice, he sends soldiers to kill every boy child under the age of two in the city of Bethlehem. But Joseph has been warned in a dream, and flees to Egypt with Mary and the baby, Jesus. The gruesome scene of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]], as the murder of the babies is generally referred, was particularly depicted by Early Renaissance and [[Baroque]] painters. The [[Flight into Egypt]] was another popular subject, showing Mary with the baby on a donkey, led by Joseph (borrowing the older iconography of the rare Byzantine ''Journey to Bethlehem'').

[[File:Toppling of the Pagan Idols (Bedford Master).jpg|thumb|left|Gothic toppling idol on the flight]]

From the [[Early Netherlandish painting|15th century in the Netherlands]] onwards, it was more usual to show the non-Biblical subject of the [[Holy Family]] resting on the journey, the ''Rest on the Flight to Egypt'', often accompanied by angels, and in earlier images sometimes an older boy who may represent, [[James the Brother of the Lord]], interpreted as a son of Joseph, by a previous marriage.&lt;ref&gt;The subject only emerges in the second half of the 14th century. Schiller:124. In some Orthodox traditions the older boy is the one who protects Joseph from the "shepherd-tempter" in the main Nativity scene.&lt;/ref&gt; The background to these scenes usually (until the [[Council of Trent]] tightened up on such additions to scripture) includes a number of apocryphal [[miracle]]s, and gives an opportunity for the emerging genre of [[landscape painting]]. In the ''Miracle of the Corn'' the pursuing soldiers interrogate peasants, asking when the Holy Family passed by. The peasants truthfully say it was when they were sowing their [[wheat]] seed; however the wheat has miraculously grown to full height. In the ''Miracle of the Idol'' a pagan statue falls from its plinth as the infant Jesus passes by, and a spring gushes up from the desert (originally separate, these are often combined). In further, less commonly seen, legends a group of robbers abandon their plan to rob the travellers, and a [[date palm]] tree bends down to allow them to pluck the fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:117–123. The date palm incident is also in the [[Quran]]. There are two different falling statue legends, one related to the arrival of the family at the Egyptian city of Sotina, and the other usually shown in open country. Sometimes both are shown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another subject is the meeting of the infant Jesus with his cousin, the infant [[John the Baptist]], who, according to legend was rescued from Bethlehem before the massacre by the [[Archangel Uriel]], and joined the Holy Family in Egypt. This meeting of the two Holy Children was to be painted many artists during the Renaissance period, after being popularized by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and then [[Raphael]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Leonardo's [[Virgin of the Rocks]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the Depiction ==

=== Early Christianity ===
[[File:Adoration magi Pio Christiano Inv31459.jpg|thumb|Magi bearing gifts, 4th-century sarcophagus, Rome]]
The earliest pictorial representations of Jesus' Nativity come from [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] in [[Rome]] and [[Gallia Narbonensis|Southern Gaul]] of around this date.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:59&lt;/ref&gt; They are later than the first scenes of the [[Adoration of the Magi]], which appears in the [[catacombs of Rome]], where [[Early Christian]]s buried their dead, often decorating the walls of the underground passages and vaults with paintings. Many of these predate the legalisation of Christian worship by the [[Emperor Constantine]] in the early 4th century. Typically the Magi move in step together, holding their gifts in front of them, towards a seated Virgin with Christ on her lap. They closely resemble the motif of [[tribute]]-bearers which is common in the art of most Mediterranean and Middle-Eastern cultures, and goes back at least two millennia earlier in the case of Egypt; in contemporary Roman art defeated barbarians carry golden wreaths towards an enthroned Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:9821 - Milano - Sant'Ambrogio - Sarcofago di Stilicone - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto 25-Apr-2007.jpg|thumb|left|4th-century sarcophagus, [[Milan]]; one of the earliest Nativity images]]
The earliest representations of the Nativity itself are very simple, just showing the infant, tightly wrapped, lying near the ground in a trough or [[wicker]] basket. The [[ox]] and [[donkey|ass]] are always present, even when Mary or any other human is not. Although they are not mentioned in the Gospel accounts they were regarded as confirmed by scripture from some [[Old Testament]] verses, such as [[Isaiah]] 1,3:"The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib" and [[Habakkuk]] 3,2: "in the midst of the two beasts wilt thou be known", and their presence was never questioned by theologians.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:60. In fact this sense of the Habakkuk is found in the Hebrew and Greek Bibles, but [[Jerome]]'s Latin [[Vulgate]], followed by the [[Authorised Version]], translates differently:"O Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known" in the AV&lt;/ref&gt; They were regarded by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[Ambrose]] and others as representing the [[Jewish]] people, weighed down by the Law (the ox), and the pagan peoples, carrying the sin of idolatry (the ass). Christ was arrived to free both from their burdens. Mary is only shown when the scene is the ''Adoration of the Magi'', but often one of the shepherds, or a [[prophet]] with a [[scroll]], is present. From the end of the 5th century (following the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]]), Mary becomes a fixture in the scene; then as later Joseph is a more variable element. Where a building is shown, it is usually a ''tugurium'', a simple tiled roof supported by posts.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:59–62&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Byzantine image ===
[[File:Mural - Birth of Christ.jpg|thumb|Modern Greek Orthodox mural in [[Jordan]], using a depiction little changed in over a millennium.]]

A new form of the image, which from the rare early versions seems to have been formulated in 6th-century [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], was to set the essential form of [[Eastern Orthodox]] images down to the present day. The setting is now a cave – or rather the specific Cave of the Nativity in Bethlehem, already underneath the [[Church of the Nativity]], and well-established as a place of [[pilgrimage]], with the approval of the Church. Above the opening a mountain, represented in miniature, rises up.&lt;ref&gt;The mountain follows Scriptural verses such as Habakkuk 3.3 "God [came] from Mount Paran", and the title of Mary as "Holy mountain". Schiller:63&lt;/ref&gt; Mary now lies recovering on a large stuffed cushion or couch ("kline" in Greek) beside the infant, who is on a raised structure,&lt;ref&gt;partly reflecting the arrangement in the Church of the Nativity, where pilgrims already peered under an altar into the actual cave (now the altar is much higher). The actual altar is sometimes shown. Schiller:63&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Joseph rests his head on his hand.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:62-3&lt;/ref&gt; He is often part of a separate scene in the foreground, where Jesus is being bathed by midwives (Jesus is therefore shown twice). Despite the less than ideal conditions, Mary is [[lying-in]], the term for the period of enforced [[bed rest]] in the [[postpartum period]] after [[childbirth]] that was prescribed until modern times.  The midwife or midwives come from early apocryphal sources; the main one is usually called [[Salome (disciple)|Salome]], and has her own ''miracle of the withered hand'', although this is rare in art. They featured in most medieval dramas and [[mystery play]]s of the Nativity, which often influenced painted depictions. Several apocryphal accounts speak of a great light illuminating the scene, also taken to be the [[Star of Bethlehem#Eastern Orthodoxy|star]] of the [[Biblical Magi|Magi]], and this is indicated by a circular disc at the top of the scene, with a band coming straight down from it – both are often dark in colour.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

The Magi may be shown approaching at the top left on horseback, wearing strange pillbox-like headgear, and the shepherds at the right of the cave. Angels usually surround the scene if there is room, including the top of the cave; often one is telling the shepherds the good news of Christ's birth. The figure of an old man, often dressed in animal skins, who begins as one of the shepherds in early depictions, but later sometimes addresses Joseph, is usually interpreted as the Prophet [[Isaiah]], or a hermit repeating his prophecy, though in later Orthodox depictions he sometimes came to be regarded as the "Tempter" (the "shepherd-tempter"), an Orthodox term for [[Satan]], who is encouraging Joseph to doubt the Virgin Birth.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:66. In late  works a young man may fend the tempter off. See: Léonid Ouspensky, ''The Meaning of Icons'', p. 160, 1982, [[St Vladimir's Seminary]], {{ISBN|0-913836-99-0}}. In pp.157–160 there is a full account of the later Orthodox iconography of the Nativity.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Orthodox icon of the Nativity uses certain imagery parallel to that on the [[epitaphios (liturgy)|epitaphios]] ([[burial shroud]] of Jesus) and other icons depicting the [[burial of Jesus]] on [[Good Friday]].  This is done intentionally to illustrate the [[theology|theological]] point that the purpose of the [[Incarnation of Christ]] was to make possible the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]]. The [[icon]] of the Nativity depicts the [[Christ Child]] wrapped in [[swaddling clothes]] reminiscent of his burial wrappings. The child is often shown lying on a stone, representing the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb of Christ]], rather than a [[manger]]. The Cave of the Nativity is also a reminder of the cave in which Jesus was buried. Some icons of the Nativity show the Virgin Mary kneeling rather than reclining, indicating the tradition that the [[Theotokos]] gave birth to Christ without pain (to contradict the perceived [[heresy]] in [[Nestorianism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Sources of light are the infant Jesus, the shepherds' fire on the hill behind, and the angel who appears to them.]]
The West adopted many of the Byzantine iconographic elements, but preferred the stable rather than the cave, though [[Duccio]]'s Byzantine-influenced [[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà]] version tries to have both. The midwives gradually dropped out from Western depictions, as Latin theologians disapproved of these legends; sometimes the bath remains, either being got ready or with Mary bathing Jesus. The midwives are still seen where Byzantine influence is strong, especially in Italy; as in [[Giotto]], one may hand Jesus over to his mother. During the Gothic period, in the North earlier than in Italy, increasing closeness between mother and child develops, and Mary begins to hold her baby, or he looks over to her. Suckling is very unusual, but is sometimes shown.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:74&lt;/ref&gt;

The image in later medieval Northern Europe was often influenced by the vision of the Nativity of Saint [[Bridget of Sweden]] (1303–1373), a very popular mystic. Shortly before her death, she described a vision of the infant Jesus as lying on the ground, and emitting light himself, and describes the Virgin as blond-haired; many depictions reduced other light sources in the scene to emphasize this effect, and the Nativity remained very commonly treated with [[chiaroscuro]] through to the Baroque. Other details such as a single candle "attached to the wall", and the presence of [[God the Father]] above, also come from Bridget's vision:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...the virgin knelt down with great veneration in an attitude of prayer, and her back was turned to the manger.... And while she was standing thus in prayer, I saw the child in her womb move and suddenly in a moment she gave birth to her son, from whom radiated such an ineffable light and splendour, that the sun was not comparable to it, nor did the candle that St. Joseph had put there, give any light at all, the divine light totally annihilating the material light of the candle.... I saw the glorious infant lying on the ground naked and shining. His body was pure from any kind of soil and impurity. Then I heard also the singing of the angels, which was of miraculous sweetness and great beauty...&lt;ref&gt;Quoted Schiller:78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; After this the Virgin kneels to pray to her child, to be joined by Saint Joseph, and this (technically known as the "Adoration of Christ" or "of the Child") becomes one of the commonest depictions in the 15th century, largely replacing the reclining Virgin in the West. Versions of this depiction occur as early as 1300, well before Bridget's vision, and have a [[Franciscan]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:76-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pierre Bladelin Triptych central panel WGA.jpg|thumb|left|250|This Nativity by [[Rogier van der Weyden]], part of the [[Bladelin Altarpiece]], follows Bridget's vision, with [[donor portrait]] and Romanesque ruins]]

[[Saint Joseph]], traditionally regarded as an old man, is often shown asleep in Nativities, and became a somewhat comical figure in some depictions, untidily dressed, and unable to help with proceedings. In some depictions, mostly German, he wears a [[Jewish hat]].&lt;ref&gt;For example Schiller, figs. 173 &amp; 175, both from [[Lower Saxony]] between 1170 and 1235, &amp; fig. 183, 14th century German.&lt;/ref&gt;  In medieval [[mystery play]]s, he was usually a comic figure, amiable but somewhat incapable, although he is sometimes showing cutting up his [[hose (clothing)|hose]] to make the swaddling-cloth for the child,&lt;ref&gt;from about 1400; apparently this detail comes from popular songs. Schiller:80&lt;/ref&gt; or lighting a fire. 

Saint Joseph's cult was increasingly promoted in the late Middle Ages in the West, by the [[Franciscan]]s and others. His feast was added to the Roman [[Breviary]] in 1479. By the 15th century he is often more dignified, and this improvement continued through the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]], until a resurgence of Marian emphasis in the 17th century again often leaves him stranded on the margins of Nativity compositions. The candle lit by Saint Joseph in Bridget's vision becomes an attribute, which he is often shown holding, lit or unlit, in broad daylight.

In a fully illuminated [[Book of hours]] it was normal to include pages illustrating all four of the ''Nativity'', the ''Announcement to the Shepherds'', the ''Adoration of the Magi'' and the ''Flight into Egypt'' (and/or the ''Massacre of the Innocents'') as part of the eight images in the sequence of the [[Hours of the Virgin]].&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, John, ''The Book of Hours'',p.28 , 1977, Thomas Y Crowell Company, New York, {{ISBN|0-690-01654-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nativity images became increasing popular in panel paintings in the 15th century, although on [[altarpiece]]s the [[Holy Family]] often had to share the picture space with [[donor portrait]]s. In [[Early Netherlandish painting]] the usual simple shed, little changed from Late Antiquity, developed into an elaborate ruined temple, initially [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] in style, which represented the dilapidated state of the [[Covenant (biblical)|Old Covenant]] of the [[Jewish law]]. The use of Romanesque architecture to identify Jewish rather than Christian settings is a regular feature of the paintings of [[Jan van Eyck]] and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, pp. 49–50.

In fact the Basilica was built in the 4th century. Some later painters used the remains as a basis for their depictions.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Renaissance and after ===
From the 15th century onwards, the [[Adoration of the Magi]] increasingly became a more common depiction than the Nativity proper, partly as the subject lent itself to many pictorial details and rich colouration, and partly as paintings became larger, with more space for the more crowded subject. The scene is increasingly conflated with the ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' from the late Middle Ages onwards, though they have been shown combined on occasions since [[Late Antiquity]]. In the West the Magi developed large exotically-dressed retinues, which sometimes threaten to take over the composition by the time of the Renaissance; there is undoubtedly a loss of concentration on the religious meaning of the scenes in some examples, especially in 15th-century [[Florence]], where large secular paintings were still a considerable novelty. The large and famous wall-painting of the ''Procession of the Magi'' in the [[Magi Chapel]] of the [[Palazzo Medici]] there, painted by [[Benozzo Gozzoli]] in 1459–1461 and full of portraits of the family, only reveals its religious subject by its location in a chapel, and its declared title. There are virtually no indications that this is the subject contained in the work itself, although the altarpiece for the chapel was the ''[[Adoration in the Forest (Lippi)|Adoration in the Forest]]'' by [[Filippo Lippi]] (now Berlin).

[[File:Magi St Andrews.JPG|thumb|250px|''The Magi'', stained glass by John Hardman and Co in [[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney]]]]

From the 16th century plain Nativities with just the Holy Family, become a clear minority, though [[Caravaggio]] led a return to a more realistic treatment of the ''Adoration of the Shepherds''. The compositions, as with most religious scenes, becomes more varied as artistic originality becomes more highly regarded than iconographic tradition; the works illustrated by [[Gerard van Honthorst]], [[Georges de La Tour]], and [[Charles Le Brun]] of the ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' all show different poses and actions by Mary, none quite the same as the traditional ones. The subject becomes surprisingly uncommon in the artistic mainstream after the 18th century, even given the general decline in religious painting. [[William Blake's illustrations of On the Morning of Christ's Nativity|William Blake's illustrations of ''On the Morning of Christ's Nativity'']] are a typically esoteric treatment in [[watercolour]].  [[Edward Burne-Jones]], working with [[Morris &amp; Co.]], produced major works on the theme, with a set of stained glass windows at [[Trinity Church, Boston]] (1882), a tapestry of the [[Adoration of the Magi (tapestry)|''Adoration of the Magi'']] (ten copies, from 1890) and a [[Star of Bethlehem (painting)|painting of the same subject]] (1887). Popular religious depictions have continued to flourish, despite the competition from secular Christmas imagery.

[[File:Arrian, Periplus.jpg|thumb|Beginning of the Arrian Periplous Euxeinou Pontou of Johann Froben and Nicolaus Episcopius, Basel 1533]]
A '''periplus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛr|ɪ|p|l|ʌ|s}}) is a manuscript document that lists the ports and coastal landmarks, in order and with approximate intervening distances, that the captain of a vessel could expect to find along a shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Source Book in Geography|first=George|last=Kish|page=21|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1978|isbn=0-674-82270-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_6qF4vjZvhYC }}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense the periplus was a type of log. It served the same purpose as the later Roman [[itinerarium]] of road stops; however, the Greek navigators added various notes, which if they were professional geographers (as many were) became part of their own additions to Greek geography.

The form of the ''periplus'' is at least as old as the earliest Greek historian, the Ionian [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]. The works of [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] contain passages that appear to have been based on ''peripli''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=40|title=Josephus Geographicus: The Classical Context of Geography in Josephus|first=Yuval|last=Shahar|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|year=2004|isbn=3-16-148256-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pIJLJSYFogUC&amp;pg=PA40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
''Periplus'' is the Latinization of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] word περίπλους (''periplous'', contracted from περίπλοος ''periploos''), is "a sailing-around." Both segments, ''peri-'' and ''-plous'', were independently [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]]: the ancient Greek speaker understood the word in its literal sense; however, it developed a few specialized meanings, one of which became a standard term in the ancient navigation of [[Phoenicians]], [[Greeks]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

==Known ''peripli''==
Several examples of ''peripli'' that are known to scholars:

=== Carthaginian ===

*The Periplus of [[Himilco the Navigator]], parts which are preserved in [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Avienus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Purcell (classicist)|Nicholas Purcell]] "Himilco" in ''[[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]'' 3rd. ed. [[Oxford]]; [[Oxford University Press]] 1999 p.707&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Hanno the Navigator#Periplus account|Periplus]] of [[Hanno the Navigator]], [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] colonist and explorer who explored the coast of [[Africa]] from present-day [[Morocco]] southward at least as far as [[Senegal]] in the sixth or fifth century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |translator-first=H. |translator-last=Schoff |title=The Periplus of Hanno a voyage of discovery down the west African coast |year=1912 |url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL6541953M/The_Periplus_of_Hanno }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek ===

*The ''Periplus'' of the Greek [[Scylax of Caryanda]], in Caria, who allegedly sailed down the [[Indus River]] and then to [[Suez]] on the initiative of [[Darius I]]. This voyage is mentioned by [[Herodotus]], and his pleriplus is quoted by Hecataeus of Miletus, [[Aristotle]], [[Strabo]] and Avienus.&lt;ref&gt;"Scylax" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1374&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Massaliote Periplus]]'', a description of trade routes along the coasts of [[Atlantic Europe]], by anonymous Greek navigators of Massalia (now Marseille, France), possibly dates to the sixth century BCE, also preserved in Avienus&lt;ref&gt;"Periploi" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1141&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pytheas of Massilia]], (fourth century BCE) ''On the Ocean'' (Περί του Ωκεανού), has not survived; only excerpts remain, quoted or paraphrased by later authors, including Strabo, [[Diodorus Siculus]], Pliny the Elder  and in Avienus' ''Ora maritima''.&lt;ref&gt;"Pytheas" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1285&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax]]'', generally is thought to date to the fourth or third century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;"Scylax" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1374&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Pleriplus of [[Nearchus]] surveyed the area between the Indus and the Persian Gulf under orders from [[Alexander the Great]]. He was a source for Strabo and [[Arrian]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;"Periploi" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.1141&lt;/ref&gt;
*''On the Red Sea'' by [[Agatharchides]]. Fragments preserved in Diodorus Siculus and [[Photius]].&lt;ref&gt;"Agatharchides" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.36&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Periplus of [[Scymnus]] of [[Chios]] is dated to around 110&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;"Scymnus" in ''OCD''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; p.137436&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' or Red Sea was written by a Greek of the Hellenistic/Romanized [[Alexandria]]n in the first century CE. It provides a shoreline itinerary of the [[Red Sea|Red (Erythraean) Sea]], starting at the port of [[Berenice (port)|Berenice]]. Beyond the Red Sea, the manuscript describes the coast of India as far as the [[Ganges River]] and the east coast of Africa (called [[Azania]]). The unknown author of the ''Periplus of the Erythraean Sea'' claims that Hippalus, a mariner, was knowledgeable about the "monsoon winds" that shorten the round-trip from India to the Red Sea.{{sfn|Liu|2010|p=34}} Also according to the manuscript, the Horn of Africa was called, "the Cape of Spices,"{{sfn|Liu|2010|p=36}} and modern day Yemen was known as the "Frankincense Country."{{sfn|Liu|2010|p=37}}
*The ''[[Periplus Ponti Euxini]]'', a description of trade routes along the coasts of the [[Black Sea]], written by [[Arrian]] (in Greek Αρριανός) in the early second century CE.

==''Rahnāmag''==
[[Persia]]n sailors had long had their own sailing guide books, called ''Rahnāmag'' in [[Middle Persian]] (''Rahnāmeh'' رهنامه in [[Modern Persian]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dehkhoda |first=Ali Akbar |first2=Mohammad |last2=Moʻin |year=1958 |title=Loghat-namehʻi Dehkhoda |location=Tehran |publisher=Tehran University Press: Rahnāma }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They listed the ports and coastal landmarks and distances along the shores.

The lost but much-cited sailing directions go back at least to the 12th century. Some described the [[Indian Ocean]] as "a hard sea to get out of" and warned of the "circumambient sea," with all return impossible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Civilizations: Culture, Ambition, and the Transformation of Nature |first=Felipe |last=Fernandez-Armesto |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-7432-0248-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TJcSAQAAIAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tactic of naval combat==
A ''periplus'' was also an ancient naval manoeuvre in which attacking ''[[triremes]]'' would outflank or encircle the defenders to attack them in the rear.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

'''''Pretty Little Mistakes''''' is a book written by [[Heather McElhatton]] and published on May 1, 2007 by [[HarperCollins]].

The novel is written in [[Second-person narrative]] and allows the reader to direct where the story will go, similar to the [[Choose Your Own Adventure]] book series.  The book has more than 150 possible endings.  50% of the endings are "good" and 50% are "bad".  After an introduction to the story, the reader is asked to determine the protagonist's next course of action. After the reader makes a choice, the plot branches out leading to more decisions and eventually multiple possible endings.  Endings include the death of the protagonist and/or companions of the main character.

{{unreferenced|date=August 2012}}
In [[Programming language|computer programming]], a '''return code''' or an '''error code''' is an enumerated message that corresponds to the status of a specific [[software application]]. They are typically used to identify faults, such as those in faulty [[computer hardware|hardware]], [[software]], or incorrect user input.

==In systems software==

[[Exit status]] is the return code of computer programs running as [[process (computing)|processes]], and is communicated through [[system call]]s.

==In networking software==

[[Network protocol]]s typically support returning status codes. In the [[TCP/IP stack]], it's a common feature of higher level protocols. For example:

* [[List of HTTP status codes]]
* [[List of FTP server return codes]]
* [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol#Protocol overview]]

==Error codes and exception handling==
Error codes are used in various methods of solving the [[semipredicate problem]]. They are generally similar to [[exception handling]] in programming languages that support it.

Error codes are slowly disappearing from the programmer's environment as modern [[Object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] [[programming languages]] replace them with [[Exception handling|exceptions]].{{editorializing|date=April 2017}}{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Exceptions have the advantage of being handled with explicit blocks of code, separate from the rest of the code.  While it is considered poor practice in methodologies that use error codes and return codes to indicate failure, programmers often neglect to check return values for error conditions. That negligence can cause undesirable effects, as ignored error conditions often cause more severe problems later in the program. Exceptions are implemented in such a way as to separate the error handling code from the rest of the code. Separating the error handling code from the normal logic makes programs easier to write and understand, since one block of error handling code can service errors from any number of function calls. Exception handling also makes the code more readable than implementations with error codes, since exception handling does not disrupt the flow of the code with frequent checks for error conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2131">'''San Facio''', also commonly called the '''Chiesa del Foppone''', is a late [[Baroque architecture]], [[Roman Catholic]], now deconsecrated church in [[Cremona]], region of [[Lombardy, Italy]]. The church was completed in 1781, to officiate the burials in the surrounding ossuary of those dying in the adjacent hospital (Ospedale Maggiore e Ospedale Vecchio) of Cremona. It was called ''Foppone'' because of it operational similarity to the ''[[Nuovi Sepolcri, Milan|Nuovi Sepolcri]]'' (1695) in Milan. The surrounding large cemetery crypts in the portico formed part of an 18th-century urge to provide, systematize, and formalize the burials for the indigent.
[[File:Cremone Foppone.JPG|thumb|Church of il Foppone from inside courtyard.]]

From the courtyard, the architecture seems dour except for the domes of the church. The interior of the church in [[Greek Cross]] layout, is decorated by [[Giovanni Manfredini]] with [[Grotteschi]], an ornamentation then utilized in cemetery churches due to their prevalence in [[Roman catacombs]].

A guide from 1820 cites the first altar on the right of the entrance has a [[Michelangelo da Caravaggio|Caravaggesque]] canvas depicting ''Christ healing the blind man'', by [[Pietro Martire Neri]] or Negri. The main altarpiece is a ''Deposition from the Cross with the Virgin Mother, the Magdalen, and Joseph d' Arimathea'' (1569) by [[Vincenzo Campi]]. The altar on the left, has a ''Virgin and Child with [[San Facio]] with a Basket of Bread dispensing food to the poor and maimed'' (1593) by [[Andrea Mainardi]] (called ''il Chiaveghino'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PAFCAAAAcAAJ Nuova guida di Cremona], by Giuseppe Picenardi, Cremona, 1820, pages 196-202.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The site was closed for burials in the 1970s and administration transferred to the Commune.

The '''Symphony for Organ No. 6''' ('''Symphonie VI pour orgue''') in [[G minor]], [[Opus number|Op.]] 42, No. 2, is an [[organ symphony]] by [[Charles-Marie Widor]]. Completed in 1878, the composer premiered it at the [[Trocadéro#Palais du Trocadéro|Palais du Trocadéro]] as part of the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris World Exhibition]]. It was first published by [[Julien Hamelle|Hamelle]] in 1879, together with the famous [[Symphony for Organ No. 5 (Widor)|Symphony for Organ No. 5]].

== History ==
Widor composed the work, one of ten organ symphonies, when he was organist at [[Church of Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]], a post he held from 1870. The church features a main organ by [[Aristide Cavaillé-Coll]] which inspired the composer who wrote "If I had not experienced the seduction of these timbres or the mystical attraction of this wave of sound, I would never have written organ music."&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt; Widor's first four symphonies was published by J. Maho in 1872 as his Op. 13.&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt; The two following symphonies were published as his Op. 42 in 1879 by [[Julien Hamelle]], Maho's successor. They were reprinted in 1887, now with the revised first four, and the new No. VII and VIII, with a foreword by the composer regarding "the style, the procedures of registration and the signs".&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt; Widor often revised his works several times even after publication.&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt;

[[File:La salle de spectacle du Palais du Trocadéro en 1878 (6351200057).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Salle de spectacle in the [[Trocadéro#Palais du Trocadéro|Palais du Trocadéro]], model]]
Widor probably composed the Symphonie VI between his return from a visit to Bayreuth in 1876, where he attended the first [[Bayreuth Festival]], presenting the first performance of Wagner's ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'', and the summer of 1878. He premiered it for the inauguration of a Cavaillé-Coll organ at the [[Trocadéro#Palais du Trocadéro|Palais du Trocadéro]] in Paris on 24 August 1878 as part of the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris World Exhibition]].&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt;

A critical edition of Symponie VI was published by [[Carus-Verlag]] in 2015, based predominantly on the last edition during Widor's lifetime, 1929.&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt;

== Structure and music ==
The work is structured in five [[Movement (music)|movements]]:
# Allegro
# Adagio
# Intermezzo
# Cantabile
# Final

Widor's organ symphonies are not as much a structural unit, but extended [[Suite (music)|suites]] with orchestral sound. He wrote: "The modern organ is thus symphonic in essence. The new instrument demands a new language, an ideal differing from scholastic polyphony."&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt;

The first movement introduces a [[chorale]]-like [[Theme (music)|theme]], and expands in both [[sonata form]] and [[Variation (music)|variations]]. A [[recitative]]-episode becomes a second theme. The second movement, in three sections, present "sensual  chromaticism", with a registration of "Gambes et Voix célestes". According to [[Albert Schweitzer]], it was inspired by Wagner's music heard in Bayreuth. The third movement serves as a [[scherzo]]. Three voices receive a specific sound by the registration "Anches et cornets de 4 et de 8", like the [[grand jeu]] of the classical [[French organ school]]. The fourth movement has a lengthy theme, of which several [[Motif (music)|motif]]s are derived. The fifth movement is a sonata-rondo, culminating in a "tumultuous coda".&lt;ref name="Koch" /&gt;

[[File:Friedrich Nietzsche 1872.jpg|thumb|250px|First print 1872]]
'''''The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music''''' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik}}) is an 1872 work of [[dramatic theory]] by the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. It was reissued in 1886 as ''The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie, Oder: Griechentum und Pessimismus}}). The later edition contained a prefatory essay, "[[s:An Attempt at Self-Criticism|An Attempt at Self-Criticism]]", wherein Nietzsche commented on this earliest book.

== The Book ==

Nietzsche found in [[Theater of ancient Greece|classical Athenian]] [[tragedy]] an art form that transcended the [[pessimism]] and [[nihilism]] of a fundamentally meaningless world. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering and affirming it, passionately and joyously affirmed the meaning of their own existence. They knew themselves to be infinitely more than petty individuals, finding self-affirmation not in another life, not in a world to come, but in the terror and ecstasy alike celebrated in the performance of tragedies.

Originally educated as a [[philology|philologist]], Nietzsche discusses the history of the tragic form and introduces an intellectual [[dichotomy]] between the [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Dionysian and the Apollonian]] (very loosely: reality as disordered and undifferentiated by forms versus reality as ordered and differentiated by forms). Nietzsche claims life always involves a struggle between these two elements, each battling for control over the existence of humanity. In Nietzsche's words, "Wherever the Dionysian prevailed, the Apollonian was checked and destroyed.... wherever the first Dionysian onslaught was successfully withstood, the authority and majesty of the Delphic god [[Apollo]] exhibited itself as more rigid and menacing than ever." Yet neither side ever prevails due to each containing the other in an eternal, natural check or balance.

Nietzsche argues that the tragedy of Ancient Greece was the highest form of art due to its mixture of both Apollonian and Dionysian elements into one seamless whole, allowing the spectator to experience the full spectrum of the [[human condition]]. The Dionysian element was to be found in the music of the [[Greek chorus|chorus]], while the Apollonian element was found in the dialogue which gave a concrete symbolism that balanced the Dionysian revelry. Basically, the Apollonian spirit was able to give form to the abstract Dionysian.

Before the tragedy, there was an era of static, idealized plastic art in the form of sculpture that represented the Apollonian view of the world. The Dionysian element was to be found in the wild revelry of festivals and drunkenness, but, most importantly, in music. The combination of these elements in one art form gave birth to tragedy. He theorizes that the chorus was originally always [[satyr]]s, goat-men. (This is speculative, although the word “tragedy” τραγωδία is contracted from trag(o)-aoidiā = "goat song" from ''tragos'' = "goat" and ''aeidein'' = "to sing".) Thus, he argues, “the illusion of culture was wiped away by the primordial image of man” for the audience; they participated with and as the chorus empathetically, “so that they imagined themselves as restored natural geniuses, as satyrs.” But in this state, they have an Apollonian dream vision of themselves, of the energy they're embodying. It's a vision of the god, of Dionysus, who appears before the chorus on the stage. And the actors and the plot are the development of that dream vision, the essence of which is the ecstatic dismembering of the god and of the [[Bacchante]]s' rituals, of the inseparable ecstasy and suffering of human existence.

After the time of [[Aeschylus]] and [[Sophocles]], there was an age where tragedy died.  Nietzsche ties this to the influence of writers like [[Euripides]] and the coming of rationality, represented by [[Socrates]].  Euripides reduced the use of the chorus and was more naturalistic in his representation of human drama, making it more reflective of the realities of daily life. Socrates emphasized reason to such a degree that he diffused the value of myth and suffering to human knowledge. For Nietzsche, these two intellectuals helped drain the ability of the individual to participate in forms of art, because they saw things too soberly and rationally. The ''[[participation mystique]]'' aspect of art and myth was lost, and along with it, much of man's ability to live creatively in [[optimistic]] harmony with the sufferings of life. Nietzsche concludes that it may be possible to reattain the balance of Dionysian and Apollonian in modern art through the operas of [[Richard Wagner]], in a ''rebirth'' of tragedy.

In contrast to the typical [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] view of ancient Greek culture as noble, simple, elegant and grandiose, Nietzsche believed the Greeks were grappling with pessimism. The universe in which we live is the product of great interacting forces; but we neither observe nor know these as such. What we put together as our conceptions of the world, Nietzsche thought, never actually addresses the underlying realities. It is human destiny to be controlled by the darkest universal realities and, at the same time, to live life in a human-dreamt world of illusions.

The issue, then, or so Nietzsche thought, is how to experience and understand the Dionysian side of life without destroying the obvious values of the Apollonian side. It is not healthy for an individual, or for a whole society, to become entirely absorbed in the rule of one or the other. The soundest (healthiest) foothold is in both. Nietzsche's theory of Athenian tragic drama suggests exactly how, before Euripides and Socrates, the Dionysian and Apollonian elements of life were artistically woven together. The Greek spectator became healthy through direct experience of the Dionysian within the protective spirit-of-tragedy on the Apollonian stage.

==History==
In January and February 1870, Nietzsche delivered two lectures about ancient Greek drama. After receiving copies of the lectures, his friends Richard and [[Cosima Wagner]] suggested that he write a book about the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1871, he submitted a manuscript to publisher [[Wilhelm Engelmann]]. When Englemann was unresponsive, Nietzsche asked for the return of the manuscript in June. He had a portion of the book [[Vanity press|privately printed]] under the title ''Socrates and Greek Tragedy'' ({{lang-de|Sokrates und griechische Tragödie}}) and sent to friends. Richard Wagner received the first copy on 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1871, Nietzsche submitted a revised manuscript to E. W. Fritzsch, who had published works by Wagner. Fritzsch accepted the book in November.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Printing was completed at the end of December, and the book, now titled ''The Birth of Tragedy from the Spirit of Music'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie aus dem Geiste der Musik}}), reached bookstores on 2 January 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second edition was printed by Fritzsch in 1874, but due to the publisher's financial problems, it was not bound until 1875 and had little circulation. In 1878, the remaining copies and publication rights for the first two editions were acquired by Nietzsche's new publisher, Ernst Schmeitzner.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=65–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1886, Nietzsche had fallen out with Schmeitzner, and Fritzsch had recovered from his financial difficulties. Fritzsch published a new edition in October 1886, retitled ''The Birth of Tragedy, Or: Hellenism and Pessimism'' ({{lang-de|Die Geburt der Tragödie, Oder: Griechentum und Pessimismus}}), with an added prefatory essay by Nietzsche called "An Attempt at Self-Criticism", commenting on the earlier editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schaberg|1995|pp=131–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
''The Birth of Tragedy'' is a young man's work, and shows the influence of many of the philosophers Nietzsche had been studying. His interest in classical Greece as in some respects a rational society can be attributed in some measure to the influence of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], although Nietzsche departed from Winckelmann in many ways.  In addition, Nietzsche uses the term "naïve" in exactly the sense used by [[Friedrich Schiller]]. Of great importance are the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], especially ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''. The Apollonian experience bears great similarity to the experience of the world as "representation" in Schopenhauer's sense, and the experience of the Dionysian bears similarities to the identification with the world as "will." Nietzsche opposed Schopenhauer's Buddhistic negation of the will. He argued that life is worth living despite the enormous amount of cruelty and suffering that exists.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

One year before the publication of ‘’The Birth of Tragedy’’, Nietzsche wrote a fragment titled [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ljp2NPK0qPAC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=nietzsche+%2B+%22what+we+here+have+asserted%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vxdZT8bsHc6I0QGJt_DRDw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On Music and Words]. In it he asserted the Schopenhauerian judgment that  music is a primary expression of the essence of everything.  Secondarily derivative are lyrical poetry and drama, which represent mere phenomenal appearances of objects. In this way, tragedy is born from music.

== Reception ==
''The Birth of Tragedy'' was angrily criticized by many respected professional scholars of Greek literature. Particularly vehement was philologist [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], who denounced Nietzsche's work as slipshod and misleading. Prompted by Nietzsche, [[Erwin Rohde]]—a friend who had written a favorable review that sparked the first derogatory debate over the book—responded by exposing Wilamowitz-Moellendorf's inaccurate citations of Nietzsche's work. [[Richard Wagner]] also issued a response to Wilamowitz-Moellendorf's critique, but his action only served to characterize Nietzsche as the composer's lackey.

In his denunciation of ''The Birth of Tragedy'', Wilamowitz says:

:Herr N. ... is also a professor of classical philology; he treats a series of very important questions of Greek literary history. ... This is what I want to illuminate, and it is easy to prove that here also imaginary genius and impudence in the presentation of his claims stands in direct relation to his ignorance and lack of love of the truth. ... His solution is to belittle the historical-critical method, to scold any aesthetic insight which deviates from his own, and to ascribe a "complete misunderstanding of the study of antiquity" to the age in which philology in Germany, especially through the work of [[Gottfried Hermann]] and [[Karl Lachmann]], was raised to an unprecedented height.

In suggesting the Greeks might have had problems, Nietzsche was departing from the scholarly traditions of his age, which viewed the Greeks as a happy, perhaps even naive, and simple people. The work is a web of professional [[philology]], philosophical insight, and admiration of musical art. As a work in philology, it was almost immediately rejected, virtually destroying Nietzsche's academic aspirations. The music theme was so closely associated with Richard Wagner that it became an embarrassment to Nietzsche once he himself had achieved some distance and independence from Wagner. It stands, then, as Nietzsche's first complete, published philosophical work, one in which a battery of questions are asked, sketchily identified, and questionably answered.

Marianne Cowan, in her introduction to Nietzsche's ''[[Philosophy in the Tragic Age of the Greeks]]'', describes the situation in these words:
:''The Birth of Tragedy'' presented a view of the Greeks so alien to the spirit of the time and to the ideals of its scholarship that it blighted Nietzsche's entire academic career.  It provoked pamphlets and counter-pamphlets attacking him on the grounds of common sense, scholarship and sanity. For a time, Nietzsche, then a professor of classical philology at the [[University of Basel]], had no students in his field.  His lectures were sabotaged by German philosophy professors who advised their students not to show up for Nietzsche's courses.

By 1886, Nietzsche himself had reservations about the work, and he published a preface in the 1886 edition where he re-evaluated some of his main concerns and ideas in the text. In this post-script, Nietzsche referred to ''The Birth of Tragedy'' as "an impossible book... badly written, ponderous, embarrassing, image-mad and image-confused, sentimental, saccharine to the point of effeminacy, uneven in tempo, [and] without the will to logical cleanliness."&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, he defended the "arrogant and rhapsodic book" for inspiring "fellow-rhapsodizers" and for luring them on to "new secret paths and dancing places."

In 1888, in ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'', Nietzsche was back on the attack. He defends ''The Birth of Tragedy'' by stating: "...It is indifferent toward politics,—'un-German,' to use the language of the present time—it smells offensively Hegelian, and the cadaverous perfume of Schopenhauer sticks only to a few formulas. An 'idea'—the antithesis of the Dionysian and the Apollinian—translated into the metaphysical; history itself as the development of this 'idea'; in tragedy this antithesis is sublimated into a unity; under this perspective things that had never before faced each other are suddenly juxtaposed, used to illuminate each other, and comprehended... Opera, for example, and the revolution.— The two decisive innovations of the book are, first, its understanding of the Dionysian phenomenon among the Greeks: for the first time, a psychological analysis of this phenomenon is offered, and it is considered as one root of the whole of Greek art. The other is the understanding of Socratism: Socrates is recognized for the first time as an instrument of Greek disintegration, as a typical décadent. 'Rationality' against instinct. 'Rationality' at any price as a dangerous force that undermines life!— Profound, hostile silence about Christianity throughout the book. That is neither Apollinian nor Dionysian; it negates all aesthetic values—the only values that the 'Birth of Tragedy' recognizes: it is nihilistic in the most profound sense, while in the Dionysian symbol the ultimate limit of affirmation is attained. There is one allusion [The Birth of Tragedy, 24] to Christian priests as a 'vicious kind of dwarfs' who are 'subterranean' ..."

In the title of his novel ''[[The Magic Mountain]]'', [[Thomas Mann]] alludes to a passage from ''The Birth of Tragedy'', and the influence of Nietzsche's work can be seen in the novel's character Mynheer Peepercorn, who embodies the "Dionysian principle."&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, Friedrich, ''The Birth of Tragedy'' (Trans. Douglas Smith), Oxford University Press, 2008: pp. xxxii, 28, 109, 140. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954014-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the context of a critical study of Nietzsche's "atheist humanism", the influential Catholic theologian [[Henri de Lubac]] considered it "a work of genius", and dedicated several pages of his study to explicate the relationship between Nietzsche's early thought and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;De Lubac, Henri, ''The Drama of Atheist Humanism'', Ignatius Press (San Francisco), 2008: pp. 74, 82. For De Lubac's full discussion of this early work of Nietzsche, see ''id''., pp. 73–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9750">'''The Grand Teddy tea-rooms paintings''' is a collective name for three [[Distemper (paint)|glue distemper]] oval paintings executed by [[Édouard Vuillard]] for Le Grand Teddy tea-rooms in Paris in 1918. The largest is privately owned, but is sometimes exhibited. One of the smaller works (identified in Vuillard's notes as ''The Cafe'') was featured on an episode of the BBC television programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' which first broadcast on 19 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fake or Fortune? – Series 3 – 1.

==Origin==
The Grand Teddy tea-rooms paintings are three oval paintings in glue distemper on canvas by Édouard Vuillard commissioned by interior designer Francis Jourdain to hang on the walls of the Grand Teddy bar and cafe in Paris. They were painted in 1918. With the closure of the cafe in 1922, the paintings were bought by Jos Hessel, Vuillard's friend and art dealer.

==BBC's ''Fake or Fortune?''==
[[File:Edouard Vuillard The Cafe.jpg|thumb|''The Café'' (1918) by Edouard Vuillard]]
Keith Tutt, an author and scriptwriter from Norfolk, fell in love with the work of French post-Impressionist painter Édouard Vuillard during his art classes at [[Tonbridge School]] and purchased a painting, thought to be one of the two smaller Grand Teddy works, at auction for approximately UK£11,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.otsociety.tonbridge-school.co.uk/news/article/date/2014/01/ot-painting-features-on-fake-or-fortune/|title=Old Tonbridgian Society|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He contacted the BBC programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'', in an attempt to gain their help in authenticating his work.

Tutt's vertical oval painting, titled ''The Café'', depicts an oblique elevated view of a café interior, with a group of women seated on a [[banquette]]. It was thought to be one of the three paintings commissioned from Vuillard in 1918 to decorate "Le Grand Teddy". The main painting  of the commission, ''Le Grand Teddy'', is currently privately owned and kept in secure storage in [[Geneva, Switzerland]], and, at the time the program was made, it was the only one of the three known to still exist, and to have been fully confirmed as a genuine Vuillard. With assistance from art experts and archivists in Britain, France and the Netherlands, the program undertook an exhaustive investigation and analysis of the Tutt painting, and they were given special permission by the owners of ''Le Grand Teddy'' to view it, to examine it using infra-red and ultra-violet light, and to take minute samples of the paint and canvas for scientific analysis. This showed that both paintings were virtually identical, both in the type of canvas used, and the medium with which Vuillard had painted the works. This was a relatively unusual compound of animal glue and pigment, called [[Distemper (paint)|glue distemper]], which Vuillard had learned to use in his early career, while working as a theatrical scenery painter. He was thought to have chosen glue distemper for the Grand Teddy commission in part because its unvarnished matte surface did not reflect the bright electric lights then coming into common use. 

The program's team was also able to visit the [[Bibliotheque Nationale]] in Paris, where they discovered the original interior design drawings for ''Le Grand Teddy'', showing how the paintings would have been placed. An investigation of the provenance traced the ownership back from Tutt, through Robert Warren and a previous owner, to British theatrical manager [[Charles B. Cochran|Charles Cochran]]. The program's art historian [[Bendor Grosvenor]] was able to locate an article in ''[[Windsor Magazine]]'', from 1933, which specifically mentioned both ''The Café'' and ''The Oysters'' as being in Cochran's possession at the time. Following the clue provided by a damaged shipping label on the back of ''The Café'', the program was finally able to locate contemporary Dutch newspaper reviews from 1926, which described both paintings in great detail, and thus confirming that after the Grand Teddy had closed, Vuillard's dealer [[:fr:Jos Hessel|Jos Hessel]] had placed the two smaller paintings in an exhibition in the Netherlands, from where they were thought to have been seen and purchased by Cochran. 

After submitting all the evidence to a committee at the secretive and highly conservative [[Wildenstein Institute]] in Paris, Tutt and the ''Fake or Fortune?'' team learned that the committee had unanimously agreed ''The Café'' to be a genuine work, and that it would henceforward be incorporated into the ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'' of Vuillard. As a result of this validation, the painting was estimated to be worth at least UK£200,00–£300,000.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nJx4x5I5j4 BBC TV - ''Fake or Fortune?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The missing work==
Following their ''Fake or Fortune''  programme, the BBC issued an appeal to trace the missing third painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-22030020|title=Missing painting sought by BBC|date=4 April 2013|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; purchased on [[eBay]] in 2005 and now with an estimated value of £250,000.&lt;ref name="Indy" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6276">"'''The Light-House'''" is the unofficial title of the last work written by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. He [[unfinished work|did not live to finish it]], and had barely begun it by the time of [[death of Edgar Allan Poe|his death]] in 1849.

==Plot summary==
The story is told as a series of [[diary]] entries, the first being [[New Year's Day]], 1796.  The setting is an island off the coast of Norway.

On January 1, the narrator records that it is his first day in the [[lighthouse]], and records his annoyance at the fact that he had a difficult time getting the appointment to man it, even though he is of noble birth.  He records that a storm is in progress, and that the ship that brought him "had a narrow pass".  He also dwells on the concept of being alone, and how much he looks forward to spending time alone, just him and his dog Neptune, so he can write his book.  He briefly comments that he hears some echo in the walls, thinking they may not be sturdy, but catches himself and claims that his worries are "all nonsense", alluding to a prophecy made by his friend DeGrat, who got him the appointment to the lighthouse.

On January 2 he describes the sea as being calm and uneventful, the wind having "lulled about day-break", and expounds on his passion for being alone.

On January 3 he describes the day as being calm and placid, and resolves to explore the lighthouse. He again begins to worry about the safety of the structure, but tries to reassure himself.  The last line reads, "The basis on which the structure rests seems to me to be chalk..."

A heading for January 4 follows, but there is no text.

==Composition==
Biographer [[Kenneth Silverman]] believes Poe began writing "The Light-House" between May and August 1849.&lt;ref name=Silverman412&gt;Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 412. {{ISBN|0-06-092331-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was never officially titled.&lt;ref name=Silverman412/&gt;

It is uncertain how the story would have ended and there is some debate if "The Light-House" was intended as a short story or a novel. Silverman speculates that the work might have been complete in its two-page form and the final blank entry implied the narrator's death.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 412–413. {{ISBN|0-06-092331-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely the last fiction work Poe wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 414. {{ISBN|0-06-092331-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
{{Original research|date=December 2007}}
Themes of foreboding,&lt;ref name=Silverman412/&gt; isolation and [[paranoia]] are apparent in "The Light-House".

Its style is very straightforward and plainspoken, in contrast to the more elaborate and decorated prose of Poe's earlier stories, implying a shift in Poe's writing style which the author did not live to realize.

Like many of Poe's works, "The Light-House" has been studied autobiographically. The lighthouse keeper, then, stands in for Poe himself, who is expressing his own feelings of being alone and isolated and questioning if he can survive.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 413. {{ISBN|0-06-092331-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very similar in theme to the later and also unfinished short story "[[The Burrow (story)|The Burrow]]" by [[Franz Kafka]]. Both involve a reclusive narrator who obsesses over the safety of his enclosure, though Kafka's work was much closer to completion and, consequentially, much more elaborate.  Given the obscurity of Poe's story, it is very unlikely that Kafka had read it.
[[File:Fantastic 195301-02 v1 n2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'' published Robert Bloch's story based on the Poe fragment as "A '''New''' Edgar Allan Poe Masterpiece".]]

==Inspiration==
Author and surgeon Dr. [[Richard Selzer]] included his short story 'Poe's Light-house', inspired by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s 'The Light-House', in 'The Doctor Stories', published by Picador. [[Joyce Carol Oates]] also used Poe's "The Light-House" as an inspiration for the story 'Poe Posthumous, or The Light-House' in her collection ''Wild Nights!'' (2008). Leigh M. Lane's ''Finding Poe'' (2012) speculates the role Poe's own works, including "The Lighthouse", may have played in his mysterious death.

==Adaptations==
Author [[Robert Bloch]] finished Poe's tale and published it in the February 1969 issue (#53) of ''Famous Monsters of Filmland'' as "Horror in the Lighthouse". An earlier version appeared in the January/February 1953 Ziff-Davis publication ''Fantastic'' entitled "The Lighthouse".

In addition to Bloch's adaption of "The Light-House", in the TV show ''[[The Following]]'', fictional psychopath and serial killer Joe Carroll (played by [[James Purefoy]]) writes a novel inspired by Poe's tale, titling it ''The Gothic Sea''.

In 1997 Ediciones Áltera commissioned a number of Spanish and Latin American writers to complete the story, each in their own manner. They included [[Cristina Fernández Cubas]], whose version is included in her anthology “Todos los cuentos” (Tusquets editores, 2008).

A 2016 film, ''Edgar Allan Poe‘s Lighthouse Keeper'',&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, B. (2016). Edgar Allan Poe’s Lighthouse Keeper. USA. Retrieved from https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3181898/&lt;/ref&gt; was loosely based on the story. While themes of isolation and unease in the building were preserved, the film took inspiration from Roger Corman's Poe adaptations from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, B. (2016). Edgar Allan Poe's Lighthouse Keeper website. Available at: http://www.lighthousekeepermovie.com/. (accessed 25/09/2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

The cover stories "Being There", Mark McKenna's investigation of key Australian historian [[Manning Clark]], and [[Wendi Deng|Wendi Deng Murdoch]], [[Eric Ellis (journalist)|Eric Ellis]]'s profile of the then-wife of media mogul [[Rupert Murdoch]] were around 10,000 words long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s1916646.htm|title=Spiked!|work=[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]|date=3 May 2007|accessdate=17 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in 2006, ''The Monthly'' published "Information Idol: How [[Google]] is making us stupid" by [[Gideon Haigh]], and "The Tall Man: [[2004 Palm Island death in custody|Palm Island's]] Heart of Darkness" by [[Chloe Hooper]] which was extended to the book ''[[The Tall Man: Death and Life on Palm Island]]'' in 2008.

'''''The Stages of Life''''' ({{lang-de|Die Lebensstufen}}) is an  [[allegory|allegorical]] [[oil painting]] of 1835 by the [[German Romanticism|German Romantic]] [[Landscape art|landscape]] painter [[Caspar David Friedrich]]. Completed just five years before his death, this picture, like many of his works, forms a meditation both on his own mortality and on the transience of life.

The painting is set on a sea shore and shows in the foreground an aged man with his back turned to the viewer, walking towards two adults and two children on a hilltop overlooking a harbour.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 297&lt;/ref&gt; The figures are echoed by five ships shown in the harbour, each at a different distance from the shore, an allegorical reference to the different stages of human life, to the end of a journey, to the closeness of death.

The figures have been identified as Friedrich and his family. The aged man is the artist himself, the small boy is his young son Gustav Adolf, the young girl is his daughter Agnes Adelheid, the older girl is his daughter Emma, and the man in the top hat is his nephew Johann Heinrich.&lt;ref&gt;Börsch-Supan (1973), p. 629-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many of Friedrich's paintings were set in imagined landscapes, ''The Stages of Life'' is recognisably located at Utkiek, near Friedrich's birthplace of [[Greifswald]] in today's northeastern Germany.

==Description==

The painting depicts a [[Baltic Sea]] port in the dusk. On the sea three sailing ships returning home can be seen; the large ship in the middle has already begun to draw in its sails. Two smaller sailboats have almost reached land. The one on the right heads directly for the group of five people on the bank, who by their clothes are recognizable as townspeople. In their midst sits a boy who holds up a [[Sweden|Swedish]] pennant, while the girl beside him reaches for it. To their right sits a woman who leans toward both children with her right hand raised.

These five figures correspond to the five ships visible in the harbour beyond. The three groupings of figures (one aged man, two adults, and two children) echo the positioning of the ships at various distances from the shore as allegorical of the stages of life, and closeness to death. The central ship is thought to represent the mother, while further inshore, two small boats—references to the two children—have only just begun their voyage and still remain in shallow, clear water. To the horizon, the farthest ship disappears into the setting horizon, symbolizing the aged man's voyage from this life into the unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''100 Meisterwerke.'' "Die Lebensstufen von Caspar David Friedrich (1774-1840)." In: TV Hören und Sehen, 29 2011, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alternatively, other critics have interpreted the two ships in the distance as the mother and father sailing off to live their lives and gain experience and wisdom as parents, and the large ship closest to the shore as the old man - one who has lived a full life, built up many experiences and is finally pulling into the harbor at the end of life.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rosen:  Caspar David Friedrich and the Language of Landscape.&lt;!-- Need page number for this --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The group forms a semicircle: the children are on its farthest point; to their left and right are a younger man and the young woman. On the extreme left an older man stands looking straight ahead, outside the circle. The women and children are dressed for summer, while the old man wears a coat and a fur hat. The bow of the big ship in the middle is exactly aligned with the two children.

==Swedish pennant==
[[File:Lebesstufen detail.jpg|thumb|Detail of center section, showing children with the Swedish flag.]]
Friedrich's home town of [[Greifswald]] belonged to the [[Duchy of Pomerania]] until 1630, when the area passed to [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] as [[Swedish Pomerania]]. In 1815 it became part of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Province of Pomerania]]. The painting shows Friedrich's younger daughter Agnes Adelheid and his son Gustav Adolf holding a [[Flag of Sweden|Swedish pennant]] 20 years after the cession of Greifswald to Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;For this reason, earlier art historians believed the painting to have dated from at least before 1815&lt;/ref&gt; The view encompasses the peninsula in front of the Baltic Sea, beyond which lies Sweden. Friedrich christened his son Gustav Adolf, after the Swedish king [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden|Gustav Adolf IV]]. The Swedish writer [[Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom]] wrote of the painter,
{{cquote|Friedrich is a Pomeranian … and considers himself half-Swedish"&lt;ref&gt;"Friedrich ist Pommer… und hält sich für einen halben Schweden". In: Atterbom, Daniel Amadeus: "Reisebilder aus dem romantischen Deutschland", 1859.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Title==
In keeping with the Romantic ideals of the time, Friedrich intended his paintings to function purely in visual terms, and thus he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative. It is likely that the relatively literal title ''The Stages of Life'' was not given by the artist himself, but that the work was instead renamed during a revival of interest in the artist in the late 19th or early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.designboom.com/history/friedrich.html Caspar David Friedrich inventing Romanticism]". designboom.com.

'''''Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature''''' (''TSWL''), founded by [[Germaine Greer]] in 1982, is devoted to the study of women's literature and women's writing in general. Publishing "articles, notes, research, and reviews of literary, historicist, and theoretical work by established and emerging scholars in the field of [[List of women writers|women's literature]] and [[feminist theory]]",&lt;ref name="homepage"&gt;[https://tswl.utulsa.edu/about-journal/ "About the Journal"]. ''Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature''.&lt;/ref&gt; it has been described as the "longest-running academic journal focusing exclusively on women's writing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Medoff |first1=Jeslyn |editor1-last=Kowaleski Wallace |editor1-first=Elizabeth |title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Literary Theory |date=2009 |orig-year=1996 |publisher=Routledge |page=263 |chapter=Greer, Germaine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
[[File:Germaine Greer, 28 October 2013 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|''TSWL'' founding editor [[Germaine Greer]]]]
As part of the now-defunct Tulsa Center for the Study of Women's Literature, the journal was founded in 1982 by Germaine Greer while she was teaching at the [[University of Tulsa]]. Greer's purpose for the journal was to begin "the rehabilitation of women's literary history".&lt;ref name="greer quotation"&gt;''Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature'' 1.1 (1982): 23&lt;/ref&gt;  Following her tenure, Shari Benstock (1983–1986), Mary O’Toole (1986–1988), Holly Laird (1988–2005), and Laura Stevens (2005-2016) each served as the journal’s editor. Jennifer Airey became the editor in 2016.

The distinctive TSWL logo, present from the journal's inaugural issue, is a [[saxifrage|saxifrage flower]], captioned with a quotation from William Turner’s ''Herbal'': "The white saxifrage with the indented leafe is moste commended for the breakinge of the stone."&lt;ref name="turner quotation"&gt;''Herbal'' 3 (1568): 68&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal's editorial and advisory boards include scholars prominent in their fields. Board members include [[Nina auerbach|Nina Auerbach]], [[Marilyn Butler]], [[Carol T. Christ]], [[Helen Cooper (professor)|Helen Cooper]], [[Sandra Gilbert|Sandra M. Gilbert]], [[Susan Gubar]], [[Peggy Kamuf]], and [[Jane Marcus]].&lt;ref name="boards"&gt;[http://www.utulsa.edu/tswl/advisory_and_editorial_boards.htm 5]''Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature'' Advisory and Editorial Boards&lt;/ref&gt;

Vtape was established in 1980 by artists [[Lisa Steele]], Susan Britton, Rodney Werden, [[Clive Robertson (artist)|Clive Robertson]] and [[Colin Campbell (artist)|Colin Campbell]] with the mission to improve the distribution and dissemination of video art and to compensate artists fairly for their work. It was incorporated as a not-for-profit in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.vtape.org/history|website=www.vtape.org|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vtape provided organizational assistance for independent art exhibitions throughout the 1980s and 1990s during conditions of intensive censorship of artists' film and video works by the Government of Ontario.&lt;ref name="AGOSteele"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vtape’s Toronto New Work Shows Revisited - Program 1 {{!}} AGO Art Gallery of Ontario|url=https://www.ago.net/vtape1|website=www.ago.net|accessdate=5 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aboriginal Collection==
Vtape began a dedicated collection of video works by Aboriginal artists in 1994, after being approached by [[Zachary Longboy]]. It is the only specialized collection within the organization, and the only collection at Vtape that will accept works on film and works by first-time artists. Longboy helped develop the collection as Vtape's Aboriginal outreach coordinator, and was succeeded by [[Cynthia Lickers-Sage]]. As outreach coordinator, Lickers-Sage broadened the collection's reach through the establishment of the [[ImagineNATIVE Film + Media Arts Festival|imagineNative Film Festival]] in 1998. The foundation of the [[Aboriginal Digital Access Project]] in 2012 broadened access to this special collection by allowing curators from around the world to preview video and film works online, rather than at the archive in person.&lt;ref name="Quanz" /&gt;

{{History of printing}}

'''Woodblock printing''' (or block printing) is a technique for [[printing]] text, [[image]]s or patterns used widely throughout [[East Asia]] and originating in [[China]] in antiquity as a method of [[textile printing|printing on textiles]] and later [[paper]]. As a [[Woodblock printing on textiles|method of printing on cloth]], the earliest surviving examples from [[China]] date to before 220 AD. Woodblock printing existed in [[Tang China]] during the 7th century AD and remained the most common East Asian method of printing books and other texts, as well as images, until the 19th century. ''[[Ukiyo-e]]'' is the best known type of [[Japan]]ese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique for printing images on paper are covered by the art term [[woodcut]], except for the [[#15th-century Europe|block-books]] produced mainly in the 15th century in India.

==Seals and stamps==
Prior to the invention of woodblock printing, seals and stamps were used for making impressions. The oldest of these seals came from Mesopotamia and Egypt. The use of round "[[cylinder seal]]s" for rolling an impress onto [[clay tablet]]s goes back to early [[Mesopotamia]]n civilization before 3000 BC, where they are the most common works of art to survive, and feature complex and beautiful images. A few much larger brick (e.g. 13&amp;times;13&amp;nbsp;cm) [[impression seal|stamp]]s for marking clay bricks survive from [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]] from around 2270 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoyencollection.com/pre1450.html#21.1 Schoyen collection]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also [[Roman lead pipe inscription]]s of some length that were stamped, and [[amulet MS 5236]] may be a unique surviving gold foil sheet stamped with an [[amulet]] text in the 6th&amp;nbsp;century BC.  However none of these used ink, which is necessary for printing (on a proper definition), but stamped marks into relatively soft materials. In both China and Egypt, the use of [[scaraboid seal|small stamp]]s for seals preceded the use of larger blocks. In Europe and India, the printing of cloth certainly preceded the printing of paper or papyrus; this was probably also the case in China. The process is essentially the same—in Europe special presentation impressions of [[old master print|prints]] were often printed on [[silk]] until at least the 17th century.

==Technique==
[[File:Woodcut Press Skeen 1872.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut press, from engraving in Early Typography by William Skeen, Colombo, Ceylon, 1872]]The wood block is carefully  prepared as a [[relief print|relief]] pattern, which means the areas to show 'white' are cut away with a knife, chisel, or sandpaper leaving the characters or image to show in 'black' at the original surface level. The block was cut along the grain of the wood. It is necessary only to ink the block and bring it into firm and even contact with the paper or cloth to achieve an acceptable print. The content would of course print "in reverse" or mirror-image, a further complication when text was involved. The art of carving the woodcut is technically known as ''[[xylography]]'', though the term is rarely used in English.

For colour printing, multiple blocks are used, each for one colour, although overprinting two colours may produce further colours on the print. Multiple colours can be printed by keying the paper to a frame around the woodblocks.

There are three methods of printing to consider:
[[Image:Textildruckmodel - Indien um 1900.jpg|upright|thumb|Woodblock for textile printing, India, about 1900, 22&amp;times;17&amp;times;8 cm]]
; Stamping: Used for many fabrics, and most early European woodcuts (1400–40). These  items were printed by putting paper or fabric on a table or a flat surface with the block on top, and pressing, or hammering, the back of the block.
; Rubbing: Apparently the most common for Far Eastern printing. Used for European woodcuts and block-books later in the 15th century, and very widely for cloth. The block is placed face side up on a table, with the paper or fabric on top. The back of the paper or fabric is rubbed with a "hard pad, a flat piece of wood, a burnisher, or a leather frotton".&lt;ref name="Hind"&gt;An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, p64-94, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Printing in a press: "Presses" only seem to have been used in Asia in relatively recent times. Simple weighted presses may have been used in Europe, but firm evidence is lacking. Later, printing-presses were used (from about 1480). A deceased Abbess of [[Mechelen]] in [[Flanders]] in 1465 had "unum instrumentum ad imprintendum scripturas et ymagines ... cum 14 aliis lapideis printis" ("an instrument for printing texts and pictures ... with 14 stones for printing") which is probably too early to be a [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]-type printing press in that location.&lt;ref name="Hind"/&gt;

In addition, ''jia xie'' is a method for dyeing textiles (usually silk) using wood blocks invented in the 5th-6th centuries in China. An upper and a lower block is made, with carved out compartments opening to the back, fitted with plugs. The cloth, usually folded a number of times, is inserted and clamped between the two blocks. By unplugging the different compartments and filling them with dyes of different colours, a multi-coloured pattern can be printed over quite a large area of folded cloth. The method is not strictly printing however, as the pattern is not caused by pressure against the block.&lt;ref name="cave"&gt;Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed), "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas", 1990, British Museum publications, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour woodblock printing===
[[File:Hiroshige A large waterfall.jpg|thumb|upright|''Mino province: Yoro-taki'' from the series ''Views of Famous Places in the Sixty-odd Provinces'' by [[Hiroshige]], an [[ukiyo-e]] artist]]

The earliest woodblock printing known is in colour—[[China|Chinese]] [[silk]] from the [[Han dynasty]] printed in three colours.&lt;ref name="cave" /&gt;
On paper, European woodcut prints with coloured blocks were invented in Germany in 1508 and are known as [[chiaroscuro woodcut]]s.

Colour is very common in Asian woodblock printing on paper; in [[China]] the first known example is a Diamond sutra of 1341, printed in black and red at the Zifu Temple in modern-day Hubei province. The earliest dated book printed in more than 2 colours is ''Chengshi moyuan'' ({{zh|程氏墨苑}}), a book on ink-cakes printed in 1606 and the technique reached its height in books on art published in the first half of the 17th century. Notable examples are the [[Hu Zhengyan]]'s ''Treatise on the Paintings and Writings of the Ten Bamboo Studio'' of 1633,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shi zhu zhai shu hua pu|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-FH-00910-00083-00098/1|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Manual of the Mustard Seed Garden|''Mustard Seed Garden Painting Manual'']] published in 1679 and 1701.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L. |last=Sickman |first2=A. |last2=Soper |title=The Art and Architecture of China |series=Pelican History of Art |edition=3rd |year=1971 |location= |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-14-056110-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]], a multi-colour technique called ''[[nishiki-e]]'' ("brocade pictures") spread more widely, and was used for prints from the 1760s on. Japanese woodcut became a major artistic form, although at the time it was accorded a much lower status than painting.

In both Europe and Japan, book illustrations were normally printed in black ink only, and colour reserved for individual artistic prints. In China, the reverse was true, and colour printing was used mainly in books on art and erotica.

==History of woodblock printing==
[[File:Yuan dynasty woodblock.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Yuan dynasty|Yuan-dynasty]] woodblock edition of a [[China|Chinese]] play]]

===Origins in Asia===
The earliest woodblock printed fragments to survive are from China and are of silk, printed with flowers in three colours from the [[Han dynasty]] (before AD 220).&lt;ref name="cave"/&gt; It is clear that woodblock printing developed in Asia several centuries before Europe.  The Chinese were the first to use the process to print solid text, and equally that, much later, in Europe the printing of images on cloth developed into the printing of images on paper ([[woodcut]]s). It is also now established that the use in Europe of the same process to print substantial amounts of text together with images in block-books only, came about four hundred years after the development of [[movable type]] by [[Bi Sheng]] (990–1051) during the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] of China, .

[[File:WoodcutBuddaChina.jpg|thumb|Coloured woodcut Buddha, 10th century, China]]

In China, an alternative to woodblock printing was a system of [[reprography]] since the Han Dynasty using carved stone [[stele]]s to reproduce pages of text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berner |first=R. Thomas |title=The Ancient Chinese Process of Reprography |journal=Technology and Culture |volume=38 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=424–431 |jstor=3107128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The three necessary components for woodblock printing are the wood block, which carries the design cut in [[relief carving|relief]]; dye or [[ink]], which had been widely used in the ancient world; and either [[cloth]] or [[paper]], which was first developed in China, around the 3rd century BC or 2nd century BC. Woodblock printing on [[papyrus]] seems never to have been practised, although it would be possible.

A few specimen of wood block printing, possibly called ''tarsh'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], have been excavated from a 10th-century context in [[History of Arab Egypt|Arabic Egypt]]. They were mostly used for prayers and amulets. The technique may be spread from China or an independent invention, but had very little impact and virtually disappeared at the end of the 14th century.&lt;ref name=Bulliet&gt;Richard W. Bulliet (1987), "[http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos107-3-1987-rwb.pdf Medieval Arabic Tarsh: A Forgotten Chapter in the History of Printing]", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''107''' (3), pp. 427–438.&lt;/ref&gt; In India the main importance of the technique has always been as a method of printing textiles, which has been a large industry since at least the 10th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jameelcentre.ashmolean.org/collection/6/1272/1274|title=Ashmolean − Eastern Art Online, Yousef Jameel Centre for Islamic and Asian Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large quantities of printed Indian silk and [[cotton]] were exported to Europe throughout the [[Modern period]].

Because [[Chinese written language|Chinese]] has a [[character set]] running into the thousands, woodblock printing suits it better than [[movable type]] to the extent that characters only need to be created as they occur in the text. Although the Chinese had invented a form of movable type with baked clay in the 11th century, and metal movable type was invented in Korea in the 13th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koreanhero.net/fiftywonders/FiftyWonders2_English.pdf |title=Fifty Wonders |publisher=Korean Hero |date= |accessdate=2013-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904181045/http://www.koreanhero.net/fiftywonders/FiftyWonders2_English.pdf |archive-date=2012-09-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; woodblocks continued to be preferred owing to the formidable challenges of typesetting Chinese text with its 40,000 or more characters. Also, the objective of printing in the East may have been more focused on standardization of ritual text (such as the Buddhist canon [[Tripitaka]], requiring 80,000 woodblocks), and the purity of validated woodblocks could be maintained for centuries.&lt;ref name=christensen&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rightreading.com/printing/gutenberg.asia/gutenberg-asia-1-introduction.htm | title=Did East Asian Printing Traditions Influence the European Renaissance? | author=Thomas Christensen | accessdate=2006-10-18 | year= 2007 | publisher = Arts of Asia Magazine (to appear) }}&lt;/ref&gt; When there was a need for the reproduction of a text, the original block could simply be brought out again, while moveable type necessitated error-prone composition of distinct "editions".

In China, [[Korea]], and [[Japan]], the state involved itself in printing at a relatively early stage; initially only the government had the resources to finance the carving of the blocks for long works. The difference between East Asian woodblock printing and the Western [[printing press]] had major implications for the development of book culture and book markets in East Asia and Europe.

===Early printed books in China and Korea===
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|The intricate frontispiece of the Diamond Sutra from [[Tang Dynasty]] China, the world's earliest dated printed book, AD 868 ([[British Library]])]]

Woodblock printing in China is strongly associated with [[Buddhism]], which encouraged the spread of charms and sutras. In the Tang Dynasty, a [[Chinese people|Chinese]] writer named Fenzhi first mentioned in his book "Yuan Xian San Ji" that the woodblock was used to print Buddhist scriptures during the Zhenguan years (AD 627~649).

The oldest existing print done with wood-blocks was discovered in 1974 in an excavation in [[Xi'an]] (the capital of Tang-Dynasty China, then called [[Chang'an]]), [[Shaanxi]], China, whereby individual sheets of paper were pressed into wooden blocks with the text and illustrations carved into them.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pan |first=Jixing |title=On the Origin of Printing in the Light of New Archaeological Discoveries |journal=Chinese Science Bulletin |year=1997 |volume=42 |issue=12 |pages=976–981 [pp. 979–980] |issn=1001-6538 |doi=10.1007/BF02882611 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a ''[[dharani]]'' sutra printed on [[hemp]] paper and dated to 650 to 670 AD, during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907).&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"/&gt; Another printed document dating to the early half of the Chinese Tang Dynasty has also been found, the ''Saddharma pundarika'' sutra printed from 690 to 699.&lt;ref name="pan 1997 179 180"/&gt;

[[File:Dharani sutra.jpg|thumb|left|Dharani sutra replica exhibited at [[National Museum of Korea]]]]

An early example of woodblock printing on paper is [[The Great Dharani Sutra]] that is dated between AD 704 and 751. It was found at [[Bulguksa]], [[South Korea]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/north-korea/7.htm North Korea&amp;nbsp;— Silla Countrystudies.us] accessed 2009-12-03; [http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla62/62-yosz.htm ''A History of Writings in Japanese and Current Studies in the Field of Rare Books in Japan''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120130752/http://www.ifla.org/IV/ifla62/62-yosz.htm |date=2008-11-20 }} - 62nd IFLA General Conference, Ifla.org, accessed 009-12-03; [http://www.rightreading.com/printing/gutenberg.asia/gutenberg-asia-9-korea.htm ''Gutenberg and the Koreans: The Invention of Movable Metal Type Printing in Korea''], Rightreading.com, 2006-09-13, accessed 2009-12-03; [http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000594295&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002187369&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;Menu_code=0000008846&amp;sub_menu= Cho Woo-suk, ''JoongAng Daily'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719081555/http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000594295&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002187369&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;Menu_code=0000008846&amp;sub_menu= |date=2011-07-19 }}, November 22, 2004, Eng.buddhapia.com, accessed 2009-12-03; [http://jikimi.cha.go.kr/newinfo/Culresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=11,01260600,37&amp;queryText=V_KDCD=11 National Treasure No. 126-6], by the Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea (in Korean), jikimi.cha.go.kr, accessed 2009-12-28; [https://books.google.com/books?id=MziRd4ddZz4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+world+history:+ancient,+medieval,+and+modern%22+by+Peter+N.+Stearns&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y5dGg9u9uJ&amp;sig=u9uP_DdhfHi8qza6fEK1KldlhQM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=upboTP3MK8Kblge0-6nWCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false National Treasure No. 126-6, by the Cultural Heritage Administration of South Korea (in Korean)]&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Buddhist]] text was printed on a {{convert|8|x|630|cm|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Paper Mulberry|mulberry]] paper scroll in the early Korean Kingdom of [[Unified Silla]]. Another version of the Dharani sutra, printed in Japan around AD 770, is also frequently cited as an example of early printing. One million copies of the sutra, along with other prayers, were ordered to be produced by [[Empress Shōtoku]]. As each copy was then stored in a tiny wooden pagoda, the copies are together known as the ''[[Hyakumantō Darani]]'' (百万塔陀羅尼, "1,000,000 towers/pagodas Darani").

The world's earliest dated (AD 868) printed book is a Chinese scroll about sixteen feet long containing the text of the [[Diamond Sutra]]. It was found in 1907 by the [[archaeologist]] Sir [[Marc Aurel Stein]] in the [[Mogao Caves]] of [[Dunhuang]], and is currently in the possession of the [[British Library]]. The book displays a great maturity of design and layout and speaks of a considerable ancestry for woodblock printing. The [[colophon (book)|colophon]], at the inner end, reads: ''Reverently [caused to be] made for universal free distribution by Wang Jie on behalf of his two parents on the 13th of the 4th moon of the 9th year of Xiantong [i.e. 11 May, AD 868 ]''.

[[File:Pen ts'ao, woodblock book 1249-ce.png|thumb|Finely crafted books — like the ''[[Compendium of Materia Medica]]'' shown above — were produced in China as early as the ninth century.&lt;ref name="meggs24"&gt;{{cite book |last=Meggs |first=Philip B. |title=A History of Graphic Design |location= |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=1998 |page=24 |isbn=0-471-29198-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In late 10th century China the complete Buddhist canon [[Tripitaka]] of 130,000 pages was printed with blocks, which took between 1080 and 1102, and many other very long works were printed. Early books were on [[scroll]]s, but [[Traditional Chinese bookbinding|other book formats]] were developed. First came the ''Jingzhe zhuang'' or "sutra binding", a scroll folded concertina-wise, which avoided the need to unroll half a scroll to see a passage in the middle. About AD 1000 "butterfly binding" was developed; two pages were printed on a sheet, which was then folded inwards. The sheets were then pasted together at the fold to make a [[codex]] with alternate openings of printed and blank pairs of pages. In the 14th century the folding was reversed outwards to give continuous printed pages, each backed by a blank hidden page. Later the bindings were sewn rather than pasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |title=Dunhuang concertina binding findings |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000309034110/http://idp.bl.uk/IDP/bookbinding/CONCERTINA-FRAMESET.html |archivedate=2000-03-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only relatively small volumes (''[[:wiktionary:菤|juan 卷]]'') were bound up, and several of these would be enclosed in a cover called a ''tao'', with wooden boards at front and back, and loops and pegs to close up the book when not in use. For example, one complete Tripitaka had over 6,400 ''juan'' in 595 ''tao''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nb.no/baser/schoyen/5/5.18/#2540]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese woodblock prints===
[[File:The Great Wave off Kanagawa.jpg|thumb|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa|Under the Wave off Kanagawa]]'' by [[Hokusai]], an [[ukiyo-e]] artist]]
{{Main|Woodblock printing in Japan}}

The earliest known woodblock printing dates from 764-770, when Empress Shotoku commissioned one million small wooden [[pagoda]]s containing short printed scrolls—typically {{convert|6|x|45|cm|abbr=on}}—to be distributed to temples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nb.no/baser/schoyen/5/5.18/#2489]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the production of [[Buddhist]] texts, which became widespread from the 11th century in Japan, the process was only adopted in Japan for secular books surprisingly late, and a [[Chinese language|Chinese]]-[[Japanese language|Japanese]] dictionary of 1590 is the earliest known example.

Though the [[Jesuits]] operated a [[movable type]] [[printing-press]] in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], printing equipment&lt;ref name=Lane&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Richard Douglas Lane |last=Lane |first=Richard |year=1978 |title=Images of the Floating World |location=Old Saybrook, CT |publisher=Konecky &amp; Konecky |page=33 |isbn=1-56852-481-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]'s army seized from [[Korea]] in 1593&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Bonds of Civility: Aesthetic Networks and the Political Origins of Japanese Culture|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KsN81J1s70kC|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2005-02-28|isbn = 9780521601153|language = en|first = Eiko|last = Ikegami}}&lt;/ref&gt; had far greater influence on the development of the medium. Four years later, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], even before becoming ''[[shōgun]]'', effected the creation of the first native movable type,&lt;ref name=Lane/&gt; using wooden type-pieces rather than metal. He oversaw the creation of 100,000 type-pieces, which were used to print a number of political and historical texts.

An edition of the [[Confucius|Confucian]] ''[[Analects]]'' was printed in 1598, using a Korean moveable type printing press, at the order of [[Emperor Go-Yōzei]]. This document is the oldest work of Japanese moveable type printing extant today. Despite the appeal of moveable type, however, it was soon decided that the [[running script]] style of Japanese writing would be better reproduced using woodblocks, and so woodblocks were once more adopted; by 1640 they were once again being used for nearly all purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sansom |first=George |year=1961 |title=A History of Japan: 1334–1615 |location=Stanford, California |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology quickly gained popularity among publishers, and was used to produce affordable prints as well as books. As a result, Japan began to see something of literary mass production and increasing literacy. The content of these books varied widely, including travel guides, advice manuals, ''[[kibyōshi]]'' (satirical novels), ''[[sharebon]]'' (books on urban culture), art books, and play scripts for the ''[[Bunraku|jōruri]]'' (puppet) theatre. Often, within a certain genre, such as the ''jōruri'' theatre scripts, a particular style of writing would come to be the standard for that genre; in other words, one person's personal calligraphic style was adopted as the standard style for printing plays.

===Diffusion in Eurasia===
The technique is found through South and Central Asia, and in the [[Byzantine]] world for cloth, and by AD 1000 examples of woodblock printing on paper appear in Islamic [[Egypt]]. Printing onto cloth had spread much earlier, and was common in Europe by 1300. "In the 13th century the Chinese technique of blockprinting was transmitted to Europe",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rise of Modern China |edition= |last=Hsü |first=Immanuel C. Y. |year= 1970 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-19-501240-2 |page= 830}}&lt;/ref&gt; soon after paper became available in Europe. The [[old master print|print]] in [[woodcut]], later joined by [[engraving]], quickly became an important cultural tradition for popular religious works, as well as [[playing cards]] and other uses.&lt;ref name="Hind"/&gt;

Many early Chinese examples, such as the Diamond Sutra (above) contain images, mostly Buddhist, that are often elaborate. Later, some notable artists designed woodblock images for books, but the separate artistic print did not develop in China as it did in Europe and Japan. Apart from devotional images, mainly Buddhist, few "single-leaf" Chinese prints were made until the 19th century.

===15th-century Europe===

{{Main|block book}}

Block-books, where both text and images are cut on a single block for a whole page, appeared in Europe in the mid-15th century. As they were almost always undated and without statement of printer or place of printing, determining their dates of printing has been an extremely difficult task. [[Allan H. Stevenson]], by comparing the watermarks in the paper used in blockbooks with watermarks in dated documents, concluded that the "heyday" of blockbooks was the 1460s, but that at least one dated from about 1451.&lt;ref name="Carter p. 46"&gt;[[#Carter|Carter]] p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan H. Stevenson, ''The Quincentennnial of Netherlandish Blockbooks'', British Museum Quarterly, Vol. 31, No. 3/4 (Spring 1967), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Block books printed in the 1470s were often of cheaper quality, as a cheaper alternative to books printed by [[printing press]].&lt;ref&gt;Master E.S., Alan Shestack, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  Block books continued to be  printed sporadically up through the end of the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Carter p. 46"/&gt;

The most famous block-books are the [[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]] and the [[Ars moriendi]], though in this the images and text are on different pages, but all block-cut. The [[Biblia pauperum]], a Biblical picture-book, was the next most common title, and the great majority of block-books were popular devotional works. All block-books are fairly short at less than fifty pages. While in Europe movable metal type soon became cheap enough to replace woodblock printing for the reproduction of text, woodcuts remained a major way to reproduce images in illustrated works of early modern European printing. (''See also:'' [[Old master print]].)

Most block-books before about 1480 were printed on only one side of the paper&amp;nbsp;— if they were printed by rubbing it would be difficult to print on both sides without damaging the first one to be printed. Many were printed with two pages per sheet, producing a book with opening of two printed pages, followed by openings with two blank pages (as earlier in China). The blank pages were then glued together to produce a book looking like a type-printed one. Where both sides of a sheet have been printed, it is presumed a [[printing-press]] was used.

The method was also used extensively for printing [[playing cards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://trionfi.com/0/p/20/ created 2003 - 2005        Early Card painters and Printers in Germany, Austria and Flanders (14th and 15th century)]. Retrieved 28 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further development in East Asia===

In East Asia, woodblock printing proved to be more enduring than in Europe, continuing well into the 19th century as the major form of printing texts, especially in China, even after the introduction of the European printing press.

In countries using Arabic, Turkish and similar scripts, works, especially the [[Qur'an]] were sometimes printed by [[lithography]] in the 19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answering-islam.org/Books/Zwemer/Translations/index.htm |title=Qur'an translations |publisher=Answering-islam.org |date= |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the links between the characters require compromises when movable type is used which were considered inappropriate for sacred texts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

[[Nianhua]] were a form of [[color|coloured]] woodblock prints in China, depicting images for decoration during the [[Chinese New Year]].

Dr. Henry, in his "Notes on the Economic Botany of China," refers to your wish to obtain specimens of the woods used in China for printing blocks. The name which the neighbouring city of [[Wuchang District|Wuchang]] enjoys for the excellence of its printing work has led me to inquire into the woods used there, and I am sending you specimens of them by parcel post. The wood which is considered the best is the Veng li mu, which has been identified as the [[Pyrus communis|Pyrus betulcefolia]], Bunge., and which grows in this Province. Slabs of this wood 1 ft. x 6 ins. x 1^ in. cost 150 cash, or about 5½.d. A cheaper wood generally used for printing proclamations is the tu chung mu. [[Eucommia ulmoides]], Oliv., has been determined to be the tu chung mu. The tu chung here used is a native of this Province. A wood used in [[Kiangsu]] is the yin hsing mu, which is one of the names of the Salisburia adiantifolia. Boxwood, huang yang mu, is obtained from [[Szechuen]], but only in small pieces, which are mainly used for cutting the stamps used for private seals on letters and documents. &lt;br&gt;

In the third volume of the Japanese work, the "So Mokn Sei Fu," a drawing is given of the huang yang, together with a quotation from the Chinese Materia Medica, which speaks of the tree as growing an inch a year, except in these years which have an intercalary moon, when it grows backwards. From this it would appear to be a slow growing tree.

Block printing has also been extensively used for decorative purposes such as [[Textile|fabric]]s, [[leather]]s and [[wallpaper]]. This is easiest with repetitive patterns composed of one or a small number of [[motif (art)|motifs]] that are small to medium in size (due to the difficulty of carving and handling larger blocks). For a multi-colour pattern, each colour element is carved as a separate block and individually inked and applied. Block printing was the standard method of producing [[wallpaper]] until the early 20th century, and is still used by a few traditionalist firms. It also remains in use for making cloth, mostly in small artisanal settings, for example in [[India]].

[[William Morris]] was one artist who used woodblock printing to produce patterned wallpaper and textiles during the late 19th century. Examples of Morris' work are housed in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]]. The museum also holds a number of Morris' original woodblocks, which are still in limited use.
